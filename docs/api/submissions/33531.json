Feel free to express concern about her knowing her limits with alcohol, but I beg you, don\u2019t cut off her safe space. As women we should be able to go out and have fun safely, but sometimes it\u2019s not the case.

Whatever if it was a once off, then of course I would say not to tell her parents, but if it\u2019s happening frequently that she\u2019s getting drunk to the point of becoming incapacitated then something needs to be said. If you\u2019re close enough to her, you could express your concern to her directly before telling her parents? That way you don\u2019t have to rat her out and you can maybe help her reflect on how she drinks.", "YTA. Do you want to continue to be her safe person? If you do then don't tell her parents.

Did you talk to her about the dangers of drinking too much?  Did you ask her if she enjoyed throwing up on herself??  \n\nYOU are the safe space for her.    Talk to her.  It sounds to me like she is not breaking any laws.  She is not hurting anyone, except maybe herself.\n\nTalk to her about her life choices - college/job/relationships etc.  Is her drinking affecting any of these??   Then encourage her to get help.\n\nTelling her parents probably isn't going to help her in any way.   What will her parents do?  Cut off her education even if she is passing all of her classes??  Kick her out of the house even if she makes it to her job every day??    How will it help?? \n\nIs this a one off thing?   When I was in college, I had a night like this.  It was terrible and i didn't drink for several months and carefully watched my drinking afterwards.     \n\nLeaning towards YTA.   Telling her parents does not HELP in any way.

That may leave her in some risky situations.", "If your next door neighbor has a habit of getting drunk and throwing up in his yard, do you call his parents? She\u2019s an adult. Speak to her as an adult to an adult. Her parents have nothing to do with this.", "YWBTA.  She\u2019s doing the safer thing by calling you instead of driving drunk.  She trusts you as her safe person which is a big deal.  I\u2019ve told my children if they are ever drunk, they can can call me 24/7 to pick them up and there will be no punishment (this part is for if they are under 18).   I also extend that offer to anyone they know.  Getting them home safely and preventing a potential drunk driving situation is far more important than the inconvenience to me.  If it becomes a habit, talk to her with love and concern, but don\u2019t shatter that trust.", "I don't think you'd be an asshole for it but you wouldn't do yourself much good. If she didn't have you to call who does she have? She clearly wouldn't go to her parents since she didn't.

I understand being concerned and wanting to tell her parents, but I think you\u2019d be an AH if you did without having a conversation with your niece first. \n\nYour niece is in her early days of being allowed to drink. It\u2019s great that she has you to be her safe person. Even adults need safe people. I think you need to talk to her first, because if you jump straight to telling her parents she might not call you next time.\n\nI think there are a lot of factors to consider. There\u2019s a big difference to me between going out all the time and getting vomit on yourself drunk and going a little too hard every once in a while for a friend\u2019s birthday or something. I\u2019d want to know if she was still finding her limits with alcohol or if she was just trying to get blind drunk. It\u2019s a nuanced issue that requires a conversation.", "Ywbta if you go straight to her parents without having a conversation with her first. She's legally an adult and is of legal drinking age, so do her the respect of taking to her like one, before you go tattling. \n\nPoint out that you don't mind being the one she calls, but that you are a bit concerned with how much she's drinking.

But maybe you don\u2019t care that that\u2019s a possibility for women? I don\u2019t know. \n\nI think if you\u2019re genuinely concerned about her well-being you should talk to her about her drinking habits. And if there are red flags there then maybe talking to the parents is important. But it just sounds like you want to hear people say you shouldn\u2019t take care of her while patting yourself on the back for doing the right thing. \n\nI guess YTA?

Wanting to tell her parents that their kid might have a drinking problem wouldn\u2019t make you TA. But you need to figure out WHY you want to tell her parents and definitely speak to her first.

That's a very important thing to her and I imagine there's a certain amount of satisfaction knowing that your niece looks up to you as such.  So again, like others recommended,  you can have a conversation directly with her and perhaps fill her in on the many ways that one can drink and have a good time without becoming \"somebody hold my hair\" drunk.    When I talk to my younger cousins I thank them for waking me up at 3 in the morning to ask me to get them safely home or to my place. I make sure they know that I can live with being tired the next day but I couldn't bear the thought of  finding out they were injured or killed in a drunk driving accident. \n\nIf you want to use my reasonable drinking talking points feel free.\n\n1) 50/50 blends are a hangover not a drink.\n2) if the drink taste like crap dump it and make a new one that actually taste good.\n3) tell your bartender you are working on enjoying the whole evening and ask if they can make one shot spread over 4 drinks.  It's a weird ask but I think they get it and I've only had one bartender say they couldn't.  The beauty of this is that you get the taste you are looking for and you get 4 drinks for the price of one.\n4) if you are going to be drinking all night eat a tablespoon of brewer's yeast before you go out.  It helps breakdown the alcohol in your stomach first somehow and your liver will thank you in the morning.  Plus it seems to help prevent becoming blackout drunk which can be very helpful when trying to recognize and avoid sketchy situations.\n5) make absolutely certain they know that you are there for them whenever the need that ride no questions asked\n\nIf it does become a serious problem then you may need to get n her parents involved but please remind those parents that if they come across as lecturing and start attacking her they can kill her willingness to ask for help when she needs it and that may increase  the likelihood of her driving or riding with someone that is also drunk and she might get injured or injure someone else god forbid.\n\nTL;DR\nNAH\nshe is young and learning so take this trust and teach responsible drinking and only involve her parents if absolutely necessary to prevent the loss of life or serious injuries.", "very well said", "Yes parents do have a right to know if their child is on a path of destruction.

It simply is not healthy or normal for a nineteen year old to be frequently getting drunk enough that they vomit all over their hair and have to have their clothes changed for them. It\u2019s absolutely normal to party and get drunk, but not to the point that you\u2019re incapacitated. I am a firm believer in everyone having one night where they get absolutely blackout drunk and then learn from it and never do it again, because they learn their limit.

Two times being overly drunk at that age isn\u2019t outlandish and your overreaction is hinting that you have some type of issue/trauma with alcohol.

What if OP does not want to be that safe space?
