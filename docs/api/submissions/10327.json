It was around 3:30am when they left but still it was annoying because it woke everyone up.\n\nSo today, I'm taking out the bins, (theres around 8 bins) and noticed the neighbours little kid walk up to me.\n\nThe kid says \"are you taking out the bins?\" I replied with \"yes\" and she then says \"mummy told me to tell you that she doesn't like that and it wakes her up\".\n\nI was quite suprised that instead of the mother coming out to talk to me, she instead sends out her 6 year old kid while she lays in bed.\n\nI smiled and said \"tell your mum that I don't like it when she makes noise at 3am, it wakes me up.\"\n\n\nMy friend is calling me an asshole because i should of waited till the neighbour woke up but most people agree with me.\n\nAita?\n\nEDIT*\n\n 1st of all, It's not my responsibility to look after *her* kid. It was the *MOTHER* that sent her *6 YEAR OLD* to talk to a random stranger. \n \nI live in a safe community but still wouldn't let a child go talk to a stranger so that I could get a few more hours of sleep time. \n\n2nd of all, I appreciate everyone's comments so thank you for that.

Though instead of using a child to deliver a message again, either talk to the neighbour or make a noise complaint *every* single time it\u2019s past 12am.", "NTA. It sounds like you and your neighbors have an understanding of helping each other out with taking out the bins. If your neighbor has an issue with it, she should communicate with you herself instead of sending her child to do it. It's also hypocritical of her to complain about being woken up by the sound of the bins being taken out when she herself has been making loud noise until 4 am. It's reasonable to expect a certain level of consideration and respect from your neighbors, and it seems like you were respectful in your response to the child.", "honestly NTA, but I\u2019d go talk to the neighbor about it before anymore issues arise", "NTA\n\nThe nerve of your neighbour to party until 3-4 am while she has a child and neighbours trying to sleep and then complain that about you taking the bins out at 10 am. She sounds like an AH and a pathetic person. I would confront her directly and call her out on her behaviour. If all the neighbours complain to the the manager/landlord perhaps you can get her evicted.", "NTA for one, I would be grateful if my neighbor did this for me! \n\nI guess it would depend, what time did you take the bins out? Like was it 1am or something or a reasonable time? \n\nIt would have made much more sense for the mother to come out.

Why wait?", "NTA. Hope that teaches her not to send her spawn out to hound you. Call child services on her.", "NTA and I wouldn\u2019t move her bins anymore. If she confronts you about it just say you didn\u2019t want to wake her up by moving her bins. Continue to move yours and everyone else\u2019s but if she\u2019s gonna complain then let her do her own chores.", "NTA, if she has a problem, she should be telling you herself, not sending out her six year old as a scapegoat. And she is being a massive hypocrite for complaining about noise if she is partying till 3-4am.", "NTA *but* my heart breaks for that child, it sounds like their mother could be struggling with an addiction. They probably go to a school with counselors that could help them through that situation if you suspect serious neglect or abuse. No amount of suffering the mother has endured can justify making her daughter suffer. Also it is hypocritical of her to be upset about you making noise during your waking hours to do her a favor while she had just made more noise hours earlier.", "NTA. Although personally if my neighbour had been partying until 3am waking everyone up and I knew she was trying to sleep at 10am, I\u2019d have death metal on as loud as I could get away with.", "NTA for taking out the bins but \n\n> I was quite suprised that instead of the mother coming out to talk to me, she instead sends out her 6 year old kid\n\nYou thought this but then you used the kid to relay your own message back so maybe a bit of one there.", "NTA", "So you know what that means, right? It's time to start taking the bins out earlier.", "NTA. Quiet time is traditionally 11pm to 8am though noise after 10pm not good at least in UK. Construction work can start at 8am because reasonable expectation everyone is awake. I'd be more sympathetic if she was working night shift but bins do need to go out and it seems if did at time convenient to her, you might miss pick up or upset other neighbours.\n\nFeel sorry for child though.", "If your neighbor is partying until 3am and has a child,  she should be reported.", "ESH, you for trying to talk over this issue with a 6 year old kid and put him in the middle instead of confronting the neighbor directly and her for creating a nuisance and being hypocritical about trash bins making noise.", "YTA\n\nYou're not the AH for taking out the bins. You are the AH for putting a six year old in the middle of your drama with the neighbor. If you aren't brave enough to say what you said to your neighbor's face, don't send the message through her six-year-old kid. YTA.", "Sorry, but ESH.\n\nYour neighbor is an ass on approximately 14 different levels, no argument from me there. \n\nBut if it's wrong of her to send her 6yo as a messenger to you, it's wrong of you to use the 6yo as a messenger back. You can either not respond, or tell the kid that their mom can come talk to you about it, but don't put the kid in the middle of your dispute. Look at their mom; they've got enough to deal with!\n\nI hope in the future you continue taking the bins out early in the morning, preferably one at a time, and banging them together and on every bump in the pavement while you do so.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

No child likes hearing from another adult that their mother isn\u2019t the best in the world and they\u2019ve done something wrong.

That, combined with her sending a 6-yo out to berate an adult stranger makes me worry for the kid.
