My dad never gave mom any surprises, or any presents or anything like that. When it came to her birthdays, he did the absolute minimum amount of work for them.\n\nWhen it came to her 50th birthday, mom raised her expectations, it being a milestone birthday. She kept asking dad over and over again (apparently, I didn't witness this myself as I was at school) if he was going to throw a party or take her somewhere, to which dad would always answer \"you'll see...\"\n\nBut of course he did basically nothing. He did not throw any party. Mom spent the entire evening of her 50th in tears because nothing happened following her partyless lunch at a restaurant.\n\nI am not sure mom ever forgave dad for this one. Their marriage was extremely rocky in later years anyway, so when they loudly fought about just about anything and everything I just used to put loud music on to drown it out.\n\nDad died 2 and a half years ago. And since then, I find a lot of mom's anger towards my dad, as well as her abusive parents, has been raining down on me.\n\nEvery year she does the same thing she used to do to dad, say \"are you throwing me a surprise party this year, are you taking me someplace\" etc, etc. Like that expectation is on me now. Every time, this inevitably leads to her crying about her 50th birthday again. But here's the thing. She now seems to be bearing a grudge against ME for it.\n\n\"YOU didn't do anything, why didn't YOU throw me a party? Why did YOU let dad not throw me a party? YOU could have done something you know, why didn't you?!\" on and on and on. \"You're just as bad as him!\" she proclaims.\n\nShe also often asks, \"why didn't you see what was happening and badger him into organizing something?!\" To which my answer is, I was in 12th grade, drowning in assignments, and it was coming up to end of semester exams. At the time, school was real stressful and I was borderline flunking two classes from being unable to keep up with the workload. I didn't have the time or headspace to listen in to my parents every exchange, conversation, and fight. But of course, she doesn't accept this as an answer and says that's no excuse, I should have still seen what was going on.\n\nThere's also the fact that mom's 50th birthday was NINE YEARS AGO. And every year since dad died (this is the third year), I still get all the flak for how her 50th went down. I feel it's not my fault and I'm just being punished for my father's wrongdoing.", "created_utc": 1669467482, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z56yjj/aita_for_not_throwing_mom_a_50th_birthday_party_9/", "score": 397, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Don't forget - put it in your calender now. Get other family members involved.

Insist that she sees a therapist, who can also teach her coping tools. We don't know what our parents' marriages were truly like.
