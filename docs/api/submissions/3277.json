My dad never gave mom any surprises, or any presents or anything like that. When it came to her birthdays, he did the absolute minimum amount of work for them.\n\nWhen it came to her 50th birthday, mom raised her expectations, it being a milestone birthday. She kept asking dad over and over again (apparently, I didn't witness this myself as I was at school) if he was going to throw a party or take her somewhere, to which dad would always answer \"you'll see...\"\n\nBut of course he did basically nothing. He did not throw any party. Mom spent the entire evening of her 50th in tears because nothing happened following her partyless lunch at a restaurant.\n\nI am not sure mom ever forgave dad for this one. Their marriage was extremely rocky in later years anyway, so when they loudly fought about just about anything and everything I just used to put loud music on to drown it out.\n\nDad died 2 and a half years ago. And since then, I find a lot of mom's anger towards my dad, as well as her abusive parents, has been raining down on me.\n\nEvery year she does the same thing she used to do to dad, say \"are you throwing me a surprise party this year, are you taking me someplace\" etc, etc. Like that expectation is on me now. Every time, this inevitably leads to her crying about her 50th birthday again. But here's the thing. She now seems to be bearing a grudge against ME for it.\n\n\"YOU didn't do anything, why didn't YOU throw me a party? Why did YOU let dad not throw me a party? YOU could have done something you know, why didn't you?!\" on and on and on. \"You're just as bad as him!\" she proclaims.\n\nShe also often asks, \"why didn't you see what was happening and badger him into organizing something?!\" To which my answer is, I was in 12th grade, drowning in assignments, and it was coming up to end of semester exams. At the time, school was real stressful and I was borderline flunking two classes from being unable to keep up with the workload. I didn't have the time or headspace to listen in to my parents every exchange, conversation, and fight. But of course, she doesn't accept this as an answer and says that's no excuse, I should have still seen what was going on.\n\nThere's also the fact that mom's 50th birthday was NINE YEARS AGO. And every year since dad died (this is the third year), I still get all the flak for how her 50th went down. I feel it's not my fault and I'm just being punished for my father's wrongdoing.", "created_utc": 1669467482, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z56yjj/aita_for_not_throwing_mom_a_50th_birthday_party_9/", "score": 130, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

A Senior in high school isn't going to be thinking about the significance of a decade birthday. Is she bringing it up more recently as a way to cue you in to she expects a lot for her 60th birthday?", "I feel sad for your mother, and worse for you.\n\nNTA - and your mother desperately needs therapy. I almost wanted to make it N A H because grief makes a person do weird things, but... it's been nine years. This has evidently turned into a coping mechanism, in which you get to take the blame for what your late father did. or didn't do.", "NTA. Your Mom\u2019s anger is displaced. It was your father\u2019s responsibility and unfortunately he\u2019s no longer around for her to blame. She needs to seek therapy because having that much resentment over a high schooler not throwing her a birthday party almost a decade ago is very unhealthy.", "**NTA** \n\nYou are correct that her anger is displaced. A teenager is not responsible for ensuring her father throws a party for her mother. \n\nDo you think it might make your mother happy if you threw a 60th birthday party for her?", "NTA. Your mom needs to grow up. In my country for example, when it's your birthday, it is YOUR obligation ( if you want to celebrate ) to throw a party, and celebrate with friends/relatives, why tf would someone expect from someone else to throw them a party?", "NTA, it's not your fault your dad didn't throw her a party, that's fully on him.", "NTA. My mother was like this. No one is entitled to someone else\u2019s money being spent on them. And it\u2019s pretty rude AF to demand someone throw you a party. \n\nThat\u2019s the kind of toxic parent you give some\nDistance because it will get in your head forever", "NTA for her 50th party, you were a child. Throwing surprise parties is also not a requirement, if she wishes to have one she can throw one herself, and I'm sure you will happily attend and help out. However, seeing how close she is to her 60th birthday, she might be getting sad thinking that once again, no one will care enough to organise anything. She sounds like she thinks no one notice her, and the party is symbolic of that to her. It's not an obligation for you, but she'd probably be very moved if you were to set up her 60th birthday.", "wow that's really messed up. \n\nyour mom needs a therapist, though I don't imagine she would like to hear that. \n\nat least surface the issue. i.e. next time she brings it up ask her why she is suddenly moving the blame of the sins of your father onto you. \n\nand ask her to explain why she is still so fixated on this one party. obviously it's irrational, so she's going to have to start getting to grips with what exactly her problem actually is and how to resolve it\n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nAny time she brings it up from now on, you should tell her to talk to a therapist about it, you're not interested in talking about it any more, and end the conversation.\n\nDiscussing it with her, leaves it open for debate - you need to disengage from it entirely. No trying to arguing points or how you are innocent or how it is not your fault or trying to prove yourself to her.\n\nYou need to start ending conversations when she brings it up and show her this topic is not going to get a reaction or response or argument.", "NTA. 1.) she\u2019s a grown woman upset over not having a party 9 years ago. 2.) she shouldn\u2019t make you feel guilty or blame you for something like this especially when you were a minor.", "NTA!\n\nYour mom should see a therapist to help her let go of the anger and other issues she keeps hanging onto. It's not healthy for her, and it'll ultimately just push you away especially since no one likes to be on the receiving end of anger they aren't remotely responsibly for. \n\nAnd yes, think of throwing her a 60th birthday party. Don't forget - put it in your calender now. Get other family members involved. Maybe get \\*her\\* involved - ask her what kind of party she'd like, who to invite, lunch or dinner, what kinds of foods. \n\nPS: Don't be the child she confides in. Insist that she sees a therapist, who can also teach her coping tools. We don't know what our parents' marriages were truly like. What your father did (well, didn't do) might well be the tip of the iceberg - and there's decades of anger, sadness, disappointment, etc. You really don't want to go there. Trust me.", "NTA.\nTell her to go get therapy. She obviously needs it.", "NTA.  When someone has a scarring experience, they can either rise above it and move on or they can wallow in it and take on the victim persona.  You mom has chosen the latter and has transferred to you as the perpetrator as your dad is no longer around.  \n\nThis isn't something you can fix, she needs therapy. Sounds like her 60th is coming though...", "NTA  but your relationship with your mom is unhealthy. Tell your mom to never bring up her failded 50th or you will no longer speak to her. Tell her that what happened  happened and no matter what you do it cant change the past and to over herself because she knew what type of person your dad /her husband was.. let her know its not your job to make her happy.  It doesn't sound like she has many friends so having a big party could be a problem.  If you can afford it send her on a cruise - by herself (haha) if she does act up after you talk to her go LC/NC  for a few months.

Here, the birthday person throws a party if they want. Guests are not looked down on, if they bring gifts, in fact most guests would, but it is not exactly a requirement. It seems so unnecessarily helpless just to sit back and wait for someone to make the festivities you want, when you could easily do it yourself. - And she is transferring the anger, she harboured for your father, to you, which is totally unfair.

If she is frustrated with how she allowed herself to be treated in her marriage that had nothing to do with you. \n\nIf she wants a 60th birthday party then she needs to start planning it now.

I\u2019m sorry you married an asshole but I had no say at the time!\u201d It\u2019ll feel like an out of body experience as these difficult words pass through but let them.

Look up emotional incest - the kind of situation you're describing *may* fall into that category if there's a wider pattern of your mum having those kinds of expectations.\n\nYour mum is unhappy, and nothing you do will change that.

You're not responsible for your mum's happiness, and you're not the cause of her unhappiness either. It wasn't your job either to stand up for her when you were younger - she's the parent, you're the child, not the other way round, it was *her* job to look after *you*.\n\nShe sounds narcissistic and immature - don't let her guilt-trip you.

You've done nothing wrong.", "NTA \n\nYou were a senior in HS and not responsible to plan, or able to afford something like that.
