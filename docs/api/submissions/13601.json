My dad dated, but none of them stuck until recently. I do think that I might have been part of the reason in some cases, as I know one was upset that I never \u201cwarmed up\u201d to her. I don\u2019t remember ever treating any of them badly, but I was usually not very interested in them. I feel like I don\u2019t need a mom figure and I am happiest doing my own thing. That\u2019s all for context, because I am trying to understand why everyone is upset and it seems possibly relevant to the current situation. I might be missing a pattern.\n\nMy dad started dating Helen 3 years ago and they married a year ago. Things were difficult at first because it took some time for her to really understand that I do not need mothering and she will not fill that role for me. We finally arrived at a compromise in that she agreed to route all concerns through my dad instead of trying to parent me directly and in return I would spend a reasonable amount of time with her and my dad around schoolwork. That was working well until she became pregnant several months ago. My dad has said that the medical situation is a little stressful, so I might need to be more understanding of Helen than usual for awhile.\n\nHelen seems to be absolutely obsessed with the baby. It\u2019s all that she talks about lately. I don\u2019t have an interest in the subject, but I let her talk. Because I skipped two grades, I am also graduating high school this year and preparing for college, so I have a lot of other things on my mind. The Schrodinger\u2019s AH situation happened this last week at dinner when she was talking about what it\u2019s going to be like once the baby was born. In retrospect, she may have just been looking for validation, but she asked if I was excited about having a baby brother. I\u2019m not, so I said that I wasn\u2019t.\n\nShe asked why and I said that 1) I will be at college by then and very busy, so that will be my focus; 2) I am not fond of babies in general; and 3) Even if siblings were something that I wanted, I do not expect to be involved much with a half sibling that will have a nearly 16 year age difference.\n\nHelen started crying and said that she doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m so cold all the time and she thought that at least I would be happy about the baby and loosen up some. She also asked if it would kill me to show some emotion and concern with how hard this is. My dad stepped in then, but later told me that I really hurt Helen\u2019s feelings and not caring about Helen or the baby is cruel. He said that even if I don\u2019t like Helen, I should not take it out on my soon to be brother by denying him a big sister that loves him.\n\nI don\u2019t really understand the problem to be completely honest and no one here seems to be willing or able to explain. I feel like the answer I gave was reasonable. So, AITA?\n\nEdit: Someone in comments said that I should add the following.  I am not autistic according to professional evaluation.  I do have a birth-related TBI that creates a similar effect on my emotions to some people on the spectrum. I experience few emotions myself and I often have to logically reason out other people\u2019s emotions to understand them and update my mental model of how things work for future reference.", "created_utc": 1680207225, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/126xxks/aita_for_taking_no_interest_in_my_stepmothers/", "score": 141, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My mother\u2019s second husband was an abusive asshole to me. Just physically but still. And I called this man \u2018dad\u2019 from the time I met him (I was six at that time.) Fast forward four years and they\u2019re getting a divorce because I couldn\u2019t take it anymore and my mom saw that. I asked her if I had to call her new guy \u2018dad\u2019 and she said not if I didn\u2019t want to. And I didn\u2019t until I was 23 (I\u2019m 35 now). But that man earned it, and I\u2019m glad he never gave up on me, but he didn\u2019t force me to accept him as my father, but he did expect me to respect him as a figure in my life, which I understood and did. \n\nAnd I also have experience of marrying a man with children. My ex husband\u2019s daughter was about your age when he and I met and moved in with each other. I made it known from the get go that I didn\u2019t expect her to call me \u2018mom\u2019 or even see me that way. She has her own mother, but I would be there if she needed anything or someone to talk to. She was very receptive to that and we had a decent relationship until her father and I divorced. \n\nNow, I know that there wasn\u2019t a new baby thrown in there, but from your post you seem very well adjusted, which makes me think you have a maternal figure in some capacity (grandma, aunt, best friends mom, what have you). You also come across as respectful, even though it wasn\u2019t what your father\u2019s wife wanted to hear. \n\nMaybe tell your father that you\u2019re not thinking about being a big sister since you\u2019re pretty much starting your life already. But this isn\u2019t to say that you can\u2019t or won\u2019t be a big sister later on, if you felt that\u2019s something you wanted to do. You\u2019re just not interested right now, and you shouldn\u2019t be made to feel shame about that. It\u2019s not your pregnancy. \n\nCongratulations on graduating early, though!!

I think how you expressed it came off as offensive.\n\nYou don't have to be excited to have a baby brother, but I feel like the things you said can definitely be hurtful.

In this situation, Helen was super excited to talk about your future sibling and it's really clear she is happy and excited for this. She tried to involve you in the excitement, and you basically said, \"your future child means nothing to me.\"\n\nObviously, this is going to upset her! She's clearly excited about having a kid, and you sort of shit all over her. Again, you don't have to be bursting with excitement, but I feel like you said hurtful things and are now trying to justify it by basically saying, \"I was just being honest.\" That's something assholes say all the time, right after they say offensive shit! lol. The things you said are absolutely cold/potentially rude remarks, and you don't get a free pass for saying them just because \"honesty.\"\n\nIt would be like if you talked to Helen about something you are excited about. Like, I don't know, school or college and how excited you are to start soon. And then she turned around and said, \"Well, I'll have a baby to raise and I've already been to college so I don't see what the fuss is.\"\n\nIs the statement honest? More or less. Is it offensive? YES! Remarks like this are really dismissive of others. It shifts the attention away from the thing the person is excited about, and makes this thing seem unimportant or insignificant. This can be really hurtful to the person who is excited about whatever they're excited about. People tell people things they're excited about to share that enthusiasm, not to be reminded that the things that excite them don't matter to other people.

It took me a lot longer then 4 years to recognize and accept that difference and to  stop expecting a response similar to what I would give and recognize the difference is not personal. Being excited for a new change is common.  It is common to want to share that excitement especially within the household/family.

You're not *withholding emotions to punish them*, they just *aren't there.* The closest you're going to get is using your cognitive empathy as you have been to figure out logically how to respond to emotional cues from others.", "NTA. \n\nAs both a therapist and someone who does not get a rat's butt about babies, there's no reason to lie. It also sounds like maybe this has been brewing for a while for Helen, and she let it all out now, especially with the, \"loosen up a bit,\" comment. \n\nIf you're going to college, you're really not going to be around, and, honestly, unless you're a baby/kid person, why would you be excited? \nIf Helen asked \"are you happy about the baby?\" saying, \"I'm happy you're happy!\" might be a better answer than, \"Not really.\" \n\nRe: kindness, look into the difference [between nice and kind](https://www.scu.edu/the-big-q/being-nice-vs-being-kind/). Helen was expecting you to be nice, whereas you were kind. You set your own boundaries, and were true to yourself in a way that was also respectful of Helen. If you had said yes, it would have disappointed both of them later.", "I think that\u2019s a huge part of it - just because something wasn\u2019t explicitly unkind does not mean it was kind. \n\nAnd I don\u2019t mean to sound too harsh, but just because you don\u2019t find the conversation or relationship meaningful, doesn\u2019t mean the other person doesn\u2019t. It can\u2019t always be about who and what you want or find important. If you\u2019re to have a functional relationship with people, especially family, there has to be more empathy and understanding that sometimes what matters to others may be completely uninteresting or unimportant to you - that doesn\u2019t mean you get to stop participating. Because that\u2019s pretty selfish.\n\nETA: have you heard of the saying \u2018indifference is worse that hate\u2019? Because I think that\u2019s likely what Helen was feeling", "I would be careful your still young i dont know what might happen with the new kid but lets hope your stepmom isnt vindictive and try to get your dad to stop helping you when your in university.", "I\u2019m sure you\u2019re a great kid, OP and I\u2019m not trying to suggest otherwise. The point I\u2019m making is those are very restrictive boundaries and I don\u2019t know many adults who would agree to them. I certainly wouldn\u2019t. I wouldn\u2019t have a problem or having parenting privileges but I wouldn\u2019t be ok with having to go through a third party to communicate my feelings or opinions to someone who lives in a home that I\u2019m helping to maintain by either paying bills or running the household or both. I\u2019m not trying to insult your boundaries. I\u2019m just saying that Helen is abiding by these restrictive boundaries, you should at least be more considerate and sensitive when you\u2019re talking to her.", "Yup.  That \"efficiency of a working system\" is classic.  Read some books on people who have Asperger's.  It will help you make more sense of how you engage in the world around you so that your working system becomes more effective under a broader range of circumstances such as you are going to encounter as you get to college. Best of luck.  I have confidence you will sort all this out.", "Comment straight out of r/RomanticAdvice", "The neuropsychologist I see told me that it\u2019s very difficult for neurotypical for people to understand my condition because it\u2019s like emotional blindness. It\u2019s hard to explain a poem about the color of daffodils to someone who was born blind and has never seen a color. There\u2019s a deaf boy at my school and people talk loudly at him even though they know that he is deaf and can\u2019t hear them.  Maybe Helen is like those people.  She knows in her mind that I don\u2019t experience emotions, but there\u2019s a part of her tells her that she just needs to emote louder. That\u2019s my theory after reading the comments.", "Did you see the comment where OP explains they have a TBI that has impacted their brain development and specifically emotions? Her father and certainly her stepmother should be fully aware of these things and not expect something she is not capable of giving them.  \n\nIt seems really unreasonable they are expecting OP to magically change how her brain functions just because they have a major life event happening.", "Fair enough. I do experience more or less complete indifference towards Helen, so that may be a correct assessment on her part.  I don\u2019t know that I agree with that being worse than hate, as I find indifference to be a comfortable baseline with the majority of people, but perhaps it\u2019s different for her.  I don\u2019t believe my indifference towards Helen is likely to change, however.  I don\u2019t consider her family and I have a weak association with the concept of family to begin with.", "Or Helen could actually make an effort to get used to the way OP communicates after 3 years.", "It sounds like OP doesn't need Helen, full stop. Just because dad wants to get some on the regular doesn't mean authority is ceded to Helen.", "I see it now. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair for them to expect her to feel emotions she\u2019s incapable of having obviously. But I also don\u2019t think it\u2019s out of the question for her to phrase her answer as \u201cI\u2019m happy you\u2019re happy\u201d instead. Especially considering OP mentions having worked on training to pick up on social queues and situational norms.", "I understand where you\u2019re coming from, but I\u2019m sure it is different for her. She probably hopes, and to a certain extent expects, that she wouldn\u2019t be treated like a majority of the people you come across. \n\nEven if your indifference doesn\u2019t change, I think it\u2019s important, and would be beneficial for your relationships, to change how obviously you express that. You don\u2019t have to be best friends, or put her comfort before yours, but perhaps refrain from offering information like you have no intention of being involved in your sibling\u2019s life.", "I think Helen has been very accommodating. Consideration and sensitivity is not a lot to ask. OP is going to have a hard time getting to where she wants to be in life is she thinks that everyone has to adjust to her and she doesn\u2019t have to meet them halfway.", "They\u2019re married. She\u2019s not his mistress. Usually when a couple gets married and one or both of them have minor children, the spouse will help take care of and raise the kids. It\u2019s not abnormal.", "Yeah I just think it would be best for them to talk to her and or her neuropsychologist about what happened and perhaps get her further training on recognizing emotional and social skills.  \n\nAt the end of a day she is still a minor and they are responsible for her upbringing and her current development \u2026 and unless they see this as a sign she needs more training on social interactions it will really negatively impact her in the future as well as the people around her whose feelings are hurt.", "Or she will naturally just weed out overbearing and oversensative people like Helen.", "They got married when op was a junior in high school, at that point there should be little to no parental authority given to the step parent."]}
