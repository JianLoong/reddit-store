A few months ago, we decided to just chill at home on Valentine\u2019s and on the day of our anniversary visit a famous burger restaurant nearby, we haven\u2019t been there yet because it\u2019s expensive and we are both students still. \n\nHowever, 3 days ago I was doing some stuff on the internet and found a (in my country popular) website that offers coupons for from helicopter rides, winetasting etc. to 3 - 7 days long stays in hotels with wellness etc. I looked for a bit and found some great offers, sent it to my bf and ultimately we agreed to book a hotel stay instead of the expensive restaurant. It\u2019s for 3 days, unlimited pool and sauna time and all inclusive and it\u2019s affordable for us. It also stated that if one of the days you book the stay for is Feb 14th, you will get a back massage for two and a bottle of champaigne for free. We decided to book it for 13th - 15th. \n\nYesterday, my friend of 10+ years (20F) told me she broke up with her boyfriend. We\u2019ve been talking a lot and got good food, I comforted her etc and then she told me we should do something together on Valentine\u2019s since she\u2019s alone. I told her that I\u2019m sorry but I\u2019ve already purchased a hotel stay with my bf and it\u2019s also for our anniversary so I won\u2019t bail on it and Valentine\u2019s itself isn\u2019t such a big deal. She got a bit mad and started saying that I\u2019m insensitive, we should go clubbing and drinking and I should just move the stay. The thing is that there\u2019s additional fee if you want to rearrange the time of your stay less than 7 days before you\u2019re supposed to be there. \n\nShe proceeded to in my opinion guilttrip me and in the end I got annoyed and told her that I\u2019m not responsible for her relationship and that I\u2019m sorry but I knew it\u2019s gonna happen sooner or later and that she chose to ignore me trying to help her get out of her insanely toxic relationship and kept being naive. (Her bf cheated on her and lied to her multiple times since the beginning of their relationship, some time ago told her he had another gf the whole time but apparently he broke up with her and my friend still stayed with him. Also switched schools to go into the same school as him even tho it\u2019s a school focused on subjects she doesn\u2019t find interesting. I told her multiple times to please open her eyes and leave him but she refused to. He dumped her for another woman in the end.) She then proceeded to curse at me and left my house crying and is now not talking to me. \n\nHave I said too much or was I insensitive? I feel like she genuinely is annoying me lately with her naivity and refusing to accept help so I may have snapped.", "created_utc": 1676020313, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10ym281/aita_for_refusing_to_spend_valentines_with_my/", "score": 49, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The fact that she expected you to give up your Valentines Day plans because she did after a break up is extremely entitled and emotionally selfish. What about your existing relationship? What about your happiness? What about your Valentines Day plans? She don't care. I'm not saying stop being friends with her, but if I were you I would seriously reconsider the 10 year plus connection ya'll have. Because her reaction was hurtful and toxic as hell.", "NTA \n\nYou had plans and her expecting you to change them is bad of her.\n\nIt was a bit mean of you to say basically \"I told you so and because you didn't listen you don't deserve sympathy\". I understand why you said that, she was acting entitled to your time because of her relationship ending. Still, it would have been better to say \"I said no, I am not changing my booking, I'm getting angry at your lack of respect of my plans\".", "NTA. Why should you ditch your bf because she is now single? Enjoy your holiday.", "NTA. She's being selfish. She wants you to bail on your relationship because she's single. That's uncool, and to try and guilt you and say your insensitive for not soing so is also not cool.", "NTA\n\nYour friend is totally out of line for expecting you to cancel plans for her, especially with it being an anniversary trip and meaning you'd have to pay money to cancel it.", "NTA you made plans, just because she doesn't have any for that day doesn't mean you need to drop yours to accommodate her. Would you even want to go out clubbing on a normal night? She must have other friends who are single to hang out with if she really has to go out on the 14th, if not there's nothing wrong with staying home in pajamas and watching a favourite movie and ordering in food. Either way, not your problem.", "NTA\n\nYou have plans, and intend to keep them. It's selfish of your friend that, just because she had a breakup, you should be obligated to spend Valentine's Day with her, ESPECIALLY if told her that this was also for your anniversary. Enjoy your holiday, and let her be pissed", "Nope, NTA.\n\n\nNo true friend would ask you to spend Vday with you, knowing you got o boyfriend, let alone ask you to change prepaid plans.\n\n\n\nYou were sensitive to her suffering, she just wants to not be miserable alone, so ruining a day with your boyfriend is good enough for her.", "Sometimes after repeatedly telling someone something they refuse to listen. To think that you should give up your plans is ridiculous, no matter what their relationship was like. She sounds selfish to even suggest it.\n\nNTA", "Well not and AH for going on a trip with your BF but a bit insensitive for rubbing her mistakes into her face.\n\nEven thought it may be true and she is naiv , nobody want to be attacked by their friend like that.\n\nSounds to me like you were fed up and throw everything at her. She should know that Vday is for couples and you should simple asked her if she would ditch her bf on Vday if you broke up with your bf . I guess that's the logic she would understand .  You don't need to stop your life just to be seen as a good friend.", "NTA --- Your friend can't be all that heartbroken if she wants the 2 of you to go out clubbing and drinking.", "NTA. She shouldn\u2019t expect you to drop all your plans for her. Especially after you warned her about the ex so many times too and she didn\u2019t listen. I get that she needs a friend but she\u2019s in the wrong for how she reacted.", "NTA\n\n\nSo essentially she wants you to ditch your BF and go out like your single.\n\n\nBet anything she would love for you to end your relationship so she won't be single alone.", "ESH - Your friend was overstepping by insisting you cancel plans you already paid for and lose out on extra money to change it plus the bonuses for the Valentine\u2019s booking (massage and champagne). I get that she\u2019s focused on her pain but it\u2019s disrespectful to expect friends to drop everything important to them for a non emergency. She was being an AH for trying to guilt you. \n\nHowever you didn\u2019t need to attack her like you did and blame her for everything that\u2019s happening to her. Yeah she should have left the guy ages ago but people in toxic relationships can\u2019t always see reason and logic because their abuser is constantly rewriting the narrative and it\u2019s extremely confusing. It would have been better to just stay firm with a, \u201cNo!\u201d to her pleas and just let her be mad about that. Now she\u2019s mad at you and hurt by you at the same time. Pretty AH move to a friend. \n\nHopefully you can talk it out with her once she calms down. You both said things you shouldn\u2019t and it should be a joint apology. If she can\u2019t see where she was wrong in the situation then maybe you guys are not very good friends and you should let her go.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
