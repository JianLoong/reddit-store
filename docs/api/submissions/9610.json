A few months ago, we decided to just chill at home on Valentine\u2019s and on the day of our anniversary visit a famous burger restaurant nearby, we haven\u2019t been there yet because it\u2019s expensive and we are both students still. \n\nHowever, 3 days ago I was doing some stuff on the internet and found a (in my country popular) website that offers coupons for from helicopter rides, winetasting etc. to 3 - 7 days long stays in hotels with wellness etc. I looked for a bit and found some great offers, sent it to my bf and ultimately we agreed to book a hotel stay instead of the expensive restaurant. It\u2019s for 3 days, unlimited pool and sauna time and all inclusive and it\u2019s affordable for us. It also stated that if one of the days you book the stay for is Feb 14th, you will get a back massage for two and a bottle of champaigne for free. We decided to book it for 13th - 15th. \n\nYesterday, my friend of 10+ years (20F) told me she broke up with her boyfriend. We\u2019ve been talking a lot and got good food, I comforted her etc and then she told me we should do something together on Valentine\u2019s since she\u2019s alone. I told her that I\u2019m sorry but I\u2019ve already purchased a hotel stay with my bf and it\u2019s also for our anniversary so I won\u2019t bail on it and Valentine\u2019s itself isn\u2019t such a big deal. She got a bit mad and started saying that I\u2019m insensitive, we should go clubbing and drinking and I should just move the stay. The thing is that there\u2019s additional fee if you want to rearrange the time of your stay less than 7 days before you\u2019re supposed to be there. \n\nShe proceeded to in my opinion guilttrip me and in the end I got annoyed and told her that I\u2019m not responsible for her relationship and that I\u2019m sorry but I knew it\u2019s gonna happen sooner or later and that she chose to ignore me trying to help her get out of her insanely toxic relationship and kept being naive. (Her bf cheated on her and lied to her multiple times since the beginning of their relationship, some time ago told her he had another gf the whole time but apparently he broke up with her and my friend still stayed with him. Also switched schools to go into the same school as him even tho it\u2019s a school focused on subjects she doesn\u2019t find interesting. I told her multiple times to please open her eyes and leave him but she refused to. He dumped her for another woman in the end.) She then proceeded to curse at me and left my house crying and is now not talking to me. \n\nHave I said too much or was I insensitive? I feel like she genuinely is annoying me lately with her naivity and refusing to accept help so I may have snapped.", "created_utc": 1676020313, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10ym281/aita_for_refusing_to_spend_valentines_with_my/", "score": 628, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The fact that she expected you to give up your Valentines Day plans because she did after a break up is extremely entitled and emotionally selfish. What about your existing relationship? What about your happiness? What about your Valentines Day plans? She don't care. I'm not saying stop being friends with her, but if I were you I would seriously reconsider the 10 year plus connection ya'll have. Because her reaction was hurtful and toxic as hell.", "NTA \n\nYou had plans and her expecting you to change them is bad of her.\n\nIt was a bit mean of you to say basically \"I told you so and because you didn't listen you don't deserve sympathy\". I understand why you said that, she was acting entitled to your time because of her relationship ending. Still, it would have been better to say \"I said no, I am not changing my booking, I'm getting angry at your lack of respect of my plans\".", "NTA. Why should you ditch your bf because she is now single? Enjoy your holiday.", "NTA. She's being selfish. She wants you to bail on your relationship because she's single. That's uncool, and to try and guilt you and say your insensitive for not soing so is also not cool.", "NTA\n\nYour friend is totally out of line for expecting you to cancel plans for her, especially with it being an anniversary trip and meaning you'd have to pay money to cancel it.", "NTA you made plans, just because she doesn't have any for that day doesn't mean you need to drop yours to accommodate her. Would you even want to go out clubbing on a normal night? She must have other friends who are single to hang out with if she really has to go out on the 14th, if not there's nothing wrong with staying home in pajamas and watching a favourite movie and ordering in food. Either way, not your problem.", "NTA\n\nYou have plans, and intend to keep them. It's selfish of your friend that, just because she had a breakup, you should be obligated to spend Valentine's Day with her, ESPECIALLY if told her that this was also for your anniversary. Enjoy your holiday, and let her be pissed", "Nope, NTA.\n\n\nNo true friend would ask you to spend Vday with you, knowing you got o boyfriend, let alone ask you to change prepaid plans.\n\n\n\nYou were sensitive to her suffering, she just wants to not be miserable alone, so ruining a day with your boyfriend is good enough for her.", "Sometimes after repeatedly telling someone something they refuse to listen. To think that you should give up your plans is ridiculous, no matter what their relationship was like. She sounds selfish to even suggest it.\n\nNTA", "Well not and AH for going on a trip with your BF but a bit insensitive for rubbing her mistakes into her face.\n\nEven thought it may be true and she is naiv , nobody want to be attacked by their friend like that.\n\nSounds to me like you were fed up and throw everything at her. She should know that Vday is for couples and you should simple asked her if she would ditch her bf on Vday if you broke up with your bf . I guess that's the logic she would understand .  You don't need to stop your life just to be seen as a good friend.", "NTA --- Your friend can't be all that heartbroken if she wants the 2 of you to go out clubbing and drinking.", "NTA. She shouldn\u2019t expect you to drop all your plans for her. Especially after you warned her about the ex so many times too and she didn\u2019t listen. I get that she needs a friend but she\u2019s in the wrong for how she reacted.", "NTA\n\n\nSo essentially she wants you to ditch your BF and go out like your single.\n\n\nBet anything she would love for you to end your relationship so she won't be single alone.", "ESH - Your friend was overstepping by insisting you cancel plans you already paid for and lose out on extra money to change it plus the bonuses for the Valentine\u2019s booking (massage and champagne). I get that she\u2019s focused on her pain but it\u2019s disrespectful to expect friends to drop everything important to them for a non emergency. She was being an AH for trying to guilt you. \n\nHowever you didn\u2019t need to attack her like you did and blame her for everything that\u2019s happening to her. Yeah she should have left the guy ages ago but people in toxic relationships can\u2019t always see reason and logic because their abuser is constantly rewriting the narrative and it\u2019s extremely confusing. It would have been better to just stay firm with a, \u201cNo!\u201d to her pleas and just let her be mad about that. Now she\u2019s mad at you and hurt by you at the same time. Pretty AH move to a friend. \n\nHopefully you can talk it out with her once she calms down. You both said things you shouldn\u2019t and it should be a joint apology. If she can\u2019t see where she was wrong in the situation then maybe you guys are not very good friends and you should let her go.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If something serious happen, OP should stay (I'm not giving ideas here), but for drowning her sorrow, nothing should change. OP did console her, it should have been enough. If she would really want to drown her sorrow with OP, do it before or after the planned event.", "I don't agree with this, she sounds selfish and it's a good thing you gave it to her straight.", "Thank you for your opinion!

But something I learned from Harry Potter: it is easy to forgive people for being wrong; it can be extremely hard to forgive people for being right. I dont know anything about your friendship with this girl, but if you want her in your life still, keep in mind that it's never helpful to point out you were right the whole time while your friend is \"grieving\". Give her some time and support before you rub it in.", ">was I insensitive? \n\nPossibly.  But if you were, I'd leave it until after you are back from your trip to reach out.  Any reaching out you do now will only result in her expecting you to spend Valentine's Day with her.\n\nESH.  \n\nBut you are only a little bit of an ass in that no one needs to hear \"I told you so\" just after they have broken up.  \n\nHer expecting you to arrange your life around her needs without any consideration of your needs makes her a major ass.", "NTA. But I'd reconsider this friendship. My friends are not obligated to like my wife (as hers aren't obligated to like me) But they all know that asking me to choose them over her is a deal breaker.", "it is not Galentine\u2019s day. NTA.", "ESH. Your friend sucks more than you, but you also suck here. It\u2019s incredibly selfish to demand you move your anniversary plans, but it\u2019s also cruel of you to tell your friend of 10+ years they had it coming and I told you so right after an emotional breakup.", "NTA. Don't even try to talk to her before VD. Focus on your relationship and then let her cool off.", "NTA - she was unrealistic expecting you to dump your own boyfriend from an arranged holiday and take her clubbing because her relationship was broken. And sounds like it was badly broken a long time before the final split. Don't let her put your's at risk so you are available as her wingwoman. Really hope you have a great stay. \n\nYou are not her property or emotional support human, especially if she only wants your advice when it suits her. I suspect she isn't as naive as you think but finds drama a good way to get sympathy and support from people and control them at the same time.  Her BF seems to have been pretty honest with her and she still chased him.", "NTA, her lovelife or lack thereof is not your problem.", "Why would she assume someone in a relationship would dump their Valentine plans to spend the day guy bashing (yes that would happen)?\n\nEnjoy your vacation. She\u2019s responsible for her own life. NTA", "Your \"friend\" is a lunatic. You need to stand up for yourself. Don't even argue about it, just say \"No.\" and have fun on your trip.

I feel really angry about this and if you keep this up I'm not going to be talking to you for as long as it takes to properly calm down. It might take at least a week at this stage\".\n\nI do tend to get quite irrate when someone ignores me saying no though and so fury would be infusing my tone.", "Nta .

You ultimately came through for yourself but please don't ever think that you should put yourself last because someone else is having a tantrum. NTA", "NTA. If I were you, I might consider if she\u2019s the sort of friend where she expects support but doesn\u2019t offer any herself, or if any \u201ccompromise\u201d between the two of you is actually you doing things her way. People who demand support and refuse it if it isn\u2019t exactly how they want it tend to be bad overall friends.", "NTA. That's not the reaction of a friend. I would reconsider my relationship with someone who cares so little about you. She seems narcissistic.", "NTA. She was wrong to get angry that you would not cancel your plans. You might not have needed to go into detail, but she did keep pushing you. It  is interesting that she tries to push you around but tolerates this really nasty asshole bf.

You are more than allowed to enjoy your life (and vacation) without being guilted out of it by your \"friend\".

Go enjoy your trip", "ESH", "Well, you could've left out the part of \"I knew it was going to happen\", but I fully understand your frustration. Your friend was being selfish, expecting you to go with whatever plan she makes. It's like she wants your relationship with her to be as toxic as the relationship she had with her exbf.\n\nNTA, not at all. You don't need friends like her.", "Right? What friend would expect this? A friend would reschedule and have a girls night sometime when it's appropriate. \n\nI broke up with a long term (8years)ex just before Valentines. I knew I had to do the heavy lifting and get myself to be strong. Was I sad, alone and depressed? Yes. Did I expect everyone to drop their life for me? No. \n\nI didn't even tell my friend about it until the love season was over. It just brings this impending doom that is hard to get rid of. Why would anybody do this to their friend? Makes no sense.", "NTA\n\nBut maybe rethink this friendship.\n\nShe did a LOT to be close to and pursue an obviously toxic guy and when he finally left her, she's trying to manipulate you into being in charge of her emotions. \n\nIt sounds like she's got a few issues she needs to sort out herself. \n\nEnjoy your Valentines day and maybe mute this friend (or go no phones/screens) during that time to avoid any drama she might try.", "NTA. You're prioritizing your life, your friend is mad that she's not the center of your life. Heck maybe she's mad you're in a healthy steady relationship. It's not your fault her relationship ended and it's not your job to be her only support.", "NTA she was basically saying I got dumped so I want you to act like you were too rather than celebrating you relationship", "NTA And though I feel for your friend, I also want to warn you. Being in a toxic situation for long makes people normalize toxic behavior, and therefor they might themselves repeat it. \n\nIt's good for your friend that you are willing to care for and support her while she is hurting. But as you do so: this is very much a time where you need to be extra careful with your own boundaries towards her, because she is completely used to having her own boundaries stomped and might challenge yours without realizing it. \n\nNow, I wasn't there, so I can't know for sure, but it looks like she was trying to transfer her old codependency from her ex to you, and the toxicity of that situation could well be what made you snap. So please don't be too hard on yourself for what you said even though you clearly didn't like making your friend cry. \n\nShe is probably swimming in her own pool of self hatred and -blame (I remember it well from my own experience with such a relationship) and most likely took your words so hard because she ageees but can't deal with it all at once.", "NTA. Your friend can have a pity party on her own. Go out with your BF and celebrate Valentine's Day/Early 2 year anniversary.", "NTA doesn't sound like she's a good friend that actually considers your feelings.", "NTA.\n\nI had a break up right before Valentine\u2019s Day once and it sucked. Like really sucked. But I definitely didn\u2019t expect my friends in relationships to give up their plans for me, that\u2019s an insane demand. I bought myself some wine and ice cream and watched some thriller movies and avoided the day.", "NTA. Your friend is a selfish entitled child for wanting to disrupt your relationship just because hers ended.", "Look back at your 10+ years of being friends.....how many times did she use you as an emotional crutch versus you with her? \n\nJust because you've been friends forever, doesn't mean you have to be friends forever. \n\nI once had a friend like yours, and then one day I woke up to the fact that their life was nothing but drama for her and I didn't want to be apart of it.", "NTA.

You were there comforting her but that doesn't give her the right to expect you to move the dates from your vacation. Go on that trip have fun.", "There\u2019s just no helping some ppl. Your friend is one of those ppl. With friends like her you don\u2019t need enemies. She\u2019s an oxygen thief and a waste of your time.", "NTA.  Your friend is acting quite entitled, entitled to losing the description of friend.", "NTA  \n\n\nAt first I thought maybe you were too harsh. I have a friend who went from toxic relationship to toxic relationship. To the point her last husband fractured her skull. Sad and shocking, right? No, she's spent the last 25 YEARS with guys who beat her. I got stuck with endless trips to the ER, cops, and to court.   \n\n\nYour friend has serious self esteem issues.  \nHer problems WILL ALWAYS become YOUR problems.   \n\n\nWhat you did was unkind, but IMO necessary.", "That's all very well but trying to deliver such a response when you're reacting emotionally (understandably) to being guilt tripped by a so-called friend is quite tricky.", " I would cool things off for a little while (especially the length of the trip).", "I won\u2019t be cancelling plans, hopefully she will answer my messages.", "NTA, but just barely. \n\nI\u2019ll give her a little leeway because she was grieving, but she was a jerk for expecting you and your boyfriend to change plans just for her. If she had left it as just asking, I wouldn\u2019t even call her a jerk. But that she pushed and tried to guilt trip you just moved her solidly into jerk territory. Again, I\u2019m giving her some leeway. \n\nYou shouldn\u2019t have dumped all of that on her, but I get why you did. You were frustrated by her lack of respecting boundaries. But you also rubbed salt into her wounds. \n\nI hope you and your boyfriend have a wonderful trip!", "ESH.  Your friend was being selfish to want you to change all your plans.
