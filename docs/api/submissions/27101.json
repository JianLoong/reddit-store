You didn't know it was a secret, and why is she keeping it from her husband if she didn't think it was wrong. Your mom is responsible for her own actions here. \n\nShe has to want to do something for herself, that doesn't compromise others against their wishes, or that may seem like more effort to her. Only she can put that effort in. Your parents marriage might be in trouble if she doesn't, but that's all on her.", "Show your Mom this thread, since she's so big on social media! If she feels unfulfilled, she should get a job or volunteer somewhere. I see this ending badly for your whole family. Children are NOT PROPS.\n\nYour Dad being a lawyer, he will hopefully give her an earful about the concept of \"consent\" when he comes back from work. Children under the age of 18 cannot consent; their parents do it for them. Note the plural! Your mom cannot unilaterally take away your siblings' consent by saying they are \\*her\\* children; Dad gets his say. So do your siblings, for that matter, and you should tell them.

Does it make your or their life better or worse to keep this \"secret\"???\n\nIf friend A gets a new haircut, and friend B admits to you she doesn't like it, but you know Friend A LOVES her new haircut, can you keep it a \"secret\" that friend B doesn't like it?\n\nWho does that secret help or hurt?\n\nIf friend A admits to you that friend B didn't have anything to eat for lunch yesterday, can you tell your parents and have them give you extra lunch so you can offer friend B your extra?\n\nDoes sharing that secret \"hurt\" anyone?  or Help?\n\nSo starting with a simple difference between Happy Surprises or Sad Secrets, can build into a more nuanced discussion of helping or hurting, without having to tear down and completely re-formulate their mental framework on Secrets.", "I really like this. Expanding on the discussion of what constitutes a secret in an age appropriate way that builds on other positive qualities like compassion and empathy while cautioning about negative qualities that lead to little more than hurt feelings."]}
