You did well in discussing with your father the behavior of your mother that bothers you, specifically, her uploading videos of you (or your siblings) to her social media accounts.

The embarrassing stuff, the bad stuff, right alongside anything positive. These videos if left alone can result in decades of having to relive those possibly painful or embarrassing moments because someone just saw it recently, or wants to bring it back up. It will haunt them, and can haunt them, literally their entire life.
