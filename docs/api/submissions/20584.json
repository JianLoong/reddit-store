I have two bio siblings ages 14m and 13f. And I have four stepsiblings ages 19f, 14m, 14m and 12f. Mine and my brother's mom died when I was 5. Oldest stepsibling never knew her father. My other three stepsiblings dad still plays a role in their lives but was never big on the oldest and eventually my stepmom left him for that reason.\n\nMy siblings call stepmom mom since they only know her as mom, oldest stepsister calls dad that because she never had one and he was willing, younger three call him that because they are not fond of their bio father. But I have never called my stepmom mom. I was only 5 when dad and her moved in together (5 months after my mom died). She's okay. But to me I do not love her like that and I do not want her to be my mom. I have some memories of my mom and find it disrespectful. She's told me before it's never disrespectful and if I had a baby one day, wouldn't I want them to never be without a mom, I told them they'd always have a mom whether I'm dead or alive and I wouldn't want them calling someone else mom. She told me I was too young to get it so I should just follow the flow of the household and start calling her mom.\n\nMy dad and stepmom went to a meeting with my school about my IEP and there it was brought up that she was my stepmom because I tell teachers at school and my aid. Always did. But I guess it was brought up for some reason and they hated it. So they sat me down and said if I won't call her mom, then they will try to accept it, though they think she has earned that title after all these years, but they said at least stop saying dad and stepmom and start saying parents. I told them no. That when I say parents I mean my mom and dad. Not dad and stepmom.\n\nDad told me I was being a difficult little shit and why do I insist on punishing my stepmom for mom's death. I said it's not punishing her. It's doing what feels right to me. Just like the other kids do what feels right to them. He told me he doesn't give a shit about what I feel is right. THEY say what is right as an adult.\n\nStepmom said my unwillingness to work with them and compromise drives her crazy.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1687727984, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14ixnyq/aita_for_refusing_to_compromise_with_my_dad_and/", "score": 175, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They should be happy you are honest with them about your feelings.", "NTA- No stepparent has the right to demand a title from you.  That's earned.  I love my father's wife, but they married after I was grown and I've never lived with them.  She's never been any kind of mother to me.  I just call her by her first name and we're cool.  My little brother was still a preteen when they got married, and he calls her step-mom even though he lived with them full time.  She's fine with that too.\n\nI also have to ask, since you mentioned IEP, are you on the autistic spectrum?  If so, they should know that many people who have autism fine it very hard to say something they feel is untruthful.  You don't feel like she's your mom, therefore calling her your mom is an untruth and why would you lie to people?\n\nShe has the right to have hurt feelings if she has raised you and treated you the same as her other children.  But hurt feelings still don't give her the right to tell you to lie.  Her feelings are not more important than your feelings, and as the adult she should understand that.", "NTA. You already have a mother. The fact that she's not living doesn't mean someone else can take her place. It's wild to me that anyone thinks this would be an okay thing to insist on even once, much less repeatedly. It's absolutely horrible that your dad called you a \"little shit\" over it. He and your stepmom are beyond belief for pressuring you on this.", "How is calling her mom a compromise on their part? You can't force what you don't feel, so why lie about it? No one has the right to dictate your feelings. \n\nNTA, but your father is. Would he be okay with someone replacing him ?", "NTA - are you in contact with your mom's family? Can they help you? I'd tell the school counsellor everything, including the name calling. I'd also plan on moving out ASAP", "NTA - It amazes me about how many Reddit posts are about this issue. Why the hell are the parents-step parents forcing the child to call them mom or dad. Crazy!\n\nIn your case, your SM moved in 5 months after your bio mother died. Even though you were very young, you still remembered your mom and having SM thrust into your life had to be a shock. You were not so young, that you didn\u2019t miss your mom & grieve for her. \n\nYour father and SM need to respect your decision and stop shoving it down your throat-it\u2019s been 11 years. Enough already.", "NTA\n\nYour father and stepmother are behaving like spoilt children. \n\nI think it's always a bit sad when a child  acts in a more emotionally mature way than the adults around them.\n\nThey should accept and respect your decision. Not attempt to bully you into submission. That is NOT what a good parent would do.", "You're not punishing anyone; she's trying to appropriate something that isn't hers.

Only you do.", "NTA- it DOES matter what you feel as right and you shouldn\u2019t be forced to call anyone mom you don\u2019t want to.

They are being idiots.", "NTA\n\nThis is a them problem and one they need to get over. You have made your position perfectly clear and appear to have done so in a respectful and adult manner.\n\nI'd tell them they are about to lose being recognized as step mom and she will just be referred to as dad's wife and dad is getting close to just being sperm donor.", "NTA do what you feel is right", "NTA NTA NTA. Don't let anyone tell you that you have to call her mom. If you're comfortable with it, do it. I'd not, don't. My stepdad was my stepdad. My dad was my dad. My stepdad sometimes referred to me as his daughter, which I was fine with. He was comfortable with calling me that. I was his stepdaughter for 30 years, and he didn't have any biological daughters.

BUT only if YOU want it. At this time, you do not. And that is fine. But I agree that most mothers want what's best for their child. And if you had a stepmom that you loved very much, and you wanted to call her mom, your real mom would be more than happy for you.\n\nThe fact stepmom wants to force you to call her mom, makes her a bad stepmom. It really is that easy. \n\nIt is like saying 'I demand you will love me' \nIt will never ever work.", "NTA. My new mantra on AITA posts about blended families is: Real life blended families are not the Brady Bunch. Relationships cannot be forced. \n\nBecause of family dynamics I introduced my mother and step dad as my parents but alway called him by his first name.  But he was my parent too. However, my father and his second wife were introduced as my father and his wife.  Because she wasn't my parent. She tried to force it and I wouldn't let her. She was his affair partner too. I actually told her once she played a part in breaking up their marriage and I would never consider her as a parental figure.  She got the message after that.", "NTA - A couple of things. First, with you being 16, you should be attending ALL of your meetings about your IEP. When you turn 18, you'll be your own legal guardian and responsible for signing and understanding what is written in your IEP. I have no idea why it would be brought up that you call your step mom your step mom at your IEP, but moving forward I would insist that you be at ALL meetings. The last thing you want is her being listed as your mom in that document. Second, no one can force you to call them mom or dad. Those titles are earned.", "Give your dad a choice.\n\nYou can call him father, and your stepmother can be called stepmother.\n\nOr in 2 years when you're 18, you won't call them at all.", "YTA - parent is a great compromise because she does parent you and has done so for a decade+\n\nIt\u2019s not just about how you feel.
