I have two bio siblings ages 14m and 13f. And I have four stepsiblings ages 19f, 14m, 14m and 12f. Mine and my brother's mom died when I was 5. Oldest stepsibling never knew her father. My other three stepsiblings dad still plays a role in their lives but was never big on the oldest and eventually my stepmom left him for that reason.\n\nMy siblings call stepmom mom since they only know her as mom, oldest stepsister calls dad that because she never had one and he was willing, younger three call him that because they are not fond of their bio father. But I have never called my stepmom mom. I was only 5 when dad and her moved in together (5 months after my mom died). She's okay. But to me I do not love her like that and I do not want her to be my mom. I have some memories of my mom and find it disrespectful. She's told me before it's never disrespectful and if I had a baby one day, wouldn't I want them to never be without a mom, I told them they'd always have a mom whether I'm dead or alive and I wouldn't want them calling someone else mom. She told me I was too young to get it so I should just follow the flow of the household and start calling her mom.\n\nMy dad and stepmom went to a meeting with my school about my IEP and there it was brought up that she was my stepmom because I tell teachers at school and my aid. Always did. But I guess it was brought up for some reason and they hated it. So they sat me down and said if I won't call her mom, then they will try to accept it, though they think she has earned that title after all these years, but they said at least stop saying dad and stepmom and start saying parents. I told them no. That when I say parents I mean my mom and dad. Not dad and stepmom.\n\nDad told me I was being a difficult little shit and why do I insist on punishing my stepmom for mom's death. I said it's not punishing her. It's doing what feels right to me. Just like the other kids do what feels right to them. He told me he doesn't give a shit about what I feel is right. THEY say what is right as an adult.\n\nStepmom said my unwillingness to work with them and compromise drives her crazy.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1687727984, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14ixnyq/aita_for_refusing_to_compromise_with_my_dad_and/", "score": 2372, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I love my father's wife, but they married after I was grown and I've never lived with them.  She's never been any kind of mother to me.  I just call her by her first name and we're cool.  My little brother was still a preteen when they got married, and he calls her step-mom even though he lived with them full time.  She's fine with that too.\n\nI also have to ask, since you mentioned IEP, are you on the autistic spectrum?  If so, they should know that many people who have autism fine it very hard to say something they feel is untruthful.  You don't feel like she's your mom, therefore calling her your mom is an untruth and why would you lie to people?\n\nShe has the right to have hurt feelings if she has raised you and treated you the same as her other children.

Don't let anyone tell you that you have to call her mom. If you're comfortable with it, do it. I'd not, don't. My stepdad was my stepdad. My dad was my dad.

And if you had a stepmom that you loved very much, and you wanted to call her mom, your real mom would be more than happy for you.\n\nThe fact stepmom wants to force you to call her mom, makes her a bad stepmom.

My new mantra on AITA posts about blended families is: Real life blended families are not the Brady Bunch.

However, my father and his second wife were introduced as my father and his wife.  Because she wasn't my parent. She tried to force it and I wouldn't let her. She was his affair partner too.

I have no idea why it would be brought up that you call your step mom your step mom at your IEP, but moving forward I would insist that you be at ALL meetings.

Secondly, her trying to argue your opinion doesn't matter because you're \"too young\" (translation: she just doesn't agree with you), is complete bs. Thirdly, I don't know why she's *so bothered.* From my understanding about step-parents, she's lucky *any* of her step-kids call her mum, let alone 2/3 of them.

I am now in my mid20s, and my step father has since passed. Looking back, standing my ground and not calling him dad is one of the best decisions I made.

That's up to you.\n\nI'm undecided on the 'parents' bit though, as that term doesn't have to mean biological parents or that she's not a step-mom, and unless she left everything up to dad, she did have a part in performing caregiving duties for a significant part of your life. IDK, it seems to me the 'mom' bit is far more important to you than 'parents', so could there be any wiggle room for that part? Maybe it's just me, but the parents title is not generally as significant as mom and dad. But yeah, your dad is being mean about it which probably makes you less inclined to even compromise on that now. And you absolutely do not have to call her mom ever if you don't want to.", "NTA\n\nYour dad sounds like a tool. He made you accept and move in with his new girlfriend just 5 months after your mom died, and now he's telling you your feelings don't matter. Age does not mean he gets to dictate how you feel.\n\nJust stay strong OP, hopefully you'll be able to move out soon.", "NTA, OP you have your feeling about your mom and step mom, and your dad and your step mom have their own feelings.\n\nIt is definitely ok that your feelings don't agree with each other, and as an adult they should know better to not force their feelings onto anyone else.\n\nBUT, be cautious after your life and relationship with your dad and your bio siblings.\n\nI said that because if your stepmom divorced the other guy because he wasn't willing to be a dad for her eldest, then she may do the same to you and push you out of the family. From what you described your dad is siding with her so you will be on your own.\n\nUsually this is when people go to counseling and seek help to understand all perspective then respect each others feelings and work around it. But I am afraid that's not an option to you or it will become a you need to get around and accept it situation.....", "As long as you\u2019re not rude about it, NTA.", "I honestly don\u2019t understand situations like this. You have a mom already. A step parent isn\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t be a replacement. Anyone who tries to force this is an AH. OP, you\u2019re well within your rights to address your step mom however way is comfortable to you. NTA.", "NTA.\nSo by your dad\u2019s logic they have to stop trying to her mom when you turn 18", "NTA", "I gather that the real problem here is not that you don't call your stepmother \"Mom\" but that your father objected to your not saying \"my parents\" during the IEP meeting. Perhaps it depends on the way that you drew attention to  the fact that they were not both your biological parents.\nDid you perhaps correct a teacher who mentioned your parents? If so, how did you do it?\n\nDid you, for example, smile and say,\n \"Actually it's my father and my stepmom.\". (Perhaps going on to explain briefly, in  order to honor your mother , that she died when you were five.)\n\nOr did you immediately interrupt the teacher and say angrily:\n\"It's not my parents.it's my dad and my stepmom. My mom's dead\".\n\nCan you see how there is quite a difference between the two ways you might have chosen to clarify the relationship?  Just as you understandably feel it would disrespect your mother to call your stepmother \"Mom\", I can see how your father might be upset if you  clarified things in the second way which is far more aggressive than the first. It would seem rather aggressive and might well give the teacher the impression that you and your stepmother have a bad relationship. \n\nIf you do, it would of course, be helpful to the school staff to know this. But if they are caring and you've had the IEP for some time, one would hope that they already do. Certainly family difficulties should be a part of any pastoral care.\n\nBut you don't say that the two of you have a poor relationship, merely that you don't wish to call her your parent because you feel it would be disrespectful to your mother. Is that the case?  Do you mostly get along fine with your father and stepmother?\n\nCertainly, your father is wrong  - very wrong - to try to force you to call your stepmother \"Mom\".  But has he actually done that?  Or was the argument because he was upset, angry, or perhaps embarrassed, by the way you pointed out during the meeting that his partner was not your mother? \n\nPeople often get more angry on behalf of pain caused to those they love than on their own behalf.  I suspect that your father felt that your words had hurt your stepmother and thus reacted angrily and irrationally.  \n\n\n Moreover, your  father  perhaps feels a degree of guilt for having moving on rather more quickly than would be considered seemly. Perhaps your stepmother suffered a degree of public disapproval at the time.  His sensitivity over this and his embarrassment may have led him to overreact to what happened at the meeting, in his desire to protect her.  \n\nDid you want to hurt her?  Do you feel resentment that she and your father seem happy, and feel that your father is perhaps dismissing the importance of your mother and forgetting her?   I think that losing a mother to death is probably the worst thing that can happen to a child.  And my heart goes out to you.\n\nIt happened to both my father and my maternal grandfather at about the same age that you were.  \nMy father was brought up by his sister who was herself only 14 when their mother died. He had only two memories of his mother. He suffered from depression throughout his life and part of it (not all)  was caused by what happened.  In those days, of course, no counselling was even considered.thNkfully that has changed. I hope that you've had counselling to help you deal with the grief concerning your mother.  Even if you have, I think it might be helpful for you to have more, now that you are older and understand a little more about life than you did when you were so tiny. \n\n Please. consider asking for counselling, or further counselling. Your teachers may be able to support you in this.  I  had it  at one point in my life. I was VERY reluctant indeed to agree to it and thought it would be embarrassing and a complete waste of time.  But I found, to my surprise,  that I was wrong. I have no idea how or why it helped me, but it honestly did!\n\nI send you my very best wishes for your future happiness.", "It amazes me how many people only see their bio parents as their parents.  It is one of the things that makes adoption hard, knowing your adopted child may never see you as their mom or dad.", "Nta\n\nI am the stepmom, and the kids only ever called me by name. Yes, their mom is still alive, and we are on good terms, but I told them that while I was joining their family, they would feel for how they would, and that was alright.\n\nOne kid the oldest never took to me. We tried everything, and when I said we, I mean, me and her parents. Even therapy, but she never got over me taking her dad from her. She was 16 when we got together, and they split when she was. We are NC with her now. Even her mom, due to her getting violent at points over the last 20 years. Niw the son we get along great. He and his mom had a great laugh because he called me mom 15 years after hubby, and I got together, and I sobbed like a baby. \n\nIn the end. No one has a right to demand you call someone something or feel something you don't. To have him say your feelings don't matter is not only wrong. It's abusive. To expect you to forget your mom. To accept who he chose next does not give her the right to anything from you other than the basic respect one gives another.", "NTA but I'm gonna have to beg you to never ever tell any children you have that you'd find it disrespectful if they called someone else mom in the event of your death.

Tell her it is not fair to use him against you in this way and you don't appreciate her using your dad to gang up on you about this. If she says that's not what she is doing, ask her, what ARE you doing? Then, when she is done talking, repeat part of what she said back to her so that she knows you heard her. Tell her that it still remains that your dad is very angry, and whether she intended it or not, it is interfering in your relationship and that since that isn't her intention, could she please drop complaining about it. And, that it is innapropriate for her to make you responsible for her insecurities about your mother.", "Not referring to her as mom, and not referring to them collectively as parents, are very different linguistically. \n\n\n\nThe term \"parent\" has a very broad meaning. It's a title, rather than an affectionate name like mom.

It's very basic autonomy.", "NTA. You don't owe her a title. The way your Dad has reacted is disgusting, frankly. \n\nPersonally I called my step-mother mum, but called my step-father by name. Just got a new stepfather at mid-thirties and have gone straight to calling him dad because he fills that role and it's meaningful for both of us. But without that meaning, there's no point. \n\nIf you don't feel it, don't say it. This is their problem, not yours. Honestly after his frustratingly childish reaction of be tempted to start calling him by name too just to be petulant \ud83d\ude02", "NTA - and I really don\u2019t understand what their issue is.", "NTA. Stand your ground. You only have a few more years then you can be out of that environment. Start saving money and planning on where you will go be an \u201cadult\u201d on your own.", "This story doesn't make sense. You were 5 when they moved in but your step mom had 3 kids who are close to to age that are not your dads?", "NTA,they gotta stop tryna get you to call her mom bc no matter what she does she aint ever gonna be your real mom and they gotta suck it up bc it's your choice and your life not theirs", ">Dad told me I was being a difficult little shit\n\nActually said that? Yeah, NTA. Who talks to their child like that and expects respect? What else is happening in that house that this type of behaviour is normalized?", "NTA my sister has a stepdaughter and she always calls her by her first name. My sister has never forced a relationship. But they are close. My sister said it\u2019s wrong to force a relationship on a child, and as long as you let them know you are there that\u2019s all that matters.", "NTA she isnt your mother, she never will be - you have a mother.  Death doesnt remove the fact of who your mother is.\n\nThey need to get over it and not bend fact - she is your step mother, they are your step siblings. You can love them, respect them, look up to her, see her as a mother figure but she isnt your mother. She needs to accept the term step mother or they will push you away and lose you once you are 18.", "No, you are not, the woman living with your father should realize that. Your father is trying to cover his guilt. Stick to your principles.", "You can\u2019t make that determination.", "That's what I am thinking... what goals and info are on that IEP? I know that for some of ours, where I am from, the parents can fill in a section about interests and their goals for the child in conjunction with educational goals from the teacher/s.", "My dad died when I was young too and I didn\u2019t want another \u201cparent\u201d or \u201cdad\u201d I still don\u2019t. I never had a step parent but if I had they would just be my mom\u2019s significant other and I could have a good relationship with them but they would not be my father.\n\nJust because you wanted a father figure doesn\u2019t mean everyone wants one too or needs them. And if they had gotten one they would definitely not need to think of them as a parent.", "Just gonna jump in here and say that my bio mum and dad separated when I was about 5 years old, and my stepdad has been in the picture since I was about 7.I've never called him dad and do not refer to my mum and stepdad as 'my parents', either. My bio dad I have spoken to maybe like 5 times total since I was a teenager, and I kinda just consider myself dad-less. I'm in my 30s.\n\nExcept my mum and my stepdad have never pushed it or had an issue with it whatsoever and just accept it. It's never even been a point of discussion.\n\nYour approach is valid, so are your feelings, and you're absolutely NTA. Your dad and stepmum are the AH here.", "I'd resent them for continually trying to force the OP into calling her mom if I were her too. It sounds like her dad and *stepmom* need therapy to accept that she doesn't want to and that there isn't anything wrong with that.", "Shitty life decisions like choosing for the bio mum to die?\n\nWhat is this comment?", "Sorry but what is IEP", "I try.  I realize Reddit isn\u2019t always the most appropriate forum for it, but sometimes I can\u2019t help myself.", "That's where the \"or something\" comes in. Talk with her with an open mind, let her know the phrases you don't like and suggest alternatives you could use. It sounds like they're reasonable enough to compromise, you just need to find phrases you're both happy with.", ">What your dad said about your feelings not mattering and him being right because he's an adult\n\nWhat was the messed up saying.\n\nI'm big, you're small, I'm right, you're wrong, and there's nothing you can do about it.\n\nYeah OPs dad needs to pull his head out of his a$$ otherwise OP is rightfully going to go LC/NC as soon as possible and it will be all Dads and Stepmums fault.", "Exactly. She should meet my step mum, aka the poisoned dwarf. She knows she\u2019s called this, she knows I don\u2019t care that she knows, she either accepts it or she doesn\u2019t.", "Refer to her as your father's wife.", "I mean yes, but men - especially - are like that.  \nHe had a truckful of kids.  \nProbably looked deliberately for a mom for them.", "The step mother appears to have chosen to have children with multiple men that were terrible fathers.", "Firstly, the comment I responded to was talking about the issue in more general terms, which is the context I answered it in.\n\nSo zero points for your compensation abilities.\n\nSecondly, as specifically relates to the shitty decisions in OP's post.\n\nThere's moving your children in with another woman 5 months after their mom died. \n\nThere's also the step mum that seems to have children with at least two different men. So she's obviously made some shitty decisions right there that she might want to gloss over with some pretty lies.", "Individualized Education Program it's for kids with special needs and learning disabilities, etc. To make school more accessible for us and help us get the most out of our education.", "Yeah, but that was the dad saying that.  \nHonestly, I feel OP has issues with her dad - and she is dealing with it by taking it out on stepmom.  \nPartly because he sounds like an actual AH, but I bet there's more going on. She didn't like how fast he got married or maybe even that he got married at all.  \n\n\nStepmom doesn't sound particularly bad. Not particularly great either - but consider the fact that all the other kids do call her mom.", "It's sad that they're *still* being so difficult about it.", "Yes, thank you. That\u2019s what I was trying to say, and indeed the OP\u2019s stepmother thinking that she\u2019s \u201cearned\u201d the title is what\u2019s wrong about the situation. So I think talking about \u201cearning\u201d, like it\u2019s something that can be ensured by the stepparent if they do the right things, is problematic. They need to do the right things because they are the right things to do."]}
