I have two bio siblings ages 14m and 13f. And I have four stepsiblings ages 19f, 14m, 14m and 12f. Mine and my brother's mom died when I was 5. Oldest stepsibling never knew her father. My other three stepsiblings dad still plays a role in their lives but was never big on the oldest and eventually my stepmom left him for that reason.\n\nMy siblings call stepmom mom since they only know her as mom, oldest stepsister calls dad that because she never had one and he was willing, younger three call him that because they are not fond of their bio father. But I have never called my stepmom mom. I was only 5 when dad and her moved in together (5 months after my mom died). She's okay. But to me I do not love her like that and I do not want her to be my mom. I have some memories of my mom and find it disrespectful. She's told me before it's never disrespectful and if I had a baby one day, wouldn't I want them to never be without a mom, I told them they'd always have a mom whether I'm dead or alive and I wouldn't want them calling someone else mom. She told me I was too young to get it so I should just follow the flow of the household and start calling her mom.\n\nMy dad and stepmom went to a meeting with my school about my IEP and there it was brought up that she was my stepmom because I tell teachers at school and my aid. Always did. But I guess it was brought up for some reason and they hated it. So they sat me down and said if I won't call her mom, then they will try to accept it, though they think she has earned that title after all these years, but they said at least stop saying dad and stepmom and start saying parents. I told them no. That when I say parents I mean my mom and dad. Not dad and stepmom.\n\nDad told me I was being a difficult little shit and why do I insist on punishing my stepmom for mom's death. I said it's not punishing her. It's doing what feels right to me. Just like the other kids do what feels right to them. He told me he doesn't give a shit about what I feel is right. THEY say what is right as an adult.\n\nStepmom said my unwillingness to work with them and compromise drives her crazy.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1687727984, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14ixnyq/aita_for_refusing_to_compromise_with_my_dad_and/", "score": 728, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My little brother was still a preteen when they got married, and he calls her step-mom even though he lived with them full time.  She's fine with that too.\n\nI also have to ask, since you mentioned IEP, are you on the autistic spectrum?  If so, they should know that many people who have autism fine it very hard to say something they feel is untruthful.  You don't feel like she's your mom, therefore calling her your mom is an untruth and why would you lie to people?\n\nShe has the right to have hurt feelings if she has raised you and treated you the same as her other children.

And if you had a stepmom that you loved very much, and you wanted to call her mom, your real mom would be more than happy for you.\n\nThe fact stepmom wants to force you to call her mom, makes her a bad stepmom.

I have no idea why it would be brought up that you call your step mom your step mom at your IEP, but moving forward I would insist that you be at ALL meetings.

(I'm 27F, brother 31 and sister 26) I don't have kids yet with my husband but both of my siblings do and their kids call her grandma or nana etc, but us kids all refer to her in person by her name only but her three bio kids all call my father their dad even though they're roughly all around the same ages as we are. All in all, it's a very personal thing for someone to decide what they call their parents S.O. no matter what and it's not up to your dad or her to decide; your feelings are yours and just because he is your father doesn't mean he can dictate how you feel and whether it is right or not. They need to understand not all relationships develop at the same pace and clearly you aren't at a place where you can match what they expect and that means there is more work on their part needs to be done and they need to be okay with whatever you choose even if it doesn't match what they want in the end.", "NTA\n\nMy step-dad came into my life when I was in second grade and I'm in my mid 20s now. I have never called him dad and both my brother and I just call him by his name. Neither him or our mom have cared at all. My stepmom also hasn't cared that we call her by her name instead of mom. Your dad and stepmom need to chill. They're making it a bigger deal than it actually is and needs to be.", "NTA", "TOTALLY NTA.\nTo each their place, sheesh! \nThe mum title isn't \"earned\". Your mum is your mum, the one you had all your previous memories with, the one who (not necessarily, but in this case) had you at in her uterus for 9 months, regardless of who's married to your dad. Same goes to parents.\n\nI understand that some people's mothers were/are horrible to them, but at the end of the day, she's still their mother, whether they like it or not. Point is a mother bond is rather felt. \n\nIMO, your stepmother should stop being so pressed about this topic, and if she really thinks that it's for your own sake, so that you can feel like you have a mother, she should be aware that it isn't about the title, but rather being a mother-like figure. Stand your ground, make that obvious to both her and your father. \nThe bond between a mother and her child is a very strong and unique bond, and you have the right to feel so. \nAlso, if you're respectful towards her and decent with her, she has nothing to complain about. I'm terribly sorry you have to go through this!", "NTA.  My oldest son is 16, and currently all my kids are living with their dad and his partner.  At 1 point my dickwad ex husband told me that my 8yo is jealous because she\u2019s not his baby anymore because the girlfriend has a younger child (NOT my ex husbands).  I was confused and said wtf why don\u2019t you just tell her she\u2019ll always be your baby?  I do.  And he says cos she\u2019s not.  Sorry, I absolutely think if you have step kids you should love them and treat them well, but holy shit no wonder my daughter is upset that he\u2019s replacing her with a kid he\u2019s known about 6 months?!?", "Just imagine the arguments if OP has kids and refuses to call step mum grandma...\n\nCould you try family therapy?\n\nNTA but this is not going to get better. They don't care about your feelings. Be prepared to go low contact when you get older and when you start working save up to move out. A bit of space can sometimes make the world of difference.", "NTA  \nYour dad and SM on the other hand ...", "NTA, as an adult (28F) and a mom, I find it annoying. You have the right to call mom and dad your actual bio parents. She's been in your life since you were 5, ok. Did she take up on a \"mother-like\" role to you? Do you appreciate it? Then that's fine. Being fond of somebody or loving them as a family IS FINE ENOUGH but calling her -mom- when she's not your actual mother and wish to keep that name to your own mother and her memory is also understandable and they shouldn't push you on it. It's about identity and honoring your own blood.", "\"hey dad, are you interested in having a relationship with me when I'm an adult?\"\n\nNTA. Only you can decide who you want to call mom.", "Nta and are lucky you don\u2019t just say dad and his wife instead of dad and stepmom", "I had a stepmother who came into my  life at an early age. I loved her, but would never have called her Mom, nor would she have demanded it. Started by calling her Aunt Sue and when I got older just Sue. NTA but they sure are. Doesn't matter what they think, it's how you feel.", "Stay strong hold your ground u got this nta", "NTA. Tell them shes called stepmom or by her name. They can pick.", "Nta", "NTA. My stepmom was like this, made a huge stink about it, and I still call her by her first name.", "NTA- missing ur bio mom is valid, ur dad and stepmom just want to have what they pictured their life going like and it happened not to include you feeling like this, which by itself is fine.\n\nWhat is absolutely not fine is how they are forcing their beliefs onto you; \"I'm an adult so I decide what's right\" is a hell of a power trip and a weird hill your dad has chosen to die on.", "NTA\n\nTo be honest, I find it extremely weird and disrespectful if children call their step parents mom or dad.\n\nThey already have a mom and dad and in my experience its mostly adults pushing it with their kids to paper over the cracks of their poor life choices.\n\nIf your step mom has been there for you and performed her role admirably, then she deserves your respect, you might even love her \ud83e\udd37\n\nHowever, you can love and respect someone without calling them mom and diminishing the position of your actual mother.", "NTA. Even if you did while it didn't feel genuine, everyone would know and feel awkward about it. On top of that, I'm with you. I never referred to my stepdad as \"dad\" once, and he entered my life when I was 8 or 9. I didn't even necessarily dislike him at the time, it just didn't feel right.", "NTA. I think you understand it quite clearly my dear, how dare she say otherwise. The fact that you do have fond memories of your Mom, that right there gives you the right to decline. She didn\u2019t push your watermelon of a body out her who-ha\u2026 so no, she has not earned that \u201cright\u201d. Stick to your guns, dear. If it\u2019s truly how you feel. You are learning a valuable lesson, do not let others \u201cchange your mind\u201d on things you feel strongly about. There SHOULD be nothing wrong with your decision. Don\u2019t let others push you around \ud83e\udd17", "NTA, stepparents don\u2019t have the right to get the parent title. Only if YOU alone are comfortable with it, if you\u2019re not then they have to accept that.", "NTA. I have kids and step kids. I don\u2019t care if my step call me mom or my name and my husband doesn\u2019t care if my bio kids call him dad or his name. We have been together since my kids were 3/5 and his were 1/2. Almost 13 years. Who cares what we are called? As long as you are not acting out about it all and being a butt just to cause strife, it\u2019s nota big deal.", "Nta. Step parents are nobody.\nJust because dad married a random woman doesn't mean anything at all. She's just a person you have to live with. \nShe's lucky you speak to her at all.", "I have two step daughters and after my wedding to their dad they asked us what they were going to call me. I told them to just call me by my name. And I\u2019ve never cared about the title \u201cstepmother \u201c. I adore those girls and they love me as well so who cares what I\u2019m called? The most important thing is we are family", "NTA \nMy daughter is about to have a stepdad and she'll be calling him by his first name. If she decides that one day she'd like to call him Dad, then that is between her and him. We won't be pushing it. She doesn't even call her bio dad by that name, she usually calls him the 'stupid other one'.", "NTA and here\u2019s why\n\nIt took me years before I started calling my stepdad, dad. I never knew my biological father and what I did know of him, I was glad he was never in my life. Like, to the point when he literally dropped dead of a heart attack, I laughed. A lot. \n\nBut then something flipped and my stepdad became my dad. He helped raised me. He kept a roof over my head, good in my stomach, and clothes on my back. He covered my rent when I moved away from home from college and left the dorms. He bought my first car. When he died, my earth shattered. \n\nHe never forced it. He never pushed for it. He always said if I wanted to call him by his first name, it would be fine. I also know it meant the world to him when I did start calling him dad. \n\nAnd it didn\u2019t happen when I was in high school. I was an angry kid. Angry at my mom for getting married and taking me away from the place I knew as \u201chome\u201d and the few friends I had. \n\nYou are young, your feelings might change some day. They might not. Them pushing the matter isn\u2019t going to help and will just make you dig your feet in harder over it. \n\nHell, tell her while you won\u2019t call her mom, maybe you guys can come up with something else to call her. Something only you\u2019ll call her. \n\nAnd to be honest, most adults can\u2019t handle not being called something. Especially stepparents. I find a lot of them are desperate to be considered \u201cmom\u201d or \u201cdad\u201d that they refuse to see reason on why the child in question won\u2019t do it. \n\nIt\u2019s pretty sad, tbh. Not you, her need to be called mom.", "It\u2019s not even earned \u2014 it\u2019s bestowed. There really is no way to earn it, no series of steps or sacrifices that completes the metamorphosis to make the stepparent appropriate to have the parental title. Because it\u2019s about the child, how they feel about their deceased parent, and what the parental title means to them.", "It's not even something you can earn, the kid has a mom ffs, nobody else is going to be mom ever.", "OP\u2019s father also called OP a little shit. He sounds awful.", "A lot of folks think compromise means \"you compromise and do exactly what I want\".", "Work on your reading comprehension. OP specifically stated they compromised with her not calling her mom. But instead of always referring to them as \"dad and my stepmom\" to instead just use \"parents\". \n\nThat is a fair compromise to consider. Stepmom is not the biological parent, but she is her parent. \n\nTBH OP sounds like they need counseling. I can almost feel the resentment bubbling from their text.", "Because it helps them feel better about their shitty life decisions that led to them having a blended family in the first place.", "This.", "idk why you got downvoted, that's the thing that jumped out at me too", "That isn't always the case. A lot of men with children after losing their wife, look for someone willing to \"mother\" the child(ren). However this is where my mind went to as well. This reminds me of another post where everyone was pressuring the teenager to call step mom mom, and op wouldn't. It only stopped when she said that she'd never call the affair partner mom. She didn't know if it was the truth, but the way the parents glared at the dad and his wife, after they shut up real quick gave her the answer to if they had been having an affair", "Agreed. \n\nSeems most commenters didn\u2019t read the entire post, just skimmed it, or are lacking comprehension skills. Since a majority seem to be focused on the fact that stepmom wants to be called mom. Instead of the point of the post being about dad and SM wanting OP to use parents to refer to them collectively and OP refusing. \n\nStep-parents are still parents so using that term would be fine. OP seems to be intentionally trying to highlight that step mom is a step and add that distance into it. That said since OP is comfortable using stepmom and parents isn\u2019t that different and shouldn\u2019t have such resistance to it. If OP really didn\u2019t want to call stepmom a parent of any sort they would refer to her as \u201cmy dad\u2019s wife\u201d or by her name.", "Utter bullshit", "Absolutely not. She wrote that she is saying what feels right to her. Just as what her siblings feel is right for them. Accept boundaries. If someone does not want you or love you, keep it moving, all this is doing is causing a rift. \n\nShe has not disrespected the step mom, her dad and stepmom are all in their feelings, and obviously don\u2019t care about hers.", "This teen is not being petty. The adults-on-paper are doing what OP probably feels like trying to erase her mother and mother's memory by insisting the stepmother be called mom. She lost her mother at age 5. My 5 year old is very much needing her mom all the time. So here is a floundering 5 year old whose world has been shredded by the loss of her mother, and dear ole dad moves in this new woman 5 months later. It reeks of affair partner or desperate dude needing a woman to do all the mental work of home & family his late wife carried. But here is this strange woman foisting herself into this small child's life and compounding the entire scope of upended existence. OP barely had time to come to terms with the loss, much less actually grieve or process the grief to reach a point of peace. This is not petty. This is a wounded child who is not being helped with her grief and is being punished for not  meeting the expectations others have for a grieving person. This is authoritarian behavior and is going to backfire on the adults-on-paper.", "in this case i dont think op would change her mind because thats not her bio mum. she has a mum already. she doesnt want another. \n\ni personally suggest creating a whole new term of endearment for her that isnt mother. that way step mum gets *some* of shat she wants, and op doesnt have to call her mum", "Why doesn't your stepmother like the word stepmom?\n\nIt's not a dirty word or an insult.\n\nIt's a fact.\n\nWhy is she so offended by reality?", "They moved in together five months after OP\u2019s mother died. That\u2019s awfully fast, especially for a grieving kid.", "No they want her to use \u201cparents\u201d to ignore the \u201cstep parent\u201d portion of it; the distinction is important.\n\nThey are trying to verbally obscure that step-parent is a *step*-parent.", "Agree. Even the Brady Bunch had transition issues, and life isn\u2019t a TV show. It doesn\u2019t seem like OP had time to process and grieve before the whole world changed yet again, and they were expected to suck it up and get on board.", "Oh no, someone has a negative opinion about my opinion! You can not say my opinion is utter bullshit, it's in fact my real opinion.  If you disagree with said opinion that's fine, that's how opinions work afterall.", "And you lack reading comprehension.", "Can you go back and try to read what I said, and try again.\n\nAlso, how has she not had time to grieve exactly? It's been 11 years. That's actually quite a while to come to grips with it.", "I want to tag onto this that any parenting expert types would actually tell him he and his wife are 100% in the wrong for forcing it. So even if adults opinions had magical power, the adults who study the topic would tell him he's 100% wrong.", "Exactly. Adults make mistakes all the time and are hardly infallible. I'm an adult and still make plenty of them. Like every other Human on this planet, I'm wrong sometimes and right sometimes. OPs dad is an asshole on top of being wrong.\n\nNTA"]}
