I have two bio siblings ages 14m and 13f. And I have four stepsiblings ages 19f, 14m, 14m and 12f. Mine and my brother's mom died when I was 5. Oldest stepsibling never knew her father. My other three stepsiblings dad still plays a role in their lives but was never big on the oldest and eventually my stepmom left him for that reason.\n\nMy siblings call stepmom mom since they only know her as mom, oldest stepsister calls dad that because she never had one and he was willing, younger three call him that because they are not fond of their bio father. But I have never called my stepmom mom. I was only 5 when dad and her moved in together (5 months after my mom died). She's okay. But to me I do not love her like that and I do not want her to be my mom. I have some memories of my mom and find it disrespectful. She's told me before it's never disrespectful and if I had a baby one day, wouldn't I want them to never be without a mom, I told them they'd always have a mom whether I'm dead or alive and I wouldn't want them calling someone else mom. She told me I was too young to get it so I should just follow the flow of the household and start calling her mom.\n\nMy dad and stepmom went to a meeting with my school about my IEP and there it was brought up that she was my stepmom because I tell teachers at school and my aid. Always did. But I guess it was brought up for some reason and they hated it. So they sat me down and said if I won't call her mom, then they will try to accept it, though they think she has earned that title after all these years, but they said at least stop saying dad and stepmom and start saying parents. I told them no. That when I say parents I mean my mom and dad. Not dad and stepmom.\n\nDad told me I was being a difficult little shit and why do I insist on punishing my stepmom for mom's death. I said it's not punishing her. It's doing what feels right to me. Just like the other kids do what feels right to them. He told me he doesn't give a shit about what I feel is right. THEY say what is right as an adult.\n\nStepmom said my unwillingness to work with them and compromise drives her crazy.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1687727984, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14ixnyq/aita_for_refusing_to_compromise_with_my_dad_and/", "score": 1454, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My little brother was still a preteen when they got married, and he calls her step-mom even though he lived with them full time.  She's fine with that too.\n\nI also have to ask, since you mentioned IEP, are you on the autistic spectrum?  If so, they should know that many people who have autism fine it very hard to say something they feel is untruthful.  You don't feel like she's your mom, therefore calling her your mom is an untruth and why would you lie to people?\n\nShe has the right to have hurt feelings if she has raised you and treated you the same as her other children.

And if you had a stepmom that you loved very much, and you wanted to call her mom, your real mom would be more than happy for you.\n\nThe fact stepmom wants to force you to call her mom, makes her a bad stepmom.

I have no idea why it would be brought up that you call your step mom your step mom at your IEP, but moving forward I would insist that you be at ALL meetings.

All in all, it's a very personal thing for someone to decide what they call their parents S.O. no matter what and it's not up to your dad or her to decide; your feelings are yours and just because he is your father doesn't mean he can dictate how you feel and whether it is right or not. They need to understand not all relationships develop at the same pace and clearly you aren't at a place where you can match what they expect and that means there is more work on their part needs to be done and they need to be okay with whatever you choose even if it doesn't match what they want in the end.", "NTA\n\nMy step-dad came into my life when I was in second grade and I'm in my mid 20s now.

That's up to you.\n\nI'm undecided on the 'parents' bit though, as that term doesn't have to mean biological parents or that she's not a step-mom, and unless she left everything up to dad, she did have a part in performing caregiving duties for a significant part of your life. IDK, it seems to me the 'mom' bit is far more important to you than 'parents', so could there be any wiggle room for that part? Maybe it's just me, but the parents title is not generally as significant as mom and dad. But yeah, your dad is being mean about it which probably makes you less inclined to even compromise on that now.

From what you described your dad is siding with her so you will be on your own.\n\nUsually this is when people go to counseling and seek help to understand all perspective then respect each others feelings and work around it.

NTA.", "NTA.\nSo by your dad\u2019s logic they have to stop trying to her mom when you turn 18", "NTA", "I gather that the real problem here is not that you don't call your stepmother \"Mom\" but that your father objected to your not saying \"my parents\" during the IEP meeting. Perhaps it depends on the way that you drew attention to  the fact that they were not both your biological parents.\nDid you perhaps correct a teacher who mentioned your parents? If so, how did you do it?\n\nDid you, for example, smile and say,\n \"Actually it's my father and my stepmom.\". (Perhaps going on to explain briefly, in  order to honor your mother , that she died when you were five.)\n\nOr did you immediately interrupt the teacher and say angrily:\n\"It's not my parents.it's my dad and my stepmom. My mom's dead\".\n\nCan you see how there is quite a difference between the two ways you might have chosen to clarify the relationship?  Just as you understandably feel it would disrespect your mother to call your stepmother \"Mom\", I can see how your father might be upset if you  clarified things in the second way which is far more aggressive than the first. It would seem rather aggressive and might well give the teacher the impression that you and your stepmother have a bad relationship. \n\nIf you do, it would of course, be helpful to the school staff to know this. But if they are caring and you've had the IEP for some time, one would hope that they already do. Certainly family difficulties should be a part of any pastoral care.\n\nBut you don't say that the two of you have a poor relationship, merely that you don't wish to call her your parent because you feel it would be disrespectful to your mother. Is that the case?  Do you mostly get along fine with your father and stepmother?\n\nCertainly, your father is wrong  - very wrong - to try to force you to call your stepmother \"Mom\".  But has he actually done that?  Or was the argument because he was upset, angry, or perhaps embarrassed, by the way you pointed out during the meeting that his partner was not your mother? \n\nPeople often get more angry on behalf of pain caused to those they love than on their own behalf.  I suspect that your father felt that your words had hurt your stepmother and thus reacted angrily and irrationally.  \n\n\n Moreover, your  father  perhaps feels a degree of guilt for having moving on rather more quickly than would be considered seemly. Perhaps your stepmother suffered a degree of public disapproval at the time.  His sensitivity over this and his embarrassment may have led him to overreact to what happened at the meeting, in his desire to protect her.  \n\nDid you want to hurt her?  Do you feel resentment that she and your father seem happy, and feel that your father is perhaps dismissing the importance of your mother and forgetting her?   I think that losing a mother to death is probably the worst thing that can happen to a child.  And my heart goes out to you.\n\nIt happened to both my father and my maternal grandfather at about the same age that you were.  \nMy father was brought up by his sister who was herself only 14 when their mother died. He had only two memories of his mother. He suffered from depression throughout his life and part of it (not all)  was caused by what happened.  In those days, of course, no counselling was even considered.thNkfully that has changed. I hope that you've had counselling to help you deal with the grief concerning your mother.  Even if you have, I think it might be helpful for you to have more, now that you are older and understand a little more about life than you did when you were so tiny. \n\n Please. consider asking for counselling, or further counselling. Your teachers may be able to support you in this.  I  had it  at one point in my life. I was VERY reluctant indeed to agree to it and thought it would be embarrassing and a complete waste of time.  But I found, to my surprise,  that I was wrong. I have no idea how or why it helped me, but it honestly did!\n\nI send you my very best wishes for your future happiness.", "It amazes me how many people only see their bio parents as their parents.

We tried everything, and when I said we, I mean, me and her parents. Even therapy, but she never got over me taking her dad from her. She was 16 when we got together, and they split when she was.

He and his mom had a great laugh because he called me mom 15 years after hubby, and I got together, and I sobbed like a baby. \n\nIn the end. No one has a right to demand you call someone something or feel something you don't. To have him say your feelings don't matter is not only wrong. It's abusive. To expect you to forget your mom. To accept who he chose next does not give her the right to anything from you other than the basic respect one gives another.", "NTA but I'm gonna have to beg you to never ever tell any children you have that you'd find it disrespectful if they called someone else mom in the event of your death.

Youngest didn\u2019t remember mom and was ok with mom but the older 2 did and didn\u2019t feel right using it. I told them that was perfectly fine and offered using my name like my step parents did.

I called him by his name, which was fine for everyone. I still do. But three decades later, I now feel comfortable calling him my stepfather, after watching how much he has loved and supported my mom since they got together, and he will often describe me to other people as his son, without even the step.
