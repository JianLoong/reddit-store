Unless you and your husband have been welded together, there's no reason why you can't take any trip on your own.\n\n\"He said he worries for my safety.\"\n\nWhat a cowardly reason to give. He probably just doesn't want to look after your offspring on his own. As if women never travel solo.\n\nYour husband is perfectly free not to travel anywhere without you, but that's on him.\n\nI'm just amazed at how many people seem to think that once you get married, you immediately lose your individual identity and can only ever act as a couple. Not forgetting the immediate assumption that you're going to cheat on him. Go on your trip, recharge and have fun.", "NTA for wanting to get away and recharge.  \n\nQuestion - what arrangements are in place for your kids to be taken care of?  Is hubs protesting because he will be completely in charge of the kids for almost 2 weeks?", "Everyone who votes YTA gets down voted, but I'm going to do it anyway, cause F the world! Lol\n\nYTA ish. A little NAH sprinkled in.\nIf my husband stashed away money to take a 2 week vacation in another country without me, I'd be sad. That's my life partner, and I would love nothing more than a break from work and family by taking a lovely vacation just the two of us. Knowing that he saw that option, and decided nah, I'll leave her home and just go myself, would make me feel hurt.\n\nYes, spending time with your kids is great, and I do it every darn day. It would be amazing to have that break with your spouse to just reconnect and have fun, and knowing they opted not to include you would suck.\n\nI get it. It is more about you needing you time, and less about not wanting others there. I'm just trying to think of how your hubby would feel, and I'd be unhappy too. Though I do see the draw of what you'd like to do.", "YTA It seems very unfair for one partner to leave the other alone looking after the kids for two whole weeks for an entirely leisure trip. A weekend is understandable. Two weeks is not. Especially as the other partner has to use their vacation to take care of the kids. I think we can agree that being a sahp is still work, so he's just changing one kind of work for another. Frankly, if my husband did this to me, it would be marriage ending. Also, I usually really hate when people say 'if the genders were reversed....' on here but in this case it's got to be true. There's no way a guy would not be roasted for leaving his wife and kids to go on holiday for two weeks.", "NAH. You are both fully entitled to your feelings, there's no one right way to feel here. There are couples that do things your way & couples that do things his way. The important thing is whether the two of you can come to an agreement you can both feel comfortable with.", "NTA. Separate travel allows you to do things your partner doesn't enjoy. As long as you each get equal opportunities for separate holidays, there's nothing wrong with it.", "I maybe in the minority but NTA, it states this is for a women\u2019s retreat not just random traveling. Sometimes you just need to decompress. Although I wouldn\u2019t be happy with my partner gone 2 full weeks tbh", "If this post was coming from a man rather than a woman then this sub's verdict would most certainly be YTA.\n\nI think your desire to travel alone is completely valid and the reasoning your husband is giving to turn it down is frankly bullshit.\n\nHowever, traveling alone for 2 weeks means leaving your husband to take care of the kids on his own for the same amount of time, potentially having to book time off work etc, so depending on how old the kids are 2 weeks seems a bit long.

But you must be able to see how it looks.\n\n>I don't think just because I am a wife and mother that I should have to completely give up things that bring me happiness\n\nOf course you shouldn't have to give up things that bring you happiness. But often being a parent takes priority over most other things in your life and removes the opportunity or freedom to do some things. It just comes with the gig. As a parent, your wants come second to the requirements of your family. \n\n> I am funding this trip entirely on my own.\n\nNot really relevant, but I always wonder about some peoples mentality when they are married, live together,  have a family and shared finances. I think it's sometimes tricky sometimes to claim \"your own\" money. I've never quite been able to balance that one myself. It sounds like you both work and both contribute to the house.", "NTA.

I love being by myself too and going away a couple of days (or even almost two weeks) sounds so blissful! \n\nI know it's (very) hard for non-introverts to understand you need time alone... I wish I could give you advise, but I can't think of anything more than let your husband know you love him. And arrange EVERYTHING for your time away.

You absolutely have the right to recharge on your own. But I do understand your husband's reticence. Two weeks is a long time to be a single parent, particularly with young kiddos.

However you have 4 young children and 2 weeks is a long time to be away from them. Have you taken other time away? Maybe a long weekend or two first?", "Imagine your husband leaving for two weeks, leaving you to deal with the kids, your business and basically everything. \n\nNow you're doing even worse because he has a full time job, 2 weeks is absolutely ridiculous to leave your partner with the kids especially for something that selfish.\n\nTotally YTA", "Nta", "Nta. \n\nYou say you used to travel alone quite often so this is nothing new for you. \nYou are wanting to de-stress  and this is something normal in your life that allows you to do that.\nYour life has been full of changes and you just need some quiet reflection by yourself. There's nothing wrong with that. Being married isn't a prison sentence you arnt forced to everything together \n\nThere's no difference in danger  between a married woman traveling alone than a single one you know what you are doing you are an adult and you have paid for it yourself.", "YTA. \n\nIf I found out my partner wanted to take a \u201cspecial\u201d vacation without me I\u2019d assume they\u2019re cheating on me.", "NTA.\n\nThere nothing wrong with wanting time to yourself/to do something by yourself. I'm like you.

You want to get up early to see x thing but he wants to sleep in. He doesn't feel like eating x today, he wants y.

You have to do kid friendly things, wrangle them all day, go to restaurants that have whatever thing they like, etc.\n\nYou said you're a SAHM. You spend your entire life putting everybody else first. It's ok to want to spend some time (yes, even 2 weeks!) doing what YOU want to do, putting YOURSELF first, and not having to be responsible for anyone else.\n\nI think your husband just doesn't want to spend the 2 weeks dealing with all the stuff you do on the daily: making meals, cleaning, laundry, taking care of the kids, etc. His \"but safety!\" excuse sounds like exactly that: you're going to a women's retreat, not solo hiking from Spain to China.\n\nGo on your trip, op. *You* are important too.", "YTA.\nI know i will get downvoted, but you give your Husband with wanting to travel alone bad ideas and suspissions.

Small kids, ton of work, I just need to unwind.\n\nHowever, i vote YTA.\n\nIf i am reversing the situation and my husband suddenly leaves for whole 2 weeks, leaving me dealing with 2 kids alone, i would not be happy. Even tho I can \u201cmanage solo\u201d and they \u201cadore me\u201d. \n\nCan\u2019t you find some compromise and take a long weekend trip? And then go together on a longer vacation? \n\nI mean, you can probably do what you want, but it is quite understandable that he is not superhappy.", ">It'd be at a retreat (women only, no kids).\n\nAh fair enough. From reading your post it sounded like you were planning some kind of solo trip. Backpack on, jumping around places to rediscover your youth type trip.\n\nI could understand your husbands safety concerns when it was you travelling alone. If it's you with an organised group? Then I agree with you.", "It's not a must, of course, but an example of what she could do. You are right, men are definitely capable of cooking, too. Personally, I would not cook for two weeks in advance, but I would prepare some meals, so that he would have the occasional easy night too while I'm away. Not because he would expect me to or something, but out of love.", "Which is work related so I guess a bit better but still shitty.\n\nYou guys clearly are at least not on the same page at worst completely out of touch.\n\nIs he supposed to work while tending to the kids while you're away having fun ? That's fucked up in both side imo", "How do you figure saying that you're going to another country with a bunch of other women is in any way reassuring when it comes to cheating ? Are you really that out of touch ?", "When I was growing up, my dad went to \"bear camp\" for week every year. My understanding of bear camp is that it was some guys renting cabins in the woods in the northern part of the state and hunting bear. I don't know who these guys were. They weren't my dad's friends. I don't even know if it was a group of people who knew each other or if it was just strangers at a camp. My dad never killed a bear. I don't know if he even tried to kill a bear. I think he just liked being alone in the woods for a week.\n\nMy mom NEVER had a problem with it. She'd be like \"have fun! bye!\" and that was the end of it. \n\nShe and I used to go on little weekend trips to New York City. Now granted I was with her, but still, my dad never complained about her going away. He was just like \"have fun!\"\n\nIt's *normal* to do things alone. I hope you go on that trip. I hope you have a fantastic time. And I hope your husband gets his head out of his ass and stops acting like a sulky baby over it. You deserve happiness, fulfillment, and you time. Never let anyone make you feel like you don't.", "I don't think he'd hold it against me, but I'd encourage him to go on a trip if he felt called to!", "That is first time you told about logistic of these two weeks and i think you should edit your post adding that - because post alone feels like \"I need this two week free of work as SAHM and my hubby have to be happy do job of two people for this time\".   \nSometimes people give dumb false reason for their feelings because they are scared truth would paint them in bad light. There is possibilty he is scared of these two weeks - and people mocking him for that \"Oh, he will spend time with his kids\" are assholes on their own as it takes two people usually to make one SAH parent.", "Please don\u2019t listen to the haters on here; a lot are very young, very immature people with either incredibly narrow-minded views or with no life experience whatsoever.\n\nIf anyone in my academic, urban bubble tried to prevent their partner from taking a solo trip, nobody would take them seriously anymore, it would be regarded as outright ridiculous. Moms deserve breaks and time away for themselves as well!", "Ultimately it\u2019s all voluntary. He expressed his feelings. You expressed your needs. No one is wrong. But there might be consequences to the relationship. I would never do anything to purposely hurt my wife. But I also try to be supportive. Perhaps there\u2019s a compromise? A one week trip in the same country?", "[removed]", "Thank you \u2764\ufe0f", "Whenever he'd like one! I'm his biggest supporter in having time to go away himself, I'd even happily book it for him!", "I wouldn't mind the trip, but I wouldn't be happy to use up two weeks vacation when my family isn't all together, especially if it's the type of job where you get a day a month or a certain amount of time a year", "Thank you for your view!", "[deleted]", "I should've  been more specific (I've updated now!). \n\nThanks for your views, I appreciate it!", ">Ah fair enough. From reading your post it sounded like you were planning some kind of solo trip. Backpack on, jumping around places to rediscover your youth type trip\n\nHow does that make a difference? Travel is travel. Just calling it a retreat instead of a resort doesn't magically change the essence of the trip...", "No, he'd be enjoying his annual leave and bonding with his children", "....because I'm married to a man and not into women, therefore wouldn't cheat? \ud83d\ude02", "Thank you", "Go you. Hope it all works out ok.", "Thank", "Why?", "How many vacation days does he have? Because if he already took 2 weeks off to take care of the kids during your trip, and you want to go on a trip together, how is he going to have any time left to take off to actually go by himself?\n\nBtw I do think you should be able to go on a trip by yourself, but I think that maybe 2 weeks is too long if your husband has to use so many vacation days to do it. Would you be able to go for just 1 week instead?", "But he\u2019s giving up an actual vacation to do this? His \u201cvacation\u201d this year is parenting solo?\n\nThat\u2019s shitty. No way would I do that to someone I claim to love. I\u2019d personally arrange it so he continues working and a parent or trusted sitter looks after the kids during the day. Then hubs can take an actual vacation himself (or with you and the kids).", "Oh wow, that sure adds context to some of his resentment lol", "So he has to use his time off so that you can have fun in Europe and he is not supposed to be pissed about it ? You're such a great wife", "Yeah so you're completely oblivious to the way the world works that is even scarier ... \n\nLet me paint you a quick picture, group of girls having a drink in a local place, obviously out of scene will draw a lot of attention, alcohol, novelty, these situations will happen. You probably won't cheat, but you have to understand the worry.\n\nNobody says you'll cheat with your girlfriends...", "Ignore him. Look at his very small comment history.", "[removed]", "Well we are different in the sense that I'd enjoy some solo time (because I'm never alone) and he'd prefer to travel with the family. So he would be happy to go together like I mentioned at the end of the year.\n\nTotally hearing you about the length. I'd be travelling from Australia so the time it takes is about 2 days total, so bites into the time quite a bit! But perhaps I have to look into shortening it if I go", "He would still, by that time, have about 8 weeks or so of paid holiday time available. So yes he'd be giving up two weeks to be with his kids. \nWe haven't got grandparents or sitters around to be with them from 7am-6pm daily unfortunately. I hear your points and thank you for them.", "Oh no, he has to actually spend time with his kids, gasp! The horror!", "And it sounds like you're making a lot of assumptions. A woman's only retreat doesn't necessarily mean they're out drinking. \n\nPerhaps she knows herself better than you do.", "It's a women's retreat in rural Italy. Think yoga, Not a party trip \ud83d\ude02", "Good call!", "So a woman who works from 6am - 8pm with children, home duties AND a business is never entitled to a break?", "Entirely missing the point but keep trying", "So we can only work with what she gives, I tell her the concerns that could exist based on the situation and it's supposed to not be valid because \"she knows herself\" ? \nThen why post here if you're not able to take the criticism?", "You live in a fairy tale, that's concerning. I understand your husband, in the end the choice is yours. You obviously already decided to go anyway, don't be surprised about how your husband will react when you're back", "You do understand this is a grown woman and not some little kid, right? What is wrong with you?\n\nYou do know it\u2019s 2023 and not the 1800s, right? Women are entitled to travel internationally whenever and wherever they please. And no, the fact she\u2019s married doesn\u2019t change a thing. Marriage does not equal being attached by the hip and never being able to have some time to yourself.", "Yeah sure I'm so misogynistic for not wanting one parent (I made it clear in another comment that it's the same for her husband) leaves the house for 2 weeks without any arrangements for his own pleasure.\n\nI don't care how you call this, this is pure selfishness, when you have a family your \"me\" time is greatly reduced, think about it before having kids.\n\nGoing on a trip ? Why not, but 2 weeks, on a different continent ? You're delusional if you think it makes any sense for a normal family.", "For his own pleasure?\n\nShe\u2019s a SAHM so she literally NEVER gets time away to herself without a kid around. Why can\u2019t the husband parent HIS OWN KIDS for once?\n\nApart from that, she said he also has options to choose something to his liking for his time off. Why can\u2019t they take turns, she travels for a while and next time he gets to do something? That\u2019s a very fair deal and there is absolutely no selfishness involved."]}
