{"id": 34254, "submission_id": "18xip80", "title": "AITA for refusing to change birthday plans?", "selftext": "This year I actually felt like celebrating my birthday and I even found activities I wanted to do. I told my boyfriend these activities and that I\u2019d like to celebrate either the Saturday or Sunday before my birthday with my friends and some of his. My birthday is on a Monday but I have lectures and would just like to have dinner out with him in the evening. He hadn\u2019t made the reservations yet but I found out that a friend in his group (I\u2019m still going to know them) was planning to visit that weekend into the next week (the Friday to Tuesday). \n\nWhen this friend reached out to me, I learned that this was planned months in advance and that my boyfriend knew. He didn\u2019t mention these plans to me before. I let his friend know that my birthday was the Monday but we haven\u2019t made reservations yet, and that we\u2019ll figure that out and let him know when we\u2019ll stop by. \n\nI talked to my boyfriend about this and he said he forgot but ultimately he agreed to start booking reservations (it\u2019s about two months away). Things turned sour once it was time for him to actually send invitations. He asked me if I could celebrate my birthday the week before, to which I said no because that\u2019s the weekend after Valentine\u2019s Day and likely when we\u2019ll celebrate. \n\nHe suggested that I celebrate the weekend after my birthday, but I refused because I didn\u2019t think I should have to change when I celebrate- after all, his friend would be in town for the weekend into the next week. He got heated calling me selfish for not changing when I celebrate. He said I\u2019m forcing his friends (only three) in that group (it\u2019s a fairly large group) to pick between the group events for that day or my birthday plans. I suggested we do something with those friends separately after the weekend, but then he said that meant they\u2019d miss my original birthday plans and that\u2019s selfish of me to not consider their FOMO and to just change my plans to a different day. \n\nMind you, those friends were wonderful and had already decided to skip the group events for that day since they\u2019ll have multiple days for other activities. The only person with the problem is my boyfriend. I told him that it\u2019s not like he\u2019s going to stay with them at their Airbnb the entire time, but he said he wants to and threatened to move my activities since he was planning and he can do what he wants. I got frustrated and told him I no longer felt like celebrating my birthday and he said, \u201cproblem solved\u201d. \n\nThroughout this interaction he was shaking and angry. I tried to keep calm until he texted his friend who wanted to celebrate with me that I only my him and my friends there. I had been calm until then when I called him a fucking liar for phrasing it like I didn\u2019t want them there with me. \n\nSo Reddit, AITA for not having caved and just changed the weekend I want to celebrate my birthday? \nPlease let me know if you have any questions or need clarification on anything. Thank you for your time.\n\nEdit: \nMy boyfriend has done a wonderful job of planning my birthday before and I plan his. I don\u2019t expect him to plan for Valentine\u2019s Day this year. I told him I would handle it. He\u2019s usually very nice and doesn\u2019t get upset about anything- I\u2019m not sure why this time is different.

Your comment that you felt like celebrating your birthday this year indicates that you haven\u2019t in previous years. Your boyfriend may have understandably (if a little foolishly) made other plans for that weekend assuming you wouldn\u2019t want a birthday celebration. You announce you want a birthday celebration and for some reason expect him organise it and he realises he has some juggling to do. He suggests that you celebrate the week before, but no, you want a separate Valentines celebration. You suggest a separate celebration with the friends who can\u2019t make it for your birthday and he crosses the line, calling you selfish and getting angry. He had no right to lash out at you like that, but you seem to be expecting a lot from him - Valentines Day, for him to organise your weekend birthday celebration with activities the way you want it and then going out for dinner on your actual birthday. He did in fact have prior plans that you are expecting him to drop because you decided you want a birthday celebration. Just organise your own birthday, whenever you want, and invite who you want. They can decide which event they\u2019d like to attend.", "OP - I'm not sure how to rate this one. Exactly how old are you going to be on your b-day? I've learned a few things as I've grown older and one of them is that birthdays become less celebrated as time goes by for most people because it's just another reminder that life is passing by way faster than you thought it would and your just another year older with more wrinkles and grey hair. So, there are a couple of things with all of this that was not right; your boyfriend knowing for an extended period of time that friends were coming that weekend and not letting you know in advance of those plans, and your bf making it sound as though you didn't want his friends to celebrate with you. That's manipulating and outright lying to others to benefit his own selfish needs and wants. Do you want to have someone like this in your life for years to come? Serious questions need reflection, and you should be asking yourself some serious questions about this relationship.", "ESH - you sound exhausting and you boyfriend clearly doesn't care about your birthday at all.", "ESH. This is a situation where both sides refuse to compromise, and as a result, everyone is miserable.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
