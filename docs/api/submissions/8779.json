He\u2019s never been receptive to my emotional conversations and was very distant when I would get depressed about my dad\u2019s death.\n\nHe\u2019s a generally nice person, but I don\u2019t feel comfortable introducing him to my girlfriend\u2019s family for other reasons. He\u2019s traditional (believes in the working man-homemaker wife dynamic), and has made comments about working women being unable to raise their kids to my mom and I. \n\nHe dislikes how my girlfriend flaunts her intelligence and \u201clectured him\u201d for making a sexist joke when she was visiting. However, he is civil and polite to her when she\u2019s around. He told my mom it would be an honor to meet my girlfriend\u2019s parents. He considers himself to be like a father to me. Undeniably, he\u2019s helped out my family and I a lot, but he doesn\u2019t try emotionally connecting with me that much.\n\nMy girlfriend resembles her mom strongly, as they are both hard workers and have sought higher education. However, they are both serious people and are not easy-going, so there may be some conflict between them and my mom\u2019s husband. \n\nAdditionally, my girlfriend and her parents have no interest meeting him as I\u2019ve told them repeatedly that I don\u2019t consider him a a father.

Other reasons I do not wish to include my mom\u2019s husband to this meeting are that he is an anti-vax conservative dislikes immigrants (my girlfriend\u2019s parents are immigrant doctors). He also doesn\u2019t know about my girlfriend\u2019s line of work, which her parents are very vocal about, and he wouldn\u2019t take kindly to it either.\n\nAdditionally, my girlfriend isn\u2019t allowed at family events for my family (like Christmas and Thanksgiving) because I am not married to her, according to my stepfather and mother, who are traditional Catholics.\n\nEDIT: I know my calling my mom\u2019s husband nice wasn\u2019t a great step.

He obviously cares about you, you don't need to call him dad but be thankful he does! Many people have terrible stepparents, and something that you should try to think about is that it might be difficult for your stepfather - he joined your family. He has had to put you above himself when it comes to interacting with your mother (to a lesser extent because it sounds like you were an adult when he came into the picture but still). Imagine if your girlfriend had a child- you'd always be second to that child (as it should be). This is the dynamic your stepfather has.

You wouldn't do big life things without your gf ? \n\nYou're an adult and can do what you like , your reasoning just doesn't really ring true to me .

Totally a YTA situation. )\n\nBut like a lot of AITA threads, that's not what you are actually describing here. What you are actually describing here is using the \"not my dad\" thing to exclude your Mom's husband from the wedding, which may result in your having a motherless wedding, because he's her HUSBAND. It's not a casual relationship. She married the guy.\n\nGenerally, here in the US, the couple is seen as the core unit of society. And in our society, yes, it's super weird to invite one person in a couple and to specifically exclude the other member.\n\nThis means that by excluding your step-father, you will be putting your mom in the position of having to to chose between her daughter and her primary relationship. And that's just a yucky position for anyone to be in.\n\nI'm not your therapist, but if I were, I'd ask about this idea of things not being \"malicious\" as you put it, because it seem to me that you do dislike this guy, and it is deliberate to want to exclude him, which is malicious. But maybe he deserves malicious, yes? Maybe he's pissed you off, coming into your home and marrying your Mom and not being the kind of man who you need him to be. He's not good to you, and he's sleeping with your mom and this is ick, and if I were a therapist, I'd say that acknowledging this anger is a really good thing. It's OK to be pissed at someone who is attacking you!\n\nI think you know what a hard position you are putting your mom in. This is why you were asking your future inlaws for permission to not bring him, which is, again, a weird boundary issue. You don't need your fiance's parents permission to be mad at someone who has hurt you!\n\nThis guy is not your Dad. He is your step-father though. That's just a legal situation.

No winners here.", "Just want to preface this by saying you 100% do not need to accept him as a dad, he doesn't need to come to meet your gf's parents and everything will work out but YWBTA but not because you won't call him dad.\n\nYou are 100% intentionally being rude and maliciously excluding him. Your mom has every right to be pissed and reject the offer to meet her family. Her husband is her family and not liking the guy won't change that.

I would allow the mall to meet however I would make it very clear to everyone involved that this is your mother's spouse and not your parent that they are meeting. You are not THA for being honest about how you feel about your relationship with her spouse. I mean it's kind of a sticky situation because everybody holds meeting the parents our parents meeting one another at a different value when in a relationship but at the end of the day it's just that. Let's say you and this partner go the long haul your family is going to be entwined forever if that were to happen which would include the stepfather so there's no reason to not include him other than to be disrespectful but again you don't have to identify him as a father figure or even your stepfather.

If you had been more circumspect with your opinions about him they wouldn\u2019t even know the difference.  Parent meetings are pretty shallow events. Everyone is usually on their best behavior.

This here is the bit of information that makes it all clear, for me, anyway. \n\nYWNBTA for excluding your mother's husband from this one meeting, because it's a cultural thing. Also, YWNBTA for insisting that your stepfather be invited, because it's generally disrespectful in Western culture to invite only one spouse to an event where all the others are couples.\n\nYou and your fiancee are caught in the middle between two clashing cultural expectations, and the people on both sides are expecting you to pick a winner. \n\nYour future in-laws have an expectation that this meeting will be between them and only the people who you feel are parents to you (counting visiting your father's grave). Your mom and stepfather have an expectation that you see both of them as parental figures and therefore they should both attend the meeting. Expectations are just premeditated resentments. Someone is going to be disappointed, because they're all expecting another adult to do what they want them to do.\n\nFirst, for general relationship health, and to get out of the middle of this, you need to be open about your relationship with your stepfather with both your mom and stepfather. (I use that word because he is your stepfather, legally, but I don't attach any meaning to it other than a legality.) Make it clear that you like your stepfather and see him as a friend, but not a father figure. You have good reason: he married your mother after you were an adult, and is only a few years older, and therefore not a source of wisdom the way a father figure is. If he's offended by that, he's very presumptuous and a little weird, tbh, given your ages, but his feelings are his business and not your problem.\n\nNow that your mom and stepfather understand your relationship, ask your in-laws to host this meeting. That makes sense, since it's their cultural tradition. Ask them to invite whomever they see fit, but inform them that excluding your mother's husband, whatever his relationship with you, is a sign of disrespect in your culture. Inform your mother that if she doesn't show up, that's a huge insult in your fiancee's culture. Then let them do their thing and refuse to be responsible for anyone else's behavior. Hopefully, no one will want to communicate disrespect, now that they understand how their actions translate in the other culture, but just refuse to be responsible for anyone's actions but your own. If your fiancee's parents don't invite your stepfather, then he can hate them and not you or your fiancee. If your mom won't come to the meeting, your future in-laws can be angry with them and not you. And the most important relationships are intact.\n\nGood luck.", "Then they should respect the fact that he is married to your mother, and as such, he is her partner. So if the meet her, he should be allowed to be present. They sound extremely closed minded the more you add.

You have to be honest that you\u2019ve only said that to her bc you didn\u2019t want to cause tension in the past but now you\u2019re at a point in life where you\u2019re going to have to distance yourself from her if she\u2019s with someone who causes unnecessary issues in your relationship.", "Behind the Bastards just did a 4 part series on Tate and how is toxic- IDK if it would help, but might help to hear, for you to combat that influence?  Know where the crazy is coming from?", "BRUH!!!!! Absolutely not!!!!!", "If you met my brother, you would think, nice enough guy....\n\nbut he is a massive racist, gun nut, MAGA weirdo. But that is not something that comes up just everywhere.  (We do not speak- but I have seen him and heard him at enough shared family events- yup, he has gotten more nutty as we get older, despite studying Ghandi 30 yr ago in college like a fiend. DOn't ask me where he went off the rails- but he sure did)", "The stepfather be a racist bigot seems like a pretty good reason to have drama. And he was in his 20s when his dad died. Ofc he\u2019s not his dad. Is every guy that your mom slept with your daddy too?", "Your mother is in an abusive marriage. You are not going to fix that by kowtowing to him, hiding your girlfriends career and giving him the opportunity to insult her parents.\n\nYou need to be honest with your future in-laws that he\u2019s a bad man that you only keep in contact with to make sure your mother is okay.  That is the reality of the situation.  Or you\u2019re going to have to do the hard thing (which is coincidentally the grown up thing) and calmly set boundaries and not just trying to please everyone.  \n\nHe\u2019s a bad person that you\u2019re letting dictate your life. Your mother made her choices you need to make yours", "Your mother's husband abuses her, is what that boils down to. Controlling who your partner sees and when they see them is a form of abuse. Not to be glib, but him taking issue with your girlfriend's line of work makes a lot more sense with that information. I'm sorry that that's a factor, that makes the situation you're in a lot harder to manage. \n\nWhile I think some might argue that you should let him come for her sake, you do have to remember that if you let him cross the boundary you've set this time, he will continue to do so every single time he has the chance. If you two end up having kids, it will be that much worse to deal with his behavior. I'd say that on the other hand, missing this meeting might be a wakeup call your mom needs to see how his behavior hurts her, but it could just as easily cause him to restrict her contact with you. One way or another, it's a good idea to figure out your game plan for the fallout here.", "You talk about the values and political beliefs of your father and this guy your mother married.\n\nDoes she have her own beliefs?\n\nI know that your post was about including him. Sorry I didn't go there first. YWBTH.  Your future in-laws shouldn't be subjected to this fool.\n\nBack to your mother tho. Does she have a mind of her own or just goes along to get along?\n\nI can't even be around a trumpster bigot, let alone live with one.\n\nHow is it that she went from a free thinking person to a bigoted kid?\n\nShe sounds trapped. This is worrisome.", "Yeah, I almost got whiplash from that one !  NTA!", "Exactly. I wouldn\u2019t consider someone family and give them family access when they\u2019re horrible people to me and others", "Um, Mexicans and South Americans also have European ancestry. Not all of them have Native bloodlines. Like in the US and Canada,  there\u2019s a large ancestral mix. Few are \u201cpure blooded\u201d any more. Also, not everyone from south of the US border has black hair, brown eyes, and brown skin. Again, it\u2019s a mix of colors. I know blondes, red heads, Blacks, and some of Japanese ancestry from various countries in South and Central America. Yes, I know the majority have black hair, etc., but then, so did my Dad who was 100% Caucasian. In fact, he tanned each summer so dark that he was darker than a couple of my Black friends! (I grew up on the border in Southern California in a diverse, heavily Catholic community.)", "What in the crackhead hell are you on about?? I stated I think it's dumb that European immigrants came to the Americas and decided where the people native to the land mass could live or migrate to. Mexican people are native to the North American continent and were here before Europeans floated over. I don't know why that set you off.\n\nI also don't know why you felt the need to bring up your white dad's hair color or ability to tan in a discussion about arbitrary/ artificial borders being imposed on native people by non-native people. My blonde white mom's ability to tan has nothing to do with my blackness or the US / Mexican border, hence me not feeling the need to bring it up in my initial comment \ud83d\ude02", "[removed]", "NtA", "NTA. \u201cYour husband isn\u2019t my parent. You have no problem excluding my partner, I don\u2019t see a need to include yours.\u201d\n\nFrankly, I\u2019d cancel the meeting altogether. \u201cYou made it clear you wouldn\u2019t attend without your husband, and I accepted that.\u201d", "NTA\n\nYour mother is being disrespectful of you and your feelings. The man clearly didn't father you. It sounds like he barely pays you any attention. I would tell her she can't dictate my feelings about his place in the family. He doesn't even sound like a stepfather to me, more like my mother's husband.", "I foresee a lovely future for you and your gf where you are fully accepted into her wonderful family and never have to see any of the AHs in your own again. I'm including your mother in this because a) that age gap is eww b) she endorses the sexism and bigotry of her husband c) she acts nastily towards your gf (I mean, my family were very trad Catholics as well, but my bf was welcome at Christmas nonetheless). \n\nNTA. Gird your loins and cut the bastards off now by refusing to have him meet your gf's parents.

I call major bullshit on this post!", "Nothing in the post indicates he's racist.  Stay on topic and don't add your own narrative.  Still not seeing what his age has to do with anything. And that's his mom's husband not \"some guy she's sleeping with\".  Again don't add your own narrative.....", "Read his edit where he says he is sexist and dislikes immigrants. Also read his comments where he says he\u2019s racist. And age has a big part to do with it. He wasn\u2019t raised by this man. You don\u2019t just replace a dead parent figure with someone who played no Rosie in raising you. If he had been his stepfather since his teens or something and raised him as his own child then sure call him dad. This man married an adult mans mom. Ofc he\u2019s not a father figure to him", "Yeah I see where hes editing things to get people to agree with him. Racism is pretty serious. I feel like if that was a big deal to him (or even really happened) he would have put it in his original post. \n\nHis moms new husband by definition is his stepfather whether he likes it or not. Sounds like OP better cope or keep causing problems.", "Perhaps your right about putting it in the first post but step father and father are two completely different things. I have no problems with my step mom but she will never be my mother. I have a mother and no one can replace that", "Okay well this post isn't about you.....or is it lol?\n\n\n *person who's totally not OP posting from their alt account*", "I assuming he feels the same way which is why I brought it up. So very clever with the alt account joke that is literally on every single thread.
