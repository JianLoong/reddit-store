He obviously cares about you, you don't need to call him dad but be thankful he does! Many people have terrible stepparents, and something that you should try to think about is that it might be difficult for your stepfather - he joined your family. He has had to put you above himself when it comes to interacting with your mother (to a lesser extent because it sounds like you were an adult when he came into the picture but still). Imagine if your girlfriend had a child- you'd always be second to that child (as it should be). This is the dynamic your stepfather has.

You wouldn't do big life things without your gf ? \n\nYou're an adult and can do what you like , your reasoning just doesn't really ring true to me .

Totally a YTA situation. )\n\nBut like a lot of AITA threads, that's not what you are actually describing here. What you are actually describing here is using the \"not my dad\" thing to exclude your Mom's husband from the wedding, which may result in your having a motherless wedding, because he's her HUSBAND. It's not a casual relationship. She married the guy.\n\nGenerally, here in the US, the couple is seen as the core unit of society. And in our society, yes, it's super weird to invite one person in a couple and to specifically exclude the other member.\n\nThis means that by excluding your step-father, you will be putting your mom in the position of having to to chose between her daughter and her primary relationship. And that's just a yucky position for anyone to be in.\n\nI'm not your therapist, but if I were, I'd ask about this idea of things not being \"malicious\" as you put it, because it seem to me that you do dislike this guy, and it is deliberate to want to exclude him, which is malicious. But maybe he deserves malicious, yes? Maybe he's pissed you off, coming into your home and marrying your Mom and not being the kind of man who you need him to be. He's not good to you, and he's sleeping with your mom and this is ick, and if I were a therapist, I'd say that acknowledging this anger is a really good thing. It's OK to be pissed at someone who is attacking you!\n\nI think you know what a hard position you are putting your mom in. This is why you were asking your future inlaws for permission to not bring him, which is, again, a weird boundary issue. You don't need your fiance's parents permission to be mad at someone who has hurt you!\n\nThis guy is not your Dad. He is your step-father though. That's just a legal situation.

No winners here.", "Just want to preface this by saying you 100% do not need to accept him as a dad, he doesn't need to come to meet your gf's parents and everything will work out but YWBTA but not because you won't call him dad.\n\nYou are 100% intentionally being rude and maliciously excluding him. Your mom has every right to be pissed and reject the offer to meet her family. Her husband is her family and not liking the guy won't change that.

I would allow the mall to meet however I would make it very clear to everyone involved that this is your mother's spouse and not your parent that they are meeting. You are not THA for being honest about how you feel about your relationship with her spouse. I mean it's kind of a sticky situation because everybody holds meeting the parents our parents meeting one another at a different value when in a relationship but at the end of the day it's just that. Let's say you and this partner go the long haul your family is going to be entwined forever if that were to happen which would include the stepfather so there's no reason to not include him other than to be disrespectful but again you don't have to identify him as a father figure or even your stepfather.

If you had been more circumspect with your opinions about him they wouldn\u2019t even know the difference.  Parent meetings are pretty shallow events. Everyone is usually on their best behavior.

That's not how life works. You can't \"like him\" but also slap him by excluding him from all family events.   \n\n\nYour soon to be inlaws only dislike him because YOU'VE been gossiping about him. He had no chance to be good to them. He had no chance to put his ego aside and be good to YOU. You just decided for everyone that you know what's best. And what is best is that you try to orchestrate everyone else's relationships.   \n\n\nYikes. This just gets worse and worse. You might not be an AH for the origianal question, but this is AH behavior.   \n\n\nIf I take you for your word, and you really do like this guy, you are the biggest AH I've seen on these threads for a while. Because you betray people that you like, and exclude them from \\*family.\\* Even though you like them.   \n\n\nThat's just SO MESSED UP. Please do better.", "That definitely explains why you wouldn't see him as a father figure, even if he didn't have some abhorrent beliefs.", "Okay. This here is the bit of information that makes it all clear, for me, anyway. \n\nYWNBTA for excluding your mother's husband from this one meeting, because it's a cultural thing. Also, YWNBTA for insisting that your stepfather be invited, because it's generally disrespectful in Western culture to invite only one spouse to an event where all the others are couples.\n\nYou and your fiancee are caught in the middle between two clashing cultural expectations, and the people on both sides are expecting you to pick a winner. \n\nYour future in-laws have an expectation that this meeting will be between them and only the people who you feel are parents to you (counting visiting your father's grave). Your mom and stepfather have an expectation that you see both of them as parental figures and therefore they should both attend the meeting. Expectations are just premeditated resentments. Someone is going to be disappointed, because they're all expecting another adult to do what they want them to do.\n\nFirst, for general relationship health, and to get out of the middle of this, you need to be open about your relationship with your stepfather with both your mom and stepfather. (I use that word because he is your stepfather, legally, but I don't attach any meaning to it other than a legality.) Make it clear that you like your stepfather and see him as a friend, but not a father figure. You have good reason: he married your mother after you were an adult, and is only a few years older, and therefore not a source of wisdom the way a father figure is. If he's offended by that, he's very presumptuous and a little weird, tbh, given your ages, but his feelings are his business and not your problem.\n\nNow that your mom and stepfather understand your relationship, ask your in-laws to host this meeting. That makes sense, since it's their cultural tradition. Ask them to invite whomever they see fit, but inform them that excluding your mother's husband, whatever his relationship with you, is a sign of disrespect in your culture. Inform your mother that if she doesn't show up, that's a huge insult in your fiancee's culture. Then let them do their thing and refuse to be responsible for anyone else's behavior. Hopefully, no one will want to communicate disrespect, now that they understand how their actions translate in the other culture, but just refuse to be responsible for anyone's actions but your own. If your fiancee's parents don't invite your stepfather, then he can hate them and not you or your fiancee. If your mom won't come to the meeting, your future in-laws can be angry with them and not you. And the most important relationships are intact.\n\nGood luck.", "Then they should respect the fact that he is married to your mother, and as such, he is her partner. So if the meet her, he should be allowed to be present. They sound extremely closed minded the more you add. Your mother is well within her rights to refuse to participate in a ritual that doesn\u2019t respect her as a whole human being in her own right.  As that whole human being in her own right, she wishes to have her partner, her husband, by her side for this event.  Severing her from that is rude.

Oops.", "Ah, your edit changes things quite a bit for me.
