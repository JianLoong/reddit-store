He obviously cares about you, you don't need to call him dad but be thankful he does! Many people have terrible stepparents, and something that you should try to think about is that it might be difficult for your stepfather - he joined your family. He has had to put you above himself when it comes to interacting with your mother (to a lesser extent because it sounds like you were an adult when he came into the picture but still). Imagine if your girlfriend had a child- you'd always be second to that child (as it should be). This is the dynamic your stepfather has.

You wouldn't do big life things without your gf ? \n\nYou're an adult and can do what you like , your reasoning just doesn't really ring true to me .

Totally a YTA situation. )\n\nBut like a lot of AITA threads, that's not what you are actually describing here. What you are actually describing here is using the \"not my dad\" thing to exclude your Mom's husband from the wedding, which may result in your having a motherless wedding, because he's her HUSBAND. It's not a casual relationship. She married the guy.\n\nGenerally, here in the US, the couple is seen as the core unit of society. And in our society, yes, it's super weird to invite one person in a couple and to specifically exclude the other member.\n\nThis means that by excluding your step-father, you will be putting your mom in the position of having to to chose between her daughter and her primary relationship. And that's just a yucky position for anyone to be in.\n\nI'm not your therapist, but if I were, I'd ask about this idea of things not being \"malicious\" as you put it, because it seem to me that you do dislike this guy, and it is deliberate to want to exclude him, which is malicious. But maybe he deserves malicious, yes? Maybe he's pissed you off, coming into your home and marrying your Mom and not being the kind of man who you need him to be. He's not good to you, and he's sleeping with your mom and this is ick, and if I were a therapist, I'd say that acknowledging this anger is a really good thing. It's OK to be pissed at someone who is attacking you!\n\nI think you know what a hard position you are putting your mom in. This is why you were asking your future inlaws for permission to not bring him, which is, again, a weird boundary issue. You don't need your fiance's parents permission to be mad at someone who has hurt you!\n\nThis guy is not your Dad. He is your step-father though. That's just a legal situation.

No winners here.", "Just want to preface this by saying you 100% do not need to accept him as a dad, he doesn't need to come to meet your gf's parents and everything will work out but YWBTA but not because you won't call him dad.\n\nYou are 100% intentionally being rude and maliciously excluding him. Your mom has every right to be pissed and reject the offer to meet her family. Her husband is her family and not liking the guy won't change that.

I would allow the mall to meet however I would make it very clear to everyone involved that this is your mother's spouse and not your parent that they are meeting. You are not THA for being honest about how you feel about your relationship with her spouse. I mean it's kind of a sticky situation because everybody holds meeting the parents our parents meeting one another at a different value when in a relationship but at the end of the day it's just that. Let's say you and this partner go the long haul your family is going to be entwined forever if that were to happen which would include the stepfather so there's no reason to not include him other than to be disrespectful but again you don't have to identify him as a father figure or even your stepfather.

Sure he thinks he is your dad, but your gf knows he isn't, her parents know he isn't, so maybe just let him \"embarrass\" himself if he insits to be stepfather. If your gf parents are petty they can ask him about his favourit moments as father and child with you or what he thinks about %a real or made up interest of you% and let him struggle answering the questions. If this doesn't give him some stuff to think about, he is maybe not smart enough for a life outside his bubble. \n\nI wouldn't normally suggest something like this and always prefer honesty, but it sounds like this announcement could mess up your mothers marriage.", "He sounds absolutely horrible!

He's going to be sitting with your mother at the wedding, right? It could cause some social faux pas issues down the line. \n\nIt's fine that you don't consider him a father figure, and it's wonderful that your in-laws want to pay their respects, but maybe nix the outdated ideal of a \"meet the parents\" dinner being some big deal and just have a couples dinner with your in laws, your fiance, your mom, and her husband? Be clear that he is to be introduced as her spouse, not your father figure, and go from there.\n\nIt could help to prevent any hurt feelings or awkward situations at the wedding itself.\n\nEdit: your edit loaded for me after my comment. \n\nThat does change things. Don't keep the peace for someone who doesn't seem to respect your girlfriend at all. Gross.", "NTA.

That your future in-laws have feelings to not meet him is... well... maybe a sign of what your life with them will be?  THAT would give me pause.", "YWBTA for refusing to permit your mother's husband to be present during the meet the parents event.

His title and whether there is family agreement on his title is irrelevant.\n\nYour mother's husband being a mix of pleasant and unpleasant is also relevant, but not sufficient. That's lots of people. What is decisive is that 1) you, personally, are not estranged from him, and 2) it is not uncommon for the parents of a couple to dislike each other in the first place.\n\nI consider what you are suggesting to be rather patronizing.

Her parents are Asian immigrants, so this isn\u2019t a small deal to say the very least, and they were kind enough to inform me on why that is. \n\nIn her family, this sort of meeting has been preserved for several generations prior to marriage.

He lives a life of sexism and xenophobia.", "Is he a MAGA nut?\n\nI think the warning I shared can be extended a bit to cover these issues.\n\nAt the end of the day, it sounds like he is conservative and needs to learn to be respectful of people who don't share his values.

Make it clear that you have every intention to call out all misbehavior, but you can't guarantee that you'll catch everything. If you do miss something that upsets, you hope that she will share as soon as possible, and then you'll confront him and your mom.\n\nDO NOT try to keep the peace with people like this.

Also, sometimes for the sake of peace, one (your gf) doesn\u2019t always need yo correct (unless it\u2019s completely abusive) every point she doesn\u2019t agree with.

You just talk about it in advance and come up with a strategy for changing the subject if they veer into uncomfortable territory. \n\nIt's really rude to invite your mother to a social event and exclude her husband, and it's going to cause issues in family relationships.
