She had a brain hemorrhage around thanksgiving and now cannot move much, but still can talk. She is a bit confused at times but still herself. \n\nI don\u2019t want to spend my whole day there or much time with her because she\u2019s insufrible. She begins to yell at me for the smallest things in front of others. For example, i went to get her food, but since the restaurant was 20 minutes away there and back, plus in times square where parking is near to none, it took round trip around 40-50 min. so came back to her yelling at me, saying i can\u2019t do anything right. \n\nanother example: My father was there and asked me a question. I began to answer and she began yelling at me saying i\u2019m so selfish for talking to my father. My father tried to explain it was a simple question and she began to say oh you\u2019re defending the princess. She is the princess i forgot we csnt say anything to her. Yelling this while confined to a hospital bed. She has always been horribly me and hateful towards me my entire life. \n\nI don\u2019t want to waste my days driving 2 hours to her and 2 hours back. I have finals and rather be grieving in the comfort of myself or my friends. My sister 30 F says i\u2019m gonna regret this, how it\u2019s my fault I get hurt because I have unresolved issues with her. She is basically guilting me for not being around all the time. As if i don\u2019t visit, yet I do just for about an hour at a time, last week i was spending my whole day there she just began to be abusive and mean again and it has a negative effect on me and my mental health. Which i\u2019ve tried to explain to my sister but she says its not my mothers fault it\u2019s mine for having personal unresolved issues and i\u2019m letting her die alone. In my pov, if you do not want to die alone, then don\u2019t be so abusive towards people trying to help you, sounds harsh but it\u2019s how i feel. \n\nTldr: AITA for not wanting to visit abusive dying mother in hospital ?", "created_utc": 1670254250, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zd9xc2/aita_for_not_wanting_to_spend_as_much_time/", "score": 68, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The action taken is limiting time spent in the hospital with my dying mother. \n2. I may be an asshole because it\u2019s selfish. Maybe i should be there with her all day. Yet i can\u2019t sacrifice that much time for her without detriment to my own happiness. It is not fulfilling but a chore because i get yelled at, taunted and old wounds i\u2019m trying to patch up are getting reopened by her. She is saying things that will never be forgetting and instilling new insecurities and validating current ones.
