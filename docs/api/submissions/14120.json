It was not OP's place to say that really. However, it's such normal behavior to \"check\" a sibling on something like this (siblings call each other out all the time), that I think it would be unreasonable for me to say OP was being an AH.", ">younger child privilege\n\nWhat is this? Is it that younger children are given more of a \"pass\" on the rules or something?", "I feel though my sister feels she is in the right. My mum gave her everything nothing ever happened to her I always had strict rules she never had to follow one example is she cheated on her boyfriend my mum didn't even look up and said he'd get over it my ex cheated and she told me I had to have done something wrong.", "Yes.\n\nAs the baby of the family, I can wholeheartedly agree that I had it a lot easier than my older siblings and even my older siblings.", "Yep new parents are often strict on rules for the first kid, then as more kids come along relax a bit as they 'know' what they're doing now plus less strict with money as they're earning more, relaxing become less strict as more kid come with some of the teaching behaviour aspect getting load of onto the older kids", "Those two experiences aren't really parallel -- if you had cheated on your ex and your mom said you were wrong, and then your sister cheated on her ex and your mom said he would get over it, that would be a fair comparison.", "I don't understand the golden child philosophy, I seriously don't. It does nothing except bring bad things.", "This is relatable as hell with me! My mum has become a complete push over and let\u2019s my sister basically bully her. She gets her way and lives a grand old life with all her \u2018rich\u2019 friends yet me and my brother have had to work hard since the age we legally were allowed to and pay our way for a lot of things. We got disciplined and given the cold shoulder for stepping out of line but with her my parents basically grovel at her feet of she raises her voice.

She throws tantrums because your parents let her.", " I wouldn't go as far as calling you an a-hole. But I would recommend you to stop trying to correct your sister.", "NTA ~ If your Dad had done that already, she wouldn't be whining to you.", "i disagree, her sister brought her into this, she wasn't even gonna entertain it until she was brought up. And idk how other sibling relationships work but as an older sister why wouldn't she give guidance, especially if her parents weren't? Just cause her parents suck doesn't mean a child doesn't deserve parenting. Like imagine being able to help your SISTER but you stay silent and let her turn out the way she is cause you're \"not her parent\", yea but she's her sister, doesn't a sibling bond count for anything?", "I dont think she was being a parent, she was just being a straight up older sibling. As a teenager I would definitely listen to my older sister over my parents. My parents could say something 1000 times and it not get through but as soon as my sister said it, it would sink in.", "I disagree. If the parents were talking to the daughter and OP butted into the conversation, that would be him interfering. She was complaining to him about how she wasn't getting anything and he had all these things provided to him and OP corrected her assumptions and shared his opinion of her.  Siblings have their own relationship and call each other out for behavior they don't like all the time without involving parents, this is exactly that. \n\nNTA", "NTA", "If her parents dont do it, who else beside OP?", "Yes, her sister brought her into the argument looking for support but she could have just corrected her and explained about her jobs and own money.

I\u2019m pretty sure if sister would have kept her name and situation she obviously either knows nothing about or is deliberately twisting around the facts  op wouldn\u2019t have gotten involved. I\u2019m pretty sure if you walked into a room and hear someone lying about your situation you would set them straight, that\u2019s all that was being done.. along with a lot of truth bombing.\nMom is an enabler and dad seems to be deferring to what mom says but they both need to be on the same page with raising this girl.", "And as the oldest of 4 . Me and the youngest were the fav 100 percent. I was also the only boy. Me and my stepsister could do no wrong. My sister and my other stepsister were treated fine and all but definitely favoritism. By my dad and my stepmom. Even my bio mom doted on my youngest sister."]}
