Is it that younger children are given more of a \"pass\" on the rules or something?", "I feel though my sister feels she is in the right. My mum gave her everything nothing ever happened to her I always had strict rules she never had to follow one example is she cheated on her boyfriend my mum didn't even look up and said he'd get over it my ex cheated and she told me I had to have done something wrong.", "Yes.\n\nAs the baby of the family, I can wholeheartedly agree that I had it a lot easier than my older siblings and even my older siblings.", "Yep new parents are often strict on rules for the first kid, then as more kids come along relax a bit as they 'know' what they're doing now plus less strict with money as they're earning more, relaxing become less strict as more kid come with some of the teaching behaviour aspect getting load of onto the older kids", "Those two experiences aren't really parallel -- if you had cheated on your ex and your mom said you were wrong, and then your sister cheated on her ex and your mom said he would get over it, that would be a fair comparison.", "I don't understand the golden child philosophy, I seriously don't. It does nothing except bring bad things.", "This is relatable as hell with me! My mum has become a complete push over and let\u2019s my sister basically bully her.

And idk how other sibling relationships work but as an older sister why wouldn't she give guidance, especially if her parents weren't? Just cause her parents suck doesn't mean a child doesn't deserve parenting. Like imagine being able to help your SISTER but you stay silent and let her turn out the way she is cause you're \"not her parent\", yea but she's her sister, doesn't a sibling bond count for anything?", "I dont think she was being a parent, she was just being a straight up older sibling. As a teenager I would definitely listen to my older sister over my parents. My parents could say something 1000 times and it not get through but as soon as my sister said it, it would sink in.", "I disagree. If the parents were talking to the daughter and OP butted into the conversation, that would be him interfering. She was complaining to him about how she wasn't getting anything and he had all these things provided to him and OP corrected her assumptions and shared his opinion of her.  Siblings have their own relationship and call each other out for behavior they don't like all the time without involving parents, this is exactly that. \n\nNTA", "NTA", "If her parents dont do it, who else beside OP?", "Yes, her sister brought her into the argument looking for support but she could have just corrected her and explained about her jobs and own money. OP is four years older which makes the sister only 10 when OP begun her first job, most 10yo (especially those that are priviliged) doesn't notice all details about an older sibling.

I\u2019m pretty sure if sister would have kept her name and situation she obviously either knows nothing about or is deliberately twisting around the facts  op wouldn\u2019t have gotten involved. I\u2019m pretty sure if you walked into a room and hear someone lying about your situation you would set them straight, that\u2019s all that was being done.. along with a lot of truth bombing.\nMom is an enabler and dad seems to be deferring to what mom says but they both need to be on the same page with raising this girl.", "And as the oldest of 4 . Me and the youngest were the fav 100 percent. I was also the only boy. Me and my stepsister could do no wrong. My sister and my other stepsister were treated fine and all but definitely favoritism. By my dad and my stepmom. Even my bio mom doted on my youngest sister.", "NTA. Mom failed to parent and older sister gave a reality check.

Presumably your sister is pretty  - pretty and popular go hand in hand at that age.  The good news is that she's in for a rude shock after 18, unless your parents are going to beggar themselves satisfying her requirements.", "NTA \n\nYour sister brought you into it and you responded.", "nta", "Well tell Mom that if she parented her, you wouldn't have to.

Telling sister about reality.  Get a job or find a sugar daddy and kill him off before he realizes his mistake.\n\nSee how your mom likes that version of life.   \n\nSorry, I should not have said that.  I have seen too many women with no way to support themselves in a bad relationship and had o stay because they had no other way of supporting themselves.  Or found themselves out on the street making ends meet the only way left.", "NTA\n\nI mean your parents are who have enabled her to be this entitled. I mean if they have the means and are happy to be generous, that's fine, but if she has no gratitude then it's become a problem.", "It relates to me as hell! My mom became a total jerk over and let my sister basically bully her.

This was a discussion between the 2 sisters.  younger one accused older one of getting preferential treatment because of what she has so older sister clarified the facts, that she worked for everything she got and it wasn't handed to her, so why not get off your butt and go earn some money.\n\nMom is crippling younger daughter.  Does she plan to financially support her for the rest of her life? if not then she better make some changes and quick, like have her get a job and learn the value of money.\n\nNTA and good for you, you've demonstrated a good work ethic and this will serve you well while your sister will view herself as a victim of circumstances (brought on by her own behavior and mom's spoiling)", "Even when she\u2019s saying something completely untrue about op? That\u2019s what started it. Sis was saying their parents gave op way more than her. This is untrue as op has been working to afford her own things since she was 14.\n\nShe pointed this out- stating if sis wanted to have as much as op did when she was that age she should like op actually get a job too us just a blatantly obvious continuation of that.\n\nSis dragged op into it to use as a prop to get her leverage to get more.\nShe just didn\u2019t think it through.\n\nNTA -if I was op I couldn\u2019t just ignore someone trying to use me like that.", "So real. By the time I came along my parents were older (40s) and had spent the past 15 years getting my older siblings to behave. I still had rules to follow, but way less than they did. They also had more disposable income by the time I was a teenager, so I definitely got a bigger allowance.\n\nOn the flip side, when my siblings were buying their first houses, my parents were guarantors for their loans. When I was buying they could no longer do that, having retired. Also, my siblings had a lot of childcare time from my parents, whereas in my case they no longer have as much energy for it. So win some, lose some."]}
