If the parents were talking to the daughter and OP butted into the conversation, that would be him interfering.

I\u2019m pretty sure if you walked into a room and hear someone lying about your situation you would set them straight, that\u2019s all that was being done.. along with a lot of truth bombing.\nMom is an enabler and dad seems to be deferring to what mom says but they both need to be on the same page with raising this girl.", "And as the oldest of 4 . Me and the youngest were the fav 100 percent. I was also the only boy. Me and my stepsister could do no wrong. My sister and my other stepsister were treated fine and all but definitely favoritism.

Does she plan to financially support her for the rest of her life? if not then she better make some changes and quick, like have her get a job and learn the value of money.\n\nNTA and good for you, you've demonstrated a good work ethic and this will serve you well while your sister will view herself as a victim of circumstances (brought on by her own behavior and mom's spoiling)", "Even when she\u2019s saying something completely untrue about op?

By the time I came along my parents were older (40s) and had spent the past 15 years getting my older siblings to behave. I still had rules to follow, but way less than they did. They also had more disposable income by the time I was a teenager, so I definitely got a bigger allowance.\n\nOn the flip side, when my siblings were buying their first houses, my parents were guarantors for their loans. When I was buying they could no longer do that, having retired. Also, my siblings had a lot of childcare time from my parents, whereas in my case they no longer have as much energy for it. So win some, lose some.", "NTA...  you didn't say anything that wasn't true..", "NTA\n\nBut it kind of bugs me, that your parents, both parents, gave you anything.

If she doesn't want schooled she needs to keep herself to herself.\n\nThat wasn't parenting, that was trying to be a good sibling. You told her exactly what she needed to do if she wants money. Not your fault that she'd rather sit on her ass play the blame game.", "It was OPs place to say because the sister had it coming when she antagonized OP over money.", "Oh yeah! I\u2019m the baby of my family and even I know I got a lot more crap and got away with a lot more stuff than my siblings! I admit it!

What she got was enough and asking for $200 for a single shopping trip was bratty. \n\nHowever, your parents are somewhat of AHs because they seem to  treat her better than you and she now expects it. The both of you have (had) a right to some allowance growing up.

The younger children are usually able to get away with things the older children can never get away with. Just to give a few examples here.\n\n1.) stay up way longer than the older children or no curfew.\n\n2.) get anything and everything they want\n\n3.) break any and all the rules and the parents ignore the younger child.\n\n4.) the younger child/children can wear what they want go where they want. \n\n5.) get all the money they want, no questions asked.\n\nI'm sure their is more but that is basically it. The younger children are spoiled get what they want etc.", "You sound jealous which is fair but you also have to understand expecting you to pay for all that you do is the unfairness.

They live in a nice area but for all we know they could be house poor. She's also sixteen. A lesson needs to be learned but still getting money from their parents isn't being financially dependent on them for the rest of her life. She's a minor. OP probably shouldn't have had to be dependent on herself to buy all the things she did.", "Statistically, oldest children get the best deal in terms of life outcomes (higher incomes, higher IQs, etc.). The most common assumption in the literature that this is because parents spend so much more one-on-one time with oldest children during the most formative years of child development (0-5) relative to younger children, who rarely get one-on-one attention. The privilege is relative. \n\n(obviously, I am a youngest child!)", "NTA.  Your mum is confused.  You weren't parenting her.  You were giving her a good swift kick in the backside.  I have done the same thing to my little brother on multiple occasions.  She's 16.  She's old enough to have a job and earn her own spending money.  Your dad understands this. and realizes they're at risk of having to support her the rest of her life if she doesn't feel the cold hard slap of reality now to prepare her for the future.", "NTA\n\nYour parents need to grow a spine."]}
