Both SOs parents are adamant that BIL is sorry but \u201cdoesn\u2019t know how to apologise.\u201d Also, his new GF \u201cdoesn\u2019t know the person he used to be\u201d and MIL says we can\u2019t tell her because if she knows he \u201cneeds therapy\u201d she may not love him.\n\nAlso MIL does not (luckily) have cancer.\n\nIt\u2019s now a week before this dinner (which BIL tried to change to a brunch two days ago), and we still have received no text apology. We just contacted MIL and told her we are not attending, as BIL obviously has no interest in reconciliation and we are done being manipulated.\n\nWe don\u2019t even know if BIL is aware that an apology is what we are waiting for - or if MIL has orchestrated this whole scenario herself.
