Up until a few weeks ago, I thought he was also forced to marry me. He asked me to find some pictures off his old phone and I found messages between him, his father and my father around 6 months before the wedding where they were discussing the wedding. I had only been told 2 weeks before and was led to believe that he had too. Instead, he knew atleast 6 months in advance and that when my dad had told his friends and family that he planned to marry me off, my husband actually offered himself up as the groom because he thought I was attractive.\n\nNaturally, I was heartbroken. When Neil and I were newlyweds, I was a wreck. He was so patient and kind and we bonded over us both being forced into the relationship which I found out now is a lie. He provides for me completely, regularly buys me gifts and is in general a very loving partner to me. He also put me in therapy for my unresolved mental health issues from my teenaged years. I felt completely betrayed and he apologised to me profusely. He paid for my flight to go and stay with my brother because I wanted space and after some consideration, I decided to let it go. I know my decision sounds ridiculous, but I can't change the past and I'm happy now regardless of what happened. For practical reasons, it also wouldn't make sense for me to leave him because I'm still a student and I don't have any savings. We began counselling and have been making a lot of progress.\n\nMy father and I had a very difficult relationship and when he forced me to marry Neil, I was actually supposed to be living with him for university. I had previously been with my mother and her husband and the environment was hellish, so I was extremely excited to move in with my dad after years of us not speaking, it was all actually a ploy to marry me off. I didn't speak to him for a few months after the wedding (Neil fully supported me) but I eventually forgave him because Neil turned out to be the perfect partner. Now that I found out that my dad actively deceived me into believing Neil was also forced into the marriage, I've decided I no longer want a relationship with him.\n\nI called him today after avoiding him for a few weeks and told him that I knew the truth, and that I no longer wanted to speak to him. I also told him that I had chosen to forgive Neil and we were going to work through it together. He said that I was being unfair as I was letting Neil off but choosing to undo all the work I did on my relationship with him. He also said that since I'm happy now, I have no right to punish him for 'making me happy' (forcing the marriage and I had no right to let Neil off for the same thing.\n\nAITA for choosing to cut my dad off but forgiving my husband for the same thing?", "created_utc": 1675362498, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10rwwnr/aita_for_forgiving_my_husband_but_punishing_my/", "score": 184, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I cannot imagine the emotional toll that takes on a person or the effects that it has on your sense of self. The struggles you are going through are completely valid. \n\nWith the fact that your husband chose to marry you based on appearance, I can see how this would now undermine every experience you\u2019ve had with him in the past. He lied to you, or actively deceived you for 3 years. And I don\u2019t like the age difference at all knowing that you were forced into this. He was 25, and you were 18. It\u2019s not uncommon.. but it\u2019s something to keep in mind. \n\nHowever..\n\nReading what you have provided and given the situation you\u2019ve been put in, it is a relief to see how accommodating your husband is being with your healing process. It really does sound like he genuinely cares about your mental health and your well being. \n\nSomeone who only loves you only for your appearance may not take the risk of sending you far away to a family member where they can\u2019t watch over your decisions or influence how you feel about the information you\u2019ve been given. He\u2019s letting you handle this how you want to handle it. \n\nIn my opinion, your forgiveness still wasn\u2019t something you needed to give Neil, but it will lead to a healthier step forward in your relationship. \n\n\nAs for your father, I am so terribly sorry. Your excitement to reunite with your father turned to dust in your hands when he used you living with him as a ploy to marry you off. I can\u2019t even begin to imagine how that would feel. Your happiness now is something that you have despite what your father did, not because of it. You had to work HARD for your happiness, don\u2019t let him take any of that credit. \n\nYour father is the one who put you in the situation.

Arranged marriage may still be a practice in parts of the world but it is a fundamentally inhuman thing to do.\n\nEDIT: Realized I didn't explain the rest. OP is the AH because yes, she is keeping both of these men to very different standards, is actively trying to fix only one of the two relationships, and seems to have made this decision at least partially because of the 'practicality' of what her husband can provide her with.", "ESH\n\nBut I guess maybe you might make this work.", "NTA. But your husband is. I hope you can get away from all of these toxic men.", "I know you now love your husband. But if a friend told me what you\u2019ve written out here I would be offering her a place to stay for as long as she needed. This is horrific, and honestly I think what your husband did is worst. He *lied* to you. He wanted you because you were a pretty 18 year old. \n\nI understand wanting to stay cause you have no money. So if you don\u2019t want to leave now, try to find a job, and lock down your birth control. Don\u2019t let your husband know you have it.

Like, OP can do whatever they want but Neil\u2019s part in this is really predatory and creepy.\n\nShe\u2019s pretty so he offers to have her forcefully married to him, and then pretends to be in the same position to build her trust essentially just for his own benefit\u2026idk that would almost disturb me MORE than what the dad did (both are fucked up tho)", "Please note that an arranged marriage is when two WILLING people enter a marriage with prospects that were primarily selected by their families.

They did end up moving to her parents' and we saw each other toward the end of high school. She had two kids before she was 21. Never figured out if they were concerned about the family's reputation after the details of the tragedy became known, if they needed the dowry to cover expenses associated with the tragedy or if they were worried that not marrying young was how the tragedy befell the older sister... but yeah, not a great life to be a teenager in an arranged marriage \ud83d\ude2c", "Well, it's been only three years since she was forced to marry by her father.

It sounds like a major reason you've forgiven your husband is because you're financially dependent on him. It also sounds like you haven't actually forgiven him, but you've transferred all your anger to your dad. You have every right to be angry. But your husband was wrong to do this. You were still a teenager; he was an independent adult who knew exactly what he was doing. He lied to you and manipulated you for years. He would have kept lying if you hadn't caught him. He lied because he knew it was wrong but he was selfish; he didn't care. He was happy to take away your choice in the matter, just as much as your father was, because they both got what they wanted with no consideration for what you wanted.

He effing bought you. Lied to you and robbed you of your youth and freedom because he wanted someone like you to mold into his perfect little wife. Wtf. That's not healthy. You need to leave now.

These men have manipulated you and cut you off from any kind of independence, and making your own choices is the first step to finding yourself in the midst of it. \n\nI think it makes sense to have kinder feelings for your husband than your dad. Your dad is the instigator of this entire conflict; if he could\u2019ve just been chill, you wouldn\u2019t have had to marry anyone. There are varying degrees of social pressure involved here, and it seems likely that you could have easily married someone much worse. He lied to you, but he also put a ton of work into that lie and into connecting with you. It feels special to be chosen, and it feels special to have someone who knows where you\u2019re at and how you\u2019re feeling.\n\nIn the matters of the heart, there is no such thing as fairness.

I'm thinking he's just waiting to get you pregnant so he can be \"sure\" you won't get away, then there will be more \"surprises.\"\n\nIt makes me sick just reading this story. OP, you're so groomed that you're \"happy\" with this man? Stay in therapy and make sure the therapist isn't someone your husband picked, or someone who is in touch with your husband, telling him everything you say to keep you in line.", "If you think NTA, I highly encourage you to include it in your comment as you are currently the top comment, and the next top comment is ESH.", "Also, OP, just because you forgive him now (when you are in a vulnerable spot and he is the best of bad options), doesn't mean that you have to stay with him in 5 years. You may feel that this is your best option for now. But don't get pregnant with him and revisit what you think of the relationship once you complete your degree and have some means of independence.", "Your analogy does not apply in this situation. She owes nothing to either men, let alone fairness.\n\nFairness would have been a woman who was not sold or manipulated in the first place. She can do whatever she damn well wants with either of them now.", "She\u2019s an asshole for being a victim?", "You can say that, but that doesn't make it true. Consent has absolutely nothing to do with terming something an arranged marriage.", "Honestly I expected the thread to be deleted based on the subject matter and only wanted to encourage OP to keep getting mental health support because this is such a shit show.", "Shit, sounds like that, not my intention. I will edit to explain.", "Longer discussion, which I kinda think is warranted, is that OP really is in an extremely bad spot. There aren't many places or cultures world-wide that recognize arranged marriages anymore and I really don't know enough about it to not sound like some sort of bigoted american trying to impose my will on a 'lesser society', because it really isn't my place, area of expertise, or business to dictate what anyone else does.\n\nBut I am sickened that there are so many places in this world that still treat women as secondary citizens and property. Heck, I'm angry that OP isn't raising hell against her husband, father, government, etc. all, at this bullshit. Sadly I am not financially sound enough to donate more than a few dollars to causes I support and work 7 days a week running my own business.\n\nBut because I want to be at least somewhat impartial with OPs situation, it is an AH move to hold these two people in her life to very different standards over an act they jointly committed against her. Personally, it's her husband that's being treated too fairly, not her father unfairly.", "I am pretty sure my ex-girlfriend is in an arranged marriage. Her parents broke us up (I was unaware they didn\u2019t know I existed), my parents saw her with a wealthy older guy from my town, and last I saw on LinkedIn, she was working for her dad and didn\u2019t finish her medical degree.", "\u201cYou\u2019re NTA but you are a seriously misguided abuse victim and you should not stay in this marriage with this awful man\u201d is how you could say that.", "\"Everyone\" includes OP, you called her an AH.", "... Which is the code for this sub that means everyone's an asshole...", "Yeah and it's gonna get worse cause husband now knows he can get away with manipulation and lying as long as he can make her think she's happy.", "What a fucked up thing to say. She was forced into marriage and is now financially and legally entwined with someone while making no income. She has chosen to create the best, feasible outcome in an extremely shitty scenario. Forgiveness does not make her an asshole.", "Again, I did not call her an asshole. ESH stands for everyone sucks here. It's right there in the voting guide.", "True. I\u2019m concerned for OP. Still doesn\u2019t make OP an asshole or sucky.", "Sure it does. She forgives out of convenience. Her husband had an equal part in forcing her into that marriage, so don\u2019t pin it all on the dad.", "Everyone in that verdict here includes OP\u2026 that\u2019s sub speak for every person involved which includes OP\u2026", "Referencing a voting guide that you clearly don\u2019t understand how to use - fascinating", "OK, how does she suck?", "Double standard regarding forgiveness, staying with her deceitful older husband because financially it's sensible vs. leaving.", "See below", "She is the victim here. She can have whatever standard she wants, especially, if it allows her to make the best of a situation that was forced upon her.", "YTA. You should punish both of them. Sure at the current moment you don't have savings and are a student so it's actually wise to keep on living with your husband until you find a job. But after you are able to support yourself I would leave your husband too. He deceived you the same way your father did. Your father is right that both of them are guilty so both of them should be punished.", "NTA but I would like to know why you think you can trust your husband?  Do you see yourself with him and having children in the future?   I would think long about this and maybe go to therapy some more.", "I can't help but feel Neil could have been deceived as well. You should talk to him, unless you don't need to. He may have offered himself up as tribute, but he may have done it is earnest. He may have been lead to believe that you wanted this arrangement and were on board. You have no idea what lies they told Neil until you know know. \n\nStill, at 25, you're still very young and naive and if you're in a culture that does arranged marriage, you are likely to have great respect or obligation for someone older than you I'd imagine. Lastly, Neil might have seen himself as your Savior. He may have had the idea that he's better than your father, or an asshole you could end up with. He treats you right, respects your boundaries and emotions as you've expressed them, and I think there are some apology gifts in there too. \n\nI don't think Niel sounds like a bad guy at heart, where your father clearly is. NTA and I hope you have a happy life with Neil for as long as you want Neil.", "NTA, for punishing your dad. But your husband is also 100% at fault. He agreed to marrying a teen when he was nearly 30. \nGet out of there, and live a life", "INFO - are you planning on having children with this man?\n\nIf you have a daughter, will your husband promise you not to marry her off\u2026and then secretly make arrangements with another father for months to do what he pleases? Will he pull the same tricks on behalf of his son, if his son wants to marry a pretty girl against her will? Will he believe that as long as he showers you with apologies and provides monetary reassurance, he can get away with anything?\n\nNTA for refusing to forgive your father: your father has not apologized and blatantly has no regrets. Why would you owe him forgiveness? But you may be an asshole to yourself and your future family if you allow a dynamic where major violations and repeated lies can be smoothed over with gifts and indulgences.", "..how many camels did your dad get for you? Nta if this is true but what century are you all living in", "This whole situation is creepy as fuck. What country did this happen in?\n\nESH", "Your dad and husband are both predators who don't view you as a human with agency or deserving of respect. Your husband isn't the nice guy you think he is, and that is a hill I will die on. How nice of him to put you in therapy knowing he is a big part of the reason.", "NTA\nStaying in the marriage and playing nice until you finish your degree, get a job and can escape is a perfectly valid response to actions as heinous as these.", "Your husband is just as bad as your father.  He actively lied to you and would have continued to do so if you hadn't seen the messages.  But you are NTA.  Your husband and father are.", "This just makes me sad. You aren't the asshole for any of this, but you are absolutely the victim of terrible and disgusting predatory behavior by both your father and your husband. Unfortunately it seems like your husband still knows how to manipulate you.", "I could never find happiness with a husband who so blatantly deceived me, then rode out that lie by making himself look like a knight in shining armor. I\u2019d want to throw up and flee the country if my husband ever did that. People like OP make me hate the concept of forgiveness", "You realize OP is the victim here, right? Saying she sucks too is victim blamey in my opinion.", "Eh, I feel like it's totally okay for OP to mooch off the man who participated in, if not grooming, at the very least predatory behavior toward someone who had just turned of legal age and was forced into a marriage. It's also not OP's responsibility, as the victim, to hold anyone accountable for their behavior.", "\u201cthere we go\u201d? what kind of sick \u201cgotcha\u201d is that? it\u2019s as if you are implying OP is staying with her husband just to suck money out of him when actually it\u2019s because the whole situation forced her to be financially dependent on him.", "A lot of abuse victims make nice until they are in a safe place to GTFO", "I think that's what they mean. I read it like 'there you go' = you are saying this because you are trapped and have been forced into this. \n\nI didn't read it as victim blaming/gold digging the situation... hopefully that's right!", "Very true, but based on OP\u2019s post, it doesn\u2019t sound like she plans to leave her husband.", "There is a substantive difference between arranged marriage and forced marriage - the problem is the people who facilitate forced marriages refer to them as \"arranged\".", "no, youre thinking of forced marriage. people in an arranged marriage are allowed to say no. full stop.", "fingers crossed! maybe you are right and i was too quick to judge", "Most forced marriages are arranged marriages but not all arranged marriages are forced.", "Exactly.", "This is it. There are people who willingly enter into arranged marriages for a variety of reasons. Just because some people may not understand their reasons doesn't mean that they can't consent.", "She would have cut off her dad whether she cut of her husband or not. Her dad is facing consequences of his actions, which is separate from how she chooses to treat her husband. By your logic, cutting off her father would have been more \u201cfair\u201d if her husband had been truthful. The fact is, her husband doesn\u2019t impact how she reacts to her father\u2019s shitty behavior. Her unique relationships with both men is reflected in how she responds differently.", "Her unique relationship circumstances are that the husband is providing for her and buying her nice things, so she doesn\u2019t care that he bought her and manipulated her into believing he was a victim too.", "Huh?\n\nI say this genuinely - has a girl used you for money? Your conclusions are extremely odd to the point where I have to wonder if you\u2019re projecting"]}
