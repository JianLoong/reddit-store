Up until a few weeks ago, I thought he was also forced to marry me. He asked me to find some pictures off his old phone and I found messages between him, his father and my father around 6 months before the wedding where they were discussing the wedding. I had only been told 2 weeks before and was led to believe that he had too. Instead, he knew atleast 6 months in advance and that when my dad had told his friends and family that he planned to marry me off, my husband actually offered himself up as the groom because he thought I was attractive.\n\nNaturally, I was heartbroken. When Neil and I were newlyweds, I was a wreck. He was so patient and kind and we bonded over us both being forced into the relationship which I found out now is a lie. He provides for me completely, regularly buys me gifts and is in general a very loving partner to me. He also put me in therapy for my unresolved mental health issues from my teenaged years. I felt completely betrayed and he apologised to me profusely. He paid for my flight to go and stay with my brother because I wanted space and after some consideration, I decided to let it go. I know my decision sounds ridiculous, but I can't change the past and I'm happy now regardless of what happened. For practical reasons, it also wouldn't make sense for me to leave him because I'm still a student and I don't have any savings. We began counselling and have been making a lot of progress.\n\nMy father and I had a very difficult relationship and when he forced me to marry Neil, I was actually supposed to be living with him for university. I had previously been with my mother and her husband and the environment was hellish, so I was extremely excited to move in with my dad after years of us not speaking, it was all actually a ploy to marry me off. I didn't speak to him for a few months after the wedding (Neil fully supported me) but I eventually forgave him because Neil turned out to be the perfect partner. Now that I found out that my dad actively deceived me into believing Neil was also forced into the marriage, I've decided I no longer want a relationship with him.\n\nI called him today after avoiding him for a few weeks and told him that I knew the truth, and that I no longer wanted to speak to him. I also told him that I had chosen to forgive Neil and we were going to work through it together. He said that I was being unfair as I was letting Neil off but choosing to undo all the work I did on my relationship with him. He also said that since I'm happy now, I have no right to punish him for 'making me happy' (forcing the marriage and I had no right to let Neil off for the same thing.\n\nAITA for choosing to cut my dad off but forgiving my husband for the same thing?", "created_utc": 1675362498, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10rwwnr/aita_for_forgiving_my_husband_but_punishing_my/", "score": 371, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I cannot imagine the emotional toll that takes on a person or the effects that it has on your sense of self. The struggles you are going through are completely valid. \n\nWith the fact that your husband chose to marry you based on appearance, I can see how this would now undermine every experience you\u2019ve had with him in the past. He lied to you, or actively deceived you for 3 years. And I don\u2019t like the age difference at all knowing that you were forced into this. He was 25, and you were 18. It\u2019s not uncommon.. but it\u2019s something to keep in mind. \n\nHowever..\n\nReading what you have provided and given the situation you\u2019ve been put in, it is a relief to see how accommodating your husband is being with your healing process. It really does sound like he genuinely cares about your mental health and your well being. \n\nSomeone who only loves you only for your appearance may not take the risk of sending you far away to a family member where they can\u2019t watch over your decisions or influence how you feel about the information you\u2019ve been given. He\u2019s letting you handle this how you want to handle it. \n\nIn my opinion, your forgiveness still wasn\u2019t something you needed to give Neil, but it will lead to a healthier step forward in your relationship. \n\n\nAs for your father, I am so terribly sorry. Your excitement to reunite with your father turned to dust in your hands when he used you living with him as a ploy to marry you off. I can\u2019t even begin to imagine how that would feel. Your happiness now is something that you have despite what your father did, not because of it. You had to work HARD for your happiness, don\u2019t let him take any of that credit. \n\nYour father is the one who put you in the situation.

Arranged marriage may still be a practice in parts of the world but it is a fundamentally inhuman thing to do.\n\nEDIT: Realized I didn't explain the rest. OP is the AH because yes, she is keeping both of these men to very different standards, is actively trying to fix only one of the two relationships, and seems to have made this decision at least partially because of the 'practicality' of what her husband can provide her with.", "ESH\n\nBut I guess maybe you might make this work.", "NTA. But your husband is. I hope you can get away from all of these toxic men.", "I know you now love your husband. But if a friend told me what you\u2019ve written out here I would be offering her a place to stay for as long as she needed. This is horrific, and honestly I think what your husband did is worst. He *lied* to you. He wanted you because you were a pretty 18 year old. \n\nI understand wanting to stay cause you have no money. So if you don\u2019t want to leave now, try to find a job, and lock down your birth control. Don\u2019t let your husband know you have it.

Like, OP can do whatever they want but Neil\u2019s part in this is really predatory and creepy.\n\nShe\u2019s pretty so he offers to have her forcefully married to him, and then pretends to be in the same position to build her trust essentially just for his own benefit\u2026idk that would almost disturb me MORE than what the dad did (both are fucked up tho)", "Please note that an arranged marriage is when two WILLING people enter a marriage with prospects that were primarily selected by their families.

They did end up moving to her parents' and we saw each other toward the end of high school. She had two kids before she was 21. Never figured out if they were concerned about the family's reputation after the details of the tragedy became known, if they needed the dowry to cover expenses associated with the tragedy or if they were worried that not marrying young was how the tragedy befell the older sister... but yeah, not a great life to be a teenager in an arranged marriage \ud83d\ude2c", "Well, it's been only three years since she was forced to marry by her father.

It sounds like a major reason you've forgiven your husband is because you're financially dependent on him. It also sounds like you haven't actually forgiven him, but you've transferred all your anger to your dad. You have every right to be angry. But your husband was wrong to do this. You were still a teenager; he was an independent adult who knew exactly what he was doing. He lied to you and manipulated you for years. He would have kept lying if you hadn't caught him. He lied because he knew it was wrong but he was selfish; he didn't care. He was happy to take away your choice in the matter, just as much as your father was, because they both got what they wanted with no consideration for what you wanted.

He effing bought you. Lied to you and robbed you of your youth and freedom because he wanted someone like you to mold into his perfect little wife. Wtf. That's not healthy. You need to leave now.

These men have manipulated you and cut you off from any kind of independence, and making your own choices is the first step to finding yourself in the midst of it. \n\nI think it makes sense to have kinder feelings for your husband than your dad. Your dad is the instigator of this entire conflict; if he could\u2019ve just been chill, you wouldn\u2019t have had to marry anyone. There are varying degrees of social pressure involved here, and it seems likely that you could have easily married someone much worse. He lied to you, but he also put a ton of work into that lie and into connecting with you. It feels special to be chosen, and it feels special to have someone who knows where you\u2019re at and how you\u2019re feeling.\n\nIn the matters of the heart, there is no such thing as fairness.

Your husband has never been in the dark about your marriage but lied that he was, he supports you cutting off family members, you have no source of income as seen as you said he paid for your flight and have no savings.
