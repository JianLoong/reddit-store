Up until a few weeks ago, I thought he was also forced to marry me. He asked me to find some pictures off his old phone and I found messages between him, his father and my father around 6 months before the wedding where they were discussing the wedding. I had only been told 2 weeks before and was led to believe that he had too. Instead, he knew atleast 6 months in advance and that when my dad had told his friends and family that he planned to marry me off, my husband actually offered himself up as the groom because he thought I was attractive.\n\nNaturally, I was heartbroken. When Neil and I were newlyweds, I was a wreck. He was so patient and kind and we bonded over us both being forced into the relationship which I found out now is a lie. He provides for me completely, regularly buys me gifts and is in general a very loving partner to me. He also put me in therapy for my unresolved mental health issues from my teenaged years. I felt completely betrayed and he apologised to me profusely. He paid for my flight to go and stay with my brother because I wanted space and after some consideration, I decided to let it go. I know my decision sounds ridiculous, but I can't change the past and I'm happy now regardless of what happened. For practical reasons, it also wouldn't make sense for me to leave him because I'm still a student and I don't have any savings. We began counselling and have been making a lot of progress.\n\nMy father and I had a very difficult relationship and when he forced me to marry Neil, I was actually supposed to be living with him for university. I had previously been with my mother and her husband and the environment was hellish, so I was extremely excited to move in with my dad after years of us not speaking, it was all actually a ploy to marry me off. I didn't speak to him for a few months after the wedding (Neil fully supported me) but I eventually forgave him because Neil turned out to be the perfect partner. Now that I found out that my dad actively deceived me into believing Neil was also forced into the marriage, I've decided I no longer want a relationship with him.\n\nI called him today after avoiding him for a few weeks and told him that I knew the truth, and that I no longer wanted to speak to him. I also told him that I had chosen to forgive Neil and we were going to work through it together. He said that I was being unfair as I was letting Neil off but choosing to undo all the work I did on my relationship with him. He also said that since I'm happy now, I have no right to punish him for 'making me happy' (forcing the marriage and I had no right to let Neil off for the same thing.\n\nAITA for choosing to cut my dad off but forgiving my husband for the same thing?", "created_utc": 1675362498, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10rwwnr/aita_for_forgiving_my_husband_but_punishing_my/", "score": 37, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

At least both the fathers were transparent about their role and choice but your husband pretended and trauma bonded with you when he is a grown ass man taking a girl as his wife when he was willing and you were forced. Way above Reddit pay grade. Please seek more counseling for yourself.", "Nta because you are a victim, it's seems a completely horrible situation and I can't believe you've forgiven a man for forcing you into marriage and lying to you, I hope your therapist can make you see how sick that is. Maybe it's some form of Stockholm syndrome. Has your husband had any therapy for his horrific actions? Has he owned up to how sick what he did was?", "ESH. They **both deceived** you. I'm glad your husband is nice to you and treats you well, but he wanted to marry you because he thought you were attractive and wanted to bed you. He supports you cutting off your dad because that's one less person in your life. Don't be surprised if Neil marries off your daughter if you have one because if he's ok **deceiving you into marriage**, he'll have no problem doing it to your daughter.

Still, forcing you into marriage is an asshole move. Not realizing that your husband actually committed the bigger wrong here by lying to you and using your \u201cshared\u201d trauma to bond with you makes you an asshole. He manipulated you to the highest order, and is significantly worse than your father. No idea how you can ever trust him at all.", "Esh they both deceived you so if you forgive one you should forgive the other for this problem with that said I believe you may be taking out anger you feel about him forcing the marriage on you and him only telling you 2 weeks before if you want to go no contact with him over that I would say Nta but that\u2019s not why you went no contact and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s fair to forgive one but not the other if you wanted to go NC you should\u2019ve done it for other reasons and you would\u2019ve had every right for those reasons that\u2019s like of you have 2 children and they lie to you are you just going to forgive one when they both did wrong", "NTA.  However, it sounds like you're trying to explain this decision like it is rational. \nIt isn't.   How you feel is valid and you can do whatever feels right to you, but realistically, your husband F'd up much more than your father in this specific situation.", "NTA Your father had no right to keep that information from you. It was your future at stake, and he couldn't possibly have known that it would end up to be a happy marriage. You could have just as easily ended up miserable. What's more, I don't think you're letting your husband off. It sounds like he worked very hard to earn your trust and forgiveness after you found out about everything, but your father hasn't done a thing. Just because he's your father, that doesn't mean you *have* to forgive him.", "Nta. Your husband unlike your father is working to build that trust back up. Your father had no way to know they this marriage would be a happy safe one. I'm glad it is but it very well could have been the opposite.", "NTA. Im surprised you forgave Neil. But he does soubd supper supportive and no that youre hapoy its easier to forgive him. Your dad was in the wrong from the start.

For your sanity's sake, go no contact with your father and continue enjoying the man who cherishes you.

Makes sense to me.", "NTA. It took a lot from you to forgive Neil. But you've also have built a reasonable relationship with him, given the circumstances of your marriage. I'm surprised by that, but I also recognize that I'm not as forgiving as most. \n\nYour father and him made the decisions on your future without your input, it was unfair and it was not right. Neil to me has been trying to make things right, but with the situation he has a long way to go still. The difference is he is trying and your father is not. \n\nYou are a adult. Your father forced you into a adult situation when you were not ready. You can now make the adult choices to restrict contact with your father. Neil is not innocent in this situation either, but as I have stated above, it is your choice to forgive him.", "NTA- you are in a position to be much more empathetic with your husband than you are your father.

As I'm going to guess your husband helping you find the therapists you need, he may also be also be sideline directing the therapy you receive. You were 18 to his 26 when you married, that is not to old for subtle grooming, you said he got you help for your trauma in your teens, it would not be unusual for a therapist to encourage you to \"lean on the strength of the man you have no\" and for him to shower you in gifts and support so you could see how much better life is with him as opposed to before. \n\nThis doesn't mean he is necessarily a bad person or a bad man, just it can be done with very creepy intentions or with good intentions. Intentions matter. He saw you and thought you were attractive and said yes I would like to marry her. Keep in mind, it  could have been someone FAR WORSE your father was going to marry you off regardless. That doesn't mean you are stuck if this one goes bad. You are strong. Finish school and keep a backup plan handy.  I would just be careful going forward, as someone else mentioned he may pass on the forced marriage idea down to your daughters when you have them.", "ESH, except you.\n\nYou are the victim, so whatever you decide is correct. The whole situation is above reddits paygrade.", "ESH \n\nYour husband and your father are both guilty of forcing you into this relationship. It\u2019s truly despicable.\n\n> For practical reasons, it also wouldn't make sense for me to leave him because I'm still a student and I don't have any savings.\n\nI\u2019m sorry, but you do sound like an hypocrite for giving your husband a pass because he\u2019s taking care and providing for you. You\u2019re completely glossing over the fact that he manipulated over your \u201cshared trauma\u201d to make you fall in love with him.\n\nTake a minute to reflect about the kind of message you\u2019re sending to your husband by giving him a pass. You\u2019re essentially telling him that it\u2019s fine for him to deceive and manipulate you as long as he\u2019ll provide for you.", "NTA.

You can choose to feel however you want about whoever you want. And there is nothing wrong with making the best of a bad thing.", "NTA.  Every situation is different.  If your happy and he treats you well, congratulations and good luck.  People have forgiven far worse.    Your father has much more of an obligation to see to your safety and well-being than this guy did at the time of your marriage.      You owe your father nothing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGood luck.", "NTA but everyone else is.\n\nYour choices are extremely hard.

I cannot imagine the emotional toll that takes on a person or the effects that it has on your sense of self. The struggles you are going through are completely valid. \n\nWith the fact that your husband chose to marry you based on appearance, I can see how this would now undermine every experience you\u2019ve had with him in the past. He lied to you, or actively deceived you for 3 years. And I don\u2019t like the age difference at all knowing that you were forced into this. He was 25, and you were 18. It\u2019s not uncommon.. but it\u2019s something to keep in mind. \n\nHowever..\n\nReading what you have provided and given the situation you\u2019ve been put in, it is a relief to see how accommodating your husband is being with your healing process. It really does sound like he genuinely cares about your mental health and your well being. \n\nSomeone who only loves you only for your appearance may not take the risk of sending you far away to a family member where they can\u2019t watch over your decisions or influence how you feel about the information you\u2019ve been given. He\u2019s letting you handle this how you want to handle it. \n\nIn my opinion, your forgiveness still wasn\u2019t something you needed to give Neil, but it will lead to a healthier step forward in your relationship. \n\n\nAs for your father, I am so terribly sorry. Your excitement to reunite with your father turned to dust in your hands when he used you living with him as a ploy to marry you off. I can\u2019t even begin to imagine how that would feel. Your happiness now is something that you have despite what your father did, not because of it. You had to work HARD for your happiness, don\u2019t let him take any of that credit. \n\nYour father is the one who put you in the situation. He is the one to blame. \n\nYou have a good head on your shoulders OP. Again, NTA.", "ESH. Your husband (you were forced to marry) and father (who forced the marriage) are very obviously assholes.

Arranged marriage may still be a practice in parts of the world but it is a fundamentally inhuman thing to do.", "ESH\n\nBut I guess maybe you might make this work.", "NTA. But your husband is. I hope you can get away from all of these toxic men.", "I know you now love your husband. But if a friend told me what you\u2019ve written out here I would be offering her a place to stay for as long as she needed. This is horrific, and honestly I think what your husband did is worst. He *lied* to you. He wanted you because you were a pretty 18 year old. \n\nI understand wanting to stay cause you have no money. So if you don\u2019t want to leave now, try to find a job, and lock down your birth control. Don\u2019t let your husband know you have it. Because I have a big feeling that you will find yourself pregnant soon after you graduate.", "NTA because you feel the way you feel and no one is owed forgiveness (or owed a duty to not be forgiven?). But I think you should talk to a neutral therapist about this. In time, you may have changing feelings about your husband and how you were deceived. It\u2019s ok for feelings to change with time.", "Right? Like I\u2019m glad she feels happy now but like\u2026it\u2019s because he manipulated it that way. Like, OP can do whatever they want but Neil\u2019s part in this is really predatory and creepy.\n\nShe\u2019s pretty so he offers to have her forcefully married to him, and then pretends to be in the same position to build her trust essentially just for his own benefit\u2026idk that would almost disturb me MORE than what the dad did (both are fucked up tho)", "Please note that an arranged marriage is when two WILLING people enter a marriage with prospects that were primarily selected by their families.

She was matter of fact about it, she would not be legally his wife since she was a minor but she would have to transfer schools because it was going to ruin the match if she wanted to stay with her parents and have her husband move in there. They did end up moving to her parents' and we saw each other toward the end of high school. She had two kids before she was 21. Never figured out if they were concerned about the family's reputation after the details of the tragedy became known, if they needed the dowry to cover expenses associated with the tragedy or if they were worried that not marrying young was how the tragedy befell the older sister... but yeah, not a great life to be a teenager in an arranged marriage \ud83d\ude2c", "Well, it's been only three years since she was forced to marry by her father.

I won't imply you need to take any action that you aren't comfortable with, but it's seriously imperative you look at these behaviors and do not let them continue if you'd like to stay with this man, as he IS a known deceiver. He will likely continue to be duplicitous.\n\nDo you have any friends to talk to? Does he have contact with your mental health team? Do you have anywhere safe to turn?
