As a grad student myself I barely have enough money to cover bills, and hardly enough time to even go on a date with my partner once a month. \n\nI would need to save for months to afford even a small wedding gift. I'm 100% sure she would have had to make an effort to put aside time to be there for you. \n\nIf my new SIL had a shower (I don't even see the point in these jeez) and I saved my precious little time to be there with her, and then she complained that I didn't spend enough money on her, well let's say I certainly would be hurt and much less inclined to spend the little I have in the wedding, nevermind have a close relationship with someone who has so little empathy.", "YTA. Gifts and cards from ANYONE are optional.", "YTA - gifts are always optional.  Yes, they are nice to receive but you cannot demand.  Could it be that she is just planning a larger wedding gift and is just waiting to give it to the both of you.  Or it could also be that since y\u2019all have been together so long, is there really anything you need?\nWedding gifts were to help the young couple out their own house together not for luxury items or cash for honeymoon.", "YTA. She has the opportunity to get you a gift for the wedding. And also you've received gifts from other people so it's definitely not that serious. You're just being greedy at this point. Bridal showers shouldn't even be a thing IMO since people are already getting gifts for the wedding. It's just another excuse to get people to spend money unnecessarily", "Back when I was a bride, and my friends were brides, we never expected to be gifting each other wedding gifts. We were all in our twenties, and just starting out, so we invited each other to our weddings, but didn\u2019t expect gifts from each other, unless it was something small. Our showers were small, too, and mostly focused on getting together with some finger foods and a few lingerie purchases that most of us would collaborate on to get nicer things while spending less per person. In a million years we never would have expected anything from each other\u2014especially if we were still in school. This was the late 90\u2019s to early 2000\u2019s.\n\nNowadays, it seems as though friends are treated so poorly, and the expectations of people who have barely entered adulthood and who are still struggling to get established are insane. For you to be upset over this is ridiculous and shows poor manners. I think it is a shame that you are willing to start a relationship with her by whining about what you feel you are due. YTA", "Yes. Keep it zipped. Not worth it.", "YTA. Why do so many women think they\u2019re the only woman in the world to get married and should be treated like a queen? Have a word with yourself. You should just enjoy spending your bridal shower with your friends and not expect any gifts.", "There is absolutely no way you can word this question to her without sounding entitled, spoiled, bratty and yes YWBTA. There could be any number of reasons why she didn\u2019t bring anything for your bridal shower, she may be ordering something or bringing something to the wedding, who knows? But I can guarantee if you ask you\u2019ll come across as a nit picky judgemental bridezilla no matter how nice you word it and she\u2019ll tell everyone and everyone will think the same thing.", "YTA, seriously, reread what you just wrote and give your head a wobble!", "YWBTA if you said anything. She may be waiting until she has funds for a wedding gift. Don\u2019t stir the pot in your soon-to-be family. Let it go.", "YWBTA, that's tacky as hell. I just got married this year and I couldn't tell you who didn't gift us something. Are you logging this information in an excel or something? Jesus.\n\nYou receive what you receive and you don't make a scene.", "If she's in grad school, maybe she can't afford a gift and forgot to grab a card. Maybe she figured she'll just give you a card later or it wasn't important or she's saving up for a gift. Maybe she's just planning on a wedding gift and figured she'd not bother with two.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t have to be a snub and expecting a gift from everyone is a little entitled. I have a lot of people to give Christmas gifts this year. Some people just aren't getting some. I work minimum wage and can't afford it. Doesn't mean I don't love them, but I have to prioritise like its my godson's first Christmas so obviously I want to prioritise him.\n\nYTA just let it go", "To be honest, I couldn\u2019t nor thought about who did or didn\u2019t gift us anything. Weddings have stopped being about what\u2019s important and more of a way of getting gifts and money. Honestly, it\u2019s ridiculous and I wish people were still using manners but for many I don\u2019t see that happening any more.", "YTA. Why isn\u2019t her being present and supportive enough for you? Why do you need something tangible?", "YTA. Stop being petty and money/gift grabbing.\n\nThe end.", "YWBTA.  Let it go.  It is important to learn which battles are important and which you should walk away from.  Give her the benefit of the doubt in your mind and let it go.  It doesn't ever deserve to be brought up, okay?  Your fianc\u00e9 is correct.", "YTA gifts are obligatory and not a requirement.  No cards?  Why so it can be shoved in a box and forgotten about?  I cleaned out my office and tossed ALL my cards from weddings birthdays exc.  90 percent of cards you get is two tiny sentences and there signature.  Big whoppdidoo!", "YTA. Babe...nobody else cares about your wedding.", "I'd say...just the fact you are entertaining the though makes you some what entitled. NOW....if you proceed with the confrontation, that would definitely put you in A/H territory. Not every body is in a position to give, and if the relation ship is some what starting to become more closer than befor, this would certainly destroy what little progress has been made and possibly cause some unwanted friction with other family members...over material gifts??!! Please don't become one more statistic on this and possibly other subreddits like r/bridezilla among others....congrats on the wedding!", "So petty. YTA", "YTA. But also, could it be possible someone mistakenly left her name off a group gift? Often people do group/family gifts and a small mistake could have happen. And if not, get over if it and don\u2019t be greedy.", "YTA\n\n\nI had people attend my wedding that didn't buy a gift..... And do you want to know my reaction? \"Yay! You made it it! Thank you so much for BEING HERE for our special day!\"  ..... Them being there to share the moment was enough!", "YTA. Drop it and keep peace. You plan on a long and happy Marriage. It may come with some issues in the family. Pick what's important.", "Ew. YTA, green ass.", "Yes YTA if you bring it up or make this an issue cuz it's not an issue at all. Are you only getting married for the gifts?\n\nWhen did gifts become the expectation? If someone wants to gift you, be grateful. Stop being so entitled.", "I wish you had shown your husband this side of you before he walked down the aisle\nYTA", "Yes. Confronting her would make YTA. While invites to showers and weddings are expected to sent to family, gifts for each and every every event that gift might be customary are NOT to be expected of those who may attend more than one or two events. \nQuite often a sister or mother will be invited to shower given the by MOH, one that the girls the bride works with give,  a separate Wedding Shower, depending on where you live this pretty common. Often, the family members give one large at the wedding.\nEven if this weren't  the case, it's NEVER ok to bring up the lack of a gift. Maybe she's a whole more tighter on money than expected. Maybe she's planning on surprising you with you something that she didn't want everyone to know about until both you and your SO are together. Whatever the reason, it doesn't seam to about you, so let it go.", "Yes- you would be. No one is REQUIRED to \u2018gift\u2019 anyone anything- even a card.", "YTA", "YTA and greedy! No one owes you a gift, you're behaving like a spoiled child.", "Yes, YWBTAH if you asked. Maybe she has put all her funds into one \u201cbig\u201d gift at the wedding rather than multiple less expensive gifts at each event.She doesn\u2019t \u201cOWE\u201d you anything, even if you never receive a wedding gift from her. It would be in very bad taste if you were to bring it up. It\u2019s your husband\u2019s family so any inquiries should be handled  by him alone.", "YTA:: privileged bride to be behavior", "YTA. She doesn\u2019t OWE you anything and she\u2019s in grad school. She probably can\u2019t afford it", "YWBTA\nYour attitude is very shallow, immature, and materialistic.  Don't you dare say a word to anyone about this.  The only person who will look bad is you, if you do that.  Let it go.  Get to know her.  You may end up gaining a sister and lifelong friend.  If you say anything, there is no taking it back, and it will never be forgotten.  It's  not worth it.  If you go there,  you won't gain anything, and you will lose the chance of ever having a good relationship with her.", "Debacle??? You must have had an easy life up until now.\n\nYTA.", "YTA. You aren\u2019t entitled to a damn thing, so leave her alone.", "Yta", "Yta. I bet drama follows you like a tick on a dog. In what way does confronting her about some imaginary slight benefit anyone involved? This will only end in disaster and you know it.", "YWBTA. I\u2019m with you, I would also be annoyed and thinking about it. But it\u2019s just not worth it. Don\u2019t do it.", "No, you wouldn't be an asshole. If it truly hurt your feelings, there's nothing wrong with expressing that. But maybe consider replacing \"confrontation\" in your mind with a \"healthy conversation\". Look up non violent communication, it might help.", "Esh", "NTA just because you said a card was enough. You shouldn\u2019t expect expensive gifts, sometimes people can\u2019t buy them. But if your only looking for the recognition, like a congratulations card, then I think you\u2019re fine.", "Do not ask her. However when/if she ever has a bridal\nShower feel free to not give her anything either.", "NAH It depends on tradition.\nI was not able to find a wedding gift from my brother. So I was asking him, how it looks like. His gift was in a wrong box.", "I suppose it would be safe to say that her card must have been misplaced at the shower and you felt awful about it, as you were doing a memories box and it would have been a treasured addition. Judge her reaction to that. No confrontation accomplished.", "While I can understand being upset over a lack of gift/card, she was there and honestly is this the way you wanna start off officially being a family? Yes YTA for wanting to start something over this.", "This \u00d7100. Please don't become the bride that demands gifts of people. That Reddit page is already so full.", "You don't mention that she seems to have expected a bridal shower gift **in addition** to a wedding present, which is... just wow", "Fr who needs a card to say congrats, when she\u2019s there in person congratulating and celebrating you!", "Exactly. See what happens at the wedding, the actual important thing, and judge accordingly", "Gender reveals are the worst. Makes my toes curl", "THIS^^^", "Agreed. A card is nice but a gift is never required. It's also really hard to imagine a way to ask this without coming across as crass and materialistic. \"I noticed there was no gift from you at the shower. Did you forget, or were you not giving a gift?\" sounds rude and puts pressure on the other person, who may not be in a position to give", "Yeah that\u2019s a quick way to blow up her relationship with her future in-laws. One seemingly simple question could really sour their relationship. If FSIL is in grad school, she\u2019s broke and stressed. The fact that she even made it to the shower, not even the wedding but the shower, is her gift. She took time she could have otherwise been using to study, catch up on sleep, catch up on chores, during the most stressful part of her semester (finals are right around the corner), to show up for OP and her fianc\u00e9. \n\nOP, gift are nice, but the older you get the more you realize that simply showing up is the best gift anyone can really give you. When people die, when you need to move, when you are celebrating a wedding or birth, showing up counts. And the more crap you have going on in your life, the harder it gets to show up, but you do it for the people you love. I have three kids right now. If I show up for something I have moved heaven and earth to do so. Be grateful she was there.\n\nGifts and money are not entry fees paid to attend life events. You invite the people you love to celebrate with you as your way to thank them for being in your life. For filing your days with friendship, love, and laughter, and helping you when your days are filled with illness and loss. You do not charge them for being part of your life.", "This is what I was thinking. If the future SIL helped throw the shower, that\u2019s the gift.", "Since gifts are never required, no, it\u2019s not tacky.", "It\u2019s not tacky to not give a gift, gifts aren\u2019t owed\u2026", "This doesn\u2019t matter in absence of a card, the bare minimum.", "I mean...that's normal\n\n(OP still WBTA)", "It really does when you are poor, a nice card could mean a night without supper. \n\nA nice card is 10+ dollars where I live. a dollar store card would seem obviously cheap compared to the nicer ones she would get and I'm sure OP would bring that up to her as well. \n\nSo it DOES matter actually.", "No. This is standard for a small subset of a fraction of the worlds population. Not \u2018normal\u2019", "Then OP would automatically be the asshole. It\u2019s also clear she isn\u2019t destitute.  A card is a bare minimum.  Honestly, it should be THE gift as the actual valuable gift should come at the wedding but idk I\u2019m a dude I don\u2019t know about bridal showers.", "I\u2019ve never even heard of a bridal shower before today, but I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s one of the countless events the US wedding industry has invented to sell more crap. Yeah, that\u2019s not normal.", "Google it", "I see no indication besides her being a grad student. As an undergraduate student I know what it's like to not be able to get a gift for a sister on a special occasion. Students aren't usually well off, grad students are underpaid and over worked. \ud83d\ude44", "They aren't even that common in the US anymore. A relative of mine got married to a woman in the early or mid 90s and I remember her having one. But none of the other women I know who have gotten married since ~2000 have. One friend of mine had a combined engagement/bridal/groom party, but it wasn't a shower. They just served food and desserts they both liked, and it was a way for people involved in the wedding to meet each other. It was pretty cool.", "I Googled it and just in 2 minutes found that at least the UK and France don\u2019t do bridal showers.

It would be something I wanna do with people I wanna do it with. I also know people won\u2019t be able to attend all of them, heck maybe I just have one big one I have no idea. It\u2019s unthinkable to me how people expect to have everyone attend all these parties and gift at all the parties too. Their attendance is gift enough", "Obviously I meant for cultures that do participate in bridal showers. I'm not saying the whole world approaches weddings in the same way, that would be ridiculous.", "Doesn\u2019t UK have hen dos for just the bride and women. I feel like that\u2019s the same idea as bridal shower.", "Yes, I had multiple showers before I married. Of course, I\u2019m old so when I got married a caveman had just invented fire & Moby Duck was just a minnow. \ud83d\ude02", "In my culture we do have bridal showers but you only give one gift.
