{"id": 31648, "submission_id": "18305b1", "title": "AITA for not following traditions in thanksgiving?", "selftext": "Hi! I am using a throwaway for this one as my husband knows about my main.\n\nSo to start this off, I (27f) have been dating my husband (34m) since 2018, we got married three years into our relationship (2021) and things have been going extremely well. We have spent four years of thanksgivings at my parents house, this was the first time we choose to spend it at his parents house.\n\nWhen we got there, my MIL, her mother and both my sister in laws were in the kitchen all helping each other with food. Me and my husband went in there and talked for a bit. My MIL asked me if I would like to help out, I said \u201cnot right now, would it be okay if I come back soon and help out a bit?\u201d. She very nicely said it was totally fine and told me and my husband to get us something to drink and hang out with the men and kids. My husband gave me a nasty look and said \u201cYou\u2019re not even going to help?\u201d. His mother said that they were more than enough people and she just asked me in case I wanted to help with the cooking, but that they all managed just fine. He grabbed a beer for only himself and went to the living room, I did the same and followed after.\n\nI ended up helping them with setting up everything on the table as I wanted to help out just a bit. His mother did not ask me to do this, neither did my SIL\u2019s. Dinner went extremely well, we talked a lot and I really like his family.\n\nWhen we and husband got in the car he started mumbling really angrily at me, I asked him about three times what he was saying before he blew up at me. He told me that it is their tradition that the women are in the kitchen cooking, that I disrespect his mom in her own house by acting so entitled. We ended up having an argument about this whole thing and he has not stopped insisting on that his mother in fact is offended by this. I have not talked to her about this, she did not tell me anything about being offended either. But I know his mom is a really nice woman who would never want to say anything bad about someone, so I am starting to think that maybe I really disrespected his mom and she just don\u2019t have the heart to tell me.\n\nSo AITA for not following their traditions? I feel like I was an asshole because helping out would not have been that hard, and had I known the outcome I would have just stayed and helped out.\n\nEdit: I don\u2019t know if this will help my case, but I am working as a nurse and had just come from a 18 hour shift and directly went to MIL\u2019s house, hence why I was not that keen on helping out with dinner. I could not get the day off. Don\u2019t know if that is even relevant or not, it is just like my reasoning behind this.", "created_utc": 1700854697, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18305b1/aita_for_not_following_traditions_in_thanksgiving/", "score": 1500, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

First of all, as a host I would NEVER, EVER ask a guest to help me. I am hosting. If they offer, I may take them up on it. But asking a guest to help out, and especially not something quick like \"oh you're going to the living room, could you take this plate of apps with you?\" That just feels tacky. And OP didn't even say she wouldn't help at all, just that she didn't want to immediately.\n\nSecond, its a sexist fucking tradition. \"It' tradition that the women do all the work while the men sit around!

Guests can offer to help. Guests should not be ASKED to help. Guests should especially not be asked to help based solely on their gender. NTA. I'm so annoyed that I can't remember if this was a boyfriend or a husband, but whichever, he's the asshole. You are not required to show up as a guest to a meal after an 18hr shift and keep on working while the super special people with penises sit around and play with them.", "NTA but all the men in your husband's family are.

Tell your husband you will help as much as he does.", "NTA just because misogyny is a \u201ctradition\u201d doesn\u2019t make it right.

If they feel all woman who enter become staff and the men are guests\u2026I\u2019d stay with my family for the holidays.  I\u2019m sure your family haven't been using him as the help for the past 4 Thanksgivings.", "You tell your husband he can fuck right off with his toxic male sexism, and he's not a toddler, he's perfectly capable of helping his mother.\n\nSeriously, this is some Stepford Wives bullshit, how can you come here asking if you're the asshole? How can you be with a man like that?", "NTA, having gender specific traditions like this one are stupid.", "I've seen variations of this exact thing before. But I can totally believe it's normal in some families to just expect the women to all be involved in the kitchen on thanksgiving, while the men just drink beer.\n\nSo many 'traditions' are horribly sexist. NTA", "yeah this is just blatant misogyny. if he thought there werent enough hands in the kitchen he couldve gone and helped. but MAN drink BEER while WOMAN do KITCHEN. pathetic. and you just got off a shift??? tell your husband if he needs traditional gender roles in his life, he can make 100% of the money and you can chill at home baking pies. nta", "NTA. Don\u2019t have a kid with him. This is going downhill from here.", "NTA... just getting off an 18 hr shift is relevant. Not everyone has the stamina to start cooking after that. \n\nYour husband can lead by example. He could go in, wash his hands and ask how he could help. \n\nOr do all the men send the Ladys off to drink after dinner so that the can clear the table, put the food away. Do the dishes and clean the kitchen. Then serve dessert?", "I absolutely despise these 'traditions'. So the women do ALL the work while then men sit around and do sweet eff all? I would be livid with my husband for expecting this of me and his overall selfish and misogynistic behaviour. They can all suck it if this is their expectation.", "NTA.\n\nIf they expect you to follow their traditions if you go there for holidays, guess what - *you don't have to follow their sexist traditions if you don't ever go again*.  Problem solved!", "I would bet dollars to donuts his mom didn\u2019t even notice or give half of a shit and it wasn\u2019t anywhere near the big deal to her that it was to him. I\u2019ve seen situations like this before and the mom looks at the son like he\u2019s got 17 heads and wonders where the hell he got the idea that it was required that the women help out. A lot of times these traditions just develop out of standard sexist behavior, but it\u2019s never actually been something enforced or even expected\u2026 and then you find somebody of your husband\u2018s generation who thinks it **is** enforced, to the point that not doing it is considered disrespectful. So stupid.\n\nI would strongly doubt that his mom was upset. Because we live in a sexist society, most women that are old enough to have children who are married grew up with the idea that you absolutely positively do not allow a guest to help you. You can ask them if they would like to help as a social convention, but you were supposed to give them some incredibly light and low-key task. The flipside of this is that you are supposed to ask the host if they want you to help them and they are supposed to tell you \u201cabsolutely not\u201d even though they actually wouldn\u2019t mind some help clearing the table and putting dishes away.\n\nIn none of these scenarios is blowing up at someone and blathering about disrespect part of the deal. I feel like this man has been engaging in the consumption of some toxic masculinity material. I just asked my husband to see if I was sounding like a paranoid conclusion jumper, and he also says it sounds like the guy has been taking in  toxic masculinity BS. Note: my husband is nearly 60 and has gotten into three fistfights as part of his work in the last six months and builds AR-15s as a hobby. If **that** guy is saying your dude smells like toxic masculinity? You got a problem.", "Nta did he get up and help? No? Then why tf would you?  Thats not a tradition, thats sexism in play.", "NTA. Since this is your first time at his parents they might have asked if you wanted to help to include you so you have the option to join in if you want. You didn\u2019t want to but I proooobably would have mentioned that you just got off an 18 hour shift at work so you wanted to rest for just a bit but you\u2019d be back to help if that\u2019s ok. That way his mom would have known you\u2019re not just like nah I don\u2019t what to help, thanks. Either way if there are any traditions for holidays your husband should have told you beforehand. How the hell are you supposed to know? And IF his mom IS upset, it\u2019s his job to defend you. To let her know you had a long shift at work and just needed a minute and that HE is the one who didn\u2019t tell you anything about traditions etc. not to berate you for not knowing what he didn\u2019t tell you.", "Why didn\u2019t you ask him why HE didn\u2019t go help instead?", "NTA. Your husband is though. I really don't think your mother in law was offended, pretty sure she knew you came off an 18 hour shift. Fuck that sexist tradition. Women do not need to be chained to the kitchen while the men relax, I bet the women still have to clean up too? Hard nope. And you did help out, with setting the table, what did your husband help with?\n\nIf you really feel guilty, message MIL to say sorry that you didn't know that the women cooking was their tradition, a d you hope you didn't offend her.\n\nIt's an apology, but not for not cooking. And tell your husband to warn you in advance next time there is a tradition you need to know about.", "Clearly NTA! He shouldn\u2019t have told you beforehand what the tradition was, instead of expecting you to just know. \n\nAlso, you don\u2019t need to justify why you didn\u2019t help at that moment! The way he behaved was completely unnecessary. He could have pulled you the the side that moment instead of being passive aggressive and  let it fester for so long. He needs to learn to communicate better.", "how dare you not follow a sexist, outdated, disrespectful tradition!  \nNTA but your husbands sexism and morals is showing", "INFO\nwhat is your dynamic at home? Does he expect you to fulfill the misogynistic stereotype of women and perform all household chores? Or is this just in front of the other men in his family? \n\nIf you perform all household chores, throw the man away\n\nIf this behavior is only at his family functions coupled with the way he blew up after would suggest huge insecurity issues.", "lord, the absolute doormats in this comment section. NTA. i think it\u2019s really tacky and impolite to ask guests to help out with cooking a holiday meal if you didn\u2019t ask them beforehand. like, *days* before. especially since she asked you, and not her dear son.", "NTA\n\nIf this tradition was so important to them, someone should have made that clear in advance. Can't be upset that you didn't meet an expectation you didn't know about. Many households don't want their guests to lift a finger..", "NTA\n\n> He told me that it is their tradition that the women are in the kitchen cooking\n\nThat\u2019s just sexism. Also you just got off an EIGHTEEN HOUR SHIFT?\n\nI do not have a high opinion of your husband right now. If his mom is offended, he should be defending you - not criticizing.\n\nAnd it\u2019s telling that he\u2019s not doing anything to change what is a very sexist \u201ctradition\u201d while benefitting from it, in that he isn\u2019t expected to help at all.\n\nIn my family everyone who is able helps in some way - including everyone brings a dish/food item. (and the family that opened their home does not do cleanup.)", "NTA. Women in the kitchen? What kind of tradition is that? And what do men do in that time?", "NTA. You know who could have prevented you from offending your mil?  Your husband who knew about the tradition. \n\nI assume Thanksgiving in your family is not \"women folk cook while the manly men sit around on their ass\"?\nSo he would have known that you wouldn't automatically jump in and help.", "NTA.  Tradition is turkey and stuffing; sexism is the women do all the work and the men drink and watch sports.  If you're friendly with your SILs, you might want to have a chat over coffee about this; I'll bet they're tired of the automatic assumption that they work, too. Solidarity in numbers.", "NTA.\n\nThis isn't a 'tradition'.  This is some outdated gender norm BS.

And you offered to come back later, so obviously the intent was there. An 18 hr shift? Your husband kinda sucks ngl.

Many of us in this age range are parents now, ourselves, and even those who are not are typically working much harder at this age than they were, but we're expected to carve the time out and use the gas and deal with the traffic and take the time off, etc.\n\nSo there's a lot of stress and expectation plopped right down on us, and too little clear and effective communication with families or partners to (hopefully) sort it out.\n\nNTA.

Definitely need a conversation where you ask him to be absolutely honest with what he expects of you as a person and a partner, 'cause he SURE seemed to have a completely unspoken expectation of you for Thanksgiving.

I am using a throwaway for this one as my husband knows about my main.\n\nSo to start this off, I (27f) have been dating my husband (34m) since 2018, we got married three years into our relationship (2021) and things have been going extremely well. We have spent four years of thanksgivings at my parents house, this was the first time we choose to spend it at his parents house.\n\nWhen we got there, my MIL, her mother and both my sister in laws were in the kitchen all helping each other with food. Me and my husband went in there and talked for a bit. My MIL asked me if I would like to help out, I said \u201cnot right now, would it be okay if I come back soon and help out a bit?\u201d. She very nicely said it was totally fine and told me and my husband to get us something to drink and hang out with the men and kids. My husband gave me a nasty look and said \u201cYou\u2019re not even going to help?\u201d. His mother said that they were more than enough people and she just asked me in case I wanted to help with the cooking, but that they all managed just fine. He grabbed a beer for only himself and went to the living room, I did the same and followed after.\n\nI ended up helping them with setting up everything on the table as I wanted to help out just a bit. His mother did not ask me to do this, neither did my SIL\u2019s. Dinner went extremely well, we talked a lot and I really like his family.\n\nWhen we and husband got in the car he started mumbling really angrily at me, I asked him about three times what he was saying before he blew up at me. He told me that it is their tradition that the women are in the kitchen cooking, that I disrespect his mom in her own house by acting so entitled. We ended up having an argument about this whole thing and he has not stopped insisting on that his mother in fact is offended by this. I have not talked to her about this, she did not tell me anything about being offended either. But I know his mom is a really nice woman who would never want to say anything bad about someone, so I am starting to think that maybe I really disrespected his mom and she just don\u2019t have the heart to tell me.\n\nSo AITA for not following their traditions? I feel like I was an asshole because helping out would not have been that hard, and had I known the outcome I would have just stayed and helped out.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If they offer, I might take up their offer, but it's my goal as the host to not need the help to begin with.\n\nThe other issue at hand here is also just the old traditional views of women belonging in the kitchen. I think everyone should be helping if it's going to be a joint effort, or at the very least offer to help regardless of gender.\n\nI'm going to say NTA. You did just come back from an 18 hour shift. I mean, who in their right mind would expect you to work an insanely long shift *and* also cook at that point? That's just mental. Especially when there were others (mostly dudes) who were just chilling, doing nothing, drinking beer. Were their days super taxing? One of them at the very least should be offering to help. Who cares if they have a penis instead?\n\nBut I would also encourage OP to look into the differences between ask and guess culture, because it looks like her and her husband come from different families in this case.

I have never seen anyone sided with the inlaws.", "No one, not a single person, has said that the husband isn\u2019t an absolute cock, or even that the gender divided labor is a good thing. But since she didn\u2019t say she came off an 18 hour shift at first- it\u2019s appalling to many of us who were raised with a certain type/level of manners towards our in-laws/elders that you would refuse to help and instead go drink beer. Also weird she didn\u2019t realize it was an offer to hang with the girls and chat and catch up more than get free labor. But that\u2019s completely different and has nothing to do with YTA/NTA", "OP is also a nurse and had just gotten off an 18 hour shift at work. I don't know if you've ever worked an 18 hour nursing shift.", "Aw thanks for reading. I felt bad after I posted about my tradition. I didn\u2019t want to hijack the post. But I did grew up in the Balkans which is still very \u2018men are men\u2019, \u2018women are women and belong in the kitchen\u2019 and I never experienced that growing up. Especially not from my parents. So growing up in a country with views like this I was kinda shocked to hear about young men that grew up in a more free country with views like this. If that makes sense", "u/roonilwazlibx It depends on the company, and sometimes the state the company is in,  as our laws can vary state to state. I am currently lucky enough to be with a company that is closed on Thanksgiving so we all are off that day.\n\nI previously worked in a big box retail store where the company said we  were \"off\" on Thanksgiving but your shift started on Friday  \"morning\" often just after midnight so no holiday pay.", ">towards our in-laws/elders that you would refuse to help and instead go drink beer\n\nYeah, it's weird her husband did that. And all the men in the house. Odd.", "This was my reaction, too. I don't care how long I've worked, if my MIL asked for help, I'd help. You know it won't be much and is likely being done to be inclusive. \n\nMy husband is pretty southern. I don't often have much in common with \"the wives\" but I'm an adult, so for the limit amount of time where I'm in these situations where it's evident this is the norm, I ask about their kids, jobs, planned vacations or upcoming events. I do it to be polite  and respectful to my husband's relationships and not wanting to make him uncomfortable. \n\nMy friend/family gatherings are not split like this so it doesn't come up for him, but he certainly has to make concessions when talking to my family and extended families because quite a few of them speak different languages. He does that for me and respect for my relationships. \n\nOPs husband absolutely should have handled this differently and doesn't get to be a jerk when he didn't bother to discuss this ahead of time. \n\nSo, NTA, but I do think there were probably some raised eyebrows when she declined to help. \n\nI'm sure any residual bad feelings could be fixed with a nice thank you card to the MIL for hosting thanksgiving, especially since OP says she's a nice lady!"]}
