You cannot logic yourself out of a sense of guilt and failure as great as that mother was feeling, not at the fucking funeral. The truth is that lots of times, there *was* something that could theoretically have been done. Sometimes people overlook the wrong thing, and realize later that they were capable of having prevented or at least altered the outcome, and no amount of \u201chow could you have known?\u201d is going to convince a parent that there was nothing they could have done when they *know* there was something they could have done. That\u2019s why it\u2019s best not to say that shit. Regardless of whether it is true, if they firmly believe they failed to save their child, and they\u2019re convinced that there had been signs which they could have potentially noticed, you aren\u2019t going to easily convince that person that there was nothing they could do, and they may feel far worse for even entering the idea that they couldn\u2019t have helped. Sometimes that guilt is something they just have to experience during the grieving process.
