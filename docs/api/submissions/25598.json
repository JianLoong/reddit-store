Toxic positivity. \n\nHow can positivity be toxic you ask? Let\u2019s explore! \n\nWe as a society have decided that uncomfortable feelings are bad.

I have severe hydrocephaly that wasn\u2019t even caught until 2006. They always suspected I had it. But I didn\u2019t have the overly large head. I have cerebral palsy, but I am a fully functioning adult who can, do a lot of things. But my doctors are calling it a miracle because I should not be able to walk or talk with the way my brain looks. I do have some trouble walking, but I can definitely talk, lol.
