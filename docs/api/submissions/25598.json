Trying to explain to them that the situation is just a natural part of life is upsetting because it trivializes their grief. The parents are attempting to make sense of this horrible loss and you have the hubris to think you can explain it to them.  You know nothing of their intense pain so don't condescend them with platitudes. \n\nHonestly, sometimes social nuances are tricky to navigate, so I hope this helps provide clarity because you are probably pretty confused reading through all these comments.", "What does it even mean to say it was meant to be?? Do you believe every single thing in life is preordained? Most people don't. And even if everything *is* preordained, that doesn't take away the pain of a shitty thing.", "be so fr right now. i feel like your response tells me everything and even if the overall judgement ends up being YTA you probably won\u2019t even acknowledge or accept it.", "No. It's not meant to be that a parent overlives their child. That's the very opposite of what it's biologically meant to be. It's call progeny for a reason.", "INFO: have you ever lost someone extremely close to you? \n\nTelling anyone their death was meant to be is one of the WORST things you can ever say to someone. I lost my mom a year ago and I still remember some of the bullshit that people said and I will likely remember that for my entire life and there is no real forgiveness for some of what was said. You basically said \u201coh well it\u2019s a good thing your kid died now instead of later\u201d", "Seriously do you have the social skills of a wooden spoon? I mean can you honestly think that is a good/comforting thing to say to someone? YTA and I think you should apologise and just steer clear of your friend until they approach you because they will remember that remark and highly likely will not want to be friends with you.", "you don't see the problem with telling someone \"the worst moment in your life was supposed to happen\"?", "And hw  is this comforting?\n\n\nIt's devestating! Even if it might be true  (from your perspective), it's not comforting at all. It is soul-crushing to a grieving parent.", "Just so you know on earth you don\u2019t say that to a parent who lost their child.", "You rock", "\" you were only ment to borrow them, it was time he took her back\"", "Also never say that to a special needs parent, or someone caring for an elderly or sick parent", "It\u2019s a slap in the face, really. They should have kept their clich\u00e9 remarks to themselves. So sorry for your loss.", "I am religious, I wasn\u2019t there, and I am one \u201cwell meaning Christian\u201d away from an assault charge. \n\nOur doctrine doesn\u2019t support *any* of that. Losing a child is a tragedy and I\u2019m so sorry for your loss.", "I'm so sorry. I was new to the area so at least didn't have to deal with that.", "I'm straight up emotionally unbalanced so I would have got full Cocaine Hulk on anyone that said that to me", "When my brother died one dipshit said to his widow \u201cit\u2019s a shame you never got to give Niece siblings.\u201d\n\nMy niece was born after 18 miscarriages.\n\nShe was now fatherless. The lack of siblings for her was not the tragedy of his death.", "That's disgusting! And apparently no, they don't think.", "I swear some people don\u2019t think. I know of someone who was told at her father\u2019s funeral (after having already lost her mother) \u201cwhy are you crying, you\u2019re rich now\u201d (or words to that effect). To a grieving daughter in her mid 20\u2019s who lost both her parents in their 50\u2019s.\n\nTo make comments such as those are just insane and downright disgusting imo", "Yeah, I had my cousin once tell me that if I lost one of my kids it wouldn\u2019t be as bad as her potentially losing her daughter, because I would still have two left and she only has her daughter, so she would be alone. I absolutely flipped at her! WTF??? \n\nYTA - you mustn\u2019t have kids, otherwise you would not have said that. You\u2019re lucky her husband didn\u2019t kick you or punch you. I might have done it! What an idiot!", "Holy shit, that\u2019s the worst! \n\nOne of my good friends had a stillbirth and when she got pregnant again, one of her other (now former) friends said, \u201cwell, maybe now you can stop talking about *dead baby\u2019s name*.\u201d Like, having another baby would somehow replace the first one. And that same \u201cfriend\u201d also had the audacity to say after my friend got mad at her that \u201cit wasn\u2019t like you bonded with your first baby or anything\u201d. Absolutely rude.", "I don\u2019t know why it irks me so much when people say that, but it does. YES, I can, and DO, talk to my parents all the time. But, I want their comfort and advice, and they can no longer talk back and tell me those things. I just want to have a conversation with either one of them, and goddamn it, I want to hug them.", "If anyone had said that to me after my mother died, I seriously would have landed up in jail. I'm so sorry you had to deal with that.", "Yep. I \u201ctalk\u201d to my Mom but it\u2019s not the same as laying with my head in her lap talking about my day while she plays with my hair.", "Like you lost a pet or something\u2026.ack", "In so sorry. I've heard it a couple times too but always came back with, \"actually I can't. The infection I got left me with a scar where my uterus should be so it's physically impossible to carry.\" None of them have ever had a reply to that.", "It's because I wanted to be taking care of her. I had just held her minutes before, and then was told someone else was getting to hold her and care for her and love her when I wasn't given that chance. It hurt.", "If you don\u2019t believe in Heaven/an afterlife it\u2019s a complete shit lie and also, \u201cshe should be here so *I* can take care of her. WTF!?\u201d\n\nMy Dad tells me that about my Mom \u2014 \u201cshe\u2019s watching over you everyday \ud83e\udd70\u201d Listen, she didn\u2019t watch over me when she was alive. She sure as hell ain\u2019t doing it now that she\u2019s dead. But if it makes him feel better, whatever.", "Thank you", "Ohhh, you reminded me of the time my uncle died. My ex pestered me why I didn\u2019t answer the phone whole day and I told him I was attending uncle\u2019s funeral. My ex told me \u2018okay okay, go take a nap or something, I don\u2019t need your negativity\u2019. And my distraught ass was so completely lost in pain that my brain managed to twist the \u2018I don\u2019t need your negativity\u2019 part into \u2018I care about you and it saddens me to know you\u2019re sad, but Idk how to help so I\u2019m offering you to take a nap\u2019. Gh.", "It's way more minor, but when I was 9 and our family cat died, practically in my arms, I cried. A lot. For an hour until my dad said, \"That's enough crying for a cat. Get over it.\" He was always uncomfortable around people crying so he would even allow me to grieve the loss of a pet I loved.", "I don't think he does know that he's an AH, which is fucking disturbing.", "Just correcting a common misconception: the *average* lifespan was low because a lot of children died in infancy and childhood. If you made it through childhood you had pretty good odds of making it into your 60s and 70s.", "I don\u2019t think it is something you can ever say about a child dying.", "\"And to be honest maybe it's even for the better because if he lived he would be neurologically impaired and personally i would never prefer to be alive in his position.\"\n\nYou broke down what they said. My daughter would of been a quadriplegic if she had survived. I still would hate to hear those words come out of someone's mouth especially a friend.", "God needed another angel \ud83e\udd2e", "\u201cHeaven needed their angel back\u201d yuck. It\u2019s good that the husband kicked OP out because after saying that, OP was at an extremely high risk of getting punched in the face.", "Reading these comments makes me want to give all of these insensitive dipshits a kicking. In their softest, most sensitive bits. Repeatedly. When are people going to learn that all you need to say is \u201cI\u2019m sorry for your loss,\u201d and then stop talking. Trite clich\u00e9s are minimizing and unnecessary.", "Same. I am also religious but hearing about God\u2019s will and not leaning on my own understanding was not helpful to an 18 year old who lost her Grandma and Mother within months of each other right after finishing high school. Sometimes just being a silent presence is enough. Somehow my sister\u2019s 15 year old friends understood this better than every adult we knew.", "People absolutely suck.", "That person would give all of that money back and then some, just to have their parents back. What a horrible thing to say to someone who\u2019s grieving.", "It just seems to me we shouldn\u2019t have to discuss our personal reproductive futures when our babies are lying in a coffin a few feet away from us. The implication being \u201cJust replace this son with another one.\u201d See\u2026all fixed.", "No I get that, I'm atheist myself, I just wasn't sure if it was for a religious reason or no, which I'm legit now realizing was an invasive question to ask, so sorry to the person I commented on, that was insensitivity of me", "After my MC ppl would tell me stuff like that. And even if I believed it, I didn\u2019t give consent for her to go. I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. She would have been best off with you and it\u2019s not okay.", "What was the nap going to do? Help you forget that your uncle died? As for the part about negativity, yes death is not a barrel full of fun for the ones left behind. I\u2019m glad you got away from this insensitive individual", "When I was in high school, I had my first real boyfriend and I thought I was just so in love with him. I called him to cry on his shoulder because my aunt had just died and instead he broke up with me because I \u201cwas bumming him out\u201d.\n\nI was 15 but that experience left some deep scars.", "I\u2019m so sorry. The death of a pet, at any age, is so hard to deal with. It is sad that some people are numb to feelings but that doesn\u2019t mean that everyone around them should also be numb", "From one atheist to another, I\u2019m offering you a hug \ud83e\udec2 because at least in my life their a rarity \ud83e\udd72"]}
