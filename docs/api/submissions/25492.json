He did it with a straight face for a while until he realized that yeah telling me to eat less to lose weight and eat more and  gain fat wasn't really making a lot of sense.

That yes while preparing for a boxing match my body fat is really low, and I do have muscle making me slightly above the BMI normal number. Then he quickly dismissed me and called in the next guy.", "NTA\n\nWhat kind of a moron is your doctor? Are you sure he has a medical degree? Putting on muscle mass and putting on fat are not the same thing at all.\n\nAnd at your age, putting on a bunch of extra muscle is pretty normal. Partly you've been working out and deliberately trying to build muscle, and partly you're still going through puberty.", "YTA, because you are full of it, OP.  You aren\u2019t giving us the full story.  \n\nIf you were a lean shredded 170lbs, your doctor can obviously see that.  Your doctor most likely isn\u2019t a moron.  And no doctor actually uses BMI in the way you are suggesting.  It\u2019s one, fairly weak, metric that can be calculated with basic info everybody has without visiting a doctor.

It doesn\u2019t sound like you were bragging, but pointing out where the additional weight was coming from. The doc didn\u2019t listen to you or pay attention to specific and important details.

I've been to doctor's like that smh. You weren't bragging either; just explaining your weight gain.", "NTA, but I have to say it made me laugh! \"Look doc, I just got ripped. Take that to school!\"", "NTA. It is really outdated to look at weight/BMI alone and consider that an indicator of health. Someone could lose weight because they've been stuck in bed and their muscles atrophied- that doesn't make it a healthy weight loss. Sounds like your doctor should learn to listen.", "NTA. Switch doctors. No every doctor knows what they are talking about. Yes, if you had gained that much FAT in a year, it could be an issue. He's just looking at numbers and not accounting for anything else.", "Nta. Ah the downfall of the stupid BMI. Whoever created that should burn somewhere toasty bc it\u2019s not a real indication of health. I was told a healthy weight for my body was 100-120 or 105-120. I don\u2019t remember.

I dunno... being obese? This House M.D wannabe is acting like he's detected some hidden symptoms that no one else could spot.", "NTA\nSince you\u2019re bulking and working to get muscle, I don\u2019t see anything wrong with this. Muscles can be expensive when you need calories and in conjunction you gain fat. But when you cut calories to get lean, you lose fat in conjunction with some muscle. \n\nBMIs don\u2019t always tell folks the whole story.

I was just \"bulking\" and was only about \"15%\" bodyfat (nope).  \n\nI cut and bulked again and now I'm still obese but I get a constant stream of positive comments, fitness questions, and even nurses thinking I'm joking when I answered \"yes\" to the \"do you sometimes feel bad about your body\" screening questions.\n\nYes, BMI doesn't tell the whole story, but when your doctor and mom both tell you to lay off the sweets, there might be more going on.", "Maybe you should listen to what the person who went to medical school is telling you, instead of what you want to hear from the internet?", "So based on your previous comment, you started at 135 lb with 10% body fat, and are now at 170 lb with 15% body fat. \n\nThat means that you were carrying 13.5 lb of body fat a year ago and 25.5 lb of body fat currently. So while you gained 35 lb in total, 12.5 lb or 36% of your gains were fat. \n\nGaining 12.5 lb of fat in a year *is not healthy*. End of story. Given your age and assumed lack of other health conditions, it\u2019s not irreversible. But your doctor is factually correct, and you clearly still have a lot to learn about health, fitness, and nutrition.", "Nah, just newbie gains plus forcing food down after being malnourished basically my whole life lol", "Am woman in 40s. Can confirm. It doesn\u2019t get better. \n\nCalled in to ask because my cycle has gotten irregular. Probably perimenopausal but figured it\u2019s time to call in. Got a blank stare. No information given about peri or menopause, no guidance at all. I had to ask about things like timing for a Pap. So frustrating.", "I put on some fat gain, that\u2019s unavoidable when you\u2019re bulking. But even after the fat gain i a) have visible abs and b) am perfectly healthy according to my blood work, more so than I was before", "We don\u2019t use mom or mum in my country. I\u2019m translating from my language.", "There\u2019s regions of the UK where they say mom", "What's likely isn't relevant. Many, in fact most, Aita posts, are about situations that aren't very \"likely\". But that doesn't mean they didn't happen. \n\nOne of your options is making assumptions that we don't know are true, the other isn't. I'm gonna go with the option that makes the least assumptions. Number 1.\n\nAnd if that's so unbelievable to you, well then it sounds like you've been extremely lucky on what doctors you've seen throughout your life.", "Oh, you've run those numbers yourself, have you?", "Yeah, it's easy to believe he has a high intake of protein or whatever kind food to help him produce muscle, but I'm a bit doubtful of the working out part to actually produce the muscle. I just kinda picture a blob of a human sitting there with a goofy smile who's convinced  they're right about their routine. Again, I have seen overpaid doctors set in their own way, but I do have doubts about this post. Also, 170 does seem thin for someone that's 5' 10\".", "Maybe the doctor wasn't competent.", "It\u2019s entirely possible. I just think given I still have visible abs even after the fat I gained (I estimate I went from 10% to 15% body fat) it\u2019s ridiculous to say I\u2019m on the verge of obesity and should lay off the sweets.\n\nPlus, my mom doesn\u2019t think I\u2019m obese, she just thinks I should\u2019ve have \u2018bragged\u2019", "See I\u2019d be more alarmed if the bloodwork I did just last month didn\u2019t say I was healthy, healthier than I\u2019ve ever been. Cholesterol, blood pressure, etc everything was a healthy level, and previously it was unhealthy.", "I\u2019d be more likely to if he were to actually make his judgement with all the proper info", "No, you have to take into account the fact I was extremely malnourished and had an eating disorder before then. So gaining some fat and not starving myself anymore *is* what\u2019s healthy.\n\nPlus, a) 10% and 15% are just estimates and b) my blood work showed cholesterol levels, blood pressure, etc are all healthy, which indicates gaining some fat isn\u2019t as unhealthy as you say it is", "No, I still have visible abs after a year of bulk-cut cycles so I\u2019m not a blob", "Possible, but a lot more likely that OP is misrepresenting the whole truth", "Let's see some pics then", "Young feller, there is nothing you can tell a doctor in this scenario that they cant readily observe with their own eyes, hands, and instruments while examining you.  \n\nI\u2019m sorry you didn\u2019t like what you heard, but he\u2019s telling you that maybe don\u2019t have the best nutrition plan, and maybe are not taking the healthiest approach to building muscle.  \n\nDo you know how much garbage bro science is out there on this topic?  My guess if you found some of that.", "Sorry to hear that you\u2019re dealing with an ED. \n\nHowever, why is it so hard for you to accept that you aren\u2019t as knowledgeable as a medical professional with years of education and training?

Your doctor is seeing a disturbing trend of fat gain and pointing it out to you.", "HOW MUCH U BENCHIN THO BRO", "If your story actually isn't lacking any important information, then it's time for a new doctor. The doctor sounds like they're a bit outdated on their practices.", "Post a deidentified pic and we can all get to the bottom of why this doctor mistook you for obese\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSounds like he used the term obese and you just took it to heart like he was calling you a fat slob. Obesity is a medical definition based on BMI, not his personal opinion. Whether BMI is a good measurement or not (it isnt) is a totally different debate. Its entirely possible to be \"obese\" and somewhat fit after a bulk.", ".....have you been to a doctor recently?\nAs someone who's chronically ill-- good doctors are few and far between. Many doctors are incompetent-- mostly because they're overworked and don't have any experience of what is like to be sick.", "You're asking a minor to send you shirtless pics. Disgusting.", "> Young feller, there is nothing you can tell a doctor in this scenario that they cant readily observe with their own eyes, hands, and instruments while examining you\n\nEmpirically that\u2019s untrue given he\u2019s the one telling the guy with visible abs that he\u2019s on the verge of obesity \n\n> but he\u2019s telling you that maybe don\u2019t have the best nutrition plan, and maybe are not taking the healthiest approach to building muscle\n\nNope, I work with a licensed dietician to create and adjust my meal plan to my goals, and eat almost entirely clean food.", "His doctor is a quack lmfao. \n\n5\u201910 at 170 and 15% body fat is still small as hell for somebody training in the gym", "> However, why is it so hard for you to accept that you aren\u2019t as knowledgeable as a medical professional with years of education and training? \n\nIf you didn\u2019t ignore point B, that would answer your question. You\u2019re right that I personally know nothing about medicine. However, this very doctor a month ago said my blood work results show that I\u2019m healthy, more so than I was last year, without any medical ted flags. If there was, as you said, a \u2018disturbing trend\u2019, this wouldn\u2019t be the case.", "I can do 1 45 + 1 35 on each side pretty regularly.

That is not even overweight.", "What is with people asking a minor to post shirtless pics now? Creepy af.\n\nAs for using obese as a medical terminology, even by BMI I wouldn\u2019t count as obese, or even overweight.", "Duh, I was talking about uploading here so people can judge if the doctor is right in calling him fat or not.

Your test results can be in a normal range today because changes in diet often don\u2019t have an immediate impact on them. You also seem to think blood pressure is the result of a blood test, which\u2026 I don\u2019t even know where to start with that one. \n\nThe fact of the matter remains that your doctor noticed a disturbing change *in your year-over-year body composition* and pointed it out to you. Instead of taking the advice, you acted like a bratty know-it-all and put your ignorance on full display. \n\nBut if you\u2019re so confident that you\u2019re right about this, then cite some medical research proving that gaining 10+ pounds of fat in a year is totally fine and normal.", "I\u2019m not really inclined to believe a doctor when it comes to body composition. \n\nYeah they\u2019re educated and have a doctorate but a lot of them have horrible physiques and diets.", "First, what a ludicrous generalization. \n\nSecond, being able to give accurate medical advice has nothing to do with the physique of the doctor.
