At around your age I had a doctor in the military go through some test results and basic health stuff. He first went through the routine \"you have extra weight, put less butter on bread\" talk, then went in the next results and literally started a routine talk on my body fat being lower than recommended. He did it with a straight face for a while until he realized that yeah telling me to eat less to lose weight and eat more and  gain fat wasn't really making a lot of sense. He seemed a bit confused and just said something that I should find a better balance or something after finally talking to me about my results as a person instead of a number on a paper. That yes while preparing for a boxing match my body fat is really low, and I do have muscle making me slightly above the BMI normal number. Then he quickly dismissed me and called in the next guy.", "NTA\n\nWhat kind of a moron is your doctor? Are you sure he has a medical degree? Putting on muscle mass and putting on fat are not the same thing at all.\n\nAnd at your age, putting on a bunch of extra muscle is pretty normal. Partly you've been working out and deliberately trying to build muscle, and partly you're still going through puberty.", "YTA, because you are full of it, OP.  You aren\u2019t giving us the full story.  \n\nIf you were a lean shredded 170lbs, your doctor can obviously see that.  Your doctor most likely isn\u2019t a moron.  And no doctor actually uses BMI in the way you are suggesting.  It\u2019s one, fairly weak, metric that can be calculated with basic info everybody has without visiting a doctor.

It is fully appropriate to tell your dr you are going to the gym and eating extra protein.  Geeze, it even says consult your dr about your workout.

It doesn\u2019t sound like you were bragging, but pointing out where the additional weight was coming from. The doc didn\u2019t listen to you or pay attention to specific and important details.

I've been to doctor's like that smh. You weren't bragging either; just explaining your weight gain.", "NTA, but I have to say it made me laugh! \"Look doc, I just got ripped. Take that to school!\"", "NTA. It is really outdated to look at weight/BMI alone and consider that an indicator of health. Someone could lose weight because they've been stuck in bed and their muscles atrophied- that doesn't make it a healthy weight loss. Sounds like your doctor should learn to listen.", "NTA. Switch doctors. No every doctor knows what they are talking about. Yes, if you had gained that much FAT in a year, it could be an issue. He's just looking at numbers and not accounting for anything else.", "Nta. Ah the downfall of the stupid BMI. Whoever created that should burn somewhere toasty bc it\u2019s not a real indication of health. I was told a healthy weight for my body was 100-120 or 105-120. I don\u2019t remember.

I dunno... being obese? This House M.D wannabe is acting like he's detected some hidden symptoms that no one else could spot.", "NTA\nSince you\u2019re bulking and working to get muscle, I don\u2019t see anything wrong with this. Muscles can be expensive when you need calories and in conjunction you gain fat. But when you cut calories to get lean, you lose fat in conjunction with some muscle. \n\nBMIs don\u2019t always tell folks the whole story.
