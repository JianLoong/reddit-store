{"id": 13926, "submission_id": "12arrww", "title": "AITA for making a \"teacher\" feel like a POS?", "selftext": "I have a 7yo son who started exhibiting a lot of negative behaviors at school roughly a year ago. He's had tons of specialists evaluate him through the school system. He's fine when he is home and I truly don't have many issues with him here but at school it's totally different. Running away, refusing to stay inside classrooms, hiding, yelling, etc. We finally got him an IEP and things started looking up. The specialists came to the conclusion that he has severe anxiety and PTSD. \n\nNow.. this was a bitter pill to swallow as a parent. I left his father when he was only 3 years old due to some not so friendly behaviors that happened in front of my child. There's a no contact order, his rights have been terminated and he's been charged. It was only happening to me but my son saw it. I was stupid enough to believe that he wouldn't remember (I don't remember any of my childhood so it was an assumption based off personal experience). Well he obviously remembers and the specialists have stated that the amount of chaos within the school is very triggering for him and they have limited his contact with heavily socialized environments due to this. He stays in a special classroom. He was doing great until today, when they tried getting him to go to music class and something triggered him. I ended up being called to come in and help. \n\nWhen I got there, this teacher that I had never met was sitting with my son. As soon as he saw me he ran towards me crying and this teacher started yelling at him! Told him to sit down and start listening for once, proceeded to very loudly tell me he was being rotten all day and continued to tell him to sit down and listen whenever he tried hugging me. I lost my shit entirely. I had my son go in to the office to see one of his favorite peers and I let this bitch have it, telling her she must be the worst kind of  human to think that her behavior was in any way appropriate and that she had better stay far away from my son or I will make sure she doesn't have a job in the near future. When I left she was crying and now I feel terrible.\n\nETA: adding some info that others have mentioned: this \"teacher\" was the substitute for the IEP classroom. She went against his IEP care plan and tried forcing him to go to music class with 20+ other students versus go by his care plan, which clearly states he is to be put in groups of 2-3 other kiddos with IEPs for all his studies. The IEP has been in affect for over a month and this is the first time he's had an episode since being in the program and could have been avoided had she cared to take 2 seconds to read his individual care plan. I was also told by the principal (whom I called and reported this to) that this teacher had been briefed on my son's situation so she was fully aware how triggering even raising her voice to him was. She didn't care, obviously, or she wouldn't have been yelling at him to begin with. And yes, she actually did call him rotten. So not only was her voice raised through the entire altercation as my kid was crying but she was also not letting him hug me and calling him names.

That way if there continues to be issues, you can take it further up the chain.", "NTA. And if it were me? I'd be going to administration to get her removed from the schools sub list. Someone who acts like that has no business teaching kids. She can find something else to do with her life.", "NTA. Leaving aside any question about whether or not the teacher knew about the IEP and your son's requirements, you don't keep yelling at a visibly distressed child.", "NTA.

Honestly I recommend getting in touch with the school board and reporting this incident. This person doesn't need to be around any children, let alone those who need specified, individual care.", "[removed]", "You, in that moment, were doing the best you could. That's all anyone can do. Hell, if someone was yelling at a different kid and treating them that way (one without PTSD or anxiety) that'd be terribly wrong.", "[removed]", "Excuse me? That is a very bold and broad statement.\n\nFirst of all, this woman did this in front of the parent, so this is not an example of a teacher putting on a different face in front of parents. Also, this was a sub who does not regularly interact with the child and (if her district is anything like mine) likely has next to no actual teacher training.\n\nYes there are terrible teachers, as there are terrible people in every profession. But there are amazing teachers as well and I have known far more in the latter category.", "The teacher has a moral and professional obligation to follow an IEP. If she can't? She should find something else to do.\n\nAlso, nothing short of threatening violence would allow a response like she had to a child to be valid.", "So her not being educated to handle an IEP means she gets to scream at students?", "> You MUST accept that your child\u2019s father has psychiatric problems that your child may very well have inherited.\n\nLike what? Please explain what \"psychiatric problems\" the father has.", "> I think the child needs therapy\n\nhe's in therapy.\n\n>  think you need to look into moving him into a class with a teacher that specialises in special education\n\nHe WAS in that class. There WAS a teacher that knew his circumstances and worked with the care plan. THIS teacher was a SUBSTITUTE who disregarded the clearly worded care plan.\n\n> I am no expert, but it seems like him witnessing your abuse has triggered a sort of protection instinct in him, in which he doesn't want to leave your side, in case you get hurt.\n\nYou're right. You are no \"expert\". It's stated that he has PTSD and anxiety. How those present and why are different for every person. You don't know that he has some instinct to \"protect\" his mother. In this instance most people would say he was running to her for comfort because a stranger was shouting at him.\n\n> The son you see and interact with is probably very different to the one that the teachers get\n\nYes. That's why he has a detailed care plan that teachers have followed, stopping the disruptive behavior for an entire month until this substitute teacher fucked it up.\n\n> And so I think some steps need to be taken moving forward to avoid this from happening again.\n\nThe mother spoke to the principal, the head of the school.\n\n> He is going to have to meet new people, who aren't going to be briefed on everything going on with him, and so I think some professional help and some extra help at home would go a long way.\n\nTHIS IS AT A SCHOOL. THE SCHOOL IS REQUIRED TO SHOW HIS CARE PLAN TO THE TEACHERS HE IS CARED FOR BY. THE PROBLEM IS ALREADY TAKEN CARE OF BEFORE THIS TEACHER WAS A COMPLETE MORON.\n\n LITERALLY EVERYTHING YOU BROUGHT UP IS ADDRESSED IN THE FUCKING POST", "She might have been forced into that room. I used to sub and I can't tell you how many times I signed up for a specific grade/subject and got forced into a SPED room when I got to the school. It's really frustrating. Clearly not a good situation for anyone, the teachers or the kids.", "> my school refused to give me anyone\u2019s IEPs because they didn\u2019t want to \u2018prejudice me against the children.\u2019 \n\nYikes!

As someone who was verbally abused that way by teachers like that, it can be a lifelong thing that negatively impacts how you live. You never forget, no matter how much you try. That person should not be a teacher.", "NTA", "I love this. Glad she was crying.  NTA.", "She was not professional at all and based on the words of OP herself, she never tried to be professional the first minutes she was his teacher/caretaker.

Sounds like a terrible ordeal for both of you.", "Jesus H Christ. NTA.

I am also incredibly sorry that you and your son are bearing the brunt of the consequences. \n\nSecondly, you had every right to go absolutely nuts at this teacher. PTSD is not to be messed with. She was his guardian for the day, she was briefed, and she was rotten. If she didn\u2019t want to be yelled at, then she should have listened. \n\nIronic, isn\u2019t it? \n\nYou were being protective. Of course you got angry. Of course you saw red. Of course you yelled. And frankly, of course you feel bad now - good people tend to look back on situations like that and find sympathy, and think they could have handled things better. You are clearly a good person. My question is: do you think she went home and reconsidered how she treated your son? I doubt it.", "People like you are why we have laws so disabled children don't get fucked over in schools.", "Yes. He should listen to trusted adults over ones telling him to do something that would harm him.", "Jesus Christ fuck your victim blaming.", "...did your teachers yell at you when you were 7 years old?\n\nI'm sorry that happened to you. That must have been very upsetting for it to still be affecting you like this.", "Why would you convince yourself he doesn't?", "I guess I just got really lucky with my elem principal. One of the nicest people I've ever had the pleasure of knowing, its hard to believe that people who work in a school with such vulnerable kids wouldn't have their best interest at heart. \n\nBut tbh whether or not she was told - i have a feeling it wouldn't matter because who the fuck thinks its ok to scream at a child?", "No, but I did once have a child soil herself in my class. I was told that none of the children were allowed to have bathroom breaks during class, but this one girl had an IEP saying she needed to go to the bathroom when she asked. Did anyone tell me about that IEP? Nope. Was her main teacher concerned that this poor girl humiliated herself because of our draconian bathroom policy and their unwillingness to communicate kids\u2019 basic medical needs? Nope. Were her parents furious? Yes.\n\nDid my administrators yell at me in front of the kids when I started letting them go to the bathroom during class? Also yes.", "No one thinks it\u2019s okay to scream at children, but everyone has a breaking point where they\u2019ll lose their temper. Teachers losing their tempers is guaranteed to happen more and more as teachers quit, classroom sizes swell, wages stagnate, and education budgets are cut and curriculums interfered with. When I taught, I saw it happen in real time where the overwhelming pressure turned the nicest people I\u2019ve ever met into banshees. My first impression of the most highly awarded teacher in my district was peeking into her class and seeing her scream at her whole classroom that they were acting like babies for crying when she yelled at them and she\u2019d send them back to kindergarten with the babies. \n\nAt a certain point, you can\u2019t keep clicking your tongue at individual teachers.

Even as a regular teacher, it can take weeks for me to get my hands on IEPs. I\u2019ll have the \u2018joy\u2019 of discovering the autism kids, the ADHD kids, the ED kids, etc all on my own. It think it\u2019s highly unlikely this substitute had any information about the son in this scenario. I imagine she\u2019d have had a much different approach had she known.", "I didn\u2019t respond because I didn\u2019t see the comment. I\u2019m not on this app 24/7. And I still don\u2019t believe the OP gave us the entire story. I don\u2019t believe the teacher did go against the IEP. My take is the the OP is giving partial truths", "NTA!!!  \n\n\nThat woman needs to be far far away from teaching kids in future!", "NTA\nPlease report this individual immediately. There should NOT be a next time and they should NEVER be put in front of children again", "Omfg! Somewhat related. My son had a return to school plan and the principal didn't tell his teachers (she assured me she would), one stipulation being if he asks to leave, he needs to leave. He can't articulate what a panic attack feels like, he just knows something is wrong, and when that happens, he asks to go to the office. 3 different teachers told him no. He had a panic attack in front of his peers which was humiliating and terrifying for him.\n\n\nWhen I asked her wtf happened, she said 'I hadn't told any of his teachers yet so they wouldn't be prejudiced against him'.... so she's essentially saying she doesn't trust her educators to not JUDGE a child with special/different needs. Absolutely disgusting excuse in my opinion.", "That makes it sound like it's okay to start yelling when you don't get your way. The idea is to teach kids *not* to do that, and give them tools besides anger and intimidation.\n\nIt's never too late though. Good luck.", "I doubt the substitute decided that, the school likely didn\u2019t properly inform them and took whoever was available."]}
