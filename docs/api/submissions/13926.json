{"id": 13926, "submission_id": "12arrww", "title": "AITA for making a \"teacher\" feel like a POS?", "selftext": "I have a 7yo son who started exhibiting a lot of negative behaviors at school roughly a year ago. He's had tons of specialists evaluate him through the school system. He's fine when he is home and I truly don't have many issues with him here but at school it's totally different. Running away, refusing to stay inside classrooms, hiding, yelling, etc. We finally got him an IEP and things started looking up. The specialists came to the conclusion that he has severe anxiety and PTSD. \n\nNow.. this was a bitter pill to swallow as a parent. I left his father when he was only 3 years old due to some not so friendly behaviors that happened in front of my child. There's a no contact order, his rights have been terminated and he's been charged. It was only happening to me but my son saw it. I was stupid enough to believe that he wouldn't remember (I don't remember any of my childhood so it was an assumption based off personal experience). Well he obviously remembers and the specialists have stated that the amount of chaos within the school is very triggering for him and they have limited his contact with heavily socialized environments due to this. He stays in a special classroom. He was doing great until today, when they tried getting him to go to music class and something triggered him. I ended up being called to come in and help. \n\nWhen I got there, this teacher that I had never met was sitting with my son. As soon as he saw me he ran towards me crying and this teacher started yelling at him! Told him to sit down and start listening for once, proceeded to very loudly tell me he was being rotten all day and continued to tell him to sit down and listen whenever he tried hugging me. I lost my shit entirely. I had my son go in to the office to see one of his favorite peers and I let this bitch have it, telling her she must be the worst kind of  human to think that her behavior was in any way appropriate and that she had better stay far away from my son or I will make sure she doesn't have a job in the near future. When I left she was crying and now I feel terrible.\n\nETA: adding some info that others have mentioned: this \"teacher\" was the substitute for the IEP classroom. She went against his IEP care plan and tried forcing him to go to music class with 20+ other students versus go by his care plan, which clearly states he is to be put in groups of 2-3 other kiddos with IEPs for all his studies. The IEP has been in affect for over a month and this is the first time he's had an episode since being in the program and could have been avoided had she cared to take 2 seconds to read his individual care plan. I was also told by the principal (whom I called and reported this to) that this teacher had been briefed on my son's situation so she was fully aware how triggering even raising her voice to him was. She didn't care, obviously, or she wouldn't have been yelling at him to begin with. And yes, she actually did call him rotten. So not only was her voice raised through the entire altercation as my kid was crying but she was also not letting him hug me and calling him names. He's in therapy.", "created_utc": 1680543773, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12arrww/aita_for_making_a_teacher_feel_like_a_pos/", "score": 561, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your child needs you to heal as well.", "This is a hard one. I think the child needs therapy ASAP, and I think you need to look into moving him into a class with a teacher that specialises in special education, so that he can get the help and support he needs, even as a temporary measure to help him adjust to not being around you. I am no expert, but it seems like him witnessing your abuse has triggered a sort of protection instinct in him, in which he doesn't want to leave your side, in case you get hurt. But that obviously conflicts with what he NEEDS, which is an education, and the ability to develop meaningful relationships with friends. \n\nI don't think the teacher yelling at him does anyone, any favours. Nor do I think you yelling at her does anything. You have to realise that you are getting the best of your son. The son you see and interact with is probably very different to the one that the teachers get. And so I think some steps need to be taken moving forward to avoid this from happening again. He is going to have substitute teachers from time to time. He is going to have to meet new people, who aren't going to be briefed on everything going on with him, and so I think some professional help and some extra help at home would go a long way. \n\nSo Kinda TA I guess?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Teacher disrespected the hell out of this kid, and who knows how many other kids they've disrespected if they're that comfy calling a kid rotten right in front of a parent.\n\nThat teacher deserves to be fired and banned in my mind. Making the teacher feel like shit is a very very small portion of what they deserve.", "Why should you ever yell at a kid ? Everyone knows if you ask them nicely they always do it", "Found the sub!", "OP said that the teacher was spoken to prior to this about it and knew of his needs, specifically the yelling even", "Does he ever have to do work or regular class work ?", "I know what an IEP is. I think youre the asshole because I don\u2019t believe you\u2019re giving the full story.", "Apparently not if you think OP is an asshole \ud83d\ude02 Substitute Teacher decided she was gonna do what she wanted, f*cked around and found out.", "Again, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re getting the complete story. That\u2019s why I voted YTA", "NTA- that sub should never sub again \n\n\nBtw now y\u2019all see how teachers act towards students, they put in a different face around the parents.", "NTA and best wishes for you and your son.", "NTA. Please don\u2019t be hard on yourself. Unfortunately trauma is one of those things that leave a long lasting impression, even if you don\u2019t actually remember. You are doing right by your kiddo, and I would suggest if possible having it put in the IEP that this teacher is not allowed to work with your son. That way if there continues to be issues, you can take it further up the chain.", "NTA. And if it were me? I'd be going to administration to get her removed from the schools sub list. Someone who acts like that has no business teaching kids. She can find something else to do with her life.", "NTA. Leaving aside any question about whether or not the teacher knew about the IEP and your son's requirements, you don't keep yelling at a visibly distressed child.", "NTA. I'm not sure how you *could* be the asshole here. *Sends Hugs!*", "NTA I\u2019m sorry you and your little guy are going through this, it sounds really hard.", "NTA and that is so far from professional that I am fucking astounded. Honestly I recommend getting in touch with the school board and reporting this incident. This person doesn't need to be around any children, let alone those who need specified, individual care.", "[removed]", "You, in that moment, were doing the best you could. That's all anyone can do. Hell, if someone was yelling at a different kid and treating them that way (one without PTSD or anxiety) that'd be terribly wrong.", "[removed]", "Excuse me? That is a very bold and broad statement.\n\nFirst of all, this woman did this in front of the parent, so this is not an example of a teacher putting on a different face in front of parents. Also, this was a sub who does not regularly interact with the child and (if her district is anything like mine) likely has next to no actual teacher training.\n\nYes there are terrible teachers, as there are terrible people in every profession. But there are amazing teachers as well and I have known far more in the latter category.", "The teacher has a moral and professional obligation to follow an IEP. If she can't? She should find something else to do.\n\nAlso, nothing short of threatening violence would allow a response like she had to a child to be valid.", "So her not being educated to handle an IEP means she gets to scream at students?", "> You MUST accept that your child\u2019s father has psychiatric problems that your child may very well have inherited.\n\nLike what? Please explain what \"psychiatric problems\" the father has.", "> I think the child needs therapy\n\nhe's in therapy.\n\n>  think you need to look into moving him into a class with a teacher that specialises in special education\n\nHe WAS in that class. There WAS a teacher that knew his circumstances and worked with the care plan. THIS teacher was a SUBSTITUTE who disregarded the clearly worded care plan.\n\n> I am no expert, but it seems like him witnessing your abuse has triggered a sort of protection instinct in him, in which he doesn't want to leave your side, in case you get hurt.\n\nYou're right. You are no \"expert\". It's stated that he has PTSD and anxiety. How those present and why are different for every person. You don't know that he has some instinct to \"protect\" his mother. In this instance most people would say he was running to her for comfort because a stranger was shouting at him.\n\n> The son you see and interact with is probably very different to the one that the teachers get\n\nYes. That's why he has a detailed care plan that teachers have followed, stopping the disruptive behavior for an entire month until this substitute teacher fucked it up.\n\n> And so I think some steps need to be taken moving forward to avoid this from happening again.\n\nThe mother spoke to the principal, the head of the school.\n\n> He is going to have to meet new people, who aren't going to be briefed on everything going on with him, and so I think some professional help and some extra help at home would go a long way.\n\nTHIS IS AT A SCHOOL. THE SCHOOL IS REQUIRED TO SHOW HIS CARE PLAN TO THE TEACHERS HE IS CARED FOR BY. THE PROBLEM IS ALREADY TAKEN CARE OF BEFORE THIS TEACHER WAS A COMPLETE MORON.\n\n LITERALLY EVERYTHING YOU BROUGHT UP IS ADDRESSED IN THE FUCKING POST", "She might have been forced into that room. I used to sub and I can't tell you how many times I signed up for a specific grade/subject and got forced into a SPED room when I got to the school. It's really frustrating. Clearly not a good situation for anyone, the teachers or the kids.", "> my school refused to give me anyone\u2019s IEPs because they didn\u2019t want to \u2018prejudice me against the children.\u2019 \n\nYikes! Sounds like they assumed most subs would not take the job if they knew what they would be dealing with. Totally unfair to the subs and the kids.", "Partial comment stolen from u/NovelRemarkable7136\n\nu/intenwegh is a bot", "Partial comment stolen from u/misslo718\n\nu/necesfgs is a bot", "There is about a 99% chance that if they hadn't let the sub know about the plan that the principal would lie about it\n\nSource: I am a human and I have interacted with other humans my entire life", "I\u2019m sure my principle would have said the same thing if a parent complained about me not following an IEP. An IEP I never got.", "The worst part was that I wasn\u2019t even a sub. \ud83d\ude2c I was a full time, 6:30 - 5:00 teacher.", "Yeah maybe the sub wasn't told and principal is covering his ass, seen posts like that before - is teacher an AH for not giving accommodations they weren't officially informed of?", " You did not yell at her in front of other children and after witnessing her in action you sent your child to another room.", "Oh my God.", "What \"complete story\" justifies the teacher's actions to go against a legally binding school care plan, exactly?"]}
