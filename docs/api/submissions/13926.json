{"id": 13926, "submission_id": "12arrww", "title": "AITA for making a \"teacher\" feel like a POS?", "selftext": "I have a 7yo son who started exhibiting a lot of negative behaviors at school roughly a year ago. He's had tons of specialists evaluate him through the school system. He's fine when he is home and I truly don't have many issues with him here but at school it's totally different. Running away, refusing to stay inside classrooms, hiding, yelling, etc. We finally got him an IEP and things started looking up. The specialists came to the conclusion that he has severe anxiety and PTSD. \n\nNow.. this was a bitter pill to swallow as a parent. I left his father when he was only 3 years old due to some not so friendly behaviors that happened in front of my child. There's a no contact order, his rights have been terminated and he's been charged. It was only happening to me but my son saw it. I was stupid enough to believe that he wouldn't remember (I don't remember any of my childhood so it was an assumption based off personal experience). Well he obviously remembers and the specialists have stated that the amount of chaos within the school is very triggering for him and they have limited his contact with heavily socialized environments due to this. He stays in a special classroom. He was doing great until today, when they tried getting him to go to music class and something triggered him. I ended up being called to come in and help. \n\nWhen I got there, this teacher that I had never met was sitting with my son. As soon as he saw me he ran towards me crying and this teacher started yelling at him! Told him to sit down and start listening for once, proceeded to very loudly tell me he was being rotten all day and continued to tell him to sit down and listen whenever he tried hugging me. I lost my shit entirely. I had my son go in to the office to see one of his favorite peers and I let this bitch have it, telling her she must be the worst kind of  human to think that her behavior was in any way appropriate and that she had better stay far away from my son or I will make sure she doesn't have a job in the near future. When I left she was crying and now I feel terrible.\n\nETA: adding some info that others have mentioned: this \"teacher\" was the substitute for the IEP classroom. She went against his IEP care plan and tried forcing him to go to music class with 20+ other students versus go by his care plan, which clearly states he is to be put in groups of 2-3 other kiddos with IEPs for all his studies. The IEP has been in affect for over a month and this is the first time he's had an episode since being in the program and could have been avoided had she cared to take 2 seconds to read his individual care plan. I was also told by the principal (whom I called and reported this to) that this teacher had been briefed on my son's situation so she was fully aware how triggering even raising her voice to him was. She didn't care, obviously, or she wouldn't have been yelling at him to begin with. And yes, she actually did call him rotten. So not only was her voice raised through the entire altercation as my kid was crying but she was also not letting him hug me and calling him names. He's in therapy.", "created_utc": 1680543773, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12arrww/aita_for_making_a_teacher_feel_like_a_pos/", "score": 107, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I was an elementary ed teacher and a special ed teacher. And I'm sorry she had no self-control and took out her frustrations on your son- if she thinks what she said was ok, then I hate to think what she's saying to your son privately.", "NTA\n\nYelling should be reserved for immediate danger (running into traffic). Absolutely no reason a teacher should be yelling at an already distraught child, especially one with an IEP. \n\nWas there a more diplomatic approach on your end? Yeah probably. But forreal I'd be doing the same thing. Zero patience for adults being cruel to children. Especially when the child's in their care.", "nta as someone who is a teacher for young kids, raising your voice at a small child is NEVER the answer. she needs to take some more classes on classroom management and how to treat kids like they\u2019re people rather than monsters she has to look after. good on you mama.", "NTA. Who tf yells at a crying child going to his parent for comfort??? Like what???? Even if he had been misbehaved, good lord he's only 7, let the kid go to his mom for a hug, no one's getting any sort on conversation done when the kid's in hysterics. I mean, maybe yelling at them was out of line but honestly I can't blame you.", "NTA you need to write the entire interaction down while it is still fresh in your memory and take it further. It is never a one time thing. Nobody waves a red flag then puts it away and never waves it again.", "NTA \nThat teacher broke the law by ignoring your son's care plan and not following the IEP, and that should be brought up.\nI truly don't understand why teachers who work with special needs are so awful and tend to act like it's the child's fault. It is appalling.", "Honestly it\u2019s never appropriate to yell at a young child in that manner. Especially when they are distressed and even more so when they have specific protocols in place because they are known to get stressed easily. \n\nThe teacher was completely inappropriate. I don\u2019t condone yelling at an adult enough to cause them to cry but they paid no attention on how to do their job and potentially caused a setback with your kid\u2019s progress. \n\nTo the comment saying teachers are underpaid and overworked, that does not excuse them intimidating children. Not all teachers are good teachers.", "The substitute had been briefed and still din't follow the IEP.\n\nThe teacher is in the wrong.\n\nNTA", "NTA because you\u2019re a mama bear protecting your child, but you definitely could have handled it better.\n\nI\u2019m a teacher and a parent of a 7 year-old. The teacher/staff member was behaving inappropriately. She was probably struggling and wasn\u2019t given the tools to handle what she was experiencing with your son. It seems as though perhaps she has not read your son\u2019s IEP - is she someone who works with him regularly? If she will continue to support him, then unfortunately you\u2019ll want to bite the bullet and be the bigger person for the sake of your son. Go back and apologize for your behaviour. Explain that you were riled up in the moment because you are understandably protective of your son and it was clear from her language in front of him that she misunderstands his situation.\n\nAlso talk to admin about making sure all staff who will be disciplining your child has thoroughly read and understood his IEP. Make sure you understand what\u2019s in the document and what your rights are where his IEP is concerned. It is a legal document and if the school knows you are on top of it and paying close attention to how they are implementing it, all the better.", "INFO: are you and your child doing any sort of family therapy? Is your sons school aware of the diagnosis? What\u2019s your next move now that you have an IEP?", "NTA\n\nTeachers, although very often mistreated and abused at work, can be abusive aholes too.\n\nMany professions that require trust and working with vulnerable people attract powerhungry psychos for the easy pickings.\n\nThanks for standing up to bullies. Some people shouldnt be teachers. especially those who wont take a few minutes to read a simple document.", "NTA \n1. The sub was briefed on your child's iep\n2. She knew she was in a class full of IEP students \n3. Calling children names and screaming at them is counterproductive.\n4. You did not yell at her in front of other children and after witnessing her in action you sent your child to another room and then let her have a piece of your mind and only after you saw the verbal abuse.\n5. I'm impressed because you managed to get your son out of ear shot beforehand.", "Nta- but it could have been handled a little better. Especially there were other children in the room. But as a parent i do understand the need to protect your child above all else. Your son needs therapy to help work on his issues. Things need to escalate but the correct way when it comes to the teacher. Bring your concern to the principal and the the superintendent. Teachers need the reminder that some kids are different and have to be handled with kid gloves in some cases.", "INFO: Knowing your son has severe anxiety and PTSD why isnt he in a class for kids with special needs?", "YTA - you just reinforced the notion that your son has to listen to you and not his teacher.", "[deleted]", "NTA but I wouldn't be too hard on the sub. Despite what the principal told you I wouldn't be a bit surprised if the sub wasn't properly trained or educated to handle an IEP. Schools have to take what they can get when it comes to subs and often you don't get one properly trained.", "YTA\n\nYour son is a challenge for the underpaid and overworked teachers you're leaving him in the care of. \n\nYou aren't dealing with him when he behaves the way he does, so perhaps you should be more forgiving and understanding. \n\nYou've escalated the situation above and beyond what was needed. \n\nI hope you're seeking therapy. Your child needs you to heal as well.", "This is a hard one. I think the child needs therapy ASAP, and I think you need to look into moving him into a class with a teacher that specialises in special education, so that he can get the help and support he needs, even as a temporary measure to help him adjust to not being around you. I am no expert, but it seems like him witnessing your abuse has triggered a sort of protection instinct in him, in which he doesn't want to leave your side, in case you get hurt. But that obviously conflicts with what he NEEDS, which is an education, and the ability to develop meaningful relationships with friends. \n\nI don't think the teacher yelling at him does anyone, any favours. Nor do I think you yelling at her does anything. You have to realise that you are getting the best of your son. The son you see and interact with is probably very different to the one that the teachers get. And so I think some steps need to be taken moving forward to avoid this from happening again. He is going to have substitute teachers from time to time. He is going to have to meet new people, who aren't going to be briefed on everything going on with him, and so I think some professional help and some extra help at home would go a long way. \n\nSo Kinda TA I guess?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
