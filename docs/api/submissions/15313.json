Last year she started complaining that she travels too much and that she wasn't spending enough time with her husband (\"Mitch\" my friend) and their two kids (son 8) (daughter 9).  Last year Jane was working with our Chicago office and made a huge, I mean huge, mistake on a project.  So much so that the head of our Chicago office wanted her head on pike.  I had to cut my vacation short and fly out to Chicago, calm Helen (Head of the Chicago office) down and help fix Jane's mistake.  Jane was all but fired, but I went to bat for her and called in a few chips, and she wasn't fired.  She wasn't fired in fact, she was made assistant department head for another department.  Granted, that department is known as the \"Dead Zone,\" but she did get a bump in pay and does not have to travel anymore, and is out the door at 5 pm. \n\nAbout a month ago I was having drinks with the head of our international department and he asked if there were two people I would recommend for international because they are expanding.  He wanted two people already with the company before posting outside the company.  I said yep, \"Caleb\" great worker, speaks five languages, just finished up his Master's in international business, and Heather great worker, quick learner, master of team and morale building, and she defines organized.\"  Well both of them interviewed and they both got the jobs.  \n\nI thought everything was fine until today when I got a call from Mitch telling me that Jane was upset with me and was at home in tears.  I told him I don't why she is upset with me I have been in NYC for the past three weeks, just got back home yesterday, and asked if I could come over to see what was going on.  He said sure, I got there, he's standing in the driveway.  I get out, and he tells me she's mad that I didn't recommend her for one of the spots in international.  I look at him dumbfounded, and he says, \"Yeah, Man, I know it's crazy, but she felt you could at least recommend her.  \" She comes out and goes on a tangent, saying that I should have put her up for one of the openings, that it would have raised her profile and at least shown that she had ambition outside of the dead zone.  Then she says, \"You are not a good friend or a good person.\" Mitch goes to say something, but I stop him.  I tell her very calmly, \"If it wasn't for this, not good friend and person Helen would have had your head on a pike and had all the interns in the Chicago office come by and throw rocks at.  If it was not for this not good friend and not-good person who spent a boatload of my own personal money on bottles of expensive bourbon and scotch and who called in chips on your behalf, you would be out of a job.  There is no way in any known universe you were or are going to get a job in international.\" I got in my car and left.

Does she understand the mistake she made or was it fixed for or around her? Does she genuinely believe she deserves this promotion? Would your statements have been a shock to her? Answers to these questions could change my judgement.", "NTA. \n\nWas she aware of how much you bailed her out? If she knew and still made a stink about the recommendation, that\u2019s awkward.

After bailing out such a huge mistake I\u2019d be asking that person to have my back in the future and trust that I clearly had theirs.", "NTA\n\nYou recommended two people, a man and a woman, who are exceptional rising stars with a lot of ambition, but who clearly have a positive contribution to the company and work culture. Meanwhile, Jane demonstrated both a lack of ambition in her desire to scale back her work, and a propensity for error with her massive fuck up. She's lucky to have a job at all, but she's outright confused if she thinks she really has a future with upward mobility at a company where she got herself blackballed and only due in thanks to the guy she vilified for not playing her up to the heads.\n\nThe reason you didn't recommend her is because the people who you did recommend still had to be interviewed and verified. You didn't wave a wand and boom promotion, they still had to vouch for themselves, and Jane absolutely would not have survived that. Plus, it'd harm your reputation to do so as it would appear as if you lacked good judgement.

I\u2019ve also seen this sort of thing play out where the person really didn\u2019t understand how big their mistake was because they only got lightly scolded because their protector found out about the problem and dealt with the higher ups before the higher ups talked to the one who screwed up.  It was nepotism in that case - the nephew didn\u2019t understand that his biiiig paperwork screwup could\u2019ve caused a severe enough financial bind to threaten the company (partly because it broke laws and there would\u2019ve been big fines if it hadn\u2019t been caught) because his uncle was a VP and the nephew\u2019s supervisor felt like she couldn\u2019t really lay into the nephew without causing herself problems because uncle VP had stepped in (even though she wasn\u2019t under uncle VP\u2019s chain of command)."]}
