If you think they will feel betrayed feeling you took advantage of their kindness when they hear you bought a house, maybe less yay.\n\nYou could always disclose a very limited amount such as just that you are doing ok on your own and while you greatly appreciate their kindness as it helps you achieve your goals faster, you didn\u2019t want to accept help under false pretenses.

You probably still are less wealthy than them, but right now, you are basically freeloading off of their generosity and, to be honest, pity for your assumed unfortunate financial situation. \n\nYou are an adult. So behave as adult do and pull your own weight. There is virtually no reason to hide that information from them. They'll probably congratulate you on your financial and career progress, and if they still decide to support you, you can now take it without second thoughts. However, it'd be time to actually give back - or at least, stop relying on wealthy friends when you are more than capable to take care of yourself.", "You absolutely are.

You're assuming that they're assuming. That's a lot of assuming. If they cared, they would ask.\n* For them, it might be worth it to have a tenant in the property who will take care of it, they aren't paying for property management, and it's someone who they know and trust. If they're not looking to make a profit on rent, having the property well maintained may be worth more to them than a higher rent, but riskier tenant.\n* They offered - you didn't ask. \n\nNow, IF they do ask, and you hide it, THEN YWBTA, but until then, keep saving for your own place and work on getting ahead. They are probably aware you don't have generational wealth or help, and buying a home is an expensive and difficult thing anymore for most single income earners. Don't take advantage of the situation, but use it to get in the position to get your own place like they are helping you do - in other words, don't go blowing your money on other things (newer cars, too many expensive nights out, etc), live on a budget and get that savings beefed up ASAP.", "NTA.  They offered, you accepted.  Their lives may be enhanced by their generosity.  (they feel better about themselves by giving).  don't ask don't tell", "Absolutely NTA. I fail to see why you think they are doing this because of what they think about your finances. You are a friend of their daughter for 20 years. They can trust you to be a good tenant. They can trust you to pay your rent. They can trust you to not trash the place. All of this costs them a lot more if they were to help someone else. Letting you live there is helping them just as much it is helping you.\n\nAlso, if you're living in North America in HCOL cities, 6 figures is not enough. People who make comfortably to afford their own home in HCOL areas do not say they make 6 figures anymore. You really cannot afford million dollar house if you're on the low end of 6 figures.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
