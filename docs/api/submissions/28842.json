But to maintain your non-asshole status, you should be out the SECOND you can afford to. And maybe ask if they can offer the same deal to someone in your office who isn't making a ton of money.", "NAH.\n\nIn all likelihood what you make is probably still so little compared to what they have that they would likely consider you still in need of help.\n\nPeople who are fortunate enough to be that generous are not missing anything or struggling to help you. You also are doing exactly what they expected with their offer - you aren\u2019t abusing their generosity by saving for a house when you told them you would be saving for a house.\n\nPeople who can afford to do this do these types of things for family.\n\nDon\u2019t lie if asked directly but remember that you haven\u2019t been asked directly for a reason. They *want* to do this, and as long as you appreciate it and feel comfortable with the arrangement I think everything will be okay.", "NAH, but honestly you\u2019re taking advantage of their generosity and you know it. \n\nI\u2019d tell them you got a raise and want to know if they want to revisit the arrangement. I would not  tell them specifics but I\u2019d be more in the ballpark and just see how they react. For all you know you\u2019re eating away at their retirement funds.", "NAH\n\nI understand not wanting to discuss your finances with others.\n\nPerhaps you would want to consider if you should discuss some level of your situation with them based on how they will react in the future? \n\nIf they are simply being supportive friends because they can, yay. If you think they will feel betrayed feeling you took advantage of their kindness when they hear you bought a house, maybe less yay.\n\nYou could always disclose a very limited amount such as just that you are doing ok on your own and while you greatly appreciate their kindness as it helps you achieve your goals faster, you didn\u2019t want to accept help under false pretenses. Maybe they will want to continue. Maybe they would rather help someone who is in desperate need. Either way it protects your future friendship.", "NAH.\n\nFWIW, making low 6 figures in a HCOL area isn't exactly rolling in money.  35 years ago 6 figures in NYC was kinda meaningful.  Today?  It's not.", "NAH\n\nYou have been in their lives for 20 years, that is a long time. They probably want to help you out because of who you are, not because of how much you make.\n\nThey are helping you to be able to afford a house, and as long as you are saving money towards that goal then everything is above board. If you were not saving money towards that goal the story may be different.\n\nYou have an idea that they may have helped you out of pity, but you don\u2019t know that to be the truth. \n\nIf it would help clear your conscience to disclose your income to them then you should do it, but you haven\u2019t don\u2019t anything wrong and shouldn\u2019t feel the need to do so out of guilt.", "NAH, if someone is doing this for you because they care then let them and be grateful. If you are ever to do a kind gesture for someone you care about, do it. \n\nI dont think financial disclosures would be appropriate.", "NAH. If your money situation was an important factor in their decision, then its on them to inquire about how things are going with you - IF it was important to their decision. They may genuinely not care. \n\nAlso gonna point out - you making 6 figures Now is still quite different than your friend who was born into wealth, and they may still see helping you out as a worthy cause, since you don't have that generational wealth they do.", "They pitied you and you took an offer.  You didn't know it was out of pity!  No, don't worry about it.", "YWBTA if you didn't bring this up.  A good way that wouldn't feel embarrassing for you is to say you got a really good raise and ask if they want to amend your payments.", "Pay it forward dude\n\nThese people sound amazing. Take this as an inspiration, not as profit\n\nEdit: YTA", "YTA, a bit. You probably still are less wealthy than them, but right now, you are basically freeloading off of their generosity and, to be honest, pity for your assumed unfortunate financial situation. \n\nYou are an adult. So behave as adult do and pull your own weight. There is virtually no reason to hide that information from them. They'll probably congratulate you on your financial and career progress, and if they still decide to support you, you can now take it without second thoughts. However, it'd be time to actually give back - or at least, stop relying on wealthy friends when you are more than capable to take care of yourself.", "You absolutely are. They think they are helping you when you are just being greedy.", "YTA. You're lying by omission and taking advantage of them", "I'll go with NTA for a few reasons:\n\n* They didn't ask. You're assuming that they're assuming. That's a lot of assuming. If they cared, they would ask.\n* For them, it might be worth it to have a tenant in the property who will take care of it, they aren't paying for property management, and it's someone who they know and trust. If they're not looking to make a profit on rent, having the property well maintained may be worth more to them than a higher rent, but riskier tenant.\n* They offered - you didn't ask. \n\nNow, IF they do ask, and you hide it, THEN YWBTA, but until then, keep saving for your own place and work on getting ahead. They are probably aware you don't have generational wealth or help, and buying a home is an expensive and difficult thing anymore for most single income earners. Don't take advantage of the situation, but use it to get in the position to get your own place like they are helping you do - in other words, don't go blowing your money on other things (newer cars, too many expensive nights out, etc), live on a budget and get that savings beefed up ASAP.", "NTA.  They offered, you accepted.  Their lives may be enhanced by their generosity.  (they feel better about themselves by giving).  don't ask don't tell", "Absolutely NTA. I fail to see why you think they are doing this because of what they think about your finances. You are a friend of their daughter for 20 years. They can trust you to be a good tenant. They can trust you to pay your rent. They can trust you to not trash the place. All of this costs them a lot more if they were to help someone else. Letting you live there is helping them just as much it is helping you.\n\nAlso, if you're living in North America in HCOL cities, 6 figures is not enough. People who make comfortably to afford their own home in HCOL areas do not say they make 6 figures anymore. You really cannot afford million dollar house if you're on the low end of 6 figures.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
