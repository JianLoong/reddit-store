Minutes later they were hit.\n\nHe was very seriously injured, but suffered no brain damage, and was expected to make a full recovery.

I know so many people who broke a bone as a kid and the parent just thought they were being dramatic. My friends mum didn't believe me when I sprained my wrist at her house. Just because the kids dad thinks he turned out fine, doesn't mean he actually did. I mean I'd say that he didn't considering he doesn't think its an issue for his kids not to wear seatbelts.

My SO barely managed to avoid it, and please note the situation wasn't his fault in the first place: the truck was going slow and he was ready to pass them, had the turn signal on and started to pull left when a speeding motorcycle appeared right next to us. He couldn't continue pulling left because of the biker, he had to break suddenly and fast, avoiding the truck by only a few meters. I swear none of us saw the biker until it was right besides us and it took him barely any time to disappear again, he was going so fast. We pulled over and sat there for five solid minutes hyperventilating that we almost hit a kid.\n\nIt didn't matter the truck went slow. It didn't matter it was a 20 min ride for us.
