So it is taken very serious because it is deadly if in an accident.", "You unbelievably horrid uncle for wanting to keep your nieces and nephew safe from harm. Absolutely NTA", "Nta here in the uk if you don\u2019t have your kids buckled in appropriately and you get caught you can get a fine loose your license etc that\u2019s just legal side but what if something had happened and a kid got hurt or died I think your brother would have a completely different view then \u2026.. he doesn\u2019t like your rules you don\u2019t drive his kids anywhere ever", "Nta. Brother would probably blame you if kids were harmed in an accident.", "My dad was buddies with all the local cops so we got off even though it was very illegal. Small town logic I guess.", "I would never drive with the kids not buckled in. \n\nYour brother has a discipline problem with his kids, and that isn't surprising since he is blaming you and not his kids.", "NTA\n\nYou're right bro, I\u2019m a terrible guardian. I\u2019ll never drive your kids anywhere again.", "This is perfection.", "Me too.  The car rolled down a cliff we walked away badly shaken but without a scratch because we were all wearing seatbelts.", "Neither need to change lol, duck is a world class insult", "Many who survived the seatbelless times without a scratch thinks it was no big deal\u2026..", "I wouldn't outright ban the kids from your car from a one time occurrence. They are kids. At those ages, it's the parents fault for not instilling proper safety and respect. \n\nIn my state, the driver is responsible for all passengers under 18 in their car to wear seatbelts or be properly restrained in an appropriate car seat.", "Yup, my policy exactly. The car doesn\u2019t start until everyone is safe.", "This 1000%!!!!!\n\nNTA, you did the absolute right thing OP, because IF anything had happened you would have been liable for ANYONE in your vehicle not wearing a seatbelt.\ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude31\n\nAny anyway - your vehicle, your rules. Simple as!\nAnyone doesn't like it, they're free to walk! \ud83e\udd23", "Niblings is an adorable word, I\u2019m going to start using it now. See if anyone recognizes it lol. Anyway I agree about my brother\u2019s disregard for my nibling\u2019s safety, but they\u2019re his kids not mine.", "Also it is punctuality to SUMMER CAMP. Not school or a doctor's appointment. What did they miss? The start of kickball or something come on. And I worked at a summer camp. While yes, it's annoying to check in late kids, I'd rather have late, alive kids, then a phone call saying 3 of my campers were injured in a car accident.", "Yup, but she\u2019s a crafty little one and managed to unclip the buckle.", "If you'd had an accident and the kids got hurt, it'd be on your insurance, not his.", "Very illegal? Drunk driving is very illegal. Right?", "Careful there, Duck is a term of greeting or endearment in some parts of the UK! \ud83e\udd23", "Same here, and that goes for adults as well. A long time ago, I once had a friend say that he didn't mind the risk, and I told him, \"I'm not worried about you. I don't really care if you fly through my windshield. I just don't want your un-seatbelted ass to hit me in the head on the way.\"", "It is also disregard for your safety. An unrestrained nibling bouncing around the inside of a car during a crash could also injure you.", "I\u2019m aware of the risks, which is why I\u2019m so strict about safety in my car. I thought OC was commenting on my childhood story? Seatbelts are mandatory nearly everywhere now so it\u2019s kind of a moot point? Idk.", "And brother probably would have been furious that they weren't belted up.", "as if being 15 minutes late to summer camp really made a big problem.   \n\nNTA.\n\nI rode in the back of the truck too as a kid, and we all might be ok, but some of us got our heads bumped once or twice.  Nobody ever took me to a Dr over them... so if you don't look for a concussion, then you don't have one.", "I gave you my input and you did the right thing. Don't let brother guilt you", "We all rolled around in cars with no seatbelts. However times and laws are different.  You did the right thing.  \nSince you can't discipline his kids , next time is a no for help.", "Ooff, that unlocked a childhood memory. I once stood up while the truck was moving, fell, and banged my head so hard I saw stars for two days. Strangely enough, no one in my family ever got a concussion, avoiding the doctor like the plague *definitely* had nothing to do with it.", "Better to be 15 minutes late to summer camp than to have to go to a funeral (or 3)", "My answer when someone says, \"we did it and turned out fine\" is always, yeah and the ones that died aren't here to tell us their story. Like they made it a law for a reason, it saves lives (my best friend growing up wasn't buckled in and a drunk driver hit the car he was in so hard they rolled several times in the ditch...first responders found him dead upon arrival). \n\nHeck I drove my neighbours daughter (40's) the other week and refused to move my vehicle until she buckled in, let alone kids."]}
