Now, this city is pretty expensive, so he's got a roommate \\[26F\\] who was an acquaintance of his from when we were in university. I've met this person twice before, but I've never more than 5 minutes or so with her. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 had to leave for work at one point but I had the day off, so I stayed with my friend to hang out for a while. His roommate ended up hanging out with us too, and while we were chatting the conversation turned to our romantic lives with some comments here and there about our sex lives (not really as open as my friend and I would have been if it were just us or just us and my fianc\u00e9 though). \n\nNow, I should note here that my fianc\u00e9 is Asian (half Japanese and half Korean). At one point after my friend mentioned that he had hooked up with a guy the night before moving, my friend's roommate looked at me and said \"So is what they say true?\" I wasn't sure what she meant, so I asked her what she was asking. She then said \"You know, is what they say about Asian guys true?\" \n\nThat really pissed me off. I mean, for one, my fianc\u00e9's dick size is not something I want to talk to a virtual stranger about, plus it's obviously fucked up to ask about his size just to see if he fits with some racial stereotype or not. So, I said \"You're a nosy racist bitch, aren't you?\"\n\nShe got super upset, looked like she was about to cry, called me a bitch, then ran off to her room. My friend was kind of upset with me for \"disturbing the peace\" with his roommate by being so aggressive with what I said, but he also acknowledged that her question was fucked up.

My sympathy goes to you, obviously, for the racism / exotification of it all. But my sympathy also goes to your friend who\u2019s now gotta live with this fragile woman who\u2019s been called out. He\u2019s gonna have to deal with her trying to disrespect you and excuse her statement to make her feel better about herself. That\u2019s super annoying. But I can\u2019t think of anything short of tone-policing you to get a different outcome (I.e. \u201cwhat an interesting, racially charged thing to ask!

It may not have been intended to be racist, just socially inept. I lived in Korea for a few years, had many very kind Korean friends and lovers (though I\u2019m a straight guy so never saw any Korean penises), and overall enjoyed my time there, despite the Koreans at times being extremely xenophobic/racist themselves, especially if local men saw me hanging out with Korean ladies. \n\nAnyway, a white female co worker had had a fling with a local man and made the comment she wasn\u2019t happy with the guy\u2019s genital size. I didn\u2019t see it as racist, maybe a bit inappropriate, but she was just expressing her opinion that she liked a larger portion, so preferred Caucasian men. \n\nI\u2019m just curious, if your fianc\u00e9 was from Congo (apparently the largest sized men in the world, according to studies), and she\u2019d asked if it was true, would you have been so offended? Or taken it differently? Perhaps with some secret pride at her expressing envy in a ham-fisted (no pun intended) way? \n\nI\u2019m not saying she\u2019s not obnoxious and ignorant, as that seems pretty clear from what you\u2019ve described, I just question whether that particular talking point was attempted from a racist mindset or from listening to too many stereotypes. Just my opinion, not saying it\u2019s infallible. \n\nPeace to you and your fianc\u00e9.", "ESH. \n\nShe sucks for asking inappropriate sexual questions of someone she has never met about someone who wasn\u2019t in the room. \n\nYou suck for an extreme reaction. There are much more tactful ways to respond and still put someone in their place. Your friend just started a lease with this person and you will probably have to see this person again.

You\u2019re not in the wrong for being an ally & standing up against racial stereotypes, but you really did go 0 to 60 real fast, as some else put it.\n\nIt\u2019s often more effective to make a situation awkward on purpose as opposed to getting angry - something like \u201cdid you seriously need to say that?\u201d with a disgusted look is often a lot more helpful because you\u2019ve made them realize that their comments are not appropriate while also not stopping down to their level.", "Yta", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
