{"id": 20191, "submission_id": "14epp9j", "title": "AITA for refusing to wet myself for my sister-in-law's wedding?", "selftext": "The wedding happened in a little river - and I mean *in* the river, in the water. The minister, bride (who's my husband's sister) and groom stood on a little strip of land so they were not wet, but all attendants were expected to stand in knee-deep rushing water for the whole ceremony. I'm sure it made for great photos, but I personally really dislike mud, germs, insects and whatever diseases are found in that stream.\n\nThe kids who couldn't easily stand in water that might be as tall as their whole body were left in ankle-deep water nearby with a couple older women. When I refused to remove my shoes, socks and pull up my dress pants, my husband offered that I stay with the kids. I said no, I refuse to walk into that water, even if it's \"just\" ankle-deep. Apparently most people there knew about the water thing, but *I* didn't. My husband knew but claims he \"forgot to tell me\".\n\nThe ceremony could have easily moved forward with me standing on the shore, just a few feet away from the kids, but nooooOOOoo. The bride and groom apparently refused to start until *every* person was in the water, and my husband waded in the water back and forth between his sister and me to mediate - my husband was becoming visibly angry at me the longer it went on and kept acting like **I** was in the wrong. The bride and groom eventually relented and the ceremony went on, delayed by maybe 30 mins - in the after-party, I felt that I was being avoided by everyone else, including my husband.\n\nThat was nearly 2 weeks ago. My husband was stone-faced and refusing to talk to me about it or about anything at all for several days - and when he started talking again, he refused to address the wedding beyond telling me that I \"humiliated\" him in front of his family and he refuses to talk about it any longer. Things like \"I will get really angry if you keep bringing up this topic. Put it to rest and I will try to forget what you did.\" BUT I FEEL LIKE I DID NOTHING WRONG! I feel blindsided, because if I'd been told in advance what the wedding entailed, I'd have faked a stomach bug and not attended the damn thing at ALL!!\n\nAITA?\n\n[EDIT] Clearing up some misconceptions:\n\nI'm a man. My husband and I are a gay couple.\n\nTowels were provided, but no way to wash your feet from the mud and germs. A lot of guests had a change of clothes, some removed part of their outfits and put the lower bits back on after drying themselves, others decided to get wet and remain in wet clothes; but the bride and groom did not expect everyone to stay wet all evening.\n\nThe level of the water keeps getting higher and higher in the comments, so to be clear, it was not that deep. From where I stood, I could see women up to their knees or lower thighs for the smaller ones, and to taller guests, it reached their shins. I am 5 foot 2 so I would have been deeper than shin-level. I did not see anyone fall into the water or even seriously stumble, so the fears of guests not knowing how to swim are misplaced.\n\nMy husband knew about this requirement in advance as he coordinated with his sister, and he claims it was by mistake that I was not made aware until the day of. He's accepted blame for failing to inform me, that is not in question, but he remains upset about the whole event. I do not know his exact feelings on the topic beyond the fact he accused me of humiliating him in front of his family; he refuses to actually discuss and get closure. I wanted to hear from him a form of apology for getting outwardly angry at me but not at his sister when I felt like I was being reasonable. He was getting agitated every time I tried to talk about it, so now we do not discuss this topic. My husband *still talks to me* overall, he calmed down, he acts pretty much normal day to day and is even affectionate. Just, he wants this topic to be buried and not addressed again, while I feel very frustrated because I feel like I was treated unfairly and then blamed wrongly. His family will definitely remember me as the \"troublemaker\" and probably think I am a disrespectful person, and I would like my husband to acknowledge that I was done dirty and to defend my reputation in front of his family.\n\nI admit fault in that I could have walked away and waited in the car. In retrospect, the bride and groom wanted me in the water because I was the only person on the shore and it was not as picturesque. They should have communicated that, but I should also have understood it. Even if not, it would have been the more mature thing to do, remove myself from the situation so the ceremony could go on and the photos could be as pretty as the couple wanted them to be.", "created_utc": 1687300755, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14epp9j/aita_for_refusing_to_wet_myself_for_my/", "score": 1805, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That's information you need before the wedding. Like, well before the wedding.\n\n Firstly, whatever clothes you wear will probably be ruined. \n\nSecondly, you need to bring towels and a change of pants.\n\nThirdly, it's perfectly reasonable not to want to stand in river/creek water for any reason at all. \n\nYour spouse is a massive AH for not telling you in advance, and the couple are massive AHs for refusing to go on without you in the water. \n\nDon't feel guilty, this is on them(mostly your spouse) and not on you.", "NTA. And frankly, I don\u2019t think he forgot to tell you. He purposely didn\u2019t tell you figuring they\u2019d get you to go along with it when you found out in the moment.", "NTA he didn\u2019t forget anything. He knew you wouldn\u2019t do it and thought he could use peer- and social pressure to force you to do it. \n\nOnly you went Nope. Good for you.  \n\nBe proud of that shiny steely spine.", "Wait, so your husband is allowed to tell you that you \"humiliated\" him but you aren't allowed to tell him how appalling *his* behavior (both at the wedding and his subsequent treatment of you) has been? He's allowed to insist that you be silent and only if you comply with his wishes, then *he* will forgive *you*? And if you don't, it will be your fault that he gets angry???\n\nNTA, NTA, NTA. And wow, that's a whole bunch of red flags from your husband before we even get to the truly bizarre behavior from your SIL\n\nYou do not invite people to a dress-up event and then demand that they get dirty. Period. Even at something like a lake party, not everyone needs to get *in* the lake. If it mattered that much to her, then it was incumbent upon her to make sure *everyone* knew about it ahead of time, not just \"most\" people.\n\nBut back to your husband...unless this was wildly out-of-character for him (in which case, it's still completely unacceptable but perhaps worthy of a second chance *if* he calms down soon), I'm really concerned what other kinds of abusive and manipulative behavior he engages in. Please read this book to see if other behaviors sound familiar: https://ia800108.us.archive.org/30/items/LundyWhyDoesHeDoThat/Lundy_Why-does-he-do-that.pdf", "NTA\n\nYour husband is an asshole for not telling you that the wedding would require you to stand in the water. \n\nBride and groom should have just moved on without you.", "That was a no win situation for you and your husband, although he's at fault for not saying anything. Maybe he didn't say anything as he knew you would pull out. \n\nDaft idea having everyone in the river.", "NTA. It\u2019s one thing to have a wedding by the river, but *in* it??? And expecting only the guests should be in the water? That\u2019s too much. They can have their wedding however they want, but not at the inconvenience of the guests. It sounds like your husband didn\u2019t \u201cforget\u201d to tell you, he refused to because he knew you wouldn\u2019t go. Let\u2019s not forget the fucking BALLS on your husband to not only give you the silent treatment, but to harbor anger towards you for not accepting a stupid fucking wedding demand. If he is still mad at you 2 weeks later, he\u2019s the one who needs to let it go. Honestly, if anyone is the AH here, it\u2019s your husband who didn\u2019t even give you a chance to not go.", "NTA like\u2026 good for them if that\u2019s what they wanna do. But not everyone wants to spend the rest of the evening wet? Also you know could possibly get sick, cut your foot on something. Heaven forbid anyone falls.", "NTA this should have been made clear to all the wedding guest ahead of time and you could have chosen to nope out of the whole ceremony.", "NTA. What a bizarre request of their wedding guests. Personally, I probably wouldn't have gone in the first place. But unfortunately your husband didn't inform you of their bizarre request, so you couldn't make that choice yourself. That seems like a pretty big thing to \"forget\" to tell someone. I'm not sure if I would have sucked it up and just went in the water. I know I'd probably be pissed if someone surprised me with that. River water often stinks and I wouldn't wanna ruin my clothes or be wet for the rest of the night. Did they at least provide towels and wet wipes for everyone?", "NTA. If you're phobic about germs or water, your husband should understand that. You should probably have explained to the bride & groom that it is a phobia, and that would have likely made things go much smoother. But overall, your husband is a huge AH, and you have nothing to apologize for. He should be apologizing to you.", "NTA.  Who the f expects people to stand in the water for their wedding ceremony, I love the water, but no way in hell am I going to stand in the water for a wedding or any other kind of ceremony.  Sounds like your husband didn't tell you on purpose and just thought they'd be able to manipulate you into it when you got there.  I think it's actually quite rude of them to expect everyone to stand in the water, people have skin conditions, injuries that could be exacerbated by it.", "That title -- I went to a whole different place until I realized it meant your standing in the water.\n\nOf course you're not the asshole. Only assholes here are the ones trying to dictate wedding guests get in a creek with no warning. Fuck them with wrong end of a grill brush.", "You are SO NTA. \nWhat a ridiculous request on the part of the bride and groom especially since they were t willing to do it themselves.\n\nHow anyone could render any judgment other than NTA baffles me", "You know what I think you did wrong? \n\nNot leaving as soon as the nonsense started up. \n\nWhat you did right was not give in! \n\nBut what are you going to do about the way your husband is behaving? Because hers said he might not get over his humiliation at your refusal to bow to his will.", "NTA\nYour husband should have taken the blame with his sister if he really forgot to tell you. I can't imagine why anyone would go along with this. Maybe at a beach wedding, but a river? Nope.", "NTA.  Stupid wedding idea.  People should get over themselves.", "NTA. I don't know why, but I can't help thinking that your husband didn't just forget to tell you. That's not the kind of thing that you forget about.", "Nta \n\nI think your husband tried to surprise you into it. He failed. He doesn\u2019t want you to place blame and prefers to blame you quietly.\n\nI do think it\u2019s important you reach out and apologize to your SIL for the scene, not knowing in advance, and not thinking of moving away for the pictures in the moment.\n\nHad you known you could\u2019ve brought flip flops and prepared mentally. I don\u2019t like going into murky wild water barefoot either, no judgment. SIL could\u2019ve also prepared for anyone not wanting to go in at least enough to know they want them out or off the frame for video and pics. It\u2019s ridiculous to wait for guests at a wedding, let alone 3 to pressure you. That said, these are things you need to let die on this thread - don\u2019t get into the blame game.\n\nI am suspicious how your husband is handling things may be a larger issue. Red flag on the pressuring you and not informing you in advance, and now blaming you one sidedly for a situation he had more of a part in creating.", "NTA \n\nThis was on your husband for forgetting. And I agree with the assessment he could have admitted his fault in the situation and took the heat. He either thought you would have caved in the moment (which is kind of hilarious because you seem to have a beautifully shiny spine and I'm sure he knows this) or did legitimately forget and would rather embarrass you then embarrass himself. \n\nAlso, this was his family. If he took heat and admitted his error, they were more likely to forgive \"one of their own\" then an \"outsider\" quicker. \n\nAnd honestly all the E S H saying that you could have just stood in the water with the kids, are missing the point that it's still standing in water, feet and toes caked in mud, little water creatures washing over you lol\n\nAnd when you say he wanted you to stand with the kids, do you have kids with him? Because how he's handling this situation would be a terrible example to them if you do.", "NTA your husband is, your sil is, the concept is insane. Tell your husband it wouldn\u2019t have happened if he\u2019d told you. If he forgot\u2026tough. If he deliberately didn\u2019t tell you, he is a major AH. Who wants to ruin clothing for someone else\u2019s whim?", "OMG, I think this is the absolutely most batcrap crazy wedding theme or whatever this was supposed to be idea I have ever heard. Sweet Jesus in a manger, standing in a river to get married?! NTA but your husband and his family are. In a river huh? Wow. Just wow.", "INFO: does your husband usually hide stuff like this from you or is this a one time thing? \n\nOP, can you swim?
