His girlfriend and I connected on Facebook around a month or two ago, she\u2019s a very nice person. I\u2019ve never really talked to any of his partners before as they weren\u2019t serious. His current girlfriend (Katie) asked if it would be okay if she and my ex (Daniel) took our daughter out for the day. I said yes, no problem. She hadn\u2019t met my daughter at this point. We arranged to meet up in a local coffee shop and I took my daughter along with me, just to ease any anxieties she may have around Katie as she\u2019s a new person in my daughters life. The meet went great. We talked a lot, there was no awkwardness at all, my daughter even gave her a hug before we left which is rare as she\u2019s not really a touchy lovey person with anyone except for me and her grandma. \nI text my partner (Jordan) to let him know I was about to leave and I\u2019d be home shortly.

You are coparenting with your ex boyfriend, and you should do whatever is necessary to make that a comfortable relationship.

OP meeting with Katie  with the daughter there, having a nice interaction and showing they can be friendly really eases the child's mind.

If/when he wants to see our daughter he calls her on her iPad and he says \u201chey do you want me to come pick you up and we can go to the park or McDonalds\u201d. He does see her, but not as much as he should. His girlfriend reached out to me and asked if I\u2019d be okay with her and my ex taking our daughter out for the day, I said yes. She suggested us meeting up prior to them taking our daughter out just so I can get to know her and stuff", "Oh he knew about us meeting her, he\u2019s known ever since it was arranged which was late last month/early this month. He\u2019s said it was weird since day one, but yesterday he just went in a mood with me over it", "Exactly. We were with her for maybe 2ish hours, honestly I was enjoying being out of the house having a little break.

A few people have said that\u2019s weird", "Not at all, you did what a mature and responsible parent does, which is have a civilised meeting with your co-parent's new partner, to make sure you are OK with them, your daughter is comfortable, and the new partner feels at ease to communicate with you. Co-parenting is so much easier when you have a good relationship with your co-parent's new partner, and it helps the kids settle. When my co-parent got a new partner and wanted to introduce her to the kids, I arranged to have lunch with her. Like you, we got along fine, which was a weight off my shoulders, and the fact that we got along well helped normalise things for the kids when I dropped them off or when we met up at school functions etc.", "He\u2019s being an insecure weirdo.", "Also why wouldn\u2019t you meet up with your exes family? My brother in law - first wife\u2019s brother - had learning difficulties, something I had direct experience with and helped him with. After the divorce I met him privately a few times just to be an ear for him as his dad \u201cdoesn\u2019t believe in ADHD\u201d (like it\u2019s bloody Santa Claus). Relationships with the exes family are not as uncommon as all that.", "I'm actually still really good friends with my brother's ex, and she's married to someone else now. So I am the 'exs family.' The point is, I'm not the ex  \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f.", "So what you did makes even more sense. This woman coould end up being her step mum and having a working relationship to discuss school, trips, vacations etc with one of her other parents makes life so much easier and less conflicting for your daughter. Kids see everything so she knows you and your ex don't get on. Having someone she can trust in that camp is so much better.\n\nAs for your other half, just tell him you needed to meet her make sure she's not a serial killer or going to kidnap your daughter on this trip. Throw worst case scenario at him. That usually wakes them up. Subtle goes over some people's head lol.", "Oh god \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05 good luck with all that", "It sounds like Katie\u2019s presence could be a good thing if you don\u2019t get along with your ex, as she could be your primary point of contact. \n\nI think I would recommend having a firm conversation with Jordan and laying down some boundaries. I would also bring up that him putting his phone on Do Not Disturb because you\u2019re doing something he doesn\u2019t like really isn\u2019t an ok way of dealing with that.", "Yeah, this is weird honey. And I mean all of it, from your current boyfriend's reaction to the fact that you met your ex's new girlfriend on her request without him present.", "You acted as any responsible (co) parent would.", "I just wanted my daughter to see that I was okay and comfortable around Katie so she would be too. It was a meet strictly for my daughter, and I wish I\u2019d met Katie sooner. She\u2019s a lovely person", "He is and I don\u2019t understand why. If I had any ounce of love or anything for my ex I would\u2019ve gone back to him long ago. I\u2019m not even interested in speaking to him\ud83d\ude02", "Her bf reaction is definitely weird, but taking her daughter to meet someone who could potentially become her stepmom and be involved in her life\u2026.not weird at all. In any way shape or form", "Thank you", "Stepmom is a big word. Dad is not very involved. Dad and girlfriend have been together for 2 years, and yet, GF and kid had never met before... To me, this is weird.", "She doesn\u2019t live in this part of the country, she lives 2 hours away. My ex usually travels to her house, but she came to visit him this time and she reached out to me to see if I wanted to meet up with her before she met my child. She asked if I\u2019d like her to bring my ex along, I declined because me and him don\u2019t get along at all. And don\u2019t call me honey please, it\u2019s very patronising.", "That\u2019s why I said **potential.** Also, just because dad doesn\u2019t have full custody, doesn\u2019t mean he is not involved. OP states in comments that her daughter calls her dad and speaks to him regularly and has her most weekends. It\u2019s also not weird for new partners to NOT meet or be introduced to sais children until their spouses are sure the relationship is serious enough and they plan on being apart of the child life. That way the kid isn\u2019t Heart-broken if they form an attachment if the relationship doesn\u2019t work out. That could months or even years- depends in the parents. Obviously everyone involved feels that now is the time to introduce OP\u2019s daughter. This is a healthy co parent relationship going on. \n\nSo no, nothing about this- except for her partners reaction- is weird.", "She lives quite far away, like 2 hours away. And she doesn\u2019t usually come down here to visit my ex, he goes to her. She was here this time so we arranged to meet up", "That doesn\u2019t really change anything. Either way, you\u2019re doing a great job and it\u2019s dope that you want your child to have a relationship with this women- considering it does seem to be getting serious between her and your ex. \n\nIt\u2019s great they finally got to meet, maybe she\u2019ll travel to your ex instead of the other way around. She could have been doing that out of respect for  you and your ex if you guys  didn\u2019t want them to meet right away", "I think it was just because of work lol, but she works from home now so she\u2019s able to come down here more frequently. I had no idea they were together until march/April last year"]}
