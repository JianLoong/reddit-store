He didn\u2019t come because he and I do not get along at all, and it would\u2019ve made things awkward. The meet was so my daughter was comfortable, it wasn\u2019t about my ex.\n\nEdit number two - for the people that think it\u2019s weird they\u2019ve been together for two years and I\u2019ve never met her \u2014 we\u2019ve only just met because she lives 2 hours away and my ex used to go to her house to visit her. She\u2019s only just started coming to our area to visit him which is why she reached out to me. I wasn\u2019t aware of their relationship until last year.\n\nEdit number three - I did tell my boyfriend about meeting up with Katie. He\u2019s known about it since day one.\n\nFor context I have a 7 year old with my ex, and two more children with my current partner.\nMy ex has been with his current girlfriend for 2 years now, we broke up when our daughter was 1. His girlfriend and I connected on Facebook around a month or two ago, she\u2019s a very nice person. I\u2019ve never really talked to any of his partners before as they weren\u2019t serious. His current girlfriend (Katie) asked if it would be okay if she and my ex (Daniel) took our daughter out for the day. I said yes, no problem. She hadn\u2019t met my daughter at this point. We arranged to meet up in a local coffee shop and I took my daughter along with me, just to ease any anxieties she may have around Katie as she\u2019s a new person in my daughters life. The meet went great. We talked a lot, there was no awkwardness at all, my daughter even gave her a hug before we left which is rare as she\u2019s not really a touchy lovey person with anyone except for me and her grandma. \nI text my partner (Jordan) to let him know I was about to leave and I\u2019d be home shortly. He asked where I was and I told him we were at a coffee shop. He asked who I was with, I told him Katie and my daughter. He text me back \u201cand Daniel?\u201d I said no, just Katie and Georgia (daughter). He responded \u201ck.\u201d and then put his phone on do not disturb so I couldn\u2019t get in touch with him. I got home and he wouldn\u2019t really speak to me. Before I went to bed I asked him again; what\u2019s wrong? He said it\u2019s weird I went to meet my exes girlfriend, I\u2019m trying to be best friends with her and I wouldn\u2019t like it if he went to meet people from his exes family. But he doesn\u2019t have children with his ex, so there would be no need for him to meet up with them. He\u2019s the only one that has a problem with me meeting her, he thinks I\u2019m doing it to get close to my ex (I absolutely am not). He still isn\u2019t really speaking to me and honestly I don\u2019t know what the issue is. Is it weird I went to meet up with her before allowing my daughter to go on a day trip with her?

Co-parenting is so much easier when you have a good relationship with your co-parent's new partner, and it helps the kids settle. When my co-parent got a new partner and wanted to introduce her to the kids, I arranged to have lunch with her.

This woman coould end up being her step mum and having a working relationship to discuss school, trips, vacations etc with one of her other parents makes life so much easier and less conflicting for your daughter. Kids see everything so she knows you and your ex don't get on. Having someone she can trust in that camp is so much better.\n\nAs for your other half, just tell him you needed to meet her make sure she's not a serial killer or going to kidnap your daughter on this trip.

OP states in comments that her daughter calls her dad and speaks to him regularly and has her most weekends. It\u2019s also not weird for new partners to NOT meet or be introduced to sais children until their spouses are sure the relationship is serious enough and they plan on being apart of the child life. That way the kid isn\u2019t Heart-broken if they form an attachment if the relationship doesn\u2019t work out. That could months or even years- depends in the parents. Obviously everyone involved feels that now is the time to introduce OP\u2019s daughter.

She could have been doing that out of respect for  you and your ex if you guys  didn\u2019t want them to meet right away", "I think it was just because of work lol, but she works from home now so she\u2019s able to come down here more frequently. I had no idea they were together until march/April last year", "Your partners reaction makes no sense - you were meeting with someone who would be present if not partially responsible for your child's care in future situations. A meeting is normal. \n\nWhat's NOT normal (or healthy) is being given the silent treatment for being a responsible parent. I would consider this reaction a marinara flag.", "Did your partner end the relationship with his ex or did she end it?\n\nOne reason that the he could only picture having contact with an ex is because one wants them back, could be that he wants his ex back.\n\nNTA", "NTA.

Your partner and you need to have a serious talk about the future of your relationship. By his logic, he will always be distant and possibly decent to your ex? He\u2019s getting involved with a family, you and your ex will always be in each other\u2019s lives as well as both your partners. There\u2019s no opting in or out of certain aspects. Even if your relationship with your ex were awful, still in your life bc shared child. \n\nIf your current partner plans to maintain an issue with this when everyone else is getting along and co-parenting\u2026 whatever you like about him isn\u2019t worth it if he thinks there should a strain between everyone.", "NTA, I think you handled the situation maturely with the transition of your daughter meeting someone her father is involved with.  I do understand why your partner is upset you should have atleast told him the plan and why you were doing it.", "NTA\nSounds responsible", "Certainly NTA!!!\n\nYou\u2019re being a responsible and thoughtful parent by easing them into meeting eachother this way and helping alleviate any anxieties. \n\nNot to sound paranoid but what I would be questioning is *why* he doesn\u2019t want you associating with her. Sounds a little suspicious to me. \n\nAnyways, he\u2019s being ridiculous and need to grow up. \n\nP.S. Keep being a great mom!", "Your BFs the one with the problem. You are doing exactly what any mother would do- meet the person that is going to be around your kid! If he can\u2019t understand that- you got biggest problems than meeting up with your ex\u2019s GF. Your Not The Ass!", "Nta your partner sounds like a walking red flag", "Major insecurity issue here and a bit of a jealousy red flag. He needs to realise that you are with him because you love him and not with your ex because reasons. It\u2019s childish to be honest. You had a valid reason for meeting your ex\u2019s serious gf as you and ex have a kid together.", "OP you are doing a wonderful job co parenting, Your boyfriend sounds like he is a very insecure man. If he points out every one of his exs to you when your out I feel like he\u2019s trying to make you jealous or uncomfortable. Idk who needs to tell this grown assed toddler that OP is a mother, and her child and her child\u2019s safety will be her priority. Your exs partner asked if they could take your daughter out, you agreed but wanted to meet her first that is smart and being a good mom. It allows all 3 of you a peace of mind. You and your ex don\u2019t speak to each other but your system seems to work for you guys. I\u2019d just straight up ask why is he jealous over a guy who you can\u2019t stand? I\u2019d also be blunt as possible. The reality is your ex is going to be semi around as he is your daughters father, to make it easier on your daughter you are civil and polite. And as for your exs girlfriend (I think that you two a building a great relationship that  benefits your daughter) she has given you no reason to be unkind to her so why would you be? If he can\u2019t handle that then he isn\u2019t the guy for you or your daughter. He has zero reason to be a jealous pinecone.", "NTA. I had my oldest daughter really young and her father and I stayed on friendly terms for the most part and I was usually on even more friendly terms with his girlfriends. One of his ex girlfriends is now considered a close family friend and was even a guest at my wedding to my current husband. There is nothing wrong with what you did.", "INFO: Wait, why wasn't Daniel at this meetup?", "NTA, I met up with my (at the time) partner's ex before I met their children. It's totally normal to want to meet them if they're going to be spending time with your kids. She had a new partner and he was fine with it. Your partner needs to get over himself.", "NTA you did nothing wrong and your partner is dumb.", "NTA\n\nI can not think of a better way of introducing kids to the ex's SO. Your BF is a complete AH. Dump him quickly. He is going to be very controlling. You did right by your child.", "NTA - You are doing the best thing for your daughter by being on good terms with your ex's partner. I have no idea how doing this could be construed as you trying to get closer to your ex. It only benefits your child to have a friendly coparenting situation. I also think it is really nice that the girlfriend reached out to you at all. It shows they also have your daughters well-being as being important.  \n\n\n\"My daughter is going to be around this person whether I am nice to them or not. Especially for my daughters sake, I would rather have an open and friendly relationship with any serious partner he has. I am not looking to be best friends, or even necessarily friends. I want my daughter to be safe, comfortable, and happy, and I want any adult that is in her life to feel comfortable coming to me with any concerns.\"", "What the hell?!? It\u2019s totally reasonable to meet your ex\u2019s new partner who is going to be involved with your daughters life. That\u2019s a great co-parenting relationship right there. Green flags all the way. \n\nIt\u2019s really weird that your current partner is having issues with this. Totally immature. NTA", "NTA and it's time to have a discussion with him if he's mature enough to be with someone who has a kid. Whether he likes it or not, the ex will always be in their life if there are kids from a previous relationship. It's also absolutely right for you to meet up with the ex's current partner to make sure they seem ok before just sending your kid off with them.", "[removed]", "[removed]", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

I cannot cannot CANNOTTTTTT stand her dad whatsoever, but I\u2019ve never bad mouthed him in front of her. It was Katie\u2019s idea for us to meet before she took our daughter out and honestly I really admire her for that. She\u2019s a great woman, I wish we\u2019d met sooner.

You never mentioned this meet up to him until you were leaving the coffee shop? \n\nWhile what you did was totally fine and great parenting.

Not your problem that your partner is not on the same level with you.", "Honestly, it wouldn't even matter that he doesn't have kids with the ex.  I'm still friends with one of my brother's exes.  They were together for 15 years.  The two of them don't talk anymore (they're both now married to other people), but she and I meet up for coffee occasionally and stay in touch through SM.
