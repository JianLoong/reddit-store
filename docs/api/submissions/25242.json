He didn\u2019t come because he and I do not get along at all, and it would\u2019ve made things awkward. The meet was so my daughter was comfortable, it wasn\u2019t about my ex.\n\nEdit number two - for the people that think it\u2019s weird they\u2019ve been together for two years and I\u2019ve never met her \u2014 we\u2019ve only just met because she lives 2 hours away and my ex used to go to her house to visit her. She\u2019s only just started coming to our area to visit him which is why she reached out to me. I wasn\u2019t aware of their relationship until last year.\n\nEdit number three - I did tell my boyfriend about meeting up with Katie. He\u2019s known about it since day one.\n\nEdit four - for Christ sake. Why are people picking at me for meeting Katie without my ex being there? He and I absolutely do not get along at all, if he came there would\u2019ve been a horrible atmosphere and possibly an argument. Katie was fine with him not being there, Daniel was fine with not being there (he didn\u2019t wanna come anyway). So I\u2019ve no clue why people of Reddit have an issue with it.\n\nEdit five - yes. I have full custody. That\u2019s never been a problem, we\u2019ve never had to go to court for custody, not sure why people are bothered by this.\n\nFor context I have a 7 year old with my ex, and two more children with my current partner.\nMy ex has been with his current girlfriend for 2 years now, we broke up when our daughter was 1. His girlfriend and I connected on Facebook around a month or two ago, she\u2019s a very nice person. I\u2019ve never really talked to any of his partners before as they weren\u2019t serious. His current girlfriend (Katie) asked if it would be okay if she and my ex (Daniel) took our daughter out for the day. I said yes, no problem. She hadn\u2019t met my daughter at this point. We arranged to meet up in a local coffee shop and I took my daughter along with me, just to ease any anxieties she may have around Katie as she\u2019s a new person in my daughters life. The meet went great. We talked a lot, there was no awkwardness at all, my daughter even gave her a hug before we left which is rare as she\u2019s not really a touchy lovey person with anyone except for me and her grandma. \nI text my partner (Jordan) to let him know I was about to leave and I\u2019d be home shortly. He asked where I was and I told him we were at a coffee shop. He asked who I was with, I told him Katie and my daughter. He text me back \u201cand Daniel?\u201d I said no, just Katie and Georgia (daughter). He responded \u201ck.\u201d and then put his phone on do not disturb so I couldn\u2019t get in touch with him. I got home and he wouldn\u2019t really speak to me. Before I went to bed I asked him again; what\u2019s wrong? He said it\u2019s weird I went to meet my exes girlfriend, I\u2019m trying to be best friends with her and I wouldn\u2019t like it if he went to meet people from his exes family. But he doesn\u2019t have children with his ex, so there would be no need for him to meet up with them. He\u2019s the only one that has a problem with me meeting her, he thinks I\u2019m doing it to get close to my ex (I absolutely am not). He still isn\u2019t really speaking to me and honestly I don\u2019t know what the issue is. Is it weird I went to meet up with her before allowing my daughter to go on a day trip with her? AITA for trying to get along with her?

When my co-parent got a new partner and wanted to introduce her to the kids, I arranged to have lunch with her.

OP states in comments that her daughter calls her dad and speaks to him regularly and has her most weekends. It\u2019s also not weird for new partners to NOT meet or be introduced to sais children until their spouses are sure the relationship is serious enough and they plan on being apart of the child life. That way the kid isn\u2019t Heart-broken if they form an attachment if the relationship doesn\u2019t work out. That could months or even years- depends in the parents. Obviously everyone involved feels that now is the time to introduce OP\u2019s daughter.

Your partner and you need to have a serious talk about the future of your relationship. By his logic, he will always be distant and possibly decent to your ex? He\u2019s getting involved with a family, you and your ex will always be in each other\u2019s lives as well as both your partners. There\u2019s no opting in or out of certain aspects. Even if your relationship with your ex were awful, still in your life bc shared child. \n\nIf your current partner plans to maintain an issue with this when everyone else is getting along and co-parenting\u2026 whatever you like about him isn\u2019t worth it if he thinks there should a strain between everyone.", "NTA, I think you handled the situation maturely with the transition of your daughter meeting someone her father is involved with.  I do understand why your partner is upset you should have atleast told him the plan and why you were doing it.", "NTA\nSounds responsible", "Certainly NTA!!!\n\nYou\u2019re being a responsible and thoughtful parent by easing them into meeting eachother this way and helping alleviate any anxieties. \n\nNot to sound paranoid but what I would be questioning is *why* he doesn\u2019t want you associating with her.

I have to meet this person before they meet my kid I need to know who\u2019s around my kid and know they r safe I gave him the same respect when I met my now husband he didn\u2019t meet my son until we had been together 8 months and I had my ex meet him first so he knew him and felt comfortable with him around my son there\u2019s nothing wrong with getting along with the people who will be helping in any way to parent ur child it\u2019s btr that y\u2019all get along and work together it\u2019s btr for the kid", "Wow OP you are handling this in a very productive and adult way.

She wasn\u2019t interrogated, the meet was so my daughter could warm up to her before having a day out with her. We had a nice conversation. No interrogation at all. It was Katie\u2019s idea for us to meet up prior to her taking Georgia out. It was for my daughter, not for me or my ex.", "Thank you", "No he\u2019s just insanely immature and insecure", "sounds like you're a rational, compassionate parent and co-parent. your bf needs to go, imo.", "Sounds like things are going well, and your daughter has made a nice new friend \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb your partner will just need to learn to understand this. You're doing fine, mom!", "if your child was comfortable with it being you 3, then it is acceptable IMO. The WHOLE purpose was to make sure she was indeed ok with the new GF. You did that. Good Job Mom!!!", "This makes me wonder if maybe he did sleep with her and then later lied to cover up what was actually a truthful admission. Seems like cheaters always assume that everyone else is just as shady as they are. He's getting bent out of shape after the fact when he knew about it from the start and said nothing? That's some distinctly bizarre behavior, unless it's a guilty conscience working on him. Dude is hiding something. You're definitely NTA and I think you handled it quite well for your daughter's benefit.", "If you told him about it beforehand, then why would he ask if Daniel showed up?

He\u2019s likely projecting his shit onto you. He still has a weird thing for his ex (not saying he\u2019s still into them, but obsessive nonetheless) so he can only view this meeting as trying to stay close to your ex rather than just trying to know the people your kid is around. Your bf has some issues\u2026", "I think it was really thoughtful and kind of you to help facilitate the meeting and to be so conscious of the fact that having your ex there would have made it uncomfortable.

What a lovely example to show your daughter!", "She was completely fine with it, she was excited to have a girls day\n\nThis is the ONLY opinion that should matter to you. IMO you did great.", "Oh wow that is heartbreaking. You are an Angel for protecting those babies", "Thank you, appreciate that!", "YTA. My ex tried pulling the same thing. I told her to go jump. The kids are mine as much as hers and she has no right to meet or approve the people who I introduce to them.", "NTA. You are good mom who puts her daughter's needs first. You have to co-parent with your ex. His girlfriend may be in your daughter's life for years- who knows.  You will also probably speak to the GF about your daughter in the future.   If your current BF does not get this and is upset when you speak to Katie you may need to rethink this relationship..You did nothing wrong.", "Honestly I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the asshole for meeting up with her. You wanted to make sure her and your daughter got to meet and not feel awkward whenever your ex and his girlfriend want to bring her along for a trip. There\u2019s no reason for your bf to get mad or feel some type of way for meeting up with her. I\u2019m pretty sure he would do the same thing if he was in the same position and had a kid with his ex.", "NTA. You and Katie seem like good, decent people. Your partner, however, is giving me weird vibes. This was an extreme reaction to something so minor, and yet so important for the well-being of your child. From your comments, it sounds like he has issues with his ex and is projecting those issues onto you. Not sure how long you've been together and if reactions like this are normal, but I definitely take a step back and look at where you two are as a couple.", "NTA \nI have been with partners who had kids in previous relationships, there is nothing wrong with it. To me, you're doing what is best for your daughter. I have at times been the person of contact between my ex and the mothers of his kids. As a parent you do what is best for you child and not exposing her to a possibly tense situation between you and your ex is one of them. At the end of the day that is all that matters.", "NTA.  The boyfriend has 2 kids of his own with you. He needs broader perspective that doesn't revolve around his own butt cheeks. \n\nPut it to him this way. If for any reason the two of you separated and he got back with his ex, you'd expect to meet her with your mutual children because his proverbial rebounded-ex will be spending time with the youngest 2 kids.  He should WANT you to get along with partners for the sake of his own children. \n\nDo not let him fuel a narrative that goes beyond what this connect with the new partner actually is.", "When I read the headline I assumed it was your ex who had the problem with you meeting his new girlfriend. The fact that it's your current partner surprised me or at least his reaction did. You are not doing anything wrong. NTA", "NTA.

I do still think he has some feelings for his ex", "If he got back with his ex she most definitely would not be around my kids at all. She shouted abuse at me in the street while I was with my oldest, and also came into my work and started harassing me and screaming insults across the bar. She\u2019s a very nasty person", "My ex was fine with it, admittedly Katie did say he was nervous about her meeting me but didn\u2019t say why.

I try and speak to him, but he just dismisses me and tells me I\u2019m arguing all the time. I\u2019m trying to have a proper conversation with you dude lol. I\u2019ve given up with him fully now but never stopped our daughter seeing him. She has an iPad so he can contact her and arrange to see her when he calls her", "NTA OP.  Agree with others that you were being a responsible Mother in making sure that your daughter sees that you are comfortable with your Ex's GF so that she could be comfortable too.  It's your partner that's being an insecure AH.\n\nMy story:  I too met my son's father's GF without him 37 years ago.  I met with her to make sure that I would be comfortable and secure that my son would be safe around her.  We had a meaningful conversation and I pressed to assure her that I would never want \"Him\" ever again.  Turns out that meeting became a long term friendship until the day she died.  She had a son by my Ex and her son became my Bonus Son and my son became hers.   Well, she found out why I never wanted to be with my Ex when he did to her what he did to me.   We became each other's support system and gave each other weekend breaks from our sons.  One weekend, she would keep my son and then my daughter too (when I gave birth to her 8 years later) and the following weekend, I would keep her son.  We planned little family affordable trips (single Moms and all) together and generally had each other's back.  Even her sisters thought our friendship was odd but for us, it was all about the kids happiness and well-being and our friendship was just a bonus.", "This is red flag level childhishness. It can't be the first time this kind of controlling insecurity has come it, can it?", "Some platonic connections you make through romantic relationships are too important or strong to discard if the relationship ends, especially when kids are involved. My parents have been divorced for 15 years and my dad is still very close with my mom's brother and my mom is very close with my dad's parents. The bond my mom has with my dad's mother is almost like mother-daughter, because we all lived together during my mom's pregnancy and when I was a baby. \n\nThese things can be hard for the new incoming partners, but they have to either trust their partner or move on!", "Are you seriously that bothered by what a stranger does. Jesus Christ.", "it was for your anxieties more than hers,, obviously. with that amount of drama i wouldnt get use to each other, friends, exc....", "Why do you feel entitled to have the final say on who meets your child? Do you not trust him to make those decisions?", "You have 2 kids together, then he should understand this.  It blows my mind that he's making such a big deal over this.  You literally did nothing wrong.  You're taking precautions for the safety of your child.", "Any chance he's trying to start a fight? Maybe he's pissed or guilty about something and is fighting about this instead?", "There\u2019s nothing I can do if they decline but it\u2019s nice that u offered, it\u2019s absolutely in the best interest of the kids that all parents involved (rather bio or step) work together as a team in the end the kid wins the rules r kept consistent making it easier on the kid there\u2019s no fighting drama or anger which again makes it easier on the kids there really is no downside for the kid when the adults act like adults and the put them first", "Fair enough.", "Aw I love this so much\ud83d\udda4 you both sound like outstanding parents", "Oh I can most definitely be irrational at times, but when it comes to my kids I\u2019m quite responsible.

If you and Daniel don't get along then it's good he wasn't there, and Jordan needs to get over his insecurities.   If Katie and Daniel remain together you and her being close or even just friends/friendly will make co-parenting sooooo much easier!(I know your post says full custody but day trips or if your daughter ends up wanting to spend more time with them as she ages) \n\nJordan needs to act like an adult and talk about this calmly and tell you exactly why this bothers him, and be willingly to listen as to why it's not a bad thing for your daughters sake", "NTA it was not weird. It was mature and adult of you both to meet on neutral ground, introduce your daughter to her, and help your daughter have a good relationship with her.
