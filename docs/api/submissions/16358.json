I had to move to another country lately for a semester (exchange program) so we\u2019re currently long distance.\n\nThe issue is, he has been struggling with this sudden change and feeling really down lately. This made him really insecure and thinking I would cheat on him.\n\nI saw no problem in reassuring him at first. I tried my best, even flew back home every two weeks to make him feel better (which cost me a lot of time and money and I\u2019m still a uni student). But it\u2019s getting really annoying, and it\u2019s hurting me to be honest.\n\nThis morning, after sending him a nice text telling him I love him and wishing him a great day, he told me he had a nightmare. I called him, and his nightmare was me cheating, again. I think it was the last straw for me and I lost it, told him it was both childish and annoying and that if he doesn\u2019t trust me he can just leave because I can\u2019t deal with this anymore.\n\nHe was really hurt and started guilt-tripping me telling me I should have reassured him instead. The thing is, I really love this guy. But this lack of trust and constant need of reassurance and attention is becoming really toxic.\n\nSo, AITA for yelling at him instead of reassuring him ?\n\nPS : English is not my first language, be indulgent please.", "created_utc": 1683189798, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/137elrq/aita_for_yelling_at_my_boyfriend_after_a_dream_he/", "score": 16, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Also, what on earth did he hope to achieve by *telling* you that dream? I can totally see why you cracked.\n\n\nNTA\n\n\n\nLong distance is hard, not everyone can do it, no shame in that. It's not working so break up. (Don't give up the exchange programme for this !!!)", "NTA this is a red flag. Probably best for you to be single and focus on your studies.", "NTA - I know this is very typically redditor of me, but cheaters often project their lack of fidelity onto their partners in order alleviate some of the guilt they feel about it by making the victim a bad guy as well, at least in their eyes.  Watch out for the signs.", "NTA and this is the beginning of a very controlling relationship. It\u2019s a freaking dream. His dream, and one I\u2019m skeptical he\u2019s even having.", "NTA. Maybe not the best communication for either of you, but I think a lot of people would react the way you did (and we don\u2019t know how much you\u2019ve communicated this in the past). His insecurities are his responsibility to manage, not yours. It\u2019s coming from a place of deep insecurity in himself, or he\u2019s projecting his own unfaithfulness onto you. \n\nMy ex was like this due to trauma that he wasn\u2019t ready to seek professional help for but it wore me down and eventually I got to a place where I knew I deserved to be trusted and believed when I told him I loved him so I ended it. I don\u2019t regret the time I had with him and don\u2019t wish him any ill will, but I am glad it ended.", "NTA, you're inconveniencing yourself in a few ways to try to reassure him and it doesn't seem like enough. You've done more than your fair share of effort to show that you care. You took responsibility for your role in his life but OP his insecurities and anxieties surrounding this long distance relationship are HIS responsibility to address and work through. He definitely needs to talk to a therapist. \n\nCould you have provided reassurance ? Of course but you have been exceptionally accommodating and sensitive to his needs. It seems very one sided with you putting in most of the work. I know if it were me and i got that reaction from him i would probably be upset and feel unappreciated. Especially if i was sacrificing and doing everything you are doing to be met with that. It's not a good feeling! \n\nI know it's a touchy subject but i highly recommend he see someone. He may have an anxiety or ptsd diagnosis and therapy can be really helpful for that. Left untreated it'll only get worse and the next thing could end up being he makes you choose him or school. It can then into a very controlling and manipulative situation so beware, love. \n\nAnyways NTA. Focus on your studies and finances and building a good life for yourself. Hopefully he can get some assistance and catch up to you.", "NTA you\u2019re still both so young, you don\u2019t need this needy crap in your life. Enjoy your time abroad and tell him you need a break. Who knows, the true love of your life could be just round the corner!", "NTA and bin him. He is being a child and quite honestly its not your job to constantly reassure him. Think really hard if this is the person you want to spend the rest of life with if he is this insecure.", "INFO:\n\nWhat does he mean he dreamed that you cheated on him AGAIN? Did he dream that before or did you cheat on him", "I am also in a long distance relationship and if it was like this I wouldn\u2019t be in it. \n\nNTA\n\nBe kind to yourself.", "NTA. I wouldn't be surprised if he ends up being the one who cheats as \"revenge\" of your \"cheating\". You deserve better, and if he can't deal with his jealousy issues, you might as well do yourself a favour.", "As someone who has been like your bf because of ptsd and abusive relationships in the past (also in an LDR at the time).

Just think how much more energy and time and money you'd have if you didn't have to reassure him all the time...", "NAH\nHe defiantly has lots of anxiety around you leaving. It could be something in his past or just insecurities but it's not your job to reassure him of a DREAM", "YTA for yelling at him for his subconscious.  However you should still leave.  If he dosnt have faith in you, he isn't worth the headache.", "I dont entirely agree woth the n   t   a here, but i think he ahould talk to a professional if he has deeoer traumas about something.    \n\nBut its difficult to judge what it should be \ud83e\udd14\n\nI will slap your wrist so to speak for shouting at him when he was distraught.", "NTA.
