It seems very one sided with you putting in most of the work. I know if it were me and i got that reaction from him i would probably be upset and feel unappreciated.

It hurts the both of you. He\u2019s allowed to feel insecure, but he\u2019s grown and needs to find a healthy way of dealing with it, instead of assuming you\u2019re an asshole who will cheat with the first guy she sees. That\u2019s not fair to you. Will he be this way if you go away for a week? A weekend? Will you always have to reassure him you\u2019re not cheating? \n\nMy husband had a dream he cheated on me with a celebrity, we laughed, and I said if he ever gets the chance, move me into the mansion as a maid cuz\u2019 I\u2019m tired of working. \n\nLDR are hard, and it can take some adjusting.

But no, he sounds immature. \n\nI\u2019m a guy, and I\u2019m speaking from my experiences from being a boyfriend and talking to my male friends, but what your going through is a common boyfriend experience (girlfriend dreams something and gets mad at boyfriend). Usually, it\u2019s not a big deal, but your situation seems exasperated by the long distance. The good news is that he seems like  he really loves you too. The bad news is that he\u2019s too emotional reliant on you.

I sometimes roll my eyes when this comes up but if he\u2019s like this when she visits on a biweekly basis and I presume texts and/or calls on a daily basis, there has to be some level of projection on his part. \n\nOr maybe he\u2019s trying to smoke her out of the relationship, doesn\u2019t want to be the bad guy so he decides to make the relationship unbearable so she leaves on her own.
