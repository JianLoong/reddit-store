You bought her a new ass PHONE and people are complaining that \u201cyou should know what color your spouse would like\u201d OR ?? SHE CAN SAY THANK YOU AND BUY A PHONE CASE?? \n\nY\u2019all are so spoiled and ungrateful I feel genuinely sorry for your loved ones in your lives. NTA", "NTA \n\nI had this happen once. My kids dad bought me a new iPhone in pink. I literally hate pink and I\u2019ve said this forever and somehow it still seems because I\u2019m a girl it must be my favorite color. Well what did I do? I said thank you and that I appreciate it and then promptly bought myself a phone case and poof color changed and no big deal. \n\nYou have an ungrateful wife and these are the consequences of her own actions.", "NTA. Dude tried to do something for his wife who  instead of being grateful like a normal person complained about something that easily be remedied by a case. As a result he gave it to someone who would appreciate it, actions have consequences and maybe she\u2019ll learn from this one. \nI know you said this is out of character but that\u2019s the excuse anyone uses to justify poor behavior (rightly so or not). \n\nAlso it took her days to apologize and then got mad at you when it was gone to your sister?", "NTA. Your wife's behavior was deplorable, and when she **finally** realized it, she was met with a real-life consequence that she didn't like. Her excuse for her behavior was flimsy at best, because it's super shitty to take out your work problems on your SO, everyone knows that. It's displacing your anger, ie getting angry at a substitute rather than who you're actually angry at.", "NTA\n\nActions meet consequences. If she didn't like the color, she could have put a case on it instead of complaining.", "Why didn't she just put a different colored phone case on it", "NTA. She can have a bad day without throwing a toddler tantrum. This is seriously \"but I wanted the orangeeeee cuppppp,\" energy.\n\nAlso, who the fuck doesn't use a phone case. You can make your phone literally any color, texture, size, shape you want.", "NTA. What the hell is up with all of this \"you should know her favourite colour\"? She's an adult. She's acting like a spoiled teenager.", "NTA.\n\nI\u2019d\u2019ve been thrilled to receive a new phone, but would have mentioned disliking the colour and then take advantage of the situation by teasing that now I had an excuse to spend more money on a nice case.", "NTA. Don't people just use phone cases? Who cares about the color of the phone just switch it up the cases e personalizes ad infinitum. Wife just didn't want to be happy, well she have a reason now.", "So NTA, but like, couldn\u2019t it be exchanged for a different color? I would\u2019ve asked like a rational person instead of complaining", "NTA those are the consequences of her actions", "DAYS to apologise? NTA.", "NTA, but is this one of those \u201cit\u2019s not about the yogurt\u201d situations?", "NTA. I feel like you gave it away bc you had an unused phone. If you\u2019d done it to be malicious that would be a different story, but you had no way of knowing she\u2019d want it in a few days.", "NTA. She could have just said thank you and bought a phone case in the color she likes. Also, it seems like it took her several days to apologize. I hope your sister enjoys her new phone.", "NTA", "NTA.\n\nYou did a very generous thing. My husband bought me a new phone and I couldn\u2019t care less if it had been the colour of puke, I\u2019d of been grateful. Even if your wife was having a bad day, she should realize that sometimes there are consequences to acting like an entitled and spoiled child. I hope your sister enjoys her new phone.", "NTA.", "NTA. From this one story alone your wife sounds unbearable. Who tf gets mad about a color? Get a fucking phone case you like and be grateful for having a thoughtful partner. Ugh. I don't know why people want to be in relationships. Good luck, OP.", "NTA", "NTA, she knows phone cases are a thing, right? I\u2019m pressed to remember what colour my actual phone is, I just see the case.", "NTA if someone says they don't want something I would take it to mean they didn't want it. Maybe instead of getting stroppy and saying things she didn't mean she should have used her big girl words and said thank you & she's having a bad day so can she rant please.\n\nA grownass woman should have more emotional control than this.", "NTA. It could have been exchanged for another color. Easy peasy.", "This has been posted before. In this sub.", "Info: shared or separate finances?", "Dude.\n\nI\u2019ve done some brain dead things in my marriage. This ranks up there with the best of mine!\n\nYou spent over a grand, caught her on a bad day about the color, and instead of going and getting the right color, you essentially said screw her and gave a grand+ away. Ooooof on so many layers there!\n\nYTA", "NTA at all. Imo phone color doesn\u2019t matter at all since you can just slap a case on it. My phone happens to be my favorite color but that\u2019s because it was the cheapest option available at that time and I lucked out. Ended up just putting a semi clear case in the same color on it anyway.", "As someone who's phone generally lives in a case and I hardly ever see the color of my phone. Do I care what color a phone is? Nope. I'd be happy if someone bought me a brand new phone\n\nNTA\n\nYour wife didn't want the phone, you found a new home for it. Too bad for your wife.", "Guess she learned actions have consequences. She was ungrateful and entitled. Hopefully she recognizes this and learns from it. Nta", "ESH. Wife should  have graciously accepted the generous gift, and if she didn't like the color, maybe kindly asked later if she could exchange it for the color she wants. I personally don't think asking to exchange a gift for something almost identical is rude, and as a gift-giver would be happy to see the recipient get exactly what they wanted and would appreciate even more.\n\nI'm very particular about colors and styles of things, and I make it clear to partners that for certain things I'd prefer to be asked I advance or buy those things myself.   If someone is going to spend money on me, I'd rather they spend it on something I'll really love and use often!\n\nHowever, wife's reaction to the gift was terrible. \"This isn't the one I wanted\" is miles different than \"Thank you so much! Would you mind if I exchanged this for something I'd love even more?\"\n\nOP, however, gave a gift and then took it back without asking. The phone was no longer theirs to give away. Wife not being grateful enough would have been ample reason to not give her another such gift, but does not give OP the right to take it back and give it to someone else.", "> I bought the latest version of the type she liked.\n\nDoesn't sound like you bought her the version she liked though.", "YTA\n\nYou knew she was acting out of character, it makes zero sense why you would just rashly give it to your sister.", "ES\n\nYour wife was rude. Maybe that was the only color available, did she ask? And phone cases cover almost all of  the phone anyway.  And she took a few days to apologize. Consequences.\n\nYou over reacted a bit and gave the phone away quickly, but I guess your feelings were hurt. Mine would be. Your wife sounds exhausting.\n\nChanging vote to NTA. At least your sister is happy.", "Yeah, I assume you've known your wife long enough to know when she's acting out of character and stressed. Yes, she's also the A for taking it out on you but her apology is genuine. You could have returned the phone either for refund or exchange to the right colour. Instead you chose punishment. Yta", "YTA. \n\nWhen buying someone a gift that is for daily use, get their opinion of what they want first. \n\nAlso that you\u2019re married and you still have no idea what color phone your wife would want, or that being upset about it is a sign of something you should communicate more? \n\nAnd instead of saying oh let\u2019s go back to the phone store and exchange it for a color she would like, you just scolded her for being upset??", "ESH. Not your sister though, she\u2019s an innocent bystander. Your wife was definitely ungrateful. And you should\u2019ve known what color she wanted, probably the reason why she was pissed though. Because really, you should\u2019ve known. What you should\u2019ve done to save time and the arguments was to just go exchange it for the right color and end it there. Let your sister keep the phone, but buy your wife the phone she wants in the right color, and BOTH of you apologize for not communicating correctly.", "YTA", "YTA", "You can't take the phone back.", "YTA", "YTA \n\nfor giving away the phone. \n\nYou could have just told her that it was the only color they had available at the time, so you got that one and you didn't get a case for it because she should be the one to pick the case since she will be using the phone.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
