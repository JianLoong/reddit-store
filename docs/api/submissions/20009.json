Your wife's behavior was deplorable, and when she **finally** realized it, she was met with a real-life consequence that she didn't like.

If someone is going to spend money on me, I'd rather they spend it on something I'll really love and use often!\n\nHowever, wife's reaction to the gift was terrible. \"This isn't the one I wanted\" is miles different than \"Thank you so much! Would you mind if I exchanged this for something I'd love even more?\"\n\nOP, however, gave a gift and then took it back without asking. The phone was no longer theirs to give away.
