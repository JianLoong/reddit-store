I was just deflecting her questions until she grabbed the tree. When she did that, I got up and took it from her and said that she needed to back down and leave my decorations alone.

It\u2019s not about the tree. It\u2019s that she feels entitled to tell you what to do and gets upset when you resist her.", "NTA. You were being considerate of someone else\u2019s feelings, and your mom had no business throwing a fit. \n\nYour home, your stuff, your rules. \n\nIf your mom truly wants to repair the hole in your relationship, she needs to put down the shovel and pick up a ladder.", "NTA, if she truly was trying to repair your relationship why is she trying to manipulate and abuse you? She needs to realize you have boundaries and if she wants to fix the relationship she can't try and control you.", "NTA\n\nAnd your mom has given you a valuable piece of information. She's not making amends, she's being the same toxic person she's always been.\n\nIf I were you, I would wish her well, tell her that she obviously still had some things to learn about the right way to make amends, and that you're not interested in trying to build a relationship with her at this time.\n\nYou don't owe her anything, and I'm willing to bet the mental health will improve over time once she's gone.", "NTA, there is no reason for you to feel bad.  Christmas is a secular holiday to millions, it\u2019s not only a religious one.", "NTA. That little tree may not have any religious or cultural importance to you but it\u2019s got a hellava lot of significance that it was a *gift* from a friend who doesn\u2019t judge you, disrespect you or dictate what decorative objects you\u2019re allowed have in your own bedroom. Unlike your mother.", "NTA. You didn't kick her out over a tree. You kicked her out because she found something she didn't like but was not hurting her that you displayed intentionally for the joy of it and she attempted to destroy it. She didn't care that she had no right to touch it, she was going to attempt to control you. Your family doesn't get to control your relationship with your mom and you don't have to tolerate her stomping over your boundaries and your autonomy.", "NTA. Your mom doesn't get to come into YOUR house, tell you what you are or are not allowed to own, and then try to throw away YOUR possessions. Your mom was completely out of line, and so was your uncle. Stay strong!", "NTA\n\n\"(Family member), what exactly is disrespectful about telling someone that they do not have the right to pick up and attempt to throw out, or otherwise destroy my belongings in my bedroom of all places?   Because that's what mother tried to do.  When she refused to stop, I asked her to leave.\n\n(and if you want to drive the point home)\n\nIf you really think that's acceptable behavior from 'family' by all means let me know when I can come over and tear through your property destroying whatever of yours that I don't like.  According to you that's what family does right?\"", "NTA - first let me say good for you standing up for yourself. Secondly an object does not have to have religious or cultural significance for it to be sentimental to you. And finally\u2026you did NOT throw your mother out over a tree. You kicked her out because she was trying to exert her will over your decisions & tell you how to live your life. The tree was just a prop & not what any of that was actually about.", "NTA. \nThis isn't Just about a simple Christmas tree. It's about she picking that item and instantly using it against you as ammunition (since when do Christmas trees harm people's mental health ???) and not respecting your home and boubdaries. \nShe did not respect you. And her flying monkeys can go somewhere else.", "NTA.  Doesn't sound like your mom actually wants to repair your relationship, it sounds like she just misses her punching bag.  In fact it sounds like your whole family misses their punching bag.  Go back to LC and enjoy your life.", "NTa-  and just to drive my point home- no backstory needed about your mom\u2019s past behavior. She could\u2019ve been the perfect mom and you still were right to kick her out.", "NTA\n\nDo not apologize. Part of making amends is respecting boundaries and personal space. She isn't doing that. \n\nOP, you need to hold your ground, and you need to let your mom know that her behavior flies in the face of her claims to want to repair the relationship. Your home, your rules. She doesn't get a say, and she needs to be utterly clear on that point.", "NTA. The Christmas tree is irrelevant. She came into your home and tried to make a decision to dispose of your personal property. It was beyond rude. Do not apologize.", "NTA. How you decorate your space is none of her business, she waaaay overstepped, and I can totally see where the desire to go LC comes from. Time to go back to LC.", "NTA. It was a harmless gift from a well meaning friend, not an insult to your culture or beliefs. Your mom only saw what she wanted to see, which was to find something to blame for what was happening. This is the behavior of someone who is used to deflecting responsibility for things they've done, and isn't healthy. It also shows she's still exhibiting toxic behaviors. You were right to put distance between you and her.", "NTA, it's not a tree or a cultural/religious symbol, it's a gift that has some significance for you, period.\n\nIf your mother wants to make amends, she needs to learn to respect your boundaries first.\n\nShe made your mental health worse by action (not taking them seriously in the first place) and inaction (not stopping your stepdad from bullying you), so she has no saying in what is good or bad for your health.\n\nAlso, you have the freedom to decide start celebrating chrismas any day, or change your beliefs, or whatever you want to do with your life, it's your roof now, not hers, so it's your rules now, not hers.\n\nTalk with her, set your boundaries and see if she really wants to make amends or is just looking for a way to gain back control of your life.", "NTA\n\nYou might want to go LC/NC with that fam again! THEY'RE not good for your mental health", "NTA. You are an adult, and deserve basic respect from everyone, including your parents. Basic respect includes, among other things, respecting your belongings. \n\nShe could give her opinion that she believes you celebrating christmas, or having christmas decorations is not helping your mental condition. Then you can decide to do with that information what you want. Not sure about the other relatives that called you, they surely didn't get the same story posted here, so can't really tell if they're assholes. If they also listened to your side, and then decided you're wrong, they also fail the top line, and are assholes too. If they didn't even listen to you, well, then they are TA as well.", "NTA, she had no right to come on your property and throw a fit about a tree that you accepted from your roomate, not to celebrate Christmas but to make the best of a gift and decorate it to match your room. She was being controlling and showed you no respect. She might be one of the main reasons you struggle with mental issues. Be strong and stand your ground so you can have a toxic free life. Hugs and I hope you do well.", "NTA.  Unless your mom is funding your apartment, she has no say (and then very little!!).  If nothing else (religious a/o cultural issues aside), just maybe that glittery decorated GIFTED tree makes you smile and makes you happy.  {{ME:  I'd be petty and tell them I have switched religions and now celebrate Christmas and the meaning behind it, but then again, that is ME}}.  \n\nOP, you do YOU.  You do whatever lifts your spirits and makes you happy and at peace.  Your manners in accepting this gift from your room mate are priceless; he forgot you did not celebrate, you kindly accepted and thanked him.\n\nIf you look at this tree as a gift and as something that makes you happy, that is all that is required.  Reading about your mom's response and anger, plus her running to go tattle to the uncle, I can somehow see WHY you may get mental a/o emotional issues at times.\n\nI hope you get to feeling better.  Stay LC or NC.  Be with those who treat you well.  Continue to feel better.  And I'm sure your little pink tree is just cute as can be.  Take care of YOU.", "NTA. Your mother has made it perfectly clear that she doesn't respect you or your feelings. I'd be back to LC.", "NTA. She is making no effort. She is trampling over your boundaries again and reaching for control. Go LC again.", "NTA absolutely don\u2019t apologize you did nothing wrong", "NTA. You had a cute pink sparkly tree decorating your room, and it's none of your mom's business why. Your mom may say she wants to make amends, but it sounds like she just wants to keep bullying you.", "NTA    I moved cities to stop my mother from doing things like this.\n\nThe fact that it was a Christmas tree makes absolutely no difference, she was trying to steamroll your choice, and manipulate your environment. \n\nDon't feel bad about standing up for yourself, and consider going back to LC. If she wants more contact she has to prove she's worth it.", "She caused the issue, she owes you an apology \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f Your brother and uncle can go fuck themselves", "NTA, your mom is a piece of work. With all the kindness I can muster, screw that lady, she is not trying to help you. She seems to be trying to mend her bruised ego more than your relationship based on her actions.", "NTA - your mom hasn\u2019t changed one bit , she\u2019s still just as controlling as ever . Don\u2019t worry about the opinions of your family about the matter , they\u2019re not you and I\u2019m guessing she\u2019s manipulating them\nAs well -", "Will is right.  She had no right touching your tree.\n\nIf she knew you had recent suffered a mental health crisis, and she cared about you, why on earth would she try to take something from you against your wishes.\n\nUncle and brother can go kick rocks.  Mom doesn't get to come to your apartment for a while.  You understand that, right?  She crossed your boundaries and immediately went into controlling mode when she saw the tree.  You meet at neutral ground like restaurants or parks.", "NTA. You did not disrespect her - she disrespected you.", "NTA.
