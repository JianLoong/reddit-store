I would be making you pay for them", "YTA- You're coming from a good place kid, I would've done the same. But, at the end of the day, they're adults and they can decide what they spend their money on. \n\nBoth my parents had smoked for decades and finally stopped after realizing how much time and money they're dedicating to it. \n\nTalk to your parents, tell them your concerns, and ask if they're willing to put in the effort so they can be around for you as long as possible.", "This isn't going to solve anything. They're just going to buy more because the root cause isn't being addressed.", "Yes, unfortunately,  YTA.\n\nThey are adults and are legally allowed to smoke. Especially you don't have the right to damage or throw away what they've paid for.\n\nI agree that it is a terrible and disgusting habit.", "YTA. I get the sentiment, but you throwing away their cigarettes is not going to do anything to convince them to quit. If it was that simple they most likely would have quit years ago.", "yta. you know that won't make them quit smoking right? it just makes them have to go buy more, which they will. You're essentially just throwing their money away, which is rude.  stop it. if they want to smoke that is their decision. you can grow up and be better and not smoke yourself. but this behavior is futile and disrespectful.", "Let's change it around and put the shoe on the other foot.\n\nOn a weekly basis, you buy a prepaid card for a video game system, Fortnite bucks or whatever. Parents find it, say you're killing yourself spending so much time playing video games (whether you play video games or not) and they cut it up with a pair of scissors so it's basically unusable and toss it.\n\nWould they be TA?\n\nYou may be TA here. Cigarettes aren't cheap, and they're very VERY hard to quit.\n\nIf you want to help them, then start with conversations expressing concern. Move onto threats even, but I don't feel like you have the right to basically burn their money.\n\n-Edited to add the following -\nMy parents smoked for the first 20 years of my life. They only quit once they decided to, and put their minds to it.", "YTA.\n\nI used to do the same when I was little, so I get where you're coming from.

I\u2019m sorry, bud. \n\nI used to do that to my mom when I was your age cause I thought it would help her quit. Long story short, that will never help a smoker quit.  I understand your frustration but destroying the cigs your parents bought won\u2019t make them quit. All it does if forces them to go out buy more, and therefore spend more money than they already are. It\u2019s an expensive habit. There are other more effective ways to help them quit. Talk to them about it. Recommend books or nicotine patches etc.. at the end of they day they are adults that can make there own choices.  all you can do is encourage them to quit smoking and destroying their cigarettes won\u2019t help.", "YTA for not respecting their choices. Smoking is bad, sure, but talk with them. They won't quit because you threw away their cigarettes, it'll only cost them more.", "YTA. I get why you're doing it but throwing out their cigarettes isn't going to stop them. And technically their property. You'll only anger them and they can easily replace them or start hiding them. Have you tried having a serious deep conversation about this with them? Or tried to figure out the cause behind their smoking? Quiting cold turkey could be hard for them even if this works, have you even thought of ways to convince them to slowly smoke less and eventually quit?", "YTA, you can't force someone to change to a healthier lifestyle even if it's coming from a good place. It would be very reasonable to ask them not to smoke inside the house because that's exposing you, a minor, to secondhand smoke against your wishes. You can't save them from the health effects of smoking but you can save yourself.", "YTA. Don't touch/destroy other people's stuff regardless of your reasons.  \n\nI have a relative that died from diabetes.  Would it be cool if I threw away all of your snacks?", "YTA\n\nYour parents are adults and can make their own choices, whether they are bad or not. As long as they don't smoke around you or in the house, let them be. Although, unfortunately at your age, you cannot demand they not smoke in the house, but you can ask that they smoke outside. That is if they smoke inside.", "YTA - you're costing them even more money than they have to spend. They're adults and they are entitled to make their own choices. Not one thing you do will make them quit, it's a decision they have to make for themselves, in fact what you're doing is probably making them smoke more than they would otherwise do - either because they're having to wait for their first nicotine hit of the day and will chainsmoke to satisfy the extra craving you created by trashing the cigs they had in the house, or because they're trying to finish up cigs before you trash them.", "YTA, at the end of the day, they can choose to smoke if they want.\n\nWhen you're 18, will you drink? Will you smoke weed?\n\nEasy to judge others, but really they are adults that can smoke if they want.", "YTA it's not your responsibility to dictate to your parents what they can and can not do with thier thier lives..\nJust becuase your grandfather died..while I am sorry for your loss. It didn't mean a opening as Health Dictator opened up.", "YTA, I get why your doing it, but they\u2019re adults who can choose to smoke if they want to. So stop throwing them out, not only is it destruction of their property it\u2019s also a total waste of money. Your being incredibly disrespectful to them by destroying something they spent their money on. If you were the one paying for the cigarettes it\u2019s be a different story, but you\u2019re not so cut it out.", "YTA. You don't get to make this choice.", "YTA. Quitting cigarettes is hard. I've tried many times and I haven't been able to kick the habit yet. I've asked people to hide my cigarettes and lighters from me when I tried to quit, and I just ended up buying more. A lot of people that care about me have expressed that they would like me to quit, but they've never tried to force me. Hiding or destroying cigarettes will not make a smoker quit. The only person who can decide to quit is the smoker themselves.", "YTA, look I understand where you're coming from but throwing them away isn't doing anything besides wasting more money.", "YTA", "Really soft YTA. Unfortunately they are adults and you are destroying their property. It really sucks to be in your situation", "YTA\n\nYour parents smoking does not mean they will get lung cancer or die young. My dad is in his 70s and has been smoking before he hit double digits.\n\nDoes he have health conditions? Yes.\n\nAre these health conditions caused by him smoking? No.\n\nDoes his smoking make his health condition worse? Maybe.\n\nObviously everyone is different and smoking can cause a lot of shit, but at the same time your parents are adults who are doing something legal.

I don\u2019t smoke and don\u2019t allow smoking in my home.", "I\u2019m not going to judge this. I\u2019m sorry for the loss of your grandfather. At the age of 15 (at least in USA) they are drilling into your head at school how bad smoking is because they don\u2019t want you to start smoking, which you shouldn\u2019t. It is not easy to quit smoking cigarettes and throwing them away won\u2019t make your parents want to stop it\u2019s just going to make them angry. Cigarettes also weren\u2019t always viewed the way they are today, I remember going into restaurants when I was a kid and they would ask smoking or non smoking, and I\u2019m not even 30! I guess what I\u2019m saying is cut your parents some slack. They grew up in a different generation.", "NTA but it's futile. Nicotine is one of the most addictive substances around, and they aren't going to quit over what you're doing. They know how bad it is for them.

Do the leg work for it and if you need help message me, I've been doing the vape thing a while now and I could answer questions that are more not blasting your parents habits across public space.\n\nAnyways. Vaping is cheaper in a lot of ways so they would be saving money. It is 95% healthier, so there is that, and they can take it at their own pace and aren't limited to Tobacco and Menthol flavors, they won't smell like smoke, they will get their sense of smell and taste back all sorts of advantages and it is a solid middle ground compromise.

Overcoming addiction is hard, and I say this as someone with a nicotine addiction. And pizza could be addictive, because there are people who are addicted to food.

It happens rarely, but sometimes it\u2019s good to be an asshole.  Props, hope they quit soon!", "So I\u2019m gonna be biased because I smoke. Being upfront about it. \n \nYou\u2019re not gonna win someone over by destroying something of theirs. It\u2019s going to come off as more of an angsty teen/toddler tantrum behavior. You need to do this through discussion and coming from a place of concern. No yelling, accusations, or ultimatums. You\u2019re doing a sensible thing, getting rid of the addictive stuff, but going about it wrong. Smoking is an addiction. It\u2019s not easy to just quit. Trust me, I\u2019ve tried. \n \nWhat you need to look up is harm reduction. Usually focused on more serious things like hard drugs, but same principle applies here. Have a conversation about your concerns and try to encourage them to start with baby steps. They smoke a pack a day? Well can they start by cutting back to 3/4? If they can cut back to that, then push for 1/2 a pack. Don\u2019t be super pushy about it, gentle reminders and positive encouragement are key. Tell them you\u2019re proud they reduced their usage. And don\u2019t try to push too quickly. I could take months or longer to get them to cut back. \n \nSee if they\u2019d be open to alternatives like nicotine gum or patches to help with this. Or see if you can incentivize them by offering to do extra chores if they cut back. It might help them if they get cranky from nicotine withdrawal to have a clean environment. \n \nAgain, quitting smoking absolutely sucks and is not easy. But you need to be supportive instead of antagonistic. It isn\u2019t your responsibility to make them change their ways, and it\u2019s shitty that you\u2019ve been put in this situation. Ultimately you are not responsible for their choices and they can only quit if they really want to. \n \nYou might try all the above and it doesn\u2019t make a difference. At a certain point, you need to accept you can\u2019t change others. It sucks to see someone harming themselves, but there\u2019s nothing you can do to help. It\u2019s not a failure on your part, it isn\u2019t your fault. That\u2019s just life.", "I feel this. My older brother, myself, and my younger brother each tried our hand at convincing our parents to quit. It sucks, yeah? But until they're ready and willing to quit, they won't. Destroying their supply is just going to upset them, cuz dang are they not cheap. I hope they get there, but it will be in their own time.", "I know this is really difficult because I was basically you when I was a teenager trying to get my dad to quit . I\u2019ll give you some advice you probably don\u2019t want to hear: stop trying to get them to quit. It\u2019s so much emotional and mental energy you\u2019re expending doing this, and all it\u2019s going to do is cause them to continue to pour money down the drain by buying more cigarettes. For many smokers, buying cigarettes takes priority. My dad would say we couldn\u2019t afford to send me on a field trip but always had 2-300 dollars to spend on cigarettes every month.\n\nFor someone to quit smoking they need to want to quit. You can clearly articulate that you want them to be around for a long time etc, but after that it\u2019s up to them. The only other thing you can really do for yourself is draw firm boundaries e.g. refuse to be in the same room if they\u2019re smoking, take a different mode of transport if they\u2019re going to smoke in the car. \n\nI gave up around 15 years ago trying to get my dad to quit, and he still smokes and probably will til he dies. It sucks, but it\u2019s better to save yourself the grief and emotional energy in the long run.", "I do just want to point out, as someone with a nicotine addiction, that just getting rid of the cigarettes won't solve anything. Cigarettes are very expensive for one and if they go cold turkey it could be pretty bad for them. I totally understand where you are coming from, when I was younger I would constantly berate my dad when he would smoke or vape around me but ultimately it didn't do anything. He had to decide to change for himself. Your parents need to know to know where you are coming from bud. Let them know fully and completely how much it affects you. Addicts will always find a way of using a substance even if you get rid of it and all you do by intervening this way is putting them more at risk. I have dug burnt coils out of the bin because I couldn't afford new ones. Don't hold back okay? THey need to know how much you worry and how it puts you at risk and hopefully this may help them get to a place where they can quit. Ultimately, it is not your responsibility to fix them and it never ever should be. Take care of yourself.", "You can\u2019t stop them from dying. It\u2019s their decission.

Everyone dies. No one can outlast it. They could smoke into their 90s or die crossing a parking lot.  You aren't an adult and don't get to make choices for adults.

But ultimately it's their health and money and not your place to decide. Tell them you understand that now. And also money is a huge thing. All the money they could save by quitting could be spend for nice, lasting things or experiences, some people get a whole family vacation from stopping to smoke or just other nice things for them to enjoy.\nSeeing my mother and grandmother suffering from the long-term consequences definitely did put me off smoking already as a child and my grandmother getting lung cancer and being dependant from an oxygen device at her home, having panic attacks because she could not breath showed my mother that that's what will happen to her and she stopped.\nBut this behaviour just makes your parents angry.

It is very difficult to let it go,but right now your worry is only harming you.\n\nGood luck.", "We all die mate, non Smokers die every day. \n\nI actually had a friend like you, proper gym bunny always getting on at me for smoking and snorting. \n\nHe drove his motorbike head first into a combine harvester when he was 19.", "One thing that worked for my friends is to use one of the apps that tracks your spending / saving on cigarettes. They entered how much it cost and how often they buy a pack and the number starts counting up. It gets to be a considerable amount of money pretty quickly. One of them checked their total saved since quitting the other day and realized they would have spent enough to buy a car by now if they had kept smoking", "Sitting around playing games for hours and hours a day leads to health issues (due to weight gain caused by the inactivity) for those who are addicted to gaming and can't pull themselves away.\n\nThere have been kids who were neglected badly (iirc some even died) from parental neglect caused by gaming addictions.\n\n[http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/asiapcf/04/01/korea.parents.starved.baby/index.html](http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/asiapcf/04/01/korea.parents.starved.baby/index.html)  \n[https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna19766590](https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna19766590)   \n[https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1394903/Rebecca-Colleen-Christie-jailed-25-years-allowing-daughter-Brandi-Wulf-STARVE-death-played-World-Warcraft.html](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1394903/Rebecca-Colleen-Christie-jailed-25-years-allowing-daughter-Brandi-Wulf-STARVE-death-played-World-Warcraft.html)   \nSo yes, gaming addictions, like smoking addictions have led to health issues, or death for people. \n\nEdit to add links related to my comments.", "You should be sorry", "Yeah...it's like, as much as you think it's a waste of money, you're just wasting X times more by throwing them away and making them buy more to replace them. And possibly making them smoke more aggressively to try and finish them faster before they go \"missing\" or to alleviate withdrawal symptoms.", "You can't \"smoke responsibly\" lol. It's an addiction. This is a ridiculous analogy.", "I did this for about 4 years - if I found cigarettes I would crush and throw away, when mum sent me to the shop  I refused to buy them. That lasted from 7 - 11 - I'm now 37 she still smokes. This doesn't work, save yourself the hassle", "I disagree that you're TA here, I think parents who smoke around their children are TAs, but the reality is that throwing away their cigarettes isn't going to accomplish anything except for wasting money. \n\nSmoking is an addictionl they're not going to smoke less because you throw individual cigarettes away, they're just going to go through packs more quickly.", "Do you also throw away their fast food? Their coffe? Do you insist on them putting on a mask, every time they leave the house due to pollution? \nGTFO your high horse and let them be them. We all have our struggles. \nJust focus on you", "This book is gospel! Highly recommend to anyone looking to quit", "I used the audio book version. Was great!", "Justified AH", "Don't be obtuse, smoking is an incredibly dangerous and deadly addiction. Hundreds of thousands of people die from it every year. Comparing it to drinking coffee is absolutely ridiculous."]}
