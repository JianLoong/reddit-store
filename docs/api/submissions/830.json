Our moms were friends growing up and we were pretty much raised together. We have continued to stay best friends through all these years, and both attend the same college. A year ago, Josh started seeing a girl \"Lydia\" (21 F) and it eventually developed into a relationship. They have been officially dating for six months. I never met her when they were just talking because he didn't know where the relationship was going and obviously the times they were hanging out it was a no clothes party, and I didn't want to be a cock block.\n\nWhen they did start dating, he introduced us asap because I'm his best friend. At first, I thought it was just shyness because I am a close friend of his, so you obviously want to get along with your partners friend, but it became clear very quick that she just had a problem with our friendship. This past Saturday there was a Halloween party at our friend's place. Lydia was bringing a friend and told Josh that she and her friend would be doing a matching costume. So, Josh asked me if we wanted to do a costume together. We decided to go as Steve and Robin from stranger things. I guess on Friday he told her this was happening and suddenly her tune changed, and she wanted to do a couple's costume. He saw what she was doing and told her no. So, she then texted me asking if I would change my costume. I said no because I already spent my money and didn't know If I could return it plus, I'd have to scramble for another costume. All of a sudden, I started getting SPAMMED from random numbers (probably her friends) calling me all sorts of names. The whole time Saturday she was sulking and one of her friends seemed to be consoling her the whole night. It just felt awkward. Josh is telling me we didn't do anything wrong, but I feel like he's biased cause he's my friend. I want a third parties' opinion. AITA?\n\nEdit: I don\u2019t plan on telling him about the texts. None of them were malicious or scary, just mean spirited. I\u2019m gonna give her the benefit of the doubt and hope that this was a random act that was totally out of her typical character.\n\nEdit: after reading some of your comments I plan on telling Josh after class today when we meet up for lunch.\n\nEdit: I told Josh. Of course as many of you predicted, he is unsurprisingly really upset with her.", "created_utc": 1667350239, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yjqt8l/aita_for_matching_halloween_costumes_with_my/", "score": 1865, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My 2 best friends are both guys, one of whom is my ex from high school. One of my ex's GFs from when we were around the same age you are now sounds a lot like Lydia - she sent her friends to harass me, bullied me on social media, etc. But 10 years later he's still my best friend and she's a distant memory. And guess what? Both guy friends were groomsmen for my husband at our wedding bc my husband not only recognizes and values their place in my life but also found value in their friendship for himself as well.\n\nYou did nothing wrong. Let Josh manage his relationship, he sounds like a great friend.\n\nEdit: missing word", "NTA. At all. Some people on this thread don\u2019t seem to understand how friendship works. Lydia needs to grow the fuck up. If she wanted to do a couple\u2019s costume then she should have told him in advance. She seems like a jealous and insecure person", "Love that you guys picked Steve and Robin, a beautifully platonic relationship. Your bestie literally waited for his gf to make her decision about her costume then he followed her lead! She did a duet set with her bestie, he did one with his! Just because she wants to sulk doesn\u2019t make it anyones fault. She had opportunity and she shit the bed. Those are self consequences. Your friend sounds like a good dude.", "Josh is right. Lydia is insecure AF and it's gonna bite her in the ass. Josh seems like a good friend. NTA.", "NTA-steve and robin are best friends. they don\u2019t ever get together. plus you didn\u2019t suggest it, he did.", "NTA. It would have been one thing if she wanted to do a matching costume with Josh; in that case (sorry) but she as the girlfriend takes rank over you as the friend. But that wasn't the case here. Her sulking and having people spam your phone was ridiculous. \n\nNo matter what anyone says there's always a certain degree of awkwardness when you start dating someone who has a close friend of the opposite gender. But if she wants to talk about boundaries she needs to do it in a far more mature way.", "I wanted to be able to excuse her because trust can be hard and jealously is real and doesn\u2019t immediately deserve to be disregarded, it\u2019s natural. but the bullying is way over the line and I\u2019m glad your friend is showing that he won\u2019t be controlled setting an important standard, but if you don\u2019t want to turn this into a huge thing maybe try inviting them over for a low key dinner party or something and spending most the time finding common ground and forging a bond with her", "YIKES. NTA. She is jealous and the whole texting your number thing is way over the line. She done messed up in my book. Ignore this you did nothing wrong. She is insanely insecure.", "NTA she took your phone number so her friends can harass you, she sounds very insecure", "NTA.  The answer would be different if girlfriend hadn't started the friendship costume instead of couples costume.", "NTA but I had to double check everyone's ages.. JFC", "From the title I was ready to say Y T a. \n\nBetween friendships and romantic relationships, it's appropriate for the relationship to come first. \n\nI'd expect my spouse to do a couples/matching costume with me before he went to his friend - regardless of gender. \n\nBut this new gf is trying to enforce double standards and just seems generally toxic and insecure. \n\nNTA", "NTA neither you or your friend did anything wrong, his GF is the AH in this case", "NTA\n\nJosh needs to look for a better girlfriend.   That's not the behavior of a 21 year old, that's the behavior of a 12 year old.", "NTA, and she definitely is the AH for coming after you and having a huge overreaction. AND now you know that there's some insecurity there and perhaps you can be a little gentle about that in the future. Not because you *have to* but just because you can be a thoughtful and compassionate person. I'm not suggesting you change your relationship with your friend at all, but maybe think twice about going the extra step of like, couples costumes. In future. Sounds like they won't last anyway, but that's not your circus.\n\nI love this sub, but sometimes it's not about being the AH or not, it's about would it have been easy to extend a little grace when you weren't obligated to, just because it's a nice thing to do.", "Grow up crazy GF or you will become the crazy ex-GF. omg. Too much work she is.\n\nNTA.", "Not the AH but your pal\u2019s gal is; he needs to dump her.

If any, she should have talked to her bf.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTell him about the harassment.", "NTA \n\nJosh's gf is insecure which is understandable. Regardless of how many times you can reassure someone the dynamic can be too difficult to accept.  Even long term friends can develop feelings eventually", "NTA. His relationship is going to be short lived (hopefully) because she is playing games and attempting to isolate him from his friend (you) like it is a competition. It is a level of immaturity and if she doesn\u2019t grow up, he will hopefully get frustrated and break up with her.", "NTA She seems jealous of your close relationship with your friend. Your relationship sounds clearly plutonic, especially considering you went as Steve and Robin for Halloween. \nHowever, one thing I would consider is, even though you two have been friends for a long time, displaying that close relationship to a new partner could potentially invoke feelings of jealousy. It seems alarming to me that she has other people calling to harass you about it, so some personality issues may have been brought to his attention early on, so maybe it helped him dodge a bullet. I would try to take a back seat approach with your friend when either one of you get into a new relationship.", "Info: why is this getting spammed with awards? Am I out of the loop about something?", "NTA, she is jealous. If my partner got their friends to harass my best friend I would dump him. You might want to tell Josh he is dating a psycho.", "NTA.

She could have joined and dressed up as Nancy if she wanted.", "NTA She's possessive, sexist and really immature. If \"Josh\" read this: dump her ass bro.", "NTA. Josh asked you to do a group costume with him. Don't listen to his gf, her insecurity/jealousy is a bit concerning.", "NTA. If anything was going to happen between the two of you, it probably would have already.  From what you said here, it sounds like you've been respectful of their relationship and the only reason you two did a costume together was because she was doing one with someone else. She has insecurities that she needs to work out on her own without trying to come between two lifelong friends.", "ESH. \n\nI have best guy friends. I would not do this. You had to have known this would put fuel on the fire. She already doesn\u2019t like or trust your friendship with him, and you leaned on that insecurity. Josh either needs to break up with her or not intentionally make her more uncomfortable by doing a doubles costume with a girl she\u2019s insecure about. And she sucks for making this your problem.", "ESH\n\nShe should not be sending her friends to harass you. \n\nBut you and your buddy choose to dress up as two characters who [spoilers] were originally supposed to get together before the writers changed directions [/end spoilers]. I get why she was uncomfortable.", "YTA \u2026IMO only, wearing a matching costume is a very couple thing to do. Of course a new gf is going to wonder wtf is up with you all especially if the gf was matching costumes with another girl and you two are doing a boy girl thing. Bad optic\u2019s.\n\nIn real life having a m-f best friend is never going to help the primary romantic relationship. Suppose he starts confiding in you about their relationship? How is she going to understand what\u2019s an atypical but innocent friendship from you guys having an emotional affair? Christ what if he doesn\u2019t agree to plans with her to hang with you instead. Most people would see fire.\n\nIf you\u2019ve hooked up the situation is even more off kilter. If you hooked up and he\u2019s not telling her the complete story of your relationship you\u2019re in a conspiracy to lie by omission.\n\nLook, is she being petty and insecure? Yes. Is it exactly the kind of situation most romantic partners would find off putting? Also yes.", "I\u2019m gonna say NTA kind of lightly. I think when she was doing a matching costume with her friend, she didn\u2019t expect him to do one with his girl best friend. So as for her being uncomfortable, man after seeing the horror stories on here and tiktok, I can\u2019t say I blame her for being weary. I agree with you that your relationship sounds strictly platonic, but since it\u2019s a relatively new relationship, sounds like she\u2019s insecure. With that being said, there\u2019s no excuse for her sending her friends to harass you, that\u2019s just wrong(although i am wondering if she told them to do this or if they did it because their friend was hurt). If they do stay together, I would just keep my distance, but not talk badly about her. But yeah, you\u2019re in the clear, my explaining why she might be feeling this way was just an explanation, in no way is it excusing her actions.\n\nEdit to add: I\u2019m also uncomfortable with super close female friends, mostly the ones who know no boundaries and are too touchy feely. My point is, I know I would be uncomfortable so I avoid it, but if she knew she would be, she shouldn\u2019t have agreed to be in a relationship with Josh.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

What it really means is: they're likely surrounded by a ton of queer folks.\n\nAnd do you know what happens when you actually know a plurality of queer folks? You start to realize that a lot of heteronormative hot takes like yours are pretty silly. Plenty of folks with attraction to more than their direct opposite gender manage to be friends with people just fine.. By your logic, my being bisexual means I can't ever have a close friendship where I'd do something like coordinate a costume.\n\nBut you do agree that's silly, yes? Certainly I am capable of having close friendships, even if nominally all of those folks are...technically fuckable?\n\n>I\u2019m a nurse, I\u2019ve had plenty of female friends. Some of them close because of shared trauma. I don\u2019t take time away from my wife to go hang and have drinks with them and they wouldn\u2019t do the same to their SO\u2019s.\n\nWhy? Spending quality time with friends, away from your SO, is super healthy and normal, if for no other reason than that it *gives you space to talk about your relationship* and work through your feelings with a friend. If you're always with your spouse, you can't ever do that...and this is just scratching the surface of why the lack of that sort of space is a problem.\n\n>Insecurity isn\u2019t automatically a bad thing, sometimes it\u2019s the first clue to a coming problem. It is a kindness to people you love to be above suspicion.\n\nSo rather than address the root cause of the insecurity, you'd rather just paper over it? I suppose if I get into a car accident, I should demand my spouse walk with me everywhere, rather than work on myself and overcome my irrational fear to be in a car?\n\n>Your approach and POV seems functionally unworkable to me.\n\nClearly. That said, I don't think you're setting yourself up for long term relationship success by hiding from your problems and sticking your fingers in your ears.\n\n>I hope I came across as civil as we\u2019re unlikely to be swayed by each other\u2019s arguments I suspect.\n\nYou seem to believe yourself to be a logical person, but honestly it seems like you lack diverse perspectives and lived experiences. As someone who has lived in both queer progressive bubbles, as well as super heteronormative conservative areas, I can tell you that a past version of myself solely immersed in the latter would have made similarly flimsy arguments once upon a time. There's a lot of personal growth you seem to be closing yourself off from,", "\"It\u2019s up there with brother and sister characters for sure.\" -Shaysdays\n\nTo be fair, I've seen Lannister Twin costumes. It was a married couple but still, more than I wanted to know about their kinks.", "Him and Hopper are my fave. I think I love Steve cause that boy just keeps getting his ass kicked, but he never gives up. I mean, so does Hopper, but hes a grown ass man. Steve is still a baby. I like Hopper cause hes schmexy. (I feel like I've definitely confirmed I am over 30 with this comment lmaooo)", "Can confirm, Steve is still awesome. Him and Robin and Dusty pretty much make S4.\n\nI honestly laughed when OP mentioned Steve + Robin were their costumes. Absolutely perfect!", "He seems to be a fan favorite, and I\u2019m worried that means they may kill him off before it\u2019s all said and done. \ud83d\ude1e", "I watched the show, lol. He told her he liked her because he was looking for a replacement for Nancy. The fact that he dropped so quickly and easily into a platonic friendship when he was rejected by her only proves my point", "LMAO, trying to turn the first girl you meet into a girlfriend because you\u2019re still hung up on your ex and don\u2019t want to be alone sounds like a crush to you?  Wow.", "Yes, I know it does. It just was neither apparently nor statistically likely what we were dealing with with the original post.", "Nobody assumes everyone is straight. OP just wasn't describing a gay relationship.", "If you go right now, on Reddit, to the relationship section, and scroll down, you\u2019ll absolutely find posts starting out \u201cwife cheated with her best friend from work\u201d or \u201cgirlfriend hooked up with a guy from her past.\u201d Go back long enough and you\u2019ll be inundated.\n\nIt is sad when theory does match practice. All I\u2019m saying is Josh, if he likes having romantic relationships with women, is going to need to figure out how to deal with this. Because it\u2019s going to come up a lot in his life.\n\nPeople can be insecure (cause humans are) or they can be provoked into it by other peoples\u2019 behavior. Same with jealousy. \n\nBy which I don\u2019t mean the OP did anything intentionally, only that dismissing ever situation where a woman is uncomfortable with a SO\u2019s different gender bestie is wrong. It\u2019s a form of gaslighting in those situations where the relationship is unhealthy.\n\nEvery woman who gets peeved when their guy\u2019s girl friend shows up in a costume meant for couples isn\u2019t always going to be some psycho with tremendous low self esteem\u2014they can just find the *situation* potentially problematic.", "I\u2019m over 30. Shhhh. I love Hopper, too :)\n\nI kept wanting to skip through parts with Nancy and whatshisname for season 2 and 3.", "My 10 year old was Robin this year, she did not have a Steve, but she rocked it solo. It's a really cute costume!", "Yeah when I read that I was like\u2026well that\u2019s totally appropriate and no misunderstanding should happen there!", "Oh noooooooo \ud83d\ude48\ud83d\ude49", "Wow, this comment feels rather overblown and extreme. \n\nAnd, yes, people get crushes for all sorts of reasons. That's why they're crushes - not usually super well thought out and reasoned.", "Good point. Statistical likelihood indicates your post is wrong because you state that the statistical likelihood of bisexuality equals 0 by formulating an absolute. \n\nStatistical likelihood is a reason to include more stuff to cover all your bases, not a reason to exclude more stuff because chances are I'm right anyway. The longer you do the latter, the higher the statistical likelihood that you get something completely wrong because it was actually about a bisexual person that passes as monosexual.", "People only post on the relationship sub when they have problems with their relationship, you can't draw conclusions about the frequency of issues based on what you see there. Same with this sub, if you went by what you see here you'd assume getting engaged was a surefire way to end a relationship. \n\nIf someone has a problem with platonic opposite-sex friendships when nothing untoward is happening, that's *their* problem for *them* to solve by working on their own insecurity. I understand that many people refuse to do so, and that many partners of those people choose to artificially limit their social circle rather than force the issue. I just think it's sad.", "Yes, of course, people only post there when something is wrong. It\u2019s the fact that the problem is ubiquitous enough to continuously be posted about that proves the point.\n\nIf this wasn\u2019t common then this wouldn\u2019t be a problem people post about so much\u2026\n\nLet me ask you this (I\u2019m asking out of genuine curiosity), don\u2019t you feel like Josh needs to address this? Sad or not, this kind of situation is uncomfortable for a lot of people.\n\nOf course it\u2019s their feelings to work on, but automatically branding them as insecure and dismissing it out of hand seems totally simplistic for something as complex as a three way relationship.\n\nFiguring out how to integrate girl friend\u2019s suspicions of OP\u2019s presence so they can all get along seems to be a kinder way to handle two people he cares about, rather than just saying \u201cit\u2019s your problem. You go figure it out\u201d\n\nAgain, I\u2019m trying for information, not trying to tit for tat your points. It\u2019s extremely unlikely either one of us is going to wow the other with our view point to cause us to change our mind, so I\u2019m just being curious.\n\nAlso. I\u2019m sorry you feel sad. I, too, have felt sad before. I found it unpleasant, as I\u2019m sure you do to. I hope you feel better soon.", "In this particular case I think Josh needs to end the relationship with Lydia. The two of them had a conflict, she was unsatisfied with the result, and rather than pursue it with him further or break up with him, she bullied and harassed his friend. That's despicable, even if she had been in the right in their conflict.\n\nPrior to that, Josh should have addressed it by reassuring Lydia there was nothing going on with OP, avoiding complimenting OP's appearance in her presence, avoiding solo late-night hangouts, etc. There is room to be sensitive to your partner's insecurities without letting them control your life."]}
