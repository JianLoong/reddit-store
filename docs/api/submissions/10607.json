I just recently moved to a one bedroom apartment near a dense neighbourhood. I have to walk past several blocks of houses in order to reach my apartment building from the train station. A man probably in his 60s, really loves to sit in front of his porch and we can always see each other every time I walk home. Me and my boyfriend always say hi every time we walk past and he would ask us to have a little chat with him. It feels normal when I talk to him with my boyfriend around, but I walk past his house mostly alone after work, because my boyfriend works from home. The first time I talked to him alone, he always addressed me as \u2018beautiful girl\u2019 or \u2018gorgeous girl\u2019 while also looking at me up and down. That word slipped in between sentences 6-7 times, for example \u2018It\u2019s nice to see a beautiful girl like you in this neighbourhood\u2019. At the end of conversation he asked if I would like to join him for dinner sometime. The next time i said hi and stayed for a minute chat, I told him I was eating soup for dinner, he said \u2018it\u2019s sad that a beautiful girl only eat soup for dinner\u2019. then he said i was going to eat chicken the next day. I asked him how would he know, he said \u2018the chicken told me\u2019. I was just confused and didn\u2019t think much of it.\nFor a week or more i took a detour so I would not see him, because I was getting bad vibes talking to him alone. Recently I was very tired from work and just walk past his house to cut my walk short. This time he asked why I didn\u2019t come after he said he would give me chicken. Turns out the chicken conversation means he would give me dinner because he doesn\u2019t want me to eat soup. But since I took a detour he couldn\u2019t give it to me. He kept the chicken for 2 days then gave it to a friend. He said next time he promised me something, I should come and get it, because he is serious. Even if I work until late, I can just knock on his door. I just said yes and quickly walk home. In this conversation he also addressed me as beautiful girl as usual.\n\nIs this creepy behaviour or am I just overreacting? WIBTA if i just ignore him and not say hi anymore because I\u2019m uncomfortable?", "created_utc": 1677057286, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/118tmbt/wibta_if_i_ignore_my_neighbour/", "score": 210, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This is creepy behavior in my opinion and I would avoid him whenever possible. It may be that you have to find a way to politely tell him you feel uncomfortable when he extends invitations that don\u2019t include your bf. If he wants to invite you and your bf for dinner, perhaps you could consider that if you wish. But I think letting him know you have no interest in any alone time with him in a straightforward manner is the only way this guy will stop. These type guys push and push until you shut it down. Then he will find the next \u201cbeautiful girl\u201d to make chicken for.", "NTA creeper looking for a reason for you to come in his yard, house, ew. Stay clear. Sounds like your radar is already giving you the right alarm. Code red. Stranger danger. And the first time I read give you the chicken... I thought he meant cock.", "NTA. It could be innocent but I wouldn\u2019t interact with him alone much less take anything from him. It\u2019s just big creepy vibes", "NTA. It's a creep and I think it's best to ignore him. Even if he's just lonely, it's not a way to talk to a women late at night like that.", "NTA. Trust your instincts. If this guy is giving you the creeps, chances are it's because he IS a creep. Age doesn't cure this. I had such a neighbour, also 60s, being very curious about my life after I moved into that building, asking tons of questions, offering unsolicited advice etc. He was always out in the hallway when I'd come and go. Same as you described, his eyes would travel up and down my body and generally staying around the chest area. At one point he made an inappropriate comment and that's when I stopped interacting. I say hello and get into my apartment without any more conversation. If he asks anything, I keep my reply as short as possible and don't offer any information that he could pick on to continue the conversation. It took some months but I think he finally got the message because he stopped trying.", "NTA, it's creepy. Like compliments are totally fine in the right context, from the right person, but calling a woman a \"beautiful girl\" all the time is just weird. I once had a new coworker, I'm F, 24 and this guy was in his late 40s or so I think. We didn't have much to do with each other but the first time we talked, he decided to randomly interrupt a work-conversation with \"you have suuuch beautiful blue eyes\". It was totally random and misplaced, especially since I'm really short and work in assembly of a technical company and it's been hard to be taken seriously in the past. Like you've been working here for a week, we don't know each other, why do you think this is appropriate? I think if he hadn't quit soon after, I would've avoided him too, even tho I wasn't scared or anything, just weirded out a bit.\nAlso this guy sounds like he thinks you owe him something, which is a huge red flag. A normal person doesn't wait for you to come by, especially since, you haven't been friends for ages and this is like...some kind of ritual. Try to be on the phone with someone when you walk home, in case he tries something or maybe ride a bicycle instead of walking...\nThis is creepy and i don't like it. I guess you could try and explain that nicely to him if he ever confronts you again, when your bf is around tho. It sounds like he might get angry when you reject him...", "Definitely NTA. Always trust your instincts. This guy sounds like if you give him an inch, he\u2019ll take a mile. He\u2019s a creep. Ignore him as much as you can.", "NTA and he\u2019s way creepy.  Keep taking that detour.", "NTA- I'd find it creepy. \nEven if it is totally innocent if it makes you feel uncomfortable, then you shouldn't have to put up with it.", "NTA. It's creepy behavior. He will probably get much less \"nice\" if you start to ignore him or be less friendly to him,  though,  so be prepared for that and don't let it make you question yourself... and be careful, and carry pepper spray or other self defence. \n\nHighly recommend reading \"The Gift of Fear\" by Gavin de Becker. He talks a lot about how women can get themselves into dangerous situations by ignoring their instincts and being polite bc society conditions us to be.  \n\nYour instincts are strong.  Trust yourself.  Good luck!", "NTA. His behaviour is pretty creepy imho.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m not sure what his intentions are. Maybe he is just a lonely old man who\u2019s trying to engage you in conversation. However. If that\u2019s the case, he\u2019s going about it all wrong. Calling you \u2018beautiful girl\u2019 all the time is weird. The chicken thing is also weird. \nThe fact that he is making you feel so uncomfortable makes it completely inappropriate. \n\nIf I was in your position I\u2019d avoid him as much as possible. Even if it meant I had a longer walk home.", "You WNBTA. \nHe maybe a nice and friendly old man but then he can't keep compelling you. Keep some distance in that way and always be on guard. \nMaybe he's just being nice but can't say that about anyone nowadays how they turn out to be.", "YWNBTA, sounds like you're in a bit of a sticky situation. IMO, this guy is definitely creeping you out and it's not okay that he's addressing you like that. If you're not comfortable with it, you have every right to just not say hi anymore. You gotta do what makes you feel safe, you know what I mean? Plus, you don't owe anyone a conversation just because you walk past their house. WIBTA for not wanting to deal with that kinda weirdo? Hell no. Just do you, and don't worry about being polite or anything like that. Your well-being is more important.", "Definitely creepy behavior. Nta. In ye olden days, after cell phones but before texting was preferred, women used to phone a friend to go passed sketchy AH. It's unfortunate, but if you aren't comfortable telling him that his behavior makes you uncomfortable (which is fine and valid, trust your instincts), then phone a friend?", "NTA - he sounds old and pretty harmless. I wouldn\u2019t avoid him or adjust your walk. But I wouldn\u2019t really stop and make idle chit chat anymore either. \u201cNo, I have to get home. Things have been busy! Hope you\u2019re well :)\u201d \n\nFriendly but nonchalant. It doesn\u2019t need to be escalated, but it doesn\u2019t sound like you need to readjust your commute for a bit of awkwardness. It will get better", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

I think it would be best to take some time and distance away from that guy because going there alone at night or alone in general it's not a good idea especially for a young woman such as yourself. Just saying", "That's really creepy. Life REALLY creepy. It sounds like he needs a serious chat about boundaries", "NTA he is a creap", "NTA\n\nAny time a man's behavior towards you changes when another male is around, it's creepy. Avoid this man and start saying no thank you. You don't owe him your time in the name of politeness that he's abusing.", "NAH\n\nWhile I think he doesn't have any malicious intent, you aren't obligated to spent time with him.  \nMy guess is, that he is lonely and enjoys the conversation and wants to make you like him by these flattering words/actions.\n\nDepending on if you like to talk to him in general, you can address the issue and tell him, that the flattery isn't welcome and see how it goes from there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nbtw regarding the chicken, it's not your fault, when he is hinting but not outright saying \"Girl, can I buy you a chicken, so you have something better than soup?\"", "Women need to learn to trust their instincts more and disregard the subtle (and not so subtle) lessons that they should always be nice, be a peacemaker, etc\u2026 if someone is uncomfortable then there\u2019s usually a reason and it\u2019s ok to listen to that and react accordingly.  It\u2019s unfortunate for him if he is in fact lonely but OP is not obligated to resolve that for him.  If she really wants to be kind she can come up with a nice reason not to stop and chat like (in a rush, can\u2019t talk, bye) which offers him no opportunity to find a reason for her to stop (if she said sorry I\u2019m late for dinner he could say I can make you dinner, etc) and don\u2019t say, maybe another day either.  If he persists then start ignoring him, maybe put on headphones if that\u2019s an option.  But OP doesn\u2019t have an obligation to make him feel better or meet his needs.", "P.S. Since he acts different when your boyfriend is around (clear proof he isn't \"just being nice\"), you could lean on that to get rid of the guy.  Ie, if he offers you food again, you could say,  \"Wow, thanks! I'll send [boyfriend] over to pick it up!\" If he invites you over,  act like you assume the invitation is for your boyfriend too, so say \"I'll have to check with [boyfriend]! What time should [boyfriend and I] come over?\" He'll probably be pissed and offended and might stop asking. If he is married, constantly ask him about his wife when you talk. If he says you should come over without your boyfriend, just tell him with a completely straight face that that is a creepy and inappropriate request. No more being nice in a way that gives him creepy \"hope.\"\n\nIgnoring and avoiding him is probably the better option, though.", "If it were innocent he would act the same way when her boyfriend is around.", "Dear heavens, stay away from this creep.

They are lonely and feel happy after talking to a beautiful woman. It doesn't mean it isn't creepy or that it's okay though.

Don't give him room to talk your head off.", "I think of the quote from Kimmy Schmidt uttered by, of all people, Matt fucking Lauer, \"I'm always amazed by what women will do because they're afraid of being rude.\" OP needs to be rude AF."]}
