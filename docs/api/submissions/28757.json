He moved out in early 2023. Our breakup was not peaceful. He had lied about his cancer coming back and \"needing an escape\" to cheat on me with his now-Girlfriend. He then broke up with me 2 days after my Fathers funeral, which he did not attend. We dated for 10 years. He lived in our house for another year after our breakup because he said he couldn't find an apartment. My daughter, who openly does not like him, was also living there at the time.\n\nWe had a dog together. We always called him \"our dog\". But once he moved out he seemed to not care about the dog until my daughter was away at college, and he would walk the dog in random intervals. Recently I have not been available during the 2 hours, twice a week, that he is able to walk the dog. In the past I have been home to open the door for him to get our dog and go. He still has his old keys to my house (not knowing I changed the locks) and in a recent call he insisted that it would be perfectly fine to just walk into my house under no supervision. I told him he couldn't and he started screaming at me over the phone saying that he \"can't understand why I don't trust him\", that \"something must be wrong with me\" \n\nMy Ex was emotionally abusive to me, constantly lying and gaslighting, making me doubt myself. I'm still not completely out of the grasp he had on me. I am struggling to convince myself that it's ok that I won't allow him to invite himself into my house. He thinks I'm being ridiculous and mean-spirited for not letting him come in and grab the dog. My feeling is that a) he can't just walk into my house. I have never felt comfortable with ANYONE entering my house without my permission, let alone someone who broke my trust. And b) How am I supposed to move on and create any kind of autonomy when he can just come and go as he pleases?\n\nBoundaries are something I feel that I don't have with my Ex. He constantly makes me feel like I'm being crazy. I just want to know if I should not make a big deal about him entering my house without me being there. Am I overreacting?", "created_utc": 1697088510, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/175z9oz/aita_for_not_letting_my_ex_use_his_keys_to_enter/", "score": 50, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You can change the locks, the roof, even the color of your grass if you wanted to. Not allowing someone you're not associated with anymore to enter your house is perfectly reasonable.", "NTA for setting this boundary ... but I question how you've handled him since the breakup. Note, I'm assuming your daughter is not his. First, he shouldn't get to live there for another year after the breakup. GTFO; no excuses about apartments, money, etc. Second, no visitation of any pets. The pet is either his or yours; period. Third, #1 & #2 would take this whole 'key to your home ' issue out of play because he wouldn't be around. And that's how it should be. Get him out of your life once and for all.", "NTA. The relationship is over. He lives somewhere else. Lock change was 100% common sense AND, apparently, necessary. So is a call to the local police if he violates your home again.", "NTA, your Ex has proven that he is a liar and a cheat and is untrustworthy and abusive. Even now in this instance, he thinks he can scream at you. To give him the keys to your house is risky unless he is repentant, apologetic and regained the trust over years, none of which appear in your description of the situation.", ">\"can't understand why I don't trust him\",\n\n\"Exhibit A: You cheated on me.\"    \nNTA", "Just block him on everything. Stop allowing him to do and act anyway he wants to. He is using the dog as a reason to stay relevant in your life.\n\n\nAlso, make sure you have changed all your passwords and he doesn\u2019t have access to any bank accounts.", "NTA, you're not overreacting either. The fact that he lost his shit over you setting boundaries means that he still can't grasp how he has hurt you in the past, and he simply doesn't care about your feelings. I would stand your ground and let it be known that you are not going to take his abuse anymore. If he can't take it, then maybe he should hit the road. It sounds like you would be way better off without him anyway.", "NTA\n\n\"b) How am I supposed to move on and create any kind of autonomy when he can just come and go as he pleases?\"\n\nPlease consider that this is exactly what he wants to prevent. He might be trying to gain back controll over you. You wrote it your self , he didn't care for the dog while your daughter was still living with you. Why does he cares now? The dog is yours. Don't allow him to walk your dog anymore. Cut all ties with him. He might try to batle you on this. In the end this might be the only way for you to move on.", "NTA.\n\nYou are not overreacting about the abusive, gaslighting ex.", "NTA, you even feeling like you needed to ask shows how much of a dick he is", "NTA. And you are not overreacting in any way. He gave plenty of reasons not to trust him.\n\nAnd if he keeps pushing it then ask for a key for his place in return. When (not \u201cif\u201d, \u201cwhen\u201d) he says no then ask why he should have a key to your place.", "NTA, just change the lock. Fast.", "NTA. New locks are a must.", "Dude, I wish I could lend you my burly 6'3'' brother. I feel really sad that a person need ask if they were over reacting in this situation.", "NTA. I\u2019d be inclined to discommunicate him from your life entirely.", "NTA - Let me guess though. Before your daughter went away to college, he used to come and visit her. And now she's left, suddenly he loves the dog and needs access to walk it. You used to be together, you aren't now so stop giving this man access to your life let alone your house. \n\nYou are no longer with him. You do have points of connection - child and dog. But you can arrange walks etc at a time of mutal convenience. Consider a dog walker for the dog if he needs walked when you are at work because your ex should not be accessing your house, especially when you are not there.", "NTA. Not overreacting, and if he only cared about the dog after your daughter left for college then it's not the dog he's really there to see. Time to go NC...period. Keep the dog, lose the bonehead.", "NTA. He's trying to manipulate you. He could easily be snooping around your house not just picking up or dropping off your dog. There's nothing mean-spirited or ridiculous about setting boundaries. He needs to respect you and your property, at the moment he's doing neither. Can someone else walk your dog? Is there a doggy day care you can drop him off and pick him up from each day your working? Does his gf know about this? You may need to think about legal action to stop him coming near your house.", "Nta Get security cameras or sell and don't tell him where you have moved to.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
