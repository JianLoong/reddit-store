There still needs to be reasonableness to what is being requested.\n\nI even know situations where the partner was asked to stop a particularly workout routine because she couldn\u2019t do it while pregnant.", "I have three babies. I need my husband to parent how *we* agree to, not with arbitrary rules that *I* set. \n\nI couldn\u2019t take anything other than Tylenol while pregnant, but I didn\u2019t expect him to abstain from excedrin for his headaches or mucinex D for allergies. Because that\u2019s rooted in making him suffer just because I have to. OP\u2019s wife is not asking for support in caring for their child (based on the post). She\u2019s asking him to stop doing a thing he enjoys because she can\u2019t do the thing.", "And I just think comparing something totally controllable like cutting back on drinking to social events vs uncontrollable like can't walk or gluten allergy is dehumanizing (err not the word I'm looking for but lessening those disabilities) disabled people.", "Totally agree.", "You can say wrong things without intending to or with good intention, that doesn't make them okay. \n\nIt's still ableism even if he didn't know it is, or just used clumsy wording. Now he knows, he can avoid it in the future.", ">She can't drink because she is the one carrying the baby. Right now, that responsibility is 100% on her.\n\nActually, she's 3 months postpartum, so the responsibility isn't 100% on her. She can technically drink, yes even while breastfeeding, but she has to balance that with the realities of a 3 month old. He's less restricted since he's not breastfeeding, but he still should be limiting his alcohol around baby care, not drinking whenever he wants. Sounds like he's not stepping up to his responsibility as a father.", "That's not what this is about. Maybe he was nice until they got married or pregnant? People change or just lie about who they are you know..", "I dated a guy with a drinking problem and thought often about how if I got pregnant I'd be very vulnerable and likely need help with things and he'd be drunk and unreliable. I was planning to ask the same if that happened but thankfully I left him first.", "You never have a drink with dinner while out then drive home after?", "Excellent point!", "Absolutely not. Look I despise commenting on these things but you\u2019re being unreasonable you\u2019re entitled to your opinion and you can do as you please but there\u2019s no need to drag other women down ESPECIALLY when you\u2019re wrong.", "Or the wife doesn\u2019t like dealing with a baby AND a drunk husband?", "Ok and you have every right to think that (diminishing those disabilities maybe what you were trying to say). Still doesn\u2019t make it ableism based on its definition. He is not trying to make out able bodied people are superior, nor does he make fun of people with gluten intolerances or mobility issues or claim that they need to be \u201cfixed\u201d in some way. He wasn\u2019t trying to be prejudiced or to discriminate against disabled people, he was trying to say how would wife feel if shoe were on the other foot. Insensitive? maybe. Ableist? We\u2019ll have to agree to disagree.", "You're saying it's ableist because he's apparently equating not being able to walk with not being able to drink, and I'm disagreeing that he thinks that at all.\n\nIt's possible that he said something stupid that sounds like something ableist, and you have read more into it than exists, all at the same time.\n\nAll I'm saying is there's an interpretation of this that doesn't involve playing oppression Olympics because you think this guy is a giant asshole. It's pretty apparent that he was just bringing up situations in which someone is unable to do something, for whatever reason.\n\nThe existence of disability isn't ableist.", "He's not breastfeeding the baby, is he?\n\nThe point still stands, as in, she's the one with the actual physical constraint.\n\nHim wanting to have a drink now and then is not the same as being an absent father, exaggerating shit because you feel like it is just distasteful.\n\nIf it comes out that he is actually being neglectful, then we can talk about that. But as it stands, you're jumping to some nasty conclusions because you've decided on a villain for this story, but these are actual real people.", "Nope I dont", "Generally you have the drink at the beginning of the evening so you have a good 3-4 hours left to absorb it before driving.", "Yes that was it lol.\n\nI suppose. To me it's in the same category of people saying the whole \"if I were a different ethnicity/religion/race x would/wouldn't happen\" as their gotcha in an argument too. To me, it makes it sound like the analogy has a shock factor or something, which means there's prejudice because otherwise why mention the comparison? But I can see why you'd think it's just a poor analogy too.", "He is comparing it though. What's the reason for the example of not walking then? Like why does anything else need to be brought up at all? Especially things that are out of a bodies control, whereas no longer drinking unless it's a social event isn't? The top commentor said it's ableist whataboutism, and even if he didn't mean it to be, it was. \n\n>The existence of disability isn't ableist. \n\nNo but using it to win an argument about not stopping drinking is.", "It's not a total drinking ban.  She asked him to drink only on the weekends and then only at social events.\n\nBut heck, let's lean into your answer.   I agree with you that OP should be able to drink whenever he wants. And since they used to drink together, I think they should start that again.   Every time he has a drink, she has one too.  \n\nIn fact,  they could switch to formula,  and then the wife could drink every night and let OP take care of the kid because she can't restrict his drinking, and he can't restrict hers, right?", "What\u2019s the point of saying it\u2019s subjective? Idk what that has to do with anything or who said it wasn\u2019t subjective? Shes the one who needs it because she has given up a lot of herself. However subjective it may be, him refusing to do one thing for her makes him TA. The only scenario in which this would be even remotely excusable was if she decided to keep the kid despite him not wanting one, and it doesn\u2019t sound like that\u2019s what\u2019s happened. \nYOU ARE JUST THE OP WITH A TA ACCOUNT RIGHT? No one else would defend something as ridiculous for someone else in this sustained a manner.", ">you're jumping to some nasty conclusions\n\nMy conclusion is not being able to see how taking care of a 3 month old and drinking whenever you want (his words) go together. He didn't describe how often (if ever) he's taking the baby and giving her a break, he didn't describe how much he drinks, and he won't answer in the comments to clarify. What conclusions should I draw? \n\nThe \"physical constraints\" argument applied back when she was pregnant, but now it's not just about doing a gesture of solidarity like if someone else has a food allergy. Now she's limiting her drinking because she has an actual baby to care for, which he does as well. He should be limiting his drinking without anyone having to ask him.", "It was to say that if he couldn\u2019t have something due to medical reasons, like alcohol in pregnancy, he wouldn\u2019t expect his wife to give up said item as well. Analogies are not based in reality and are not used as \u201cgotcha\u201d moments, but are instead used to help illustrate a point. I just feel that too many people look for too much to be offended about, which takes away from the people who are genuinely dealing with racism/ableism/classism etc. would I be annoyed if this were given the same ableist classification and seriousness that was given to the person who refused to employ my son because he\u2019s a \u201cr*#%*\u20ac\u201d due to his autism. Yes, I would, because it is in no way the same. These was no malice or intent to discriminate the disabled in this post.", "Yes, that's the very principle of analogies. Presenting situations that are not the same , especially not in scale (as to drive the point home) but that share conceptual identities.\n\nThis was neither ablism, nor whataboutism. It was just an analogy involving disability.", "Dude, he was just using examples of someone not being able to do something, as an analogy for why he doesn't feel he should have to stop doing something when he's not the one with the physical requirement.\n\nHer not drinking because of breastfeeding is not a social choice. That is the point!\n\nThis is not rocket science... if someone just mentioning disability to win an argument is ableism, then your comments are ableist too, by that extremely faulty logic.", "I think depending on how they are drinking, it should never even be a problem. From my reference, my parents drank a few glasses of wine every night, and they both still alternated duties pretty well. i feel that unless either are gonna get blackout drunk, this never should have even been a problem after she gave birth", "You are inventing a new argument.\nThe wife never mentioned his drinking affecting his fathering. Her point is about him doing so becausr SHE can't drink at the moment."]}
