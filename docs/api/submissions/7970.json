Yea, my partner doesn't have to take on more or make sacrifices for me, but the fact that he does makes me feel a lot less alone. \n\nHonestly, I bet it's not just the drinking. Before I got pregnant, my partner and I talked about him quitting pot for the pregnancy because I didn't want to feel jealous or left out all the time. But he hasn't had to quit, because he takes such good care of me all the time. He's always looking up ways to help with morning sickness, making me food, making sure I have water, doing extra chores when I'm not up to it. I couldn't care less about his occational smoking, since he shows he is willing to sacrifice in other ways.", "Kind of true. alcohol can make one very tired, hungover, and or impaired.

He was by my side through thick or thin and that\u2019s what matters to me. Not that he stood in solidarity and didn\u2019t drink/eat sushi/have pate. \n\nLike you I think demanding that your SO doesn\u2019t have what you can\u2019t, without a valid reason behind it (recovering alcoholic trying to stop for baby for example) doesn\u2019t lay the foundations for a healthy relationship, it sows seeds that lead to resentment.", "And that is context that he added later and not in the post when I was reading earlier.

Idc if he drinks occasionally bc it's not really a sacrifice for me to not drink, but if I asked him not to, he'd have no problem doing it because he knows he could never match the sacrifices I've made to grow our family and he'd do whatever he can to show his solidarity, love, and appreciation for me. But I guess that's why they say, \"if he wanted to, he would.\" Not everyone's partner cares enough to make personal sacrifices to show love and support so it's really a moot point. If it has to become an argument then that kinda defeats the purpose."]}
