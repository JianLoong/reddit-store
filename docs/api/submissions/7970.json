If he goes out multiple times a week while she is left home, that's a failure as a partner.\n\nShe isn't telling him he can never drink. But he says he is drinking multiple days a week as well as going out with friends. When does she get to go out without baby? Why does she have to sacrifice multiple things for their baby, but he doesn't? Drinking can and does affect the family as a whole. Especially since OP has yet to say how much he drinks when he does. \n\n(Only because it was mentioned, I'll add that I've also been pregnant a couple times. I also didn't ask my partner to stop drinking, but I don't think asking him to restrict his drinking for a short period of time is incredibly unreasonable.)", "Not the person you were responding to, but if OP thinks not drinking out of solidarity is the same as being prevented from walking, he doesn\u2019t understand what not being able to walk actually feels like.

He said that at first she said he can only drink on the weekends and then later said he can only drink on special occasions. Going by his words and what he told us, that's controlling behaviour. You can't tell someone you can only drink on special occasions. If what you're saying is true and he's going out all the time drinking and leaving his wife alone with the baby multiple times a week and getting drunk of course that's wrong. But he only mentions her rules and I think if it's as he says he is that she now said he can only drink on special occasions then she is, as I said, incredibly unreasonable.", "ohh okay. thank you, people throw the term around a lot so my understanding has been fucked.", "I don't think that's what they were saying... I think they were saying that it's weird to try and force someone to stop doing something because you can't. It's not weird to ask, it does make it easier to have someone in it with you, but he's not an asshole for saying no.\n\nHe was also comparing it to not eating pizza when someone else is allergic to gluten. Clumsy phrasing, but I think there is intent and malice being placed here when a simpler explanation is that he just said something a bit stupid.", "But its an unneeded resolution. Her compromise is one of biological necessity(assuming they both wanted a child), this would be because of a tantrum.", "That\u2019s so bs. I don\u2019t think that forcing him to stop drinking is a compromise, it\u2019s a bloody tantrum, and organ act is not an excuse for that, especially since  he is still present for the kid, hasn\u2019t left any of his parental duties unfulfilled", "Comparing unnecessary compromises to the very necessary requirements of the baby being there is just strange. She *can't* drink because she is the one carrying the baby. Right now, that responsibility is 100% on her.\n\nI agree that he should probably want to do the kind thing for his wife, but not wanting to do this thing doesn't mean he won't be able to do the whole parenting thing. It's not a mutual exclusivity thing here", "He says the baby is three months old so she\u2019s no longer prefnant", "I think that\u2019s part of the problem here.

Where is a differently-abled person being treated poorly by that comment?", "self-hating would be if i felt the need to constantly be coddled because i'm of the biological sex that is able to have, and have had, babies. self-hating would be if i felt i needed to be the exception to the rule of growing up and supporting myself and my family by securing gainful employment because i want t stay home and ride my husband's bank account all the way to retirement and justify it by calculating the salaries of housekeepers, babysitters, etc., when single parents do the same stuff, PLUS hold down a job EVERY SINGLE DAY. self-hating would be demeaning myself by attempting to make others feel sorry for me because i chose to get pregnant and chose to breastfeed/pump, and now can't drink alcohol because of it.\n\nTHOSE TYPES of women are \"bad\"....and not even necessarily that....they're simply lacking sense. to scream for equality in some instances, and demand to be treated differently, in others, is flat out stupid. \n\nand who's to say that a concern is \"reasonable\"? that's a matter of opinion, and, in the majority of these types of posts, if it were to be a man's concern? he'd be torn to bits by the commenters, whereas the women are praised, defended and have an instant army behind them. i don't understand how this is so hard for you to grasp.", "In his explanation for why he may be an asshole he mentions typically drinking Fridays and Saturdays, and going out with friends (I was not trying to say he goes out multiple times a week though thats a possibility).\n\nTbc though we don't have quotes so I'm hesitant to claim she's controlling him so much as trying to get him to agree to something. I do see the change from \"weekends\" to \"events only\" as a potential red flag though. He says she gives him a hard time, but doesn't say she has made threats (such as leaving) or 'punished him' in any way or really any explanation of what she's doing other than set limits.\n\nIn my reading, it seemed like it started off they had an agreement that didn't work out for one reason or another and needs to be reworked. Her hormones are possibly affecting how she goes about it, which is not an excuse but could be having an effect. Or she started off saying \"weekends are fine\" but then he was drinking all weekend and not able to help with the baby and she's not getting a break.\n\nTldr OP needs to answer questions about his drinking and her giving a hard time before this can be decided.", "The resolution is that they have a healthy, happy kid.  She's given up way more than just drinking.  More to the point, it doesn't sound like she was 'having a tantrum'.  In fact,  it started with her asking him to drink less frequently.   So she was making room for him to still be able to. \n\nAlso,  she's trying to get help and support caring for the child and herself,  and OP is only concerned with his fun times. \n\nIf anyone is throwing a tantrum, it's OP.", "Who exactly are you to decide what is \u201cunneeded\u201d?
