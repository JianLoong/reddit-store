My fiancee and I read the comments, and we really got some amazing insight. We thought we'd get some YTAs, but we got none surprisingly. And it really helped us put our wedding in perspective. It really brought us closer, as we've communicated with each other so well. We also looked at other stories of children attending weddings and those stories are SOMETHING. \n\nWe decided to reach out to other family and friends and ask them directly what they thought. As it turns out, the only people who are even considering bringing their kids are Otis and Gina. Everyone else is apparently so ready to have a child-free night, and Carl even asked me why pay for the childcare since pretty much everyone we know isn't bringing their kids. So as this point...we'd ONLY be paying for Otis and Gina's kids. I didn't mention their ages because I didn't think it'd be relevant, but they have 7 year old twins, both identifying as boys.\n  \nMy fiancee and I went to dinner at their house. When we arrived, their boys were playing in the living room, and Gina sent them upstairs just as she was finishing up. We sat, had light talk for a bit, then I mentioned that their kids are the only ones coming to the wedding, and that we're still willing to cover the child care for just their two kids. Gina let loose, saying once again that her kids are \"perfect angels\" and that inviting them won't ruin our \"love BS.\" I could hear the kids playing upstairs, so I said, \"like now? You hear them up there. What are they doing?\" Gina rolled her eyes at this, but Otis called for the kids to come downstairs. And when they came down, both of them were naked. Completely naked. They also had red and black marks on their faces. Gina, looking very annoyed, asked then what the hell were they doing, and in unison, they chanted, \"We're playing SURVIVOR!\" \n\nMy fiancee and I both were holding in our laughter, and even Otis had a moment of stifling a chuckle (He can't deny it. I saw it with my own eyes.) Gina told them to clean up and put on their PJs, then gave a look that would have set us on fire if it could. I said, \"well, angels are usually naked in paintings,\" and Otis and my fiancee both bursted out laughing. Gina stood up and stalked to the kitchen angrily. I yelled back, \"I'm sorry, Gina!\" but the other two were laughing their butts off. \n\nGina came back with a glass of wine and said, \"Fine. Fine. We'll come. But you're covering a babysitter for the night instead of wedding childcare. If they can't come to the ceremony then I'd rather they just stay home. But we'll come.\"  \n\nNow you might think this is an unfair ask. But...I'd rather drop $200 for a one night babysitter than a grand for wedding childcare. But...that's an issue for another day. Thanks everyone for the amazing advice!

He was very happy the kids would have had childcare, and was always  going to come to the wedding.  He said he loves his wife, but I'm his \"favorite little brother\" and there's no way he'd miss my wedding for anyone or anything.  I admit it got me a little misty that my brother was willing to say (and possibly) do that.  The talk led to the dinner stated in the update.\n\nI'm really glad this all worked out with communication.  The nudity I could have done without, though.", "OMG I am laughing so hard there tears running down my face!", "Oh wow the universe is really pulling for you to have the wedding of your dreams lol", "\"well, angels are usually naked in paintings\"\n\nWell played, sir...VERY well played.", "OMG \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "hahahahahaha - that timing! \\*chef's kiss\\*!", "Your link to the original post is not working for me.\n\nAt any rate, this story is more than a little hilarious.", "The timing lmfao!", "Okay, thanks for that story today and the naked angel comment was pure gold.
