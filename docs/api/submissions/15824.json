The fact that her therapist thinks *you're* the cause of her string of abusive partners says everything. It was not your place as sibling to push her, especially if that meant you were pushing her so hard you caused so much internal hurt that she looks for unhealthy and abusive people. That usually happens after someone has been severely mistreated or abused. Frankly she probably chose to see a therapist solely because of you. \n\nIt is not your place to police your sibling, especially because she is an independent, autonomous adult. Let her be an individual and live her life. What she does will look different than your definition of perfect because she is her own unique human, and that's okay. Please stop pushing her to be something she's not, and if you want a continued relationship with your sister, there will be a lot of apologies, space, and work on your end.
