The fact that her therapist thinks *you're* the cause of her string of abusive partners says everything. It was not your place as sibling to push her, especially if that meant you were pushing her so hard you caused so much internal hurt that she looks for unhealthy and abusive people. That usually happens after someone has been severely mistreated or abused. Frankly she probably chose to see a therapist solely because of you. \n\nIt is not your place to police your sibling, especially because she is an independent, autonomous adult. Let her be an individual and live her life. What she does will look different than your definition of perfect because she is her own unique human, and that's okay. Please stop pushing her to be something she's not, and if you want a continued relationship with your sister, there will be a lot of apologies, space, and work on your end.

This is how family helps family grow.", "Not really", "I apologized for making her so upset and I told her I\u2019d be happy to discuss our relationship with her therapist and her in order to help our relationship. I want things to get better and I told her that but I feel like she has a huge victim complex and I told her that. She told me the difference is that she is the one constantly being critiqued. It\u2019s true she doesn\u2019t criticize or try to correct me but I\u2019m the big sister so I just thought that was normal. When addressing me telling her she has a victim complex\u2026She said \u201cwe are all the victims and survivors of our own unique circumstances\u201d. She told me that next time I roll my eyes at her or disrespect her to please try and understand she is just a human with her own unique coping mechanisms. I feel like she never takes any responsibility for what a mess she is.", "This is some fundamentalist level christianity. I grew up christian and most of them love to drink lol.", "I guess to me there is a big difference between slurred speech and inability to have a conversation. Two drinks for example can cause slurred speech, but doesn't mean you are blackout. I really need more context from OP which they don't seem to want to provide.", "It's in the bot mod comment highlighted in green that says:\n\n*\"Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.\"* and talks about the voting guide and such, and then says *\"OP has offered the following explanation for why they think they might be the asshole:\"*\n\nSo it's info that OP has willingly given", "Constructive critique is one thing, but it sounds like OP has criticized their sibling to the point of her ending up in unhealthy and abusive relationships. That sort of thing usually comes from severely toxic or abusive environments. Obviously we can't hear from the sister to get a more well-rounded perspective, but I'm pulling that from OPs comments. Siblings should help guide and  support each other, and sometimes that includes blunt or harsh truths. However, it should never mimic (or potentially be) abuse. That is deeply unhealthy, and never  should be allowed. \n\nIf this was a one-time incident where OP was worried about their sister's alcohol intake and called her out for it, I would understand. But this clearly sounds like a pattern of their sister being heavily policed because she doesn't meet their lofty standards, which likely only OP can reach themselves. Siblings should build each other up, not tear each other down.", "Lol, you clearly have no idea what you are talking about.", "I'd drink too if I had to deal with you. YTA", "\"I'm the big sister so it's normal for me to shit on my younger sister, duh, yeah I dump on her but noticing it is HER victim complex.\" Nah you're just an AH.", "You sound awful.", "At what point did you feel you were saying or doing anything helpful? If you felt constantly judged by someone who you should be able to trust.... how would you feel? \n\nIt appears you want to be right in this situation. There is no right or wrong here. Just 2 flawed people trying their best to get through life. Let go of your idea that you\u2019re a perfectionist. You\u2019re not. Your idea of perfect is yours alone. You\u2019re just controlling. \n\nThe only thing you can be certain about knowing in life is... you know nothing because you only have control of you. You don\u2019t decide for other people. You\u2019re both grown adults. Learn how to be respectful to each other. You should be the last person on the planet to judge your sister. She probably has enough of those people in her life.\n\neta \u2014 you posted this story I am curious if you\u2019re actually interested in learning something from it. This a bunch of objective strangers just guessing based on your information. But you know better than anyone here how you interact with your sister. Is there any room in your life for improvement? Or is this just all her problem to fix?", "YTA - this whole comment it literally victim blaming her again", "But is she actually a mess though? You\u2019ve determined she is but you\u2019re judgment isn\u2019t very sound given that you said she \u201cruined\u201d your Dads birthday when she did nothing wrong. \n\nBeing a big sister doesn\u2019t give you pass to be a dick all the time just because you \u201cthought that was normal\u201d\u2026 cause it\u2019s not. You\u2019re just an AH", "I think it's very rude you're trying to invite yourself to her therapist and control and dictate that to spin your narrative. Older sibling to older sibling here, you are being extremely controlling and judgemental. That's not our job. Perhaps you should see your own therapist to address some of these issues to have more constructive relationships with others without needing to control them. Otherwise, you will continue to push them away.", "And you don\u2019t seem to take any responsibility for how judgey you are.", "I am a big sister and to my recollection I have never critiqued my sister. Especially as a full ass adult. Let her live man.", "I rolled my eyes so hard reading this. OP, you are so judgemental. Listen to your sister. Actually listen, or you'll lose her entirely.", "I'm the perfectionist sister in my family, but I'm younger. Your sister is right, we all cope with our issues differently.  Our family constantly criticized, judged us.  My brain twisted it into \"I will work myself to death to try and be enough.\" My sister's went with \"Nothing I do is ever enough, so why try?\"   \n Every time you criticize your sister, you're poking those wounds and telling her she will never be good enough for you. \n\n You should go to therapy together and unpack all the shared experiences that led you both down those different paths.", "I really can't believe you want to talk to her therapist. The therapist she likely has because of you. They say never go to your therapist with your abuser as it just weaponises your weaknesses for them. Go and talk to your own therapist about your need to contol your sister. Even if she was your daughter, at 31, she's an adult who doesn't need your guidance and judgement and likely never did. Also she likely doesn'tcritisce you not because she doesn't think there are improvements to be made.She just stopped caring a long time ago. Do you ever talk to her outside of events organised around your parents?\n\nShe doesn't have a victim complex - she was telling you that you only have a partial view of her life and to get lost.", "Thanks, I must had ADHD'd right over it.
