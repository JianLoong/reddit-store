Earlier before our marriage, our relationship was tough because his family didn't approve of me being atheist and wanted me to convert to Christianity but I refused. Eventually they came to respect my decision and though I'm not best friends with them, we maintain civility.\n\nWhen me and Mark had our son, Jay (9M) his family sprung into the picture wanting to baptize him because he was a \"Christian\" baby. I respectfully declined and this caused a lot of tension between me and the family. I made it clear that my son was not to be indoctrinated and that he'll find his way to Christianity if he wants to. Me and Mark agreed on this even though his family didn't like it. \n\nJust yesterday, we were going to sleep and I went to check on Jay and to my surprise, I find him kneeling and praying. I thought it was cute and watched him until he noticed me. What really shocked me was him instantly stopping, looking freaked out. He then started apologizing and asking that I don't punish him. I was so confused and asked why I would do that, only to find out from him that my husband has been secretly indoctrinating him into Christianity, which happened during times I was not around or when they went to my in laws. Mark told him to keep all this between themselves because \"I've been affected by an unholy spirit, which would make me severely punish him if I found out he was christian\".\n\nI felt sick after hearing about all this and I told him to keep this conversation between us and that he can pray any time he wants to. I ended up sleeping in his room, disgusted with the thought of being next to Mark. Today after Jay went to school, I confronted Mark about all of this and at first he tried spinning this as if Jay was the one who wanted to be christian but eventually admitted it, justifying it with that his family pressurized him and that it's the \"correct\" way to live. I ended the conversation and we both went to work. After work, I took Jay and packed some of our stuff then headed to my father's house before Mark came back. I plan on staying there until me, Mark and his family have a long overdue conversation and to determine whether this marriage is still worth it. I really can't believe any of this is happening. I feel stupid for not seeing this would happen eventually. However my decision feels rash and that I shouldn't keep Jay away from his father because he has no idea what's going on.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1694645270, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16i1g5p/aita_for_taking_my_son_away_from_my_husband/", "score": 360, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Probably you get 50/50 and an agreement not to disparage either parent with faith being handed as each parent sees fit in their home.

My husband is christian and I'm atheist. Earlier before our marriage, our relationship was tough because his family didn't approve of me being atheist and wanted me to convert to Christianity but I refused. Eventually they came to respect my decision and though I'm not best friends with them, we maintain civility.\n\nWhen me and Mark had our son, Jay (9M) his family sprung into the picture wanting to baptize him because he was a \"Christian\" baby. I respectfully declined and this caused a lot of tension between me and the family. I made it clear that my son was not to be indoctrinated and that he'll find his way to Christianity if he wants to. Me and Mark agreed on this even though his family didn't like it. \n\nJust yesterday, we were going to sleep and I went to check on Jay and to my surprise, I find him kneeling and praying. I thought it was cute and watched him until he noticed me. What really shocked me was him instantly stopping, looking freaked out. He then started apologizing and asking that I don't punish him. I was so confused and asked why I would do that, only to find out from him that my husband has been secretly indoctrinating him into Christianity, which happened during times I was not around or when they went to my in laws. Mark told him to keep all this between themselves because \"I've been affected by an unholy spirit, which would make me severely punish him if I found out he was christian\".\n\nI felt sick after hearing about all this and I told him to keep this conversation between us and that he can pray any time he wants to. I ended up sleeping in his room, disgusted with the thought of being next to Mark. Today after Jay went to school, I confronted Mark about all of this and at first he tried spinning this as if Jay was the one who wanted to be christian but eventually admitted it, justifying it with that his family pressurized him and that it's the \"correct\" way to live. I ended the conversation and we both went to work. After work, I took Jay and packed some of our stuff then headed to my father's house before Mark came back. I plan on staying there until me, Mark and his family have a long overdue conversation and to determine whether this marriage is still worth it. I really can't believe any of this is happening. I feel stupid for not seeing this would happen eventually. However my decision feels rash and that I shouldn't keep Jay away from his father because he has no idea what's going on.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

He can go take his son out of school tomorrow and take him to his parents house just like she did. There\u2019s no custody order. \n\nThis action hurts her son. Because he\u2019s not sophisticated enough to parse blame appropriately. It will make him less likely to tell her what\u2019s happening in the future. To protect his dad, or keep her from getting upset again. Because the last time got upset his family fell apart. If you think dad\u2019s abusive it follows that no action should be taken that makes it less likely her son communicates honestly in the future.\n\nThis was rash and may hurt her in a custody dispute in the future. If you think dad\u2019s abusive it follows that She shouldn\u2019t be doing anything that might jeopardize a favorable outcome in court.", "Then OP should involve the police and file an emergency restraining order or whatever reports are necessary in her area. Otherwise she\u2019s concealing a child's location from their parent, which is going to hurt her chances at custody if she files for divorce. \n\nShe\u2019s going to have a tough time suggesting immediate danger though. The kid was only worried about being caught praying. His relationship with his mom and his behavior is fine otherwise.", "That's what therapists and the like are for. She was also so concerned after hearing this that she immediately went to work. This is clearly something that can be worked out. A child deserves to have a healthy relationship with both parents. Dad needs to get some help, but what he has done is far less than other people have done and never lost their child.", "You're presuming that the OP was open to alternatives instead of demanding her way.  That's not the vibe I'm getting from her.\n\nIt sounds like it's her way or else.\n\nReally, the issue is that she and her husband didn't discuss this issue before they got married.  This is really the whole problem.  They've created a landmine where everybody is going to get hurt.", "Why the fuck are you defending a child abuser?", "That's just your head cannon.\n\nYou've presumed that the OP would be amenable to option and that the others weren't. \n\n It's most likely a choice that wasn't brought up by anyone - because she's adamantly against religion and they are strongly religious in a specific cannon.", "Taking him away from his father is hurting him.", "He traumatized his own kid by making him afraid of his own mother in order to indoctrinate him. I\u2019m very sure a judge isn\u2019t going to take that lightly.", "Now why do you think the kid was worried about being caught?? She is not kidnapping by removing her son from a dangerous man. He is literally trying to scare his own child into believing his mom is possessed. Seriously doubt the judge would just gloss over that, like you\u2019ve done. The mom is brave for doing this.", "You didn't answer my question.", "So if a father abused his child and the mother takes him  away the mother is the one hurting the child? That is incredibly backwards.", "He didn\u2019t make him afraid generally, or she would have noticed sooner. He wanted him to be afraid of his mother finding out about him praying and learning about Christianity in secret. She just reinforced the fear with her behavior. He\u2019s awful, she should have been more careful and not reacted exactly the way he predicted. \n\nYou have no idea what a judge will or will not take lightly, neither do I. Family court judges have biases like anyone else. They make some truly off the wall decisions sometimes. A judge may see her leaving suddenly without warning and no visitation as evidence that she\u2019s attempting to alienate her son from his father.", "Your feelings don\u2019t change the law or what the judge is obliged to do. The legal term is parental kidnapping.\n\nLegally speaking, Mark has as much right to raise his kid religious as OP does to raise him atheist/agnostic. If OP doesn\u2019t follow the right procedures then Mark can get full custody and raise the kid however he wants.", "I did, you just were too busy clicking downvote to comprehend.   \n\n\nOne of us does this for a living and the other person wears red as a rabbit. A judge very likely is not going to look kindly on Mom's action. Real World. I've seen a mother tell a child that their father is trying to kill them and the judge didn't think that warranted anything more than therapy. The actual answer is get into therapy because you will spend tens of thousands otherwise and end up there anyway.", "You\u2019re intentionally not addressing the main issue. Mark is not raising his kid to be religious. He is raising him to be afraid of his mother, that she will punish him for being religious, and that she is possessed. This is parental alienation. It is child abuse.", "Oh shit I'm sorry, you thought my Reddit name is my occupation, I mean ok, I question your intelligence but ok.\n\nThis isn't a law thread this is an \"am I the asshole\" thread, so that's what I'm basing my answer in.\n\nNow to further test your (apparently lacking) intelligence. Your answer to:\n\n\n\"He is brainwashing the kid telling him that she has been possessed by an evil spirit. But he can't say anything because  it's \"our little secret\" would you keep your child with someone that did that?\"\n\nIs\n\n\"Get into therapy\"\n\nThat's like me asking what is 2+2? and your answer being \"yup, that there be some math\"", "If you\u2019re so sure about how courts will view the situation, then why shouldn\u2019t OP do the right thing and report to the police in order to protect both herself and the kid?\n\nI think you\u2019re dodging that because you know the case isn\u2019t that strong. What you think is abusive and fair is not necessarily what the courts think.", "You still won\u2019t acknowledge the abuse. Why is that? \n\nThere are many valid reasons as to why women don\u2019t go to the police when the husband goes batshit crazy. I\u2019m not dodging anything, I do think she has a very strong case, and that it\u2019s in her best interest to start the legal process asap. That\u2019s her decision though, not mine."]}
