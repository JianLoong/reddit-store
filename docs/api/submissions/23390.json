People like her give all us Americans a bad rep. Willful ignorance of different countries laws and cultures and willing to fight over it. Glad you put her in her place.", "NTA. She should have listened to you in the first place when you tried explaining the drinking age in Alberta. You only snapped at her after she continued to yell so IMO she deserved to be told off. Americans seem to always be so shocked that things work differently in other countries lol (I\u2019m American by the way)", "NTA\n\nI'm sure you could have \"handled it nicer\", but if someone is screaming at you and berating you for serving alcohol to people who are legally allowed to drink, then you can reciprocate with just as salty language.", "Dual citizen that has lived on both sides of the border here.

I don't go to Canada fearing I might get shot at any point. Your new AIL should respect the country's laws and societal norms of the country that she's in.", "NTA. The individuals were of legal drinking age in the country you were in, so you weren\u2019t doing anything wrong. If anyone at the wedding didn\u2019t want the 18 year-olds to drink, that\u2019s between them, and not a conflict you\u2019re obligated to get in the middle of. It sounds like you gave her the opportunity to say her piece and calm down, and after she didn\u2019t you lost your patience. You made the effort to apologize, and in spite of that, it sounds like she still continued to behave like a jerk. I think you\u2019ve done just about all you can do, at this point if she wants to be upset that\u2019s on her.", "NTA, and you didn\u2019t serve alcohol to minors. They should have had the wedding in the USA if so concerned (although perhaps Canadian attendance would dwindle\u2026)", "NTA. Probably could have watched your language given that it was a family wedding, but it\u2018s not your fault she got offended because Canada dares to have different laws to the US.", "NTA. She\u2019s in the wrong so she has no leg to stand on. At that point she was being a nuisance. Good on you for being the bigger person and apologising though.", "NTA Glad you had the experience of pearl clutching, LOL. Albertan here, and yeah, at least we have the age for most things equal-you can join the military you can smoke, drink and get married without parental approval once you are 18, Not like the pearl clutchers who send their kids off to war but don't allow them to drink ....but oh yeah, there are states where 14 and 16 year olds can get married.

Turned it on her and asked why she thought it would be ok to be ageist with choosing to not serve some adults (as you were not serving kids). You have minimal criteria on who not to serve - those who are underage, and those who are inebriated. You don't discriminate when serving adults.", "NTA. You were following the law, and the people who were paying you apparently had given you no instruction to do no differently.\n\nThere is a saying: insanity is doing the same thing over again and expecting different results. You had explained the situation to the aunt reasonably and she continued to yell at you (I guess Americans can't get it through their heads that their laws don't matter in other countries), so you needed to do something different to get her to stop causing a scene. Yes, you caused some short term pain, but letting her scream and shout would have caused more problems for the wedding, and better you take the blame than the bride or groom.", "NTA, legal drinking age where you live is 18, so it\u2019s good, if you were serving them even tho they didn\u2019t hit the legal drinking age, YTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
