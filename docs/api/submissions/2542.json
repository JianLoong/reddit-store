My daughter is 16 and about to turn seventeen.  \n\ntheyve never had a mother daughter bond mainly because my daughter was a little more mature when they met. \n\nI\u2019ve never told my girlfriend she is allowed to parent or dictate what my daughter does, obviously unless it\u2019s something that\u2019s physically harming her or others but even then you come to me and I will handle it but my daughter is my daughter she is not our daughter and I\u2019ve made that clear. If my daughter feels as though she will take what my girlfriend says to her (which to my knowledge is nothing dictating, decisions making etc) then she can but I don\u2019t expect or force her to, so long as she respects her generally, she doesn\u2019t have to take orders. That\u2019s what my girlfriend knows and my daughter. \n\nAnd to anyone that thinks this is wrong I don\u2019t care. \nMy daughter has a boyfriend and they go out often her curfew is 11-11:30, I\u2019ve met her boyfriend and he\u2019s a very nice and respectful kid. They\u2019ve been dating for a few months now.\n\nMy daughter and her boyfriend were going out, and my girlfriend stopped them to ask where they were going and I at first thought nothing of it. She told them to be back by 7:00, it was 5:00, i said 11:00 is fine and to call if anything. \n\nMy girlfriend ended up texting my daughter, I can\u2019t make this up every fifteen minutes,, and once I asked her what she was doing I told her to stop, we know where they are and if they have any issues they will call.\n\nFor the moment she stopped but after this everytime they went out she continued to text her and if she didn\u2019t response she someone got her boyfriends phone number and would message him. My daughter showed me the messages \n\nI was mad, this isn\u2019t her kid, my kid my rules, and she doesn\u2019t get to harass my kid because of what she thinks is a decent curfew. \n\nI addressed her about this and she said that she was looking out for the kids and she doesn\u2019t know where they are at so she will find out one way or another and she should know regularly when something happens or they go somewhere else. \n\nI said that they aren\u2019t bar hopping and she has no need to know where these kids are at, I know where they are at, and she won\u2019t continue to talk to my kid this way and she needed to remind herself that this is my kid not hers, if she was being harmed I wouldn\u2019t allow this but she\u2019s not so she doesn\u2019t get a choice in what I do with my kid, and I don\u2019t want her to try to do something like this without my knowledge again. \n\nShe did it again and my daughter sent me a screenshot, all I said was block her, and she did, and my girlfriend was pissed saying that she wanted to know where she was and I\u2019m being ignorant to not make sure she\u2019s in contact regularly, and staying out this lates means *someone* has to watch the kids since I won\u2019t. \n\nI told her she needed to leave, and to not message my kid again.", "created_utc": 1668689985, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yxpmj6/aita_for_having_my_kid_block_my_girlfriend/", "score": 144, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She had no business crossing both of your boundaries when they have been made perfectly clear and are absolutely reasonable. \n\nOf you're interested in staying with her, maybr it would be wise to know why she is suddenly acting all paranoid and controlling after four years.

That is a perfectly sound and reasonable boundary that your girlfriend chose to trample over.

Next year she's an adult. Your gf/ex-gf totally flipped her wig.", "NTA\n\nMay I recommend you check your phone and car for trackers. Maybe even cameras on your home. \nHer behaviour isn't normal.

And that you waited 2 years before you involved your daughter in your relationship.\n\nYour girlfriend crosses your boundaries, despite clear parenting agreements. Your daughter don't need a 3th parent. If your girlfriend continues to behave like this, i would end the relationship if i was you. Your child comes before everything.
