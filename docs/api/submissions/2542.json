If she\u2019s been silently opposed to your parenting choices all this time, that\u2019s a conversation she needs to have with you, it\u2019s obviously not appropriate for her to take matters into her own hands. \n\nI say this as the adult child of a parent who put their romantic relationship above the health and happiness of their kid: Y W B T A if you continued to have a relationship with a person who so blatantly disrespects you and your child\u2019s boundaries.

If she needs to vent, great but again, not through \"parenting\" his daughter.", "So are you staying with this woman, cause if your are maybe couples counseling. She\u2019s definitely got some issues here", "NTA. When reading the first sentence where you told your daughter to block your girlfriend, I thought that was strange. Then reading the rest of the story, it makes total sense! Does your girlfriend have some anxiety issues? How couldn't she realize that this constant texting would be ruining her date?", "NTA Who the hell calls someone every 15 minutes? Stalkers. Major controlling assholes whose full title would violate rule 1.", "NTA but your gf is. She's crossing the boundary multiple times. Why stay if she obviously doesn't respect you?", "NTA, you\u2019re correct that\u2019s it\u2019s YOUR daughter and YOUR rules. You literally told her no, and if she\u2019s not respecting your boundaries you need to get her out of your life.", "NTA\n\nYou know you don't have to keep dating her, right? Disrespecting your role as her dad and harassing your kid when you have deemed your kid responsible for herself? No. You'll end up with your daughter distancing herself to get away from your gf.", "NTA.  Your daughter will contact you if there is an issue.

Any problem your daughter has you can solve and you can tell your GF if you need her help with something.", "NTA \n\nbut it is strange that this behaviour started out of nowhere. It's almost as if something triggered it. some options:\n\n1. your girlfriend is losing control and going nuts\n2. she knows/saw something regarding the boyfriend/your daughter\n3. she has had some real bad experience in her past that has triggered this overprotection of your daughter.\n\nYou are completely right in establishing and protecting the boundaries of your relationship with your daughter. But if your girlfriend is going through something that is manifesting in this behavior, maybe instead of only aggressively telling your girlfriend to butt out, maybe you could also speak to her about what her reasoning is really about", "NTA.  She has some significant boundary issues.", "NTA.  So glad you are sticking up for your daughter.  I hope the boyfriend also blocks her.  You need to really look at your relationship with your GF.  She is stomping your and your daughter's boundaries and when it is pointed out that she is overstepping, she is doubling down that she will do whatever she wants.", "NTA.\n\nYour GF is a controlling AH. What you do with your nearly adult kid is none of her fucking business. She is disrespecting your bohndaried. Does she do this in any other respect? If she does, ask yourself some questions.", "NTA. She has no say as the girlfriend. This is beyond weird, seriously rethink this relationship.", "NTA.", "NTA \n\nDO NOT MARRY this women OP- she has no respect for you or your daughter or your boundaries.\n\nShe is literally evil step mom material and will make your daughters life miserable", "Good grief. Even if your kid was 12, your gf would be severely overstepping. Your daughter is nearly an adult, certainly old enough to spend evenings out, especially if she\u2019s shown no signs of being in trouble otherwise. NTA. Please rethink this relationship. Your daughter (and you) deserve better.", "NTA\n\nGood on you for sticking up for your kid.\n\nMy grandmother is EXACTLY like your gf. And I can tell you that being on the receiving end of that much crazy led to big problems for me mentally and emotionally. Keep doing what you\u2019re doing, and keep being a good parent. You and your daughter will be glad you upheld your boundaries.", "NTA. Please don\u2019t stop to defend your daughter in this situation. Your girlfriend\u2019s behavior is waaaaaay out of line.

Or if your daughter was using public transport and there was a long interruption. But harassing her for no reason? No way.", "NTA. I was 16/17 with no curfew. I didn't take advantage of no curfew and my step-dad never called me or text me freaking out. You know you raised your daughter right. You know the type of person you raised.

C'mon.", "NTA\n\nAs a stepmom myself and my stepchild being in high school when his dad and I married this is totally unacceptable behavior from the girlfriend.  You did right by telling your daughter to block the girlfriend.\n\nHonestly, I would have considered this a test for the girlfriend that she failed spectacularly.  If the girlfriend could not follow a simple boundary that you put in place when it came to your daughter then hopefully you see that she will be a nightmare for any children down the line and downgrade the girlfriend to an ex-girlfriend.", "NTA, you're the parent, she is not. Is this a sudden thing that she has no history of doing? If so, what gives?", "This is what I said on the other post about step moms\n\n\"Sweetie, she never planned on not being mom to your kid. She figured you'd both change your mind when you saw she was right.\n\nShe's wrong.

My partner and I have been together for 8 years.  His daughter was 7 when we began dating and will be 16 in January.  My partner has full custody.  I would NEVER dream of parenting my step-daughter.

All that comes from my partner.

As I can attest having been a teenager once.", "Was your GF a victim of some sort of abuse? I was thinking that might be why she is so over protective of your daughter and doesn't want the same thing to happen to her.", "NTA, OP. GF is TA! Text and phone as birth control/control freak. \n\nFuck that! \n\nMy kid was more responsible at 16 than most adults.

Grow up and go your own ways.", "You rewrote a post? Lol. \nWe all fully support you.\nYour gf is psycho. What is wrong with her?\nDo her parents know where she is every hour? Seriously, if you have her mom\u2019s phone , while you are out with your gf, call the mother. Every hour. Giving her an update on her daughter\u2019s whereabouts. I mean after all, how can her mother know where her daughter and what her daughter is doing unless you update her. Make sure your gf hears each phone call. \nIt\u2019s petty.
