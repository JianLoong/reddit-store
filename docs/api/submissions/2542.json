It might be worth having a conversation all together about her fears so your gf can manage her anxieties better.

It\u2019s extremely weird that after 4 years of respecting the boundary you set, she would suddenly decide to stomp all over them. She needs to explain herself. If she has information you don\u2019t that is causing her to behave this way, she needs to share it. If she\u2019s been silently opposed to your parenting choices all this time, that\u2019s a conversation she needs to have with you, it\u2019s obviously not appropriate for her to take matters into her own hands. \n\nI say this as the adult child of a parent who put their romantic relationship above the health and happiness of their kid: Y W B T A if you continued to have a relationship with a person who so blatantly disrespects you and your child\u2019s boundaries.

Or if it is really about safety maybe she was assaulted at that age. OP has to have serious talk with her about the why, not just telling her to stay away.", "The why would help for sure but the why shouldn't impact the daughter at all. That's something that should stay between them as she works on getting passed whatevers driving her, not something she works out through his kid. If she needs therapy great, that's her thing and he can support her while still being the only one to parent his daughter. If she needs to vent, great but again, not through \"parenting\" his daughter."]}
