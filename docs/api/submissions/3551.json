But I\u2019ll describe the situation because I think that matters. So I (27M) have been dating my girlfriend Sarah (26F) for about 6 months. We had a situation-ship before that so we\u2019ve known each other for about a year and a half. No issues between us. Me and her sister on the other hand.. really don\u2019t see eye to eye. Her sister is Courtney and she is a 24F. \n\nMe and Courtney just have very different world views. We keep everything respectful but we really differ on things. About a year ago Courtney came to our place and told us she had some big career change. She was gonna keep bartending but was gonna start an OF. Sarah supported her decision but did say she didn\u2019t love the idea. I asked her if she ever planned to have kids. She said she wasn\u2019t sure yet and it wouldn\u2019t matter. I said that her pics are the internet forever, just think about the situation you are putting any potential kids in. She told me to shut up and mind my business. She went ahead and started doing OF. My GF has been dealing with the fallout. Her family is all kinda of fucked up about it. Which pisses me off because now Sarah is more stressed and we get the residual shit come our way from her parents. Tbh it\u2019s been a pain in the ass. And it\u2019s embarrassing whenever my friends would bring it up to me. \n\n7 months ago Courtney started to date someone seriously. The guy was very much looking for something serious. He even mentioned that he didn\u2019t love Courtney being a bartender long-term. Big problem was that Courtney had yet to tell him about the OF. I knew she never told him. I was told to not say anything and eventually she would tell him. 7 months later and he was still being lied too. So I had a friend send him the link anonymously. \n\nSo this Sunday I\u2019m watching red zone with Sarah. It\u2019s my apartment. Sarah spends the night pretty much every night. But it\u2019s not our place. It\u2019s mine. So Courtney comes over balling. Saying her BF just broke up with her over the OF. Sunday NFL redzone is my happy place. I look forward to it every single week. And now I got some crying woman on my couch. Like full on balling. I asked her to be quiet and was told to stop. I said absolutely not. It\u2019s my apartment and my time. I refuse for it to be ruined by her. Also that it\u2019s her own fault. If she was truthful maybe she wouldn\u2019t be in this position and I warned her whenever she started doing it. She did it all to herself and to either shut up or leave. Eventually my GF and her sister left. I enjoyed the rest of my Sunday. My GF is telling me I need to apologize. I said it\u2019s my place, and her sister needed to hear the truth not be coddled anymore. And I won\u2019t apologize for stating facts. AITA?\n\nEdit: for those asking. Yes I told my GF that I was the one who did it. I had a friend do it to attempt to stay out of the drama. My GF isn\u2019t mad because she knew her sister should have done it herself.", "created_utc": 1669766928, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z8ay85/aita_for_telling_my_girlfriends_crying_sister_to/", "score": 599, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But I\u2019ll describe the situation because I think that matters. So I (27M) have been dating my girlfriend Sarah (26F) for about 6 months. We had a situation-ship before that so we\u2019ve known each other for about a year and a half. No issues between us. Me and her sister on the other hand.. really don\u2019t see eye to eye. Her sister is Courtney and she is a 24F. \n\nMe and Courtney just have very different world views. We keep everything respectful but we really differ on things. About a year ago Courtney came to our place and told us she had some big career change. She was gonna keep bartending but was gonna start an OF. Sarah supported her decision but did say she didn\u2019t love the idea. I asked her if she ever planned to have kids. She said she wasn\u2019t sure yet and it wouldn\u2019t matter. I said that her pics are the internet forever, just think about the situation you are putting any potential kids in. She told me to shut up and kind my business. She went ahead and started doing OF. My GF has been dealing with the fallout. Her family is all kinda of fucked up about it. Which pisses me off because now Sarah is more stressed and we get the residual shit come our way from her parents. Tbh it\u2019s been a pain in the ass. And it\u2019s embarrassing whenever my friends would bring it up to me. \n\n7 months ago Courtney started to date someone seriously. The guy was very much looking for something serious. He even mentioned that he didn\u2019t love Courtney being a bartender long-term Big problem was that Courtney has yet to tell him about the OF. I knew she never told him. I was told to not say anything and eventually she would tell him. 7 months later and he was still being lied too. So I had a friend send him the link anonymously. \n\nSo this Sunday I\u2019m watching red zone with Sarah. It\u2019s my apartment. Sarah spends the night pretty much every night. But it\u2019s not our place. It\u2019s mine. So Courtney comes over balling. Saying her BF just broke up with her over the OF. Sunday NFL redzone is my happy place. I look forward to it every single week. And now I got some crying woman on my couch. Like full on balling. I asked her to be quiet and was told to stop. I said absolutely not. It\u2019s my apartment and my time. I refuse for it to be ruined by her. Also that it\u2019s her own fault. If she was truthful maybe she wouldn\u2019t be in this position and I warned her whenever she started doing it. She did it all to herself and to either shut up or leave. Eventually my GF and her sister left. I enjoyed the rest of my Sunday. My GF is telling me I need to apologize. I said it\u2019s my place, and her sister needed to hear the truth not be coddled anymore. And I won\u2019t apologize for stating facts.

Not telling the person you are dating about stuff like OF is unfair to the partner. \n\nI have no idea wtf people are on here. Do you guys support lying to your partners? Sure the guy she is dating can\u2019t tell her what to and not to do but he has every right not being with someone doing something he doesn\u2019t agree with. She was LYING to him and tricking him. A relationship like that was never going to last the bf would have found out about the OF at some point and realized he is being lied to. Relationships are built on trust and honesty and the fact she wanted to wait for even more than 6 months to tell him means she knew he was not ok with it and was IMPOSING her morals and preferences onto him. \n\nThe bf was entitled to know that information before he invested 7 months into the relationship and before he invested more.

Other people are and that\u2019s good for them. If I spent 7 months building what I thought was a serious relationship and it came out I would be devastated at the deceit and the betrayal.

If this were about a woman knowing a man is cheating on his partner or somehow hiding something similar to an OF from his partner, EVERYONE would be saying that the partner deserves to know and how would \"I would like to know if it was me\". Well \"he deserved to know\" and she definitely caused this to herself. You can't start a relationship with lies and expect it to last. I would hate to spend 2, 3 or more months with someone only to discover they lied about something so important to me. I would be devastated. So yes he deserved to have all the info and decide if this is someone he wanted to spend his time with. So definitely nta, for saying or telling her to shut up or leave. However, going forward you should probably stay out of those things if you wanna stay with your gf. A lot of people are loyal to their family and while now she seems fine with it, it may not be the case in the future.

AITA?\u201d", "WiThOuT iNvOlViNg My SunDaY,  It's only fair you involved yourself in her personal business, let her inconvenience a DAY,  Since you obviously have no respect for months", ">Or use my Gf as your therapist. If you wanna be independent then be that. \n\nHeaven for-fucking-bid sisters chat and gossip and share their problems and rely on each other.\n\nIndependent doesn't mean never speaking to people.\n\n\nYTA.", "Sounds like you don't care what anyone has to say. Why even ask if you're the AH if you don't listen to the advice?", "Someone asked \u201c did you tell your girlfriend that you were the one who told the boyfriend?\u201d I think this is important, since you know honesty is SUPER important in your life! Also, you stuck your nose in someone else\u2019s business and now you are dealing with the fallout. Classic", "Wow. You deliberately blew up someone else\u2019s rltp because \u2026\u2026. you are mad at them? And then are whining about having to deal with the fallout. Hunty, YTA, and I\u2019m hoping your gf sees you for what you are and flees. This is petty and malicious, and gross. You don\u2019t even actually care about this beyond how it mildly inconveniences your rltp.", "You literally snitched on her when it wasn\u2019t your place lol you\u2019re such an AH dude", "How about don\u2019t get involved in someone else\u2019s business? You should\u2019ve asked them to leave A LONG time ago. Before this time. \n\nSet boundaries. You don\u2019t want drama in your place? Say you don\u2019t want her there. Tell your GF to meet her sister somewhere else. Regardless, you\u2019re the asshole for how you treated your girlfriend, her sister, and forcing yourself into this situation.", "God I hope your girlfriend leaves you how fucking pathetic you are. Or you could just leave the room and watch it somewhere else. OR OR better yet, your damn girlfriend to take her sister somewhere else.", "Involved self in drama he didn't need to by deliberately snitching.\n\nComplains about losing Sunday.", "I agree", "If your girlfriend knows that you\u2019re the one who sent this information to her sisters boyfriend and knows that you\u2019re a raging misogynist and hasn\u2019t broken up with you? Then yeah, she\u2019s kind of shitty too. Though not nearly as much as you. \n\n\u201cI won\u2019t engage in conversations about this\u201d is a complete sentence. Your girlfriend\u2019s sister\u2019s actions don\u2019t need to affect either of you more than you choose for it to. People get to choose how they respond to and feel about things a lot more than we give ourselves credit for.", "It does, but there's healthier, if more difficult, ways to deal with nosy assholes than dropping a nuke on your GF's sister's relationship and any inconvenient fallout is entirely your own fault because you took the easy asshole route.", "Don't date prudes then. It's just tips and sex. Who cares. Grow up.", "Your girlfriend and her parents aren\u2019t asking you how they can fuck little sis and if you get sexually aroused to your gf little sister. \nThere is a difference between not liking that she is doing it, and trying to get sexual gratification out of it while also being derogatory towards her. \n\nI have plenty of friends who have done porn etc, and surprise! I\u2019ve never had to fend off questions like that because my friends aren\u2019t creeps.", "Just say you're a perv and gob", "Her mental health WILL affect you HOWEVER that still doesn\u2019t give you the right to take it into your own hands. You\u2019re trying to justify your shitty actions and it\u2019s failing.", "OP states that the girl herself conceded that he broke up with her because of the OF. Let's not pretend we can't see what's pretty obvious here. Sure OP may have had some less than stellar motivation, but it's not an AH move to let someone know they're being cheated on, regardless of why someone chose to tell you.\n\nIt's not an AH move for a person to have an OF and date, marry, have kids, whatever. It's an AH move when something like they is being hidden from your partner because you *know* they won't approve.", "It is his house\u2026 \nIf he is not entitled to peace in his own home then I wonder who is.", "Love how you don\u2019t answer the direct question but ask me plenty lol. So I\u2019ll ask this\u2026 if he was gonna buy a ring and she STILL has not told him. Then is it okay?", "Agreed. At least do the tattling yourself.", "Tbh it is harming him in the fact she is lieing by omission about their relationship and wasting his time. \n\nWhen you lie to a so for 7 months it can give them", "Once again. \"Because of OF\" doesn't give the actual reasoning. OP meddled in a relationship that wasn't his. \nIt's entirely possible that if Courtney had brought this up to her partner in her own time that they wouldn't have broken up. But OP decided to be a weird AH and didn't even directly tell him so absolutely no points for that. OP did not do this to help out the ex.", "He's entitled to his peace, sure.\n\nI suspect that he may be getting a lot more peace than he wanted, when his ass gets dumped.", "Being an entitled AH in his own house doesn't make him any less of an entitled AH.\n\nHe purposefully made his friend message the girls BF because he doesn't like her and now he's manipulating everyone in the comment section by acting like he cares about her while also claiming it's entirely her fault and that he won't \"apologize for facts.\"", "Honestly, yes. It's a job she does. Should she have shared that she does it with SO? I would have. Should she at least have a conversation about whether she should continue doing so? I would too. Would it cause problems later if she kept it to herself? Probably. But it's not about what I would do. \n\nI debated giving the direct answer to your last question. My answer seriously doesn't matter, which is why I didn't give it. But the answer is I know people that take their clothes off professionally. From strippers to profession models that do nude jobs. I've known sex workers. There is no shame in any of those professions. It's work. Often harder work than it seems. If my SO had an OF, I'd probably be ok with it. It's. A. Job. If I had limits I'd line them out and have a discussion.", "Get it through your thick skull: *It's not your fucking business. End of.*", "Have you told your girlfriend that you are directly responsible for the sister's BF finding out about the OF?", "I guess that\u2019s that then. Probably it\u2019ll be good for the both of them. Not that OP\u2019s GF is wrong in this. She herself is facing all this due to her sister\u2019s lying.", "Okay so the length of time is where your moral compass ticks in? I was just curious is all. So you admit that it would be wrong for him to marry her without knowing the truth? But her wasting 7 months of his time is okay? I\u2019m just trying to understand here. I agree it\u2019s her business. But whenever you are in a relationship\u2026 honesty is important no?", "Obviously the boyfriend wasn't ok with it and he had a right to decide that for himself before he wasted years of his life with this woman. She can do whatever she wants, but once she decided to be in a committed relationship with someone, he has the right to know. Many people would consider that cheating. I certainly would. The sister obviously knew how her BF would feel, hence why she lied about it for so long. Maybe OP's motives weren't the best in why he told, but telling the poor guy was the right thing to do.", "Why though? \n\nWhy is it morally right to be a bystander to wrong actions because we are not participants in a relationship?\n\nNot your business isn\u2019t an answer and can be used to justify the absence of moral responsibility in any situation."]}
