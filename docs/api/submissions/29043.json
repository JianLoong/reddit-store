Maybe it's a thing in his family. \n\nBut deciding you're cooking and not even properly communicating it is rude af. Even if you lived in the US and had the day off, it's still extremely rude. The fact that you work a long shift makes it unfathomably inconsiderate.\n\nTypically, Thanksgiving cooking takes all day. Wake up, have breakfast, & even if you're a relative bringing a few dishes (which is commom), most of the day is spent cooking, then everyone gets together and eats in the afternoon since there's SO much cooking involved.\n\nThis guy you're dating is incomsiderate & immature AF.

Stand your ground here.", "Definitely NTA. Just because you agreed to host the party at your house does not mean that you automatically cook the meal. You have to work; therefore, it is up to him to figure out the food. It is not just the woman who can cook. My husband makes the stuffing and cooks the turkey, and I do the rest of the sides and the desserts. If he truly saw you as a partner, then he would have discussed cooking with you BEFORE telling everyone that you would handle it. He needs to learn how to respect you and treat you as an equal.", "NTA this is not small stuff. You are not his mother or his personal chef.

He made plans assuming you'd be cooking, when you clarified you weren't, he should've just made other plans.", "NTA and expecting you to cook for them is a massive red flag. If he can't cook a meal without mommy around maybe he should take a good hard look at himself.", "NTA. It was totally presumptuous of him to just assume that you would spend days prepping and cooking for a huge group to celebrate HIS holiday. (And it does take DAYS to prepare a full thanksgiving for that many people). He should have done literally anything to plan this instead of assuming that you\u2019d know what he wanted despite never having experienced the holiday before. \n\nThis is also a big clue about how he feels women should behave at holidays. In some families the women spend days in the kitchen doing all the work and the men barely even notice because they\u2019re too busy watching football.

Your SO offered your house for a gathering and just assumed you would do all the work to feed his guests. That's unacceptable.  He wants a big day like that then he plans and does it all himself.

Wait, there is going to be 13 people (including you and your boyfriend). Why can't everyone make one or two dishes to bring? This would take lots off of your back and makes it so things are split.

Why would you be the one cooking if he didn\u2019t even ask you to? Like what would you even make, you don\u2019t know what the traditional foods are since you\u2019re not American", "His being a bad cook doesn\u2019t make it okay for him to hoist the responsibility of the time money and effort onto you. He can learn or buy it all premade or have his friends cook.", "I have an excellent recipe that I can send to your bf", "You don't need to.\n\nI'll tell you how Friendsgivings are traditionally handled in the US.\n\nThe host decorates the table and has plates, glasses, etc. The host cooks the main protein, usually turkey and maybe buys the breads if they're not being homemade. Everyone else is assigned dishes to bring. That's all the sides and the desserts. \n\nHow drinks are handled depends on what you're drinking and how much. \n\nAfterward, everyone cleans up. Anyone who wants leftovers makes a plate. Then people take home the leftovers of what they brought.\n\nThough pumpkin pie is easy if you use a premade crust and canned filling. Then top with canned whipped cream.", "Restaurants might still arrogant of him", "Yeah spending days researching what is expected in a Thanksgiving meal, finding where you can source the non-local ingredients, researching what recipes you can do in your kitchen and with what ingredients you can get, going and getting those ingredients, and then spending a half day minimum doing the cooking,  and then probably doing all the serving and cleaning, for someone who is completely taking all this for granted because you have similar genitals to their mother, is such small spuds.", "Right.  That\u2019s why I said either OP or her boyfriend.", "I didn't say they should. I just suggested having everyone bting one dish.", "THANKSPIMPING", "Can i thankspimp myself? I promise I got better angles then that trashy Turkey with its legs spread open anyway", "Yeah the whole man yeeted himself across the Atlantic / Pacific with that remark\n\nAirlines hate him", ">Thankspimping\n\nI am DECEASED", "I love the Thankspimping!  \n\nMy grown kids who come on vacations still assume I will do all the cooking and hubby and I the cleanup. until reminded each trip (to a timeshare condo or cabin) that they will do some of the shopping, cooking, cleanup. They are not little kids any more, and Because parents want time off too! Said kids get told to pay for some activities too....", "This is the only time of the year I go nuts for some turkey, green bean casserole, cranberry sauce on the turkey, stuffing w/gravy (not my favorite thing to eat but I get a little), and pumpkin pie loaded with cool whip. I purposely don't take my ADHD meds on this day so I can eat more til I am stuffed and then just a little more.", "My father does all the cooking in my parents' home. And prior to that arrangement, my mom did most of the weekly/basic cooking but Dad did all the big meals including holidays. I (F) do Thanksgiving now but only because I love the food. It's my favorite meal of the year! OP's bf is being totally sexist.", "I am a guy and really enjoy doing the holiday meals. Share cooking normally but it's fun to make tasty art that everyone loves. Its a real sense of accomplishment.", "A partner who may never have cooked a whole turkey in their life, no less. I have done it twice now, and I'm middle aged.", ">Shit, last year my son helped me cook thanksgiving dinner.\n\nMy son ask me and my Mom to cook for Thanksgiving every year but he pick and clean the greens, chop up onions, celery, green/red/yellow pepper (for the dressing) and cook the turkey. He would never ask us to do all of the work (like OP's BF did) without contributing at least 3/8 of the work.", "Oh my goodness I didn't even think of this point- it's not even OP's holiday! So not only is BF assuming she'll cook for all of his friends at her house but that she'll research the traditional recipes and make them likely for the first time??!!\"\n\nOP, please call his mom if you are on speaking terms and let her know her son is hosting Thanksgiving and he would like your recipes so that HE can get started on cooking.", "It's his turn this year. I look forward to the break, not so much the eating, lol. He is a nice Irish lad, who hasn't quite learned about seasoning, or that everything doesn't have to be boiled, lol! He is very proud of his cooking, however, so we all eat it with a smile. He'll never know the truth...\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "No no, take that /s off.

Thanks! :3", "AND 'so far into asshole territory that he's already back across the Atlantic' my oh my.", "I feel like there might be money to be made from trans-oceanic yeeting of assholes.", "Sure!  It's pretty easy.  After so many years, I pretty much make it by the seat of my pants.\n\nI use RiceSelect Royal Blend for the rice, making it per the instructions on the package, but substituting chicken stock (preferably homemade) for water.  2 cups (pre-cook) usually makes enough for us.\n\nWhile the rice is cooking I brown up a pound of ground Italian sausage.\n\nOnce the sausage is cooked, remove it from the pan leaving the fat.\n\nUse the fat to cook half a chopped onion and a chopped shallot, until the onion is translucent.  Remove the onion and shallot from the pan.\n\nMix together the cooked rice, the sausage, and the onion and shallot.  At this point, if you like, you can add some chopped up fresh herbs - I like to put in sage and thyme.\n\nPut your rice mixture in a 9 x 9 Pyrex dish and bake at 350 deg for 45 to 60 minutes, depending on how much of a crunch you'd like on top.", "You can debone a turkey???? Does it still look like a turkey or is it in pieces??  I'm just imagining a raw turkey buf flopping around like jello, lol.", "Yeah no doubt, yeet my countrymen back when they have behaved badly. I'm not promising to fish them out of the North Sea but I doubt that's a problem", "We just order everything from a local store. Already cooked. Pick up the day before and reheat. Oddly is is fine reheated. We use paper plates and stuff.
