It's about how badly he is treating you and his belief he is perfectly at liberty to do so because it serves what HE wants.

Maybe it's a thing in his family. \n\nBut deciding you're cooking and not even properly communicating it is rude af. Even if you lived in the US and had the day off, it's still extremely rude. The fact that you work a long shift makes it unfathomably inconsiderate.\n\nTypically, Thanksgiving cooking takes all day. Wake up, have breakfast, & even if you're a relative bringing a few dishes (which is commom), most of the day is spent cooking, then everyone gets together and eats in the afternoon since there's SO much cooking involved.\n\nThis guy you're dating is incomsiderate & immature AF.

Stand your ground here.", "Definitely NTA. Just because you agreed to host the party at your house does not mean that you automatically cook the meal. You have to work; therefore, it is up to him to figure out the food. It is not just the woman who can cook. My husband makes the stuffing and cooks the turkey, and I do the rest of the sides and the desserts. If he truly saw you as a partner, then he would have discussed cooking with you BEFORE telling everyone that you would handle it. He needs to learn how to respect you and treat you as an equal.", "NTA this is not small stuff. You are not his mother or his personal chef.

He made plans assuming you'd be cooking, when you clarified you weren't, he should've just made other plans.", "NTA and expecting you to cook for them is a massive red flag. If he can't cook a meal without mommy around maybe he should take a good hard look at himself.", "NTA. It was totally presumptuous of him to just assume that you would spend days prepping and cooking for a huge group to celebrate HIS holiday. (And it does take DAYS to prepare a full thanksgiving for that many people). He should have done literally anything to plan this instead of assuming that you\u2019d know what he wanted despite never having experienced the holiday before. \n\nThis is also a big clue about how he feels women should behave at holidays. In some families the women spend days in the kitchen doing all the work and the men barely even notice because they\u2019re too busy watching football.

Your SO offered your house for a gathering and just assumed you would do all the work to feed his guests. That's unacceptable.  He wants a big day like that then he plans and does it all himself.

Wait, there is going to be 13 people (including you and your boyfriend). Why can't everyone make one or two dishes to bring? This would take lots off of your back and makes it so things are split.

Because it\u2019s not about the food. It\u2019s about spending time with family or friends you care about. \n\nGood luck dealing with the bf.", "He can learn.  Everyone is a terrible cook when they start.  I started at 15 and by 22, I could make all my basic dishes using recipes.  By 27-28 I could improvise and fix mistakes.  Now at 35, I can make my own recipes from ingredients, substitute and balance on the fly and have a solid understanding of food chemistry and physics (a.k.a. why certain things are cut certain way and why certain things are done in certain order).  It takes a long time but if you just say \"Yo I'm bad at it\", you'll never learn.\n\nEven if he wasn't a sexist prick who you absolutely should dump, if someone is bad at cooking, make them make you a slightly technical dish once a week until they get good.  Technical doesn't mean complicated.  Omelette is technical.  Egg fried rice is technical.  Cacio el Pepe is technical (3 ingredients).  Aglio e Olio is technical (4 ingredients).  Making homemade mayonaisse is technical (3 ingredients + flavors).  Just keep trying.\n\nSaying \"I'm bad at cooking\" is such a cop out and men tend to use it more than women, even the usually not this blatantly terrible ones.", "Your boyfriend is a terrible cook because he knows that if he doesn't screw up dinner, he will have to cook. It's called weaponized incompetence. I bet he ruins clothes in the wash too.", "Was he going to offer to help at all? Even at least get ingredients in preparation? Do anything besides throwing you into the fire while he gets to play football? \n\nDo not take a day off work to cook since he didn't even have a proper discussion with you and just assumed everything. There needs to be a proper discussion about all this and reevaluate if this relationship is worth it. I would never \"offer\" my partner like this without asking and talking with her first.", "There are so many groceries stores and restaurants in the USA that offer a whole roasted turkey for people who want to host but can\u2019t cook. He\u2019s an idiot. \n\nAnd I always order pie from a bakery.", "Thanksgiving can be an American holiday where people can come together and enjoy each other\u2019s company over delicious food.  I have been blessed to attend a few of this type of Thanksgiving.\n\nHowever, Thanksgiving is usually the American holiday where all the year\u2019s drama comes to a boiling point and craziness ensues.  Looks like you\u2019re experiencing this type early this year!\n\nYou\u2019ve already told your boyfriend no, which is a great start.  Time to drive that point home!\n\nIt\u2019s actually quite common for everyone who comes to Thanksgiving to bring a dish to share.  The host (your boyfriend) would make the turkey and possibly the drinks, while his friends would handle the side dishes and the dessert.  \n\nI have hosted Thanksgiving before, and it meant 5 days of cleaning, grocery shopping and food prep!  It was fun, but a hell of a lot of work.  \n\nAll of this should fall fully on your boyfriend, since it\u2019s his holiday.  If he expects you to do it all because \u201cduh you\u2019re the woman this stuff is your job!\u201d then it\u2019s time to consider that the two of you aren\u2019t compatible.", "Exactly.  Cleaning out fridge to make room to thaw turkey starts Saturday.  Sun/Mon to Wednesday is thawing turkey, depending on size.  Wednesday is brining turkey.  Thursday is smoking turkey.\n\nAnd then there is everything else.", "Not in his book, hes a man.  Hes going to play football with his friends while his woman slaves in the kitchen for him because she must obey his wishes\n\nProbably a throwback to 3 decades ago", "\ud83d\ude02", "I bummed because this year is my husband's turn to cook (we both like doing it). Mine is better...", "Lol I am the control freak - I cook the dish im cooking myself \ud83e\udd23\n\n>I'm not a fan of traditional bread-based dressing, so quite a few years ago found a wild rice-Italian sausage dressing to make instead.\n\nThat sounds really good!", "My husband debones the turkey, and makes a roulade with stuffing. It's fabulous. \n\nGenerally I do the sides, desserts.", "2 of my brothers once put on a Thanksgiving meal for 16 people.  And did a great job.   The best kind of men know how to cook, as well as clean.", "But, they aren't in the US - part of the issue.", "Bahaha that is me!  My in-laws asked about skipping this year so she didn't have to cook.  So I offered.\n\nNow they're backpedaling and saying maybe they'll host.\n\nMy food is better than hers and she in es it and it bugs her.  She's a great person, but as she ages she's doing WEIRD stuff to food.\n\nIf she cooks I'll probably eat before I head over lolol", "I've never considered deboning a turkey. I'm about 90% sure I'd fuck it up though. Sounds good though.", "My nephews are fantastic cooks. All of them, from both siblings. Eldest nephew is quite capable of making all the Thanksgiving dishes and he has been since middle school.\n\nAnd so is my father (who learned to cook after the divorce) and both my BILs.", "My point was that not being able to cook is not a reason for the BF to make GF cook. There are workarounds.", "Oh, we take the turkey apart every year. Fry the wings, make a roulade with the breast, braise the thighs, make sausage out of the bits left over. Everything cooks better and faster and there is more variety. It makes a nice looking platter too.", "The first year he did it, it was pretty messy. But he gets quicker every year.", "My parents made sure we knew ALL jobs.  My brothers learned how to cook, clean, and sew, while my sister and I know how to swing a hammer and do basic car maintenance.", "Sounds yummy."]}
