{"id": 319, "submission_id": "yij0un", "title": "AITA for wanting my stepdads brother to stop hanging around the house?", "selftext": "My mom and I (19f) have been moving from house to house for about 5-6 years since she divorced my dad. About 4 years ago she met my now stepdad (Dave fake name) and about 2 years ago we moved in with him at his house. Dave has a brother (fake name will be John) that has been helping with projects around the house for the past 3-4 months. First it was remolding the master bath, then redoing the floors in some rooms. He fixed my leaky faucet which was amazing. It\u2019s nice to have things fixed around the house. However this is where my mom and I start to have problems. John is still doing more projects. We thought he would be gone by now. He usually gets there at around 7-8 in the morning and stays until 5-6 working on things. So he does not stay over night, but my mom gets annoyed when he tries to insert himself into my mom and stepdads  relaxing time at the end of the day. Dave has no problems with John being there. It\u2019s his house so he can have whoever he wants over. My mom just wants to have privacy which I agree with. I\u2019m tired of having him sit around all the time (which he has started to do.) My mom is getting annoyed with him. We are thankful for all the help John has given us but I feel as though he needs to respect that my mom doesn\u2019t want him over every day. It gets annoying when I wake up to drilling and hammering in the morning but by noon he just sits around and sometimes does some work. Dave gets mad anytime we say something about it. I\u2019m not allowed to speak of it at all. My mom and I are just tired of having John over almost every day of the week. What was my final straw was a couple days ago, my mom has never had a night to herself in 2-3 years. She constantly takes care of Dave who has back problems. This was the night she was happy about. It was around 7 in the afternoon when my mom texted me that John came over and just started sitting around on his IPad doing things. I told her that she needed to tell him to get out. He has no business being there. He didn\u2019t leave until an hour passed I think. I was pissed but I can\u2019t do anything. It\u2019s Dave\u2019s house technically, but it\u2019s like my mom doesn\u2019t even live there to him, it\u2019s like she has no say so in her own privacy. I feel like the a-hole because it\u2019s his house and family, but does he not respect that my mom and I want privacy? \n\nSo AITA for wanting my stepdad\u2018s brother to stop working on projects around the house and give us some privacy?\n\nEdit: thank you to all who have replied so fast. I wanted to clarify some things. I do plan to move out soon I am trying to work to save money. My mom has expressed she doesn\u2019t like him being around all the time. She has tried to tell Dave many times. John has helped with all the important things already, he is doing stuff like building things outside that we didn\u2019t need now. He is at the house almost every day and most days he isn\u2019t doing anything. My mom also pays for a least half of the bills and expenses is what she told me. She also buys all the groceries and does the cleaning. (It\u2019s a big house) Dave has a 12 year old daughter that is over half the week and she eats everything.", "created_utc": 1667238299, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yij0un/aita_for_wanting_my_stepdads_brother_to_stop/", "score": 7, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But it sounds like Dave has serious back problems and John has been making much-needed repairs around the house.  Maybe he's lonely and enjoys the \"family\" environment. You have a right to be frustrated, but Dave has a right to have his brother over, especially when he's actually helping.  What if the roles were reversed and Dave told your mom to throw you out so they could have some privacy?\n\nSince it's just feelings and not actions at stake, NAH.", "Info: does your mother pay rent? Do you?", "So, let me get this straight - you are happy with the free and/or cheap labor and that things that need repair are, in fact, being repaired, but don\u2019t want to be bothered with the family member who is performing the labor? Are you planning on paying for all of the fixes/remodels that the home needs out of your own pocket? If the answer is \u201cno\u201d, then you really don\u2019t have a say in how things are handled. YTA. \n\nAlso, you\u2019re an adult now. If you don\u2019t like that one of the homeowners is allowing his family member (who is also now a member of your family) to spend time at their home, you can totally move out. Unless you feel threatened by this man (sexually threatening, physical violence, he\u2019s a drunkard, etc.), you really have zero say in who is or is not allowed in your home or the time frame in which they can or should be there. If this is an issue your mother has, she should be addressing it with her spouse as it is her home too since they are married, not you. You don\u2019t control the situation here. You are more than welcome to talk with your stepfather about things, but you need to figure out if this is something you can deal with when he, most likely, tells you that the situation isn\u2019t going to change. Save money, get your own apartment and then you are the person who decides who can visit and how long they can be there.", "YTA\n\nThis ain\u2019t your house. Get a job and move out if you want privacy.\n\nAs for your mom, she may have a claim here. They\u2019re married, so she definitely has a right to ask your stepdad to outline some boundaries. If he can\u2019t respect that, she should do something about it. But that, unfortunately, has absolutely nothing to do with you.", "YTA - you are a grown adult, if you don't like where you live, move and take your mother with you.    \nI come to this conclusion because I think many people that do not have to live with plumbing issues and disrepair in their house would wish they lived in a house where everything is quickly repaired.  \nYou say that this is Dave's house and your mom is unhappy - BUT IS SHE SAYING ANYTHING?  If she is unhappy with Dave, she needs to either figure it out or say something to her husband.   \nIs your mom one of those people that just likes to complain for sympathy?", "NAH.\n\nYou're fully justified in feeling the way you do, but you need to find a way to move out of that house. If your mom has no say in this in her marriage, she should probably consider doing the same.\n\nThat said, if Dave/John are happy with the way things are and aren't doing something to actually make anyone unsafe, it's hard to argue they don't have that right. It makes Dave a bad husband, but not inherently a bad person.", "YTA you are an adult if you want privacy, MOVE OUT. It\u2019s not your house, you don\u2019t get a say, your mom doesn\u2019t like it she needs to talk to Dave but unless she can pay someone to do the work or she is willing to do it, she really has no grounds to tell him to stop.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
