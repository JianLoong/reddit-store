Since she was little, she was behaving a bit off, like being overly obsessed with certain themes for months, making weird comparisons between people and things she saw on the internet as well as struggling to understand other people's feelings or emotions. She is in process of getting diagnosed and so far the doctor suspects she might be on the spectrum, but it is getting harder to diagnose her correctly as she is learning to mask the patterns.\n\nI also have an older sister \"Sarah\" who is currently pregnant with her 3rd child. My sister is significantly shorter compared to me and has always looked skinny. While Mia have seen other people pregnant, she haven't seen Mia pregnant as her older children are a bit older then Mia.\n\nLast week we went to see my parents to celebrate Easter, I was there with Mia and my husband and Sarah came with her family too. Sometime during dinner Sarah had to excuse herself to go to the bathroom and stood up and Mia made a comment comparing her to one of the aliens(the worm looking ones?) from the \"Men in black\" cartoon (Mia is currently obsessed with aliens and is watching everything that is appropriate for her age). Pretty much everyone found it hilarious (including Sarah's husband and her kids), but Sarah. Sarah got immediately upset and demanded Mia to apologize to her and to be punished, suggesting she shouldn't be allowed to have a dessert and then banned from TV for sometime when we are back. Mia was confused as she saw people laughing and didn't mean any harm, so I have quietly explained to her why her auntie got upset, so Mia has apologised to her. However I have said she is allowed to have the dessert and I am not going to punish her as she meant no harm.\n\nBecause of this Sarah wanted to leave early and have been messaging me saying I am behaving like an asshole for not punishing Mia for \"insulting\" her. I have disagreed as it was not Mia's intention to insult anyone and reminded her that when Mia compared Sarah or Sarah's husband to cartoon characters, she always found it funny, but Sarah is not having any of it and keeps creating drama. Our parents are on my side as they believe Sarah is just being super emotional due to pregnancy, but I want to check if I am being an asshole here for not punishing my daughter?\n\nEdit: I'm not really familiar with men in black universe, so unsure of the names of the characters.
