It\u2019s awesome that you celebrate your son\u2019s adoption day. But inviting the whole class to both parties is too much. It has nothing to do with the presents or lack of.

I make every effort to get my kiddo to each one she\u2019s invited to. On one hand I very much appreciate the invitations and the good times the parties provide, but on the other hand, getting her to these parties can be stressful. Accepting a party invitation, because my kiddo doesn\u2019t want to miss out or disappoint the host, sometimes means  I have to hire a sitter to drop her off and pick her up, or rearrange my already scheduled appointments. I know lots of other, even two parent families are spread pretty thin. \n\nAll that said, I\u2019m happy to make the effort for one birthday per kid, per year.

It's a cookout, celebration, etc. - any event that implies that your potential guests need not bring anything besides themselves. Given what you've said here and how the parent reacted to the invite, the wording of the invite might imply that gifts were appropriate, despite the disclaimer you had saying otherwise.

Then it just becomes a gift grab.", "Might be a constant reminder that he's not biological. I can understand the first year maybe but after that just seems like a bit much.", "Not every adoptee enjoys that type of thing.\n\n- Adoption can come with a lot of trauma or just complicated so celebrating it can also be complex. \n- It can also be very other-ing, and a reminder you're not the same as your siblings and family members.", "I'm guessing that the gift thing is the issue. Celebrating is absolutely not wrong and no one should have an issue with that, but I can see where it might be frustrating for other parents if it isn't clear whether or not gifts are expected.\n\nTo be clear, I think the other parent was way out of line in trying to dictate how you should parent your own kid.", "Does the Dad in question know that?", "I agree he could have said no, and he didn't have to be a dick about it.  I just also kinda get where he's coming from.\n\nAnd typically if you have two kids, you're inviting two different sets of people because your kids are different ages and therefore have different classmates/playmates.\n\nI didn't even put on one party every year, so I certainly can't imagine hosting two but the OP is well within her rights to do so.   There are probably also going to be a number of invited families who opt out of attending two every year.  Others will love any excuse for a party and would happily come if you threw 4 a year.", "I have several kids and they invite their own friends to their parties, it's not the same guests at all of their birthdays. Two similar(ish) parties for one child with same guests seems problematic. Adoption day seems like something that could be celebrated as family.", "Info: do classmates ever bring him gifts? And if so, do you accept them? The judgement for me hinges on this. It\u2019s one thing if you\u2019re having a picnic and it\u2019s another to have a party where some folks will feel obligated to get him something. If it\u2019s a no gifts event, it should be so firmly where no gifts are allowed", "Sure - OP indicated in one of their comments that they don't expect presents, nor have people brought presents to this event in the past.", "But why does that matter?", "I guess that just never occurred to me because no one had ever tried to bring a gift before.", "I don't know. He didn't bring it up.", "I actually don't understand where he is coming from.  It's easy enough to say no, whether it's because you are busy, don't want to do anything that weekend, don't particularly care to spend more time with the party hosts, etc.  I think it's entirely inappropriate to make a comment on whether someone should have a party for a particular event and to criticize the parenting of someone one doesn't even really know.", "No, no one has ever brought gifts. That would be a bit weird, I think.", "Okay well my guess is that he didn't know, for whatever reason, and he thought you were on a gift grab. Maybe explain to him that you don't expect gifts, you just want your son to have a fun day with his friends.", "Get used to weird. You're an adoptive parent now so weird comes with the territory! \ud83d\ude1c\nI fucking hated the \"adoption day\" parties. It only reminded me more that I was not their actual child and different from everyone else. I put a stop to it as soon as I could.", "NTA, as long as there's no pressure to give gifts.", "I had a public celebration for my actual birthdate, and a private celebration for my adoption day.  Soft YTA.   Just publicly celebrate one and have a big private second one", "My youngest has 2 birthdays. She's a 26 week preemie, so she has an actual birthday and an adjusted birthday. She's 8 now, so we don't do anything anymore for her adjusted birthday, but when we did, we just did something small in the family. \nAbsolutely nothing wrong with doing 2 parties, celebrating him joining your family. Maybe just say no gifts please come celebrate with us?", "My husband is adopted. He says the \"gotcha day\" is a CLOSE family event. Even if you indicate 'no gifts', people will feel it's still expected. I do understand wanting to celebrate, but inviting everyone is excessive. Yes, your son is special, but isn't everyone's child? Being adopted isn't THAT unique. YTA, but not in a harsh way.", "Depends how you market it. If you say it\u2019s a birthday in June, or any expectation of gifts, I think that would be excessive. No issue having a celebration though. The parent could just politely decline - he doesn\u2019t need to insult you around what you do in your family. NTA", "YTA", "NTA if that's what you want to do, do it. Personally, I don't agree making adoption day like a birthday, because adoption is more of a family celebration, not a public thing. But he's your kid, not mine. \n\nMy suggestion would be to not ask for gifts for both, like specifically say \"no gifts\" for one of the parties so that guests don't feel like they're supporting your kid.\n\nBut the other parent was out of line - if they don't want to go to the party, just decline. There's no reason to put any parent down for celebrating their kid.", "Why would having two be a problem?", "OP said that they don't expect gifts, and people don't bring them. An invitation is not a command; if you don't want to go, don't go. There is absolutely nothing wrong with offering hospitality to other people, even if you extend the offer more than once a year.\n\nI'm honestly stunned that so many people are so eager to be offended and upset that they will now do so in response to someone saying 'hey, we'd love it if you could come enjoy free food and a fun afternoon at the beach with us'. No one is ever compelled to attend any party; no one \"has to\" organize transportation or anything else. OP made a nice offer, and people are free to accept or decline; there is absolutely no justification for anyone being anything other than gracious in response.", "How on earth was OP an AH in any way?", "NTA- my first reaction is he\u2019s probably upset about  needing to get another gift, or he\u2019s just a killjoy. I saw your invitation wording and I would have wondered if gifts were expected. Don\u2019t worry about it or add \u201cno presents please\u201d to the invite to avoid confusion and this type of dickish confrontation. Have fun celebrating your family!", "this you? https://getyarn.io/yarn-clip/03fbd968-b210-41da-b187-649be1f3404b", "Yeah, she should specify that in the invite.", "As equally as possible... While taking into consideration the extra tricky dynamic of the adoption, which can be super challenging to navigate. Lol. \nI mean, my cousins little kids get pissy when one has a birthday and the other get ignored for a day. There's second cakes involved now and sibling gifts! SIBLING. GIFTS. It's challenging for all bio related families even!", "And when, like OP, you *don't* expect people to bring gifts? When you are simply providing them with free food on a beach? Where's the problem then?", "Because these things are normal gift giving events and people will still bring gifts or feel awkward.\n\nAn annual celebration of an adoption should be a family event.", "I don't know why, but I have heard many, many adult adoptees say these kind of things were hurtful growing up."]}
