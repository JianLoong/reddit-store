{"id": 14376, "submission_id": "12gn8lz", "title": "UPDATE- AITA for interrupting my son's date so he could pick up his little sister?", "selftext": "Hello all, thank you very much for the comments left on my post, spent a good hour going through threads and seeing what everyone had to say. Reading the comments made me realise that I had been quite soft with Max\u2019s upbringing which made him feel comfortable speaking to me the way he did that night.\n\nI also have to admit that I have spoiled him, handing him everything he asks for - probably because I don\u2019t want him to feel like he lacks all the things his peers have because he doesn\u2019t have his mother in his life. Not really the best reasoning.\n\nI had a discussion with Max about what happened a few days ago while Liza was away. He did try his best to have his grounding removed and car privileges back but I stayed firm and that kind of shocked him, (he\u2019s used to getting his way) but he understood he was in the wrong.\n\nMax did get quite emotional during the conversation and apologised for his behaviour, that night and before, he knew that while he was too late to fix his past mistakes he\u2019d make sure not to repeat them, he even offered to pick Liza on days when he didn\u2019t have soccer training or plans.\n\nAfter many comments advising me to do so, I made an (anonymous) complaint to HR about my manager\u2019s tendency to bring up last minute tasks, apparently a few other people in my department have also had this happen but were unafraid of saying anything in fear of losing their jobs. From what HR has emailed us, it\u2019s currently being dealt with.\n\nI was embarrassingly unable to say anything to Liza\u2019s friend\u2019s mother except for giving her a few dirty looks (while she wasn\u2019t looking), there were many comments questioning what I would do in the case this happened again and right now it\u2019s Max. We\u2019ve had a mutual agreement and he\u2019s understood that he needs to also help out in the family.\n\nThe situation isn\u2019t ideal but we\u2019re making it work.\n\nOnce again, thank you all very much for the comments/advice given.", "created_utc": 1681055840, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12gn8lz/update_aita_for_interrupting_my_sons_date_so_he/", "score": 93, "replies": ["[Original post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/127wkyz/aita_for_interrupting_my_sons_date_so_he_could/)", "Was looking forward to an update on this situation, glad to see you could come to some sort of agreement between you and your son. Don't be too hard on yourself about his behaviour, you may have spoiled him but it seems like he still knows when he's in the wrong and not.\n\nWishing you and your family the best, you seem like a good dad who's just trying his best to raise his two kids to be good people.", "That is a good update, thanks for sharing and I hope your relationship with Max will grow stronger :)", "Glad to see the update!", "It\u2019s not easy. But, you did great!", "Good on you for doing what needed to be done with Max. Not always easy, especially when you're the only parent, and same goes for with your job too.", "Well done, Dad.", "That's good news!", "This is such BS. Your teenager is grounded for THREE MONTHS because you failed to have a back up plan in place. Lack of planning on your part doesn't create an emergency he is responsible for fixing. You know your boss springs last minute overtime on you. This wasn't a new thing. Parenting means having a back of plan", "YTA. You didn't deal with a problem at work, interrupted your son's date because of it and grounded him, all because you didn't deal with a work issue.\n\nYour terrible parenting is a separate issue; you shouldn't spoil him rotten until he's 17, then demand he toe the line. There was never a line before and you're punishing him for your inability to deal with your manager's inappropriate last-minute demands.\n\nIt's not a great look to punish your child because you're too passive to deal with bad management", "Three WEEKs. Read the original post. Family members help one another out. That\u2019s how it is. It\u2019s the expectation of families. OP stated he had Max pick up his daughter 3 times in the last year. 3 times.", "There isn't a judgement to be made anymore lol. And his son can help out from time to time, and even his son acknowledges that.", "A thousand times, this.  OP\u2019s arrogance is nauseating."]}
