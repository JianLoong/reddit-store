{"id": 14376, "submission_id": "12gn8lz", "title": "UPDATE- AITA for interrupting my son's date so he could pick up his little sister?", "selftext": "Hello all, thank you very much for the comments left on my post, spent a good hour going through threads and seeing what everyone had to say. Reading the comments made me realise that I had been quite soft with Max\u2019s upbringing which made him feel comfortable speaking to me the way he did that night.\n\nI also have to admit that I have spoiled him, handing him everything he asks for - probably because I don\u2019t want him to feel like he lacks all the things his peers have because he doesn\u2019t have his mother in his life. Not really the best reasoning.\n\nI had a discussion with Max about what happened a few days ago while Liza was away. He did try his best to have his grounding removed and car privileges back but I stayed firm and that kind of shocked him, (he\u2019s used to getting his way) but he understood he was in the wrong.\n\nMax did get quite emotional during the conversation and apologised for his behaviour, that night and before, he knew that while he was too late to fix his past mistakes he\u2019d make sure not to repeat them, he even offered to pick Liza on days when he didn\u2019t have soccer training or plans.\n\nAfter many comments advising me to do so, I made an (anonymous) complaint to HR about my manager\u2019s tendency to bring up last minute tasks, apparently a few other people in my department have also had this happen but were unafraid of saying anything in fear of losing their jobs. From what HR has emailed us, it\u2019s currently being dealt with.\n\nI was embarrassingly unable to say anything to Liza\u2019s friend\u2019s mother except for giving her a few dirty looks (while she wasn\u2019t looking), there were many comments questioning what I would do in the case this happened again and right now it\u2019s Max. We\u2019ve had a mutual agreement and he\u2019s understood that he needs to also help out in the family.\n\nThe situation isn\u2019t ideal but we\u2019re making it work.\n\nOnce again, thank you all very much for the comments/advice given.", "created_utc": 1681055840, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12gn8lz/update_aita_for_interrupting_my_sons_date_so_he/", "score": 751, "replies": ["[Original post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/127wkyz/aita_for_interrupting_my_sons_date_so_he_could/)", "Was looking forward to an update on this situation, glad to see you could come to some sort of agreement between you and your son. Don't be too hard on yourself about his behaviour, you may have spoiled him but it seems like he still knows when he's in the wrong and not.\n\nWishing you and your family the best, you seem like a good dad who's just trying his best to raise his two kids to be good people.", "That is a good update, thanks for sharing and I hope your relationship with Max will grow stronger :)", "Glad to see the update!", "It\u2019s not easy. But, you did great!", "Good on you for doing what needed to be done with Max. Not always easy, especially when you're the only parent, and same goes for with your job too.", "Well done, Dad.", "That's good news!", "This is such BS. Your teenager is grounded for THREE MONTHS because you failed to have a back up plan in place. Lack of planning on your part doesn't create an emergency he is responsible for fixing. You know your boss springs last minute overtime on you. This wasn't a new thing. Parenting means having a back of plan", "YTA. You didn't deal with a problem at work, interrupted your son's date because of it and grounded him, all because you didn't deal with a work issue.\n\nYour terrible parenting is a separate issue; you shouldn't spoil him rotten until he's 17, then demand he toe the line. There was never a line before and you're punishing him for your inability to deal with your manager's inappropriate last-minute demands.\n\nIt's not a great look to punish your child because you're too passive to deal with bad management", "Three WEEKs. Read the original post. Family members help one another out. That\u2019s how it is. It\u2019s the expectation of families. OP stated he had Max pick up his daughter 3 times in the last year. 3 times.", "There isn't a judgement to be made anymore lol. And his son can help out from time to time, and even his son acknowledges that.", "A thousand times, this.  OP\u2019s arrogance is nauseating.", "You should give your daughter a question that Liza's friend's mother is unable to answer. Something like what is the speed of sound? Light? What is absolute zero? The atomic weight of potassium? The speed of an unladen swallow? You get the idea. She may be able to reverse Uno, putting the mom on the spot.", "There is never a perfect situation, the lady was rude, completely out of character for you, then help a mother out and grab the kid and figure it out.  I\u2019m glad you all figured it out, you always try to give your kids more then you ever have to make them happy, it backfires!  Living the same way!", ">I was embarrassingly unable to say anything to Liza\u2019s friend\u2019s mother except for giving her a few dirty looks (while she wasn\u2019t looking), \n\nEmbarassing is very much the correct word here, man. I have a lot of sympathy for you but if you can't stand up for yourself you need to at least learn to stand up for your children.", "I had a lot to say about this post so I\u2019m happy for this update. Parenting out of guilt is unhealthy. I\u2019m happy it is working out. Continue to have those healthy expectations and boundaries with your children and everyone else for that matter.", "YTA.  You were overworked and blamed your children like every other parent does when they can't keep up.  \n\nChildren are not parents; they grow the hell up.\n\n----\n\nI know I will be downvoted for this because parents feel their children should suck it up when they can't do it, but those parents are wrong, and their children will remind them of this when they are older, and they refuse to take care of them.\n\n> Children are not pancakes that can be thrown away when you get a bad batch.", "Your lack of a spine created this whole mess and you\u2019re still pathetic enough to make an anonymous report.", "Just wondering - where was your son on the date? Like, out of town, a restaurant, ect.", "I love the update. Focus on the present and moving forward. Best of luck to you and your family!", "Continue to have those healthy expectations and boundaries with your children and everyone else for that matter.", "African or european?", "The speed of an unladen swallow, I'd have to ask back if it was an African or European.", "The car is not a right, it's a privilege.  \n\nIf the kid can't help out 3 times in 18 months maybe the answer to to take the car away and cancel the insurance and use the money to hire a nanny.", "Yup. Can't believe he punishes his son for his own failure, way to deflect responsibility. Hope his son sees how irresponsible OP is and leaves home at 18. OP is the AH. Gross.", "Anonymous report wound up helping OP's coworkers (who were also too nervous to report). Anonymity exists for a reason, Isaacromerx.", "I dont knooooooooooooow!", "Who are you, who is so wise in the way of Science?", "Where did op say that the teenager doesn't pay for their own driving expenses?", "Comments", "I\u2019m glad this worked out but I can\u2019t believe people are still commenting Y T A here. Like damn, God forbid a parent expect their kids to help out in unexpected circumstances thrice in the span of a year and a half in return for a car they don\u2019t have to pay for. I truly cannot imagine the entitlement and lack of compassion it takes to judge OP harshly here. \n\nAnyway, good to see a positive update. Hopefully this isn\u2019t an issue again.", "Yta still. He's a child. Not a parent. You need to grow a spine. At least your sons got one and will stand up for himself. Even if you have battered him into submission by taking his things away.", "yet another \"parent\" forcing their kids to be the parent of their siblings.", "What would have happened if liza was your only kid and I'm not being funny but wfh was common practice during lockdown so you could have finished working from home your employer is at fault here", "Well done! Happy Update! <3", "Hey you are doing a great job. Parenting is hard.", "I'm glad this ended in a good way. It's always good to see updates like this. \n\nHave a nice day :)", "Thanks for the update. It sounds like you handled the situation well. Your son sounds like a pretty decent kid who just has some growing up to do.\n\nNow as to Liza's friend's mother, LOL, I bet she has no idea that she makes your daughter so uncomfortable with the math questions. She no doubt thinks she is making learning fun.t is worth a gentle word with her too when the opportunity comes up.", "I am ashamed to say that my wife didn't get the reference. My step-daughters did though... :)", "Maybe she's jealous... she doesn't want to pick her own child.  So possible that why she wants to send someone to do for her?  lol", "I had a whole ass explanation typed for why you were not thinking this through but I realized it doesn\u2019t matter as you\u2019re clearly on a bit of a crusade. \n\nSo all I\u2019ll say is, there\u2019s a difference between expecting a daily concierge service and needing your nearly adult child to use the car you pay for to help you out so you don\u2019t jeopardize the money you make that provides them with these luxuries.", "No judgement needed anymore. If you can\u2019t ask your child to help out three times within 18 months, I\u2019m not sure what you can do then \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "R/unexpectedmontypython", "Upvote for this reference", "And yet you married this woman?? \ud83d\ude03", "Your lack of understanding of work dynamics and difficulties of being a single parent is nauseating.", "you know- whenever there is a random ass comment like this I am NEVER surprised that it is yet another thing I have forgotten from Monty Python LOL", "And that there\u2019s a whole sub for it \ud83d\ude02", "lol I just thought it was one of those made up sub links. I get fooled like half the time these days I didnt even click it", "Oh no, my friend, that is a whole legit thing. Enjoy.", "Ok ok, I will click. Thanks friend :)"]}
