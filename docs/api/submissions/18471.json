I (44m) have a friend, we\u2019ll call her Fran, who is a single mother to a young son named Derek. When Derek turned 10, Fran got him a guinea pig for his birthday. The little guy is named Coco.\r  \n\r  \nWell, for a little while, Coco got plenty of attention, even though I felt like his cage too small. But it didn\u2019t take long for Derek to lose interest in Coco. When I visited, which was about once a week, I often mention to Fran and Derek that the cage needs to be cleaned and changed as it was often filthy and smelly. I also noticed Coco wasn\u2019t getting enough food. He needed hay, pellets, and veggies, yet every time I was there was never any food. From what I witnessed, they fed him some veggies at night, but were almost always out of hay and pellets. Many times, I reminded them to feed Coco. \r  \n\r  \nCoco was hardly held, and spent hours on end in his cage. So, when I was there I would often hold him, and he would be with me for quite awhile cuddling in my arms. I was getting to the point I felt terrible leaving him. \r  \n\r  \nAfter witnessing so much neglect, I went to Fran and asked her if I could adopt Coco. I was very polite, saying that Derek has lost interest (as kids often do), but I didn\u2019t mention that I felt like she was being neglectful too as I didn\u2019t want her to think she was being personally attacked.\r  \n\r  \nA week later, Fran dropped Coco off at my place. There was no hay, pellets, or food given to me, and his cage was disgusting. Like, Coco\u2019s poop piles became hard as rock and the water bottle needed cleaning. It was gross. Anyway, I got Coco a larger cage, got him plenty of food, and even got him a companion guinea pig named Puffs (get it?). So, he\u2019s much happier and far more active now with the attention I give. \r  \n\r  \nOkay, so that\u2019s the backstory. Well, a few months after I adopted Coco, I was visiting my family. My brother was talking with me and ask me why Fran gave me the guinea pig. I mentioned the neglect and said it was \u201ckind-of a rescue\u201d since I didn\u2019t get him from a rescue shelter. My brother (who doesn\u2019t like Fran at all, but that\u2019s another story), said \u201cWhat you mean kind-of a rescue? We are talking about Fran here, it was a rescue.\u201d So, I replied, \u201cYou\u2019re right, I rescued Coco.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nSome how, word got back to Fran on what I said. She texted me several messages calling me an a\\*hole for implying she was a neglectful pet owner and a terrible person. I ignored her, but I do feel a little bad as I didn\u2019t intend to hurt her feelings. I\u2019m not longer welcome in her home.\r  \n\r  \nSo, Reddit, AITA for calling my pet Coco a \u201crescue\u201d and hurting the feelings of my friend? Several friends and family members say I\u2019m not (but they don\u2019t like Fran, so they are biased), but another friend said I shouldn\u2019t said anything, and that she\u2019s a struggling single mother and that she was simply overwhelmed.

Fran for getting a pet for her kid who isn't ready for one and then allowing Coco to be neglected.

Being open only goes as far as your own secrets.\n\nI mean, OP stated clearly that he didn't want this info to get out. The brother is certainly at fault for putting it on blast, but he wouldn't have had anything to broadcast if OP hadn't given him anything.", "NTA. Fran is just guilty she let this abuse happen without intervention because it\u2019s making her look bad.

Whenever I cut veggies they would do their crazy cute squeaking from the garden and you had to go pay a carrot tax.

Grandbaby wanted them as pets not long ago; and I had to investigate ( I literally knew nothing about their care) First thing I learned, is they are social animals, they need peers! then that it was a 5 to 7 year commitment. Feeding was shocking as well. It was a long journey learning about them, and a realization that a 5 year old would lose interest in a matter of weeks. We did end up getting them, 3 to be exact, and they are awesome little guys! Cage needs cleaning daily, but I knew that before I committed. Fran should not be allowed to own pets! She didn't do her homework. I feel like we should have a \"pet resgistry\" where neglectful owners are listed! SMH. Thank You for your rescue!!!", "In your brother's defense, if this is the first time he's blabbed- why wouldn't he blab about animal abuse? That's something fran absolutely should be on blast for. It might save somebody else down the line from trusting her to dogsit, look after their fish, etc, etc. If she didn't want anybody to think her pet needed rescuing, maybe she shouldn't have neglected it to the point of needing rescue.", "Yeah this is what pushed it over the line for me. If you wanted everyone to know Fran is a neglectful owner, fine, but be honest about it. \n\nYou knew your brother didn't like Fran. It was always likely he would use this against her. He didn't drag it out of you, you chose to tell him about the neglect.\n\nI'm really glad you rescued that poor pig and you're a good person for that. But saying one thing then acting the opposite is asshole behaviour. \n\nI'd remember this the next time you tell your brother anything. If he can gossip about Fran, he can gossip about anyone else you talk about together."]}
