I can understand why your girlfriend doesn\u2019t want to keep a stuffed owl you put your blood in, however, because I\u2019m beginning to suspect that YOU u/666truemetal666 are possessed by the owl, and the last thing I need is a possessed owl fucking up my life, NTA", "NTA. I was expecting something scarier! Oswald looks like a delightful little goober honestly. Thanks for having a silly post for this sub, sometimes it gets way too depressing and serious around here.", "I have a feeling if you try to throw Oswald out he will defy the laws of physics, space and time to appear in your new home prior to your arrival. Best to appease the gods of the new world and keep him in the family. NTA", "I was gonna say Y. T.  A....until I clicked on the picture and Oswald's mystical eyes bored into my soul... and the wall behind me. NTA. Oswald must stay", "NTA I love Oswald! Weird things are wonderful and they always tell a story. You'd 100% regret getting rid of Oswald and I think it's a strange hill to die on for your wife", "NTA \n\nHe is a little bit terrifying in a way that wouldn't appeal to many people, but I'm very much of the opinion that if something makes you happy and it's not hurting anyone else, you should be allowed that. Maybe try to come to a compromise with your wife in terms of where in your new place you could keep him where she maybe wouldn't have to see him as much but you could still love and appreciate him at your leisure.", "NTA. It doesn't matter what it looks like. It makes you happy and you've developed a personal connection to how it makes you feel. If she doesn't want to display it publicly for guests, fine... You should compromise on that. But to ask you to throw it out and be unnecessarily cruel about it is totally unwarranted.\n\nAre you able to store it some place safe? After her comment, I'm worried your wife might destroy it while you are out.", "NTA or maybe TA. I dunno I'm the kind of woman that would insist you keep your weird owl, for I have weird shit of my own and recognize that I could later use it for leverage. \n\nAll that being said I really think you should keep your weird owl. Relationships come and go, weird stuffed owls are forever (or probably a decade or two anyways, the taxidermied items in museums can be much older than that, they usually dye them and touch them up periodically though, don't know what kind of treatment your weird owl is receiving).", "I kinda love him.", "NTA.\n\nOswald terrifies me. Please keep him contained in your home so he doesn\u2019t seek out a new place to haunt.", "NTA, Oswald. Please don\u2019t smite me, Oswald. You\u2019re a good owl, Oswald.", "NTA, I like him", "NTA. \n\nThat is the weirdest, most misshapen interpretation of something vaguely resembling what an owl would look like in one\u2019s day terrors. \n\nHe\u2019s awesome, he deserves to continue watching over his future sacrifi\u2026I mean house mates.", "NTA, nah bro the owl stays.", "NTA if Ole Ozzy is just chilling, then no harm, no fowl", "*worships new dark God* NTA", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry you are shackled to an Unbeliever, but her time will come.", "I think YTA if you keep her. \n\nLet Oswald continue to defy the law of Sunk Cost Fallacy. \n\nLet Oswald continue to mesmerize you\u2026and me truth be told \n\nAnd one day, let Oswald, in all his lack of Majesty, and not some person you are connected to by a flimsy piece of paper, be the one to tell you when it\u2019s time for him to fly away.", "This is something I would do. NTA I think I love him. \n\nAbout 12 years ago one of the insurance companies had that stack of cash with eyes (somebody's watching you) ad campaign. I got a pop up one in the mail. I set him up on my entertainment center and named him Bob. Bob died by toddler hands about a year later RIP Bob", "OK wtf are Oswald\u2019s eyes made out of?!?!? \ud83e\udd23\n\nNTA but Oswald should be hidden when guests come over & I can\u2019t blame your wife if she refuses to have sex with you with Oswald in the room! Also your wife gets to paint the room Oswald resides in, any color she wants OR she can buy 1 thing that is weird or creepy or hideous or just plain embarrassing \u2026.. then proudly display it next to that creepy possessed owl.", "NTA. Any woman who tried to make you get rid of Oswald should have to hit the road. Oswald will be loyal forever.
