I've been very low contact with my dad for the past year or so. To keep it short, he was not a great dad to us or a great husband to mom. Everything always had to go his way, if we went against it he'd play the victim and go on about how he's not respected. He'd call mom really awful names. Didn't lift a finger around the house. Compared us to other kids, his siblings kids, and how they were so much better. \n\nMom put up with it because \"what would people say otherwise\" and would always say he's a great guy because he volunteered and stuff, and we had a nice home, good education, all that. Apparently this was normal in all marriages, so me and my sisters learned to live with it as well, although we all kind of knew this was toxic. I had my wake up call after incidents (I don't know how else to describe it) with my sisters. I know for some people it's easy to cut family members off, but for me it wasn't, but this is the decision I felt I had to make because I honestly have no respect for my dad (even if he's better now than before, what's done is done)\n\nI'm also kind of low contact with my mom, even though I do love her, but I can't forgive her enabling of him. \n\nMy partner and I are getting married later this year in a small ceremony. I've invited mom as a guest, but she has nothing to do with the bridal party. My partner is walking me down the aisle. Dad isn't invited.\n\nSo my mom got kind of pissed that I didn't invite dad and also that she can't give a mother of the bride speech, and I'm tearing the family apart. We argued about this and then she said if I'm going to be like this, it's best if she doesn't attend. I sort of blew up at her and said to stop being selfish for once and be there for at least one of her daughters, and she got upset/mad at me. My aunt (mom's sister) also texted me saying I'm hurting my mom even more and to be understanding.", "created_utc": 1681649000, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12o79jx/aita_for_blowing_up_at_my_mom_after_she_said_she/", "score": 198, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And your mom still says it isn\u2019t his fault. Am I reading that right? Holy shit, why do you ever speak to either of those assholes? I know it\u2019s easy to say and hard to do, but I would never be able to look either of them in the face again. NTA. Tell mom that, like dad, her presence is no longer welcome.", "NTA. After reading about your sisters, I know it\u2019s easier said than done but going NC with both of your parents sounds like it would be for the best.", "I mean... NTA for being upset with your mom , but are you sure this relationship is worth maintaining? It sounds like it doesn't benefit either of you. Your mom clearly won't accept you don't want your dad back in your life, and backing down so you can keep her would hurt you. I think it's time to go NC with her as well\n\n*Edited to add some stuff", "NTA. So reading your comment - your father actually killed your sister (who he knew had respiratory problems) by not isolating at the start of Covid and hiding his illness, causing her to get sick and die. This caused your second sister to spiral and essentially killed herself.\n\nI mean, in many countries if you have HIV and sleep with someone without disclosing and protection you can get jail time\n\nYour mother is defending that he killed his daughters.. I mean\u2026   I guess it is easier to double down that to face facts.\n\nUnderstand it is hard, since they are the only close \u201cfamily left\u201d. But what do you stand to gain from having them in your life?\n\nEdit: grammar", "NTA but be prepared for your mother to decide not to come. Inviting one spouse and not the other causes them to have to make the choice about showing support to the union or showing support to the spouse, and she doesn't want to make the decision.

All of these things just happen to involve your parents.", "NTA\n\nShe enabled your dad's crappy behaviour and is reaping the consequences of the childhood you lived through.\n\nIt's her choice whether to attend in the capacity you've invited her or to sulk because she isn't getting her picture-perfect \"unless the neighbours\" and choose not to attend \n\nYou aren't the AH for having your own boundaries about your own wedding. \n\nCongratulations on your upcoming wedding.", "You should probably have mentioned that both your sisters are deceased & why if you wanted informed judgments.", "NTA- Too many abusive men were enabled by the silence of their wives and families. You've learned what treatment you will not accept in your life. Unfortunately, no contact with your Dad may also cut you off from your Mum.

Your wedding shouldn't be an opportunity for them to start to ruin yours.", "NTA. I was erring on NAH and I only say this because your mum has clearly been in an abusive and toxic relationship and while I don\u2019t think it\u2019s on you as the child to be able to understand and process that, I think acknowledging that could lessen the resentment you have towards your mum. But at the end of the day, she was the adult and you were the child and she should\u2019ve been there for you more than she was. \n\nThat being said, you are under no obligation to continue contact with your parents and have even less of an obligation to invite them to your wedding or include them in the wedding party. You are definitely not an asshole for this. If your mum wants to not be hurt by the truth then she should have worked harder to build a better relationship with you and your siblings.", "OP, please add an edit to include what you mentioned in [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12o79jx/aita_for_blowing_up_at_my_mom_after_she_said_she/jgh7m1x/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=1&utm_term=1&context=3).\n\n\nYou had 2 siblings.

The oldest sister got help for her grief, but then later mixed alcohol with meds you shouldn't drink while taking, and went for a drive. She never made it home. Dad takes no responsibility at all.\n\nNTA. And OP, at this point I think you should accept that your mom is just as culpable as your father. She enabled him for years. I can't blame your parents for your older (adult) sister's choices, but that still leaves the high school senior who should be in college now. They can't give you back your sister, and they can't take back the choices they made that took her life. Yes, your dad was the source of the infection, but your mom has never held him accountable for anything. And still isn't, and that's not going to change.\n\nTell your aunt to back the fuck off. Ask her what she would have done or did to protect her family from Covid during 2020, and then ask her why she thinks it's acceptable that her BIL didn't do the same for his. And if she thinks what he did was fine, block her. She's no more deserving of your time than he is.\n\nI'm so sorry for all your loss, and I hope you have the happiest wedding day possible.", "Everyone needs to read OP's post with a further explanation", "It's your wedding so, technically NTA, but you should not be surprised that this is your mother's reaction.", "NTA but I think you need to stop expecting that one day your Mum is going to chose you over her husband. That's never going to happen. I had to cut my Mum off for this reason too. Sure my Mum,  like yours, was a victim of an abusive relationship. But my Mum, like yours, she enabled and helped our Dad abuse us, her kids. And now we're adults every opportunity she's had to put her kids and grandkids first, she chooses her husband, our Dad, while swearing we are her priority.\n\n\nI'm sorry but your Mum is never changing and it's probably for the best she doesn't attend your wedding.", "NTA.

Your dad especially is a deeply horrible man, your mother is an enabler of the worst kind, and I don't mean to armchair diagnose your father but he seems to have some kind of personality disorder (narcissism, sociopathy I'm not sure of the exact words).

I understand with them being the main part of your family left that it is hard to completely cut them both off. You may want to sometime though.

Hugs to you, I am so sorry for your losses.", "NTA but in your shoes, I probably wouldn't have invited my mom because I feel like her reaction to not having your dad there and not doing thr happy mother of the bride things was predictable.\n\nShe may have chosen to forgive your dad for his negligence which directly caused the death of one sister and indirectly caused the death of the other.
