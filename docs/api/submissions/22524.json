Is that truly how it appears on deeds? Couldn't someone fence in their yard?", "**INFO:** Are you sure the city actually owns those first few feet? Is it possible they just have an easement for specific purposes?", "YTA\n\nWhere there are laws that state certain parts of a \"yard\" are considered city property, the adjacent property is generally required to maintain that space despite not technically owning it.

It's not **your** property.\n\nKeep your pet's piss and shit on *your* property.", "YTA. It may be technically city property so they can deal with repair issues to infrastructure but it\u2019s still their yard that they have to upkeep. No one who is pet free wants to deal with dog shit smell or residue in their yard.", "YTA I myself am a dog owner, just respect the no pooping signs it\u2019s really not that difficult", "As long as you continue cleaning up after your dog, you are NTA \n\nI live a long way from a park. People walk by with their dogs all the time. I do sometimes wait to see if someone cleans up and they always do. That\u2019s the only thing that matters", "ESH. While she doesn't \"own\" those few feet, she is in charge of caring for it and for all intents and purposes it is in fact her yard. You should try to direct the dog to a yard that doesn't have such signs. It won't always work, but you can try to be polite.", "YTA. \n\nThis is the pathetic adult man version of \"not touching you!\" as you hover over someone. \n\nIf it looks bad, it reflects badly on her, even if it is city property, so she has a vested interest in keeping it presentable. dog poo and pee is not good for grass, so her position is understandable. Also, you really think she wants to smell your dogshit? wake up every morning and see something taking a dump in her front yard?", "Omg, it was a stupid argument and you caused it. Of course, technically, it's the city's, but she mows it and waters it and cares for it, and does not want your dog shitting on it. Or worse, peeing brown holes into the grass. Let it do its business on your own effing lawn if you're too lazy to walk the dog to the park. YTA", "YTA, she may not own it, but she is responsible for keeping it clean. She also has a sign. The fact that you clean doesn't change there is a sign explicitly telling no dogs there. Is it that difficult to pass the yards with signs? Also, dogs piss as well and it can kill grass, why should she bother to to plant grass coz of you ignoring the sign?\n\nWe have a dog, we live in a city with the closest part 30mins away by public transport, we walk around the neighborhood but never let our dog wonder anywhere where the sign is. It's besic human decency.\n\nAnd yeah, I know most signs aren't legally binding, but people have their right to express their wants. And this woman doesn't want your dog, their poop or piss on the grass she has to keep up, although not owning completely", "YTA\n\nThe city doesn't own that land, its just an easement.  And you're flagrantly disregarding the signs asking you to not let your dog shit in someone's yard.", "YTA and I really don\u2019t think you understand what easements are.", "If your best reasoning for why something is okay is that it\u2019s legal, pretty good bet YTA", "YTA. Unless you're scrubbing every speck of dog shit off the grass, you're leaving a mess for someone to step in .  Just picking up the chunks isn't cleaning it up. It's disgusting.   \n\n\nEdit.. the homeowner is usually responsible for mowing that area, keeping it clean/green etc. So 'city property' isn't an out.", "YTA. How do you even know exactly where each person\u2019s property begins and ends? I would expect the homeowner to know where their yard begins.", "YTA regardless of whether the city has some claim on the property.

I own all the way to the street I hate having other people's dogs shit in my yard too. Shit in your own yard", "YTA.  This is why many cities are so draconian in their dog and leash rules, entitled people like you.  Also, who told you that isn't her property?  Where did you get the info that the city owns it?", "[deleted]", "YTA even if the first few feet aren\u2019t technically there\u2019s it\u2019s their garden and they have a right to be annoyed even if you pick it up all the germs and everything will still be there. It seems like you got your dog into a bad habit because if your dog needs a poo it either needs to be at your own place or not on someone\u2019s yard. The first few feet rule is stupid like it\u2019s still their yard. Do it on the sidewalk or something", "YTA\n\nWait for your dog to poop in your yard before you start out for the park. It's not that hard.", "Gives the same vibes as the woman that walks her dog up and down my suburb letting him terrorise every other dog and mark everything because \u201che\u2019s just saying hi\u201d\n\nYTA. just.. avoid the ones with signs.", "You are totally the asshole. Jeez.", "YTA because of the sign but literally last week someone posted & was NTA because of how hard it is to stop a dog who\u2019s already pooping", "NTA if it is city property.

Now, maybe don\u2019t go out of your way to have your dog poop in that specific yard. But that\u2019s it.", " NTa, the city does own those few feet of space. Your dog can shit and piss where ever they like if you are cleaning up after them.", "NTA but maybe walk your dog around your yard u til he poops then go on your walk", "YTA.", "Where I live, that section of grass is owned by the property owner, not the city.  \n\nWhat makes YTA is the part where you let your dog poop in sections where there are signs posted prohibiting it. \n\nI don't care if someone let's their dog poop on there as long as they clean it up, but you should respect people's boundaries like that when there is a sign posted.", "ESH this lady didn't need to threaten to call the police, but it's still rude to let your dog poop there if there's a no pooping sign. While it technically may be the councils property, they aren't the ones who use it, maintain it, and have to put up with damage from dogs doing their business. If this was genuinely an accident and you couldn't redirect your dog, I'd go N T A, but because you let it happen, deliberately ignored the sign, and made the whole interaction into a argument based on a technicality, you are also in the wrong.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I have that area in my front yard and there are no parks near me. I expect and know dog-owners use it. Where are dogs supposed to go if not in those areas?

Typically owners of the adjacent property are responsible for maintaining the space despite not technically owning it.\n\nShoveling snow off the sidewalk is a classic example of this.
