We were friends until puberty hit. She fit the beauty standard in our culture(light skin, shiny straight hair) & while I wasn't ugly (I was a child), hearing her get endlessly praised & getting crickets about how I looked definitely impacted me.   \nThen, as we got to high school, she'd be invited along with the older college-aged cousins to hang out. She\u2019d make snide comments about how they didn't think I was mature enough to hang with them & ignore me.  \nFast forward to 2023. I got a job & moved out of state, while she moved back in with her parents. I came back for Christmas & \\*unknowingly!\\* asked her if she had any good investment tips, just to make conversation b/c she worked in finance. She gave me a death stare & my mom pulled me aside to tell me that Sara lost 300K in crypto & it was a sore topic. (I had no idea about this.)  \nI apologized to her in private later & she got even sniffier, which is fair, if I lost that much money I'd be irritable too.  \nLater, me, her, & the older kids hung out & it was the first time they\u2019d ever invited me too.   \nWhile talking abt work(I work in tech)she kept cutting me off to interject her knowledge about the tech industry. I didn\u2019t think much of it b/c she\u2019d had a couple hits off a w\\*ed pen & thought she was just zooted.  \nBut later, while I was recounting a date I\u2019d been on & how the dude had asked to go 50-50, she started bragging about how her boyfriend Sam(30M) bought her a condo. I congratulated her & the conversation continued.   \nThen, while trying to hype our other cousin I said, \u201cTalia, you\u2019re a gorgeous doctor, it\u2019s his loss\u201d to which Sara cut me off with \u201cNot everyone gets their self-worth from how much money they make Overall\\_Book1562!\u201d super rudely. I was taken aback & said that she\u2019s the one that's always bringing up money in the first place. She got angry & proclaimed her commitment to taking care of her parents & prioritizing building a family while I apparently moved away to be a \u201cboss babe\u201d.  \nI had enough & said the only reason she\u2019s living at home is b/c she lost \u00bd a million & is a spendthrift who has no concept of money & at least I didn\u2019t drain my parents' life savings.   \nMy other cousins were signaling me to STFU, which made me angrier as I remembered how they\u2019d excluded me when I was younger. So I said that she\u2019s only given chances b/c she\u2019s pretty enough to be a trophy wife & then she snapped that Sam makes my annual income monthly(there\u2019s no way). She stormed away crying then to another room & all my cousins followed her while I hid in the bathroom.  \nOn the way home, my mom said Sara told everyone the things I\u2019d said & both my parents got mad at me without giving me the chance to explain.   \nI don\u2019t think I said anything too out of line, considering Sara was negging me the entire time. Our entire extended family will obviously paint her as the beautiful victim no doubt, so I really don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with me being angry about it.
