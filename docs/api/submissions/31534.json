It kind of sounds like your sister is a spoiled brat who at some point realized claiming her personal desires were autism related was an easy way to get what she wants.

Yes there are some instances where an autistic person needs may need to be prioritized. My nephew, for example, doesn't handle strangers crowding or touching him.
