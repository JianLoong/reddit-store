My (47F) stepdaughter (17F) recently had some changes that resulted in her getting back into contact with us. SD lives 2.5 hours away in a rural town that's only accessible by car. She previously lived with her mother, but a lot of things happened and her mother and stepfather moved across the country and left her there alone. She had run away prior to this (abuse and extreme neglect allegedly) and was living on a friend's couch, but her mother was served a foreclosure notice and was hounded by CPS, so they packed up everything except SD and left. \n\nObviously, my husband and I got involved again. She will  live with us after she graduates. We have been up once to see her in December and had her spend Christmas with us. \n\nThe crux of the issue between all of us is that SD wants a phone. Her father and I agreed that she should have one. Her mother was too poor to ever buy her one and all they had was a house phone that her step father usually had unplugged. When she was younger (we had her from ages 7 to 13) she had a horrible tendency to accidentally break/lose things and she does not have a job or anything. My husband left getting the phone up to me, so I went with one of those military grade flip phones. It was actually one of my husband's old phones, but it was perfect for her bad habits. \n\nShe was disappointed. At first she wasn't vocally disappointed, but I guess she's having trouble with T9 texting and is upset that the phone doesn't have a camera or data or anything. She didn't have a phone before, so I don't know how she can be missing something she never had. She asked for a tablet with a camera for Christmas, but she needed clothes and whatnot and we also instead gave the people she's staying with grocery gift cards and told her maybe next year.\n\nShe's very angry about this, even though she's never had a phone before. My husband says that it was sort of an assholeish move. I don't agree.

You say, \"I don't know how she can be missing something she never had.\" She goes to school. She has classmates. Given current trends, they very likely all have smart phones. It is very easy for her to see that what she has does not equal what they have, and as a teenager, she would likely resent it. Instead of being able to fit in, she gets a hand-me-down boomer phone. Instead of trusting her with something valuable, you said she couldn't handle it. If you had considered all of these feelings and still had reasons for buying her that phone, I would say NTA, but I think you're just unaware of how receiving that phone would make her feel. \n\nAlso, in parent language, \"Maybe next year,\" is a \"No.\"", "So you live in a \u201cvery affluent\u201d suburb and you didn\u2019t even buy her a smart phone?

Your stepdaughter was living in an abusive situation, and your husband did nothing about that? He wasn't able to keep regular contact for years because of lack of phone service, and didn't drag his ex back into court to force that to get fixed? SD was literally abandoned by her custodial parent? After running away before that and is now couch surfing?\n\nAnd you're on here asking about a *flip phone*?\n\nHoly shit do you and your husband have problems.\n\nYour stepdaughter needs more than clothes and a phone, she needs a fucking parent. Which you are not, seeing as you live 2.5 hours away and can't seem to be bothered with regular contact. And the family that's actually raising her at the moment doesn't need grocery cards, they need child support.\n\nYTA.", "I was prepared to say NTA, cause don't look a gift horse in the mouth.\n\nBUT from reading your text, I get the sense you're treating her poorly - not like a legitimate member of you and your husband's family.

It sounds like you guys have basically half abandoned her and give her scraps demanding she be grateful.", "YTA. \n\nLet me get this straight: you\u2019re pissed that your legally homeless stepdaughter didn\u2019t fawn at your feet when you gave her a 15+ year old phone because she used to lose and break things as a 10 year old. Stepdaughter is still living in a precarious situation, attending a high school with questionable academic standards that will not serve her well but that\u2019s okay because she\u2019ll graduate on time and be able to get a job. You have the ability to take her in but don\u2019t want to because she would have to take extra math courses and would graduate later than you think is acceptable. \n\nDid she murder your grandmother or something?

Emergency (if you are out of service or even credit then you can still call emergency services. \n\n3. Communication (mental health staying in contact with their friends/ contact with employer/ contact with her dad and you). A smart phone can access the internet and she can send free messages if she has no credit, and nearly all shops have free wifi these days. \n\n4. Direction (you want her to move to a new town and she can get lost easily).\n\nYou are doing the bare minimum and sound typical evil step mother. \n\nIs her father providing money to her friends family for keeping her? Providing for her uniforms/ books/ etc? Food allowance? Are you paying for phone credit? \n\nSeriously you both are the A H (you and dad). You left her in an abusive situation and sound put off by having to deal with her. You haven\u2019t had to deal with any responsibility and are still failing. Wow.

From the title, I was expecting a tantrum over an iPhone 13 instead of a 15 or something.\n\nJesus, just buy her a smart phone like normal parents. Forcing your stepdaughter to use a handme down flip phone is like evil stepmother for the modern age shit.", "INFO: have you been sending birthday and Christmas presents to her regularly since she moved back to her mum's?\n\nI get the impression that you basically wrote her off when she moved back to her mother's house. You judge a near adult by a child's actions when she used to live with you. I really hope her graduation present is an iPhone 15 with all the trimmings. You know that phone is going to stigmatize her the moment she arrives in your affluent neighborhood. \n\nBe a better step-parent and stop dominating your husband who at least seems to love his daughter.\n\nEdit: YTA", "YTA. Poor thing is going from an abusive household to one where she is clearly not wanted.", "YTA holy shit you\u2019re the stepmonster", "YTA.\n\nI completely agree that most teens do NOT need the latest model of electronics. But to give a teenager the kind of phone my 80 year-old grandma uses? C\u2019mon, that\u2019s ridiculous. Sure, she can make phone calls and text (once she gets used to technology that\u2019s been outdated since she was a baby). But her friends very likely have something less archaic and are making fun of her. Plus, the message you sent here was that she is only worth your leftovers.", "YTA\n\nI understand giving like a 13 year old or younger a flip phone that can't break, but this girl is 17! She's at an age where she should be socializing with her peers and learning how to fit into society to become independent.\n\nWe grew up in an age where there were no cellphones till maybe university age, but she did not. How do you expect this girl to make friends, not get bullied, keep in contact with classmates for group projects, search for jobs, and not get bullied? \n\nAre you trying to make this essentially homeless girl a social outcast? Do you want her to live with you forever? You need to give her the tools to become successful in life and have a chance to become an independent functioning adult.\n\nI'm not saying buy her the newest flagship iphone, but you can easily get her a cheap android smartphone. It's enough to meet her needs. If she wants anything better than that, she can work and get herself a better phone.", "YTA. She lost and broke things 4 years ago.

You obviously just don\u2019t want to spend money on her.", "YTA. Just admit that you don't like this girl. You are giving her leftovers from her dad old phone. Come on do you think a 17 year old wants a flip phone? Duh she used to break things when she was younger. She's 17 now. I hope she has a better chance at life when she goes on her own because with you she will not. Her dad needs to wake up And see how you are treating his daughter. All adults have failed this kid.", "Yta,  her behaviour at ages 7-13 is not relevant here", "Your stepdaughter is already at a huge disadvantage in life, has had very little stability, so few adults that make her feel accepted and safe. You giving her that phone says you\u2019ll do the bare minimum but you won\u2019t do it with love or caring.

She's staying with friends, you gave part of her Christmas present to the people she's staying with, aren't providing for her on a daily basis, and her Christmas present that she did was a bunch of clothes.

Get her a decent cell phone and start treating her like a member of your family (she is), not some annoying kid.", "I just want to scoop up this little pumpkin and get her some stability. First stop we go shopping to get clothes and shoes, and toss the crap that makes her look like a Le Miz extra and some cool stuff from one of those name brand makeup stores. And undergarments!  A series of appointments with my friend the most excellent trauma therapist. It should be evident why. Yes she can have a decent cell phone and a tablet so she can communicate and do her freaking homework. With that level of neglect heaven knows she may need a tutor. And that my friends is what I would do if I were her fairy godmother.", "Did you give her an old phone that you had laying around the house because you couldn\u2019t afford a smart phone? Did she do something that caused you not to want her to have access to social media?

So it is better than nothing, but not much.", "A smart phone is a mini computer the majority of us carry these days. She\u2019s not a boomer who wants it to call cousin Mildred, she\u2019s a teenager who would like to surf the internet, check the weather, listen to music, the list goes on. You gave her a flip phone. Good lord, woman, I myself haven\u2019t had one of those for at least 10 years and I\u2019m 60!

Do you want her to dislike you? \n\nFist, se wants the kind of phone other kids get age have and as you said \u201cshe\u2019s never had a new phone before\u201d, she was excited to get something new and special for her. Second, parents should provide clothes for their kids. This girl wanted the fun joys a normal teen has since she had a crappy mom who abandoned her and here you have the chance to win her over and bring her joy but you decided to be the evil stepmom by giving her an old man hand me down phone, and new clothes and grocery gift cards followed up by \u201cmaybe next year\u201d, despite the acknowledgment that you and your husband can afford the gifts she wanted. It seems like your stepdaughter has experienced her fair share of disappointment from the adults in her life and you wanted to just add to that \n\nYou also talked about how she shouldn\u2019t have a nice phone because she likely won\u2019t respect it ( I can\u2019t remember your exact words) maybe she hasn\u2019t had much nice stuff to care for before? You could have been the fun step mom and taken her to pick a few n case and stuff but you clearly just want to be another adult sucking joy from her life. \n\nSince I\u2019ve seen the replies from you and can see how dense you are and it\u2019s pretty clear you don\u2019t want to hear anything about how wrong you are, I hope her dad will fix your mistake and get her the phone she wants and not put you in charge of gifting anymore since you\u2019re incapable. \n\nGod I hope next Christmas he gives you one of his old phones and a grocery store gift card, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll love it as much as your SD.", "You could have used her dads money to get her a phone.

The phone thing aside, this girl has been massively neglected by you both - you can give all the excuses you want because ignorance is bliss right?

Good news though, you have the chance to make it up to her, show her that\u2019s she\u2019s important and take care of her - have a heart and maybe even give her a gift that isn\u2019t a need but a want. At this point, you have to ask yourself if you want to be a loving empathetic and good human being or not. And no, merely taking her in and doing the bare minimum is NOT being a good human being. You can afford it so why dont you have any compassion for this poor girl - why can\u2019t you just get her something that makes her a little bit happier so she can have a shred of joy in her life.

It sounds like her dad is not regularly providing for her (as in sending her money to live) and you gave her an old obsolete phone because she broke things as a young child.

And no- not because she broke some things when she was what? In the 1st grade? A LITTLE kid? \nThat's just the crappy excuse you came up with real quick because you don't want to bother 'wasting' money on a child that isn't yours and that you don't like. \n\nYou don't have to fake it.

Someone actually decides he's worth while and she isn't. \nThen she has to suck up the awkward feeling of invading and living off of a nice friends parents because her ACTUAL parents can't get over themselves. Getting bad grades because she's living in a situation that most adults would hate, much less a child with a non fully functioning brain.\n\nInstead of a grain of understanding, empathy, or even love. She is told to deal with it, told food is a gift, to get over it and get a job, that she isn't good enough for you or your neighborhood, and that a ghetto hand me down flip phone that hasn't been used since she was a toddler is an absolute treasure and she should be grateful\n\n\nNo. She should be angry.

She could go to the better school and just do a credit recovery class (most high schools offer this).  \n\nSecond, teens use their phones for a ton of things, not just calling and texting.   Giving her an old phone that isn\u2019t really useful for a teen is BS.  I often wish all teens only had flip phones in school, but her ability to use that phone outside of school for so much more is my main focus.  In her situation she could potentially do much better with a phone or tablet with internet access.  She could research her school work better, feel better connected to her peers and over all it could help potential make her feel better.  \n\nThird, she needs therapy, she has been through hell and you and your husband have clearly not been supportive, neither has her mother.   I am sure the school has begged for an adult to take responsibility but in these cases it often falls on deaf ears.   \n\nFourth, if she needs to repeat senior year would it suck? Sure.

She could call and text you (I'm surprised the phone works because most don't work with 2g and it's been phased out among with the towers). I read a comment about her needing to get a job at some point, which she could use her phone to fill out applications. A smart phone is incredibly versatile. \n\nYou dismiss the bullying that happened to her in your area. Which you're so dismissive and never reach out, no wonder she didn't tell you about the abuse she was enduring at home. You say money isn't an issue, but getting her tutors and caught up to be able to have a better life is not something you're interested in. \n\nIt seems like you look down on those who aren't as \"affluent\" as you.

My (47F) stepdaughter (17F) recently had some changes that resulted in her getting back into contact with us. SD lives 2.5 hours away in a rural town that's only accessible by car. She previously lived with her mother, but a lot of things happened and her mother and stepfather moved across the country and left her there alone. She had run away prior to this (abuse and extreme neglect allegedly) and was living on a friend's couch, but her mother was served a foreclosure notice and was hounded by CPS, so they packed up everything except SD and left. \n\nObviously, my husband and I got involved again. She will  live with us after she graduates. We have been up once to see her in December and had her spend Christmas with us. \n\nThe crux of the issue between all of us is that SD wants a phone. Her father and I agreed that she should have one. Her mother was too poor to ever buy her one and all they had was a house phone that her step father usually had unplugged. When she was younger (we had her from ages 7 to 13) she had a horrible tendency to accidentally break/lose things and she does not have a job or anything. My husband left getting the phone up to me, so I went with one of those military grade flip phones. It was actually one of my husband's old phones, but it was perfect for her bad habits. \n\nShe was disappointed. At first she wasn't vocally disappointed, but I guess she's having trouble with T9 texting and is upset that the phone doesn't have a camera or data or anything. She didn't have a phone before, so I don't know how she can be missing something she never had. She asked for a tablet with a camera for Christmas, but she needed clothes and whatnot and we also instead gave the people she's staying with grocery gift cards and told her maybe next year.\n\nShe's very angry about this, even though she's never had a phone before. My husband says that it was sort of an assholeish move. I don't agree. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "Also her excuse is that she used to break things 5-10 years ago when she was much smaller?

Buy the poor kid a decent phone.", "so you're just here to argue with people?", "I'll clarify first that I'm personally a big fan of flip phones. I just personally like them for myself, and I think that when it comes to giving kids phones it's a good typical first step (people have a tendency to give their kids smart phones way to early. But sometimes it can be helpful to give your somewhat younger kid a phone so they can contact you, and flip phone are good because they serve that purpose but not too much else). \n\nHowever, she's seventeen. She's almost an adult, she isn't a kid who shouldn't have access to anything else. She's at an age where she's allowed on pretty much all social media sites without having to lie or use the toned down version. She's at an age where she should be able to make decisions for herself regarding other types of online activities as well. Things like being able to watch videos can also be beneficial, and while that is technically possible on flip phones... It's neither easy nor good quality. I bring up videos because that can both be a fun passing the time thing, but can also be a school thing. There's also music, listening to music can be really helpful for various reasons and that's not always the easiest on flip phones either. Which, is something that I think is fine if it's a choice, but, in this instance that's not a choice. She doesn't have to have a flip phone, there are affordable smart phones that exist that she could have gotten (and she mentioned a tablet with a camera too right?)\n\nDirectly regarding \"all she needs it for\"; that's something that really depends. Does she have friends? Or is there a hope she will make some even if she doesn't have any rn? Because being able to text and call is helpful, but frankly is not always that helpful when it comes to communicating with friends. I know more people who I communicate with via other means than I do people I actually truly use the phone for. I only really text and call when it comes to my family members and like doctors visits. Everything else I do is email (which, admittedly is a bit easier to access on a flip phone in comparison to the next thing) and social media or discord. I have friends who I only have the ability to contact via Instagram, friends who will only respond if I message them on discord. I'm not even that big on Instagram but I have one specifically for the purpose of communicating with friends and classmates. The formatting for lots of sites isn't the best on a flip phone, would be very janky, and that's if you manage to get it to work on there in general (can depend on the phone and data plans)\n\n\nThere's of course always the argument that those things could be accessed at home somehow. If I recall correctly, you didn't get her the tablet? Does she have computer access? Does she have any devices of her own besides the flip phone? Even with at home access that can be kind of shitty for a teen (especially in the modern day, where there's quite a few options). It doesn't feel good not being able to have your own things that you can access on your own time, having to schedule times to just like, be able to talk to people, frankly sucks. Having a smart phone can be a good remedy because it's a personal device that she could use on her own accord, and is also portable, and well, it's nice to be able to talk to friends or look things up on the go. \n\nAnd yes there's some things technically possible on flip phones, and some things that aren't always unavoidable. But in this situation they can be avoidable. There's a big difference between using the bit more difficult or annoying option when you have to, and being forced to use it because people are making you.", "Wow.

And no mention of seeing her in January or February, just the December and Christmas visits... that doesn't alarm you that a child is abandoned by one parent and blown off by another?", "No it is, a lot of things this day envolve dowloading some stupid app, like bank, making doctors appoiment & etc.", "I don\u2019t see a problem in wanting to at least feel just a tiny bit like a normal kid", "\"She's not eating out of trash cans anymore, so it's not that bad.\" Do you even hear yourself?", "From the way you speak, you had money for both. You made an active choice to be TA. Where is her dad in all of this?", ".... does anyone who has a responsibility to this child actually care about her at all? You're not a monster for thinking clothing outweighs needing a tablet, you're a monster because you and your husband, *this child's father* have done less than the absolute minimum for her.", "Um, why didn't you get her BOTH? Clothes are essentials but you consider them a Christmas present?  This poor kid really does know that she nobody wants her", "Why they hell didn\u2019t your husband fight for custody of his daughter if that is the way she was living?", "Omfg what you\u2019re describing is a traumatic and abusive environment and instead of empathy you\u2019re treating her as ungrateful. Get that kid whatever the eff she wants, she\u2019s been through the ringer, she wants to feel like a normal teen opening a smart phone and tablet instead of necessities because it sounds like she hast had the joy of opening the special normal gifts on Christmas. \n\nPush for her getting a job when she has a permanent address and some therapy. You\u2019re wild OP. \n\nDoes anyone actually like this child? Mom clearly didn\u2019t, it\u2019s obvious with how you talk about her that you don\u2019t and it doesn\u2019t sound like dad does either since he\u2019s putting up with you treating his kid like an ungrateful brat when she\u2019s literally just been through a horrific and traumatic home life situation. You\u2019re out of touch.", "Sounds like your husband is a deadbeat if he was cool with her living like that. Where were you guys while she was locked in a room and forced to eat trash? What was being done by you to try to get her out of that situation asap?", "Yes you are a monster for continuing to mentally abuse her!!  \n\nShe has asked you for 2 things and both times you have chosen to either ignore her.\n\nYou give her an old flip phone knowing full well that that not what anyone wants.  Have you actually tried texting on a flip phone?  What kind of phone do you and her father have (I bet its not a flip phone).\n\nShe asks for a tablet mentioning specifically with a camera and what does the evil stepmom do\u2026 gets her some clothes that she probably doesn't actually need or want (based on your previous comments that she\u2019s only \u201ctechnically homeless\u201d) and gives part of her christmas present to the people she is staying with in the form of grocery cards.\n\nDespite all the excuses you keep telling yourself and everyone else to justify the fact that you and your husband have failed your stepdaughter/his daughter it is clear that you do not like her and are determined to convince her that she is worthless.\n\nYou are both evil and total a\\*\\*holes.\n\n**YTA YTA YTA YTA YTA**", "ok so why the fuck are you not helping her with the massive trauma you're clearly aware of?", "This is vile. How can you be this heartless?", "Six months of ongoing instability. Got it. That's acceptable for you. What mental health resources are available in her rural area? Can she access telehealth with your flip phone? Do they have resources to work through the childhood trauma she is actively experiencing?", "so you neglected her for years, allowed her to be bullied, abused, abandoned, and *literally* homeless, while downplaying everything she's going through....\n\nbut oh, for christmas for her, you got groceries for the people who are actually taking care of her right now, and that makes everything else fine! /s\n\ncome on. how is that even justifiable? the phone is a symptom of a larger problem, where you clearly don't think very highly of her. every single time you have the chance, you imply she's just not trying hard enough, or that she's not trustworthy. no wonder she didn't want to be around you! \n\ni fully expect her to stop speaking to you in the next two years, at most.", "And interestingly enough...having lived in both school districts...I thought it was obvious. Plus their daughter graduated in 2 months. If a friend\u2019s parents are willing to take her in for a few months...why not let her graduate with friends before taking her away. Yes states set standards but schools can manipulate things to work in their favor.", "She\u2019d need a smart phone for that, but her step mom is an AH\u2026", "A flip phone runs out of credits? What?!?! Oh you think they got her one of those cheap flip phones that uses the card from Wally World. Ya know I have friends with teens and their kids have those phones. It\u2019s crazy bc they use them as a phone. And just for reference the older flip phones actually have better reception than a touch screen.", "Life lessons here to be both taught and learned. \n\nStepdaughter learns now that she can't have everything she wants and has to work hard and earn it humbly. \n\nOR....let's hand her anything just cause she had it rough. Very shortsighted and a good reason so many adults are up to their proverbial assholes in credit card debt.", "She needs a therapist but OP who says she is debt free in a wealthy area has excuses for not providing that too.  Money isn't an issue for the phone when asked.", "You're points are valid. But you're forgetting the request for tablet at Christmas with a camera. But she got clothes that she NEEDED. The camera worries me because she might be doing something she shouldn't. I think OP needs to forget about graduation and get that girl now.", "Or a tablet... same AH.", "Yup, the new way of parenting is dumb. They're your kids not your friends, treat like life lessons and everything that you learnt instead of giving them everything as they'll be entitled and learn quickly that the real world doesn't put up with that kind of stuff", "The absolute horror of wanting a camera when your entire home and life fell apart. She didn't get one, so its irrelevant that she asked for it. She wants to be a normal kid and only her friend's parents seem to be attempting to offer it. Its heart breaking. Graduation is such a minor concern, as you point out, when the kid can't work without an address. The trauma of this is going to ripple forever in her life.", "Op definitely isn\u2019t wrong for thinking clothes are more important than a tablet because they are. However, where Op and especially her husband are wrong is by not doing anything to get her in a more stable situation and waiting for her to graduate to do so and then expect her to act extremely grateful when in all reality they\u2019re barely even doing the bare minimum. And considering these times her husband\u2019s daughter probably wants to feel like she fits in\nEdit: actually I\u2019m not even sure they\u2019re even doing the bare minimum", "I don't really think she wants the camera for anything bad, to tell the truth. Last year she was very excited about her school adding a photoshop/digital photography class and I think she might've gotten into it there. She's always trying to show us pictures she's edited of landscapes and water, etc. It's just unnecessary.", "You're a beacon of hope", "New post I just made. She wants that camera for somebody on the internet and needs to be rescued NOW.", "Also Op\u2019s husband should\u2019ve brought her home before but not because she wanted a tablet with a camera", "You don\u2019t think a girl that has been through hell and abandoned deserves things that aren\u2019t explicitly necessary? Do you *want* her to hate you? How is your heart not breaking for this girl? YTA.", "Unnecessary to indulge an abused and abandoned child to have some sense of normalcy. You won't provide a loving, stable home, won't supply very necessary resources. Have you seen her since December?", "So you're not even interested in providing her the tools for interests that could turn into a career? You are really making yourself look bad here", "Hmm.  She could have a talent for that kind of work. But maybe that's not the job you had in mind?", "Then get her a phone with a camera! My daughter has a high school photography class - and she uses her phone.", "Thinking more I am VERY worried about the camera."]}
