Flying out was great, the other person in my row was cool and we shared the middle seat and snacks and played pokemon on our switches and visited each other's animal crossing islands.\n\nFlying home was where things became a bit more problematic.\n\nI was settled into my pair of seats, and a gentleman tried to sit his daughter (\\~12, not a waif, nor was her overweight dad) in my middle seat, where my bum is taking up a good third of the middle seat. I said politely, \"I'm sorry, that seat is booked. Your daughter can't sit there,\" while putting my hand on the other 2/3s of the seat.\n\nHe immediately complained that he hadn't been able to book seats together and he needed to sit with his daughter. I shrugged and said I was sorry, but it wasn't my problem, that wasn't his seat.\n\nHe called over a stewardess to complain, I explained my situation and showed my pair of tickets, and the flight attendant offered to comp my extra seat. I said no thank you, I needed the extra room and waved to where my bum was partway into the middle seat.\n\nThe stewardess came back ten minutes later with a wife from a couple who agreed to switch seats so the man could sit with his daughter. But not without attempting to shame me for not be willing to help out a dad in need and commenting about how selfish I was.\n\nI said, \"I booked early, and I booked two seats together because to put it plainly, I'm fat. His two seats were separate seats. How exactly do you propose I split my fat ass in half to sit one half in one seat and the other half in his other seat?\"\n\nThe woman turned red in the face and bitched at me for being \"disgusting\", I replied that his lack of planning was not my emergency, and she scowled at me for the entire rest of the flight. When I told my folks about it after I landed, my dad thought it was the funniest thing he'd ever heard, but my mom yelled at him for encouraging him and said I should have been more willing to help out a dad with a kid when I had two seats.\n\nSo I want to know, AITA?", "created_utc": 1669497551, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z5i9c9/aita_for_refusing_to_give_up_my_seats_and_being/", "score": 1812, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And you spent a lot of extra money to do so, I'm sure several hundred dollars overall.\n\nHe asked, and even though your were offered reimbursement, you declined, as is your right.

Good on you for booking an extra seat both for yours and the other persons comfort. I wish you good luck in your health journey. You", "NTA. In the WHOOOOLE PLANE, there wasn't a single other person willing to swap seats? I'd have been tempted to let her sit there and just squish her personally.  And she's 12ish? I bet she'd have been happy to sit away from Dad and text her friends and not have him looking over her shoulder.  Congrats on the weight loss!!!!", "NTA. You started politely assertive.

Maybe the stewardess should've treated you with the same consideration she did the father.", "NOPE, NTA.\n\nIn zero way we're you in the wrong. Besides that, it's a small space. You don't NEED to sit next to anyone on the plane.

I applaud you got standing your ground!", "NTA", "NTA and you're fucking hilarious, I agree with your dad", "You are absolutely NTA. You paid for those seats. He could have booked two seats together and paid for them too, he just chose not to. If you had given up the seat he'd be bitching about how dare you be fat in \"his daughter's seat\".

Congratulations on your journey.", "NTA.  You bought two seats, you were entitled to those two seats, regardless of your weight.  Had you been bone thin and still bought two seats (for whatever reason, such as not wanting to sit next to horribly entitled people), you STILL would not be an asshole.

You had every right.", "NTA and thank you, you seem super cool about the situation. We need more people,like you. \n\nAll the best on your new health journey!", "NTA.  As you said, you cannot separate a portion of your ass to sit elsewhere. Airlines make it impossible for plus sized people to fit in an individual seat, and some even require you book two.  If the father needed to sit with his daughter, he should have discussed that with the gate attendants beforehand so they could find a passenger willing to give ip their seat.  None of this was your responsibility.  And you should complain to the airline about the flight attendant fat shaming you.", "nta you bought two seats because you are using two seats.", "NTA", "NTA    you booked a second seat because you didn't want another passenger to be uncomfortable, that shows you are compassionate.

Thank you for your consideration and forward thinking \ud83d\ude0a", "NTA, at all!  You planned ahead to ensure that your flight would be comfortable and relaxing.  Airline seats are narrow and tightly packed, so you planned it out, perfectly.  You were under no obligation to give up the seat, and you pointed out exactly the reasons you could not.  That man should have planned to get two seats together, and gotten there early enough to secure the seating.  That is a him problem.", "Nta.

Even if you had let them sit there, who\u2019s to say they wouldn\u2019t have complained about space. You went well above and beyond to make sure the seat was yours, and you\u2019re right, although a bit crass, it\u2019s not your problem.", "NTA.

You're a person with agency and you used that agency to purchase two tickets, and they had no right to deny your agency or shame you for using it to insist on being treated the same as anyone else would wish to be treated were they in your situation. You are owed an apology by both the airline and the individuals involved here, and I hope you get one. \n\nIn case you don't I would like to apologize on behalf of society for treating you this way. I personally made some fatphobic comments and mistakes in my past, but I like to think that I've been educated on the issue since then. I hope these folks have the same experience I did and they learn that fatphobia is wrong and hurts all of us.\n\nNTA\n\nNTA in the slightest.", "Nta. You were correct.", "NTA. People need to understand that they aren\u2019t entitled to someone else\u2019s seat. I think it\u2019s fine to ask to change seats but if the person says no, then they need to accept that. You absolutely should have and have the right to stand your ground, you paid for those seats, not them.\n\nI commend you for buying two seats to ensure you and whoever is next to you are both comfortable. I\u2019m quite a small person and I always try to lean as far away from people as possible to give them space when I\u2019m in an aisle or window seat but I\u2018ve definitely been on flights where I\u2019m stuck touching someone the entire time no matter how hard I try.

I appreciate you.", "Dear Lord, NTA. Would it have killed the 12 year old and the dad to sit apart for a few hours?

File a complaint with the airline, and make it clear that you **paid** for that second seat and the stewardess was being insulting about it. As you said, you planned ahead, the dad's emergency was not your emergency, and the stewardess had no business gaslighting or manipulating you into feeling ashamed for doing everything right.", "NTA\nYour response was amazing", "NTA.

Your mom is free to let people walk all over and take advantage of her if she wants.  \n\nThose seats were yours, you paid for them.

The gentleman asked if he could see the toy, and I handed it to him, and he proceeded to buckle my minion toy into the empty seat. He said something to the steward to the effect of, \"now the toy has a place and you can stop asking me to give away my seat.\" The steward just stomped off, but other flight attendants thought it was the cutest thing. Upon talking to the gentleman, he had been asked three times by stewards and passengers if he REALLY needed that second seat, and he would just reply that he paid for it.

No. \n\nIt shouldn't be legal for them to separate kids under like 12 or so from their parents/guardians on flights.

They said they'd bring one for me, forgot, and then got upset when I wasn't buckled yet shortly and I tried to remind them that I had asked for extender. I got brushed off and told to buckle in now anyway. I was able to squeeze the belt around me, but I literally couldn't move and was very uncomfortable.

I haven't flown since then despite having lost signifanct weight because of that incident.", "I thought that at first too.", "I thought it was the stewardess too, but now rereading, it could be either. Regardless, if OP had booked only one seat, she would likely have been shamed by the person next to her for not booking two and crowding them.

It\u2019s sad those were the options.", "F/As can\u2019t comp seats, but if you\u2019re still at the gate, they can engage the gate agent who may be able to.", "Government doesn\u2019t regulate them (thanks, Reagan!) so they get more and more cramped to crank out even more profit while not even paying flight crew for any time not spent in the air.", "Once this happened to me (2 person booking got split) and I just nicely asked the gate agent and she moved us together. Unfortunately not possible on all flights tho", "This happened to me. My son, husband, and 1 were seated together but somehow my 3 yo daughter was booked several rows behind us. There was no option to pay for a change (except first class), and the gate agent told me oh well just try to swap once on board. \n\nAlthough in this instance, the first couple I asked declined (one was a caregiver for the other, although no reason was needed to just say no), so like a normal human I just asked a different person.\n\nETA: yes we could have had an adult in the single seat but anyone who has traveled with small children will confirm that a 1 adult to 1 toddler ratio is best for everyone\u2019s sanity.", "I booked months in advance for a long flight with my spouse and our 2yo. The airline cancelled our flight and rebooked us on a different flight and spread our seats out across the plane so we were all three in different rows in different parts of the plane.  Luckily I was able to keep checking the app and found seats together a couple of weeks later. The only \u201cpay\u201d for seats option was first class and that was out of our price range. \n\nAirline is often to blame when families get separated.", "She even made a fake account for this post.", "[removed]", "and it would probably be a credit, not cash back. That has to be used in a year.\n\nIt\u2019s a trap!", "And families are often cheap.\n\nI think your situation is the exemption", "Because it is the first post? Some people read about reddit posts on buzzfeed or listen to AITA stuff on Youtube. They only make accounts when needed. I started this way and made an account because I wanted to comment on something I read/listened about."]}
