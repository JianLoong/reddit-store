Flying out was great, the other person in my row was cool and we shared the middle seat and snacks and played pokemon on our switches and visited each other's animal crossing islands.\n\nFlying home was where things became a bit more problematic.\n\nI was settled into my pair of seats, and a gentleman tried to sit his daughter (\\~12, not a waif, nor was her overweight dad) in my middle seat, where my bum is taking up a good third of the middle seat. I said politely, \"I'm sorry, that seat is booked. Your daughter can't sit there,\" while putting my hand on the other 2/3s of the seat.\n\nHe immediately complained that he hadn't been able to book seats together and he needed to sit with his daughter. I shrugged and said I was sorry, but it wasn't my problem, that wasn't his seat.\n\nHe called over a stewardess to complain, I explained my situation and showed my pair of tickets, and the flight attendant offered to comp my extra seat. I said no thank you, I needed the extra room and waved to where my bum was partway into the middle seat.\n\nThe stewardess came back ten minutes later with a wife from a couple who agreed to switch seats so the man could sit with his daughter. But not without attempting to shame me for not be willing to help out a dad in need and commenting about how selfish I was.\n\nI said, \"I booked early, and I booked two seats together because to put it plainly, I'm fat. His two seats were separate seats. How exactly do you propose I split my fat ass in half to sit one half in one seat and the other half in his other seat?\"\n\nThe woman turned red in the face and bitched at me for being \"disgusting\", I replied that his lack of planning was not my emergency, and she scowled at me for the entire rest of the flight. When I told my folks about it after I landed, my dad thought it was the funniest thing he'd ever heard, but my mom yelled at him for encouraging him and said I should have been more willing to help out a dad with a kid when I had two seats.\n\nSo I want to know, AITA?", "created_utc": 1669497551, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z5i9c9/aita_for_refusing_to_give_up_my_seats_and_being/", "score": 457, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And you spent a lot of extra money to do so, I'm sure several hundred dollars overall.\n\nHe asked, and even though your were offered reimbursement, you declined, as is your right. And it sounds as though he would have been just as happy to take your extra seat without asking, and without the flight seeing you reimbursed if you hadn't had the courage to speak up for yourself.\n\nCongrats on standing up for yourself and taking care of your needs!", "NTA. You paid for an extra seat, he didn\u2019t book two together.

You paid good money for that seat so it\u2019s yours. She should sit in the seat that was bought for her. I am obese and so are my parents. When I was a kid they always used to sit me in the middle seat and I hated it because I was always squished and it was so uncomfortable (to this day I hate being in window or middle seats because of it.) Good on you for booking an extra seat both for yours and the other persons comfort. I wish you good luck in your health journey. You", "NTA. In the WHOOOOLE PLANE, there wasn't a single other person willing to swap seats? I'd have been tempted to let her sit there and just squish her personally.  And she's 12ish? I bet she'd have been happy to sit away from Dad and text her friends and not have him looking over her shoulder.  Congrats on the weight loss!!!!", "NTA. You started politely assertive. He escalated it, and didn\u2019t plan ahead or pay for the seating he desired, unlike you, who did.", "NTA\n\nIf the family had actually planned ahead as much as you did, they would have been able to book two seats next to one another.", "NTA\n\nYou did everything you needed to do properly. Both the father and the stewardess can ask, but once you denied, as is your right, that should've been the end of it. Maybe the father should've booked earlier instead of blaming you for his failure to do so. Maybe the stewardess should've treated you with the same consideration she did the father.", "NOPE, NTA.\n\nIn zero way we're you in the wrong. Besides that, it's a small space. You don't NEED to sit next to anyone on the plane. Being in a different row from a relative isn't going to make any difference.", "NTA\n\nYou took the time, effort and $$$ to make sure you had what you needed way a head of time.  That seat was taken.  I get why a father would want to sit with their kid, it would be okay to ASK but 'NO I booked this seat' should have been the end of it.  \n\nIf people had respected you from the get go there wouldn't have been a need to be so blunt - but they didn't.  Your funny AF explanation shut down any other argument.", "NTA. You were considerate to others around you and paid the extra for their comfort as much as your own. Sorry, but his 12yo doesn't get to sit and then make you feel uncomfortable when you paid for that space.\n\nWas it the airhostess that was rude? Or the lady who swapped? I would complain to the airline for the pressure you were put under. It's not fair.\n\nWell done on weight loss so far!", "Hahaha! Great response. I\u2019m sorry you had to deal with those AHs, but good for you for how you handled yourself.

Oh yeah, let me just take off a leg and arm and move them somewhere else.\n\nFat shaming is way too common. Shame on the lady.\n\nI bet if you had allowed it, there would have been some complaining about not enough room for the daughter or some bullshit.\n\nYou planned. You were smart. For him to expect such things because of his poor planning is ridiculous. We\u2019ve got our own shit going on.\n\nYou were thoughtful enough to book two fucking seats. He sounds very entitled.\n\nGood on you for sticking up for yourself.\n\nAlso very happy for your diagnosis!", "Wow Jesus. Totally NTA. To be honest you did something rather kind in my mind by booking two seats in the first place. The fact the stewardess had the nerve to address it this way is mind blowing. Not only NTA but I\u2019d write the company / post it on social media.", "NTA.  Like you said, what are you supposed to do, you need AND purchased two seats.", "NTA. I don\u2019t understand how you were shamed for paying for two seats to make yourself and your fellow passengers more comfortable. It seems like you can\u2019t win for losing; I\u2019m sure someone would have been annoyed if you were taking up a portion of their seat, which you actively made sure to not do. People are entitled and ridiculous. If someone cares that much about sitting next to their child, they should have thought through things ahead of time.", "NTA I like your style.  And you're 100% right his lack of planning is not your emergency.", "NTA\n\nThere was an entire plane load of people who could have offered to switch seats to help out the dad. Why are you the one being shamed?", "NTA and as for the offer to be compensated (even if you wanted that), I wouldn\u2019t trust an airline to follow through. I\u2019ve heard too many stories about people promised compensation and never getting it \u2014 all they get is another series of calls trying to get the airline to pony up.", "NTA. The dad is stupid and the random woman shaming you is quite bizarre. It\u2019s hard to wrap my head around the fact that people like her exist. she\u2019s probably fat phobic. But you did nothing wrong so f her", "NTA! NTA, you paid for both, for comfort and to avoid awkward situations. I would file a complaint against that flight attendant. She's TA!", "NTA.  and 12 isn't so young that she can't manage to sit by herself for a few hours.  You paid for the seat you needed, and you intended to use it.  Good on you.", "NTA at all. You tried to be non-confrontational and polite, but they weren't having it. So I think you said what you needed to in a very descriptive way.  You're a boss - much respect my friend!!!", "Definitely NTA, you were exactly correct! I applaud you got standing your ground!", "NTA", "NTA and you're fucking hilarious, I agree with your dad", "You are absolutely NTA. You paid for those seats. He could have booked two seats together and paid for them too, he just chose not to. If you had given up the seat he'd be bitching about how dare you be fat in \"his daughter's seat\". A teenager can sit on a plane a few rows away from her parent. There was no excuse for any of this nonsense.", "You did exactly \ud83d\udcaf what everyone is always saying people in that scenario should have done, planned ahead,  bought 2 seats and you're NTA. Also congratulations on finally having a diagnosis.  It's so hard when aside effect is weight because people assume and often times they assume the WRONG reasons. Congratulations on your journey.", "NTA.  You bought two seats, you were entitled to those two seats, regardless of your weight.  Had you been bone thin and still bought two seats (for whatever reason, such as not wanting to sit next to horribly entitled people), you STILL would not be an asshole.  You owned the right to those two seats for the duration of the flight.  Your weight is irrelevant.", "NTA she should have turned red. You had every right.", "NTA and thank you, you seem super cool about the situation. We need more people,like you. \n\nAll the best on your new health journey!", "NTA.  As you said, you cannot separate a portion of your ass to sit elsewhere. Airlines make it impossible for plus sized people to fit in an individual seat, and some even require you book two.  If the father needed to sit with his daughter, he should have discussed that with the gate attendants beforehand so they could find a passenger willing to give ip their seat.  None of this was your responsibility.  And you should complain to the airline about the flight attendant fat shaming you.", "nta you bought two seats because you are using two seats.", "NTA", "NTA    you booked a second seat because you didn't want another passenger to be uncomfortable, that shows you are compassionate. Screw that woman and her useless commentary.", "Absolutely NTA but def file a customer complaint with the airline.", "NTA.  Thank you for your consideration and forward thinking \ud83d\ude0a", "NTA, at all!  You planned ahead to ensure that your flight would be comfortable and relaxing.  Airline seats are narrow and tightly packed, so you planned it out, perfectly.  You were under no obligation to give up the seat, and you pointed out exactly the reasons you could not.  That man should have planned to get two seats together, and gotten there early enough to secure the seating.  That is a him problem.", "Nta.

The world does not stop turning because you screwed up your reservation.", "NTA\n\n> attempting to shame me for not be willing to help out a dad in need\n\n#HE DIDN'T \"NEED\" DICK\n\nThere was **zero** problem to solve here. A 12yo is perfectly capable of sitting separate from her parent on a plane.", "NTA you paid for these two seats so these two seats are yours and it's up to you what you do with them.", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83d\udc4f\ud83e\udd23\nNTA. Thanks for that.", "NTA.  You literally did everything you could possibly make it comfortable for you and prepared no one should complain", "NTA. if you bought 2 seats you are entitled to use those 2 seats unless its some kind of life or death situation. End of story", "NTA. Also: I\u2019m totally In agreement with your dad on this one!", "NTA and you\u2019re badass", "NTA Honestly, you probably couldn\u2019t have won. Even if you had let them sit there, who\u2019s to say they wouldn\u2019t have complained about space. You went well above and beyond to make sure the seat was yours, and you\u2019re right, although a bit crass, it\u2019s not your problem.", "NTA. As someone who\u2019s had to sit next to someone who really should have booked two seats, thank you for booking two. It makes everyone a lot less uncomfortable. \n\nAlso the stewardess was really unprofessional, wtf.", "NTA, and you\u2019re my new hero", "NTA. Others lack of planning isn't your problem.", "First of all: You don't need to justify to us about your body shape and however it got that way. You are worthy of dignity and respect no matter what size or shape you are. You're a person with agency and you used that agency to purchase two tickets, and they had no right to deny your agency or shame you for using it to insist on being treated the same as anyone else would wish to be treated were they in your situation. You are owed an apology by both the airline and the individuals involved here, and I hope you get one. \n\nIn case you don't I would like to apologize on behalf of society for treating you this way. I personally made some fatphobic comments and mistakes in my past, but I like to think that I've been educated on the issue since then. I hope these folks have the same experience I did and they learn that fatphobia is wrong and hurts all of us.\n\nNTA\n\nNTA in the slightest.", "Nta. You were correct.", "NTA. People need to understand that they aren\u2019t entitled to someone else\u2019s seat. I think it\u2019s fine to ask to change seats but if the person says no, then they need to accept that. You absolutely should have and have the right to stand your ground, you paid for those seats, not them.\n\nI commend you for buying two seats to ensure you and whoever is next to you are both comfortable. I\u2019m quite a small person and I always try to lean as far away from people as possible to give them space when I\u2019m in an aisle or window seat but I\u2018ve definitely been on flights where I\u2019m stuck touching someone the entire time no matter how hard I try. I appreciate your consideration for other people.", "12 year-olds can sit by themselves. Most would be happy to.
