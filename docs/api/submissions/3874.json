I once did one of those boardwalk drawings with my husband and they drew me crazy thin and him normal and I was just like wtf? I like my body as is why would you take it upon yourself to draw me thinner?

Or maybe sister has an unrealistic body image and sees herself as \"original\" Barbie thin? But it really seems there was no way for OP to know that picking out this doll would upset her sister. Especially given OP claims (and I see why) that she did not see the doll as fact or unattractive.\n\nApologizing is decent advice regardless, just as a way of handling her sister who is being irrational and unreasonable over sister's own issues.
