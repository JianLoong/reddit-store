We all know what a typical barbie looks like, she was prob expecting a brunette barbie in the type of outfit she would wear.

I doubt the sister was examining decades of conditioning to Barbie\u2019s insane proportions and comparing them with the average woman\u2019s frame.

They had zero sympathy for me and said there was nothing wrong with me. I\u2019m healthy now, no more rounds of bronchitis and pneumonia, and yet, I\u2019d be thrilled if I lost weight. It\u2019s a sickness, body dysmorphia. Our society tells us we\u2019re garbage if we aren\u2019t thin. But even knowing that, I still felt miserable and ugly and useless. I told my grown son that I was sad I had to buy new pants, and he cried. He said, \u201cMom, you look better than you ever have!\u201d That really made me stop and check myself.
