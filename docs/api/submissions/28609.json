You certainly would be justified, however if this coworker is as fanatic as she seems, it seems that this would either make her go into overdrive or go completely hostile.

They became very interested in my concert shirts and on some occasions asked, tried to take pictures.

Tell them about it because that\u2019s an issue and behavior that isn\u2019t okay in the workplace.", "NTA. I would say yes if you were to dress up like that at her church without her knowing beforehand, in the same way I would say a Christian dressing up as something specifically to be offensive in a pagan space would be TA, but the work space is not dedicated to Christianity, it\u2019s not a space specifically designated as pagan/witch free, and as you said she also brings religious things in. It would only be fair if you were allowed to dress witchy, bring related things, and talk about your religion as freely as she does.", "Would your costume contravene dress code at work? That's something to consider. It's certainly tempting, I get that, but it might be better to politely tell the woman to stop disrespecting your boundaries or you will go to HR. Tell her the Lord has better things to do than worry about a Pagan woman who is hurting nobody and bothering nobody.", "So, pagans are now witches? \ud83e\udd23", "NTA but you'd be better off going to her or your manager and telling them that she won't leave you alone about your religion. She needs to keep her Jesus to herself.", "Talk to hr she is being very inappropriate. You've told her multiple times no and she refuses to stop that is definitely something hr should be involved in.", "NTA. But as a former Baptist it will likely backfire. She'll see you as even more in need of Saving and will step up the efforts. 100% you are already on the Church's Prayer List. Don't know what kind of Baptist she is, but the Baptists I was raised with thought Catholics were going to hell. Pagan?? Whoo boy. Prepare for 24/7 mission to convert. Christian books, sending you \"inspirational\" Bible passages, redoubling on inviting you to church and Bible Study. \"We have a ladies Bible study that meets once a week. It's really more of a chance to socialize and share with each other. Kind of a support group. C'mon, why don't you just come give it a try? The ladies are wonderful and it's always nice to have more friends and people to provide support.\"\n\nWhich will be a weekly ask, cajoling. Being invited to every church social event like potlucks. Presented as an easy fun, no pressure thing but which they'll use to try and suck you in. Ask you to go out for coffee with her and her pastor. So on and so forth. If the nice stuff doesn't work, then it will move to the you're going to go to Hell arguments. \n\nIt would definitely be fun to see her reaction. A lot of Baptists think Harry Potter is witchcraft and from the Devil himself. I would die to see her face when shown a grimoire. But to her, it would likely be her absolute proof that God HAS called her to \"Save\" you and she absolutely has to make you see the light and accept Jesus Christ as your personal Lord and Savior.", "NTA\n\nBut as someone else said take this to HR, it is borderline harassment.", "Are you in the US? I'm Jewish, and if a Christian coworker told me that the Lord called her to convert me, I would probably respond very badly. The fact that she believes she's trying to help you does not prevent her from understanding that it isn't appropriate behavior in this context. You don't know if she's done this before or who else she is doing this to. You tried doing it the nice way.", "She's harassing you. She may not know you're pagan, but she knows you're not christian & she is trying to convert you on work time. Don't know where you are, but in the US, that is against the law.\n\nFull disclosure. I've been out of the broom closet since I was about your age. I wear pentacles openly. I decorate my desk with crystals. I even have a mini altar for my desk. It isn't obvious, but if *you* were to see it, for example, you'd know what it was.\n\nI've been fortunate in never encountering any sort of harassment or blowback from family, friends, coworkers, or bosses, but I wouldn't hesitate to go to HR if a coworker was proselytizing. \n\nGood luck and Blessed Be!", "Wouldn't that also be an asshole move? To quote another commenter, this is a petty dispute. I don't appreciate her pushyness but I want her to quit trying to convert me without getting her fired", " I have used my words. They aren't working. I think I'm going to take everyone else's advice and go to my supervisor then HR if nothing gets done about it. Thank you for your judgment", "Ooof, nope. Clearly don't know any Baptists. Other than American Baptists (maybe) telling her coworker she is pagan and will work a ritual for her will only make her coworker work HARDER to convert her. My church taught that CATHOLICS were going to hell. We needed to convert anyone who wasn't Baptist (even other Protestant Christians). A good portion of Baptists won't let their children read or watch Harry Potter. They think it's witchcraft and comes from the Devil. An actual Pagan like OP? It will be come her coworkers mission to convert her. She needs to save OP's soul.", "Freaking oof. I'm sorry that happened to you", "you're not a witch", "I've tried that. I said \"I'm not really comfortable discussing religion at work\" this last time and she keeps attempting", "That's fair. Thank you for your judgment!", ">she's probably trying to be nice and just doesn't realise that you don't have to be baptist to go to heaven (or that heaven doesn't exist)\n\nI am SO FAR BEYOND giving people like that the benefit of the doubt.\n\nShe's not trying to be \"nice\".  She's acting on the instructions her church has given her regarding converting others.  Trying to \"save\" someone like that automatically involves disrespecting the other person's autonomy and right to make their own decisions.  It doesn't matter whether OP is neopagan, or Jewish, or atheist.  OP has made her own choices about religion.  This Christian nut doesn't RESPECT that, though.  Lack of respect isn't \"nice\".  \"I'm doing this for your own good\" isn't \"nice\" either.\n\nAnd it's not that she doesn't \"realize\" that other people don't have to be Baptists or that heaven and hell don't exist.  It's that she actively BELIEVES that if other people are not converted, then they'll be damned.  She knows very well that there are people out there who don't worship as her own church dictates, and that there are a lot of people who don't believe in heaven, hell, Satan, or any Christian doctrine. She just thinks all of those people are WRONG. \n\n(She absolutely knows, because preachers in those proselytizing sects are always actively telling their congregations about all the godless heathens out there who need to be saved.  It's part of the way that cults like that cement a group identity -- they have to emphasize their own group as necessary to protect each other against all of the Others who don't believe as they do, and who are hostile towards them.  You don't GET proselytizers like this unless you have someone telling them incessantly that proselytizing and conversion is a necessity.)\n\nThere are also plenty of people who are raised in strict religious sects like this, who develop the ability to look around them and realize that it's bullshit.  Or, at the very least, there are plenty of people who go out into the workplace and encounter people who do not belong to their own sect, and realize that they have to allow other people to live their lives.  So I won't even excuse this particular woman for having been so brainwashed that she just doesn't know any better.", "So, you believe you just stop existing at death? I genuinely feel sorry for you. That seems so sad to me. I don't believe in the Bible at all,  but I do believe in an afterlife. To not believe feels... so pointless. I'm not, in any way disparingy your believes. I just genuinely feel sad.", "While I agree overall that OP shouldn't do this, I'm not sure I would characterize this idea as a \"petty revenge game\".  Being more open about her own religion is OP's right.  Doing it in response to pressure from this Christian proselytizer could be taken as an attempt to assert her own right to express her religion in a work-appropriate way.  If this nut was harassing someone who's Jewish, you wouldn't call the Jewish person \"petty\" for wearing a Star of David necklace more prominently.\n\nWhere I agree with you, though, is that the whole thing with the grimoire is where it gets into immaturity.  This other person displaying her Bible at work is not work-appropriate.  Neither is displaying a grimoire solely for the purpose of countering the Bible display.  Two wrongs don't make a right, and I agree that OP should know that by now.\n\nHowever, I also don't think OP should \"swallow her pride\" and just put up with this.  It's NOT a petty dispute, and OP should go to HR about it.", "No, it wouldn't.  Assuming you're in the US, religious harassment is illegal.  According to another comment, you've asked her directly to stop, and she doesn't, so the next step is HR.  More than likely she will not be fired, unless she already has a history with them of harassing other employees.  In many workplaces, 1st offense is a warning.  And if she *does* get fired over it, it's her fault, not yours, and almost certainly because this is not the first time she's crossed that line.", "Not at all. But you can say, look, if you don't stop, I will go to HR. So give her a heads up. I doubt they'd fire her; they'd just give her a warning.\n\nI don't see how dressing up will achieve anything productive.", "This is not a petty dispute, although with your plan to \u201cdress witchy\u201d, I can see why someone might get confused.  This is an instance in which a coworker is talking about a sensitive, non-work related subject that makes you uncomfortable.  Asking her to stop once should have been enough.  Any pressure after that is an HR complaint.", "YWBTA if you dressed like a witch not because you wore the outfit but because the result likely would be increased pressure from the nut. By reporting this to HR, you'd stop this behavior, which also would protect others from the religious assaults of this person. Not everyone is as able to laugh about your co-worker's nasty religiosity.", "I work in HR, and unless she's got a history of doing this and has been warned/reprimanded multiple times already, odds are this will only result in a coaching conversation, probably not even a written warning. The main use of reporting this is for her to get An Serious Talking To that she should hopefully take seriously - and to begin creating the paper trail so that if she does this to someone else, HR will be able to see the pattern rather than thinking it's the first incident.\n\nAs I always tell people, we're not psychic, we can't help with situations we don't know about.\n\nIf you want to be extra kind to her, give her one last warning. \"I've told you before, I am not interested in converting. Your continued pushing of your religion on me is unwelcome and unacceptable. If you don't drop it, I will be forced to talk to HR about this. Please do not talk to me about religion anymore.\"\n\nAlso: please document things as best you can, just in case you need to take it to HR. The more concrete info you can bring, the more help they can be. Dates, who was present during the conversation (especially other coworkers who might have witnessed the behavior), what was said (quoting the Bible at you, inviting you to church and whether it was the first or tenth time it happened, etc.), as much detail as you can include.", "No that\u2019s not an AH move at all She may listen to HR since her proselytizing puts the company in legal jeopardy if/when she does it to someone else and they sue. She\u2019s creating a hostile work environment", "When I was hired at my job, the HR person said \"you didn't get the person fired/in trouble, they got themselves in trouble.\"\n\nThe lady is harrassing you. If she gets fired, that's HER fault.", "No, it would not be an asshole move.  She doesn't have to be fired, but she does have to respect that you have your own religion and do not wish to be pressured into converting to hers.  SHE is the one creating the hostile work environment.\n\nKeep it even-keeled and dispassionate when talking to HR (unless you get the feeling from their reaction that they KNOW the other person is in the wrong).  You have your religion.  You do not wish to convert.  And with her statement that \"the Lord called me to convert you\", it's clearly moved beyond the point where you can or should \"humor\" her and just let her talk about religion.  She is putting unwelcome pressure on you and she won't take \"no\" for an answer.  \"No\" should be a perfectly acceptable response to ANY coworker talking to you about things you don't want to talk to them about.\n\nYou are, of course, in the best position to judge whether doing anything will result in blowback -- either from coworkers, or from HR itself.  I don't know where you live, or how heavily Christian everyone there is, and how likely they might be to side with the proselytizer.  But if your HR is worth anything at all, they will know that harassment on the basis of religion is just as much a no-go as harassment on the basis of any other protected class.  And at the very least, they need to have a little chat with her about taking \"No\" for an answer.\n\nThe only way she would get fired for this would be if there is a trail of similar complaints against her, and if she's been warned by HR multiple times to knock it off.  At that point, it STILL would not be your fault if she gets fired.", "Your taking it lightheartedly it seems, but it\u2019s not petty. It\u2019s incredibly inappropriate and unprofessional. It also seems like you\u2019ve rejected the proselytizing and it continues, which raises it to the level of harassment.\n\nEdit to add, as I accidentally hit the button to post the comment.\n\nNAL, but Ive presented workers rights workshops and one of the shitty things to have to say, as I\u2019m US based, is that it\u2019s not illegal to have a boss or coworker be an asshole, be toxic, whatever. Unless you are dealing in a limited range of protected classes, which religion is. On top of that, single acts that are rebuffed and never raised again are harder to get action. But you are likely experiencing an actual hostile workplace. As someone who has been there and took it with a laugh, it\u2019s still important to address it for people who might not deal with it as well.", "It's not a petty dispute, she's harassing you. If she doesn't stop, she probably should be fired.", "Here's an even funnier idea - dress up as a witch *for church*.  Take her up on her offer, and show up to her church (making sure to be VERY friendly with her in front of everyone) dressed in your solstice best lmao.  I bet it would embarrass the crap out of her and get her off your back for good.  Is it mature, maybe not lol but I bet it would be effective.", "Use your words to tell HR what she\u2019s doing which is harassment  poses a legal liability to the company", "Look, in today's work environment, if a co-worker annoys you or harasses you, whatever you do don't annoy or harass them in turn!  That is highly likely to go wrong, you can end up as the one who's being disciplined or fired.  \n\nSo that's why you shouldn't yield to the temptation to come to this idiot's church covered in pentagrams and carrying a trident.  If you did that you'd have a sworn enemy on your hands, rather than an annoyance, and that could make life incredibly difficult, and don't think everyone in your workplace would automatically side with you, from HR on down.", "It was a lesson that I needed to learn. \n\nMy favorite thing to do now is quote the Bible back to them lol.

It\u2019s worked every time", "and you didn't follow up?", "That would be the line I would take with HR.  \"I prefer to keep my private life private.\"\n\nAnd don't forget Threefold Law, too.  If you do something to deliberately make her feel uncomfortable, or try to teach her a lesson, well, we all know how that'll end.  \n\nBut I feel you.  I used to work with an Evangelical Christian.  She was a really nice lady, but I could never let even a hint drop.", "Some may feel sorry for you... people who live their life on a basis which expects some kind of 'return' and otherwise think it's pointless.
