It wasn\u2019t mine but I was in a public area and there was no way of me finding out who the owner was so I cashed in the ticket and it was a winner. I won one of the medium prizes which was one ticket to the local aquarium. \n\nI told my boyfriend (M19) about my win and asked him if he wanted to come with me. He said he wanted to go but things got a bit heated when we started talking about his ticket. He said that I should pay for half of his ticket and when I asked him why I should have to pay for half he told me that because I got my ticket for free that paying for half of his ticket would still be a win for me because I would only have to pay for half a ticket instead of a full fee for myself. I told him that I don\u2019t think its fair that I should have to pay for half of his ticket and didn\u2019t see the reason why I should and he told me that it would be more fair for him because I get to go for free and that I should help him out because I make more money than him. He was still mad at me for refusing to pay for his half like an hour later and I just don\u2019t understand why I need to pay for half of his ticket. \n\nWhen I got home I asked my mum and my brother about the situation, my mum said that I shouldn\u2019t have to pay for him but my brother says that because I found the raffle ticket initially and didn\u2019t buy it that it\u2019s unfair for me to go for free and that I should chip in for his ticket. It just feels bad because this argument is essentially over $20.\n\n-Edit for context because people have been asking how we normally pay on our dates: we will normally pay for our own things on dates nine times out of ten. There are exceptions like special occasions or birthdays but most of the time if we are say both going to a movie we will both buy our own ticket or if we are going to a restaurant and I order something that is $20 and he orders something that is $30 then I will pay $20 and he will pay $30.", "created_utc": 1695038947, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16ltsul/aita_for_not_paying_for_my_boyfriends_ticket/", "score": 88, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's too bad your BF wants to harsh your mellow by being cheap and trying to benefit from your win instead of letting you enjoy it.", "NTA, you found a ticket which caused you to decide to go to the aquarium. You asked your boyfriend if he would like to go, if he says yes, he pays, if he say no, you go by yourself. The way you got your ticket does not matter.", "Almost this exact scenario happened to me once. Except I \u201cwon the ticket\u201d and I asked my girlfriend along. She didn\u2019t ask me to pay half but I did it myself because I like to share my joy with her.", "NTA - if he wants to join you, he can pay for his ticket. The fact that you won free entry doesn\u2019t extend to him being entitled to anything. He\u2019s trying to manipulate you into paying his way- it\u2019s giving AH bf vibes.", "NTA, he is free to not go to the aquarium and it's your ticket. To be fair if I was in your position I would probably still offer to pay half of my gf's ticket, simply because it's the humble thing to do. (Or make her pay the ticket, and pay for eating out afterwards, was aren't that strict)", "NTA - It's clear that your boyfriend is no prize.", "Nta lol your brother is AH x2.   You got a free ticket so its unfair for you to go for free\u2026.what kind of ridiculous attitude is that\n\nBf, nah\n\nHe can want, you can decline.  Actually hes AH because he got more baggage and wants to split the cost if your free ticket\n\nSmh people these days dont know how to date", "NTA\n\nYou got the free ticket, not him. You also invited him, not insisted that he goes. I don't think there is anything wrong with expecting him to pay his own way.\n\nI'd be more concerned about the fact it was only a $20 ticket. What happens if you move in together? I'm pretty sure there will be issues that cost a lot more than $20 on a regular basis and you don't want every one of those to end in an argument.", "NTA. However, if I were you I probably would have offered to pay for half of their ticket and they would have probably thanked me but insisted on paying for their own.", "Nta", "YTA. If you want to go for free, go for free! If you want to bring a friend, you share the total cost! Of course he was offended.", "YTA- it was pretty selfish not to offer to pay half, up front when you invited him. Depending on your dynamic of how you pay for things, when you get something for free it\u2019s just nice to offer to share a little with a discount. The hilarious thing is, it wasn\u2019t really even yours to begin with.", "Nta\n\nYour boyfriend and brother are acting like babies.\n\nEither go alone or with someone that doesn\u2019t care about buying their own ticket.", "YTA. When you invite someone out, you're paying for them to come with in every conceivable situation... unless you're a woman on reddit it seems, then the boyfriend asking for half is seen as an egregious error.", "NAH I can understand both tbh. It was your luck that got you the ticket... double luck! Meanwhile you asked him if he wanted to come and while I'm sure he likes spending time with you he can't possibly say NO I don't have the money so it feels a bit unfair that he has to dip into his budget while you get to go completely free. It's also unfair that you have to pay for his ticket. I think you should probably tell him something along the lines it's OKAY you don't have to come just cuz I asked you to we can have another date later, if he feels like he's offending you by not going with you you need to clear the air.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You asked him on a \"date\" but instead of sharing the cost, as you presumably do with other dates, you want him to pay the full cost of the date activity because one of the tickets was free. This should be viewed as a half price date, rather than free for one person and full price for the other.", "Agreed. Especially when he brought up the fact that you make more money.

If she wants him to come and is inviting him, it would be the nice/normal thing to pay for half his ticket and enjoy the half price entry date. If she would rather go alone than pay half price, don't pay for his partial ticket and then she can go by herself to the free aquarium day. \n\nIf he didn't want to pay full price to go to the aquarium, he should have just said as much and turned it down when he realized she wasn't sharing her find rather than being angry turning it into a fight.", "I would have paid with whoever I invited along with me if the cost of my admission was already paid for just because I value my people and their time and appreciate them choosing to spend it with me, but I can\u2019t say that\u2019s the standard. According to how I would react, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re right, but I don\u2019t think he is either, so really you\u2019ve got to settle this on your own.", "ESH - you are fighting over what is likely about the cost of a mcdonald's meal.  Hard to believe you both could be this petty over such a small amount of money. Besides, you invited your BF to come with you - it's not like you were looking forward to a day alone and he's insisting that you take him with you.", "YTA.  Since the ticket was a windfall, and you asked if he wanted to come with you, you should have split the cost of his ticket.  Perhaps a little ESH because the amount is a petty matter and not worth him making an issue.", "NAH - it's fine if you don't want to pay for him. Be aware this means he might decide he can't or doesn't want to go though. If that happens, I don't think you have any right to complain. Sometimes you need to be willing to help people out in order to not do things alone.", "I wouldn't say YTA cause it's a small disagreement and not really deserving of that title compared to other stories on here BUT I believe the person who's idea it was to go on the date should be the one to pay.", "NTA however whoever was in charge of prizes for that competition sure is. Who gives only a single ticket as a prize, especially when the tickets only cost $20?", "Both petty and immature.\n\nThe nice thing to do with a SO would be to split the win.\n\nHe reacted poorly but kinda ESH.", "INFO - how much did you want his company?\n\nWhy didn\u2019t you go alone, when he said he wasn\u2019t comfortable paying full entrance price for an unplanned date - especially given his only reason for going was to provide company for you?\n\nThe fact that you didn\u2019t say \u201cnever mind, I\u2019m happy to go alone\u201d implies that you probably *really* wanted his company & wouldn\u2019t have used the ticket if you had to go alone. \n\nWhich would mean YTA here.", "YTA is the only one correct comment here by another commenter and I don\u2019t know how they\u2019re the only one who sees this. Although I wouldn\u2019t ask her to pay half if I were the bf in this scenario I would have definitely appreciated the girl having the thought in the first place and not getting defensive if I did ask. Yes she got a free ticket. But that\u2019s for her to go alone and if she wants to invite a date that is her bf a non-selfish person would think hey we get a half priced date. It\u2019s a joint thing. She said herself they usually split. Or invite him and he pays for his ticket but you offer to pay for snacks etc since you didn\u2019t have to pay for yours.", "YTA and im willing to bet that the n t a are women. You got a free thing and invited your boyfriend on a date which will cost him money. The polite thing to do is offer to split the price of his ticket. It is tacky to make someone pay full price in a situation like this when they know you are getting it for free or at an unusually high discount.", "Ridiculously petty thing for bf to fuss about. You're NTA. You might have offered a split, but he was wrong to demand it.", "Yta for not seeing the big picture. You wouldn't go except for luck. You're going because it's free, but you expect your bf to pay to go do something you want just because he gets to spend time with you. Why not try and see his side and realize you're being unfair to him. Neither of you would be going if not for your luck, so why should he get punished with paying because of circumstance? Frankly, I'd be concerned and second guessing the relationship because of your obliviousness and selfishness.", "NTA", "NTA, if he won the lottery would he give you half? After all it's free money.", "NAH, because this is one of those grey areas where it could go differently, depending on how established your relationship is, your respective financial situations, etc \n\nHowever, not much generosity or consideration here either, by the sound of it. In a partnership, you want the best outcome for both people, and for a date to be an opportunity to make good memories together. \n\nIf you asked him intending for it to be a shared experience, wouldn't it be reasonable to do what you usually do and split the cost of that experience, which in this case is the cost of one ticket? That's what sharing your lucky win would look like, imo.\n\nIf, however, you just asked him because you want your free aquarium trip but don't want to go alone, you can understand why he might not feel great about that, especially if he doesn't have a lot of disposable income.", "NTA... Did he perceive the invitation as you treating him?", "YTA. \nDo you even like your boyfriend?\nYou had a perfect opportunity to do something nice for him yet chose not to.\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t understand why I need to pay for half of his ticket\u201d\nYou don\u2019t, but when I\u2019m a relationship this kind of situation is a no-brainer.\n\nDue to the nature of my job I get free admission into a lot of different attractions/locations. Every time I go to one with my partner, I pay for half of her ticket. I love being able to make life that little bit easier and cheaper for the woman I\u2019m in love with. To me it also seems like the that is the fair thing to do.", "nta this isn\u2019t a date you planned together, you happened to win a ticket for yourself. if your bf wants a ticket he can either win his own or buy one edit typo", "NTA\n\n\n\nBut here's the part you don't want to hear: this guy is a loser and you need to get rid of him.", "NTA but def would make me question the relationship a bit. I sometimes got tickets for free for some parties since I know the organizers, and sometimes my ex and my friends would also get tickets, but the times we didn't we just kind of shared the cost of whatever someone paid for tickets. For me that's just the decent thing to do, if I didn't pay for the ticket anyway.", "Honestly this is such a small thing for him to get pety over. We're taking about a $20 dollar ticket.\n\nNot a $200 concert or something.\n\nYou don't want to spend $20 and spend a day with your gf at the aquarium? Your loss.", "This is over $20? Man theres frugal then theres stupid.", "NAH.\n\nYou're not required to help pay for his ticket, but given you got yours for free and subsequently invited him along, splitting 50/50 would be the courteous thing to do. This should be seen as a half price date for both of you rather than free for one but full price for the other.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHad he been a good BF he would have insisted that your entire day be free and paid for your lunch and things like that.   I never understand why people try to bring money into every situation.", "ESH for being petty dicks to each other over such a mundane thing. Like 20 bucks... really? \n\nCouldn't find any better way of spending time together other than arguing over a 20 sheet? There was abolutely nothing more productive you two could have done with your time? Nothing at all? That's pretty fucked, I'll be totally honest here....", "Honestly, it wouldn\u2019t even occur to me not to split the price of the remaining ticket. Maybe it\u2019s less an AH thing and more a values system? But I would want to share my joy/experience and it\u2019s nicer when we all win. Feels selfish to me not to.", "this is the correct answer", "Agreed. Esh- her for asking him on a date and then not paying. Him for making such a fuss over who is paying. He should have just said I don't want to pay for it and declined.", "no mature adult *expects* the other party to pay just because they invited them", "this isn\u2019t a date she won a free trip to an aquarium. she is going whether he hoes or not. he did not win a free trip to the aquarium. if he wants to go with her he has to pay", "A company who wants to be seen to contribute to whatever cause the raffle supported, but also wants to make a bit of money - because they now most people will want a friend to join them.", "Same. If you go with someone you like, why not split the second ticket? You both pay the same, the windfall affects both people positively, and no one gets hurt or upset. It's the best outcome.", "I always did the whole you ask to costly things, you pay for costly things. To him, that ticket is costly and more than he can afford and he might be embarrassed about it.\nAnyways, I pay for my FRIENDS when I ask them to stuff like this or offer to.", "I always did the whole you ask to costly things, you pay for costly things.

(Well unless the ticket was cheap) that way it's not like your stepping in, but instead treating.", "What else do you call it when you invite your SO out to an activity with just the two of you?", "But she asked him to join her - as the commenter above said, presumably because she thought she would enjoy her use of the free ticket MORE if he joined her. \n\nWhich is what made it a date. \n\nIf she would have been happy to go alone, then she should have either said that while inviting him, or after he said he assumed it was a date and therefore usual date-night rules applied. \n\nOr even she should have just gone on her own, if his presence was so irrelevant to her. \n\nThat\u2019s something that tends to come with time & experience - realising that you can just go do stuff on your own & enjoy the simplicity of it.

So you're saying that our life is all one big date because we're doing things together, just the two of us? So if me and a male friend go out and do something, just the two of us, it's a date? Because we're alone? It doesn't make sense.", "Less than a year ago he was your bf and trying to make you get rid of your cat and you threw out a bunch of your clothes because of a comment he made.
