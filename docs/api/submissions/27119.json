{"id": 27119, "submission_id": "16ltsul", "title": "AITA for not paying for my boyfriend\u2019s ticket?", "selftext": "This started when I (F19) found a raffle ticket. It wasn\u2019t mine but I was in a public area and there was no way of me finding out who the owner was so I cashed in the ticket and it was a winner. I won one of the medium prizes which was one ticket to the local aquarium. \n\nI told my boyfriend (M19) about my win and asked him if he wanted to come with me. He said he wanted to go but things got a bit heated when we started talking about his ticket. He said that I should pay for half of his ticket and when I asked him why I should have to pay for half he told me that because I got my ticket for free that paying for half of his ticket would still be a win for me because I would only have to pay for half a ticket instead of a full fee for myself. I told him that I don\u2019t think its fair that I should have to pay for half of his ticket and didn\u2019t see the reason why I should and he told me that it would be more fair for him because I get to go for free and that I should help him out because I make more money than him. He was still mad at me for refusing to pay for his half like an hour later and I just don\u2019t understand why I need to pay for half of his ticket. \n\nWhen I got home I asked my mum and my brother about the situation, my mum said that I shouldn\u2019t have to pay for him but my brother says that because I found the raffle ticket initially and didn\u2019t buy it that it\u2019s unfair for me to go for free and that I should chip in for his ticket. It just feels bad because this argument is essentially over $20.\n\n-Edit for context because people have been asking how we normally pay on our dates: we will normally pay for our own things on dates nine times out of ten. There are exceptions like special occasions or birthdays but most of the time if we are say both going to a movie we will both buy our own ticket or if we are going to a restaurant and I order something that is $20 and he orders something that is $30 then I will pay $20 and he will pay $30.", "created_utc": 1695038947, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16ltsul/aita_for_not_paying_for_my_boyfriends_ticket/", "score": 15, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's too bad your BF wants to harsh your mellow by being cheap and trying to benefit from your win instead of letting you enjoy it.", "NTA, you found a ticket which caused you to decide to go to the aquarium. You asked your boyfriend if he would like to go, if he says yes, he pays, if he say no, you go by yourself. The way you got your ticket does not matter.", "Almost this exact scenario happened to me once. Except I \u201cwon the ticket\u201d and I asked my girlfriend along. She didn\u2019t ask me to pay half but I did it myself because I like to share my joy with her.", "NTA - if he wants to join you, he can pay for his ticket. The fact that you won free entry doesn\u2019t extend to him being entitled to anything. He\u2019s trying to manipulate you into paying his way- it\u2019s giving AH bf vibes.", "NTA, he is free to not go to the aquarium and it's your ticket. To be fair if I was in your position I would probably still offer to pay half of my gf's ticket, simply because it's the humble thing to do. (Or make her pay the ticket, and pay for eating out afterwards, was aren't that strict)", "NTA - It's clear that your boyfriend is no prize.", "Nta lol your brother is AH x2.   You got a free ticket so its unfair for you to go for free\u2026.what kind of ridiculous attitude is that\n\nBf, nah\n\nHe can want, you can decline.  Actually hes AH because he got more baggage and wants to split the cost if your free ticket\n\nSmh people these days dont know how to date", "NTA\n\nYou got the free ticket, not him. You also invited him, not insisted that he goes. I don't think there is anything wrong with expecting him to pay his own way.\n\nI'd be more concerned about the fact it was only a $20 ticket. What happens if you move in together? I'm pretty sure there will be issues that cost a lot more than $20 on a regular basis and you don't want every one of those to end in an argument.", "NTA. However, if I were you I probably would have offered to pay for half of their ticket and they would have probably thanked me but insisted on paying for their own.", "Nta", "YTA. If you want to go for free, go for free! If you want to bring a friend, you share the total cost! Of course he was offended.", "YTA- it was pretty selfish not to offer to pay half, up front when you invited him. Depending on your dynamic of how you pay for things, when you get something for free it\u2019s just nice to offer to share a little with a discount. The hilarious thing is, it wasn\u2019t really even yours to begin with.", "Nta\n\nYour boyfriend and brother are acting like babies.\n\nEither go alone or with someone that doesn\u2019t care about buying their own ticket.", "YTA. When you invite someone out, you're paying for them to come with in every conceivable situation... unless you're a woman on reddit it seems, then the boyfriend asking for half is seen as an egregious error.", "NAH I can understand both tbh. It was your luck that got you the ticket... double luck! Meanwhile you asked him if he wanted to come and while I'm sure he likes spending time with you he can't possibly say NO I don't have the money so it feels a bit unfair that he has to dip into his budget while you get to go completely free. It's also unfair that you have to pay for his ticket. I think you should probably tell him something along the lines it's OKAY you don't have to come just cuz I asked you to we can have another date later, if he feels like he's offending you by not going with you you need to clear the air.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You asked him on a \"date\" but instead of sharing the cost, as you presumably do with other dates, you want him to pay the full cost of the date activity because one of the tickets was free.
