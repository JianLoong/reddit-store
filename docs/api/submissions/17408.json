Also, I think it's extremely rude to call someone stupid. I used to help a differently-abled senior who lived alone and had no family nearby by shopping for her groceries (before InstaCart). I cooked dinner and ate with her once a week. My husband thought that was fine. I guess I could have charged her for my time. No thanks. Many of us like to help others.", "YTA that is about the meanest way to suggest she could ask people to pay her something for her work trough platforms like Patreon or whatever. Also not everything has to be about money. You might just be incompatible in that worldview. I would dump you if i had been your girlfriend because from this situation you not only showed me you think it's impossible to value anything more than money,  which is a worldview i dislike in a partner. And you are just plain old mean when you disagree with someone you supposedly care for which is a big ass dealbreaker for me", "YTA. your girlfriend is one of the few good people left in the world, and you're trying to verbally beat it out of her. Leave the poor girl alone. We could all stand to do some unpaid labor. It's good for the character.", "YTA that's for sure.\n\nBut I always has a good laugh of these \"I told it to a friend already and they picked my side\" comments.
