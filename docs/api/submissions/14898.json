I arrived at my hotel at 10:30pm, the check in took longer than I thought it should with a few winks and smiles from the receptionist, I got my keys and turned into my room.\n\nAt around 11pm I got a text from an unknown number \u201cHey how have you been, we haven\u2019t caught up in so long.\u201d I got a new number less than a month prior so I was instantly confused as I don\u2019t give my number out to many people. I responded with \u201cI am sorry I am not sure who this is would you be able to tell me?\u201d They responded by introducing themselves as someone I went to college with years prior, lets call them Brad, saying they got my number from a mutual friend and just wanted to catch up.\n\nBrad is someone I ran into quite a bit in college as he dated one of my closer friends for over a year. Brad is also someone I have on instagram so I sent them a quick message asking them why they didn\u2019t just message me on there instead. Brad responded saying he had no idea what I was talking about and he hasn't texted me or thought of me since we left school.\n\nI only sent messages asking how they knew me, saying how I don\u2019t give out my number and asking what friend they got the number from. Suddenly they had a change in persona and said \u201cActually I\u2019m not Brad, I was his roommate Caden and always had a crush on you\u201d \n\nI was even more confused how they got my number as I had never met Caden. I started asking some friends without responding to his messages and I get a text that says \u201cI gotta say you have a nice a** and some nice long hair\u201d I ignored the message. Soon after I found a picture of Caden on an instagram picture with Brad from a month prior to this. I instantly recognized Caden as the receptionist at the hotel I was staying at. I texted the number back saying \u201care you the receptionist that checked me in at my hotel?\u201d \n\nCaden then responded with \u201chaha yea. I recognized you and thought you had a great a** so I got your number off the check in receipt and decided to shoot my shot\u201d I knew this was not okay and I also did not like the fact that he had access to my room if he wanted. I soon got another text \u201cI\u2019m free tonight if you want some company and not the sleeping kind ;)\u201d At this point I was scared he would come into my room and I stayed up all night and left early the next morning.\n\nAs I was driving I called the hotel and spoke to a manager saying I was very uncomfortable with my stay since their worker took my number out of my account and talked about coming to my hotel room to ***. They apologized and said they would take care of it. I recently found out he was fired due to the situation and now all the mutual friends we both have are upset with me for getting him fired from his job. AITA for reporting him to his boss for taking my number and flirting with me?", "created_utc": 1681606170, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12np464/aita_for_getting_a_hotel_receptionist_fired_for/", "score": 47, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

No. Ew.", "NTA. Completely inappropriate for someone who works in a hotel to abuse their access like that.

You likely actually saved someone else from this type of harassment and potentially worse. This shows a deep and really profound lack of professional boundaries.

What he did was totally inappropriate.", "NTA. Caden got himself fired allllll on his own. An employee misusing a customer\u2019s personal information is a HUGE deal. A company can\u2019t afford to take it lightly. Add to him taking what that is supposed to be kept secure, he also had the ability to access your room without your consent.

Anyone else was probably too scared. Any friend that has sympathy for Caden can kick rocks. None of them would be crying \u201cbut the poor creep\u201d if this happened to them. The sad part of all of this is Caden will go on to get another job and they probably won\u2019t have any idea that he takes customer information so he can be a creep. With your \u201cfriends\u201d being poor Caden, he\u2019s isn\u2019t going to learn from this. Drop the friends.
