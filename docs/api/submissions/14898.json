I arrived at my hotel at 10:30pm, the check in took longer than I thought it should with a few winks and smiles from the receptionist, I got my keys and turned into my room.\n\nAt around 11pm I got a text from an unknown number \u201cHey how have you been, we haven\u2019t caught up in so long.\u201d I got a new number less than a month prior so I was instantly confused as I don\u2019t give my number out to many people. I responded with \u201cI am sorry I am not sure who this is would you be able to tell me?\u201d They responded by introducing themselves as someone I went to college with years prior, lets call them Brad, saying they got my number from a mutual friend and just wanted to catch up.\n\nBrad is someone I ran into quite a bit in college as he dated one of my closer friends for over a year. Brad is also someone I have on instagram so I sent them a quick message asking them why they didn\u2019t just message me on there instead. Brad responded saying he had no idea what I was talking about and he hasn't texted me or thought of me since we left school.\n\nI only sent messages asking how they knew me, saying how I don\u2019t give out my number and asking what friend they got the number from. Suddenly they had a change in persona and said \u201cActually I\u2019m not Brad, I was his roommate Caden and always had a crush on you\u201d \n\nI was even more confused how they got my number as I had never met Caden. I started asking some friends without responding to his messages and I get a text that says \u201cI gotta say you have a nice a** and some nice long hair\u201d I ignored the message. Soon after I found a picture of Caden on an instagram picture with Brad from a month prior to this. I instantly recognized Caden as the receptionist at the hotel I was staying at. I texted the number back saying \u201care you the receptionist that checked me in at my hotel?\u201d \n\nCaden then responded with \u201chaha yea. I recognized you and thought you had a great a** so I got your number off the check in receipt and decided to shoot my shot\u201d I knew this was not okay and I also did not like the fact that he had access to my room if he wanted. I soon got another text \u201cI\u2019m free tonight if you want some company and not the sleeping kind ;)\u201d At this point I was scared he would come into my room and I stayed up all night and left early the next morning.\n\nAs I was driving I called the hotel and spoke to a manager saying I was very uncomfortable with my stay since their worker took my number out of my account and talked about coming to my hotel room to ***. They apologized and said they would take care of it. I recently found out he was fired due to the situation and now all the mutual friends we both have are upset with me for getting him fired from his job.

I mean I work as a receptionist and doing something like that wouldn't even cross my mind in a million years...", "NTA", "Uh NTA. That is creepy and way inappropriate. He shouldn\u2019t be talking to anyone like that, especially customers. And stealing your phone number?? I probably would have called the police and gotten management involved that night!", "NTA", "NTA and this is so far beyond inappropriate!", "I don\u2019t understand why so many people blame the victim because the perpetrator receives appropriate consequences for his or her actions. You did the right thing; he shouldn\u2019t be working with the public until he learns to behave. Your mutual friends sound awful.", "NTA. A guy like that probably does it for a hobby when he can.", "NTA\n\nHe was totally inappropriate and completely out of line. He got himself fired for being a creepy creeper. Anyone that says it's your fault can fuck right hell the off", "Absolutely NTA! He got fired for his inappropriate behavior.", "NTA", "You were a victim of harassment and his behavior was alarming.  I\u2019m sorry it happened thar you felt responsible for even one moment. NTA", "NTA. I know that HIPAA doesn\u2019t apply to this situation, but my work life is run by it and this sets off a bunch of red flags for me. Working in a hotel, you have access to privileged information and guests have to have a certain amount of trust with you to give you that information. This person broke that trust and deserves exactly what he got. And who knows, maybe it\u2019s not the first time it\u2019s happened.", "100% not the asshole! If he was getting your phone number like that, he could easily access other info such as home address or even credit card numbers. The sexual harassment ( and yes, that was definitely harassment) was just the icing on the creep factor cake.", "NTA and creepy as hell if he was my friend and or roommate I would be telling him that he shouldn't sexually harass people if he didn't want to be fired", "Something similar happened me with the cashier at CVS. This is totally not your fault at all he got fired, he got himself fired. Creeps gonna creep, it\u2019s time women started calling out the creeps. Creeps have relied on silence for way to MF long.", "If he was really interested and not a psycho, he should have just introduced himself when he checked you in and asked what's up then. Then maybe friend you on SM later. That was really inappropriate and he knows it.", "NTA. That dude deserves to be fired. That\u2019s super weird behavior", "NTA, that is sexual harrassment, you could have hit him with a car and been in the right", "NTA!!\n\nRecent hotel receptionist here ! Hi \ud83d\udc4b\n\nYeah no! No matter what the conversation was (which was absolutely disgusting and out of line, you need new friends!) He violated policy by texting you PERIOD. IDC what hotel it is, you can't just go into someone's portfolio and access their phone number for personal reasons . \n\nAt my prior job I'd be fired just doing that, wouldn't matter if the message was something totally innocent or totally gross like him. It's against policy and automatic termination where I worked as I'm sure it's close to that at every hotel. \n\nThe ONLY time I was allowed to called a guest is if there was some kind of issue with their payment, deposit return (after their stay!) Or if I had a question about information whatever and that shouldn't even be happening because you should get all of that upon check in so only reason left would be an emergency and a simple knock didn't work, then I'd call and NEVER from my personal phone but from the work phone. A lot of hotels don't have room phones anymore like mine didn't. So thats the only reason I'd ever utilize a guests phone number. \n\nYou need new friends! Whoever is siding with him are just as immature. Younger generation are so entitled and feel like thing like this \"shooting your shot\" isn't a issue. Smh I'm apart of the younger millennials, I know! Unfortunately!", "NTA - I don\u2019t understand people who think texting lewd messages to a girl they don\u2019t even know is gonna get them laid.", "NTA. If he didn\u2019t know something was wrong with it, he wouldn\u2019t have lied about who he was in the first place. Beyond creepy. And I\u2019m willing to bet this wasn\u2019t the first complaint about him.", "He didn\u2019t get fired for flirting with you. He got fired for unethically obtaining customer information to sexually harass you. NTA.", "Definitely NTA. That crossed a huge boundary and is creepy as hell.", "NTA. Anyone who thinks you are in any shape ta here is also an asshole. This man\u2019s behaviour was way out of line and so fucking creepy. You did the right thing. He\u2019s lucky he just lost his job and you didn\u2019t charge him with sexual harassment or something.", "NTA! He was being a creep and even as a man I\u2019d feel totally uncomfortable in my hotel room in that situation. He got himself fired by his actions, you absolutely did what you should have done because people like that need their actions to be called out so they can take some fucking accountability for what they do. \n\nHe wasn\u2019t even brave enough to tell you the truth when texting you! Mitherfucker should\u2019ve shot his shot and the receptionists desk, in person, and get rejected like the rest of us hahaha", "NTA. Total creep and he needed to be fired.", "Men are afraid women will humiliate them. Women are afraid men will murder them. NTA.", "I think in some places, what he did is a crime. He used your personal info given to a business to harass you. He's lucky he ONLY got fired.", "NTA and my I add gross. Complete creepy zone. Ew.", "NTA.  Dude stole your info and then pretended to be someone else.  I (36M) would be creeped out if someone did that to me so I can\u2019t imagine what it would be like to be a lone woman at a hotel in a situation where a creeper has access to your room and personal info.", "NTA. Completely inappropriate. I would\u2019ve immediately called in a manager to report this and to either let them go or get you a new room at a different hotel.", "NTA !", "You're NTA, and I can guarantee that the people in your life saying you are have been lied to by him. I suggest you make a social media post about it, or even screenshot the messages and send them to the flying monkeys.\n\nHe's probably only told them that he flirted with you and you got him fired for it, he wouldn't have told them about pretending to be Brad and stealing your info.", "Nta\n\nNo absolutely not. You are no way the a it was all Caden. Who knows what would have happen if he had gotten any ideas besides harassing you via text. \n\nPlus I doubt he would have been fired for 1 complaint even if it was one like this sadly. Maybe reprimanded but I doubt fired. He probably has had multiple complaints and this was the final strike. any of these so called \u2018friends\u2019 that are upset with you over this aren\u2019t your friends.", "What's the odds that the receptionist at a hotel is friends with a guy from college? And if I understand it correctly, in between somewhere.", "NTA at. ALL. That\u2019s terrifying. I\u2019d want my money back too.", "NTA. That dude is creepy as fuck.", "When you said \u201chitting on,\u201d I did not expect that level of inappropriate creepiness. Fuck that guy. NTA.", "NTA. Dude deserves to be fired. That\u2019s some next-level creepiness.", "NTA\n\nThat crossed so many lines...I just...\n\nThat wasn't even flirting. That was some stalking level shit. That would be terrifying.\n\nThis is where we are as women - a dude stalks and harasses us and we still can be worried about if we were mean to him. \n\nUpset with YOU. Upset with you. JFC - your friends are also AH's.", "NTA. As many others have said, he got himself fired. His behavior was completely unacceptable. I'm sorry that happened to you, and I'm glad you got to your destination safely after your drive.", "NTA and I hope that the hotel refunded your money since they didn\u2019t provide you with a safe place to sleep.", "NTA he was being inappropriate", "Totally NTA he should not be in a position of trust where he has keys to rooms. He had to be fired.", "Definitely NTA! He is gross and that's scary. I'm so sorry you had to deal with that.", "NTA. This is inappropriate and creepy AH. Don\u2019t feel guilty he got fired. HE did it to himself, you did not!", "NTA. Dude was beyond unprofessional. Major case of \u201cjust because you can, doesn\u2019t mean you should\u2026\u201d in regards to accessing your personal data and using it to contact you.", "NTA. You probably aren\u2019t the first person he did this to and THAT is what got him fired.", "When I worked at Jiffy Lube me and my manager made fun of that jiffy lube tech who got caught texting a customer for personal purposes. NotBrad went like, beyond that. \n\nCustomers are supposed to feel safe giving their information and staying on the premises, not have some dude stalk them. \n\nNTA", "NTA Wtf kind of friends agree to that type of behavior?", "Nta. Guys a creeper and seriously could\u2019ve gone into your room while you were sleeping! I would\u2019ve done the same thing.", "You should get those portable door locks and put a glass on the door handle so if anyone opens it. It breaking makes you wake up", "NTA whatsoever. You didn\u2019t get him fired, he got himself fired by being creepy and unprofessional.", "NTA. Act like a clown (and illegal access client info) at work (the send crass text messages) and this is what happens. Give brief description to anyone who doesn\u2019t take your side and offer proof.", "NTA. You might also want to show these \u201cfriends\u201d the screenshots to vindicate yourself.", "I dunno. I would have been calling 911 and the local police as well. What if this nutjob came in and sexually assaulted someone? What if he was on drugs? Drunk? That is the creepiest thing I\u2019ve heard in awhile. Let us know which motel \ud83c\udfe8 chain to not stay at. Frightening.", "YIKES!!! \n\nNTA - this was just totally gross creepy behavior. He got himself fired.", "He didn\u2019t flirt. He violated your privacy, the rules of his job, and common sense! I\u2019ve worked in the resort industry. Flirting is one thing. But to take a  number without consent is just over the top insane. And the fact you didn\u2019t sleep meant you paid for a safe place to sleep and never got it. I\u2019d be pissed if this wasn\u2019t reported. I wonder how many others he pulled this shit on.", "That receptionist didn\u2019t just hit on you.  He lied to you.  He stalked you.

If any of them give you trouble just send them the link to your post. You're NTA bestie. \n\n\n\nCaden's friends, you are not helping him here. You know he fucked up. We know he fucked up. Now Caden needs to know he fucked up. \n\n\nThis is predatory behavior. Leave OP alone. They were completely right to bring this to the management's attention. They didn't get Caden fired. Caden got Caden fired.", "NTA. That creep crossed lines and got what was coming to him", "Oh my goodness, what's wrong with your friends??? This guy sounds rapey and really creepy. You are far from the AH here.", "NTA\n\nJust glad you're safe. And happy you took the time to report this. This is on him not you. Get new friends.", "This is a clear cut NTA.\n\nHe was beyond out of line. You did that hotel a favour by ringing the alarm bell on his behaviour. Tell your mutual friends to pound sand.", "Absolutely NTA and you did the right thing!", "NTA I used to work at an oil change station where information on the person was available. We had a guy who would write the name of girls on a piece of paper and search for them online. Needless to say, he was blacklisted once this was discovered.

You see so many instances of guys getting women's numbers through illegitimate means such as his or her employment, \"flirting\" in this manner (or as you put it, most accurately, \"going full stalker mode\"), she rejects him, and he murders or assaults her. I mean, in and of itself this should meet the definition of assault as it is most often defined in similar terms as in this excerpt: \"Assault refers to\u00a0the wrong act of causing someone to reasonably fear imminent harm.\"", "Criminal - consult a lawyer. You have the texts from his private phone.", "You're so right. Flirting would have been the smiles and winks at check-in.

She worked at a hotel, a new guy started and would keep harassing her to the point where he\u2019d comment how he wanted to push her up against the wall [explicit content].

You told his employer what he did, and *they*  decided to fire him. If his actions were so okay, his employer wouldn't have felt the need to let him go.

He knew exactly what he was doing, and so does everyone else. Those people *are not* your friends", "It\u2019s a creative way to get your attention because unlike other ways to shoot his shot, he did it in a way to make you fear for your safety. NTA and Caden is a creep. I\u2019m sorry you have such shitty friends.", "Hold up, those people downplayed the seriousness of his creepy, stalkerish, sexual harassing BS? I doubt they would feel honored to get random texts from someone pretending to be someone else until they\u2019re called out, who then inquires about sex.
