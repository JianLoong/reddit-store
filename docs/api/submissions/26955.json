He goes radio silent and punishes her by ignoring her for a day or two, racking up the 'omg I did something wrong feelings' in her until she's apologising.\n\nEither way, she'll eventually learn, going against his wishes end with her being miserable and anxious and embarrassed. And she'll start just doing what he wants to save herself those feelings. \n\nOP says the relationship is super new, and hopefully this will be a wake up call for her, but I can't help but think the first incident should have been a wake up call, and the fact that he managed to twist her around until she's apologising is extremely worrying and shows how good he is at manipulation and how deep his claws already are. \n\nOP doesn't seem appropriately worried about this imo.", "there\u2019s something about coconut rice that hits", "Update us when she kicks him to the curb! \n\n(To that end, maybe some time after your birthday dinner (maybe in a letter?) gently point out that she's aware his behavior was inappropriate and how he treated her--leaving, berating her--makes you uncomfortable because she deserves to be treated with respect even when he's upset.)", "I was in an abusive relationship for 5 years. They're very complex and it can take a long time to \"wake up\". The best, and only thing you can do as a parent is never say a bad word against him, or let your daughter know you don't like him. That way, when she leaves him, she'll feel like she can come to you for support.", "I would suggest meeting up with Jenifer separately and mentioning that you've noticed some concerning behaviour from her new boyfriend, and you want to make sure she's OK, and that she knows that what happened at the house at dinner was not her fault. Remind her that she is loved and cared for and that sometimes, when we like someone, we don't see the red flags. \n\nI would then tell her that you find his behaviour alarming, but she's obviously an adult, and she can date whoever she wants. Promise not to mention it again, and remind her you just love her and want her to be happy with a loving partner who respects her.\n\nObviously, OP can't stop her from seeing this guy. And going too hard is just going to push her towards him, but just sitting by with a 'ehhh I'm sure this will all work itself out' mindset is dangerous. No parent wants to believe *their* child is capable of being manipulated by an abuser until they don't know which way is up, but it can happen to anyone, and it happens QUICK.", "i put coconut rice with all kinds of meals that probably should just have white rice, used to drive my partner mad but she's come around to it lol", ">going too hard is just going to push her towards him\n\nWhich is why I asked that question.\n\nGood advice!"]}
