Shauna immediately hired her as a nanny and I was really happy for them as Bianca found work with a good family and Shauna had the help she needed.

Bianca told me she'd be available by the first of February, I asked about Shauna and she said the work was too demanding taking care of her daughter plus chores around the house concerning her other five kids.

But I think you and your cousin are thinking human are ressources, not human. \n\nBecause you're more upset about the fact, that she 'lied' to you, and put you in a bad position. And you didn't think, she could handle your kids. \n\nClearly your cousin is a really bad boss. But are you really much better? \n\nIf you want, that she is staying with you, you have to learn her loyalty. \n\nGood luck!", "NTA\n\nBianca is self-employed and this is her choice to work for you. If Bianca quits, then that's her choice.\n\nShauna and your family need to realize that Bianca is an adult and made this decision on her own. If a better offer comes along, then Bianca will pick it.", "Your family want you to \"let\" Shauna hire Bianca again? She's a human being, you can't just pass her around without her consent. Good on you for listening to Bianca about what she wants. NTA", "NTA But I think you should let go of Bianca. She could do the same to you and leave you in a bind. Plus it would get you out of the family drama.", "NTA. Bianca is not an object to be passed around.\nNow if you're feeling magnanimous and if Bianca is willing, you, Bianca and Shauna can sit down and discuss a transition plan with very strict boundaries about what work Bianca might be willing to do for Shauna to help while she identifies a replacement,  and perhaps provide an almost exit-interview for Bianca to share constructively some of the things that led to her leaving Shauna's employment that Shauna can then use to help her attract and retain a new employee. \nAll of that would depend on how mature Shauna would be willing to be and if Bianca is willing to compromise that way.\n\nThe rest of your family can butt right out, unless any of them would prefer to volunteer time to help out Shauna.", "NTA. It isn\u2019t your responsibility imo to tell Shauna anything it was on Bianca. I don\u2019t see why you should have to fire her because Shauna wants her back when the work is too much for her and she doesn\u2019t want to do it. Shauna just needs to find someone else to employ and I hope she can stop the emotional blackmail and harassment.", "NTA  \nYou didn't set out to steal her, and really, how do you steal a person? It's not like you kidnapped her or put her in your purse or your luggage while you were there... The fact that a potential pay increase of roughly 25% isn't even making an impression on her, is soooo telling  \nBasically you untentionally gave her a lifeline, she was going to leave Shauna's employ sooner rather than later anyway", "NTA, bianca is not shaunas property and maybe if she hadn\u2019t been dumping more on her than should have she\u2019d still be working for her, the fact is trying to blackmail you and bianca says it all and like bianca has said, she wouldn\u2019t work for her again even if you did fire her!\n\nTell Shauna to grow up and quit the emotional blackmail, tell your SIL/narky relations that NC is always an option and if they refuse to see what Shauna is doing that\u2019s on them! Maybe point out that Bianca isn\u2019t a used car to pass around, SHE decided to leave, Shauna made it impossible for her to do it nicely, simples!\n\nI will say though if let her go because were iffy on her childcare skills, why did you hire her \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "You\u2019re all aware Bianca isn\u2019t property you can all pass around, right? She doesn\u2019t want to work for your cousin and shouldn\u2019t be forced to. If you\u2019re happy with her work, you hired her fairly. Tell the rest to eff off.", "NTA\n\nBianca is not going back there, regardless if you fire her.", "NTA \n\nShauna does not own Bianca.\n\nYou did not steal Bianca. Bianca is a free agent. Bianca did not want to work for Shauna anymore. She would have left anyway, since she didn't like the job.\n\nYou didn't know the situation between Bianca and Shauna and it really wasn't any of your business.", "NTA, I think Bianca should have ultimately been more firm with Shauna and Shauna should have accepted her resignation the first time and tried to work out an arrangement with Bianca that gave her time to find someone else. I understand Shauna\u2019s desperation, however, and it\u2019s not surprising she\u2019s lashing out. I would just explain that you didn\u2019t know what was going on with her and Bianca and then give her space. \n\nAll your relatives saying you should fire Bianca so she will work for Shauna again are treating her like a commodity, rather than a human that can chose where and how she works and that is really gross. Do not fire Bianca over this.", "NTA, Bianca is her own person and she can decide which jobs she takes. Or not.  It sounds like Shauna was not easy to work for, so when presented an opportunity Bianca dipped.  You just happened to be the new opportunity.", "ESH\n\nYou didn't steal Bianca from your cousin. She didn't want to work for her anymore. You could have maybe asked her about it?\n\nBianca should have quit like a big girl.\n\nYou shouldn't be angry at Bianca for putting you in a position, you had a phone you could have called Shauna. Shauna should be annoyed at Bianca for not giving notice.\n\nShauna seems like an unpleasant person, probably why Bianca was afraid or didn't care to give notice. She shouldn't be calling people and yelling at them. She shouldn't be begging someone to work for her to care for _her children_ that doesn't want to.", "NTA - you didn't \"steal\" Bianca, you asked her if she knew anyone needing work. She says she's wanted to leave your cousin's employment for some time, so chances are she would have gone sooner or later anyway.\n\n\"stealing\" her would imply you'd contacted her and gone \"Hey, come work for me again and I will pay you more money\" as your cousin seems to be trying to do", "NTA - You could've checked in with Shauna, but at the end of the day Bianca is her own person and she doesn't want to work for Shauna and that's all that matters.", "NTA. Bianca is a human being with her own thoughts, wants and needs, not some child care robot. She obviously doesn't want to work for Shauna, and who is to say that she would even if you did let her go. Sucks for Shauna but Bianca has made up her mind.", "Your family seem to think that Bianca is more commodity than human. Do they not realise that your firing her wouldn\u2019t result in her suddenly wanting to work for Shauna again?\n\nAlso, you\u2019ve mentioned that Shauna isn\u2019t aggressive or unpleasant, but even if it stems from desperation, her behaviour is certainly aggressive and unpleasant.", "Why would OP ask for a reference if she was satisfied with Bianca's previous work and even said she would contact Bianca if she ever needed help again?", "I was skeptical cause I had originally just hired Bianca as a maid and she even had admitted that she didn't like cleaning up after kids. Shauna's daughter obviously needed to be fed, had a strict medication schedule, plus regular diaper change something Bianca never did for me as my four year is potty trained that's why I told Shauna that. It turned out to be true cause Bianca couldn't handle it all plus doing odd jobs like laundry and dish washing for Shauna. To put it into perspective dishwashing for me is a ten to fifteen minutes task as we're a small family, at Shauna's place there's an entire system as it's constant throughout the day.", "Shauna is not letting up and even saying she'll come to talk to Bianca. She says it'll take her a long time to retrain another maid and Bianca just stay two more months with her while she finds a suitable replacement. My family is saying that I should think of her daughter and just let Bianca go, as they feel I'm the only thing stopping her from going back.", "To her credit, Shauna isn't being rude or aggressive just extremely desperate it really saddens me and honestly I feel all the stress isn't worth it at times. She even called Bianca's mom begging her to convince her and it all seems too much for the both of us. I feel it would be better if Bianca left and I found someone else. It's up to her who she wants to work with even if it's some stranger but I don't think that'll stop Shauna though but at least I'll be out of the situation.", "So why does OP suck?", "Shauna isn't an unpleasant person, it's just she needs someone extremely responsible and Bianca is that. I think the stress of taking care of her daughter has got to her plus she has a really big family. Shauna I feel really needs help as seeing her like is honestly heartbreaking and why I do feel like a crummy person but I honestly did think Bianca quit the normal way but she says everytime she'd bring it up Shauna would cry and beg not to quit.", "Most of my family members think I should fire her to keep the peace. Basically it's better a stranger hires than us ruining our relationship over her while Shauna has assured me she won't hold any grudges over me or fight with me over Bianca but then would ask me to support her and convince Bianca to come back. So honestly I have no idea what do here.", "I feel Shauna needs professional help as this isn't her regular behaviour. I haven't been much in touch with her since the birth of her twins but taking care of her daughter has clearly taken a toll on her.", "\"I was skeptical of how Bianca was with kids.\" Just drawing from OP's own words.", "Your cousin needs to back off. Repeated calls to Bianca and Bianca's mother is harassment.  Bianca has every right to seek a restraining order against Shauna at this rate, which won't help anyone.", "NTA. Protect Bianca from Shauna.  If you do decide to let her go make certain she has a better job away from your family.", "Does Bianca want to go back? That\u2019s the only important answer. No one else matters. Your cousin and her problems don\u2019t matter. Your family sucks. They are acting like she\u2019s property. They can think what they want but they\u2019re wrong. And AHs to boot. Your cousin is a major AH.", "None of this is making any sense. Are you and your sister the only people in a twenty-mile radius with job listings? Why does Bianca have no choice other than you or Shauna? Has your family trafficked her or something? Even if you fire her, why would she work for Shauna again?", "Shauna is acting in an absolutely disgusting manner, whether it\u2019s out of desperation or not. Bianca tried to resign and needs another job, you admit she\u2019s good at her job as well. It would be very unfair of you to fire her just because Shauna doesn\u2019t know how to behave or treat employees properly.", "For not communicating and being angry at Bianca", "Your cousin is extremely manipulative.", "That's sad I'm sorry OP. She shouldn't have cried and begged someone not to quit. I hope she can find some resources to help her", "If Bianca works for your needs and her work is good, keep her. Bianca doesn't want to work for your cousin for any amount of money. Why would you give up someone who you trust? It's not easy to find someone to care for your home and children who you can trust. Your cousin will get over it. \n\nI would encourage Bianca to communicate with your cousin and tell why the job didn't work for her and she wouldn't go back even if she left you.\n\nShauna is manipulative and seems to think she owns Bianca. It's disgusting.", "Bianca's mom and sister's want her to go back and have been trying to convince her mostly because of the pay raise. They're basically saying she should work the two months as Shauna requested then quit the proper way. I've already told her the day she wants to quit she's free to leave. It's like a ticking time bomb of sorts cause I honestly love the help and am happy I have someone I can depend on wathcing over my kids while I'm at work at the same time with all this family drama I don't think it's worth it.", "That's what most of my family is saying that I should let Bianca go and find someone else cause better some stranger hires her than both of us fighting over her. Bianca definitely doesn't want to go back to Shauna but she feels happy with me as she hasn't had good experiences with other families apparently some don't provide food or others treat maids rudely. This type of behaviour isn't a thing in our family that's why she was happy to work with Shauna after I let her go thinking it would be similar to working with me.", "She tried to quit the proper way before and look what happened. I can\u2019t believe Bianca\u2019s family, your family, and now you all want to punish this girl because Shauna is an unhinged employer who won\u2019t take a resignation without resorting to emotionally terrorizing this poor girl. Shame on every single one of you, barring Bianca.", "Hey I agree with you. It's getting tiring constantly talking about this with Bianca plus the thought of Shauna coming by to talk to Bianca is causing me major stress. I can only imagine how Bianca feels about it. I even told my husband I think she should just find work elsewhere cause this is getting out of hand.", "No, she should not have to find work elsewhere because your cousin is an unhinged psycho. You should both block Shauna\u2019s number if it\u2019s becoming this much of an issue. Tell your family you will no longer discuss it and they\u2019ll be getting blocked for the time being as well if they keep it up."]}
