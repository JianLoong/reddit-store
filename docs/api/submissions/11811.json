But are you really much better? \n\nIf you want, that she is staying with you, you have to learn her loyalty. \n\nGood luck!", "NTA\n\nBianca is self-employed and this is her choice to work for you. If Bianca quits, then that's her choice.\n\nShauna and your family need to realize that Bianca is an adult and made this decision on her own. If a better offer comes along, then Bianca will pick it.", "Your family want you to \"let\" Shauna hire Bianca again? She's a human being, you can't just pass her around without her consent. Good on you for listening to Bianca about what she wants. NTA", "NTA But I think you should let go of Bianca. She could do the same to you and leave you in a bind. Plus it would get you out of the family drama.", "NTA. Bianca is not an object to be passed around.\nNow if you're feeling magnanimous and if Bianca is willing, you, Bianca and Shauna can sit down and discuss a transition plan with very strict boundaries about what work Bianca might be willing to do for Shauna to help while she identifies a replacement,  and perhaps provide an almost exit-interview for Bianca to share constructively some of the things that led to her leaving Shauna's employment that Shauna can then use to help her attract and retain a new employee. \nAll of that would depend on how mature Shauna would be willing to be and if Bianca is willing to compromise that way.\n\nThe rest of your family can butt right out, unless any of them would prefer to volunteer time to help out Shauna.", "NTA. It isn\u2019t your responsibility imo to tell Shauna anything it was on Bianca. I don\u2019t see why you should have to fire her because Shauna wants her back when the work is too much for her and she doesn\u2019t want to do it. Shauna just needs to find someone else to employ and I hope she can stop the emotional blackmail and harassment.", "NTA  \nYou didn't set out to steal her, and really, how do you steal a person? It's not like you kidnapped her or put her in your purse or your luggage while you were there... The fact that a potential pay increase of roughly 25% isn't even making an impression on her, is soooo telling  \nBasically you untentionally gave her a lifeline, she was going to leave Shauna's employ sooner rather than later anyway", "NTA, bianca is not shaunas property and maybe if she hadn\u2019t been dumping more on her than should have she\u2019d still be working for her, the fact is trying to blackmail you and bianca says it all and like bianca has said, she wouldn\u2019t work for her again even if you did fire her!\n\nTell Shauna to grow up and quit the emotional blackmail, tell your SIL/narky relations that NC is always an option and if they refuse to see what Shauna is doing that\u2019s on them! Maybe point out that Bianca isn\u2019t a used car to pass around, SHE decided to leave, Shauna made it impossible for her to do it nicely, simples!\n\nI will say though if let her go because were iffy on her childcare skills, why did you hire her \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "You\u2019re all aware Bianca isn\u2019t property you can all pass around, right?

Tell the rest to eff off.", "NTA\n\nBianca is not going back there, regardless if you fire her.", "NTA \n\nShauna does not own Bianca.\n\nYou did not steal Bianca. Bianca is a free agent. Bianca did not want to work for Shauna anymore. She would have left anyway, since she didn't like the job.\n\nYou didn't know the situation between Bianca and Shauna and it really wasn't any of your business.", "NTA, I think Bianca should have ultimately been more firm with Shauna and Shauna should have accepted her resignation the first time and tried to work out an arrangement with Bianca that gave her time to find someone else. I understand Shauna\u2019s desperation, however, and it\u2019s not surprising she\u2019s lashing out. I would just explain that you didn\u2019t know what was going on with her and Bianca and then give her space. \n\nAll your relatives saying you should fire Bianca so she will work for Shauna again are treating her like a commodity, rather than a human that can chose where and how she works and that is really gross. Do not fire Bianca over this.", "NTA, Bianca is her own person and she can decide which jobs she takes. Or not.  It sounds like Shauna was not easy to work for, so when presented an opportunity Bianca dipped.  You just happened to be the new opportunity.", "ESH\n\nYou didn't steal Bianca from your cousin. She didn't want to work for her anymore. You could have maybe asked her about it?\n\nBianca should have quit like a big girl.\n\nYou shouldn't be angry at Bianca for putting you in a position, you had a phone you could have called Shauna. Shauna should be annoyed at Bianca for not giving notice.\n\nShauna seems like an unpleasant person, probably why Bianca was afraid or didn't care to give notice. She shouldn't be calling people and yelling at them. She shouldn't be begging someone to work for her to care for _her children_ that doesn't want to.", "NTA - you didn't \"steal\" Bianca, you asked her if she knew anyone needing work.

Bianca is a human being with her own thoughts, wants and needs, not some child care robot. She obviously doesn't want to work for Shauna, and who is to say that she would even if you did let her go. Sucks for Shauna but Bianca has made up her mind.", "Your family seem to think that Bianca is more commodity than human. Do they not realise that your firing her wouldn\u2019t result in her suddenly wanting to work for Shauna again?\n\nAlso, you\u2019ve mentioned that Shauna isn\u2019t aggressive or unpleasant, but even if it stems from desperation, her behaviour is certainly aggressive and unpleasant.", "Why would OP ask for a reference if she was satisfied with Bianca's previous work and even said she would contact Bianca if she ever needed help again?", "I was skeptical cause I had originally just hired Bianca as a maid and she even had admitted that she didn't like cleaning up after kids. Shauna's daughter obviously needed to be fed, had a strict medication schedule, plus regular diaper change something Bianca never did for me as my four year is potty trained that's why I told Shauna that. It turned out to be true cause Bianca couldn't handle it all plus doing odd jobs like laundry and dish washing for Shauna. To put it into perspective dishwashing for me is a ten to fifteen minutes task as we're a small family, at Shauna's place there's an entire system as it's constant throughout the day.", "Shauna is not letting up and even saying she'll come to talk to Bianca. She says it'll take her a long time to retrain another maid and Bianca just stay two more months with her while she finds a suitable replacement. My family is saying that I should think of her daughter and just let Bianca go, as they feel I'm the only thing stopping her from going back.", "To her credit, Shauna isn't being rude or aggressive just extremely desperate it really saddens me and honestly I feel all the stress isn't worth it at times. She even called Bianca's mom begging her to convince her and it all seems too much for the both of us. I feel it would be better if Bianca left and I found someone else. It's up to her who she wants to work with even if it's some stranger but I don't think that'll stop Shauna though but at least I'll be out of the situation.", "So why does OP suck?", "Shauna isn't an unpleasant person, it's just she needs someone extremely responsible and Bianca is that. I think the stress of taking care of her daughter has got to her plus she has a really big family. Shauna I feel really needs help as seeing her like is honestly heartbreaking and why I do feel like a crummy person but I honestly did think Bianca quit the normal way but she says everytime she'd bring it up Shauna would cry and beg not to quit.", "Most of my family members think I should fire her to keep the peace. Basically it's better a stranger hires than us ruining our relationship over her while Shauna has assured me she won't hold any grudges over me or fight with me over Bianca but then would ask me to support her and convince Bianca to come back. So honestly I have no idea what do here.", "I feel Shauna needs professional help as this isn't her regular behaviour. I haven't been much in touch with her since the birth of her twins but taking care of her daughter has clearly taken a toll on her.", "\"I was skeptical of how Bianca was with kids.\" Just drawing from OP's own words.", "Your cousin needs to back off. Repeated calls to Bianca and Bianca's mother is harassment.  Bianca has every right to seek a restraining order against Shauna at this rate, which won't help anyone.", "NTA. Protect Bianca from Shauna.  If you do decide to let her go make certain she has a better job away from your family.", "Does Bianca want to go back? That\u2019s the only important answer. No one else matters. Your cousin and her problems don\u2019t matter. Your family sucks. They are acting like she\u2019s property. They can think what they want but they\u2019re wrong. And AHs to boot. Your cousin is a major AH.", "None of this is making any sense. Are you and your sister the only people in a twenty-mile radius with job listings? Why does Bianca have no choice other than you or Shauna? Has your family trafficked her or something? Even if you fire her, why would she work for Shauna again?", "Shauna is acting in an absolutely disgusting manner, whether it\u2019s out of desperation or not. Bianca tried to resign and needs another job, you admit she\u2019s good at her job as well. It would be very unfair of you to fire her just because Shauna doesn\u2019t know how to behave or treat employees properly.", "For not communicating and being angry at Bianca", "Your cousin is extremely manipulative.", "That's sad I'm sorry OP. She shouldn't have cried and begged someone not to quit. I hope she can find some resources to help her", "If Bianca works for your needs and her work is good, keep her. Bianca doesn't want to work for your cousin for any amount of money. Why would you give up someone who you trust? It's not easy to find someone to care for your home and children who you can trust. Your cousin will get over it. \n\nI would encourage Bianca to communicate with your cousin and tell why the job didn't work for her and she wouldn't go back even if she left you.\n\nShauna is manipulative and seems to think she owns Bianca. It's disgusting.", "Bianca's mom and sister's want her to go back and have been trying to convince her mostly because of the pay raise. They're basically saying she should work the two months as Shauna requested then quit the proper way. I've already told her the day she wants to quit she's free to leave. It's like a ticking time bomb of sorts cause I honestly love the help and am happy I have someone I can depend on wathcing over my kids while I'm at work at the same time with all this family drama I don't think it's worth it.", "That's what most of my family is saying that I should let Bianca go and find someone else cause better some stranger hires her than both of us fighting over her. Bianca definitely doesn't want to go back to Shauna but she feels happy with me as she hasn't had good experiences with other families apparently some don't provide food or others treat maids rudely. This type of behaviour isn't a thing in our family that's why she was happy to work with Shauna after I let her go thinking it would be similar to working with me.", "She tried to quit the proper way before and look what happened. I can\u2019t believe Bianca\u2019s family, your family, and now you all want to punish this girl because Shauna is an unhinged employer who won\u2019t take a resignation without resorting to emotionally terrorizing this poor girl. Shame on every single one of you, barring Bianca.", "Hey I agree with you. It's getting tiring constantly talking about this with Bianca plus the thought of Shauna coming by to talk to Bianca is causing me major stress. I can only imagine how Bianca feels about it. I even told my husband I think she should just find work elsewhere cause this is getting out of hand.", "No, she should not have to find work elsewhere because your cousin is an unhinged psycho. You should both block Shauna\u2019s number if it\u2019s becoming this much of an issue. Tell your family you will no longer discuss it and they\u2019ll be getting blocked for the time being as well if they keep it up.", "Bianca is not a favorite Barbie doll or a roller skate.

No wonder she wasn't happy & wanted to change families.\n\nSounds like Shauna needs 2 people, a nanny/carer for her special needs daughter & maybe a PT/FT maid for keeping up with a family of six children and presumably 2 adults.", "You can't steal Bianca since Bianca is not an item. She choose to work for you of her own free will. Your cousin need to think long about what made Bianca want to quit and not blaming you for hiring someone who is willing. NTA", "NTA. Honestly, the care for a child with CP and epilepsy is likely a one person job, and possibly more for someone like a CNA. Shauna wanted Bianca to do all of that plus be a housekeeper? No wonder she doesn\u2019t want to work there. \n\nShauna\u2019s situation isn\u2019t great but I think she knows that it will be very hard to find someone else to agree to be both a caregiver to a child with extra needs and also handle housekeeping. It\u2019s just not a reasonable ask, which is why she\u2019s desperate to get Bianca back. Most people with relevant experience would say hell no, I think.", "NTA. You can't \"steal\" a person and you likewise can't \"give them back.\" Even if you fired Bianca, it doesn't sound like she'd go back to Shauna anyway.", "NTA\n\nShauna and anyone else in your family saying to fire Bianca so she'll have no choice but to go back to Shauna are disgusting. Bianca can choose who she wants to work for. She has already tried working for Shauna and found the workload was too much. The child with special needs probably requires a high level of care and with five other children, plus housekeeping, that's understandable. Even if you were to fire her, she would likely not go back to working for Shauna--she'd just find employment elsewhere, and then you'd both be out a good nanny.", "Nta. Bianca is a human being that gets to decide for herself who she wants to work for. You and your cousin don't get to decide who gets to \"have\" her. She isn't a toy.\n\nBianca decided she preferred to work for you as it is easier to care for 3 children as opposed to 6 (include one that is severely disabled).

NO.", "NTA", "YTA for being mad at Bianca who had to ghost your psycho cousin to physically escape what sounds like an exploitative situation. How is it Bianca's fault that she quit and your cousin refused to accept her new reality? You're in an uncomfortable situation because Shawna's an asshole.

Your cousin is unhinged.", "NTA but I would be prepared for when she no shows you one day because she got a better offer.", "NTA, but your cousin is an AH and yes, even Bianca is a little teeny bit.\n\nShauna shouldn't have turned this into a drama, and shouldn't have tried to coerce Bianca into staying or you into firing her. She's struggling, but Bianca isn't her personal property or on earth for her exclusive use - she can hire someone else, or multiple someone elses if she can afford it. Or hey! Some of the concerned family could go support her!\n\nBianca is blameless for wanting to get out of a bad work situation, but should have given you a head's up that her parting with Shauna was a rough one - not in the sense that she owes you details, and I understand she probably thought you wouldn't hire her, but in the sense that she knew drama was coming and put you in a bad position to handle it.\n\nEveryone piling in are AHs for feeding the Shauna-beast.", "NTA Bianca needs to block her.", "ESH except Bianca. Your cousin needs some serious help if she's acting this unhinged over losing childcare. But you're also equally shitty for putting the blame on Bianca. If she has tried quitting and Shauna continues to EMOTIONALLY MANIPULATE her into staying, that's not Bianca's fault. That you even blamed her is insane.", "NTA for rehiring Bianca, but I\u2019m extremely uncomfortable about how you and your family are talking about Bianca like she\u2019s not an autonomous person who can take and leave jobs as she pleases. Please stop that.", "what a surprise, rich people thinking they own their servants. i vote ESH on principle", "NTA \n\n But you need to go ahead and send out a mass text letting everyone know that cousing was taking advantage of nanny, by having her do a job meant for a cna, while also trying to have her be a housekeeper. \n\nThat cousin was severely underpaying the nanny and that regardless of whether or not you fire her. The nanny has decided on her own not to work for cousin again.\n\nYou did not steal nanny from anyone and she made a conscious decision to quit becaise cousin was abusing her help and she chose to work for you and has asked  to work for you. \n\nThat the nanny has made it clear that cousin was abusing her and under paying and putting too many responsibilities on her. And that if op fires her, then she will not be going back to cousin.

That if you fire her, nanny has made it clear that she will just go work for another family.", "NTA.  But perhaps OP can help find a suitable nanny for the cousin - one more able to deal with the situation.", "NTA\n\nSounds like Shauna is a controlling asshole even though she is also a desperate mother. You can't force someone to work for you if they don't want to! You didn't approach Bianca asking to hire her back. You asked her for a referral. Instead she jumped at the possibility of working for you again. Shauna needs to knock it off and find someone else. It sounds like she thinks you can guilt someone into being a nanny for them. I think Bianca doesn't want to work for her no matter what the pay, which is sad, but not your problem and honestly it's not Bianca's problem either.", "NTA because when it comes down to it, it's not up to any of you. Bianca is a human being who makes her own decisions and if she doesn't feel comfortable working for Shauna then your cousin needs to find someone more qualified who will and can help her. You didn't steal Bianca, she's a person who chose for herself. She should have told Shauna but it sounds like she wasn't really being heard either way.

Check in on her, person to person, and knock some sense into your family.", "OP seems to have no concern for how egregiously Shauna was overworking Bianca.", "As a former special needs caregiver for children, I feel for Bianca here because she's in a situation I was in many times. If I am hired to care for a high needs child, I will care for your child and do light cleaning *related to childcare.* (I will clean messes they make, dishes after meals, tub after the bath, ect.) \n\nSO MANY parents expect a nanny AND a housekeeper AND a babysitter for healthy children with wildly different needs, who also does their laundry and a full maid service, and its often not possible to safely care for the high needs child- who is usually less mobile- while also doing laundry and mopping floors and trying to keep track of a toddler who is fully mobile and doesn't want to stay in the same room as the disabled sibling. \n\nThere are FOUR other children in that home that she's expected to clean while also caring for a special needs child. Of course she went back to the job that requires her to only do one job (as OP said she does most childcare and just needs a person at home)! A twenty five percent raise isn't enough pay to be doing the work of two (or even three) people. I left a few jobs over this. The new job was not the reason. \n\nI know special needs parents get a raw deal, but your employees are still people and they are not obligated to burn themselves at your alter just because you are struggling for resources and assistance. If you need a babysitter for your four neurotypical kids, a special needs nanny, and a maid, you need three people. If you hire one person, it will be a person desperate for work, and they either will not last or not care for your child safely..", "We live outside the US. Bianca is an immigrant in my country and they tend to be mistreated so finding good employers is really hard plus there's always the fear of being deported.", "Everyone except Bianca, who has been desperately trying to leave working for Shauna and took the first exit she could, even with a 25% pay cut.", "Not in the USA", "Well now you\u2019re assuming OP *wants* to treat Bianca with dignity. As opposed to simply treating her like a dramatic inconvenience despite knowing she\u2019s being harassed and poorly treated, as OP has illustrated.", "It sounds like they've trafficked her. Or that she's basically a slave. I'm concerned for Bianca and would like to know what country OP is in and where Bianca is from.", "Yeah cool doesn\u2019t excuse harassing or mistreating someone she employs and it certainly doesn\u2019t explain you acting like the drama is Bianca\u2019s fault", "NTA. Shauna does have problems which are not yours or Bianca's. Ignore your relatives, Bianca quit on her own.", "She\u2019s being very aggressive in her harassment of this woman. And it crossed into rudeness the first time she didn\u2019t accept Bianca\u2019s resignation, if not before.", "Is your cousin the type who will threaten Bianca\u2019s immigration status if she doesn\u2019t come back?", "Wow,\nI hate it.\n\n\n\nYou\u2019re all assholes. Everyone except Bianca.", "Sounds unpleasant to me. Maybe you should go help shauna.", "Thank you for calling her a woman. OP called her a \u201cyoung girl\u201d and that irked me from the get go.", "Well, it sounds like they had her taking care of a disabled child plus FIVE other kids! Bianca cut the number of kids she has to care for in half by switching jobs.", "exactly, this reads VERY south america to me, but of course I could be wrong", "Oh FFS Reddit. No she gets paid. She left one job for another and now is changing again. She\u2019s not a slave. \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Plush her 6 kids and all of the housework", "Also she can\u2019t \u201csend her back\u201d\n\nYou can\u2019t ship humans around, they\u2019re not property.", "The heck is your issue? Bianca isn\u2019t a problem. Shauna is. Why do you\nInsist on \u201cfighting over\u201d Bianca? Set some boundaries with your cousin.", "A \"chocolate\" pie", "Just like the one Minnie made for Miss Hilly!", "> Bianca told me she'd be available by the first of February, I asked about Shauna and she said the work was too demanding taking care of her daughter plus chores around the house concerning her other five kids\n\nSounds like Bianca told OP everything she needed to know.", "With that good vanilla from Mexico?", "Yeah it\u2019s not like you can advocate for her and set some boundaries around Shauna\u2019s unhinged behavior right better just tell Bianca she\u2019s the problem and send her off \n\nYou\u2019re an AH", "You don\u2019t have to let shauna in. You know that, right?", "How is OP not taking Bianca's feelings into consideration? She literally asked what Bianca wanted to do, which was to stay employed with OP. And OP is continuing to employ her, despite getting constant harassment from her family. OP is pitting herself against her own family to protect Bianca when it would be easier to just fire her.\n\nSomeone who doesn't value Bianca as human wouldn't deal with the drama. OP can always find another maid. She let Bianca choose what she wanted to do, and OP is facing the consequences for Bianca's choice. OP is not an asshole for explaining how she is being inconvenienced for her solidarity. \n\nEveryone is forgetting that the title is \"AITA for hiring my cousin's nanny that she hired for her disabled child.\" She is absolutely NTA for protecting Bianca's best interest, full stop. Feel however you want about the way she talks about the situation, but actions speak louder than words and OP is actually doing something to help Bianca.", "I mean. I've been sleep-deprived enough in my life to contemplate some pretty unhinged stuff. So I can have *some* empathy for a parent of 6-7 kids (why tho) who just didn't expect the sheer chaos a severely disabled child can bring into your life.\n\nBut. **Holy crap** why is the entire family acting like this is just normal? Why is OP even talking through this with anyone? *I'm so sick of talking about this* so freaking stop it! Nothing to talk about. Yeesh.\n\n\"Shauna, this is not OK and I'll be calling the authorities to get you some help if you're so damn desperate.\"\n\n\"Bianca, I'm so sorry for not protecting you better, but from now on this topic is closed. You have no responsibility to Shauna and I've instructed her to stay away from you and stop contacting either of us.\"", "TRUTH!"]}
