It's A MEN'S ROOM!!  Expect to see MEN!  And, if the ones waiting, don't like it, they can use the ladies' room, and stfu. So much for equal rights!

You, a MALE, went into the MEN'S loo to find a WOMAN having a go at you for being in YOUR place? \n\nI know this world is supposed to be gender neutral/equality etc. but that's ridiculous! I'm with you 100%!", "NTA\nIt's the men's room. They made no indication that there was a line for it. However you do not have to wait in line if the urinal is free. To expect someone to hold their pee in so your can pee is ridiculous. Don't use the men's room if you don't like seeing men use it smh.", "I have a perspective here courtesy my sister. The lines at the women\u2019s washroom are truly long af. My sister was waiting for so long that she couldnt hold it any longer and literally ran into the men\u2019s.

This also relies on the urinal being the right height and shape, and the strength of the grouting!", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\udca6"]}
