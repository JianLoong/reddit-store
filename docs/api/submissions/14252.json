Dude did nothing wrong, she's just not dealing with the cognitive dissonance she brought upon herself", "I\u2019m a lady who uses the men\u2019s room at stadiums and bars and whenever there\u2019s a huge line for the women\u2019s bathroom. If there are no men waiting for the stalls, I\u2019ll sneak in for a quick pee.

Men should have priority, as it is the mens room.", "I'm so confused. Why would the women waiting in line be mad at you? How did you cut them off?

When it's only men in line for the men's room it's customary for the line for the urinal to follow way faster than the line for the stalls. That doesn't change just because women want to use the men's room as well.", "Nope. I thought it was understood that the gender noted on the door of the restroom automatically has preference over anyone else waiting. I only used the men\u2019s room when desperate and when there were no men around. (Only in bars \u2026 I would never use the men\u2019s room in any other circumstance.).

I (55F) went to a bar that was having a gay new years party(94) and since it was a 99% male crowd both bathrooms became men's room but when I got in line they told me to go first since it was the ladies room.  Other times when the women's room has a stupid long line and the men's is empty I'll go into the men's.  I remember at the DooDah parade the staging area ladies bathrooms were crazy.  I went to the mens,  said \" close your eyes, lady coming thru!\" and laughed when some of them did and then said wait, what and laughed.  Weirdly the only people who got mad were a couple old biddies in the ladies line.", "Short answer, no you didn't do a bad thing.\n\nLong answer, the first woman was just straight up being ridiculous, because the only privacy she should expect in a public or business' lavatory is the one that comes with a cubical and a latch. If that's what slowing these women up at the women's room, the idea that there should only ever be one person in these bathrooms, than they have more problems than what clearly is the main one. I don't think this is the case, she's just being foolish. She should also expect to see a dude unzipping in the **men's room.**\n\nThe women in the line up are clearly just envious because they've been waiting upwards of 5-10 minutes, desperately need to go because they been drinking, and they just watched a dude walk past them and return 20 seconds later give or take a few based off movement and unbuckling/rebuckling. A part of them wishes they could do that, and another part turns that into, \"they shouldn't be allowed to do that.\" It's a fairly human response, but it's also an assholish one.\n\nNTA", "NTA - You're a man using the men's restroom. And as a woman, I have no fucking idea why women take so god damn long in the restroom that they need to overtake the men's one too", "Me too, started doing it high school on choir bus trips, when we would stop at a fast food restaurant. I\u2019m the only girl in a family of boys. No big deal. Basically you see one penis peeing you\u2019ve seen them all.", "Totally did it at busy tourist destination that has small single room bathrooms. No line for mens & huge line for the womens. Came out to the huge line of women just glaring & upset that I \u201cskipped\u201d the line.", "Because they're selfish and immature.", "I have no idea what she\u2019s thinking.  I wouldn\u2019t use the men\u2019s room but I don\u2019t see the problem with everyone using their own stalls for privacy.\n\nBut to think that a man is somehow wrong for using the men\u2019s room is pretty bonkers.", "I was about to say this is a repost. I read yours a few weeks ago", "Any woman who isn't against being a bit of an exhibitionist can use a urinal. There's no way to make it classy, though.", "Right?   Who gawks at the urinals and then pearl clutches when there\u2019s a man at them?", "Guess they just wanted you to \"suffer\" along with the rest of them.", "I was at a large 4th of July event years ago. The line to the second floor ladies' room was forever long, so they let women use the men's room, which had no line.\n\nI had to admire the absolute lack of fucks this one woman had to give. She walked in, saw the stalls all occupied, and decided fuck it, urinal it is. She hiked up her dress, dropped her panties, leaned forward while backing up to the urinal, and just powerblasted it with piss. It definitely wasn't classy, but it was impressive.", "I have so many questions. Have you done this? Do you face out or in? Is it like a straddling the urinal situation?", "There are things like the \"Urinella\" that helps women to piss while standing. But I suggest to try it at home first. But if you get the hang of it, it works like a charm. Helped me a lot on festivals or on road trips with filthy restrooms.", "I mean hell, sure, but why was there a free one available for him to use then?", "I figured but since I was about 2 seconds away from peeing my pants, I was not waiting. If the men\u2019s would have been occupied, I\u2019d have been outside peeing in some bushes.", "Not much privacy when you\u2019re shoulder to shoulder with a dude taking a piss", "\ud83d\ude02 I did it once at school because I walked into the boys room by accident and just went with it.\nI faced out, but practically had the straddle the damn thing. Almost like a regular toilet\u2026. Minus the tissue. So I had to run into the stall before I got caught.", "I'm a guy, but I've run with a rather... interesting group of friends. What seemed to work best was leaning back and using your hand to sort of raise the angle of the urethra. I'm positive you could find historical data out on the internet somewhere, as long as nobody ever looks at your search history.", "\"Can\" and \"will\" are two entirely different things. I CAN eat a pizza with pineapple on it, but it's not something I WILL eat.", "Am a woman.  What I find easiest is grabbing the front of the labia majora and lifting up.  That way the urethra lifts too.  Then with a careful amount of pressure, no dribble on your shoes!", "Oh I know, just pointing out that he still didn\u2019t affect the line on any way cuz none of these particular women were down w the public squat", "Thank you for a better technical explanation. I've only been near the process, not actually involved."]}
