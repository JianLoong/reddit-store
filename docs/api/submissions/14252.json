If the urinal is unoccupied it's fair game. For all genders.", "NTA...at all.

This is a double standard that has been going on for years and it needs to stop.

It's not your fault she was using the wrong bathroom.", "NTA.\n\nI'm assuming this was a single stall deal if there was a line out the Woman's bathroom. Why didn't the lady lock the door when she went in if she didn't want company. If it wasn't a single stall then she was the one taking a chance by going into the Men's room.

Understandable why, and not going to judge her for it, but she had no right to get huffy because you were using part of the facilities her, and the others in line, couldn't use in the room you were supposed to use. Not to mention the double standard of what would have happened if the opposite, a man in the woman's room, had occurred.", "NTA. As someone who is trans and actually uses the women\u2019s bathroom, I know the feeling all too well about people calling you a creep and cracking the shits at you for just using the bathroom. \ud83d\ude2d\n\nAnd it makes even less sense in your case since you didn\u2019t even go in there. I mean you identify as male, right? And there was no line to the men\u2019s toilet? Go right on in. Seems more like those women were jealous in all honesty. Maybe I\u2019d be annoyed if you could go in like that while I still had to wait but that is in no way your fault.", "NTA maybe in the future we'll have unisex toilets everywhere but until then women have no right using the men's because theirs is busy\n\nThe other way round they would likely have pressed charges if a man was caught using the ladies toilet", "INFO - was it just a normal, communal bathroom with some stalls and some urinals?
