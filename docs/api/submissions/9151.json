Even if her mental capacity was that of a toddler, she should be able to learn, that hitting others and throwing things is not okay. A young child would do this anyways when mad, but I'd always expect an adult to step in. \nAggressive behavior with the strength of an 8 yo is even more dangerous than in a toddler. Your cousin needs to step in.

Then he threatened that she would get spanked, but by pushing that off on someone else as well and not actually parent her (hitting isn't going to solve that issue).  He's refusing to parent. He's going to lose his job because he refuses to work with his child on learning acceptable behavior. Yes, it is exponentially harder with a special needs child, but it is his responsibility to teach her. You are not an ahole at all.", "My post was getting long and I left out a few important bits I suppose \n\nI\u2019ve been taking care of her sense her mom left when she was 2. I\u2019ve never hit her, I normally talk things out with her and I think it really scared her when he told her I would. From what I\u2019ve heard from others they think I\u2019m TA because she feels safe with me and I made her leave instead of helping her like I normally would. Her dad travels for work a lot so she\u2019s with me and I have her very often when he\u2019s not traveling for work as well. I have her at least 2 weeks a month.", "NTA. He needs to learn how to be a decent parent instead of threatening his child with physical violence. If your kid is having a meltdown, you help them put of that situation, not make it worse ffs. He is a neglectful parent, it's entirely his fault if he loses his job because he decided burning bridges is a fun hobby.", "NTA, dude needs a parenting course and some financial assistance to support his daughter.", "NTA Lea has a disability and needs to be taught how to play with other children.\nI hope he does not hit her", "NTA and if he loses his job its because he's a crappy employee,, he just wants to blame someone else for his problems.

Just refuse to watch her.", "NTA.", "I initially didn\u2019t think I was but my family is pretty split on this one so I was starting to question myself.
