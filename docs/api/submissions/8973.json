It also left my sister with postpartum depression and sepsis which  She has been struggling to take care of her daughter with her husband being really busy with work. When her daughter was two months old, she called me and begged me to come over and take care of her daughter for a couple of hours as she just 'desperately' needed a break from her daughter. I (34f) can't stand children so I refused but I offered to have my housekeeper drop off some food . She got really angry at my refusal and started saying how family supports each other and that she was going through a gard time and I was being a horrible, selfish sister. To be fair, I got pretty angry too and said that I didn't choose to ruin my life with a baby and she should have figured it out before the baby came and made sure she had a support network. I then rescinded the offer of food as I was pretty angry at her entitlement. She was distraught at that and send me dozens of messages saying sorry and saying that she could really use the food as she has no energy to cook and her husband doesn't know how, I just texted her that her behaviour was very rude and that I wasn't oigated to help her in anyway. After a few months of radio silence, we reconnected at the behest of my mother. She recently called me  when I was on a holiday with my boyfriend, presumably to vent about her struggles as a new mother. After a few minutes of her ranting how her daughter doesn't sleep, is sick constantly, etc, I asked her politely to please talk about something else as she was really bumming me out. She got really angry at that and after calling me the worst sister, selfish bitch and a few choice remarks, she blocked me. She has been dragging me over social media, saying that I refuse to support family in times of need and even complained to my mother who thinks I should have been more supportive.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: I asked my housekeeper who agreed, and who would be appropriately compensated with overtime pay. If my housekeeper disagreed, I would have had my driver pick up some food and drop it at their house.\n\nMy sister and I have never had a close relationship. She dislikes my childfree status and takes every opportunity to insult my status as woman as she is unable to comprehend how some people just don't want kids. While, I dislike how she decided to be a STAHM and judges evey single woman who did not make the same choices as her. Her husband works long hours due to the expenses of the baby and my sister's extensive medical bills.", "created_utc": 1675373329, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10s1g3d/aita_for_not_helping_my_sister_with_her_baby/", "score": 1695, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Can't you just be kind?", "NTA for not looking after the baby - I wouldn\u2019t want someone looking after mine that doesn\u2019t want to be there.\n\nBUT\n\nYour sister is clearly struggling and you don\u2019t seem to care. It doesn\u2019t take much to let someone vent and just let them know you care about them. You\u2019ve said she had/has PPD, this is a very real and horrible experience, admittedly one you can\u2019t relate to, but you could except that someone else is going through a shitty time. Out of interest, if it was depression without being related to motherboard, would you still cut her off for \u2018bumming you out\u2019 or would you listen and give time to her? You could offer to just be on the phone or help her with household stuff. The whole \u2018it takes a village\u2019 is so true but that doesn\u2019t mean everyone needs to look after the baby, just do something. \n\nOr, as you seem to revert to money, throw money at the problem and pay someone else to care?\n\nFor this, YTA.", "YTA seriously you know your sister is struggling hard with post partum and you can't be bothered to go sit there with your niece for a little while?

If she was asking for help because she got into a car accident, for example, you wouldn\u2019t blame her for being sick because she chose to drive a car. She\u2019s sick now too, but in your view it\u2019s her \u201cfault\u201d because of a life choice she made that you don\u2019t want for yourself. \n\nYour sister wasn\u2019t asking for you to come be a babysitter to her kid while she jetted off somewhere for girls night; she was just looking for any help she could while she\u2019s struggling physically due to a medical condition. You don\u2019t have to be Supernanny to be able to just suck it up for a couple of hours for the sake of your sick sister and feed a baby a bottle or put them down for a nap. Even if you didn\u2019t take care of the kid, you could still go over just to see what you COULD do - help tidy up, bring over some food (which you also denied her after she BEGGED you, out of sheer pettiness), just let her vent, etc.\n\n>After a few minutes of her ranting how her daughter doesn't sleep, is sick constantly, etc, I asked her politely to please talk about something else as she was really bumming me out.\n\nDo you always let your friends only talk to you about approved topics that you find uplifting, or is this reserved just for your sister? It doesn\u2019t have to be a lifestyle you can relate to, but your sister is venting to you about the reality that is her life right now. If you were having struggles at work and tried talking to her about them, would you be okay with her shutting you down that way?\n\nThe issue here really seems to be your resentment of people who choose to have children. You\u2019ve lost any basic sense of humanity or compassion toward your sister because of your superiority complex about not being a kid-person.", ">When her daughter was two months old, she called me and begged me to come over and take care of her daughter for a couple of hours as she just 'desperately' needed a break from her daughter.

It also left my sister with postpartum depression and sepsis which  She has been struggling to take care of her daughter with her husband being really busy with work. When her daughter was two months old, she called me and begged me to come over and take care of her daughter for a couple of hours as she just 'desperately' needed a break from her daughter. I (34f) can't stand children so I refused but I offered to have my housekeeper drop off some food . She got really angry at my refusal and started saying how family supports each other and that she was going through a gard time and I was being a horrible, selfish sister. To be fair, I got pretty angry too and said that I didn't choose to ruin my life with a baby and she should have figured it out before the baby came and made sure she had a support network. I then rescinded the offer of food as I was pretty angry at her entitlement. She was distraught at that and send me dozens of messages saying sorry and saying that she could really use the food as she has no energy to cook and her husband doesn't know how, I just texted her that her behaviour was very rude and that I wasn't oigated to help her in anyway. After a few months of radio silence, we reconnected at the behest of my mother. She recently called me  when I was on a holiday with my boyfriend, presumably to vent about her struggles as a new mother. After a few minutes of her ranting how her daughter doesn't sleep, is sick constantly, etc, I asked her politely to please talk about something else as she was really bumming me out. She got really angry at that and after calling me the worst sister, selfish bitch and a few choice remarks, she blocked me. She has been dragging me over social media, saying that I refuse to support family in times of need and even complained to my mother who thinks I should have been more supportive.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

What is he supposed to do? Hopefully he\u2019s helping as much as he can when he\u2019s not at work, we really can\u2019t tell anything about that from this post, but she\u2019s still alone with the baby 8 hrs/day minimum and he can\u2019t just leave whenever he wants to help her out.\n\nNobody is entitled to help but OP also isn\u2019t entitled to people not thinking she\u2019s a bad person for acting like this.", "I honestly couldn\u2019t believe when I read he doesn\u2019t know how to cook. So she\u2019s going through all these health issues and he expects her to still cook for them?! He can at least buy prepackaged meals that come with all the ingredients and steps on how to cook them. Then make a freaking salad. They come prepackaged too. There dinner is served.", "I agree. Her husband needs to step up and help if she\u2019s struggling so bad. Or their mom can help.

However, the sister probably doesn\u2019t want a stranger in her house at a time when she was feeling super vulnerable and overwhelmed.", "Seriously, all these comments about sepsis have me counting my blessings. My husband had it last year. He had a tick bite that got a bit swollen and itchy. He went to work and in the space of 6 hours the swelling got to the point where he had a golf ball sized lump on his shoulder. He left work early for urgent care and they sent him to our local ER where they treated him for the sepsis. \n\nWe left for work at the same time. He showed me his shoulder and it looked irritated but nothing crazy. By the time I got out of work to see him in the ER (literally 8 hours later), he looked worse than I have ever seen him. They had him on an IV because he was running a super high fever and was wicked dehydrated. The doctors told me he was smart to get checked out so soon because this could have passed the point of no return very quickly.\n\nIt still gives me chills thinking about it. I could have so easily been a widow at 35. Thank you, antibiotics and modern medicine!", "I'm glad your Dad is healing. I hope he makes a full and quick recovery. \n\nSadly I lost my Dad to sepsis. He had a stomach blockage that caused a hole in his intestines because the drs waited a week to do the surgery. Doctors missed the hole during surgery so the infection leaked out into the rest of his body and he turned sepsis. \n\nIt happened so quickly too. July will be 2 years since we lost him and I still can't get over how fast everything happened. We were literally taken by surprise.  He was awake and talking that morning. By 11am he was in a coma and we were told we should prepare ourselves. \n\nLearned that day that the covid policy limit of 1 visitor a day didn't apply if the patient is on their deathbed.

It says the husband has to work long hours to keep the bills paid, which is completely relatable.\n\nShe needs emotional support and help when he's off working. The same was true when my kids were born, I had to go right back to work to keep a paycheck coming in. My wife still needed help during the day, and luckily, she was able to rely on her parents, brother, SIL, and neighbors, while I was working.\n\nIt's not just about needing help with a baby. She's recovering from surgery and sepsis. She has postpartum depression, and she needs some more helping hands.", "Come on! You know that's not how it works on reddit!", "My sentiments exactly.  She seems to want her extended family to take up her hubby's slack.  The comment saying she needs food because hubby can't cook is crazy.

Im getting so sick of people being like \u201cwell, you technically have a legal right to say no, but its still shitty. I guess nta.\u201d\n\n NO! Theyre just an asshole! yeah they can legally do whatever they want but its still morally gross and selfish.", "OP doesn\u2019t owe her husband anything either, so probably not. Poor thing is just surrounded by entitled people who inexplicably want her in their lives. But she\u2019s working on that.", "It\u2019s disturbing.

Like am I the only one that\u2019s confused on y OP sister asked her? She got a husband and can ask her side of the family or the other side of the family.

A few minutes later when it was our turn and I was up at the counter he walked over put down a teddy bear for my daughter and a box of chocolate for me and told the girl to ring it up together and he covered the co-pays (like $30). I tried to protest and offered to pay, but he said he's old and they don't have kids so they try to help out anyone's kids they can. That random stranger did more for me than OP did for her sister.

Like sister apologized, if OP had an ounce of empathy she would still send in food.", "Mine did too, that part in particular made me so sad for the sister. To send a dozen messages begging to not rescind the offer of food, in my opinion, means she was pretty desperate at that point for help in simply feeding herself.

I called my doctor and his receptionist put me on hold, came back and asked if I could come in, as they had samples of that medication they could give me while they argued with my insurance company. When I picked up the bag I just grabbed it and left. When I got home there was not only the meds, but $200 and a note to fill the original prescription. I called back saying I couldn\u2019t take that. His response was \u201cI\u2019m single with no kids.

That bar is so low, Satan would trip over it in his wine cellar. I gathered that OP is a CAREER DRIVEN WOMAN who is independent and doesn't want kids.

No, but we have mutual friends and so we will run across each other. Will I go out of my way to greet her when I run into her? No. But if she had a serious life event, I wouldn't be the faux nice by sending a housekeeper to send over food and renege on it and trivialize her pain.

You chose this.\" I wouldn't and she wouldn't either.", "We are very different people at the end of the day and just don't get along.
