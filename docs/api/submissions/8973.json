It also left my sister with postpartum depression and sepsis which  She has been struggling to take care of her daughter with her husband being really busy with work. When her daughter was two months old, she called me and begged me to come over and take care of her daughter for a couple of hours as she just 'desperately' needed a break from her daughter. I (34f) can't stand children so I refused but I offered to have my housekeeper drop off some food . She got really angry at my refusal and started saying how family supports each other and that she was going through a gard time and I was being a horrible, selfish sister. To be fair, I got pretty angry too and said that I didn't choose to ruin my life with a baby and she should have figured it out before the baby came and made sure she had a support network. I then rescinded the offer of food as I was pretty angry at her entitlement. She was distraught at that and send me dozens of messages saying sorry and saying that she could really use the food as she has no energy to cook and her husband doesn't know how, I just texted her that her behaviour was very rude and that I wasn't oigated to help her in anyway. After a few months of radio silence, we reconnected at the behest of my mother. She recently called me  when I was on a holiday with my boyfriend, presumably to vent about her struggles as a new mother. After a few minutes of her ranting how her daughter doesn't sleep, is sick constantly, etc, I asked her politely to please talk about something else as she was really bumming me out. She got really angry at that and after calling me the worst sister, selfish bitch and a few choice remarks, she blocked me. She has been dragging me over social media, saying that I refuse to support family in times of need and even complained to my mother who thinks I should have been more supportive.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1675373329, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10s1g3d/aita_for_not_helping_my_sister_with_her_baby/", "score": 261, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Can't you just be kind?", "NTA for not looking after the baby - I wouldn\u2019t want someone looking after mine that doesn\u2019t want to be there.\n\nBUT\n\nYour sister is clearly struggling and you don\u2019t seem to care. It doesn\u2019t take much to let someone vent and just let them know you care about them. You\u2019ve said she had/has PPD, this is a very real and horrible experience, admittedly one you can\u2019t relate to, but you could except that someone else is going through a shitty time. Out of interest, if it was depression without being related to motherboard, would you still cut her off for \u2018bumming you out\u2019 or would you listen and give time to her? You could offer to just be on the phone or help her with household stuff. The whole \u2018it takes a village\u2019 is so true but that doesn\u2019t mean everyone needs to look after the baby, just do something. \n\nOr, as you seem to revert to money, throw money at the problem and pay someone else to care?\n\nFor this, YTA.", "YTA seriously you know your sister is struggling hard with post partum and you can't be bothered to go sit there with your niece for a little while? She sounds at her breaking point and you just don't care? You're incredibly selfish and yeah a pretty awful sister.

Like, yes, you\u2019re not obligated to help her out, but you\u2019re so mean and stuck up about  it that I can\u2019t say you\u2019re NTA. Your sister is going through a rough time and reached out for help and you can\u2019t help her even once.

If she was asking for help because she got into a car accident, for example, you wouldn\u2019t blame her for being sick because she chose to drive a car. She\u2019s sick now too, but in your view it\u2019s her \u201cfault\u201d because of a life choice she made that you don\u2019t want for yourself. \n\nYour sister wasn\u2019t asking for you to come be a babysitter to her kid while she jetted off somewhere for girls night; she was just looking for any help she could while she\u2019s struggling physically due to a medical condition. You don\u2019t have to be Supernanny to be able to just suck it up for a couple of hours for the sake of your sick sister and feed a baby a bottle or put them down for a nap. Even if you didn\u2019t take care of the kid, you could still go over just to see what you COULD do - help tidy up, bring over some food (which you also denied her after she BEGGED you, out of sheer pettiness), just let her vent, etc.\n\n>After a few minutes of her ranting how her daughter doesn't sleep, is sick constantly, etc, I asked her politely to please talk about something else as she was really bumming me out.\n\nDo you always let your friends only talk to you about approved topics that you find uplifting, or is this reserved just for your sister? It doesn\u2019t have to be a lifestyle you can relate to, but your sister is venting to you about the reality that is her life right now. If you were having struggles at work and tried talking to her about them, would you be okay with her shutting you down that way?\n\nThe issue here really seems to be your resentment of people who choose to have children. You\u2019ve lost any basic sense of humanity or compassion toward your sister because of your superiority complex about not being a kid-person.", ">When her daughter was two months old, she called me and begged me to come over and take care of her daughter for a couple of hours as she just 'desperately' needed a break from her daughter.

It also left my sister with postpartum depression and sepsis which  She has been struggling to take care of her daughter with her husband being really busy with work. When her daughter was two months old, she called me and begged me to come over and take care of her daughter for a couple of hours as she just 'desperately' needed a break from her daughter. I (34f) can't stand children so I refused but I offered to have my housekeeper drop off some food . She got really angry at my refusal and started saying how family supports each other and that she was going through a gard time and I was being a horrible, selfish sister. To be fair, I got pretty angry too and said that I didn't choose to ruin my life with a baby and she should have figured it out before the baby came and made sure she had a support network. I then rescinded the offer of food as I was pretty angry at her entitlement. She was distraught at that and send me dozens of messages saying sorry and saying that she could really use the food as she has no energy to cook and her husband doesn't know how, I just texted her that her behaviour was very rude and that I wasn't oigated to help her in anyway. After a few months of radio silence, we reconnected at the behest of my mother. She recently called me  when I was on a holiday with my boyfriend, presumably to vent about her struggles as a new mother. After a few minutes of her ranting how her daughter doesn't sleep, is sick constantly, etc, I asked her politely to please talk about something else as she was really bumming me out. She got really angry at that and after calling me the worst sister, selfish bitch and a few choice remarks, she blocked me. She has been dragging me over social media, saying that I refuse to support family in times of need and even complained to my mother who thinks I should have been more supportive.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Really hope you don't make a habit of threatening people with self-harm to get what you want.", "While it is true that postpartum is tough, no person is allowed to ask you to do something you're extremely uncomfortable with.  I'm not saying the OP is right for how she talked to her sister. I do, however, think she isn't wrong for setting a boundary and stating she wasn't comfortable crossing it. Not everyone has to like or want to be around kids. Why isn't the sister's husband or their mom or in-laws stepping in? Why is it the sole responsibility of an adult who doesn't like children to be accommodating?", "It doesn\u2019t seem like they have a good relationship at all. I don\u2019t think someone is entitled to help just because they\u2019re related. I would argue about biting the bullet and helping if they were close. This doesn\u2019t seem to be the case though.", "Nope. You don't own your siblings, you can't demand things of them.", "Sbe literally immediately offered to send someone with food after she said not to babysitting.", "No is a complete sentence. OP doesn't want to and that's her right.", "But I feel like the point of AITA is not whether someone is within their right, but more whether their choice morally makes them an AH.", "The best part is you're calling someone obtuse who was part of a friend network for someone that went through this exact scenario, but with twins. They took steps to make sure that they would have support if something went sideways. Then, when it did, there was a parade of people managing the house, making sure she bathed, watching the kids, helped the husband re-arrange furniture, etc.\n\nYou cannot plan for a car accident. You can have plan for shit going sideways when you have a child. They are totally different things.", "OP probably \u201ccan\u2019t stand\u201d sick people either so she\u2019d leave her husband all alone in the hospital.", "She may not have had a different helper.", "There's no guarantee your kids will hold your hand at your deathbed either. Just look at care homes full of seniors who were abandoned there by kids who ghost them.\n\nFamily isn't a guaranteed support network. I wish more people would figure that out.", "You\u2019ve said it all right there. Your mom helps your grandma without complaint. That means everything. It shows kindness, compassion, selflessness, love. Look, there are always going to be extreme circumstances. I haven\u2019t spoken to my sister for 12 years. If she rang me tomorrow and begged for help it would take a lot for me to agree. But I think I probably would, because I don\u2019t want to be the type of person who doesn\u2019t help someone who needs it regardless of our issues. \n\nYou and your family are dealing with your troubles brilliantly. I hope your dad continues to recover - it can be done, i\u2019m proof of that!", "They likely did think about it, but didn\u2019t plan for sepsis or PPD.", "You can\u2019t find and schedule a sitter with zero notice. It sounds like something of an emergency situation where the sister was having a breakdown. Which could be really unsafe for the baby. \n\nAlso, just the general logistics of finding sitters,  contacting them, meeting them, getting your space set up for a stranger to come care for your kid\u2026 can be A LOT for someone who is depressed and overwhelmed.", "So poor people shouldn't have kids?", "What a practical and usable solution! Oh wait, it was just an opportunity for you to be the AH.", "It's a baby. They cry and sleep. I always feel incredibly awkward around children, and I helped my sister with her children when she was going through a crisis. She was just grateful I was there and trying.", "Really? Everyone says \u201c you matter! Reach out to a loved one if you\u2019re in crisis.\u201d Suicide prevention tip number one.\n\nHer sister reached out in crisis, and she was rudely very rudely shut down completely and then what help that was offered was withdrawn.\n\nIt\u2019s not a threat or manipulation. This woman is dealing with very real medical struggles, life threatening complications, one top of depression and the pressures of new motherhood. Being hateful when someone we care about reaches out for help is a choice, even if we disagree with their situation and it\u2019s not our responsibility.", "It\u2019s not a manipulative threat, it\u2019s a reality check. Suicide is a leading cause of death postpartum, accounting for 20% of deaths in the first year after childbirth. Postpartum depression isn\u2019t a joke, it\u2019s not just being a little overwhelmed or kind of sad, and it\u2019s not the mother\u2019s fault.", "Yeah, she chose the baby- not the emergency c-section, the sepsis, and the ppd. If anything a SISTER should be there for support if not physically then emotionally if something this drastic happened to your sibling. I hate the \u201cit\u2019s not my fault your life is xyz\u201d statement when one of the possible- most simplest- solution is to be there while they vent. Op doesn\u2019t have an ounce of empathy in her soul, she literally brushed off all her sisters problems bc they \u201cbummed her out\u201d yeah, I bet they bum your sister out too OP, but it helps to vent and know that your struggles are heard.", "I\u2019m not threatening OP with anything. You wouldn\u2019t feel guilty if you refused to help a family member in crisis and they hurt themselves? I\u2019m glad OP doesn\u2019t have to deal with that because it would be horrible.", "this is why I prefer not to tell people that I'm child-free. I don't want to be lumped in with such unempathetic people who say things like 'no one is allowed to ask their siblings for help when theyre suffering serious issues'.", "No one is allowed to *ask* things now?  Why not?  OP obviously said no.  Her sister isn't the bad guy here.  She can ask whatever she wants.  She wasn't demanding.", "If you\u2019re only going to help people you\u2019re close with, I would seriously question your character", "Yeah, she's not obligated to help, but she's still an asshole if she doesn't.", "Fair enough, it\u2019s a fine line to cross. I\u2019ve honestly been flip flopping on my thoughts regarding this OP a bit since reading her comments, so \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "You can't really plan for sepsis and post partum...", "In all fairness, her husband should have known better than to ruin his life by getting sick. He should know better. OP the the most asshole person possible. Obviously YTA", "She has a husband. If he can\u2019t come home in case of an emergency he\u2019s probably a pretty shitty parent.", "Then she needs to be hospitalized and the father has to step up, or they need to get the child into daycare", "She has a husband. She also has a mom who seems to think the family should be stepping up.", "Thank you for your kind words.", "I grew up in a poor family and it was shit. So no they shouldn't, it's child abuse.", "No they shouldn\u2019t. Why bring children into that environment?", ">Yeah, she chose the baby- not the emergency c-section, the sepsis, and the ppd.\n\nDo people think that having a child doesn't come with risks? You can want a baby til the cows come home but you cannot ignore all of the very real risks that come along with it and be surprised pikachu when it's not all roses. \n\nMy husband and I bought a completely gutted house last year and we're doing the entire renovation ourselves while living in it, in our first year of marriage. I Everyone and everything I read told me it was going to be REALLY hard. Despite our meticulous planning.... It's SO MUCH HARDER than I thought. We showered outside with a hose for the first 5 months, haven't had a kitchen in 9 months, I'm trying to navigate WFH through the sound of jackhammering and other constant construction noises, we're always sick from the dust, and we're quickly running out of money. I am depressed and really fucking tired of it. But guess what? I'm an adult and I signed up for this knowing it was going to be hard as fuck. I don't complain to ANYONE about it but my husband... the only other willing participant. This was a choice that we made. \n\nFWIW, I love my sister ver much and I would not standby and watch her struggle without trying to help in any way I could. But to put \\*blame\\* on OP if something happened to her sister? No.", "I'm a parent and I have lots of great childfree people in my life and in my daughter's life. I value you guys because you have different perspectives and experiences to share.\n\n The *aggressively childfree* are just angry, selfish, maladjusted fringe people who have made it their entire personality to hate one of the most powerless and exploited groups on the planet.", "They actually said \"no one is obligated to help their sister in a way that makes them uncomfortable\", imo.", "You can ask for help but it's also okay for people to say no, even if you're family. I'm not sure why this is even considered unempathetic. I would personally help my sister if she was struggling and happily watch my niece and future nephew. That's because I love kids. I don't want my own but I'll help my friends and family where I can.  \n\nThat said, I also understand that's not the reality for everyone.  Some people just simply dislike kids and being around them.  It's a boundary for them that no one should force them to cross. I will reiterate that I don't agree with how OP treated her sister. She's TA for not offering support in other ways.  It doesn't take much to be on a phone call and just be kind. However, she's not wrong for saying she doesn't want to watch a kid that's not hers because frankly she just doesn't feel comfortable. I'm not sure why grown adults on here are berating her for setting a boundary and saying she should've sucked it up and helped. I don't think anyone would say that if it were a different boundary like say being forced to contribute financially towards caring for the child while mom got help. Both are requests from family, yet saying no to watching a baby would make you the devil even if you're not comfortable.", "I never said the sister was bad. I simply said that it's completely okay to state your boundary, say no and not be berated for it. Op said no. It was completely unnecessary for the sister to drag her for it. However, she wasn't in the best mindset so she can't be the AH. Neither is OP though for saying no after a clear boundary was set.", "Well, I\u2019m certainly not inviting every homeless person I see into my home. I would have a pretty full home otherwise. Do you?\n\nThere is helping someone in an emergency and doing someone a favour in a different way. This wasn\u2019t an emergency. And even if it was the sister has a husband available. She isn\u2019t the only caretaker of this child.", "Nah.", "Or they don't have so much money that he can afford to take time off work", "I also get the feeling that he\u2019s likely a shitty parent. That\u2019s *more* reason to be supportive of the sister, not less.", "Yes, because daycares are all so eager to take newborns.\n\nHaving a crisis in the first few weeks after a birth is completely normal. Newborns are really really hard. And this woman also almost died. Both parents are likely running on little sleep.\n\nHer husband is probably at work and if this is the US she doesn't even have proper maternity leave.", "Lol, ok", "All due respect- your \u201cloud noise\u201d didn\u2019t exactly almost kill you now did it? Yes people know *some* risks, but you have to admit not every woman knows *every single danger* on having a child. It\u2019s not spoken about a ton unless you *look for the info*, and on TOP of that many women don\u2019t realize they\u2019re pregnant until they\u2019re well into their pregnancy. \n\nJust because you say she \u201cknew the risks\u201d doesn\u2019t mean she shouldn\u2019t get support while actually going through it, bc it\u2019s \u201cbumming you out.\u201d That\u2019s called being an AH and a poor sister. \n\nAlso I never mentioned anything about blaming OP of anything were to happen to her sister.", "Jesus, thank you.\n\nI cannot deal with the aggressively childfree people on reddit. They're just awful.", "You literally said no one is allowed to ASK for help, so idk why you're pretending you didn't.", "That\u2019s maybe a terrible timing to have a child then. \n\nThey can\u2019t have 0 preparation and only one available parent and then expect everyone around them to drop their whole lives to jump to their rescue. They had 9 months to organise themselves a bit, trying to make support arrangements. But they didn\u2019t and then ask an estranged sister to help?\n\nMost people who are in need for a support network ask those people in advance if they can fall back on their support.", "Is reading comprehension a big problem for you? I haven't edited my comment. You can see that it clearly states no one is allowed to ask you to do something you're extremely uncomfortable with. Emphasis on things you're extremely uncomfortable with. And OP literally says they aren't comfortable. So when the sister asked she politely declined. And that's where I don't feel OP is wrong. Do I personally think she could be a better human? Yes! Do I think she could offer support in other ways? Also, yes! But no you really shouldn't ask people to do things they're not comfortable with.", "We don't know if the child was planned. Sometimes life will find a way.\n\nAlso it doesn't sound like the birth was typical and therefore the expenses surrounding it may also have been a typical depending on where they live. Things in general are also more expensive than anyone could have forseen over a year ago when the sister got pregnant. There is only so many unknowns you can prepare for.\n\nAnd 'drop their whole lives' is a bit of a dramatic, for a few hours of watching a child."]}
