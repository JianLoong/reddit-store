I work and husband is a stay at home dad. We have been outspending my salary each month, which was expected yr 1-2 but we haven\u2019t been able to get it under control. Our apartment has cost a lot more than expected but due to ongoing litigation between the association and a terrible neighbor we doubt anyone will buy it right now. Some other options are sell our boat, hubby gets a job, rent out the apartment, and rent something here that is much smaller, or move to an ultra conservative area near his family with lower cost of living where we could afford a house & the boat but get a lacking education and politics we don\u2019t agree with. I\u2019m also not confident how great I\u2019d be as a fully remote employee. He is anti moving somewhere without ocean access and I\u2019d like to stay near family.  Aita for wanting us to make drastic changes instead of moving? He believes he tried city life already and any further cuts are a death wish on his quality of life.\n\nEdited to add info: \n\nMoney - the biggest issue is we got screwed on our apartment. There were undisclosed assessments and building fees that we learned about two months after closing and under guidance couldn\u2019t do anything. In hindsight we should have sold then but I was 4 weeks postpartum & not thinking straight. Our neighbor has flooded our apartment, didn\u2019t pay his piece, and stopped paying all building fees as retaliation for the association deciding he owed any money. It\u2019s a small building so all other units are responsible for covering this owner and a lawyer while the association fights him. We thought this would be resolved by now, but it\u2019s not. Otherwise it surprises like appliances breaking/utilities increasing/dog getting cancer (he\u2019s good now!). \n\nwe both used to work 60+ hours a week and decided that if we wanted a family we wanted  a better balance. We moved to this new job where I\u2019ve got a great boss and family near by. A stay at home parent was a goal for me but is not required. Hubby would prefer to play/teach kiddo & clean house than work. I have a niche job I love. So it seemed like a good match initially. \n\nWe got a really good deal on the boat, so it\u2019s 100-200 a month (dockage is already paid) & selling would get us a short term bump but not long term. I can check the paperwork but I think we\u2019re both on the title / I can\u2019t sell it without his signature. \n\nWe\u2019re 4 months into this conversation. I have gone through all other bills/groceries/sold the car/talked to financial advisor and cry yelled \u201cfucking please just get a job\u201d \ud83e\udee3 \n\nWe used to live in the now ultra conservative town and still have friends/family there so the changes aren\u2019t all assumed.", "created_utc": 1682701786, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1322o0r/aita_for_wanting_my_spouse_to_make_drastic/", "score": 50, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Boats are NOTORIOUS money pits and not worth it for most people.  Also, there are a lot more options for renting boats nowadays for days/weekends, so if you sell the boat you could get out of marina and maintenance fees, and then you could look into renting a boat a couple times a year to have fun.  \n\n> hubby gets a job\n\nAlso a great option, but as someone in a very HCOL city myself, I would look into daycare costs before pulling this trigger.  I know so many people who don't work simply because their daycare costs would eat their entire paycheck.  And these are skilled workers as well!  So you should definitely do the math on this one, especially with an infant on the way, to make sure that this wouldn't put you out of the frying pan and into the fire.  \n\n>rent out the apartment, and rent something here that is much smaller\n\nAlso great options, especially while the kiddos are very small.  You could get away with a very small 2-bd for a couple more years, and this might put you back on track.  \n\n>move to an ultra conservative area near his family with lower cost of living where we could afford a house & the boat but get a lacking education and politics we don\u2019t agree with\n\nAn option, but as a woman of childbearing age myself, this would *terrify* me in terms of access to certain kinds of medical care, especially in the case of an emergency.  \n\nNTA.  I don't think the changes you've proposed are \"drastic\" at all.  I think they are incredibly reasonable and make a lot of sense.  But you could consider moving somewhat out of the city.  My fiance and I live about 26 miles outside the city.  It's close enough to commute in (though the commute can be murder), especially since neither of us are in the office 5 days a week.  But it's far enough out that that housing costs are half of what they would be in the big city (could be less, tbh, but we've chosen to live in a cute historic downtown of a smaller city where we can walk to the waterfront).
