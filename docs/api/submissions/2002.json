He has a child with a college fling, child is 5 years old. \n\nHe has lived with his parents since child was 1yo and his parents are basically free childcare for him. We get his child every other weekend. While we have her, he often runs errands or goes to the gym and his mom will offer to watch child. \n\nSo this weekend his parents are out of town. I am meeting bio mom at my work tomorrow to pick child up because it\u2019s closer for both her and my boyfriend. I don\u2019t mind this at all and would love to help. \n\nWell tonight boyfriend got home from the gym and we sat down for dinner and conversation started. He mentions that he wants to go to the gym after work tomorrow. \n\nMe: okay but I\u2019d like for you to be home when me and your child get home. \n\nHim: okay but I\u2019d like to go to the gym this weekend \n\nMe: well you\u2019ll have to do that after you drop child off on Sunday \n\nHim: well I thought you could watch child for me while I go \n\nI basically told him no. I\u2019m not his babysitter or free childcare. I\u2019d be happy to watch child if he has an obligation but it\u2019s not fair for him to expect me to watch her so he can go do something fun.

Exactly?\n5. NTA but you will be if you stay with this person.", "NTA. He only gets kiddo a few days per month...why does he fill those days with other shit? \nAt the end of the day, you're never required or obligated to babysit, and don't need any reason. No is a full sentence. But I'm not sure if this relationship is ultimately compatible", "NTA. From a you perspective: Firstly, massive ask of you. Secondly, why hasn't he made child care arrangements if he needs to go to the gym. Thirdly: Why is he spending time at gym over his child.????\n\nMassive marinara on this one.", "NTA. He has her every other other weekend and realizes on someone\u2019s else to watch her constantly? That\u2019s a huge red flag.

Take over some task you are supposed to do when you can't or don't want to do it?\n\nNTA:  He only has her every other weekend.  I agree with you that he should prioritize his time with her.", "NTA. Why the hell is he doing things like that instead of spending time with his child? If he has errands like shopping, he could always take the child with him to spend more quality time. The gym can wait a couple of days. You are also not obligated to take care of his child, who he barely ever sees, while he does unimportant things.", "[deleted]", "NTA\n\nAs a parent myself I want go tell you that you did nothing wrong.\nHe is the father.

Irresponsible fathers generally don't make good partners.", "NTA, but why are you with someone who has proven they are essentially a deadbeat dad? When does he ever spend quality time with his child?", "NTA- he should prioritize spending time with his kid. Not fair to you or the kid. If thats how he is while he has his child, then maybe he shouldn\u2019t have any custody. He can wait to go to the gym and spend time with his daughter.", "What is attractive about someone who ditches their kid with grandma on the only days he has her?", "NTA. If I'm reading your correctly, he only gets to see his 5-year-old daughter *every other weekend*. He needs to clear his schedule on those weekends and devote his time to his child.\n\nI know it's clich\u00e9, but it's true -- when his daughter is grown and off on her own adventures, he won't be wishing he'd spent more time at the gym and doing errands.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

And  you are correct, you are not a babysitter nor the childs new step mother.\n\nNTA", "NTA. His fling, his child, his responsibility. Help where you deem fitting, not just where he desires.

As you said, he can hit the gym after the drop off, and the other 26-27 days of the month that he\u2019s not with that poor child. I don\u2019t understand why he needs all this daycare help for weekends. I assume he\u2019s working during those days and still doesn\u2019t want to watch his kid. \nHonestly the more I think about it the more I realize how much better you could do for yourself. The hills are that-a-way.", "So he only gets to see his child every other weekend and he\u2019s already planning on other people caring for the child?

Also he isn't spending time with his child when he does that. Op, do you want kids with this dude?", "So...he doesn't enjoy spending time with his daughter? NTA. He has her for 2 days he can take off from the gym for those two days and spend them with her. He has 5 other days he can go to the gym and do something he enjoys.", "Why are you spending years dating someone with a child if you do not want a relationship with a child? That decision doesn't make you TA, but a serious relationship with a parent when you don't want to be a parent? YTA This isn't about this weekend and a trip to the gym. You need to figure out your position on this and commit. \n\nIf you have no intention of taking care of his daughter,  whom you have apparently known since she was 2 years old, do everyone a favor and break up with him.", "I\u2019m gonna take a risk by commenting my opinion before I\u2019ve read any other judgements, but I\u2019m going with NTA. \n\nYour boyfriend is shirking his responsibility as a parent. He only gets his kid every other weekend? That\u2019s what, 4 days a month plus change? And he just can\u2019t be bothered to be there for his kid. Making other people do all the work for him. \n\nFor him, looking after his kid is his responsibility. For you to look after his kid is a favor. You are not obligated to babysit for free. \n\nIf he had a pressing matter to attend to, it would be a little contentious for you to refuse to help with his kid. But it\u2019s not. He just wants to go to the gym. That\u2019s a hobby. \n\nIf I were you, I would take this conflict as a crucial moment in your relationship. If you want to stay with this guy, you\u2019ll probably have to deal with this behavior every other weekend. If you have kids together, it sounds like he might be the type of guy who would expect you to bear the brunt of childcare. \n\nThis whole thing is a big red flag.", "NTA.  Don't marry this man.  Don't marry this man.  Don't have children with this man.  You have been warned.", "NTA he gets his child like what 6 days a month and he expects you to watch his kid in the little time that he has her? Why is he even pretending to be a parent? Do not consider having a kid with him, I guarantee you will do one hundred percent of the child care.", "NTA. Run, before you find yourself always at home watching the kids while he goes out partying.", "Because she also gets to mooch off his parents and doesn't care that he's a deadbeat dad unless it impacts her.", "Uhh I mean I guess little things?

Dude doesn\u2019t watch his own kid.", "Lol damn. I have watched his child multiple times while he has obligations, I feed her, bathe her, do her laundry. I am picking her up tomorrow. I love his child and want her in my life. I DO NOT want him to prioritize doing hobbies over spending time with his child.

I think she actually is an Ah but the question specifically was about if she was for refusing childcare, so I had to say no.", "Info: do you eventually want kids?\n\nIf so why would you be with someone who can't care for a child 4 days a  month?\n\nESH cause you give him a pass to be checked out as a parent by staying with him", "If he is asking you to babysit and do things for you, you need to get used to asking him to do things for you.  Otherwise the relationship gets too lopsided and resentment builds.", "Yeah he\u2019s unlikely to suddenly become a hands on dad if you have kids, so I\u2019d keep that in mind. He can get exercise playing with his kid. They love to run around like crazy. NTA", "So why are you with him? When his mom is watching her, he\u2019s still prioritizing his hobbies over his daughter?\n\nYou\u2019re NTA for your question, but I don\u2019t understand why you think he\u2019s a good partner. Even if I didn\u2019t want kids of my own, I wouldn\u2019t want to be with someone who treated their child like this."]}
