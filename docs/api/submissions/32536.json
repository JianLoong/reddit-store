Apparently \"My parent invited themselves, you are very accommodating feel no obligation to be that way in this case\" did not translate via text.", "Dude, just say no.  You don\u2019t need a third party to say no for you, you just need to find your spine.", "Tell the landlord that the parent's dog is destructive and they would be problematic.", "NTA\n\nCancer is awful, but it does not excuse bad behavior.  I am so sorry your parents are like this; you do still get to decide who stays in your home.  Good luck OP.", "I think what you need to say to the landlord is \"my parents are inviting themselves and not listening to me say no. Their pet would absolutely not be one you want in your rental but they won't agree. Will you send me a clear statement that you forbid them from bringing their dog or staying in my place while I'm gone to help me protect your property?\"\n\nYou're NTA at all", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s your landlords responsibility to manage your parents. You\u2019re trying to get someone else to do your dirty work so you don\u2019t have to say  the word \u201cno.\u201d But dragging him/her into the middle of this conflict isn\u2019t right.", "Why not just tell him: I don\u2019t feel comfortable allowing them to stay. Their dog has been destructive in the post and I don\u2019t trust it. Them staying makes me uncomfortable but they aren\u2019t listening to me and will come even though I\u2019ve said no. Having you say no is my last resort. \n\nJust tell him the truth.", "Warn the landlord that this is a dog that shits in the house. He'll give you a letter saying no.", "Are your  parents gonna call him up and grill him? Just tell him about their bad dog.", "Just tell him your parents are crazy and won\u2019t accept you telling them no, so you need someone in a position of authority to say no. Tell him also how the dog shits inside and destroys stuff.", "I agree. It is an easy out, but just kicks the can down the road to the next manipulation.", "Or, tell the parents, \u201cno, your dog shits in the house\u201d"]}
