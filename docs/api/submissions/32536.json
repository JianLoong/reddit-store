Going a little longer than they would like between contact. Going as long as you can, living your life with your bf, without thinking about them. \n\nYou\u2019ve managed to create physical distance and I\u2019m sure that has helped your mental health immensely, even if they hate it. \n\nEven folks that call their parents every day spend time not thinking about or catering to their parents. \n\nI know you love them, you\u2019d have to in order to not go crazy with what all they ask of you. \n\nConsider this though: did either set of grandparents treat your parents the way they treat you? If they did, how did your parents react?  If they didn\u2019t, why is it ok for your parents to do this to you?\n\nThen, would you ever do this to your child?
