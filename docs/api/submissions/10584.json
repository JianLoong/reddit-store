Meaning it's not just your money but it's \"our money\".

I don't think more needs to be said as to why she quit. It all points to her being lazy, definitely not caring about the marriage, and just wanting everything handed to her as if she's a queen (his explanation of her reaction indicates that). A queen is respected because of what she does. A wife that stays at home, provides comfort to her husband, makes him feel safe, welcome, gives him joy when he returns after an arduous day of monetarily providing for his wife/family, would yes, most definitely deserve her subscriptions (although, 15?! Really? Seems like a bit much but if he has that kinda money, sure lol). But this woman doesn't even clean, he has to pay for maid in order for his home to be kept in check. This woman is a freeloader, not only that, her entitlement is out of this world.

Why on earth should he have to explain anything further than what he did? His edit looks to have more than enough information. Who the hell buys 15 different subscriptions on a STOLEN credit card?? How can you possibly try to spin that as even remotely okay? She made herself dependant on him; AGAINST HIS WISHES!!!! My god that's some insane entitlement; to think you can just quit your job, do nothing to provide for your husband/household, and to just expect the man you married to be fine with your lazy ass stuffing your face with junk, and watching reality TV every damn day?! Honestly, how can you even attempt to spin her as the victim in this situation? I understand there are multiple sides to a story, but I know men who have been tricked into situations like this one, and it's just abhorrent. Luckily, they're from countries where divorce wouldn't turn out how it potentially could for OP. It just seems like she's a gold digger like someone said below. If the roles were reversed, and he did this to her, this comment section would be a full of hate towards him. He would be called a \"slob, entitled, trash, lazy, not a proper man\".

Get that bag sis!\" (Even though it's HIS \"bag\" she's STEALING)\n\nI feel bad for this man, I hope all goes well for him, I hope his entitled wife starts treating him better, and with respect. I hope she learns that the behaviour she is displaying is not okay, and I hope she does her best to be a better person. Going behind his back, stealing his money, and acting as though he has to provide for her when she gives nothing in return, is appalling.

All the examples you gave were a \u201cbreak\u201d from your reality, knowing that it would end. \n\nI don\u2019t want to work, but I certainly don\u2019t want to just watch TV all the time. If I had to choose one or the other for the rest of my life, sadly, I\u2019d choose work, because at least then you can get out of the house, see work friends, be social, have schedule, shower regularly/feel good about yourself , etc.", "and its clearly NOT funny.", "Not really... based on the information he originally provided, he sounded like an asshole. If a woman posted the same thing without context, people would also say she was an asshole.", "You seem to give her a lot of benefit of the doubt while viewing what OP says as suspicious.", "Personally indian and my mom, her mom AND her mom all worked just fine. A large part of the workforce is women.", "15 TV subscriptions this woman is ridiculous! If she wants that much options she should go back to work and psy for it herself!", "Muslim. Dowry is a hindu concept and they were married in kuwait.", "ah this is a great question", "Marriage doesn't really work the same in all cultures/countries", "NTA. Based on the later edits you posted you shouldn't be cancelling her subscriptions, you should be throwing the lazy cow out of your house", "If your wife doesn't contribute to monthly expenses at all by working or contributing to household tasks then you are NTA.", "After your edits, NTA....She needs to get off her ass and get a job.", "Why can't she pay her own bills?", "NTA. You need to cut all access she has to your money. She needs to get a job.", "NTA. Lock your credit down. And try to get to the bottom of why she quit working thereby losing her income. The income that allows her to buy things she wants.", "lol not saying i believe this narrative. just re-stating what other ppl in this thread are saying. i dont agree at all with the assumption", "> If this was about a deadbeat guy, 0 people would even attempt to do so.\n\nSo strange, yesterday there was a post about a guy who said he wanted to quit work and focus on his art - so would his wife be fine telling him she would respect him less. Lots and lots of comments at the top immediately jumping to him being a piece of shit. \n\nOh but in this case: \"I'm sure there's a good reason for it\".", "OP himself confirm that it was India.", "Definitely NTA, sounds like a phenomenally toxic country/culture.", "YTA for saying \u201cmy money.\u201d You\u2019re married- it\u2019s both of yours\u2019 money. \n\nHow do the finances normally work in your relationship? Does she have to ask your permission for every penny she spends? Do you ask hers?", "NTA, I feel for your wife though. \n\n- you both need to agree on when money is spent and on what. She should be able to spend a few dollars here and there without having to get your approval. \n\n- I have no idea where you live, but it sounds like you could be in a place that is repressive towards women. If this is the case, lead with love and understanding, she hasn\u2019t had much - if any - control in her life and she\u2019s searching for it where she can find it. \n\n- she\u2019s bored, encourage her to find hobbies and do things she enjoys that aren\u2019t related to watching TV. Sometimes starting a hobby can cost money, so you should have a budget for that - who knows, maybe she assumes you won\u2019t spend money on a hobby that she cares for so she is stuck watching TV. \n\nOverall, you can work this out - but, it\u2019s not about the TV subscriptions, so don\u2019t approach it as if it is.", "Seems like you're focusing on the wrong problem in your AITA question.", "NTA anyway that you can get her to divorce you make it her life so uncomfortable that she tries to leave", "YTA in this situation. It *also* sounds like your marriage is a mess.", "NTA and a red flag. If shes putting herself in such a submissive position, place her there and leave her there. She'll realize soon enough.", "Nta.\n15 subscriptions? Oh hell no. \nMost things I watch are on 3-4 services. YouTube included. \nLike bro?? You don't need that many subscriptions. Smh.", "NTA\n\ncancel the maid too", "In most religious communities the power is usually geared toward the patriarchy."]}
