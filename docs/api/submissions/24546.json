I instantly fell for him when he pulled up in his truck and couldn\u2019t keep my eyes off of him for the rest of the day as he gave orders to his men. When we started dating, he was vague about his job and I just chalked it up to him being insecure about me having a better career. I didn\u2019t care about our income imbalance. When we got serious, we talked about our future plans and that was when he told me the full extent of his little construction company. I was shocked that his construction earnings is as much as my dad\u2019s surgeon salary. Gradually he took me around to the handful of construction lots and shopping centers he owns. His rental income combined with his construction earnings is double that of my dad\u2019s. He said that few people know about his finances and he expects me to keep what I know to myself.\n\nMy parents disapproved of him since the 1st time I brought him home. My dad coined the term \u201ctool boy\u201d and the rest of my family joined in whenever they talk behind my fianc\u00e9\u2019s back. They don\u2019t call him that to his face but instead make snide remarks. Once my mom said during dinner that they\u2019re thinking about hiring someone to mow their lawn then turned to my fianc\u00e9 and asked him what he charges. I always try to defend him and it\u2019s a constant battle. It\u2019s gotten worse since we\u2019re planning our wedding and the other day my nerves just broke. Yesterday parents were trying to get me into getting a prenuptial then my dad said, \u201cyou have to protect your assets just in case tool boy decides to go slumming.\u201d\n\nI lost it and yelled at my parents. During our shouting, I blurted out his earnings and that he makes more than both of them combined then I stormed out. I told my fianc\u00e9 what happened but instead of supporting me, he got mad that I told his parents that. I argued that I was defending him then we got into an argument.\n\nMy parents and family are mad at me for keeping secrets. My fianc\u00e9 is mad at me for not keeping secrets. I\u2019m stuck in the middle and don\u2019t know what to do.", "created_utc": 1691935075, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15pzlkm/aita_for_telling_my_family_how_much_my_fianc\u00e9/", "score": 294, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'd suggest to apologize to your fiance profusely, explain the entire context and situation, and ask if there is a way to make it up to him. Also, tell him you are going to work on ways and failsafes to never be in a position to blurt out confidential information again, and invite him to help you out with this. You will be husband and wife, and mistakes (even serious ones) will be made. This is your trial run to see if you can work together to rise above it, and improve on both the personal level and the joint one. Also, I'd consider just revoking your family's invitations to the wedding if they don't apologize to your husband for the attitude, to his face and behind his back. You don't need these toxic people in your life. They have already poisoned it before it's even begun.", "YTA kind of, but you come by it honestly because your parents are major dicks. Not sure how a marriage could work out with them calling the potential father of your children names and saying he\u2019s going to run off.", "YTA. To be clear, you are not TA for embarrassing your family by proving that they\u2019re snobs (they are), but you are TA for sharing information that your fianc\u00e9 *expressly asked you to keep private.*\n\nYour excuse is that you were defending him and so he shouldn\u2019t be mad, but you didn\u2019t tell your family about his finances for *his* benefit, you did it because *you* were frustrated with the snide comments and it made *your* life easier and meant *you* didn\u2019t have to deal with it anymore. \n\nThere are some things that are yours to to tell, and some things that aren\u2019t.  You shared private information about someone else, information that you had been asked to keep to yourself, for your benefit. That makes you TA, and you owe your fianc\u00e9 an apology and some damage control with your family.", "Im going to say ISH, weddings are stressful, and it sounds like you\u2019re under a massive amount of stress from your family. Technically YTA, but, I don\u2019t think you should be treated harshly for breaking under that stress. However your fianc\u00e9 needs to loosen up a little, it\u2019s not something to get that mad about.\n\n  Im curious, has your fianc\u00e9 explained why he keeps it quiet? I personally don\u2019t do business with or allow many of my family members to know my finances. Most are good people. But others will beg or borrow(steal) money, or create\nNightmare drama.", "YTA. He gave one clear instruction... Do not tell other people his income.\n\nYou had a tanty and threw it in your parents' faces, instead of just telling them that they need to stfu or not come to your wedding.\n\nI hope he makes you sign a prenup if you haven't broken his trust too much for him to marry you.", "I think NTA , sometimes you blurt things out in the heat of the moment especially when you are defending someone you care about. Your parents are definitely being AH\u2019s though", "NTA, your fianc\u00e9e seems a bit strange for never clearing this up, but would your family believe him if he did? - Seems unlikely.\n\nYour parents are TA here. You are in the middle of the argument.\n\nI would have gotten the prenup to shut your family up, if you hubby agrees, after all it would protect you both financially - your husband to be would benefit more than you because he makes more than you.", "YTA, yeah. This is private information, he asked you to keep secret, and you blurted it out cos you lost your temper. I can understand being frustrated with your parents. However you fucked with your relationship with your partner. Which matters more here.\n\nYou didn\u2019t have to share the earning, you could be vague and coy. You could have done a number of things. But your personal obsession with numbers and measuring people by their financial income - obviously inherited from your parents and with little work done on yourself to fix - meant it sounds like you revealed specifics too.\n\nYou\u2019re not stuck in the middle. You fucked up. You have private and confidential info and there were other ways to put it off. Getting angry is normal. Shouting out the exact amount your partner earns because you and your family have an elitist idea of what gives value, is not normal. \n\nGood luck.", "YTA\n\nHe asked you not to talk about it to anyone, but stroking your hurt ego was more important than his comfort and trust. Honestly, do you think he can trust you with opening up to you, knowing that you\u2019ll tell anyone his secrets in order to make yourself look good and worthy to live up to your family\u2019s ridiculous superiority complex? Do you realize that to him, he just realized that you care more about money and status and not really about him?", "Sorry to tell you this but you are the ass, you fianc\u00e9 asked you to keep this to yourself and you failed simply because you need your families approval. If he is that successful, he smart enough to read people and their behaviors, he already knows how your family feels and doesn\u2019t allow that to bother him.

Your family are snobby assholes. Your fianc\u00e9 is an asshole for making you keep a secret that really doesn\u2019t need to be that secretive from his soon to be in-laws. Most in-laws want to be sure you\u2019ll be able to take care of their daughter. He can but doesn\u2019t want them to know? That\u2019s dumb. I can see keeping finances a secret from the rest of the world, and he doesn\u2019t even have to go as far as opening the books and proving it, just tell them to \u201crelax in the knowledge that I make well into six figures\u201d. \n\nTelling your soon to be wife to keep secrets from her family isn\u2019t cool. It\u2019s not like a life-altering secret.", "You're a bit of an asshole for breaking your fiance's trust. Your parents and family are giant assholes. But I don't get why your fiance is so secretive about his finances given that he's marrying into the family. Is he running something illegal?", "NTA - idk why your fianc\u00e9e is being super weird about this and your parents are an ah generally as humans.", "Yta", "Well, your family sure sucks. I'm sorry.", "Soft YTA for sharing your fiance's secret. \n\nI assume that by now you have seen how he lives and know that what he says is true? There is very good money in construction (for the owner) so there is certainly no reason why it could not true.\n\nIf your fiance is a good man and has nothing to hide, he will forgive you if you are truly apologetic. Now that you are talking marriage, your parents should know that he makes a respectable income and does not need to mow lawns to pick up extra income. \n\nIf your fiance cannot forgive you, he is a hothead that you wouldn't want to be married to anyway, or he is not telling you the truth about his income and assets. \n\nPlease let us know how it works out and if you are forgiven.", "YTA: He asked you not to share that info.

It\u2019s perfectly possible to defend your choice of mate without divulging that piece of information. If my family ever disrespected someone I cared about like that, they\u2019d be picking their jaws up off the floor. Which is probably why they don\u2019t.", "NTA but your fiance is due an apology, he didn't want his business out there. But I understand why you did it in the heat of the moment. Also your family is full of assholes omg, I'm glad you turned out normal because wtf.", "YTA, and sadly you can't put this toothpaste back in the tube. \n\nI don't think you should be feeling caught in the middle; you don't owe this type of information to your parents. The person you should concentrate on making amends to is your fianc\u00e9.", "YTA. Your fianc\u00e9 set a clear and reasonable boundary and you violated it because you're still trying to get your parents' approval. Why are you allowing them to make snide comments to your fianc\u00e9 in the first place? Like you, I come from a very educated and professional family and my parents look down on my SO because he's not university educated. I made it very clear to them that he was off limits and I don't bring him into contact with them. I have also severely restricted my contact with my parents for the same reason. You need to stand up for your fianc\u00e9 or he will get fed up and leave", "YTA. It wasn't your place to tell anyone, parents included, what he makes. He should get a prenatal agreement to protect himself!", "Are your family members outspoken democrats/liberals by chance?  Sounds like typical behavior for them", "YTA it's none of their business. They should accept him regardless of his salary. If they change just because of his salary it still makes them AHs.", "YTA.\n\nYou made a promise.\n\nYou BROKE that promise.\n\nHow can your fianc\u00e9 EVER trust you again when you exposed his finances for all to see?", "YTA. Personal finances are PERSONAL. He doesn't want that info out, it shouldn't be out. Period. Doesn't matter how it would change how your family views him, and that's probably why he doesn't want people knowing. So he can see a more true reflection of who people are. Even you though you had a earned more, \"better job\" I believe you siad. And your family getting so into your relationship that you get so emotional you start blurting out your fianc\u00e9's secrets could be a test you failed. Are they still trying to convince you to draft a prenuptial agreement now that they know he alone makes more that their household combined? Probably not, right? You guys should though, he doesn't deserve to lose half or more of what he has worked for. Don't let shitty people influence you, even family can be shitty people. Usually the shittiest.", "YTA - He asked you for one thing and you didn't follow through.\n\nYour family doesn't get to be mad about you \"keeping secrets\" as your husband to be's income is none of their business, at all.  He probably wanted it secret because he knows when people find out, they will expect him to foot all of the bills.  I would bet money this is how your family starts treating him.\n\nYou will see that their treatment of him is not dependent on financials because they are snobs.  You need to make sure they start treating your husband with kindness and respect both in front of him and you.  Why haven't you, yet?\n\nFurthermore, you never should have let things get this far.  As soon as they called him a ditch digger the first time, you should have told them they will speak of him with respect and kindness or they won't get to speak to you at all.  You waited until things were already at a boiling point to defend your fiance.\n\nApologize to your fiance.  Tell your family if they utter one more negative thing about your fiance, or mention his finances EVER they will not get to talk to you or ever see any future grandchildren.  Forget being invited to the wedding as they can't keep a civil tongue in the heads. Follow this up with going NC with them for a few weeks.\n\nThis is salvageable but you need to realize that when you marry this man you've created a family, and that family and its secrets are your first priority, not your parents and relatives.

They are still gonna judge others over how much they make.", "YTA you were not supposed to tell anyone about his wealth", "Yta why do you think about his salary enough that it's so close to your tongue in an argument?

Your parents are bigger ones. \n\nYou should have had a conversation earlier, when you were calm, to stop the snide comments toward your fiance or learned to let them roll off your back like your fiance seems to have. \n\nYour parents need to stop judging everyone by their perceived income. It's ridiculous and elitist. They also should not be mad at you for 'keeping secrets' when it's basic information that should be expected to be kept between a couple. They are mad that they judged him wrongly and now he knows what they think of him instead of being able to suck up to their loaded future SIL. \n\nApologise profusely to your fiance. He wants people to judge him for who he is, not how much he earns, so he keeps that private. Now that your parents know, I doubt there is a chance of that information staying quiet.

But a soft one. \n\nYou should apologize for telling your family and going against his wishes. But also Tell him why - it was in the heat of the moment and you said something stupid, but it was because you wanted to make a hard boundary to your snobbish parents.

But you should not have gone against his wish and disclose his earnings, even if it was in the Spur of the moment.", "You weren\u2019t defending him, you were defending yourself. For that, YTA.

My guess is he is not interested in the way that your family thinks\u2014does not want to compete with braggarts, or be praised by them. You were raised under that, so it's a learning curve for you to start calling out how crass and small-minded your family members are rather than trying to defend your fianc\u00e9.

When we started dating, he was vague about his job and I just chalked it up to him being insecure about me having a better career. I didn\u2019t care about our income imbalance. When we got serious, we talked about our future plans and that was when he told me the full extent of his little construction company. I was shocked that his construction earnings is as much as my dad\u2019s surgeon salary. Gradually he took me around to the handful of construction lots and shopping centers he owns. His rental income combined with his construction earnings is double that of my dad\u2019s. He said that few people know about his finances and he expects me to keep what I know to myself.\n\nMy parents disapproved of him since the 1st time I brought him home. My dad coined the term \u201ctool boy\u201d and the rest of my family joined in whenever they talk behind my fianc\u00e9\u2019s back. They don\u2019t call him that to his face but instead make snide remarks. Once my mom said during dinner that they\u2019re thinking about hiring someone to mow their lawn then turned to my fianc\u00e9 and asked him what he charges.

During our shouting, I blurted out his earnings and that he makes more than both of them combined then I stormed out.

I would only allow one joke towards my fiance and that would be the last one, or my family would never see me again. You should have confronted them before, but about being classists and only after money, not attempting to show how you husband is not POOR.\nI just read classism everywhere.", "YTA You knew he wanted his finances kept private.\n\nBut you're also an asshole because they should be giving him respect *as a person*, not because his worth is tied to his income or education.

He treats me and y'all with kindness and respect, and if you cannot do the same, then I will not be spending time around you.\" Then you leave if they push back. \n\n When they call him a demeaning name, you tell them you will not stand by and see the person you love disrespected, and you leave. When they make jokes at his expense, you tell them that you are disappointed that they are so materialistic and mean-spirited, and you leave. \n\nDo you plan on raising kids around people with that attitude?

You should have put a stop to your awful family a long time ago. You know that they call your SO 'tool boy' and you haven't told them to shut that? And then, when you defend him you do so by saying he makes lots of money. That's sad, really.

The OP's family members are toxic, superficial narcissists and she should limit her contact with them.  I don't think she's an AH. Her loss of composure was understandable but she shouldn't put herself in a situation to have to defend her fiance or herself.  She should apologize to her fiance and definitely not invite them to the wedding. They will be the a-holes at the wedding criticizing every little thing behind her back.  If their behavior changes for the better will it be due to realizing they were being horrible OR because they now know the fiance makes enough money to be accepted by them?
