I instantly fell for him when he pulled up in his truck and couldn\u2019t keep my eyes off of him for the rest of the day as he gave orders to his men. When we started dating, he was vague about his job and I just chalked it up to him being insecure about me having a better career. I didn\u2019t care about our income imbalance. When we got serious, we talked about our future plans and that was when he told me the full extent of his little construction company. I was shocked that his construction earnings is as much as my dad\u2019s surgeon salary. Gradually he took me around to the handful of construction lots and shopping centers he owns. His rental income combined with his construction earnings is double that of my dad\u2019s. He said that few people know about his finances and he expects me to keep what I know to myself.\n\nMy parents disapproved of him since the 1st time I brought him home. My dad coined the term \u201ctool boy\u201d and the rest of my family joined in whenever they talk behind my fianc\u00e9\u2019s back. They don\u2019t call him that to his face but instead make snide remarks. Once my mom said during dinner that they\u2019re thinking about hiring someone to mow their lawn then turned to my fianc\u00e9 and asked him what he charges. I always try to defend him and it\u2019s a constant battle. It\u2019s gotten worse since we\u2019re planning our wedding and the other day my nerves just broke. Yesterday parents were trying to get me into getting a prenuptial then my dad said, \u201cyou have to protect your assets just in case tool boy decides to go slumming.\u201d\n\nI lost it and yelled at my parents. During our shouting, I blurted out his earnings and that he makes more than both of them combined then I stormed out. I told my fianc\u00e9 what happened but instead of supporting me, he got mad that I told his parents that. I argued that I was defending him then we got into an argument.\n\nMy parents and family are mad at me for keeping secrets. My fianc\u00e9 is mad at me for not keeping secrets. I\u2019m stuck in the middle and don\u2019t know what to do.", "created_utc": 1691935075, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15pzlkm/aita_for_telling_my_family_how_much_my_fianc\u00e9/", "score": 9115, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'd suggest to apologize to your fiance profusely, explain the entire context and situation, and ask if there is a way to make it up to him. Also, tell him you are going to work on ways and failsafes to never be in a position to blurt out confidential information again, and invite him to help you out with this. You will be husband and wife, and mistakes (even serious ones) will be made. This is your trial run to see if you can work together to rise above it, and improve on both the personal level and the joint one. Also, I'd consider just revoking your family's invitations to the wedding if they don't apologize to your husband for the attitude, to his face and behind his back. You don't need these toxic people in your life. They have already poisoned it before it's even begun.", "YTA kind of, but you come by it honestly because your parents are major dicks. Not sure how a marriage could work out with them calling the potential father of your children names and saying he\u2019s going to run off.", "YTA. To be clear, you are not TA for embarrassing your family by proving that they\u2019re snobs (they are), but you are TA for sharing information that your fianc\u00e9 *expressly asked you to keep private.*\n\nYour excuse is that you were defending him and so he shouldn\u2019t be mad, but you didn\u2019t tell your family about his finances for *his* benefit, you did it because *you* were frustrated with the snide comments and it made *your* life easier and meant *you* didn\u2019t have to deal with it anymore. \n\nThere are some things that are yours to to tell, and some things that aren\u2019t.  You shared private information about someone else, information that you had been asked to keep to yourself, for your benefit. That makes you TA, and you owe your fianc\u00e9 an apology and some damage control with your family.", "Im going to say ISH, weddings are stressful, and it sounds like you\u2019re under a massive amount of stress from your family. Technically YTA, but, I don\u2019t think you should be treated harshly for breaking under that stress. However your fianc\u00e9 needs to loosen up a little, it\u2019s not something to get that mad about.\n\n  Im curious, has your fianc\u00e9 explained why he keeps it quiet? I personally don\u2019t do business with or allow many of my family members to know my finances. Most are good people. But others will beg or borrow(steal) money, or create\nNightmare drama.", "YTA. He gave one clear instruction... Do not tell other people his income.\n\nYou had a tanty and threw it in your parents' faces, instead of just telling them that they need to stfu or not come to your wedding.\n\nI hope he makes you sign a prenup if you haven't broken his trust too much for him to marry you.", "I think NTA , sometimes you blurt things out in the heat of the moment especially when you are defending someone you care about. Your parents are definitely being AH\u2019s though", "NTA, your fianc\u00e9e seems a bit strange for never clearing this up, but would your family believe him if he did? - Seems unlikely.\n\nYour parents are TA here. You are in the middle of the argument.\n\nI would have gotten the prenup to shut your family up, if you hubby agrees, after all it would protect you both financially - your husband to be would benefit more than you because he makes more than you.", "YTA, yeah. This is private information, he asked you to keep secret, and you blurted it out cos you lost your temper. I can understand being frustrated with your parents. However you fucked with your relationship with your partner. Which matters more here.\n\nYou didn\u2019t have to share the earning, you could be vague and coy. You could have done a number of things. But your personal obsession with numbers and measuring people by their financial income - obviously inherited from your parents and with little work done on yourself to fix - meant it sounds like you revealed specifics too.\n\nYou\u2019re not stuck in the middle. You fucked up. You have private and confidential info and there were other ways to put it off. Getting angry is normal. Shouting out the exact amount your partner earns because you and your family have an elitist idea of what gives value, is not normal. \n\nGood luck.", "YTA\n\nHe asked you not to talk about it to anyone, but stroking your hurt ego was more important than his comfort and trust. Honestly, do you think he can trust you with opening up to you, knowing that you\u2019ll tell anyone his secrets in order to make yourself look good and worthy to live up to your family\u2019s ridiculous superiority complex? Do you realize that to him, he just realized that you care more about money and status and not really about him?", "Sorry to tell you this but you are the ass, you fianc\u00e9 asked you to keep this to yourself and you failed simply because you need your families approval. If he is that successful, he smart enough to read people and their behaviors, he already knows how your family feels and doesn\u2019t allow that to bother him. He is a proud man who knows who he is, and needs approval from no one. You should learn from him\u2026..if he chooses to keep you around.", "NTA. Everybody else sucks. Your family are snobby assholes. Your fianc\u00e9 is an asshole for making you keep a secret that really doesn\u2019t need to be that secretive from his soon to be in-laws. Most in-laws want to be sure you\u2019ll be able to take care of their daughter. He can but doesn\u2019t want them to know? That\u2019s dumb. I can see keeping finances a secret from the rest of the world, and he doesn\u2019t even have to go as far as opening the books and proving it, just tell them to \u201crelax in the knowledge that I make well into six figures\u201d. \n\nTelling your soon to be wife to keep secrets from her family isn\u2019t cool. It\u2019s not like a life-altering secret.", "You're a bit of an asshole for breaking your fiance's trust. Your parents and family are giant assholes. But I don't get why your fiance is so secretive about his finances given that he's marrying into the family. Is he running something illegal?", "NTA - idk why your fianc\u00e9e is being super weird about this and your parents are an ah generally as humans.", "Yta", "Well, your family sure sucks. I'm sorry.", "Soft YTA for sharing your fiance's secret. \n\nI assume that by now you have seen how he lives and know that what he says is true? There is very good money in construction (for the owner) so there is certainly no reason why it could not true.\n\nIf your fiance is a good man and has nothing to hide, he will forgive you if you are truly apologetic. Now that you are talking marriage, your parents should know that he makes a respectable income and does not need to mow lawns to pick up extra income. \n\nIf your fiance cannot forgive you, he is a hothead that you wouldn't want to be married to anyway, or he is not telling you the truth about his income and assets. \n\nPlease let us know how it works out and if you are forgiven.", "YTA: He asked you not to share that info. You could have yelled at them for being shallow or saying \u201cIf you can\u2019t respect him, we don\u2019t have to visit.\u201d All you did was reinforce the idea that money equals respect", "I wouldn\u2019t call you an asshole, but you should have kept the secret. It\u2019s perfectly possible to defend your choice of mate without divulging that piece of information. If my family ever disrespected someone I cared about like that, they\u2019d be picking their jaws up off the floor. Which is probably why they don\u2019t.", "NTA but your fiance is due an apology, he didn't want his business out there. But I understand why you did it in the heat of the moment. Also your family is full of assholes omg, I'm glad you turned out normal because wtf.", "YTA, and sadly you can't put this toothpaste back in the tube. \n\nI don't think you should be feeling caught in the middle; you don't owe this type of information to your parents. The person you should concentrate on making amends to is your fianc\u00e9.", "YTA. Your fianc\u00e9 set a clear and reasonable boundary and you violated it because you're still trying to get your parents' approval. Why are you allowing them to make snide comments to your fianc\u00e9 in the first place? Like you, I come from a very educated and professional family and my parents look down on my SO because he's not university educated. I made it very clear to them that he was off limits and I don't bring him into contact with them. I have also severely restricted my contact with my parents for the same reason. You need to stand up for your fianc\u00e9 or he will get fed up and leave", "YTA. It wasn't your place to tell anyone, parents included, what he makes. He should get a * prenup agreement to protect himself!", "Are your family members outspoken democrats/liberals by chance?  Sounds like typical behavior for them especially if your fianc\u00e9 is conservative leaning which since he does actual labor and is very humble about it, I\u2019m guessing he is.", "YTA it's none of their business. They should accept him regardless of his salary. If they change just because of his salary it still makes them AHs.", "YTA.\n\nYou made a promise.\n\nYou BROKE that promise.\n\nHow can your fianc\u00e9 EVER trust you again when you exposed his finances for all to see?", "YTA. Personal finances are PERSONAL. He doesn't want that info out, it shouldn't be out. Period. Doesn't matter how it would change how your family views him, and that's probably why he doesn't want people knowing. So he can see a more true reflection of who people are. You're still, even now, condescending about his career he built, his \"little construction company\" as you said. Even you thought you earned more, \"him being insecure about his career\" I believe you siad. And your family getting so into your relationship that you get so emotional you start blurting out your fianc\u00e9's secrets could be a test you failed. Are they still trying to convince you to draft a prenuptial agreement now that they know he alone makes more that their household combined? Probably not, right? You guys should though, he doesn't deserve to lose half or more of what he has worked for. Don't let shitty people influence you, even family can be shitty people. Usually the shittiest.", "YTA - He asked you for one thing and you didn't follow through.\n\nYour family doesn't get to be mad about you \"keeping secrets\" as your husband to be's income is none of their business, at all.  He probably wanted it secret because he knows when people find out, they will expect him to foot all of the bills.  I would bet money this is how your family starts treating him.\n\nYou will see that their treatment of him is not dependent on financials because they are snobs.  You need to make sure they start treating your husband with kindness and respect both in front of him and you.  Why haven't you, yet?\n\nFurthermore, you never should have let things get this far.  As soon as they called him a ditch digger the first time, you should have told them they will speak of him with respect and kindness or they won't get to speak to you at all.  You waited until things were already at a boiling point to defend your fiance.\n\nApologize to your fiance.  Tell your family if they utter one more negative thing about your fiance, or mention his finances EVER they will not get to talk to you or ever see any future grandchildren.  Forget being invited to the wedding as they can't keep a civil tongue in the heads. Follow this up with going NC with them for a few weeks.\n\nThis is salvageable but you need to realize that when you marry this man you've created a family, and that family and its secrets are your first priority, not your parents and relatives.

You need to make this up to your fiance because he's the only one not being an Ah here.", "Fianc\u00e9 is the only reasonable one here.", "He's keeping it a secret because he don't want to people to treat him better just because he makes a lot of money I'm surprised you haven't figured that out.\nYour parents looking down on his job made it even more reasonable decision to not to tell them. Telling them solved nothing. They are still gonna judge others over how much they make.", "YTA you were not supposed to tell anyone about his wealth", "Yta why do you think about his salary enough that it's so close to your tongue in an argument?

Some people actually do truly enjoy \u201cbest revenge is living well.\u201d He cares about YOU, and still shows face around your jerk of an entitled snob family.

Or does he not care because he knows they're wrong?", "Gentle YTA. Your parents are bigger ones. \n\nYou should have had a conversation earlier, when you were calm, to stop the snide comments toward your fiance or learned to let them roll off your back like your fiance seems to have. \n\nYour parents need to stop judging everyone by their perceived income. It's ridiculous and elitist. They also should not be mad at you for 'keeping secrets' when it's basic information that should be expected to be kept between a couple. They are mad that they judged him wrongly and now he knows what they think of him instead of being able to suck up to their loaded future SIL. \n\nApologise profusely to your fiance. He wants people to judge him for who he is, not how much he earns, so he keeps that private. Now that your parents know, I doubt there is a chance of that information staying quiet.

If your fiance is 'the' guy, he'll absorb it...he's obviously very sensitive about his personal wealth and didn't it influencing others' views of him for any number of reasons.  That said...your family are elitists and are 'demanding' information that they have no right to know.\n\nSit down with your fiance and simply apologize and explain that you eventually 'broke' under the constant family bombardment about your future together.  And that while what you did was in fact wrong...that you truly were just trying to defend him to the family dynamic.  Again...if he really is the guy, he'll get over this relatively slight mistake on your part.\n\nGood luck...", "Sound like a dream. \n\nI admire anyone that has skills and uses them.  A good surgeon's skills are no more valuable than a good contractor's.", "Sorry OP, but YTA for two reasons.  First, you did exactly what he asked you not to.  Second, and far more importantly, you have not cut off contact with your idiot blood relatives.

If you\u2019re unable to respect myself and my partner, then there is absolutely no need for you to be around,\u2019* you told them his financial status!\n\nDoes the number in his account somehow make him a better person?

Who exactly are they??** \n\nBut now they know, and for people so focused on having money, knowing he has it will absolutely not stop the conversation. \n\nI am a person with multiple degrees, and so is pretty much everyone of my family, and I simply *DO NOT* understand measuring peoples value based on that. There are plenty of white collar people who are absolutely awful human beings and I feel deeply for this dude that is suffering the gross actions of your rude family (because there\u2019s no way the \u2018little\u2019 digs are going unnoticed) only for you to share his private financial information with a bunch of people who determined him to be less than.\n\nYour family is the problem here, because I\u2019m willing to be their demeanor toward him will shift completely.

But a soft one. \n\nYou should apologize for telling your family and going against his wishes. But also Tell him why - it was in the heat of the moment and you said something stupid, but it was because you wanted to make a hard boundary to your snobbish parents. Normally, when in laws are having issues woth the Partner of their child, it is the duty of the child to Call them off. So that is something you did good. But you should not have gone against his wish and disclose his earnings, even if it was in the Spur of the moment.", "You weren\u2019t defending him, you were defending yourself. For that, YTA. He was very clear about his personal financial business. You crossed his boundary because you\u2019re just as much a snob as your family.", "YTA. You did not set the correct boundaries with your family. You betrayed your fiancee AND you let them denigrate him at every opportunity. And you spout off about how much better you and your family is.

My guess is he is not interested in the way that your family thinks\u2014does not want to compete with braggarts, or be praised by them. You were raised under that, so it's a learning curve for you to start calling out how crass and small-minded your family members are rather than trying to defend your fianc\u00e9.

They might just keep pumping themselves up about their \"better education.\"  Your parents are not mad at your for keeping secrets, they are mad at your because they are all TAs and feel at least a little bit called out on that.

I instantly fell for him when he pulled up in his truck and couldn\u2019t keep my eyes off of him for the rest of the day as he gave orders to his men. When we started dating, he was vague about his job and I just chalked it up to him being insecure about me having a better career. I didn\u2019t care about our income imbalance. When we got serious, we talked about our future plans and that was when he told me the full extent of his little construction company. I was shocked that his construction earnings is as much as my dad\u2019s surgeon salary. Gradually he took me around to the handful of construction lots and shopping centers he owns. His rental income combined with his construction earnings is double that of my dad\u2019s. He said that few people know about his finances and he expects me to keep what I know to myself.\n\nMy parents disapproved of him since the 1st time I brought him home. My dad coined the term \u201ctool boy\u201d and the rest of my family joined in whenever they talk behind my fianc\u00e9\u2019s back. They don\u2019t call him that to his face but instead make snide remarks. Once my mom said during dinner that they\u2019re thinking about hiring someone to mow their lawn then turned to my fianc\u00e9 and asked him what he charges. I always try to defend him and it\u2019s a constant battle. It\u2019s gotten worse since we\u2019re planning our wedding and the other day my nerves just broke.

During our shouting, I blurted out his earnings and that he makes more than both of them combined then I stormed out. I told my fianc\u00e9 what happened but instead of supporting me, he got mad that I told his parents that. I argued that I was defending him then we got into an argument.\n\nMy parents and family are mad at me for keeping secrets. My fianc\u00e9 is mad at me for not keeping secrets.

Trades careers, and physical labor, are looked down on, and way undervalued.\n\nPlus, of course -- just as in the central point of THIS post, we also shouldn't judge the worth of those trades jobs based on how much money they make. But it can be really, REALLY hard to separate our thinking from that idea, because it's so baked into the culture and we're raised in references to it from the earliest age.\n\nLike: being a garbage collector is objectively VITAL to our society functioning, especially if you live in more densely-populated areas.  We should be bowing down to the people who are willing to DO that job, because I tell you what, I wouldn't really want to, between the physical nature of it, the heat, the smell, and coming in contact with a lot of the grossest stuff you can possibly imagine (and a lot of stuff you can't even imagine).\n\nBut people often only \"value\" those jobs if they find out it pays better than they thought it would.

He may simply want to be very private about his finances.  He may even be concerned that once people find out how much he makes, a family like hers would expect to get \"favors\" from him, related to his job, because \"come on, you can afford it\". etc.  There are plenty of reasons for him to want her to keep quiet about his private business, that aren't just \"he has a much more progressive view of value vs. money than she does or her family does\".)\n\nHe's still in the right to be pissed off at her for breaking her promise to him.", "This!

This is something she needs to work on for herself as well as her relationship (hopefully this one but a future one if fianc\u00e9 can\u2019t get past this).\n\nDefinitely.  But OP doesn't say what their ages are.  It sounds like both OP and her fiance are likely not super young -- you don't get to a business level like he has in your early 20s, most likely.\n\nStill.  I find that people can be way too harsh about \"you didn't automatically know how toxic the beliefs you were raised with are, and you didn't work on that as much as you should have so that you were PERFECT in outlook by the time you became a full adult\".  It's so easy for strangers to sit there on the internet -- not having to reveal any of their OWN faults -- and ding someone for not detoxifying faster. \n\nAnd the thing is -- that, itself, is toxic.  I see this in online spaces way too often, and it doesn't matter how old someone is (if they're a teen, or an adult of any age).  They were raised with fucked-up beliefs.  They \\*absorbed\\* fucked up beliefs from the fucked up society that surrounds everyone.  But then they start to realize that and start to want to get better.  And what are they met with?  \"Why didn't you do this EARLIER?\"  \n\nToo many people in online spaces don't actually encourage people to detoxify their beliefs, and learn better. They just castigate them for not doing it sooner.  And, very often, they STILL hold their old beliefs against them.\n\nSo yeah -- saying that she needs to do more work, still, to unpack and unlearn the toxic beliefs she was obviously raised with: absolutely true.  \n\nBut putting it in a negative way, emphasizing that she should have been doing this long before this point: also true, but not particularly helpful.\n\n(Especially because, this attitude that attaches someone's worth to the job they have and the money they make is not something she ONLY learned from her family.  Assuming she's in the U.S. in particular, our culture is STEEPED in it.  It's all around us.  \"You  better get good grades or you'll end up in a yucky, menial job, like driving a garbage truck\", etc.  That both ignores the enormous value that trash collection gives to our society, and is also ignorant of the fact that various trades can pay well.  And the latter shouldn't matter in terms of someone's worth, but when you strip away the pure classism and bigotry of those thoughts, you also find an underlying fear about how much people need to make, not just to be valued by society, but to survive in it with any degree of comfort.)\n\nAnyway, my  point is that yeah, OP is a bit late to waking up to how truly awful her family is. (I also have no patience with the people who sit there and pretend that it's so easy to just cut off your entire family.)  I hope she can repair this with her fiance.

Especially when finances are involved (idk if they are here but based on how they act I'm just going to assume), younger siblings, ailing or aging relatives that you could be cut off from, etc. We don't know what else is going on in the family that might be keeping her from cutting them off. But beyond that, it's really just flat out not reasonable to say \"they're extremely rude so you're spineless for not shutting it down completely forever or cutting them out of your life entirely\" that's just silly. \nAnd I say all this as someone who is NC with my ENTIRE family on both sides.", "People be crazy on here. But I loveet \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "Excellent.", "Yep, that can be for the good but damn, it can alienate the cousins. I don't think no contact should be the go-to responde to every single problem in a family.", "Yep, I wanted to make this comment. People on Reddit are so quick to say, cut off your family, get divorced, etc", "It's 'do as I say, not as I do', except they're stupid 20yr olds with little life experience... On the internet", "People on reddit don't understand just how hard that is emotionally. Like my dad was abused by his parents his whole life and he still holds a relationship with them because he can't not. He doesn't have it in him. I would like to cut my mom out of my life but I know I won't because it's not that easy.", "You should apologize to your fiance, but I understand losing it and yelling at your parents. YTA\n\nEdit: actually YTA", "Shallow people with no character value money. You and your entire family are assholes.", "YTA. Apologize to your fianc\u00e9. \n\nYour family are AH for looking down on everything and everyone.", "YTA, for a couple reasons. 1) the fact that you continue to allow them to belittle him. 2) that you would violate his privacy by revealing how much money he makes. \n\nIf my family treated my fianc\u00e9 like that I would have cut contact with them years ago. It\u2019s a simple as \u201cif you continue to treat him like this I will no longer be in your life.\u201d", "YTA you may think that you were defending him but did he ever ask? Maybe he doesn't mind what they say at all? Could it be that you were defending your choice of choosing him instead of actually defending him?", "You sound so pretentious describing his career and company. Are you really shocked that your family thinks the same things you do? \n\nYou and your family are the assholes.", "Thank you for articulating what I was thinking, that OP's fiance is probably secretly enjoying OP's parents underestimating him.\n\nThis is where I think the fiance is a little bit TA. OP may have agreed to their deal not to disclose his finances, and stuck to it for a long time. But here's the thing. Now that they are getting married, it's not longer just his finances...it will be *their* finances. I don't think it's fair of him to ask OP to keep the secret forever. What a stressful position to be in! OP's family are being awful snobs, but every time the couple purchases something in the future, they will likely make remarks about it draining OP's savings, etc, and knowing that I would think OP's fiance would *want* to put an end to the secret in order to shield his *future spouse* from her parent's judgemental comments. But he won't because...he just doesn't want to? \n\nIt sounds like OP snapped under the pressure and just blurted it out, and I think OP's fiance should not have let the situation progress to that point without releasing OP from the promise and telling them himself.", "Best answer and a great response. To the point but vague", "But at this point, I think her parents are right. They should get a prenup, but moreso to protect his assets from her and her family.", "Wrong on the point that she hasn\u2019t said anything before; \u201cI always try to defend him, but it\u2019s a constant battle\u201d. It would seem she\u2019s more or less tried what you wrote already and that it has fallen on deaf ears, but that the latest comment was the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back. \n\nFamily dynamics are tricky and no so cut and dry, so it\u2019s easy for an internet stranger to dictate how OP should act, without regard for whatever else dynamics there are at play here. Not everyone find it easy or simple to just cut off family like a limb, as it seems to be for some of the people suggesting it here.\n\nUnintentionally A H, but leaning to NTA.\nBut sure, OP should still apologise to her fianc\u00e9 for her impulsive outburst in the heat of the moment.", "I\u2019m going to go with an extra helping of AH for the fianc\u00e9 as well, even though it won\u2019t be popular.\n\nWhen he heard that his \u2018secret\u2019 is out, and that the family was talking shit about him, he should have just said \u2018screw them, minimal contact\u2019. He\u2019s free to hate them, scorn them, whatever - they are the biggest AH here, in an unforgivable way. He doesn\u2019t have to buy them each a Rolex every Xmas or pay for family vacations. He can just say \u2018you are a doctor, but your own watch and I\u2019ll buy mine\u2019. And he knows that any friendship they offer is two-faced - that\u2019s very valuable knowledge.\n\nHis annoyance with OP for losing her shit is something he needs to get over, quickly. If he can\u2019t let go, this is just the first of 99 traumas their marriage will deliver. He (seemingly) needs relationship skills, badly.", "I\u2019m amazed how easy some people here think it is to cut off family like it\u2019s just another day at the park. \n\nAnd it also seems people lack some reading comprehension, because OP literally writes that she\u2019s defended him plenty of times and it\u2019s clearly fallen on deaf ears.\n\nSure, she disclosed that he earned more than them combined, but it was obviously an impulsive last ditch attempt in the heat of the moment to get her family off their backs. And sure it sucks, but it\u2019s not the bloody end of the world. It seems really dramatically presumptuous to imply that his trust has been irrevocably broken because of this, and so he shouldn\u2019t stay with her. You make it sound as if she\u2019s disclosed state secrets or something.", "Yeah I agree. I wouldn't say YTA but ESH. But more faults are on the family here. I can understand her anger but honestly I would have just uninvited them to the wedding and cut them off for good", "What is ESH?", "I don't think he's insecure... It's some form of a male ego, when he thinks he's better because he's pretending to be poor. He knew his fiancee was bullied by her family and just left her to suffer, while apparently having fun thinking he's such a good person. Also, as they are getting married, his finances are not that personal anymore and she has some rights to share the information imo\n\nOverall, the situation is not easy, and everyone sucks in some way.", "husband\u2019s income is a secret from relatives? what world do we live in? i always say how much i earn. i always casually drop how much i earn. i live in Canada. maybe in the states it\u2019s more taboo idk.", "Might be illustrative of her own foundational beliefs of a person's merit tied to their income.", "OP communicated to them to shut their bitching up, in the only way they know how to process information. They've clearly demonstrated to OP that they don't give a single shit about anything than the dollar amount.\n\nPeople sit on here and try to say \"you shoulda done X, Y,  Z\" when it's very most likely that OP *had* tried those things before.", "Are you 1 of the family members or are you just a Dunning-Kruger?  \n\n\nAll she had to do was say was \"stop insulting my partner because you think you're better than him\"  instead she revealed his secret because she has no spine to defend her partner from her family who seem like they are insufferable.", "You sound like a neckbeard", ">You have groveling to do\n\nI agree!!!", "YEs, he will always be a tool boy for them", "literally like they're saying it as if it's the easiest thing in the world! it's craayyy", "Yeah I'd go with a very soft YTA.\n\nWe all say or do things when we're mad that we regret. OP had been dealing with this for quite a while and, up until this point, had respected her fiance's wishes to not disclose his income. \n\nBut we're all human and we all make mistakes when we're angry. She made a mistake, definitely not from a malicious place, but a mistake none the less. Heart was in the right place, but actions weren't.", "Yeah this is what i was thinking. I think ppl here are being a lil too hard on op", "If someone constantly laughs in your face playing the jack of spades while you hold the ace for YEARS I can imagine it would get pretty tempting to play the one card that they truly respect and would shut them up. It was wrong but I kinda understand why she did it.", "Agreed. I have family members like this and they absolutely do not care what a person is like. All they care about is how much you make and your prestige. \n\nThese are not people who were ever going to care he was a decent person. Even now I\u2019m sure his career choices will still be looked down on because he isn\u2019t a PhD, MD, or JD. \n\nI get the fiancee is upset she told them something he asked her not to, so slight YTA for that. But also, she didn\u2019t tell a random stranger, she told her (admittedly snobby) parents. It\u2019s a little weird how secretive he is about what he does\u2026.", "As someone who has done it, at 15 no less, it was a terrible decision that haunts me to this day. I know it was the right call, because if not my life, it at least saved my mind. So yes, it is easy for me to say, because I would not say it lightly.", "No one is saying it's easy, but it can be done, I went LC/NC with my family after my second son was born because of how my mom was acting to my wife, just got to the point where I snapped after years of defending and setting her straight.\n\nAfter I went NC eventually my mom got the message and shaped up, but I told her, the minute you start acting like that again we will take a big step back. \n\nNot easy but necessary", "You're assuming she never said that before... from the tone it sounds like shes said that tons of times and they dont care...\n\nProper action of course is to just go no contact with the family cus theyre all jerks. But assuming she never got mad at them for their insults before seems a radical interpretation of the text.", "You can tell when someone hasn't read the post. Because OP literally said she's had to openly defend her fiance to her parents.", "Calling your fianc\u00e9 a derogatory name and constantly putting him down is not about a person's individual values, but their basic capacity for humanity and empathy.", "This is the most sensible reply. He's not wrong for being upset, and she's not wrong for going off. She should disinvite her family to the wedding.", "Exactly. There are plenty of things to criticize her family for and defend him without having to throw out numbers. The fact that it was her go to shows that she share similar values.", "it's actually been years of this. OP screwed up and should apologize to her fianc\u00e9, but the screw-up is understandable. however, I think they need to have a long, honest talk about their expectations with this family. I get that the fianc\u00e9 wanted to earn their respect without bringing his salary into it, but at this point I think they both need to recognize that that was always an unrealistic goal. it was just never going to happen. so now they need to figure out how they're going to handle this going forward. if the only acceptance he can ever expect is conditional, then do they want to accept that, or do they want to go low or no-contact? does OP want to remain in contact while fianc\u00e9 steers clear of these shallow, materialistic people who are incapable of respecting him outside of his income? what are the pros and cons of each possible approach?", "Okay. \ud83e\udec2", "Maybe she defended him but if my family were criticising my SO based solely on what they earned, then I\u2019d be asking them to get over themselves or I\u2019d be going NC\n\nESH except the fianc\u00e9 in my opinion", "Maybe she didn\u2019t have to use exact numbers, but a general statement like \u201che makes way more than I do!\u201d might have been a better choice.\n\nOTOH, I don\u2019t think OP is a total a-hole. Sounds like she\u2019s told them to STFU multiple times and this was the occasion where she finally snapped.", "Yeah, the way a whole generation seems to throw around this whole \"go no contact\" or \"go low contact\" with family/friends so casually, over the slightest offense, is fucking horrifying (& ridiculous). Great problem-solving & conflict resolution skills there: just cut everyone off who displeases you in the slightest.\ud83d\ude44   Life is complicated, and so are interpersonal relationships: it's not unicorns & lollipops (& instant gratification) 24/7. A lot of folks on the interwebs have some growing up to do.", "My family is full of snarky jerks.  They don't get cut off because of it, it's simply a complicated relationship that I deal with.  It's laughable that \"you need to go no contact because your parents are flawed human beings\" is considered a nature, responsible solution.", "This is 100% where my family is going on both sides. I barely know any of my cousins. One second cousin got married and I didn't get invited because I didn't invite them to my wedding (which was 20 people in Vegas so no one except immediate family got invited)  My mother's sister hates her so she's been bragging in my Mom's face for years about her more successful life and kids. Her kids/my cousins are kinda insufferable twats so when we did see them we didn't like them. So, in short, after the aunts and uncles go, there's going to be zero connection with anyone.", "A minor disagreement? OP's family treated her now fiance like absolute crap. For years. Their father made up a derogatory nickname for him behind his back. This family deserves whatever it gets. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBeing a successful professional is not a license to treat seemingly less well-off people with contempt. If anything, the father should have been glad that his child was in love with someone who put merit over money. \n\nNow that being said, while I don't believe there was any malice on the OP's part, they did break a promise to their fiance regarding finances and need to apologize profusely.", "They sound minor, but they\u2019ve been brewing for ages. Years. Im sure many WISH with everything in them that they were minor, they have been letting themselves be treated like crap and need to get out of there, to have any self worth left."]}
