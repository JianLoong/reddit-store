Our relationship is great, I know Jake loves me a lot, but there\u2019s one issue that we\u2019ve always had and it boiled over yesterday.\n\nFor context, I'm not the best cook, but I really enjoy it; it's something that brings me a lot of joy and comfort. The problem is Jake doesn\u2019t really have a massive food palette. Nevertheless, I try to make meals that he will enjoy, even though he's a picky eater and can sometimes complain about my cooking. We\u2019ve maybe had an argument once or twice over it in our entire relationship, but by the next day he\u2019ll apologize and we\u2019ll be okay again.\n\nYesterday was a hard day for me; my aunt \u2018Susan\u2019 passed away unexpectedly 3 years ago and I miss her every day. She was almost like a second mom to me, and even though she ended up moving to England when I was 12, whenever she visited I still felt the same love I always did. My husband also knows about my relationship with my aunt.\n\nMore important to this issue, whenever she flew back home, she\u2019d make an English Roast dinner; it\u2019s an amazing meal, and my aunt being an excellent cook in her own right made it perfect every time. So, as a way to combine a genuine hobby of mine and to commemorate my aunt, every year since then I make an English roast on the day (also. Jake was lucky enough to try Susan\u2019s roast dinner once, and even in spite of his fussiness, he said he loved it).\n\nIt takes me hours to prepare, and while it\u2019s never as good as hers, it\u2019s something I was really proud of and wanted to share with Jake. But yesterday, he came home from work really tired and said he wanted to order takeout from his favorite restaurant instead. I told him that I\u2019d spent hours today trying to make a great meal that I thought he liked, and that today was also the day of Susan\u2019s passing, but he suddenly snapped.\nHe got angry and accused me of being selfish and not understanding his needs. He said that I'm always making everything about myself and never put him first.\n\nAfter the work I\u2019d put into that day, I just felt incredibly guilty and ashamed. I apologized and agreed to order takeout. He made some passive-aggressive comments throughout the evening, and didn\u2019t speak to me before he went to bed, while I slept on the sofa and cried that night. He didn\u2019t mention anything today as he left for work, but it still has really bothered me.\n\nAITA? I'm just trying to get a sense of what other people's thoughts are on this. I feel like I\u2019m in the wrong for forcing this day on my husband and making a big deal out of something that I shouldn\u2019t, but I also feel that the way he made me feel wasn\u2019t fair.", "created_utc": 1674520367, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10jsf73/aita_for_getting_upset_over_my_husbands_reaction/", "score": 121, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This is the behavior of a teenager coming home from school and bitching over mom's roast that he can't have McDonald's. \n\nNTA. Whatsoever.

Its fine not to be the best cook, but youre trying and thats what matters. Hes an ungrateful AH.", "NTA Please be honest with us. In what other ways does he disrespect you? This can't be the only thing", "You're NTA. Nobody \"needs\" to order takeout. He was rude and dismissive, and it was very nervy to accuse you of being selfish and not understanding his needs. Talk about projecting. He could have had take out tomorrow.", "NTA.  Sorry for your loss.\n\nHe was inconsiderate and selfish and you didn't deserve it.  So think more about your relationship.", "Dude sounds like a dick.", "NTA - I\u2019m a terrible cook and my partner eats everything I make and always says thank you. He might give constructive criticism but I never feel like he\u2019s ungrateful that I put in effort. \n\nYour partner should be doing the same, even if for some crazy reason he *had* to get takeout, he shouldn\u2019t be snapping or making you feel bad.", "NTA at all. There is definitely something going on here other than not liking your cooking; his reaction is not even remotely appropriate. If my husband told me he wanted carry out after I told him I\u2019d spent hours preparing dinner I\u2019d be LIVID with him, not questioning what I did wrong.", "NTA stop cooking for him.", "Sorry for your loss. You putting a lot of work into cooking as both your hobby and a way to memorialize your aunt was really nice of you. NTA.\n\nYour husband is incredibly self-centered. His yelling at you and accusing him of making everything all about you was projection on his part. He made it all about him.\n\nAfter you agreed to order takeout, he should have been immensely grateful and returned the favor by being appreciative and attentive. Being withdrawn, sullen, and passive aggressive instead was an AH move on his part. His comments and behavior were incredibly unfair. You had no reason to feel guilty or ashamed.\n\nSounds like he's in the habit of abusing you and blaming you for his abuse.", "NTA it was important to you so is normal to feel upset/hurt\n\nMy advise is to try to talk to him and explain him how you feel, but also try to listen to him and ask why ordering take out was important for him. If this is not his normal behavior maybe he was also going through a difficult time and needed some confort food", "Wait, you're saying that you gave in and agreed to scrap the dinner you were making and order takeout as he wanted and he still made passive-aggressive comments and didn't speak to you before bed? \n\nYou are NTA, but he absolutely is. Something more is going on here.", "What a surprise there's an age gap", "NTA. In fact, I feel like there must be more to this or I\u2019m shocked you want to spend your life with this person. From what you wrote, he ignored your grief, made light of your hard work, cut you down and belittled you. Unless he was having a stroke or this is part of a larger issue of you ignoring his requests due to health concerns or the like, he sounds like a complete jerkface. More context or couple\u2019s counseling. If not that, therapy for you, stat. I\u2019m worried that your reaction was to feel guilt and shame, and the need to apologize.", "NTA. I'm concerned what is behind his \"making everything about you\" comment, but in this situation you are hard NTA.

Husband is a manipulator and verbally abusive. Get outta there", "NTA. He sounds like a tactless clod.", "NTA. He was acting like a total D-bag. Disregarding your feelings, disrespecting you, ungrateful ass", "NTA. He was very disrespectful of your feelings. Also, is he doing any of the cooking? If he's so picky about food, maybe he should cook sometimes. Its uncalled for to get mad at you over your cooking in general, but doing it when this dinner was clearly associated with your grief is incredibly selfish and disrespectful.", "NTA but that man does not love you. I can tell you that much.", "On the small scale, NTA. This day was a day of mourning and tradition for you, and you put a lot of effort into this and he should have been there for you as a loving husband to comfort you through the anniversary grief. He could have take out any other day of the year or at work even if he neeeeeded it today because today's dinner is for you to celebrate your late aunt. But on a larger scale, it sounds like he had some other stuff going on and he snapped because your relationship has the larger issue of selfishness. Now, I am NOT saying that is true because I have no context for it I can only go off of what is in this post, but if a partner is telling you they have been feeling emotionally neglected, it is good to at least hear them out with the goal of working together to make your relationship better. He owes you an apology for the incident, but you both owe each other some honest communication about needs that aren't being met.", "You get an A for trying but you started off here by saying that you\u2019re not the best cook so why isn\u2019t he allowed to just get food he\u2019ll enjoy? Some people look forward to a really good meal after a long day of work. It\u2019s their way of unwinding. Do you cook often?

Start paying attention to the other places where the things you love aren't valued and ways he doesn't even do the bare minimum because I doubt this is the only time.", "NTA. He came home from work to a freshly-cooked meal and wants to order take-out and then lashes out at you for wanting him to enjoy something with you that you worked so hard on?

My husband made me sit down with the kids and let us all share some fun times we had with my grandma (she was a one of a kind). Then we had some takeout since I was all out of sorts that day.

He is also a poor communicator.", "YTA, of you're going to make preparing and eating dinner into something that he has to 'react correctly' to its not OK. \n\nYou know he's got a limited palette as you say, but you still take it personally when you've spent a ton of time cooking something you know he likely won't want and he tells you as much? \n\nYou've created an ISSUE out of what should just be a normal daily ritual, eating food. You both need to take the drama out of this issue and it does seem unfair to hold him to some standard you know it's highly unlikely he'll be able to meet.", "This. Poor OP. I highly recommend therapy, OP, because I have a feeling you'll realize there are more issues in this relationship than just that he doesn't like your cooking.", "Good thing husbands whose age is closer to their wives' never disrespect them.", "Exactly.

But when it\u2019s not, one of us will just get something different to eat, or both of us if it\u2019s that bad.
