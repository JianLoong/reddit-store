Mother of girl agrees to pay damages, cost to mother is $500.\n3. Mother says she cannot pay $500, so instead her daughter gets free piano lessons.\n\nSo now, instead of being paid $500 for something that was damage, you now have to offer a service for free? How is that a compromise? You went from down $500, to being offered $500, to being told no $500 oh and do a service for free. \n\nSomeone make this make sense! NTA", "This cannot be real.  We destroyed your shit, we aren't going to pay for it, and in exchange you PAY Us to give us a valuable service for free?\n\nSeriously?  Why are you even considering this? Pay us back for damaging your things by giving us a gift.  \n\nWHY ARE YOU CONSIDERING THIS.", "INFO: As someone who took piano lessons for 10 years, how did she cause $500 worth of damage by playing the piano? \n\nSecondly, were you giving her free lessons to begin with? Because I'm a little confused why she would say she can't pay and ask for free lessons in the same breath. That makes no sense.", "I don\u2019t get it - how does giving her daughter free lessons recompense you for the repairs??? If you had damaged her car or something like that, I can see how giving her daughter free lessons could be done in exchange. But I think she has this ass-backwards. \n\nNTA. Also, don\u2019t worry so much about what other people think about you. Most likely if they know you, they\u2019re not going to believe her, especially if they know her at all.", "NTA  \n\nI get you feel for the kid who has a passion for music.  So does my kid, so I bought a cheap keyboard, and they use free online lessons (as I can't afford a professional teacher for then)\n\nIt is not your responsibility to teach anyone for free,  especially someone who has damaged your property.", "NTA. How on earth does the mom think free lessons somehow pays off her debt for the damage? Totally separate issues. It was an accident and that sucks, how did it happen? You teach lessons.. you\u2019re taking some risk there with accidents. Perhaps the most equitable thing to do is split the cost of the repair?", "NTA\u2026\n\nThis is your job and it\u2019s how you bring in income. \n\nYou offered payment plans and a discount, which is more than reasonable. \n\nWhile it\u2019s sad that this child\u2019s family can\u2019t afford lessons when she passionate about learning, she can find other ways to learn.", "NTA\nI was confused too by not being able to pay for the damage and wanting free lessons on top.\nJust. No. Absolutely not.", "You should have used your primary, as there is nothing to be ashamed about on your part.\n\n\n\n\nYour property was damaged.  You could have sued in small claims, but chose to try to work out the bill with the legal guardian of the kid who destroyed your property.  When her mother could not come up with the money, you tried to further accommodate her by giving her a payment plan, along with lessons, but for your kindness your reputation got trashed by this woman.  Her behavior is reprehensible.\n\n\n\n\nTake her to small claims, get reimbursed, or at least a judgement against her.", "Info: how old is the child? How did she damage it?

Was the damage not intentional, but the result of mis-behaviour (as opposed to ignorant mis-use)?\n\nAs a piano teacher you have a certain responsibility to be aware and teach students how to use a piano without damaging it. Depending on the circumstances of what caused the damage, you might be at least partially responsible.", "Wow - this is a lot.\n\nTo summarize w/ comments and post:\n\n1) You were giving free lessons to this child already because your daughter and her are friends. \n2) During this free lesson she ruined one of the keys because you weren\u2019t supervising closely enough.\n3) The mother agreed to pay for the damage, and then later said she couldn\u2019t. Then asked if they could continue the free lessons regardless. (Wow!)\n4) You declined and offered a solution for the damage like a payment plan and said that you wanted her to pay for lessons going forward.\n\nYeah - ESH.\n\nMom - because she shouldn\u2019t have offered to pay, and then reneged. And she should be ashamed to ask for free lessons when her daughter ruined the piano during her last set of free lessons. And for spreading rumors.\n\nDaughter - at seven years old, you know not to open stuff up and mess around. Much less with water near expensive equipment. My four-year-old knows this.\n\nYou - because you should\u2019ve never left the lesson at all, because you really never should\u2019ve done free lessons to begin with, because you\u2019re asking for the repair AND for payment of lessons now.\n\nIn the future:\nOffer a certain number of piano lessons free, and then state your fee after the trial run. That way people can make an informed decision.\n\nDon\u2019t leave the lessons on attended.\n\nTell the neighbor that due to your error, you\u2019ll cover the cost of the fee to repair the piano. But that you can no longer offer free lessons to *anyone* beyond the short trial period of x lessons.\n\nEdited: typo", "Was the mother paying you for the lesson the day that the child broke the piano? I think the mother sounds very reasonable, it was nice of her to offer to pay. Many wouldn't have. You should have said 5/10 free lessons instead of a discount and a payment plan. \n\n\nI'm leaning towards YTA, based on how you handled it", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That being said, I can't blame you for not wanting to give the girl piano lessons anymore as she damaged your piano and there's a chance it might happen again in the future. Also, the Mom of the little girl sounds extremely entitled not just for refusing to pay for the damages that her daughter caused, but for asking that you to give up even more money by giving her daughter free lessons when you're a professional music teacher. Imagine the audacity, \"I'm sorry my daughter damaged your piano while playing on it. She obviously damaged it because she doesn't know how to play the piano properly, so maybe if you give her some lessons then she won't damage it in the future. Oh, but I shouldn't have to pay for the lessons because you teaching her how to properly pay is the payment itself.\" No matter how you look at it OP, this woman's reasoning doesn't make even the slightest bit of sense, and I'm glad you didn't cave to her ridiculous demands.", "I\u2019m confused as to how the child did that much damage while you were giving her lessons.  \n\nAs the instructor of any kind of lesson one of the first things you need to teach is \u201cdon\u2019t do this\u201d or \u201conly do it this way\u201d so you know kids won\u2019t damage things or get hurt. \n\nIf you let her loose on a piano and she damaged that much I have to wonder how.", "NTA Any child old enough to take lessons is old enough to know not to touch things that aren't theirs. The mother not only refuses to pay for the damage but wants you to provide free lessons? And her response to all suggestions instead of at least trying  to compensate you for the damage is to spread rumors about you? No, you are definitely not the AH.", "OP - NTA.   I love that fact you desire to help a passionate child develop her interest.   You've also admitted culpability (at least here) as you left the child to her own devices due to an urgent phone call.  Things happen when you least expect it.\n\nBUT, the mother is out of line and just wants things for free.  First, she said that she'd reimburse you for the damage then later on is trying to barter down to no restitution and free lessons. THEN, she has the audacity to talk about you behind your back - all of which affects your livelihood.   You tried to be creative with solutions and but due to fear of additional attacks, you've been forced to use a throwaway account.  What is to say she wouldn't be doing this if your piano hadn't sustained costly damage?\n\nI feel for the little girl but before you help her - think of this:  you can't support others when you aren't supported yourself..", "Wow, the audacity of that parent to not pay for the damage to your piano AND THEN ask for free lessons on top of that.   \n\nNTA!", "Wait, is this like when you borrow 500 from a person and agree to pay it back by borrowing another 500? I love that.... I just can never find anyone gullible enough to do it.", "Humans confuse me more everyday I swear \n\nHow does someone\u2019s thought process get to give my kid free lessons \u2026 after telling you they\u2019re unable to pay the money they owe you \n\nObvs NTA but also .. just wtf \ud83d\ude05", "Thank youuuuu!!! Lol same line of thought like whoa whoa whoa whoa. What?! No. Absolutely not", "I believe they were already having free lessons (which would still be awfully kind from OP). At least that's how I understood it. So the mother wants to go back to those free lessons instead of paying the $500.", "So, technically you would've been at a loss of 500 plus the amount of piano lessons, should you have agreed for the free lessons. There's no way you are the asshole.", "That's where I'm hung up, too. Why is the mother asking for free lessons? It would be like someone going to a restaurant without any money, and instead of offering to wash the dishes to pay for the meal, they demand that the restaurant pay *them*. The mother's reasoning is completely backwards!\n\nI understand that you don't want to punish the little girl for an accident, OP, but giving her free lessons or discounted lessons makes absolutely no sense in this scenario.", "I don't know anything about pianos, but is it possible to severely damage a piano from normal use? If it is possible, wouldn't all of the hours of playing on the piano previously trigger the eventual damage? This one confused me.", "I Felt like the daughter really wanted to learn the piano lessons. By denying them I Basically ruined her motivation to continue piano lessons.", "As her piano teacher, This may be my fault but I had to go leave the room for a little amount of time because of an urgent phone call and In that time she got curious and opened the piano to see how it works, The piano broke in that time. I trusted her to be responsible and did not micromanage her, This is my fault in the end.\n\nI was giving her free piano lessons because the mother and her daughter have been my neighbors for over 6 years.", "I was going to ask the same thing. Worst that happened to our piano was a sticky key or it going out of tune. Can't blame one person for that", "I thought that was a typo. Like she paid the 500 and then asked for free classes. Doesn't make any sense otherwise!", "This is also what I was wondering\u2026.how do free lessons equate to a damaged piano?", "She is 7 years old.\n\nShe damaged the piano by opening it while i had to attend to an urgent phone call.", "The circumstances of the damage were that she opened the piano while the I was out of the room to attend to an urgent phone call. This happened during a lesson, and her action was not intentional but the result of curiosity and ignorance. I May Be Partially responsible here.", "I\u2019m curious how you came to this conclusion. \n\nWhy would they get 5 free lessons?", "WHY?!? The daughter broke something, so she should get lessons for free? How. Does. That. Make. Sense.", "The mother spread negative rumors about OP calling her cruel and heartless for trying to get compensated for the damage the little girl caused to her piano. And that's not even bringing up the backwards logic the Mom has used to not only get out of fixing OP's damaged piano, but get free lessons for her daughter when OP is a professional music teacher.", "You aren't the only piano teacher in the world.   There's loads of people who want to learn piano.  You going to give them all free lessons?", "So this changes the tone of this post entirely. I'm assuming English isn't a first language because otherwise your post was intentionally misleading. \n\n1. For an urgent phone call, you probably should have taken the phone call there and asked her to stop playing. Although this is also kinda unprofessional for taking a call while in lessons. \n2. She opened the piano and did what? Smashed it? This is still so bizarre to me. However, I think at least you should go 50/50 with the neighbor. \n3. You made it sound like the neighbor was saying hey I can't pay you but you can offer me free lessons. That's not what happened. What happened was she was saying I can't afford it, but can we still continue? Very different attitude. \n4. Are you now asking her to pay for lessons on top of the $500? I don't understand why you would suddenly have 2 charges to her. Either charge her the $500 OR charge her for lessons in the future. You can't do both.", "Yeah, worst thing I've done to my piano was a strong snapping. Very scary as the tension it's under is pretty high. But yeah, point being, you wouldn't blame something like that on a child. If she was fooling around and did something like this, that's another story, but if she was playing normally and it broke, that's on OP", "Well I'm assuming there was a typo in there somewhere because not paying the 500 AND getting free lessons for the child makes no sense! I was assuming the mother paid the 500 and in exchange asked for free lessons for her daughter. I think X free classes would have been a nice gesture (sounds better than a discount)", "Yes. For the 4th point, I Was saying that the mother could make up for the piano by paying for the lessons and not paying the 500$ instead of having the lessons for free entirely.   \n\n\nI Should have clarified that after opening the piano, She accidentally spilled water on it while i was gone.\n\nI Definetly take the blame here as I Was being unprofessinal.", "It really doesn\u2019t make any sense but some people are really entitled. \n\nIn another comment OP made, they said the child was getting free lessons before the piano was damaged. \n\nI don\u2019t like to assume but I think what happened is the mother agreed to pay the damage, then couldn\u2019t, and then wanted to continue with the free lessons.", "Ahh, ok, now the story is clear, I would say up to here, NAH. That being said, I think you should see if the mom can split the cost of the piano repairs.", "Ah maybe that's it and I misunderstood. We need some clarifications anyway!", "Op edited the post and clarified if you\u2019re interested in reading it!"]}
