That being said, I can't blame you for not wanting to give the girl piano lessons anymore as she damaged your piano and there's a chance it might happen again in the future. Also, the Mom of the little girl sounds extremely entitled not just for refusing to pay for the damages that her daughter caused, but for asking that you to give up even more money by giving her daughter free lessons when you're a professional music teacher. Imagine the audacity, \"I'm sorry my daughter damaged your piano while playing on it. She obviously damaged it because she doesn't know how to play the piano properly, so maybe if you give her some lessons then she won't damage it in the future. Oh, but I shouldn't have to pay for the lessons because you teaching her how to properly pay is the payment itself.\" No matter how you look at it OP, this woman's reasoning doesn't make even the slightest bit of sense, and I'm glad you didn't cave to her ridiculous demands.", "I\u2019m confused as to how the child did that much damage while you were giving her lessons.  \n\nAs the instructor of any kind of lesson one of the first things you need to teach is \u201cdon\u2019t do this\u201d or \u201conly do it this way\u201d so you know kids won\u2019t damage things or get hurt. \n\nIf you let her loose on a piano and she damaged that much I have to wonder how.", "NTA Any child old enough to take lessons is old enough to know not to touch things that aren't theirs.

And her response to all suggestions instead of at least trying  to compensate you for the damage is to spread rumors about you? No, you are definitely not the AH.", "OP - NTA.   I love that fact you desire to help a passionate child develop her interest.   You've also admitted culpability (at least here) as you left the child to her own devices due to an urgent phone call.  Things happen when you least expect it.\n\nBUT, the mother is out of line and just wants things for free.  First, she said that she'd reimburse you for the damage then later on is trying to barter down to no restitution and free lessons. THEN, she has the audacity to talk about you behind your back - all of which affects your livelihood.   You tried to be creative with solutions and but due to fear of additional attacks, you've been forced to use a throwaway account.  What is to say she wouldn't be doing this if your piano hadn't sustained costly damage?\n\nI feel for the little girl but before you help her - think of this:  you can't support others when you aren't supported yourself..", "Wow, the audacity of that parent to not pay for the damage to your piano AND THEN ask for free lessons on top of that.   \n\nNTA!", "Wait, is this like when you borrow 500 from a person and agree to pay it back by borrowing another 500?

It would be like someone going to a restaurant without any money, and instead of offering to wash the dishes to pay for the meal, they demand that the restaurant pay *them*.

You made it sound like the neighbor was saying hey I can't pay you but you can offer me free lessons. That's not what happened. What happened was she was saying I can't afford it, but can we still continue? Very different attitude. \n4. Are you now asking her to pay for lessons on top of the $500? I don't understand why you would suddenly have 2 charges to her. Either charge her the $500 OR charge her for lessons in the future. You can't do both.", "Yeah, worst thing I've done to my piano was a strong snapping. Very scary as the tension it's under is pretty high. But yeah, point being, you wouldn't blame something like that on a child. If she was fooling around and did something like this, that's another story, but if she was playing normally and it broke, that's on OP", "Well I'm assuming there was a typo in there somewhere because not paying the 500 AND getting free lessons for the child makes no sense! I was assuming the mother paid the 500 and in exchange asked for free lessons for her daughter. I think X free classes would have been a nice gesture (sounds better than a discount)", "Yes. For the 4th point, I Was saying that the mother could make up for the piano by paying for the lessons and not paying the 500$ instead of having the lessons for free entirely.   \n\n\nI Should have clarified that after opening the piano, She accidentally spilled water on it while i was gone.\n\nI Definetly take the blame here as I Was being unprofessinal.", "It really doesn\u2019t make any sense but some people are really entitled. \n\nIn another comment OP made, they said the child was getting free lessons before the piano was damaged. \n\nI don\u2019t like to assume but I think what happened is the mother agreed to pay the damage, then couldn\u2019t, and then wanted to continue with the free lessons.", "Ahh, ok, now the story is clear, I would say up to here, NAH. That being said, I think you should see if the mom can split the cost of the piano repairs.", "Ah maybe that's it and I misunderstood. We need some clarifications anyway!", "Op edited the post and clarified if you\u2019re interested in reading it!", "Is this lady dumb? She can\u2019t afford to pay for the damage her daughter caused, and assumed that you would let said girl continue FREE lessons?\n\nHow did the \u201caccident,\u201d happen anyway? \n\nUgh.

I took piano lessons for 10 years. I was not allowed to have liquid by the piano, and never once did my instructor disrupt my lesson to do something else. You were very unprofessional and honestly I think the cost should be split 50/50.", "I\u2019m a voice teacher and have some thoughts here.  You have a reputation to uphold and you can\u2019t afford to absorb the cost of making repairs when students cause damage. I sincerely hope you have a contract that you require students and parents to sign.  If you don\u2019t, you need to do that.  While it may not have helped in this particular scenario, just establishing the pattern of your setting high and reasonable expectations will be helpful in times of conflict. Also, if you can\u2019t afford a $500 repair, you can\u2019t afford to give away your time and expertise.\n\n1.  Drop the student entirely and tell the parent you are owed $500 for the repair to the piano.  Be willing to accept it in installments and give a receipt for every payment, keeping a duplicate copy for your records.  The kid doesn\u2019t get further lessons unless or until reparation is made.\n\n2.  If you decide to resume lessons after reparation, have the contract in place and require at least a nominal fee.  Too many people don\u2019t appreciate free services; it needs to cost something, even if it\u2019s not what you\u2019re worth.\n\n3. If she refuses to pay, take her to small claims court.  It\u2019s the principle of being held accountable that\u2019s important here.  While in court, show the judge screenshots of the defamatory comments the parent has made and request punitive damages.\n\nNTA, but stop playing so nice.  You need to protect yourself.", "\"Hey, I owe you 500$, but what if instead you just gave ME 200$? That's fair, right?\"", "Yeah, this took me a min to wrap my head around.\n\nI believe she was giving free lessons in the first place and then the accident happened. She wanted reimbursed for the repair and (would) continue the free lessons. Since the mother couldn't pay it back, She thought to charge a little $ for the lessons and continue until it's paid back. Now it seems like she won't get any $ but the mother still wants the free lessons.", "yeah it's really odd. I think he was already providing free lessons to the local kid and mom expected these to continue even though her child damaged the paino.", "Naw, generally, you have to seriously work at it.\n\nSpeaking as somebody who may have deliberately tried to wreck one.\n\nWe owned it, and my actions were the reaction to being forced into learning to play.  Mom never caught on, but the repair guy did,and gave me a quiet word that he knew I did it on purpose, and odds are next time my parents would figure it all out.\n\nTo this day, I won't even admit to people I even know how to play, or did.", "That\u2019s super dumb they\u2019d try to make you feel bad dude. Nah, by denying them, you\u2019ve shut down entitled people and showed you have self respect.", "You aren\u2019t the only person who teaches piano. I would find the biggest gossip and let them know your side of the story, that you don\u2019t blame the kid and that u demand payment for the damage but the mom expects you to give free lessons and not pay for the piano", "In another comment you said she spilled water on it.", "I still had to read through your comments to understand what happened. The damage is on you because you were supervising the child. You definitely shouldn\u2019t be expected to continue giving her free lessons though. Charge her or drop her as a student NAH", "Yes, I should have gone in more detail in this comment, The piano broke in this time because she spilled water on it after opening it.", "NTA. This happened to me a few years ago, and now I don\u2019t let anyone under 14 touch my piano.", "I'm sorry. I have a piano obsession myself and its not a toy. I don't blame you for not offering freebies. That poor kid wouldn't get anywhere near my instruments for at least 10 years. Broke my piano? omgosh. I would be foaming at the mouth inwardly and trying not to scream and howl. That piece of furniture cost me an arm and a leg at the time. \n\nNTA. No way.", "YTA You don\u2019t say how old the child is, but why would you permit water to be in the same room as a child and your piano? The child and the piano were both under your care. \n\nMy father was a musician; liquids were never allowed anywhere near musical instruments in our household.", "Wait.\n\nSo the kid damaged the piano and instead of paying for it, she asked for free lessons?\n\nHow greedy is that mom?\n\nYou are a better person than me cos I would have told everyone and their dog what that woman is doing.\n\nNTA.", "Why would you allow water near the piano?? Your fault.", "She's 7. She had liquid in the room *you* knew about? You left her alone when you were supposed to be directly supervising her with the liquid that you knew was there? I'm going with you need to think about how you structure your lessons better and that it's a 50/50 expense. \n\nI've had kids take music lessons and never once was a drink allowed near the instruments during lesson time. Every teacher was very strict about that even in my home using my piano they didn't allow drinks because accidents happen and accidents are expensive to fix so get into habits from the outset", "NTA.  You needed $500 to have the piano fixed (which absolutely had to be done in order for the lessons to continue to their full potential), and the backtracking alternative option that the girl's mother made was one that would not have assisted with paying that cost.  In addition, anyone who spreads nasty rumors about another person is always in the wrong.\n\nYou mentioned suggesting a payment plan that the mother rejected.  Did that include, by any chance, her paying a fraction of the cost and you paying the rest of it, like half-and-half?  If that was what you meant, then that makes the situation even worse and further reinforces my NTA ruling, given that it's the next best solution to one party paying the $500.  If not, maybe you could posit this idea?", "I think she means she can\u2019t pay for both the piano and lessons so she will pay for the piano if she gives her daughter free lessons but idk", "I thought it was just me that didn\u2019t understand the mother\u2019s reasoning. Nope, it just makes no sense.\n\nNTA", "Unless Op is afflicted with Good Samaritan Syndrome, I just don't get how freebies are an answer to this problem? Keep your kid in your house and away from my piano and I'm good neighbor lady.", "*I WILL GLADLY PAY YOU TUESDAY FOR A HAMBURGER TODAY?*", "No, the girl would be ruining her own motivation if she ruined someone else\u2019s property and then saw that as enough of a hurdle to give up her dreams.
