You're probably just \"the weird uncle who doesn't *need* all that money.

I feel like the entitlement would still be there, but if they wanted to ask for help for wedding expenses (tacky) they should have had a number in mind or asked you how much you can contribute to help with budget. $1000 is very generous given your relation, related or not, but it seems like they wanted your contribution to be a significant percentage of the cost. $1000 is helpful but they clearly were thinking bigger financial contribution.
