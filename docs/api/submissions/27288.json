You're probably just \"the weird uncle who doesn't *need* all that money.

I feel like the entitlement would still be there, but if they wanted to ask for help for wedding expenses (tacky) they should have had a number in mind or asked you how much you can contribute to help with budget. $1000 is very generous given your relation, related or not, but it seems like they wanted your contribution to be a significant percentage of the cost. $1000 is helpful but they clearly were thinking bigger financial contribution.

Chances are the $15K would have grown later when the bride or family discovered something they couldn't live without (chocolate fountain at the reception? doves to release after the ceremony? diamond encrusted pumpkin chariot to carry the entitled bride and family to the ceremony?)", "Sounds like they are spending too much. My SIL just got married and it was very fun for less than $10k. 100% NTA the rest of the family are all AH", "NTA 1K would have paid for my whole wedding and I would have been thrilled with any gift I got. For me it\u2019s not about gifts, it\u2019s about celebrating the love. I guess that\u2019s why we are still together 23 years later.", "Nta", "NTA. It's not even clear to me why you'd be helping to pay for the wedding in the first place.", "INFO: Have you spoken with the niece at all through any of this, or are you just dealing with bro and sil? If just them, maybe they promised niece money and are trying to pass your donation off as theirs!", "NTA. It doesn't even look like you have a relationship with the bride so you weren't invited. Just your wallet. At least they revealed their colours at the early stage.", "NTA. I would say that your SIL kind of rejected your offer when she started calling you names for offering \"only\" $1000.  \nTheir loss.", "15k a big chunk of cake to just randomly ask for. That's probably most of the cost of the wedding. \nIf the bride called you and said that she was sorry that her parents were money grubbing jackwagons, I'd probably return to the original plan.    \nNTA", "NTA... I dont understand the entitlement of some family. Especially when one member makes sacrifices and saves - their efforts are not public property", "They are greedy. NTA.", "NTA \n\nDid your brother not receive an inheritance he could've use for the wedding?", "It\u2019s just a wedding but whatever is important to u", "NTA. I guess they need to change their wedding to suit their budget.", "NTA no way. Tell him you\u2019ll contribute to the next wedding.", "NTA their assumption is that as you don\u2019t have a wife or children, that the brother is going to inherit your estate, so why not just give it to them early? They are assuming your money.\n\nI\u2019d send a nice toaster from Target (get the bright red one) and call it a day.", "NTA, jeez man I feel for you", "NTA.\n\nThey don't get to shit on your tongue then DEMAND that you sing for them.", "NTA. 1k is incredibly generous, especially given the relationship you have with her. Especially since you were planning to give an additional grand. They have no right to your money and were acting incredibly entitled", "NTA these people are so stupid!!! $1k is good, in fact, any money is good. Glad you shut them all up!", "I would have been thrilled with $100, let alone $1000. NTA", "NTA. \n\nLet\u2019s set aside the \u201cstep\u201d part for a moment. Even if she were your brother\u2019s bio child, you are under no obligation to help with the wedding. She\u2019s not your daughter.\n\nThe way your SIL is treating you is unacceptable, and your brother doesn\u2019t seem to be helping the situation. Sure, he apologized. Then, rather then asking what you were willing/able to contribute, he asked for another outrageous sum of money.\n\nYou have every right to refuse to financially contribute to the wedding. Call your sibling and say, \u201cI\u2019m not a bank. I\u2019m your brother. My offer was more than generous, and you and your wife tried to take advantage of me. That\u2019s wrong and hurtful, and I am no longer willing to contribute to wedding costs.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m sorry this happened to you. It\u2019s hard to mix money and family/friends. If you continue to have a generous heart in the future, I\u2019d suggest being clear about your limits upfront. It can feel weird, but at least your boundaries are clear.", "I love how he called you to apologize and instead of asking for you to come to the wedding, he immediately asked you for money.", ">I initially told them I would help, I was thinking maybe $1,000 or so. \n\nNo one really thinks helping with wedding costs is $1k. \n\nI mean they are horribly entitled but you really should have NOT said you would help if you intended such a small amount. I'm not saying it's not a generous gift, but it's absolutely a different thing that helping with total wedding costs. Everyone is to blame on not clarifying that.\n\nNTA technically bc they are entitled but really it's closer to ESH overall...", "NTA.\nGood decision to not give anything because your brother called to apologize then didn't even try to say please just attend. He didn't say your 1k was more then generous and we'd be happy to accept if you're willing. \nNo he was like how about 5k like a gift is a negotiation?!?", "NTA.", "The fact that they even had the audacity to beg for money *while apologizing* is baffling. A lack of shame doesn\u2019t even begin to describe their actions. They don\u2019t deserve a cent.", "It\u2019s incredible the entitlement of people. They see a family member better off and feel they are entitled to his money (maybe because he has no kids)!  Incredible and sad as they don\u2019t really care for family relations. \n\nOP NTA", "I personally would donate $5,000 to charity in their name. Then they\u2019ll get a nice thank you note. Win-win situation. NTA", "Weddings have gotten unbelievably expensive in the past few years due to inflation and demand. $15k could easily be less than a quarter of the bill, even at a modest large wedding. That said, yes, NTA, and SIL is a huge AH.", "[removed]", "Yes, and they can always have a smaller wedding.", "I mean, calling someone names for not giving them 15x his original offer would be an automatic dealbreaker in my book too.", "> They don't respect you. \n\nExactly.  They think that OP is a weakling that they can bully out of fifteen grand.", "I\u2019m confused.  He offered $1,000 and that wasn\u2019t enough.  I thought when the brother apologized he asked for $5,000.  But ppl are saying $15k???", "Definitely agree with this. I also agree NTA, but this whole situation could have been handled better.", "I don't know - to me 1000 bucks is generous. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f  Who just gives away 1000 bucks?", "Thank you for your perspective.", "I am not sure why this comment is downvoted. I also thought is would be more than 1k to \u201chelp\u201d with wedding costs. But maybe I am more aware of the cost of weddings.\n\nOP you are NTA in refusing to pay 15k.  I think this could have been avoided if you and SIL had a fuller conversation at the time she asked, for that you are both at fault. Asking doesn\u2019t make anyone an AH, it the verbal abuse that puts SIL and your brother in the AH line.", "I have met my niece once, I don't know her at all.  My brother and I would have worked this out without his wife, who I fully admit to disliking.  Maybe I will give it to her after, that is a good idea..", "The same thought crossed my mind. Are they even going to use the money on the wedding?", "First and foremost if you cannot afford to have a lavish wedding then don\u2019t have one. \n\nIf you have to ask for handouts to pay for your kids wedding then scale down. \n\nYou get married because you love your partner and want to do life with your person a wedding is just the icing on the cake. \n\nWhat you not get to do is ask for money and then demand more. \n\nNope. Full stop. NO! OP NTA!", "You are so much nicer than I am. I would spend that $5000 on something completely frivolous or a nice vacation and post pictures of it daily.

NTA. AT ALL. I\u2019d reach out to your brother\u2019s step-daughter and tell her that you offered $1000 but her mother demanded $15k, since you are not an ATM, you\u2019re declining to be involved at all. But if you feel you still want to gift her the $1,000, that\u2019s absolutely your prerogative", "Don\u2019t give anything please. Why would you? You got berated and called names. No, they is not a way to go about things, and then receive a gift. If you give anything then you become a sucker and a joke.", "Exactly.   It\u2019s all about one upping their friends.  It\u2019s all about aesthetic and show than actual celebration."]}
