They're INCURABLE. But it doesn't mean they can't be managed, it's difficult work but work that needed to be done.\n\n\nYou're justified to be angry because not only were they dismissive of a potential lifelong issue and it's 2023, no decent person makes period 'jokes' anymore unless they're just being dismissive of someone. I wouldn't say you 'overreacted' because A) you can't control your mood swings rn and B) your dad's habit to get under someone's skin is not even a good 'joke' even more so for that misogynistic comment just to dismiss his daughter's health issue. \n\nI highly doubt your parents will be of any help and will just probably dismiss it as \"all in your head\" or \"you are the problem\"  until you can move out and pay on your own to get help. \n\nI don't understand how is it a 'joke' to wind up someone who is just trying to go about their day?

It takes a lot to not get physical after my brother and dad bother me with touching and/or stupid questions.\n\nMy brother with his touching (poking and ear touching) and my dad with \u201cwhat are you studying?\u201d.\n\nI hate being touched and I hate that my dad keeps asking me what I\u2019m studying even though I\u2019ve already told him I\u2019m not going to college (for now).\n\nIf you asked me if it\u2019s \u201cthat time of the month\u201d, I\u2019d snap and lose it too, since I can\u2019t have periods and it\u2019s an insensitive thing to say. If a woman is mad, she must be on her period, right? It can\u2019t be for any other reason than her bleeding a river of blood every month.\n\nPresuming that female reproductive organs make women behave irrationally is rude and sexist, so yes it *is* sexist and misogynistic.\n\nSwearing at your parents isn\u2019t okay but intentionally trying to rile up your child who isn\u2019t in a good mood is not the way to go about it.\n\nIf OP has these mood swings and they\u2019re getting more frequent and extreme, there\u2019s probably an underlying issue- mentally-wise.\n\nI would have gone for E S H but considering that OP\u2019s dad was intentionally winding her up and chalking it up as her being on her period, NTA.\n\nEDIT: Sucks that you tried to insult my intelligence and my hobbies in the chat you invited me to because no one agreed with your sexist and misogynistic mindset and comment.\n\nI thought you were an adult that knew better. Why did you delete your comment? Because of what you wrote and the inevitable fear of other woman backing me up and not you?", "My mum doesn\u2019t always back him up, but it\u2019s difficult for her because if she backs me up my dad gets angry and refuses to properly apologise, he\u2019ll just ignore us and go off elsewhere", "I agree, AND when a father or older male authority figure uses this sort of immature tactic against a youngster, it\u2019s extremely pathetic.", "I'm afraid you are on the wrong reddit.", "Same here.  No periods for me.", "They tend to get big feelings when you point out that anger is, in fact, an emotion. Therefore when you react in anger, you are reacting - get this - emotionally.\n\nIt's a statement of barest fact, but you might as well be insinuating that their pp is widdle bitty.", "It is also worth noting that something like 75% of women with ADHD also have symptoms of PMDD. Before I got on the pill, I just thought extreme rage and suicidal ideation every month was just part of womanhood.\n\nStill, men should absolutely not assume that a woman's emotions are due to their period. NTA, OP.", "It is absolutely sexist and demeaning.", "*All the women you -think- you\u2019re close with.", "So what you\u2019re saying is you\u2019re just another illiterate male who couldn\u2019t get the point even if it was handed to him.", "Info: how old are you?\n\nI think talking to a therapist might help process those emotions without verbally attacking the people you care about that are not the problem.", "No, it is not okay even with a mood disorder when 'getting pissy' causes somebody to lash out at others. If you have a mood disorder, it is your responsibility to work on yourself and seek treatment, you don't get a free pass to lash out at people. \nIt's a very difficult task, kudos to everybody with a mood disorder that actively fights it. But it does not make mistreating people okay \n\nIn this exact instance, I think OP is valid and personally would vote NTA though I think ESH is also a fair vote, I just was bothered by the implications in your first sentence", "It's not okay, they need to seek treatment. Don't dismiss shitty behavior.", "I called him an asshole, didn't I?\n\nA better way to phrase it was that the dad's behavior should have been expected, to a degree. I'm not excusing it.", "That is not appropriate emotional maturity a grown man should have, I\u2019m glad you recognized that and stood up for yourself. \n\nWe obviously don\u2019t know your full family dynamic, so I understand why she may have to play nice, but she should stand up for her child.", "\ud83d\ude02 \n\nI had The visit from auntie Flo every 28 days for37 years ( except not when pregnant) \nI don\u2019t miss her at all  \n\n\ud83e\ude78", "Yep, I have ADHD and PMDD, it sucks and it's awful, but my experience in my feelings are still valid and no one should dismiss anyone just because they want to be a misogynist about it. I find that for some reason, I reddit loves to dismiss what women experience when they are postpartum or PMSing, but anything motivated or affected by testosterone is real and cool.", "Ye men youre right, my wife and me are not close at all. You got me", "I\u2019m 15, which is why I thought these mood swings were normal, like a part of puberty? I don\u2019t know how much this helps but I do have Emetophobia, which is classed as an anxiety disorder, which I also thought possibly contributed to mood swings or there was something more behind the anxiety and phobia", "He was intentionally trying to wind her up while knowing she was already in a bad mood. Well he got what he was asking for and then some ESH her dad is an asshole for not just leaving her alone she was having a conversation with her mother not him and he came along to annoy her on purpose. She needs to get her mood in check, she could have a number of issues from undiagnosed mental illness to a thyroid disorder and leaving it unchecked knowing its a problem is an asshole move. I guess her mom doesnt suck but maybe she does cz the dad felt comfortable enough to say that bs so he prob says bs all the time \u201cas a joke\u201d and she just deals with it.", "Ah yes, a minor in a misogynistic household where parental support involves \u201cwinding her up\u201d (kicking her when she is down) and making excuses for said behavior likely has plenty of resources and support to seek therapy for a mood disorder she can easily identify because she has good role models for measured emotional behavior around her.\n\n\nNTA. She\u2019s a teenager dealing with hormones, growing pains, college stress, and the social pressure cooker of high school with a pig of a father and an enabling mother. I feel like having a couple of rough days a month is pretty normal in a situation like that, and even if it isn\u2019t, it\u2019s on her parents to help her when potential medical issues arise including any potential mood disorders.", "At some point in your life, your wife and every other woman you know, has had to apologize to another woman for something you\u2019ve said. \n\nThey\u2019ll likely never admit to this because you\u2019re too obtuse to care.", "Yes mood swings are a part of puberty, but it isn\u2019t excuse to yell at people who have no idea what is going on in your head. Talk to a therapist, learn some calming techniques, get medication for your anxiety if it\u2019s that bad.", "Question did ever get texted for neurodiversity?\nCan you talk to a school counselor about what\u2019s going on?", "Yes, I agree", "Its even worse now that I know she\u2019s only 15 so add in teenage girl hormones to the untreated anxiety she has because her mother refuses to let her take meds or help her find a therapist I change my vote from ESH to NTA her parents are failing her she needs some damn support!", ">At some point in your life, your wife and every other woman you know, has had to apologize to another woman for something you\u2019ve said.\n\nYou know, what I love the most about you redditors is the fact that you always talk with confidence. I mean 90% of the time you literally have no idea what you are talking about, but you sound so confident when you say it that some people might actually believe you.\n\nAlthough I have to say that I actually was once told by a coworker that I was sexist for the following situation.\n\nShe was a 22-23 year fresh college graduate that worked in my company for around 6months. And all the time she kept complaining about the salary, she kept saying \"this and that guy are making more than me, its so sexist and misogynistic\" and i told her that is has nothing to do with her gender, the guys that she is talking about have been in the company for 2+ years and she has only been at the company for 6 months.\n\nAnd that is literally the only time Ive ever been called sexist by anyone.\n\n>They\u2019ll likely never admit to this because you\u2019re too obtuse to care.\n\nI would pay a lot of money to meet the people that have the mental strenth to be around you.", "I wish I could go to therapy and get medication but my mum is strictly against letting me use anxiety medication, and she isn\u2019t really helping me find a therapist, so I\u2019m kinda on my own. I understand my mood swings are no excuse to shout at others, and I don\u2019t always shout, I usually go to my bedroom and isolate myself to calm myself down, but that time he just got to me, and I couldn\u2019t stay quiet", "*The only time you -know- that you\u2019ve been called sexist by anyone.", ".. dude it\u2019s hard when your parents suck at being mature adults. Keep working on the self growth especially around mental health, it\u2019s not the presence of disorder, rather a continuum and how we interact with life emotionally, socially etc.. can always ask your Rents to let you have your doctors number and talk to the about being set up with an adult who can be the middleman with your authoritative parents.. Best of luck!", "Is she against all medications? Does she think any anxiety medicine would be a benzo? Would she be against an antidepressant? (not saying you are depressed).

You've been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder.  The fact that you have these mood swings, and get frustrated & angry to the point that you are blowing up means you should get some help.  At this point it's affecting the whole family - therapy is talking out what is already going on in your head, and addressing it truthfully.  Let her know you want to learn ways to defuse your anger and better manage your anxiety - you don't want it affecting your home life or your schooling.  \n\nTry talking to a counselor at school, they may be able to help you get some help.  Yes growing up is difficult but it shouldn't be THAT difficult, you shouldn't have to navigate all those difficult ups&downs alone. \n\nThere may be some online support groups for teens & anxiety that could help too", "Christ almighty what the hell am I doing, Im trying to have a conversation with a child lmao.
