I\u2019m fine with this. I have experience with severe allergies, including my own shellfish allergy. I really enjoy gathering around food so I often cook and invite my classmates over to eat and have dinner. When I started doing this I asked for a list of her allergies so I could work around them. She provided me with a list of 5 allergens. So I cooked food working around these allergens. \n\nWhen she got to my house she took one look at the food I made and told me she was allergic to something in it. I offered to cook her something else but she told me she was so allergic that she couldn\u2019t be around it. So I put it away and made everyone a different meal. I chocked it up to an accident and wasn\u2019t too bent out of shape about it.\n\nThe next time I confirmed her allergies with her but when she showed up the same thing happened and we couldn\u2019t eat one of the dishes I prepared because of an allergen that hadn\u2019t been on the list I confirmed. This time I was pretty annoyed. Yesterday I was going to cook again and confirmed her allergies and she showed up and told me yet again that she couldn\u2019t eat what I made. She seemed annoyed as if I was not willing to accommodate her allergies. \n\nThis time I said to her that it wasn\u2019t on her list of allergens and that I was kind of annoyed that she hadn\u2019t given me the full list especially when her allergies are so severe that no one can eat these foods around her and that next time I am happy to accommodate her food allergies if she provides me a complete list. \n\nThe thing is now that it has been 3 separate times I am very annoyed. I don\u2019t particularly enjoy hanging out with her but my class is small and I would feel bad not inviting her especially surrounding allergies. My birthday is coming up and I just want to enjoy my favorite meal with friends. It doesn\u2019t have any of the allergens she has given me to date but I am not really willing to shift plans if she shows up and can\u2019t eat my food. \n\nWIBTA if I texted her ahead of time telling her what I was making and saying I hope she can make it but if if it doesn\u2019t fit her dietary needs I look forward to hanging out in the future? I am trying to be reasonable and accommodating so I would appreciate any advice.", "created_utc": 1667263293, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yitzz8/wibta_if_i_didnt_accommodate_my_classmates_food/", "score": 107, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If she shows up and says she is allergic to it calmly reiterate everything in front of your guests. \n\nI\u2019m only saying all this because it seems almost deliberate (either intentionally leaving allergies out or making allergies up) and she might be looking for a reason to cause a problem with you.", "YWNBTA\n\nYou have been more accommodating than that I would have.

Normally I bring my own food to make sure I have something to eat because I'M AN ADULT.\n\nYou two barely know each other, the fact that she expects to be catered to (pun intended) in such a manner, smacks of entitlement, especially when she then decides after the fact that whatever you made isn't sufficient.\n\nOP, you're a saint for trying to cook for someone who constantly moves the goalposts. It sounds like she's doing this deliberately. If you choose not to invite her in the future, it's not because she has food allergies, it's because she's making everything all about her. I seriously doubt she even has the issues she's claiming, as this happens repeatedly and she says she can't even be in the same room as the food you went out of your way to cook for her that she initially said would work?!\n\nI'd text her something like, \"Here's what I'm making; if this doesn't work for you, feel free to bring your own dishes in order to ensure you have something to eat. Please know I will also no longer be able to put away food that you're severely allergic to, and you will need to leave as I wouldn't want you to be harmed.\"\n\nActually, because I'm me, I would be super tired of her crap and I wouldn't even invite her.\n\nETA: YWNBTA", "NTA, others people issues and problems and poor choices and whatever else, including food allergies, are not your responsibility.

Believe me...it's not something you forget. \nSo if you want to try again...I would plan the menu and just tell her what you are making...if she can eat it~great! If not...oh well.

She's playing some sort of stupid power-trippy, mind game and you're who within the boundaries of etiquette dealing with it, you have a set menu and you leave no room for argument, it's her choice to attend or not.", "YWNBTA.  This sounds like some game playing to me.  Stop inviting her.  Does she do this to other people, too?

I don't see why OP should reward her bad behavior by giving her the power to control the menu for OP's birthday dinner. At most, I'd say that OP should invite her, but make it clear to her that OP will accommodate the allergies of which she has been made aware *ahead of time*; any new allergies announced on the day will be ignored, and the girl can either decline to partake in that dish, or leave.", "Agreed! I have a tomato allergy, as well as not being able to eat spicy foods due to IBS. I told my friend that when they invited me to their party and they ordered tacos that were both spicy and had tomato, when they asked why I wasn't eating I said why and then grabbed food I had In my bag so it was all good.\n\nI just expect as someone with foods I have to avoid that if I tell them and they forget I always have backup for myself. It's hard to remember all that, but I do get a bit peeved if they are upset I won't eat it even if they remove the tomato. It doesn't work like that. You'd be surprised how many people get mad when I say I can't eat what they brought and have my own food.\n\nIt's kind of crazy. I'm not trying to disrespect then, I just literally can't eat it. I always keep notes of friends allergies or sensitivities in my contact list because I understand how tough it is to not be able to eat with everyone, but also understand many who don't have these issues don't remember.

You\u2019ve tried everything. At this point I would do the same thing as always, make dinner accommodating for her \u201callergy\u2019s\u201d make sure to write down the list and when everyone is sitting down make a big deal about it. Make her sit down and write on a piece of paper what all of her allergy\u2019s are and make sure everyone in the room knows.

While you\u2019d like to invite her, you don\u2019t want to risk her life, so it\u2019s better that she not come so she\u2019s safe and as you are too stressed to cook for her. \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nFirstly, I have MANY anaphylactic food allergies and I maybe I can help.    One of the things you can do is make things that she is not allergic to but also offer that she can bring her own dish if she wants to join in.   If you stick to her list and do not cook any of the foods that she is extremely allergic to and if you are welcoming her to bring her own meal that shouldn't be a problem.    If I am invited to a gathering and someone is cooking something that I cannot breathe in (some anaphylactics cannot be in the same room as the items being cooked or eaten) I will make an appearance and try to stay by the window or an open door and then excuse myself (take my inhaler and antihistamine in the washroom) then politely leave shortly thereafter.   I've had to resort to having a friend call me in X number of minutes and I've mentioned that I would love to stay but an emergency has come up and I must leave.   \n\nSecondly, it is important to point out that for a person with multiple food anaphylaxis, it is like walking through a minefield or having a gun pointed in your face.   Even trying to eat may cause extremely crippling anxiety as cross-contamination of other people's food happens fairly regularly and it really really sucks going into shock and ending up in the hospital from a single bite of food.   It could simply be her anxiety that has taken over that she won't eat.   One becomes a social outcast because you've ruined everyone's night.   The likelihood is she is not doing this on purpose, but she is interpreting it like playing Russian roulette and may not have control over her anxiety.  You can even arrange a safe word beforehand with her so that if she is feeling too anxious or needs to leave early you can know secretly that she is not trying to be rude.   And please DO NOT tell the others about the safe word etc. if you chose to go this route.  \n\nPeople with food anaphylaxis have a small social circle because the vast amount of socialization occurs over food and drink - after a while, people just stop inviting you because you can't enjoy their special dish or drink or what have you.", "NTA. And you are better than me because after three times I wouldn't invite her again.", "NTA ok but just hear me out. If she is severely allergic to several ingredients that she can not even be around them, is it really plausible that she forgot an item not once not twice but three times? Also cross contamination exists, if you did not sanitize everything religiously before making something else on the spot she would have been exposed imo.", "YWNBTA as long as you politely point out that she has failed to give you a complete list three times.", "NTA, just tell her to bring her own food. That's what most people do when they are intensely allergic to a lot of common food items that are necessary to dishes.", "NTA  \nPlease continue to invite but say that you have realised that you simply don't have the ability  to cook a safe meal for her.  Ask her to bring her own food so that you will know she is safe.   \n\n\nIf you really, really want to host her and cook for her, then flip it around and request that she provide a recipe or a list of ingredients  that she knows is safe.   \n\n\nIf you do that, then shine a light on it so all the other guests understand what is happening . Send out the invite to everyone and include a description of the recipe (with a full list of ingredients). Say something like \"I look forward to seeing everyone at 7pm this Saturday.  Allergic Annie has kindly shared a special recipe that she has confirmed is completely safe for her to eat so you can all look forward to haveing some Stewed Prunes with Almonds (link to recipe and ingredients) as well as some other delicious food\"    \n\n\nThen if she shows up and can't eat it, don't scramble and cook anything new. Just say that's really too bad. Everyone else will understand that you have tried your hardest.   \n\n\nThen get her to bring her own food.  (But honestly you can skip directly to that. Someone with that many (supposed) allergies should not be eating food out of their control anyhow.", "Yeap. Totally agree. I\u2019m calling bullshit on these allergies."]}
