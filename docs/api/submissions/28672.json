Also, different jurisdictions may have different laws around these practices.\n\nWith that in mind, it may be company policy to require a doctor's note for time off requested under the \"sick day\" label as a way to prevent workers from taking time off for \"no reason.\" If she's only asking as part of her official role to satisfy company policy, then she's not really the AH, the workplace is.", "This.

It\u2019s an incredibly difficult and stressful job that just keeps getting more difficult and stressful with very little payout. Teachers call out ALL THE TIME just because they need a day. I\u2019m sure she did suspect it, but it\u2019s his time to take however he wants. If anything, he\u2019s doing them a favor by putting it in in advance. We had a teacher call out at 7:30 the other day (for reference, school starts at 7:20). \n\nNTA. The school will survive without you for a day, OP, and she will get over it.

A new teacher comes in and says \u201chey, I\u2019m going to need a sub next week since I\u2019ll be taking a sick day\u201d. Office lady mentions it is weird to plan a sick day in advanced. Teacher says it is personal. Since he is asking to use sick time and not PTO, office lady pushes back. Teacher says it\u2019s for an appointment. Office lady tries to be helpful to the young teacher, says that, if it\u2019s just a doctor\u2019s appointment, then he can take a half day and not need to use up the sick time. Teacher says it\u2019s fine, just gonna take the sick day. Office lady pushes back a bit more since the whole thing seems a bit sketchy. That\u2019s when OP says he is getting circumcised again, which is pretty blunt and a bit weird since it\u2019s not usually something you do multiple times so conversation is over.", "\ud83c\udfb5*And I would walk 500 mohels...*", "The office lady had absolutely NO business needing to know why the teacher needed off.\n\nEdit: I've worked in HR & payroll for more than 2 decades.
