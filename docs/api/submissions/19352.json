{"id": 19352, "submission_id": "144v8hh", "title": "AITA for making my friend leave a cafe alone?", "selftext": "My older sister Lena (29F) and I (23X) have been slowly reconnecting. We'd been NC since 2019, but after a health scare she wrote me a long, honest letter and said she wanted me back in her life. At first, I wasn't interested in having a relationship with her, but after speaking with her on the phone once a week for the past 2 months, I finally worked up the courage to invite her to lunch at a cafe we both loved when we were kids. I was planning on bringing my SO with me as moral support, but he caught a bug and was down for the count. So 3 days before the scheduled lunch I asked one of my best friends Mia (24F) if she felt comfortable coming with me instead. She agreed immediately, so I kept the plan in place.\n\nIt was going really well at first. I was worried that we wouldn't find things to talk about or that Mia would feel out of place, but conversation was flowing and Lena and I both got teary at one point. The energy shifted, though, when a couple with a toddler took the table next to us. Mia doesn't like kids. I work in education, and she hates hearing about my job because she thinks kids are boring, gross, and finds crying overstimulating (honestly, as a neurodivergent educator, I sometimes agree with the last two!) If I bring up my work, I usually get a lecture about how she can't believe I'd voluntarily spend time with children. I get where she's coming from based on her childhood, so I don't let this affect our relationship, and if I don't mention my students or my young cousins around her, it rarely comes up.\n\nThis toddler was acting like a toddler. He wasn't crying or screaming, but it was a small cafe and he was asking his dad a lot of questions and when the waiter came to take the family's order, the process was probably longer than it could have been. His mom also accidentally hit Mia with her elbow when she went to grab him a toy, though she did apologize. Once they were settled in, I hardly noticed them. But Mia was visibly upset. She turned to me and said she wouldn't have come if she'd known there would be kids and that I should've chosen an adult-only restaurant. I told Mia that she'd known where we were going days ago and she hadn't raised a concern then and then reminded her that I'd chosen this cafe for a specific reason. She replied that she shouldn't have to remind me to respect her boundaries and that a good friend would have known that it was unacceptable. She said she was leaving and that I should come with her. I declined, but said she was free to go.\n\nBefore leaving on her own, Mia turned to Lena and said she \"didn't agree, but understood\" why she'd treated me the way she did. Lena and I barely spoke for the rest of the meal and I was absolutely mortified. I hadn't reached out to Mia since I didn't think I had anything productive to say to her yet, but today I got a text from her demanding to know why I haven't reached out to apologize for \"making her leave the cafe alone.\"\n\nEdit: spacing", "created_utc": 1686285125, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/144v8hh/aita_for_making_my_friend_leave_a_cafe_alone/", "score": 55, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Mia is the AH here imo. you can't control other people and she knew where yall were going so she could've chosen for herself and her boundaries instead of putting that on you. then the last comment about you and Lena's relationship/ issues/ whatever was completely out of line. Mia had no right commenting on that and SHE should be the one apologizing imo", "NTA - Please surround yourself with more compassionate and supportive people. She knew how big of a deal this was for you and made a scene and then an unnecessary comment that she likely knew would have made both you and your sister uncomfortable.\n\nMia sounds like a bit of a red flag. I promise you have more value than to settle for friends who are so wrapped up in their own opinion on children to even let you speak about your work. I don\u2019t think you need to say anything to her but if you do, I\u2019d urge to tell her that she disappointed you. You were counting on her for support and she failed you big time.\n\nI hope that everything goes well with your sister.", "NTA, talk about a narcissist my god. A 24yo woman should be able to handle a toddler being nearby, not even crying and screaming, especially during such an important occasion for a friend", "A cafe that allows children\u2026oh the horror.", "NTA, but Mia sure is for a lot of reasons. She made you reconnecting with your sister entirely about her on the basis she doesn't like children (her extreme disgust is actually pretty messed up), and even made a gross comment as she left that she knew would sabotage the rest of your time together. \n\nGiven she also blatantly disrespects your career to the point you have to pretend it doesn't exist... It doesn't really sound like she's a good friend outside of this encounter either.", "NTA. Your friend is being a bit unreasonable. She knew where you were going and she knew why. This wasn't about her. At all. And now it seems as though everything is.", "NTA.\n\nYou clearly mentioned the name of the cafe to your friend beforehand. It was completely her choice that she agreed to accompany you, as she was under no compulsion to do so. I think she overreacted, almost as if she is allergic to children!", "NTA  She is extremely self centered.", "NTA  Mia had no right or reason to expect you to leave with her.  Just because she doesn't like kids was no reason for her to be so rude.", "NTA.  Mia is completely unreasonable.", "NTA and hating kids to the point of having issues with them merely existing in a public space is not normal imo. Don\u2019t apologize and rethink that friendship since she had no problem going for a low blow (telling sister that she understood why she treated you that way).", "Nta. Kids are people. And tbey have every right to be there as she does. If she wanted a kid free soace should have gone to a bar\n\nEdit: I also work in child care and am neurodivergent.", "NTA \n\nI fucking hate children but I\u2019d never go that low. She should have just nutted up and taken it. The last comment was particularly classless from her, I\u2019d think about wether you want to be friends with her", "NTA- you didn't make your friend do anything. It might have been worth postponing the meet up until your spouse could come as asking a friend to be a buffer is quite a big ask. \n\nI am low to NC with my parents and so I understand the need to feel safe. Meeting in public is definitely a good idea and having moral support is also a good idea. \n\nIt sounds like your friends difficulties with children are a bit more intense than simply not liking them. As a child free adult I understand that when I go to a cafe there is a chance of pre-school children being in attendance during the day. You can't possibly be held responsible.\n\nI'd come at this from a place of gratitude that she came to support you. I'd potentially empathize with the fact that she found being accidentally knocked on the elbow distressing. I'd even support her decision to leave if she found it all too difficult. But seeing as you are both adults, you did not need to leave with her.", "NTA\u2014children make me super uncomfortable too, like to an extent that is very hard to explain to most people, but in every situation where I\u2019m around a kid, I\u2019m the adult and it is my job to take care of myself and my own sensory needs. There\u2019s no way a child can accommodate me, but a thousand ways I can accommodate myself. Children exist in public places\u2014it\u2019s unreasonable to expect a child-free zone in a public cafe. And anyway, that\u2019s just one of the many ways she\u2019s TA, I don\u2019t even have time to unpack how she derailed a very important and emotional meeting for you\u2026", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Mia in completely 100% t.a. and should apologize to both you AND your sister for her behavior and her comment.  She knew where the place and why you chose it.", "Holy shit, she is whacked out of her mind. NTA", "NTA. You didn't invite the toddler! What even is an \"adult-only restaurant?\" Do we just not have those in my area? Because I have never heard of a restaurant that bans children. There are restaurants where I would be a little surprised to see a toddler, but I can't think of a single one I could confidently say there will be no kids there, especially at lunch.", "It seems more like Mia's real problem was not being the center of attention and she threw a temper tantrum over it. In an extremely inappropriate situation..", "I would not have asked just any friend. Mia and I have known each other since elementary school, and she's had a front row seat to everything between me and my sister. I called her in a half a panic when my partner got sick and it was only after she assured me multiple times that it was okay with her that I asked.\n\nI think you're right about approaching with empathy and gratitude. I wish I was in a place right now where that was my knee jerk reaction, but given that Mia does know everything that went down with my sister, the fact that her parting words were referring to how I might have deserved how I was treated is really smarting right now. I'll try to circle back to unpack everything with her once I can do that without centering my own anger.\n\nI am so sorry to hear about your parents. I hope you have a support network that helps you feel empowered, safe, and seen.", "Mia is not a friend.  If she can\u2019t get past an issue such as a normal inquisitive child at the next table in a place that allows kids, she shouldn\u2019t go out in public.  I can\u2019t stand unruly children or bad parents when I am dining out, but what you describe is none of that.  Mia is definitely someone I would not go places with, ever. You can\u2019t even mention a cousin?!", "It sounds like she needs some time to calm down and potentially see this from more than just her own perspective.\n\nIt's understandable that it wasn't your first reaction. You were already in a heightened emotional state from spending time with your sister. \n\nI do have a wonderful support system in place and have had a fair bit of therapy. It's their loss, not mine.", "What she said was so hurtful..I\u2019m sorry. \n\nMaybe send Mia a quick message letter her know that her comment was very hurtful and you\u2019re taking the time to re-evaluate the friendship. You\u2019ll be in touch when you\u2019re ready to chat. \n\nI personally would block her for a couple of days so you don\u2019t get any phone calls or texts."]}
