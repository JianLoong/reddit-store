Keep your frigging hands away from stuff that isn't yours.", "NTA. If he takes food off the wrong persons plate he's going to get poked with fork. And it's pretty good rule of thumb to not do something to a child you wouldn't do to a grownup. Your brother is absolutely an ahole for stealing a kids food and then saying they have bad manners for speaking up about it.", "NTA. You are teaching your daughter a couple of important life lessons: You will stand up to an injustice and that protesting against an injustice is a good thing to do. You might want to sit down with her and emphasize those lessons.\n\nYour brother and aunt are tone policing your daughter. Even if she HAD yelled that would have been justified.", "Ah yes because grabbing food off of someone else\u2019s plate without asking is the height of manners & proper social skills. Unfortunate it was at your mother\u2019s bday dinner but it all would\u2019ve been avoided if someone kept their hands to themself.

Even if she yelled that would be a very soft YTA.\n\nThat said, you should go to your mother and apologize for what happen. You technically did nothing wrong, but still it was her birthday so better to show a mature respond to your parent.\n\nI would put boundaries with your brother and also have a discussion with your daughter so she can understand the situation.", "Based on the details provided, I do not think you were the asshole in this situation. While your brother's actions of taking food off your daughter's plate was inappropriate, your reaction of calling him out for it was understandable as a parent defending their child. However, the name-calling and argument that ensued likely escalated the situation unnecessarily, especially during a family birthday dinner. \n\nIn the future, calmly addressing the issue and redirecting the focus back to your mother would likely be a more mature approach. Apologizing for the distraction after the fact may also help smooth things over. Overall though, wanting to protect your daughter is admirable - it's just best done without inflammatory language, as hard as that can be in heated moments. Your brother insulting your parenting was also uncalled for. You both could have handled this better, but losing your cool in the moment doesn't make you an asshole.", "NTA\n\nYour brother was trying some weird power play with a ten year old. He shouldn't have been doing that at his mum's birthday dinner. You're fine for defending your kid when he didn't listen and give the baji back.", "Nta there was a Dogberts Clues for thr Clueless, where it mentions 'fine dinning establishments provide addition forks for defending your plate' with a cartoon of a hand being stabbed.\n\nTaking food off someones plate is rude and he's pissy bc he got called on it.", "NTA. Stealing is wrong and needs to be called out, and your daughter did nothing wrong.", "NTA. I expect my kids to ask for something off my plate and I do the same for them. It's called mutual respect. Why expect it of them but refuse to give it in return?", "ESH - you all made a big fuzz about almost nothing", "Everybody is the asshole except the kid", "NTA\nIf he took food off my plate his hand would have met the business end of my fork. He was rude and a thief and your daughter was sticking up for herself.  Well done on raising a vocal child who will call out when she sees somwbody doing something wrong to her.", "They were sat catty corner to each other. She was between two of her brothers, and he was across from my oldest son. He had to reach right over my wife's plate to do this as well, which I also found insanely rude, but that was the least of his transgressions.", "No, my aunt wasn't on his side. She said \"If you took food off my plate, I wouldn't *yell* about it,\" implying she would do something else.", "My Mom is a wonderful mother. I don't know what happened with my brother.", "No, he is my older brother. However, we are only eighteen months apart, so it isn't a huge age difference.", "He thinks my kids have it better than we did growing up. Even if that were true (debatable) who cares??", "Thank you! I was wondering at the brother completely ignoring the irony here", "It was more of a startled exclamation. Maybe a yell, but certainly not a scream. It seemed like she was in disbelief that he just snatched food from her plate.", "How so?  He modeled appropriate defense of his child, and showed her that she should stand up to bullies. This is the kind of lesson that has lasting impact for a toddler; teaching them that they are people who deserve respect is a life-long lesson.", "Oh hell no. Someone reaches over my plate to touch someone else's, they arent getting their hand back.\n\nI worked in the toddler room at a daycare and those 2-3 year olds knew better. They would pass each other things and knew to raise their hands to request more food. Are you going to finish that? May I please have it?\n\nMy petty ass would be bringing a bib and extra snacks (specifically some toddler ones) for brother during the next family meal out.", "Ah, misunderstood that part, sorry. But still, he definitely was an ass.", "Maybe he needs a refresher course?", "Hmm, from the story i felt he had youngest sibling energy, very entitled and ironically spoiled, and that's coming from me, a youngest sibling", "i think it\u2019s a mark of success when later generations have a better and easier life than the last, when your children get to grow up better and more comfortable than you did. so your brother sounds even dumber to me now.", "His argument is that I \"spoil them\" because I \"always\" let them do things we couldn't/rarely could as kids. What he doesn't understand is that he usually only sees my kids on special occasions. Yes, I let my seven year old order a mango lassi, but that's because it was his grandmother's birthday and we were celebrating. At home they just drink water or tea with dinner, sometimes juice. My brother thinks what we let our kids do on special occasions is what we do everyday, which is ridiculous.", "NTA. Whenever you eat a meal with him, you must now steal something from his plate. Forever", "NTA. I think if I was writing a list of qualities that define someone as spoiled, close to the top of my list would be taking food from another person\u2019s plate without permission, calling the person names when they get upset about you taking their food, insulting their parents, then blaming everyone else for the scene you just caused.", "NTA - your brother clearly needs a.lesson in table manners. To reach over another ones plate is despicable. And stealing food from a child? What kind of person does that?", "Sounds like he was the one that was raised with no social skills...", "Are people really having family dramas over insignificant nonsense like this? People in the real world who have real jobs and probably face existential dread are fighting with their brothers over onion fritters?", "NTA. Your brother is a bully and thinks children self-advocating are spoiling his fun", "NTA. Good grief, how old is this guy?!", "NTA, I would never dream of taking food off my nieces and nephews, if they offered it, it would have been one thing, but to just blatantly take food from a child is just wrong", "NTA you were right to stick up for your daughter. Ok maybe getting into a heated discussion with your brother wasn\u2019t ideal but it\u2019s done now. Apologise to your mum and explain to her how you feel about what went down and that you didn\u2019t mean to upset her on her birthday but unfortunately you couldn\u2019t let it go because your brother was extremely rude taking food off someone else\u2019s plate.", ">I said you would never take food off of an adult's plate. He only felt confident enough to do that because she is ten.\n\nYeah right... If he has a girlfriend/boyfriend then he probably pulls the saaaaame fucking bullshit. You have to squash that habit the moment it happens since people don't give a fuck about default boundaries. This is an instance where it's acceptable to be an asshole in response to the crime. \n\n>I should be ashamed of letting my kids order so much on Dad's dime. \n\nWith that logic, he just took money out of your wallet without permission.
