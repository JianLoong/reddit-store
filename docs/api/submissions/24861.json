I would start seating myself between him and my kids to prevent this kind of thing in the future.", "NTA, your brother was being rude for no reason.", "NTA. Don't touch people's food.", "NTA. It was your brother who made the dinner awkward and messed with your mom's birthday dinner. And tbh your brother sounds less mature than a 3 year-old, so you weren't lying.", "NTA\n\nYour kids know when to properly stand up for themselves. He took food off her plate that (I'm assuming) while she was still eating, and food she was planning to eat without asking first. \n\nThe person with no manners is your brother. Or he thinks that adults have no reason to use manners or respect in interactions with children, which makes it even worse.", "NTA \n\nIt\u2019s the other way around. He\u2019s the spoil one for sticking his hands into your daughter\u2019s plate. Miss Manners would like a word with him.", "NTA. It is pathetic to steal food from your nieces and nephews instead of being an adult and asking \u201chey, niece, can I have one of those?\u201d.\n\nI\u2019m sensing a \u201cgolden child\u201d regarding your brother dynamic there, from your aunt and mom\u2019s reaction.", "NTA. If it happened during your mom's birthday dinner, then she got to see the outcome of her own child-rearing. Good for you for standing up for your kid.", "NTA in my opinion, the things you said were ultimately correct, your brother was the person continuing confrontation by repeatedly insulting your children and devaluing your parenting. When it was asked to be dropped and to not ruin your mother's dinner, you did just that without argument or attempts to justify yourself. As a side note, I'm guessing your brother is the youngest sibling?", "If everything is exactly as you described I'm on team NTA.\nSince when is it to hard to ask if you can have one fritter? And when you take one without asking and the person doesn't allow that you can certainly speak up.\nGlad you were on your daughters side and showed her that your brothers behaviour is out of line.", "NTA. Your brother behaved badly and then tried to pretend it was your daughter's fault for noticing he'd taken a bhaji right off her plate wihout asking. It's not being \"spoiled\" to expect that - even during a famiy dinner - a person will at least *ask*.  You are not the AH for defending your daughter - you shut up when your mom said to, and didn't pick a fight with your brother afterwards.", "NTA. Teach your kids to aggressively poke uncle with a fork if he wants to try that again and when he freaks out just say at least she didn\u2019t yell.", "NTA. \n\nMy uncle used to take food off my plate. I was really quiet and didn\u2019t say anything (shy awkward kid), my dad didn\u2019t either to keep the peace. I used to leave the meals hungry because he\u2019d take my food and I wouldn\u2019t have anything else", "NTA. Thank you for defending your daughter. Girls especially are not allowed to be vocal, so you letting her know she was correct to stand up for herself will do wonders for her self-esteem.", "NTA- your brother sounds entitled af and picking on kids is never cool", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Keep your frigging hands away from stuff that isn't yours.", "NTA. If he takes food off the wrong persons plate he's going to get poked with fork. And it's pretty good rule of thumb to not do something to a child you wouldn't do to a grownup. Your brother is absolutely an ahole for stealing a kids food and then saying they have bad manners for speaking up about it.", "NTA. You are teaching your daughter a couple of important life lessons: You will stand up to an injustice and that protesting against an injustice is a good thing to do. You might want to sit down with her and emphasize those lessons.\n\nYour brother and aunt are tone policing your daughter. Even if she HAD yelled that would have been justified.", "Ah yes because grabbing food off of someone else\u2019s plate without asking is the height of manners & proper social skills. Unfortunate it was at your mother\u2019s bday dinner but it all would\u2019ve been avoided if someone kept their hands to themself. NTA", "NTA", "NTA I\u2019ve always been very protective of my food and I don\u2019t even know why but when I say protective I mean the person who ate my food is getting one hell of a beating\n\nEdit: your brother got off light is what I\u2019m saying and your right he was only confident in doing it cause he was taking it from a little kid", "NTA. \"Why are you stealing from a child?\"", "If she indeed didn't yell, then NTA. Even if she yelled that would be a very soft YTA.\n\nThat said, you should go to your mother and apologize for what happen. You technically did nothing wrong, but still it was her birthday so better to show a mature respond to your parent.\n\nI would put boundaries with your brother and also have a discussion with your daughter so she can understand the situation.", "Based on the details provided, I do not think you were the asshole in this situation. While your brother's actions of taking food off your daughter's plate was inappropriate, your reaction of calling him out for it was understandable as a parent defending their child. However, the name-calling and argument that ensued likely escalated the situation unnecessarily, especially during a family birthday dinner. \n\nIn the future, calmly addressing the issue and redirecting the focus back to your mother would likely be a more mature approach. Apologizing for the distraction after the fact may also help smooth things over. Overall though, wanting to protect your daughter is admirable - it's just best done without inflammatory language, as hard as that can be in heated moments. Your brother insulting your parenting was also uncalled for. You both could have handled this better, but losing your cool in the moment doesn't make you an asshole.", "NTA\n\nYour brother was trying some weird power play with a ten year old. He shouldn't have been doing that at his mum's birthday dinner. You're fine for defending your kid when he didn't listen and give the baji back.", "Nta there was a Dogberts Clues for thr Clueless, where it mentions 'fine dinning establishments provide addition forks for defending your plate' with a cartoon of a hand being stabbed.\n\nTaking food off someones plate is rude and he's pissy bc he got called on it.", "NTA. Stealing is wrong and needs to be called out, and your daughter did nothing wrong.", "NTA. I expect my kids to ask for something off my plate and I do the same for them. It's called mutual respect. Why expect it of them but refuse to give it in return?", "ESH - you all made a big fuzz about almost nothing", "Everybody is the asshole except the kid", "NTA\nIf he took food off my plate his hand would have met the business end of my fork. He was rude and a thief and your daughter was sticking up for herself.  Well done on raising a vocal child who will call out when she sees somwbody doing something wrong to her.", "They were sat catty corner to each other. She was between two of her brothers, and he was across from my oldest son. He had to reach right over my wife's plate to do this as well, which I also found insanely rude, but that was the least of his transgressions.", "No, my aunt wasn't on his side. She said \"If you took food off my plate, I wouldn't *yell* about it,\" implying she would do something else.", "My Mom is a wonderful mother. I don't know what happened with my brother.", "No, he is my older brother. However, we are only eighteen months apart, so it isn't a huge age difference.", "He thinks my kids have it better than we did growing up. Even if that were true (debatable) who cares??", "Thank you! I was wondering at the brother completely ignoring the irony here", "It was more of a startled exclamation. Maybe a yell, but certainly not a scream. It seemed like she was in disbelief that he just snatched food from her plate.", "How so?  He modeled appropriate defense of his child, and showed her that she should stand up to bullies. This is the kind of lesson that has lasting impact for a toddler; teaching them that they are people who deserve respect is a life-long lesson.", "Oh hell no. Someone reaches over my plate to touch someone else's, they arent getting their hand back.\n\nI worked in the toddler room at a daycare and those 2-3 year olds knew better. They would pass each other things and knew to raise their hands to request more food. Are you going to finish that? May I please have it?\n\nMy petty ass would be bringing a bib and extra snacks (specifically some toddler ones) for brother during the next family meal out.", "Ah, misunderstood that part, sorry. But still, he definitely was an ass.", "Maybe he needs a refresher course?", "Hmm, from the story i felt he had youngest sibling energy, very entitled and ironically spoiled, and that's coming from me, a youngest sibling", "i think it\u2019s a mark of success when later generations have a better and easier life than the last, when your children get to grow up better and more comfortable than you did. so your brother sounds even dumber to me now.", "His argument is that I \"spoil them\" because I \"always\" let them do things we couldn't/rarely could as kids. What he doesn't understand is that he usually only sees my kids on special occasions. Yes, I let my seven year old order a mango lassi, but that's because it was his grandmother's birthday and we were celebrating. At home they just drink water or tea with dinner, sometimes juice. My brother thinks what we let our kids do on special occasions is what we do everyday, which is ridiculous."]}
