While your brother's actions of taking food off your daughter's plate was inappropriate, your reaction of calling him out for it was understandable as a parent defending their child. However, the name-calling and argument that ensued likely escalated the situation unnecessarily, especially during a family birthday dinner. \n\nIn the future, calmly addressing the issue and redirecting the focus back to your mother would likely be a more mature approach. Apologizing for the distraction after the fact may also help smooth things over. Overall though, wanting to protect your daughter is admirable - it's just best done without inflammatory language, as hard as that can be in heated moments. Your brother insulting your parenting was also uncalled for. You both could have handled this better, but losing your cool in the moment doesn't make you an asshole.", "NTA\n\nYour brother was trying some weird power play with a ten year old.

It seemed like she was in disbelief that he just snatched food from her plate.", "How so?  He modeled appropriate defense of his child, and showed her that she should stand up to bullies.

What he doesn't understand is that he usually only sees my kids on special occasions. Yes, I let my seven year old order a mango lassi, but that's because it was his grandmother's birthday and we were celebrating. At home they just drink water or tea with dinner, sometimes juice.
