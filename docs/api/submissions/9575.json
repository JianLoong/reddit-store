I packed my important belongings (Ex. Passport, clothes) and arranged with my best friend to crash at his apartment until I can find my own. Usually when small issues happen in a relationship, it ties into a bigger issue of that relationship. The main reason why I decided to break up is because I realized that her friends will always be closer to her than me. Sarah has favored her friends over me and blown off some of our plans for her friends more than once. I was lying to myself for years because I didn\u2019t want to face reality yet. I had hoped she would change, but this trip really opened my eyes that I will always be in 3rd place to her.I expressed my feelings multiple times, and Sarah promised she would change, and she didn\u2019t.\n\nSarah came home late yesterday. I said I have a lot to get off my chest and I want to get through my notes before she talks or tries to interrupt me. The first question I asked Sarah was \u201cHow she thought the trip went\u201d. She said we all had fun and it was memorable. I shouldn\u2019t have to feel like the 3rd wheel in my own relationship, especially on a trip that I planned.\n\nMy next question was \u201cWhy did you invite your friends in the first place? You knew this was an anniversary trip for US\u201d. She talked about the trip with her friends since the beginning, and they never been to CO. She thought it would be a good idea to allow them to come just so they can have fun in CO with us. I followed up with my lack of knowledge of her friends coming along until days before. It\u2019s one thing if they came and did their OWN activities. But it\u2019s another thing that every activity became a group activity. I signed up for a monogamous, not poly relationship.\n\nMy last question was \u201cDid you know that I was going to propose to you?\u201d. Sarah said she didn\u2019t know at all. The thought never occurred to Sarah that I was going to ask. She claimed that she wouldn\u2019t have invited her friends to come along if she knew, but I responded that \u201cit would ruin the surprise if I told you\u201d.\n\nSarah begged me to stay with her and believes we can work everything out. She didn\u2019t want me to throw 5 years away after this one bad trip. I listened to her promises to change for years regarding her friends, but nothing happened. I ultimately left Sarah with this: it\u2019s clear that there isn\u2019t enough room in your heart for your BF and your friends. As much as I love Sarah, I can\u2019t stay in a relationship where I\u2019m not respected enough. I left Sarah in the house by herself and I drove off to my friend\u2019s place.\n\nI\u2019ll figure out how to get my name off the lease and I\u2019ll plan to get the rest of my belongings. As for the ring, I will return it this weekend.", "created_utc": 1675984004, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10y99xi/update_aita_for_leaving_a_vacation_i_planned_for/", "score": 2797, "replies": ["Aside from the obvious issues of her behavior, the thing that throws me for the biggest loop is that she didn't \\*immediately\\* follow you home.   \nIf my partner had become upset enough that they \\*left our anniversary vacation early\\*, I would've been one step behind them to get home and unfuck whatever mess had been created, even if I thought that they were being unreasonable or dramatic about the whole thing. By staying, she basically said \"Your emotions and perspectives are not my priority and never will be\" in her actions. \n\n  \nI'm sorry it came to that, but I'm glad your friend is able to help you out and you're sticking to your own guns on your decision. Hopefully she learns from it; and if not, hopefully it's a situation you only ever have to encounter once in your life.", "Wishing you the best! Proud of you for putting your foot down.

She knew what she was doing.\n\nYou made the right call, especially the part about her friends being more important than a BF.  She won't learn anything from this either - she'll being leaning on those same friends and it'll reinforce her putting her friends first.\n\nGlad you realized what was going on and made the tough call.  You can't start a life with someone who isn't willing to put you first.", "> she didn\u2019t want me to throw 5 years away after this one bad trip.\n\nOuch, she forgot she was in a relationship with you whilst having the best time with her best friends on a trip you planned for her and you.

THE GOAT \ud83d\udc10 \n\nBut in all seriousness, you put yourself first for the first time in what sounds like a one way relationship. You deserve better, someone who actually cares.

You have enough self respect where you\u2019ll bounce back and know exactly what you want", "I read this on Facebook and thought I hope he realizes that she is not ready for a serious relationship. It is sad, but necessary for you to have someone who will give you \ud83d\udcaf percent back to match your \ud83d\udcaf percent. Good luck, take your time. You invested 5 years into this, possibly talk to a therapist or friend who will be able to objectively help you through this. GOOD LUCK", "> I will always be in 3rd place to her\n\nIf her friends come first and you're third, who's second?", "Oh, I'm sure this was a hard discussion to have, but I'm so happy you put yourself first. You've made the right choice, and you're taking all the right steps. You deserve so much more than you were getting. And I hope returning the ring goes without a hitch. I must admit I'm picturing her Pikachu face (as one commenter on the OP mentioned) when you told her about proposing. I wish you all the best, and I really would love to see a post from you when you meet the one you're meant to be with so we can all wish you the best. Take care!", "Dang, it almost seems anti-climactic that it wasn't more elaborate on her part about how this trip went, it turns out your gf was just a crappy girlfriend. I'm kind of glad, for your sake, that she turned it into a crappy trip. You deserve someone just as invested into the relationship as you are and she helped you to see that.", "Glad you found the strength to see yourself as always coming in second, or third, as the case may be.\n\n I think you did the right thing. Maybe she will grow up some day or find someone that she actually cares enough about to put first.\n\nYou will, there's no doubt. You seem to be an intelligent and well thought out kind of guy.\n\nYou did good, and have become a shining example of how one should handle these situations when they finally get a glimpse of reality.", "I'm so sorry you're going through this. The romantic in me wishes this is fixable. That this is just another round of AITA getting carried away and telling an OP  to leave at the drop of a hat.\n\nBut I think this is for the best.\n\nThis seems to have clarified long standing patterns of behavior for you, and once seen those are hard to gloss over or ignore. And she doesn't really want to change, she just wants to quick solve her current situation.\n\nI don't know you from Adam, but from your words posted here I think you're good guy with good insight and instincts. Best of luck to you. You deserve to be first in someone's heart.", "Wow.  I'm fully expecting another update where her friends and treating you like crap, and calling you shit for ruining her life.  \n\nBut reading this, how dense can a person be to not realize after 5 years that someone doing something just for the two of you is just for the two of you.", "Your exGF was too concerned with hanging out with her friends and not considering your feelings. Amazing that you plan a trip for your anniversary and she thought it was ok to invite her friends. Sounds like you have been plan B for most of your relationship. Sorry that she was too inconsiderate of your feelings and placed more value on her friends and not her could have been husband. Glad you made the decision to move on as much as it may hurt. Good luck to you.", "I think you did the right thing. I wish the best for you going forward, OP.", "My friends, married couple, are going on a trip overseas. As a friend group we've discussed going to this location as the friend group. At no point have any us assumed that their trip would be the friend trip. It's clearly time for them. The friend group wouldn't want to intrude. Maybe it's not her friends fault because it wasn't presented to them as a couples trip but I think it's weird your ex just decided to invite them. Without even talking to you. NTA at all.", "You were very mature, and I am proud of you. Your decision was great, and I hope it opens her eyes for her next relationship. It was for the better.", "You know she\u2019s going to cry, beg, and send her friends after you to tell you that you\u2019re wrong and should take her back.

I hope you find an actual partner in the future instead having to take the back seat", "FWIW, I think you made the right call. After 5 years and multiple promises to put you first, she's failed at every turn. Life is too short.", "I'm sorry that you feel like you wasted five years, but honestly.... GOOD FOR YOU for walking away instead of giving in and staying just because you've been together for so long. \n\nI wish you all the luck in the world in finding someone who will be your first priority and best friend partner, the \"us against the world\" companion you deserve.", ">My last question was \u201cDid you know that I was going to propose to you?\u201d. Sarah said she didn\u2019t know at all.\n\nDid she follow up on this regarding if you were going to still? Or did she get upset hearing that you were going to propose, but didn't?", "Thats some damn good maturity in your handling of it all. I know you probably couldn\u2019t post the whole conversation due to character limit, but those questions were very well worded.", "Was she even upset when you finally left? Seems like maybe not enough?  Also her friends, are they female, male a couple? What is that dynamic?", "Wow, good for you! I\u2019m sorry it all went down like that, but you responded with such a clear and level head. I\u2019m genuinely impressed.\n\nI also think you made the right choice. It\u2019s very telling that she said \u201cwe all had fun and it was memorable.\u201d Like\u2026. whaaaat? Did she not notice you left the trip days ago because you were unhappy?\n\nBest of luck! Glad your friends are there for support \ud83d\udc9b", "In a way I\u2019m conflicted with what to say because 1) Good on you man for knowing exactly how much value you deserve in your relationships, but at the same time 2) I\u2019m very sorry to hear that things ended. I wish you the best in life! Stay strong and keep your head up high. You made a decision that was best for you, and you should be proud of that.", "I AM SO PROUD OF YOU\u2026", "Go Little Rock star. You deserve someone to make you a priority \u2764\ufe0f", "Im glad you finally put your foot down. What she did was horrible. You deserved miles better and the fact this wasn't a one time thing speaks for itself and her priorities. I hope things get better for you and once your ready again I hope you find someone who deserves you.", "Good for you!  If my bf and I were going on an anniversary trip and my friends said it would be fun to join us, I\u2019d look them dead in the eye and ask if they were frigging kidding.  Couples need their own space to enjoy special moments together and the fact that not any of these 3 women thought of that shows how immature they really are.  They could always have done a girls trip some other time.", "I'm sorry that you've gone through this. But you've made the right decision in leaving.", "Oh I\u2019m so sorry. I really do hope the best for you moving forward", "I'm sorry OP, but this seemed the inevitable conclusion. Part of me hopes she sees this or the original post because I have a feeling her friends are going to continue to feed her the line that \"a real man wouldn't leave because of friends\" or something and try to cover over their bad behavior. I do have to ask (if you know), are her friends forever single? Or do they actually give time to their partners unlike your ex? I'm curious if they are hypocrites.   \n\n\nThat all said, I wish you luck and a speedy recovery (but hopefully take enough time for yourself as well)", "My condolences. I had something similar happen (it was a date that turned into a double date last minute where I got ignored in favor of her best friend) and it feels terrible.", "It\u2019s probably a weird thing to say but congratulations, it\u2019s always a difficult decision to break up after many years together.  Now you have made the decision, do not have any regrets.  Spend some time enjoying single life, do some traveling to places you would like to visit, spend time with your friends and family.  You will meet someone else who will put you first.", "tbh it might of been for the best. feel bad for Sarah since she finally realized what she messed up but sadly not all relationships work. quick question what will you do if she tries to contact you?", "You go king. You\u2019re lucky to have such great friends. Stay strong and focus on you.", "You did the right thing OP, I hope it all gets better for you. Good luck my dude.", "Best of luck to you.", "I agree with and support all your actions, but I have one little thing that bugs me a little: marriage proposals don't need to be surprises. Some people don't like surprises and would rather talk about their future marriage plans together equally. Many people actually resent surprises in general, and I wouldn't get hung up on a ruined surprise you planned because someone else didn't cooperate. Checking in more often with your partner, like once a year, may be a better plan.\n\nJust a bit of advice for your future, better relationship. Good luck! :)", "Good for you. I don\u2019t think people understand that respect or 1:1 time is the bare minimum in a relationship and having to basically beg for it is so upsetting specially if you\u2019ve asked for it multiple times. \nHope you give yourself some time to heal xx", "Proud of you OP. Good luck healing and moving forward!", "By going home to think, it gave you time to calm down and ponder. You entered the discussion with a cool head, instead of with high emotions.\n\nYou clearly expressed what you needed to say. \n\nYou emotional needs were not being met in this relationship. You did the right thing for you. \n\nGood luck to you.", "Good on you for getting out. You weren\u2019t her priority and never going to be.", "You did the right thing, OP. I'm glad you've freed yourself to find the right, loving woman who will respect you and make you THE priority", "HUG!", "You did the right thing. Sarah was not going to change, and her friends would always come before you.", "You did what I would have done. Now, go take care of yourself.", "I'll take things that never happened for $1000 Alex. If this guy did leave his own anniversary trip that his GF invited friends on and she stayed then he definitely got dumped when she got back from having that good time. She didn't try to work it out. He never presented his talking points. She kicked him out.", "I bet you won't get the ring back unless you sue", "Shit that didn't happen for 500 alex", "Exactly this. How are you in a 5 year relationship and let your partner leave a trip upset. She sounds pretty callous.", "Not to mention when he asked \u201cHow was the trip?\u201d She said \u201cit was great, and memorable\u201d she didn\u2019t even notice he was gone", "Exactly what I thought. She completely disregarded him and treated him like an accessory that she could have around when it pleased her. Hoping the best for OP, ending a relationship isn\u2019t easy but someone will see his worth and value him the way he values them.", "Yeah, not spouse material.", "I shouldn't have to fight for 1:1 time in a relationship, especially with a serious partner", "Exactly and the funny thing is when her friends get a significant other they will drop her...they won't invite her on their anniversary vacations...and could it be that her friends are partially responsible...who asks to go on someone else's anniversary vacation \nCould they have been jealous of the relationship?", "Also, Sarah may need to realize her friendships are too involved in her life. Geez. When dating my husband I had a friend who actively discouraged our dating and when things got serious, warned me repeatedly against marriage. Not because of any red flags. There were none. I realized it was just her projecting on me from her bitter divorce. (Married 15 years now and very happy, btw). But I had to pull back from my friend\u2019s poisonous attitude. \n\nI wonder how shocked Sarah will be when her friends find a relationship and she\u2019s cut off and out in the cold. I honestly wonder if she just isn\u2019t clueless that could/will happen.", "I just cant believe she didnt know he planned to propose! The only \u201creasonable\u201d reason I could imagine her bringing her friends into this would have been as a buffer to avoid an opportunity for the question to be popped. \n\nStill would have been a nasty immature thing to do for sure, but still makes more sense (in an awful, cruel way) than the reality of which she invited her friends to tag along on your 5 year anniversary trip and then focused the vast majority of her attention on them. \n\nBut given that this was apparently a pattern of hers that she would not fix despite past conversation being had\u2026.\n\nAlso what awful friends. \nMy two best friends are married to each other and we hang out plenty, but I could never imagine myself crashing their anniversary trip or anything like that.", "I would've hated to waste another 5 years with her. Too many people give their partners too many chances and end up wasting too much time on them.", "People don't take a step-back and truly look at the bigger picture and use their brain. I get that people want love and romance, so they often stay and give a million chances. \n\nI'm glad I got out before anything more serious happened", "I truly didn't expect my post to make it to MSN, Youtube, or any other media outlets! I feel like a celebrity.\n\nThank you for your support", "I think two friends went on the trip so he\u2019d be third behind them", "Herself, no doubt", "I'm guessing there's two main friends?", "*she's* her own first place, friends second\n\nETA didn't read good enough before replying, but still maintaining no matter who's where she's first", "I had to cut out a ton of information in my initial draft about this question. She did say \"we had fun as a group\". But she also said she saw that I was having a good time with her friends and everyone seemed happy. She did say things got awkward and weird after I left, so they didn't continue to have a good time.", "I know too many horror stories where people waste decades of their lives on someone. I get that relationships and love are hard work. But it's always important to know what your dealbreakers are and when to draw the line.", "The fairytale side of me wishes that it all could've magically been better. Some stuff can be fixed, but I didn't see any progress on Sarah's end to fix things.", "I'm not going to lie, I kinda hope there is an AITA post about her side of the story", "They already started doing that when he left the trip. I hope OP blocks them too!", "I hate that logic so much. \"We've been together for so long, why leave?\" That 5-year relationship turns into 10 years, and so on. And next thing you know, you've wasted decades on someone, instead of getting out much sooner.\n\nHappened to my aunt when she was in a bad marriage (cheating ex-husband). That \"one mistake\" wasn't fixed in therapy, so she wasted over 20 years on this guy because everyone kept telling her \"you've been together for so long, XXXX\"", "She didn't ask me if I was still going to propose. She got upset hearing that I was about to, but didn't", "I had twice the number of words in my initial draft!", "The two friends are women. And yes she was upset that I left. I told her I wanted to alone when I left CO. And I said don't blow up my phone after the breakup.", "I don\u2019t feel bad for her, sounds like she\u2019s been told multiple times how OP feels and she hasn\u2019t tried changing. This relationship didn\u2019t work out because of her, she only has herself to blame.", "If you read my initial post, we did talk about marriage and how we would ideally like to have a proposal. It wouldn't have been a complete surprise because we did check in with each other.\n\nSarah just assumed that it wouldn't happen on this trip", "He never proposed yet so she doesn't have it.", "I didn't propose at all", "Sadly, she never even gave him the opportunity to present it to her in the first place.", "It sounds like OP didn't give her the ring and meant that he's returning it to the jeweler he purchased it from.", "He never gave her the ring bc he never proposed, so that\u2019s one less problem to solve!", "And even worse, she had a good time.", "I had much more information in my post, but the character limit was too high.\n\nPart of the reason why she stayed back was because I said I wanted to go home alone and think. I know that couples shouldn't storm off after a fight, but it was kinda important to separate for a bit to gather my thoughts. \n\nMaybe things would've turned out differently if we left together?", "I had to cut out a ton of information in my initial draft about this question. She did say \"we had fun as a group\". But she also said she saw that I was having a good time with her friends and everyone seemed happy. She did say things got awkward and weird after I left, so they didn't continue to have a good time.\n\nWe talked a bit about our friends and how we never had personal issues with them. But our friend should never interfere with our couple time.", "Yeah there is a section that is dedicated to the new post on reddit if you don't have it. I just came on here to locate an update on you situation and comment. I am currently looking for another post I saw to comment right now.", "I really wish she\u2019ll see it somewhere and read the comments. Maybe then she\u2019ll realise how fucked up it was how she treated you. Doesn\u2019t mean you should take her back or whatever, but she should get confronted with what kind of a miserable girlfriend she was and what she did to you. Not just from what you tell her, (I guess her friends will tell her she\u2019s doing everything right and it\u2019s perfectly fine) but also from strangers on the internet who don\u2019t hold nothing back.", "I came to search to see if you did an update. I'm glad you are putting YOU first now!!", "That's exactly what I was talking about. Her two friends are in first and second place, then me", "Me too", "Oh boy.. let her or her friends post.. you now have thousands of new friends who will rip them apart.", "I am hoping he takes a picture of the ring and response with that to anyone giving him shit.", "Agreed, it's sad that people will stay together just because they think staying in a relationship they no longer feel loved is easier than finding someone new.\n\nYeah, my mom was vilified for leaving my abusive/cheating father because people kept kept telling her that the church wouldn't condone her leaving.  It's so sad for religious reasons too, that people outside the relationship will try and force someone to stay with a bad partner.", "Absolutely. That reasoning is literally the sink cost fallacy. \n\nI also don't think it's inherently time wasted - relationships that don't last are often necessary for us to learn about ourselves. It's healthy to have multiple relationships to learn about the possibilities and what we do and don't want.

We always loved each other, but it turned out we simply were not communicating the way we thought we were.\n\nWe did one exercise that was basically just one person would say how they were feeling, and the other would try to repeat it. It was shocking how often we were completely misunderstanding each other. I think we both learned we had never properly learned how to communicate in a relationship. I'm so glad we went to counseling as it's just changed everything with how we communicate.\n\nThe important thing of course though was that we both wanted to try and wanted to be together, and were willing to put the relationship first.\n\nSo if you do actually want to be together, but only if she can put you first, it might be worth considering relationship therapy while separated.

That I am nice and bring gifts. \nSo well, long story short, the nephew apologized to me (which made my heart melt), I stayed and felt part of the family. \nI also received a hug from the gifts I got him from christmas. \n\nWe now plan on going back for his birthday in 2 weeks and I'm gonna get him nerfguns to shoot at his dad. \nWhich hopefully again brings me a step up ^^ \n\nSo tbh, your gf should have put your feelings and easiness at the first place.

I had a friend like this. Would literally tell people to just show up on his dates and act like it was a coincidence.

She stayed in a 20+ year unhappy marriage because she invested so much time in it, so had kids with her ex-husband, and she tried to overlook and forgive his actions.

She wished she left years ago because she wasted so much energy on someone who doesn't deserve it.", "did you mean to just sort by new or something else?", "That is an excellent story and I'm proud of you. By standing up for yourself, you are sending a message to your child and the younger generation that you deserve respect in your relationship, and public appearances aren't a priority.\n\nLike your appearance isn't your first concern, its your self-respect and that you recognize that you deserve someone that truly loves you. \n\nMy cousins had to unlearn from their parents' unhealthy relationship.

She knew it was a shitty move and didn't tell him her friends were coming until days before the trip.  When they couldn't get any refunds.  So now he is the bad guy saying they can't come.  Her friends may not have known he was told so late (unlikely) but she knew exactly what she was doing by waiting.", "And when asked how the trip went she said she thought it was a good trip.\n\nOP completely dodged a bullet on this one.

Sorry that you had to go through this. But glad its over now. You can move on. Even if it 'was awkward after you left', I still cant fathom why she didn't leave after you left. If my SO had left early, I would have been right behind him, even if he said for me to stay. I wouldn't have been able to stay. But I also wouldn't have invited people on that kind of vacation. It doesn't matter if there was to be a proposal or not, if I knew that it was a romantic getaway, I wouldn't be inviting others.

He treated me like crap in front of our daughter and one day after his nasty words left me bawling while I did the dishes and my daughter took it all in, it dawned on me that if I didnt get away from him, she was going to grow up thinking this is how men treat the women they love.  She\u2019d marry someone who did the same things to her.\nI snapped that day and told him I wanted a divorce.  My daughter was two.

Thats not something she can just choose to change overnight just because she now knows she lost out on the ring.
