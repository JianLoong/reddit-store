Thank you for encouraging your niece to change her perspective and realize her worth. Too bad your brother is an AH and a cheapskate who is mad he can no longer take advantage of your niece. He should be ashamed of himself.", "NTA. He's pissed because he can't loan out her babysitting as favors to friends or drinking buddies anymore.", "    So, I was in a similar position..there is a village piece and there is also, what would the kid be doing otherwise piece. So, babysitting while mom gets groceries, goes to the doctor, you just do it.  It's part of being in a family. Saturday night when I wanted to be with friends, she paid me. If she wanted a date night I got paid. If she was in the hospital visiting a relative, no money. So, did you provide any nuance to that conversation? Or just told her to get paid? It was a very thoughtful conversation my mother had with me about expectations, what is family what was paid. It seems like she was being taken advantage of. So stepping up and helping her navigate the situation would have been better. She still lives with them and is a part of their family unit and you just went and created a ton of stress... But I dk if yta because I don't know how bad it was (abuse). Or if you just put your nose where it doesn't belong (contributing to the family, and you just messed up dynamics that could have been altered).", "NTA.

Her parents really should have been offering something in exchange but especially if they think it\u2019s okay to offer her services last minute to their friends.", "NTA Funny how that village is always the eldest teen girls\u2026.", "NTA. It takes a village for sure... But that village ain't doing it for free either. There is usually some sort of bartering system. I could never imagine not paying my teenage son to watch his own siblings . Let alone having him watch others for free...it doesn't have to be $20/hr... Some days All my son asks for is a large bag of chips... Teach your children their worth.. \"time is money\".", "NTA- they let their friends exploit their daughter too??? That\u2019s awful", "NTA we can only hope tho they won\u2019t punish her or force her into babysitting", "I would need to know more about the family dynamics.  In our household, we help each other out without the expectation of being paid. It takes a village kind of thing. One kid is particularly busy with school or extracurricular activity, the other one pitches in on chores. There is a strong sense of cooperation. My kids never expected payment for helping the family. \n\nAre the parents \"paying\" her in other ways? Car insurance? Gas? Buying her lots of clothes or whatever? Does she get an allowance and babysitting is part of her \"chores\"?", "NTA, you're a great uncle", "Nta. Her labour is valuable. And its not fair to take advantage or allow others to take advantage of free childcare. My older daughters watch their baby brother frequently. sometimes I pay sometimes I dont. There's no hard and fast formula but generally if it's hey please watch the baby while I run to the grocers I don't pay because I'm buying food which i will cook for the household of which they are part of and they benefit from. (And even though i dont \"pay\" they  benefit knowing im gonna show up with a favourite treat or ingredients for  a fav dinner as a reward)But if it's for something like I want to go get a manipedi or a date with the hubby then we pay the going rate. And they always have the option to say NO. Forcing older siblings to be responsible for the littles all the time and for free just fosters resentment in the long run and can hinder their bond.", "NTA \n\nHe's just pissed because you called him out! They need to pay her. She's 16 and they're lucky she hasn't gotten a job and can't babysit for them anymore. At this point, they're using her and if that's not bad enough, their friends are using her for free, too. That's not only mean , it's sad. Every 16 year old needs to earn money.", "NTA, she should be getting paid.", "NTA- buuuuut.....as usual, they are her parents and feed, cloth, shelter her, and probably going to pay for her college. I mean, I would give my kids money because i feel it would help them with responsibility and money management, but everyone has their own way. What she probably should have learned is how to negotiate, not demanding. Asking for a little money i bet was not the issue, but demanding it and saying if your late you pay me more probably was not the best approach. And she could have started with the parents friends....the whole, hey, if you can give her a little bit of money since she is trying to save for a car kind of thing.", "NTA\n\nYou were absolutely right to tell her that.

If they give her chores to do, there is no requirement that they pay her.  They \u201cpay\u201d for everything else. Her clothes, her food, her schooling, her recreation.\nI keep seeing this line of thought in this sub that since she didn\u2019t birth her siblings, she has no responsibility for them.  It\u2019s ridiculous, and a bit sad.  That\u2019s family. You care for family.  It shouldn\u2019t be transactional.

Maybe her parents are generous with their time and money on other ways and this is how she is expected to contribute to the family.   Kids shouldn't expect a free ride and should have to contribute to the running of the household in some way with chores etc.  It's not as simple as every piece of labour requires payment.

You go with what is likely more successful for you. \n\nI was oldest by 7 years and always watched my brothers when my mom went to school. She brought captian D's back for dinner. I know she worked and studied hard, so what little I could offer I was glad I could. I was grateful for what I had and she never let us go without, even though we didn't have much. Thank you for raising me. Thank you for what you do, even though it's in the \"job description\". I say this with tears in my eyes because she passed away last year, and I didn't have the chance to take care of her like she did me. She didn't have time for herself to enjoy.

While I think its reasonable for parents to leave kids with them while they run a quick errand, its 100% something different if they are gone for a whole day just to have some fun.

I get charged if I return library books late, I get charged if I return a rental car late.

The sanitation industry, food industry, and childcare industry are all great examples of that.

I am all for paying my kids as they plan on what they want to splurge on, but if they demand something from me after all I give, yeah, that will not rub me the right way. They come up and say they would like to earn some money to do something extra, then I am very much willing to work with that.\n\nIt ultimately about the approach. Demanding vs asking respectfully.

There was nothing in your post about making her change her last minute plans.  If they\u2019re doing that, then I\u2019ll change my answer to ESH, but I still don\u2019t think you \u201cowe\u201d your minor children compensation for watching their siblings.  That\u2019s how families work.

Because...she's a girl?\n\nOn the great future day when everyone everywhere automatically cares for children without squabbling over whether women are more suited for it biologically, we will all stop calling it \"women's work\".
