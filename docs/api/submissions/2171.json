Good for you to stand up for her.", "NTA. \nEven the parents' FRIENDS use her for free labor. She's 16. She can get a part time job if they don't want to pay her for her labor.", "NTA. \n\nAnd good for you, to teach your niece that \"women's work\" (specifically childcare) actually has monetary value.", "NTA. Thank you for encouraging your niece to change her perspective and realize her worth. Too bad your brother is an AH and a cheapskate who is mad he can no longer take advantage of your niece. He should be ashamed of himself.", "NTA. He's pissed because he can't loan out her babysitting as favors to friends or drinking buddies anymore.", "    So, I was in a similar position..there is a village piece and there is also, what would the kid be doing otherwise piece. So, babysitting while mom gets groceries, goes to the doctor, you just do it.  It's part of being in a family. Saturday night when I wanted to be with friends, she paid me. If she wanted a date night I got paid. If she was in the hospital visiting a relative, no money. So, did you provide any nuance to that conversation? Or just told her to get paid? It was a very thoughtful conversation my mother had with me about expectations, what is family what was paid. It seems like she was being taken advantage of. So stepping up and helping her navigate the situation would have been better. She still lives with them and is a part of their family unit and you just went and created a ton of stress... But I dk if yta because I don't know how bad it was (abuse). Or if you just put your nose where it doesn't belong (contributing to the family, and you just messed up dynamics that could have been altered).", "NTA. She needs to be paid for the time she gives up where she could be doing something else. Her half-siblings are not her kids, so not her responsibility. If the parents can't take care of the kids themselves and need a villiage, maybe they shouldn't have had them.", "NTA, but hopefully you also explained how demanding payment might cause issues in her relationship with her parents.", "NTA and good on you for advocating for her. Her parents really should have been offering something in exchange but especially if they think it\u2019s okay to offer her services last minute to their friends.", "NTA Funny how that village is always the eldest teen girls\u2026.", "NTA. It takes a village for sure... But that village ain't doing it for free either. There is usually some sort of bartering system. I could never imagine not paying my teenage son to watch his own siblings . Let alone having him watch others for free...it doesn't have to be $20/hr... Some days All my son asks for is a large bag of chips... Teach your children their worth.. \"time is money\".", "NTA- they let their friends exploit their daughter too??? That\u2019s awful", "NTA we can only hope tho they won\u2019t punish her or force her into babysitting", "I would need to know more about the family dynamics.  In our household, we help each other out without the expectation of being paid. It takes a village kind of thing. One kid is particularly busy with school or extracurricular activity, the other one pitches in on chores. There is a strong sense of cooperation. My kids never expected payment for helping the family. \n\nAre the parents \"paying\" her in other ways? Car insurance? Gas? Buying her lots of clothes or whatever? Does she get an allowance and babysitting is part of her \"chores\"?", "NTA, you're a great uncle", "Nta. Her labour is valuable. And its not fair to take advantage or allow others to take advantage of free childcare. My older daughters watch their baby brother frequently. sometimes I pay sometimes I dont. There's no hard and fast formula but generally if it's hey please watch the baby while I run to the grocers I don't pay because I'm buying food which i will cook for the household of which they are part of and they benefit from. (And even though i dont \"pay\" they  benefit knowing im gonna show up with a favourite treat or ingredients for  a fav dinner as a reward)But if it's for something like I want to go get a manipedi or a date with the hubby then we pay the going rate. And they always have the option to say NO. Forcing older siblings to be responsible for the littles all the time and for free just fosters resentment in the long run and can hinder their bond.", "NTA \n\nHe's just pissed because you called him out! They need to pay her. She's 16 and they're lucky she hasn't gotten a job and can't babysit for them anymore. At this point, they're using her and if that's not bad enough, their friends are using her for free, too. That's not only mean , it's sad. Every 16 year old needs to earn money.", "NTA, she should be getting paid.", "NTA- buuuuut.....as usual, they are her parents and feed, cloth, shelter her, and probably going to pay for her college. I mean, I would give my kids money because i feel it would help them with responsibility and money management, but everyone has their own way. What she probably should have learned is how to negotiate, not demanding. Asking for a little money i bet was not the issue, but demanding it and saying if your late you pay me more probably was not the best approach. And she could have started with the parents friends....the whole, hey, if you can give her a little bit of money since she is trying to save for a car kind of thing.", "NTA\n\nYou were absolutely right to tell her that. She shouldn't be letting everyone take advantage of her generosity.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If they give her chores to do, there is no requirement that they pay her.  They \u201cpay\u201d for everything else. Her clothes, her food, her schooling, her recreation.\nI keep seeing this line of thought in this sub that since she didn\u2019t birth her siblings, she has no responsibility for them.  It\u2019s ridiculous, and a bit sad.  That\u2019s family. You care for family.  It shouldn\u2019t be transactional.  They aren\u2019t making her raise them, she\u2019s babysitting her siblings and there is no reason she should \u201cexpect\u201d payment.", "INFO - it depends on the family dynamic.  Maybe her parents are generous with their time and money on other ways and this is how she is expected to contribute to the family.   Kids shouldn't expect a free ride and should have to contribute to the running of the household in some way with chores etc.  It's not as simple as every piece of labour requires payment.  You may be right - she may be being taken advantage of. If you don't know, then Y T A for inserting yourself in an uninformed way.", "NTA I hope you also encouraged her to research and charge market rate for her services, especially to her parents' friends.", "You could just say childcare. You don\u2019t have to put the extra sexism in there", "Ding, ding, ding.", "Exactly. But the friends should pay regardless. It's all about how it should be presented. Demanding vs requesting. You go with what is likely more successful for you. \n\nI was oldest by 7 years and always watched my brothers when my mom went to school. She brought captian D's back for dinner. I know she worked and studied hard, so what little I could offer I was glad I could. I was grateful for what I had and she never let us go without, even though we didn't have much. Thank you for raising me. Thank you for what you do, even though it's in the \"job description\". I say this with tears in my eyes because she passed away last year, and I didn't have the chance to take care of her like she did me. She didn't have time for herself to enjoy. We talk about money, but really matters is family.\n\nWith that said, I am not opposed for asking for something for watching the kids, especially the friends kids. In the end, if it's something parents can afford, it will help her in long run.", "I told her it's one thing if it's just a few hours while they do necessary stuff like groceries but if they're going to a concert or they expect her to drop her plans then there should be payment.\n\nI know some women who don't know the power and value of their labour because they've been gas light in regards to baby sitting", "THIS RIGHT HERE. I think I'm going NTA based on OP's comments, which I wish he'd add as an edit to his post. While I think its reasonable for parents to leave kids with them while they run a quick errand, its 100% something different if they are gone for a whole day just to have some fun. AND definitely OP is right about demanding payment if she babysits anyone else's kids. NTA at all.", "Yes thank you, I basically told her the same. I told her that watching them for a few hours while the parents do necessary stuff like groceries is one thing but she should charge if if for a long period of the me or if the parents want to go out for leisure activities", "Yeah, they are her parents, feeding her, clothing her, and putting a roof over her head is kind of in the job description. Her parents shouldn't be expecting her to watch her half-siblings for free, seeing as they aren't her children. She should demand money, she providing a service, and she should be getting paid.", "I understand your point but many babysitters complain about parents returning late. I get charged if I return library books late, I get charged if I return a rental car late. Why is it ok for parents to be casually late.", "Feeding, clothing, and sheltering her is the bare minimum of parenting. \n\nExpecting them to watch the younger kids because you\u2019re too cheap to hire a babysitter, not ok.", "And what about for the parents friends?", "Ok so if they decide to go camping for the weekend or they expect her to drop her plans because \"they're overwhelmed\" that she should expect nothing and to suck it up?", "You have to recognize that jobs historically left for women are criminally undervalued monetarily in our society. The sanitation industry, food industry, and childcare industry are all great examples of that. Even though the jobs are no longer done primarily by women, they\u2019re treated as lesser and given a lower value than they deserve. It\u2019s not sexism, it\u2019s context.", ">I told her it's one thing if it's just a few hours while they do necessary stuff like groceries but if they're going to a concert or they expect her to drop her plans then there should be payment.\n\nYou should edit this into your post. It would satisfy those who are on the fence because their family dynamics are different. \n\nHowever, did I understand that they also expect her to babysit for friends without being paid? That's completely crossing the line.", "THIS - Thank you for being a thoughtful uncle who cares and stands up for your niece. NTA", "She doesn't need the newest fancey clothes, the newest name brand shoes, or going to the concerts, money to go out with friends then. I am all for paying my kids as they plan on what they want to splurge on, but if they demand something from me after all I give, yeah, that will not rub me the right way. They come up and say they would like to earn some money to do something extra, then I am very much willing to work with that.\n\nIt ultimately about the approach. Demanding vs asking respectfully. The life lesson is you don't go around demanding. Just as you don't \"not speak up\". Speaking up in a manner that can be respected is what we should be teaching kids.", "Goal is to get paid first. I am on the side of paying, but got to get paid first. All other demands are meaningless until then", "So, wait, you think it would be acceptable to leave a 16 year old home alone with her younger siblings while the parents go on a weekend camping trip\u2026as long as they pay her?!\n\nAlso, not judging the \u201clast minute plans\u201d bit.  There was nothing in your post about making her change her last minute plans.  If they\u2019re doing that, then I\u2019ll change my answer to ESH, but I still don\u2019t think you \u201cowe\u201d your minor children compensation for watching their siblings.  That\u2019s how families work.  I think it\u2019s fine if you want to show your appreciation for their maturity, reward them for being a great big sister, etc. but there shouldn\u2019t be an expectation of payment, especially not when their uncle is the one setting the expectation.", "OP didn\u2019t even mention it being \u201cwomen\u2019s work\u201d this is about babysitting and not all babysitters are going to be women. The commenter I replied to originally, didn\u2019t add anything to the discussion by calling it that.", "THIS. NO WAY should niece be babysitting for anyone other than parents unless she's being paid. And even parents should pay her if they are gone for a significant amount of time. NTA", "I understand not demanding stuff, I do. You are right we should be teaching kids how to negotiate, how to invest, how to save, and how to speak up respectfully. However, when there are people in a position of power for example her parents, that are taking advantage of the person that they have power over I don't think being polite is necessary. They used their daughter for free child care, that's messed up, she realized it was messed up and she demanded to be paid. I don't think that's wrong.", "Beg to differ: the sexism is already operating. \n\nI highly doubt a 16yo BOY would be routinely tasked to take care of other people's children (along with his own siblings) at the last minute, without at least being offered money. \n\nYet they're exploiting OP and expecting her to do it for free. Because...she's a girl?\n\nOn the great future day when everyone everywhere automatically cares for children without squabbling over whether women are more suited for it biologically, we will all stop calling it \"women's work\". Until then...if it's domestic, poorly-paid or unpaid, arduous, disrespected, dismissed and messy -- chances are, that's what it's called."]}
