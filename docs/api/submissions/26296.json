She had an outdoor wedding that had limited bathroom availability. Obviously because it was outdoors, she rented four of those, not a porta potty like you would see at idk a construction site, but a nicer portable one that's longer that they might setup for more sophisticated outdoor events like tennis or polo. Two for women, two for men, four total. The wedding in total was about 150-200 ppl. \r  \n\r  \nI should also mention that due to some health problems, I started taking a medicine that has possible side effects as diarrhea. When you look up medicines which have a million side effects, you tend to just take that and say, well they have to say it has all that, I still need to take the medication. I didn't think to mention this to anyone for a number of reasons 1. As I just side, medicine side effects vary depending on what it is, and commercials and scripts usually overstate them. 2. What am I going to say to her before the wedding, that I'm taking his medication and it might have side effects in general? I've never struggled with incontinence or IBS or anything like that in the past.\r  \n\r  \nIt's a little while before the ceremony is about to start, and I'm being pulled into a million directions helping out, and I start to feel a bit of a stomach ache, and then we all get shuffled up to the front without warning. Whatever, I'm at the wedding, I can't go run out for tums, it will be fine. Pachelbel starts playing, everything is in place. \n\n\r  \nAll of a sudden, I feel a deep pain in my bowels. For twenty seconds I'm just standing there thinking, do I have to go, what do I do, just, idk, trying to process the situation while remaining composed. It happens. I'm not going to go into detail here because it was embarrassing and traumatizing, needless to say I excused myself. \n\n\r  \nAfter dealing with the whole situation, I was there standing outside the bathroom not sure what to do next. I had assumed the ceremony had continued to go on, do I go back? There's no way. They're in the middle of their vows, and here comes shit girl. So I waited a while as to not interrupt anything.\r  \n\r  \nTwo of the other bridesmaids found me crying eventually and told me that Sarah was upset and said I should leave, so I did, in shame. It all happened over the weekend, and its now Tuesday night. I had sent an apology text to Sarah, but I haven't heard anything from her or anyone else in the wedding party. Am I the asshole for ruining the wedding and not letting my friend know about my medication?\r  \nAITA?\r  \n\r  \nTLDR: Had an accident at a wedding in the wedding party, was told to leave, and did. Now my friends wont talk to me. Should I have said something beforehand about the meds I was taking?

How were you supposed to predict that?? You can't know the future, and meds always list a million possible side effects, most of which never happen.\n\nI am married. If this had happened to one of my friends in the middle of the wedding, I would have been terribly concerned for them. I wouldn't for an instant be *mad* at them. \n\nAre your friends married now? Yes? Then you didn't ruin their wedding. They did it.\n\nGracious. I am actually pretty upset on your behalf. Your friends, ironically, are pretty shitty.", "NTA.  A good friend would have checked on you and made sure you were okay.  I don't know when brides started acting so entitled and crazy, but it's insane they can't act maturely and behave like they care about others despite the fact that it's their wedding day!", "NTA. Shit happens. \n\nPSA: if you have four toileta at a wedding and don't want them unisex designate three of them for women.", "NTA. \n\nObvious accident and really, somebody should have checked to see if you were okay.", "Your meds are your business. Unfortunate that the event had your friend down in the dumps. As yes, it would. But it was an accident you couldn\u2019t have predicted. I would think you would have wanted to leave. But sounds like she dumped you and is ghosting you now. Doubt even Depends could have spared you.", "My friend\u2019s bridesmaid last year had to leave 1 hr before the wedding because her dog ran away and was nowhere to be found. What did my friend say? \u201cPlease let me know if I can do anything to help!!\u201d Sarah sucks. NTA.", "NTA, not at all. You poor thing, you must have felt so embarrassed. If I was the bride I would be doing whatever I could to reassure you and support you.\n\nI hope your health improves, and that you find some better friends.", "NTA. Sorry you have crap friends that aren\u2019t a bit more understanding, does she think you did this on purpose or something?! Think I\u2019m on your side just because a medication listed that as a side effect I wouldn\u2019t really be expecting it to that extent.", "NTA. Would she have been mad if you had a random seizure? It's nothing you could have controlled.", "I was my best friends maid of honor, right  at the beginning  of the ceremony, a massive migraine hit me with the auras associated with it. I tried to stay but ended up excusing myself. I sat with her parents, and she was totally understanding. She was more worried about me than ruining her wedding. Still best friend to this day thirty years later.", "INFO:  was the first time you experienced this side effect?", "Tell her bluntly what happened and how you attempted to handle it.  Either she loves you and accepts your shitty self, or not.  Either way you are better off knowing.  \n\"Sorry, my meds acted up and I shit all over myself. I was able to clean up, but left because...\nI hope your day was amazing and the only shitty thing was those panties I had to throw away\"", "NAH\n\nTbh, I don't really know why you wouldn't go straight home. If I'd obviously shat myself I wouldn't then be like 'well, I'll just hang around for a few more hours at this formal event covered in my own shit', I'd go home, shower and change and then potentially (depending on length of event, distance, etc) see if coming back for the reception was an option.\n\nYou're obviously N T A but I don't know what you expected from the bride. Should she have stopped her wedding and come sat in the portaloo while you cleaned up your shit? Should she be spending the first day or two of her honeymoon worrying about this as her priority?\n\nEither it was subtle enough that you appear to have just run out of her wedding for no reason (which may be her impression) or dramatic enough that you hanging around the venue for ages after was a misstep.", "NAH. She should have been kinder to you. Her anger and blame was misplaced. In a situation like this there\u2019s truly no one at fault. I\u2019m not sure why you expected to stay at the wedding after the accident though\u2026 she shouldn\u2019t have had to tell you to leave. Unless you had access to a shower or something? The one time this happened to me\u2026 it was straight to the shower asap. \n\nI\u2019d give her some grace and some space for now. She doesn\u2019t want to talk to you on her honeymoon and that\u2019s ok. \n\nSome women dream of their wedding their whole life and to have everyone leaving talking about how they witnessed a bridesmaid have an accident during the vows vs. the beautiful ceremony / blushing bride / great food / music, etc. majorly sucks. I would be devastated that it was the lasting impression people would have and the main thing they remember about our day.", "NTA - you didn\u2019t want to do what you did but had no control over it. \n\nIt\u2019s one of those situations where both parties are right. You can be upset because it wasn\u2019t your fault and obviously didn\u2019t mean for it to happen, you just couldn\u2019t do anything about it. They can be mad that you ruined what was supposed to be their perfect night even though you didn\u2019t mean to. You will just have to make your peace with it. Good luck.", "NTA. I understand why the bride was upset, but she was the AH here ultimately.", "NTA, but hopefully you find or make friends that you can talk poop with. The last wedding I was a bridesmaid in we had a medicine kit packed by the bride with all the pain relievers and anti diarrheals you could need. (It was awesome, all medical things like eye drops, neosporin, bandages etc.) it\u2019s her travel kit. We also talked about our bubble gut before the wedding and I\u2019m pretty sure almost every girl had diarrhea before the vows. It\u2019s a very understanding group of gals and I was so happy to be a part of it.", "NTA. As you said, the majority of people don't experience side effects, yet the drug company has to list them all. Your \"friend\" should have understood. It's hard to believe that her whole wedding was ruined by your unfortunate complication. God help the marriage if that's true because she's focused on the wrong thing.", "I was sick at a friend\u2019s wedding where I was a bridesmaid and I began to faint when I was standing up there. I motioned to another bridesmaid and she literally pulled me off the altar to a back room where a nice nun gave me smelling salts and got me water. If the other maid hadn\u2019t reacted quickly I would have fainted right then and there.  I was of course embarrassed but the bride was only concerned that I was ok. (I had been sick but I hadn\u2019t told her as I didn\u2019t want her to worry. This was pre-Covid and I was past the point of contagiousness.)", "Even if you had told her, the outcome would\u2019ve been the same. I\u2019m sorry this happened to you. I wish your friend wasn\u2019t so uptight. The best weddings are the chill ones. NTA", "NTA at least you weren\u2019t on a flight to Barcelona", "NAH. You couldn't help yourself. But it's also totally normal for the bride to feel sad/angry, even if she knows it wasn't your fault. She isn't a bridezella: the ceremony is THE most important part of the wedding where the couple declare their love for eachother. And it turned into poopfest. This is what everyone would have talked about during the day and will remember the wedding by. \n\nSo whilst it wasn't your fault, it still sucks for everyone involved.", "NTA, and it was pretty awful of your friend to be upset with you and not to check up on you. If it were me and this happened to my friend, checking on them would have been my first priority. I\u2019m so sorry that happened to you, OP", "INFO: are you actually sure your friend is actually mad at you though? I mean sending you home seems like the only practical solution at that point rather than a punishment. There\u2019s only so well you can clean up in a port-a-potty VS going home and taking a shower, and now she\u2019s presumably on her honeymoon so probably not responding much to anyone other than her new husband. Also unless you had an obvious stain or left a little shit trail all the way to the loo it probably wasn\u2019t as obvious as you think it was.", "NTA how were you to know that it would be so bad you couldn\u2019t get to the bathroom quick enough? The only time you expect the side effect to be that bad is colonoscopy prep. \n\nIt\u2019s awful that you missed the ceremony, but is having one bridesmaid missing really enough to ruin an entire wedding?  I don\u2019t think so. And to dismiss you from the entire rest of the wedding and reception is just ridiculous.  You didn\u2019t do it on purpose you couldn\u2019t help it.  She should\u2019ve been more sympathetic for something embarrassing happening to you.\n\nEdit: I didn\u2019t realize that it happened quite as publicly as it did and thought that she was mostly upset because you were missing during the ceremony.  Give her time it was upsetting for everyone from the sounds of it.", "NTA. I do want to verify (and I'm sorry to ask this) that she was aware it was a medical emergency? Like she didn't think you'd just run out in the middle of the ceremony for no reason?", "NTA\n\nYour friends are total AH's though. True friends would have rallied to your side and wanted to make sure you were okay. They would have found you a change of clothes. They would have been more worried about you than the ceremony, even if it was the bride. **The fact that they got mad and told you to leave over a medical problem tells you they are trash people.**", "You\u2019re NTA for having an uncontrollable medical accident", "What a shitty situation", "NTA, Not Your Asshole. Sorry about your friends, it should have been obvious to them your situation could not be helped", "NTA You had a minor medical emergency due to medication side effects. While I understand it was her special day, the way she and her wedding party ghosted you says a lot about her as a \"friend\"", "Did they get married?\n\nThen the wedding wasn't ruined.\n\nNTA", "Accidents happen and you blessed the guests with not sharing it during the wedding. Just imagine if you hadn\u2019t left\u2026 there would have been more than rose petals on the floor.  BTW\u2026 hope you get better.", "Okay you're definitely not the asshole. I was my best friends best man, and the wedding had an open bar. Our other best friend who was a groomsman ended up drinking far too much and he was found naked in the brides room bathroom with an insane amount of vomit all over the bathroom counter which had all of the girls makeup, and other things that would be easily ruined by vomit. Me and another groomsman cleaned everything up and our friend, and everyone at the wedding had a really good laugh about it. He wasn't the only groomsman who threw up in a bad place either, the one who helped me clean threw up on the stairs up to the bride and grooms room. I cleaned that up on my own. As the best man I took care of it and everyone made light of the situation. It's sad that things were taken so seriously after you had to deal with that embarrassment.", "Maybe they will edit that part out of the wedding video.  The sad thing is you just know it will be all over YouTube and ticktock.  Time to change the color and style of your hair.  And memorize this phrase: \"it's crazy that that shit girl looks like me.  They do say everyone has a twin.\". This too shall pass and even the bride may one day think it's funny in 20 or 30 years.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

There was an unexpected dilemma (happens all the freaking time at weddings). The fact that she cares more about herself than how embarrassing this was for you, speaks volumes of her character and her view of your friendship. \n\nI have IBD, and I was in a wedding last April. I get very nervous about big events like that, because I genuinely cannot hold in my bowel movements at times. Especially if I\u2019m nervous. My friend knows I have IBD, but that wasn\u2019t ever mentioned prior to the event. No one plans to shit their pants - medication or not, IBD or not.

It's bad enough to go through this. You shouldn't have to deal with the guilt on top of that and they should be reassuring you of that. Of course no one would ever intentionally do something like this. It's not your fault. Even if you had told someone you are taking a medication that has possible side effects, would you tell them every possible side effect? What would they do with that info? Tell you that you couldn't be in the wedding? I don't think so. That's crazy anyone would be mad at you.

It is absolutely horrifying when you know it's going to happen, especially if you are away from home, let alone at the front of a wedding ceremony.  You are NTA, but do give the bride an opportunity to enjoy her honeymoon and perhaps gain some perspective before you try to contact her again. \n\nIn order to lessen your anxiety for the future, try to recognize food triggers so you can plan accordingly.  And it's helpful to keep a tote or backpack with a change of clothes, wipes, hand sanitizer, ziplock & small trash bags and a deodorizer/air freshener spray nearby whenever you leave the house.

You might have said something to another bridesmaid before you excused yourself but that depends how well you know them. If you just had to go and couldn\u2019t hold it you should have said something honestly and then hopefully the bride could decide to hold the ceremony 10-15 minutes or go on without you.

It is not your fault.", "NAH, but you do sound a bit irresponsible with taking a new medication. I find most doctors will go over what a medication is likely to do, and if not I ask if it's a 1 or 2 issue type of appointment. There isn't always time, but then I talk to the pharmacist. Many medications have side effects that affect the majority of people, these aren't all rare things.\n\nAs for things you could have done to prevent?

While the bride should certainly forgive you, keep in mind that she probably spent a year or more planning this event and a considerable sum of money and now all everybody will be talking about is your accident. She needs time to process this and mourn this. As someone who was seriously disappointed with something that happened at my own wedding I only got over it once I got photos and videos that did not feature the incident and I was able to replace \u201ctrauma memories\u201d with memories of all the wonderful things that went right during the day. The human brain works in strange ways such that we remember the traumatic things more than the happy things that happen to us.

There was no spite, no intention to harm - just someone with a stomach ache. If that happened at my wedding my concern would be only for the friend it happened to.", "If you were my friend, I would want to make sure you are ok. An adult crapping themselves is not normal? so obviously something was wrong and she doesnt care? a friend that regarded you so highly that put you in her wedding party. \n\nThat was probably very humiliating for you, over time the feeling will fade though but I dont think you will soon forget how your friends treated you. NTA", "Thank you, it's really comforting to hear you say that. I've been feeling like it's my fault, but this thread has been helpful.", "I agree. \n\nThe bride is mad at OP and asked her to leave?! She can fuck right off with that. \n\nOP is NTA for having human functions we can't always anticipate or control.", "I would have been concerned and then I would have teased my friend for the rest of our lives about getting the poops during my wedding.", "Weddings are celebrations but not tv productions.  Things will happen, and brides need to quit whining about \u201cruining my special day\u201d and \u201cspoiling my vision of the day.\u201d", "It happened when we started putting too much emphasis on the fact that you should (in theory, I guess) only get married ONE time, therefore \u201cyou gotta make it count\u201d. \n\nWe\u2019ve also fostered a culture where people only feel important if everyone is looking, talking, gushing over, bragging about, only YOU. \n\nSo brides go absolutely feral if that one chance at being the center of attention, the celebrity on the spotlight, is threatened in ANY way. \n\nGood or bad, if the attention is diverted, then it\u2019s not perfect. \n\nIt\u2019s honestly been a combination of things over the years. It starts with how you\u2019ve parented your child or they\u2019ve grown up. Have they heard the word NO ever? Are they spoiled? Are they envious of others and greedy? Have they been taught what kindness, empathy, compassion, and loyalty are?\n\n\nOPs friend dared to do something that will have her friends guests talking about it all night, made worse by her telling her to leave. So they aren\u2019t focused solely on her ( and this expectation is just ridiculous).\n\nIn fact, if bride had paused the ceremony for a few minutes and excused herself, Checked on op, and somehow salvaged the dress for her to stand back up there, and showed her loyalty or empathy towards op, the guests would\u2019ve followed suit (at least been waaaay less mean gossip and maybe more concerned or fyi gossip). \n\nBut let\u2019s be real, Sarah would\u2019ve been pissed if she\u2019d run for a bathroom (and made it on time), if she informed Sarah at all she\u2019d be pissed, I\u2019d she made a mess she was pissed, yadda yadda. Sarah wasn\u2019t going to care until it inconvenienced her and it\u2019s lose lose.", "Incredibly cruel to be kicked out of a wedding after such an emergency.  Op should not be apologizing", "Thank you for including so many dump/poop related puns in your answer, very much appreciate it /s\n\nI actually do appreciate the comment otherwise tho.", "was puppy found???", "That situation is a tad different because it did not interrupt the ceremony. From the way OP is wording it, it seems like the event may have occurred during the ceremony itself or during the procession down the aisle. The bride should still forgive OP once she has cooled down but your anecdote is def not the same as causing a scene during the ceremony or procession.", "Yes. Yes, she would. Because the bride is TA.", "I have epilepsy. Yes people get mad at you for having seizures all the time. Good way of illustrating the point though because all sorts of awful things - for example, a random seizure - could have happened to OP and no one came to check where she was? Not just the bride that's an asshole, sounds like the kind of wedding that's a bit of a viper pit", "Yes. I'd had some stomach pain, gas, but nothing like this.", "I wouldn't even bring the meds into it.  She'd only end up blaming OP for taking them in the first place.  She already knows what she needs to know - that OP had an unforeseen unavoidable incident.", "Yes it just isn\u2019t the kind of thing you want guests to remember as the highlight of the wedding. Unfortunately this will be what many people remember.", "Well stated. I didn\u2019t realize when I first read the post that it happened in front of everyone.  It could even be that the rest of the wedding party is so shocked that they just don\u2019t know how to handle something embarrassing like this.", "I\u2019m not sure the friend is actually mad though. She\u2019s focused on her wedding that she planned, paid for and invited guests to. she sent bridesmaids to check on OP and send her home. Being upset at the situation is not the same as being upset at OP. And not wanting to talk to OP during her honeymoon is reasonable too.\n\nOP\u2019s in a stall crying with her dress full of crap. What else would the bridesmaids say except \u201cI think it\u2019s time for you to leave\u201d. Someone should have offered her a ride and made sure she was ok but no, as a bride I\u2019m not stopping my wedding to hang out in a bathroom and console someone about an inopportune bowel movement. If the medical emergency is ongoing, let\u2019s get an ambulance. If not, go home, shower, get some rest and we\u2019ll talk AFTER THE HONEYMOON. \n\nWhy do people think that OP should have been allowed to stick around in soiled, smelly clothes?", "Based on OP\u2019s comments the wedding was \u201cruined\u201d bc OP had the accident DURING the ceremony in front of all the guests", "It wasn't just that I had run out of the ceremony, it was (and maybe I'm being paranoid because I'm so embarrassed) I had obviously soiled myself.", "This is wild to me. The one time I had unexpected diarrhea, I was trying on clothes with a fitting room attendant outside the stall. I had to explain what happened completely mortified, hand her the clothing tags and my credit card so so I could buy the clothes I was wearing and rush out the store asap. I couldn\u2019t get home fast enough for PRIVACY to shower, take some Imodium and lay down. It was not a group activity and I did not need an audience to attend to and console me through my diarrhea episode. My god. \n\nWTF would OP even be doing at a wedding after shitting her pants? A change of clothes\u2026 without showering??? \ud83e\udd22\ud83e\udd22\ud83e\udd22", "I mean\u2026 if anybody pooped in their clothes at any gathering, I think it\u2019s appropriate to ask them to leave instead of staying in soiled clothing.", "But based on OP\u2019s comments it DID happen in front of all of the guests!", "You were a great best man, but the big difference here is that these things happened in private and not in front of all the guests during the ceremony.", "I have seen some of those rented bathrooms that are actually quite fancy.", "According to the comments she did shit herself during the ceremony and it was obvious! I can\u2019t imagine how mortifying.", "There was no \"fault\" here. Except for your friend being an A.\n\nYou had an embarassing medical event, in public. If you were my friend, in my wedding party, I'd have used that big damn dress to conceal you to somewhere private and resumed the celebration with you in pajama pants, IF you felt up to it.\n\nThe bridal party is meant to be about sharing a special moment with your closest friends. The safety and comfort of all the guests should have been the primary concern.\n\nIm so sorry that you were treated that way. You did nothing wrong, because your *intent* was obviously not for what happened. Id be willing to bet you'd give just about anything for that to have not happened at all, let alone when a few hundred near-strangers were staring at you. Thats the bit that should matter - how you felt in that moment.\n\nAgain, I'm so sorry no one was there to support you in that moment. You did nothing wrong. Nothing. You couldn't have known.", "NTA and let me replace what happened with another medical issue. Would you still be embarrassed?! No? Good.then stop being \ud83d\ude33.  Health issues happen ,you have no control over them nor the timing. \n\nTime for you to find real friends who actually care about you not about a look on a day for a couple of hours.", "I wouldn\u2019t tease a friend about that.", "Especially when it\u2019s things people can\u2019t help and tried to avoid. I get it when it\u2019s like \u2018they wore a white wedding dress as a guest\u2019 or \u2018he proposed in the best man\u2019s speech\u2019 or \u2018they brought their forever-tantruming toddler to my child free wedding and they screamed through the ceremony\u2019 but oh no \u2018my guest was unintentionally sick and feels awful about it\u2019?! Grow the fuck up", "Truth.  If you want to minimize the chances of someone/something ruining your special day, elope with just the two of you.", "I think it\u2019s hard, because for a lot of people, weddings are a big money and time pit.  You put so much of your energy and resources into this one day which in turn makes it feel like a waste when it\u2019s not perfect. So, I get the stress people feel trying to force the day to be worth the spend. I don\u2019t condone acting like an asshole, but I get why they might.", "Was it orlistat?\n\nThat one in particular REALLY causes diarrhea. If it was, best to skip your dose on important days like weddings", "There\u2019s a podcast i recently listened to about this. Dax Shepard and Monica Padman have a series called Armchair Anonymous, where people call in and share whatever the theme is. This one in particular is Public Evacuation. It\u2019s amazing. I cried down the freeway, laughing so hard. Might help you feel less alone. \n\nNTA. You need better friends. This could\u2019ve been the medication, could\u2019ve been a touch of food poisoning, could\u2019ve been a slight virus. It could happen to any of us. If you were my friend, I would\u2019ve stopped everything to make sure you were okay. I would\u2019ve helped you figure out what to do next.", "Yes!! Some minor injuries, but he is back home safe and sound. He was gone for a couple of weeks!!", "Info: was your accident before you started down the aisle or in front of everyone? NAH if it was in front of everyone because even though it was not your fault and unpredictable, there would be no way it wasn\u2019t all anyone would remember about the wedding and I would be upset at the situation too.", "NTA.  You couldn\u2019t have known.  All medications have long lists of possible side effects.  You never know how your body is going to react.   I\u2019m very sorry this happened.", "I am sorry but your parenthesis make it still unclear... was it obvious? Or do you assume it was obvious because of your \"paranoia\"? Are we talking a pale pink skin-tight short cocktail dress? Or a black satin roomy floor length?\n\nTo be blunt: Was the bride aware at the time, and/or is she aware now, that you pooped yourself?? \n\nIf she JUST thinks you left and doesn't know the full reason why... she's still being petty but not a complete monster.", "I fully agree with you on that but no one can control a friend getting sick. That\u2019s just life. The bride not asking how her friend was doing is the AH. It was obviously traumatising enough for OP and no fault of her.", "It was in front of everyone unfortunately. And yeah, I'm not thrilled that's what everyone is going to remember either : /", "Every person at that wedding (and on planet earth) witnessing this would understand you could not have planned this, you could not have prevented this, and that as weird as it may have been for everyone else, it was especially mortifying for you. \n\nIt is really unfortunate Sarah chose to react the way she did. Had she acted with compassion and grace, this would have been a hilarious story about their wedding. Heck, Sarah could even have made a joke like \u201chere I was so worried about someone wearing a white dress to the wedding\u2026damn, girl, what did you do, run a marathon right before the ceremony?\u201d Because as horrifying as this was for everyone involved (you most of all) it was a very human thing and every single person has had moments their bodies have failed them, maybe not as publicly as you did, and understands if you could have prevented it from happening you would have.", "Ya then I can see why she is upset at the situation even if she rationally understands it\u2019s not your fault. I understand how upsetting and embarrassing this must also be for you, but I would let things sit for a while since it seems like from your post this happened less than a week ago.", "I reread your post twice and was trying to understand what exactly happened. I was thinking maybe you just abruptly left the ceremony to go to the restroom, but the guests could hear, or possibly see, the accident before you excused yourself?\n\nIf I was in the audience, and just say someone from the ceremony excuse themselves, I\u2019d be concerned for the person. Maybe think they were feeing nauseous or having anxiety. It would be insane to see someone poop themselves. \n\nI don\u2019t understand how a friend couldn\u2019t show sympathy either way. I\u2019m sorry you had to go through this, but it could be a great story for you someday.", "Oh you poor thing, no wonder you\u2019re so stressed out about it.\n\nI\u2019m sorry this happened to you, and I\u2019m even more sorry that your so-called friends don\u2019t seem to have any empathy or understanding for your unplanned medical issues.\n\nIn no way are you guilty of anything other than being a victim of prescription medication side effects and callous friends.\n\nNTA, and anyone who has the nerve to be mad at you over this is not a real friend."]}
