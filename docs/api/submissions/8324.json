You post things for attention and this is what attention gets you. You can\u2019t tell me you didn\u2019t think one of his exes, whom he has no choice but to interact with, would find some level of offense? She sucks for assuming everything is about her that you post. She has valid concerns too about her daughter and not wanting there to be any \u2018bad blood\u2019 and when you post vague content slandering exes, people will undoubtedly speculate. \n\nDoes the step daughter have a tik tok account and watch tik toks? It\u2019s worth having a conversation with her about your sense of humor and how it isn\u2019t a direct attack on her mom.

If so, why is he staying with you?", "How much of your content relies on having content that jokes about a fictional ex that your husband has?\n\nI don't think she's worried about random people seeing it but her child seeing it in the future and thinking it's about their mother. Also I'm sure your husband has other exes but I'm guessing the mother of his child is the most significant and one he still has to deal with.\n\n\nI'm not sure what my verdict is yet. I can see in certain situations where I can see her point and is it really that bad to drop my husband's ex is a shrew type jokes or whatever is negative in the best interest of your stepdaughter. I also can see situations where someone is over reacting and also why is she even looking at your stuff. \n\nI'm going with NAH for right now.", "Tiktok is dumb as shit so ya you're prob TA", "YTA for putting into the public sphere things that you know others will think are about her. \n\nAre you personally going to track everyone who sees the reel down and let them know it\u2019s not about her?

Especially if its about single life and so maybe also about meeting someone as a single person, if a friend saw that they could think that her step mum was dating someone spart from her dad which could start rumors at school.
