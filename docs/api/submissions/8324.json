She\u2019ll see her step mom shit talking (whether intentionally or not) her bio mom. I don\u2019t know how she reacts to that because I don\u2019t know her or your relationship dynamic. But I can\u2019t imagine how it ends well. If she laughs it off it becomes offensive to bio mom, as her own daughter is now justifying jokes at her expense. If she takes it serious then she ends up resenting you for shit talking about her bio mom. Either way, resentment will pop up somewhere.\n\nFinally, seriously, there are so, so many topics to joke about. Why is it so hard to avoid \u201chis ex\u201d jokes?
