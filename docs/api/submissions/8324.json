They will all think \u201cex wife.\u201d\n\nThey will also likely think \u201chis\u201d is referring to your husband.

No one wants to really admit they may have done something shitty, even accidentally. People will jump through all kinds of mental hoops to justify themselves so they don\u2019t have to feel bad about something they said or did that may have hurt someone else. And that is exactly what you\u2019re doing.\n\nYou\u2019re trying to justify it by saying it\u2019s not about her, he has more than 1 ex, she doesn\u2019t actually watch them and neither does your husband and step daughter, so it doesn\u2019t matter.\n\nAll ways to justify in your mind that you\u2019re not the bad guy.\n\nBut I\u2019m sorry, in this situation *you are the bad guy.*\n\nGiving you the benefit of the doubt that it isn\u2019t intentional, you need to stop lying to yourself and admit that your jokes can very easily be taken as being pot shots at your stepdaughter\u2019s mom.\n\nAlso, your step daughter will eventually get TikTok and probably see those videos when she\u2019s older. She\u2019ll see her step mom shit talking (whether intentionally or not) her bio mom. I don\u2019t know how she reacts to that because I don\u2019t know her or your relationship dynamic. But I can\u2019t imagine how it ends well. If she laughs it off it becomes offensive to bio mom, as her own daughter is now justifying jokes at her expense. If she takes it serious then she ends up resenting you for shit talking about her bio mom. Either way, resentment will pop up somewhere.\n\nFinally, seriously, there are so, so many topics to joke about. Why is it so hard to avoid \u201chis ex\u201d jokes? You really can\u2019t cut that out of your repertoire? Those jokes are *that essential* to your career?\n\nCome on.\n\nCut the ex jokes. Delete the old videos. No one is saying you have to stop doing what you do. No one is saying to stop being on social media or doing jokes.\n\nJust stop with the bullshit \u201chis ex\u201d jokes. Apologize to the ex. Tell her you didn\u2019t mean for the jokes to be about her, but now you can see how she and your fans may have thought they were and you\u2019re sorry.\n\n**That** is the grown up and mature way to handle this.", "Ew", "Wait this is your \u201cjob\u201d?", "She\u2019s absolutely too young to \u2018get them\u2019 but she is 100% absorbing them.
