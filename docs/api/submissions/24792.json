My wife and I agreed that her being a SAHM was worth it, and I can sustain the household on my income. I started to notice about a year in she was getting overwhelmed and asked what I could to help. She claimed to be fine, but I started to price around childcare options. Spoke with, friends, family, and colleagues looking for any suggestions, recommendations, and resources.

It is run in the same office building I work at, so it is super convenient I drop her off when I head to work and pick her up when I leave. Perfect! \n\nHere is where the issue arrives, my wife is not doing anything. We split the household chores. That is how it was in my family growing up and I find cleaning and cooking relaxing. So I am fine with it. That being said my wife has not done much with her day since our daughter started daycare. I understand adjustments take time, that being said the original agreement was for her to be a SAHM, with our daughter in daycare not being rude staying home to be a mom is not happening. I brought up the million-dollar question \"When are you going back to work?\" \n\nThis may have been a miscalculation on my part, but I figured I am in this deep let's see it to the end. She gave me a glare of death and tried to change the subject. I kindly interjected, not trying to push you but practically speaking I told her that she has no excuse to not be working. This was my tactical error she blew up. Thankfully, during this daughter was at my parent's house so she did hear or see the yelling. We went back and forth using the classic lines from both sides of the camp. She used the good husband provides the option for their wife to stay home. I said if you want to be then either watch our daughter or do the housework. Your being home is not a free pass to do nothing. She clapped back with your coworkers' wives get to stay home and do nothing. I told her I agree but they have cheated on their wives want me to start doing that? I am sure you piece together the rest.\n\nThe comment about cheating was not a threat, she was using the fact the wives of my coworkers get to be home even though their kids are also in daycare. I pointed out that the husbands are cheating on them. My coworkers' situation is skewed, they have found it is more beneficial to stay together from the wives' side. We live in a state where spousal support has caps and does not matter how many years you were married before. Husbands stick around cause the status quo is just easier.\n\nIt was just to state that is not the life she thinks it is.\n\nEdit: Please it was not meant as a threat, she had envy of other families she knows and wanted what they had. I just told her the truth about what was hiding behind their walls. It was not me saying I would cheat, just me saying the life she is envying is not all sunshine and rainbows. The wives she sees are paying a price that she was unaware of and I know she does not want to pay.\n\nShe was also a software engineer. \n\nShe was 100% on board, and I confirmed with her if she was okay with the daycare options, and if not that is perfectly okay. \n\nShe does not have any mental health issues I am aware of. I have suggested she does speak with her doctor but that is something she has to do, I cannot force her.\n\nShe did enjoy her line of work or at the very least that is what she told me. \n\nI also agree with the things said did not have to be said and that it was not a proper way to handle the situation. Just wanted to clarify that I have no intention or thought of cheating. It was simply a response to her asking why she cannot have what she sees my coworkers wives have.", "created_utc": 1692204616, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15sv7z8/aita_for_telling_my_wife_she_no_longer_has_an/", "score": 8633, "replies": ["Your post has been removed. \n\n#Do not repost this without [contacting the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) for approval, including edited versions.

He does most yard-work & takes out the trash each week. When we\u2019re both home childcare is 50/50. If your wife isn\u2019t working then the home should be her job.

So for the last 8 months she's just been sitting at home basically doing nothing? Are you sure she's not cheating? But you asked a valid question. If she wants to be a stay at home wife then she needs to do 100% of all the stay at home stuff since you're going to be the breadwinner. This doesn't mean you have to come home and cook and clean and take care of the child. She wants to go back to the 1950s then you get to make all the money and get to do the fun things with the kids. But you're not going to be able to save much money for college or retirement so she better get used to skimping. But yeah she needs to get out, get a full-time job and maybe you two can use the money she makes for college and vacations and then your money is used for the bills and retirement fund. I think that's a fair compromise but expecting you to support her the rest of your life while she does nothing or not much around the house, that's just wrong. Now if you make say 2-300,000 a year then obviously I would think you have enough money unless you live in a city and then that probably doesn't go as far.

This garbage that your coworkers wives stay home is exactly that. Different families do things differently. Perhaps they have different/misplaced priorities.

It's completely reasonable to suggest that you don't view your coworkers marriages as healthy, and using that as a point of comparison for your own marriage is problematic. Instead you set yourself up for failure by making an argument that could only elicit a negative response (Do you want me to cheat, or are you wrong?). \n\nThat's not arguing in good faith, that's setting her up to feel stupid. The best response you could have hoped for from her was her dropping her argument out of a feeling that you view her demands as absurd, rather than you two coming to some kind of middle ground. That's you framing things so you can feel vindicated at her expense. One walks away feeling \"right,\" while the other walks away feeling \"wrong.\" If you're trying to rebalancing things so the situation is fairer and you're both on the same page, that kind of zero sum argumentative style is a really bad idea.\n\nAs a partner in that relationship you deserve to feel cared for, as she does. That's the core problem here. It shouldn't be you looking at your wife and saying \"you're fucking up, stop it,\" it should be you saying \"I feel like I'm carrying things by myself and need some more help.\" You attack her, she's going to feel attacked, and hilarity will ensue.

She is being very lazy and you shouldn't have to be the only one doing stuff for her whilst she does almost nothing for you.

You broached the subject of her going back to work by essentially telling her to fix a deadline to find a job. Since it hasn't happened yet you accuse her of making excuses for not working and wasting her time. \n\nYou backed her into a corner, of course she'll say she's fine. She'd rather not have you telling her she is lazy and looking for excuses.

It is stressful being the sole provider, and she could be making money, helping you both have a better lifestyle, better savings, maybe even earlier retirement. All great stuff. Plus, the longer she stays out of work, the harder it is to go back. It's good for her own security and the security of the family for her to have income and good earning potential.

We can justify a secretary when I may work a hour maybe 2 a day taking care of that. So I am saving him from having to hire a person . Which would be $400 weekly. I also help with his parents which again saves us money from hiring someone again easily $400 weekly. Plus I do a the house work except outside yard work he does.\n\nSo by me staying home I am saving us roughly $3200 that we have to spend to hire others for what I would do. So I can justify me being a stay at home house wife.", "I think it's reasonable to at least expect the working spouse to do extremely basic stuff like bring your plate to the sink/dishwasher, put dirty clothes in the hamper, help if the non working spouse is doing a 2-person job like moving furniture, etc. Things that aren't really chores and don't take any real effort, that show a general respect of the other person's time/effort.", "Nah, she wants to be a freeloader. House wife implies that she does something around the house", "You guys hiring internationally? I'm a software engineer \ud83d\udc40", "Oh haha thank you", "That may be true, end of the day it use to point out the grass is not always greener on the other side. In the context of the situation and with the totality of the information that is not here one could see it was meant not as a threat but to establish that their lives are not ours so we should not compare. \n\nI get how it may seem like a threat at face value. My wife knows it was not a threat, and acknowledged the point and intent behind why I said it.", "Yes, I can see how it could be seen as a threat. I will say your framing is off this has nothing about me being satisfied by her. More so her actions, as a person she is still the same person I married and had a child with. \n\nOverall I think the concept of a SAHW is weird, and see no reason to limit the income of the household even if more than enough is already coming in. That being said, as mentioned if she wants to be home with our daughter then that is worth any cost. This was the original agreement, but the key factor is being home with our child. I had no problem splitting the chores, I enjoy cooking and cleaning. If she is going to be home then, something has to give but even then I do not think limiting potential household earnings is worth having one person do the household work. \n\nI also agree very view cons associated with having two incomes in the house it is a great way to manage risk. This is why I did suggest marriage counseling, hopefully, she is on board.", "My coworkers do it because they do not care, and know they will not leave them. Maintaining the image is all they care about. How is it a threat if have no intention to do it? Doesn't some form of intent need to be present? Also, it is relevant if that is the life she wants, then it comes with such complications. May be screwed up but a give and take is still provided they do not get to be home for nothing.\n\nEdit: It was more meant as there is always a catch.", "To be precise you said, \"Do you really sit down and make sure the chores are split 50/50 or you just perceive your share to be 50?\"\n\nWhich implies that they should be splitting the chores 50/50, which makes no sense because she has no other responsibilities which was the whole crux of my comment.", "I specifically mentioned it wasn\u2019t physically exhausting.  I said it was time consuming and requires constant attention.\n\nMy point is that there is less time to multitask than you would think.", "No, I\u2019m not understanding the relevance to her not doing shit all day while both OP and the child is gone with OP doing the drop off and pick ups. It\u2019s like you\u2019re trying to project your experience on her, but you\u2019re failing to realize that it\u2019s different situations **because she doesn\u2019t do anything**.", "I was not comparing it to everyone. She brought up how come my coworkers wives get to be home, and do nothing. I told her. How is that comparing it to everyone? Did I say everyone?", "I think it was more of a , \"Well, Sally doesn't work or do the chores, and Bill supports that...\", \"Yes, but Bill is also cheating...\" situation. You can't point out another relationship because you want one aspect without acknowledging the toxic parts.", "I\u2019m fairly certain he has more of a grasp on the lives of his coworkers than you do.", "I have to respectfully disagree. The concept of staying home even just doing chores is weird to me. We split the chores. Limiting a household income to one just seems dumb to me, why handicap our earnings so one person can be at home? \n\nAn argument can be made that she did the housework, but even then it imo it is not worth it. Now if she was spending this time with our child, then yeah that is priceless and I would gladly do whatever to maintain that. Which was the original agreement we both felt her being a SAHM was well worth it. Thing is, what is the point if she is not staying home with our child?", "Listen to her or she will bring it up with the relationship manager.", "HAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA, What a stupid comment", "\ud83d\ude02 completely delusional", "Are you a clown because you got major jokes", "Stupidest post of the day award goes to...", "I get you, my husband and I both work but I used to also do the majority of the chores. We had an argument where he accused me of not doing enough, so I stopped doing ANYTHING for a week - my god the mess within a few days was a distraction! But it did prove my point!", "I don't think I'd bother doing that.  It will only delay things temporarily and this will keep coming up again.  \n\nI'd just give your wife the three options - she works, she takes over the housework, or you take your daughter out of daycare and she does the childcare.  \n\nIt's simply not fair to you that you work a full time job and also have to do 50% of the cleaning.  It doesn't take 40 hours a week to do the cooking and cleaning, so if she took that option, she'd still have tons of free time.  All you should have to do is clean up after yourself and not create more mess and she should handle the rest.  \n\nSide question that doesn't really matter but I'm curious - do your cheating coworkers really do 50% of the cooking and cleaning?  I'd be really skeptical of that.", "When you find that answer, please let me know. Because you and I are of a like mind.", "\nI like cooking, but I have adhd and find prepping and planning stressful.  So my wife will plan and prep the meal, and I get to do the fun part.\n\nI\u2019m sure you know that when you cook you can clean as you go and it makes a huge difference with minimal effort.\n\nAfter the meal I expect her to clean it up what remains. If I go down for breakfast the following morning and the mess is there I remind her she needs to clean up the kitchen.  (Obviously I use context her too like does she have the flu etc).\n\nSet boundaries and expectations.", "Only if they are. It\u2019s not fair to be a SAHP and be responsible for 100% of the house as well. \n\nI\u2019m 43/f a SAHP and always have been. My 46/m husband has always provided 100% financially, but helps with the kids and house. \n\nIt\u2019s more my responsibility, but he always helps and he just does, I don\u2019t have to fight.", "Look, you two obviously need some serious couple's therapy that you aren't going to get out of an AITA post on reddit. You're probably going to \"Win\" here, but that won't do anything for your relationship and I promise showing her this if you win, which I hope isn't your intent, is not going to help you out in your relationship at all.\n\n You might not have meant anything by it, but you're having a serious fight with your wife and she says she wants to be more like X person, and you say X person gets cheated on. How is she supposed to take it? You say you meant it as \"There's always a catch\". Well, what will the catch be for her? If that catch is something less bad, rather then bringing up the cheating at all you should just have this discussion about that.", "Didn't mean in that way. I mean it more like \"Are you on the same page about the amount of chores you do?\" And \"does she actually expects you to do 50?\". \nSorry if I didn't Say it the best way, i'm not really good at English", "My question was - what kind of job should she have then ?  Not that she shouldn\u2019t but with more kids at some point working full time would not be ideal. I don\u2019t think she should stay home either, but what does he expect ? Part time ? That\u2019s fine.  It\u2019s not mentioned", "Do they do nothing? Is that what you hear from their husbands? Staying at home comes with responsibilities. Communicate with your wife.", "The issue is that he's projecting their lives on his own. He needs to communicate with his wife about her wants and needs as well as expectations.", "I agree with stay at home parent but in this case OP\u2019s kid goes to daycare so his wife is home alone all day.", "Oh absolutely right here. I mean I think one common thing people do is look at it like both people are at work those 8 hours. If the children are down for a nap it's time to clean and do house work, if they're watching a show it's time to pick up or vacuum another room, basically any chore or household tasks should be done, but then once the spouse is home, duties are back to split.\n\nIn my personal opinion I don't believe it should necessarily be split 50:50 because while yes children can be absolutely draining plenty of days, as someone who has both stayed home with children and been the full time sole supporter of my household before, being the full time supporter of the house hold is substantially more stressful and wears on you more and requires more to recoup. That could simply be my experience with it though as I do absolutely love children which might make it seem less like a stressful activity whereas even at the best of jobs I haven't loved it loved it. Not to discount that financial dependence comes with stress too.", "That\u2019s literally what she first did. His counter was to say their lives are like that because their husbands are cheating on them and the wives don\u2019t want to get divorced.", "If his wife wants to stay home, there ARE expectations and responsibilities. Period. How does OP know exactly what his coworkers wives do at home? Does he spend all day there with them? Doubtful. So he's hearing it from their husbands. His arguing about this honestly sounds like what they want in life doesn't align. She has more traditional values than he does. Neither is wrong, but communication is key.\nEdit: there ARE expectations***", "What your saying is that is she wants to stay home there should be any expectation about her doing anything? If it was truly traditional values, she would be handling most of the house work. \n\nBut she isn\u2019t. OP is. And yes, there should be some expectation that some housework would get done considering she doesn\u2019t have the child or a job.", "No I said there ARE expectations. Cleaning, household chores, etc. She could even work from home. Argue away. Communication is key, period.", "Listen. You're arguing against yourself at this point. I literally have said over and over that if she wants to stay home, she needs to take care of the home. Period. It's not a free ride. Hence why they need to communicate. At this point, OP sounds like a huge asshole. It's my opinion on a sub ASKING if he's the asshole. If they want two different things in life, they aren't compatible. It's that simple. If she doesn't want to clean or lift a finger, boot her ass to the curb. But there NEEDS TO BE COMMUNICATION.", "I swear you edited that to say No expectations at first because I read it multiple times. Communication is key that why he was communicating with his wife on when  she possibly would go back to work. Then the conversation could\u2019ve further evolved into other shit.", "I agreed communicate is key. That why I said he tired to communicate but it was received well. Similarly, to yours stating your opinion. I can disagree with your opinion and state why I disagree with a part or all of it. Reddit is an open forum and idea will be challenged."]}
