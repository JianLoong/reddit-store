I thought I\u2019d finally make my first post.\n\nI (21F) am a university student in the US. My inner circle of friends have decided that we want to take a trip for our spring break as it is our last year of university and we\u2019ll all be moving away from each other come May. A part of my family is Greek and my uncle owns a small hotel near Athens (only 3 story, very small rooms, more budget friendly style of traveling). Anyone who has been to smaller hotels throughout parts of Europe would know what I\u2019m talking about, but I do not know immediate English translation for it. So, I spoke with my uncle who graciously invited my friends and I to come to Athens and stay for the week without expense of staying, just have to pay for our flights/activities.\n\nInitially this was just me and 3 other girls who I invited and we all were very excited and already booked tickets in the summer time. But in the past 3 months, we have become friends with 2 other girls who have slowly joined our group and I extended the invite to them, one being Harper (22F). At first Harper was excited to come and liked the thought of not paying for the hotel, but when I showed her pictures of my uncle\u2019s hotel, she became very passive-aggressive with me. In these kinds of hotels, the only way to get to rooms is basically lots and lots of stairs. Even the location of the hotel is very hilly so lots of walking is required. And the elevator is very classic European elevator where one standard sized person will fit, but they are mainly used for just luggage. Harper is plus sized and has chronic pains so she said she would not be able to take the stairs since she cannot fit in the elevator.\n\nI found out from my other friend later that Harper is talking behind my back calling me names and saying I\u2019m only inviting her to let her be humiliated and how inconsiderate I am for planning a trip with poor accommodations. Immediately I called her to ask why she says this about me and she was blaming my uncle\u2019s business because the hotel not being accessible is a form of fatphobia and ableism. I tried to explain that many of these kinds of hotels are very old architecture and standard in European travel, especially in Greece. Then she went on to say that I shouldn\u2019t be defending such a \u201cdisgusting culture if that is the standard\u201d. I honestly do not know how to proceed, and I am thinking maybe there is a cultural misunderstanding? Some of my friends are saying to just apologize but disinvite her altogether if she is taking such issue with it. AITA?\n\nEnglish is not my first language, so if you need more clarity please ask in comment.", "created_utc": 1698032915, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17ebghi/aita_for_defending_my_family_against_claims_of/", "score": 214, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Im from Europe and these old buildings were built years ago. I stayed in Sorrento Italy one summer and the lift was a death trap, you walked up the stairs.

It's your uncle's hotel where you and your friends can get free accommodation, you didn't pick a hotel where there weren't any stairs to single out Harper.

What I do find, is that people are quite gracious, friendly, and helpful if I politely ask for assistance if needed. \n\nI find Harper's attitude to be ungracious, ungrateful, selfish, rude, and entitled. I mean sometimes I miss out on things too but it's not that big of a deal in the big picture - the world doesn't revolve around me because I'm in a chair!

Better to cut her out before you face more crap like this", "Nta, your uncle\u2019s offer is very generous but obviously Harper is very narrow minded. Not every business needs to change everything to accommodate xxl people.

Should we demolish all churches and castles and houses and villages and streets and buildings that are hundreds of years old and not accessible, so bigger americans dont feel discriminated against bc they can not access them? Ofc it would be great if everything everywhere was accessible for everyone but thats not how life works, especially not with old architecture. She would probably also complain about the urban planning (europeans walk and in many cities that includes steep hills) and that ancient ruins and buildings were not planned with disabilities in mind. It would not be a fun trip with her, I think.", "NTA - Pretty ironic that she used the phrase \"a disgusting culture if this is standard\" considering most other countries hold this opinion of the US and it's obesity epidemic", "NTA. I am a frequent visitor to Athens - and have lived there. I am very familiar with the hotels you describe. I also use crutches to walk, which unfortunately means I carry more weight than I\u2019d like. \n\nWhilst I\u2019d love more places to be truly accessible, it\u2019s been an ongoing joke for me and friends there for years that I always have to negotiate stairs of death to reach facilities as they always seems to be up/downstairs and are usually steep/spiral, etc. \n\nBut. Many places were built a long time ago. It\u2019s not feasible for updates/adjustments to be made. It just is, what it is. What I would say is that whilst they might not have the infrastructure that exists in the US (I presume) or the UK, the Greek people will do everything they can to help and try to help with access. \n\nHarper needs to learn that unfortunately, she won\u2019t be able to do everything, all the time. Yes, it sucks, but it\u2019s a fact of life. Especially if dealing with a chronic condition. (I wonder if her pain would improve if she lost weight as you don\u2019t mention a medical condition.) \n\nHer defeatist attitude sucks. And if I was you I\u2019d disinvite her. She will make the entire trip about her and what she can\u2019t do - rather than trying and thinking of ways to partake. Which even in Greece - with the limitations of the landscape and infrastructure is possible. I did a tour of the Peloponnese a few years ago - including Olympus and Monemvasia - with the help of some friends. It was tough. But I did it - with adaptations. E.g. when I got to Monemvasia, whilst I could get into the old town. I couldn\u2019t get all the way up. So, found a nice bar instead and chilled whilst friends went exploring. \n\nGo, hope you have a wonderful time, and make some brilliant memories!", "But what does Harper want?\n\nShould your uncle rebuild his hotel to accommodate her needs? Should you find another uncle out of thin air, who owns a bigger hotel?\n\nAt this point I would tell her that something came up and there is only room for the other guests, and I would point her to another hotel in the area that is more suitable to her needs.\n\nShe\u2019s welcome to pay for a bigger hotel if this is a priority to her.\n\nAbsolutely NTA, and she is being a r/choosingbeggars/.\n\nI would gladly sleep on a bed that I don\u2019t have to pay for.", "NTA and make sure she knows she\u2019s uninvited", "NTA\n\nInstead og enquiring about ways to cope with her problems she immediately picks up the am victim flag.\n\nFrankly tell her she is nolonger your friend and to only interact with you professionaly.\n\nIf not, tell her to do her own research and see if there are any hotels she can be comfortably accommodated too. Don't do it for her, she unavailed herelf to your help with her actions.\n\nAlso make it clear to her the hotels were booked before she even came into the picture so unless she can prove you're clairvoiyant or became friends with her maliciously, tell her to shut her ahole.", "NTA. Harper\u2019s weight is not your problem, she can\u2019t go out the stairs well tough on her. Anyone who has the slightest clue about Europe knows that the architecture is very different. The fact that she has the audacity to complain, talk badly about you, and disrespect your uncle when he has kindly allowed you all to stay in his hotel, without paying is unbelievable. Speaks a lot to her character, or lack there of. Just disinvite her, she will clearly be an absolute pain the whole time that you all are over there, I don\u2019t think any of you would end up enjoying the experience with her constantly complaining.", "NTA - time for Harper to learn everything isn\u2019t about her.", "1) don't apologise, you did nothing wrong. This is just \"weeeeh I'm fat accommodate me\"\n2) the moment she went behind your back she stopped being a friend. She's a vindictive AH.\n3) I'm fat, I have pain too. I live in Scotland so yeah there's loads of places that have loads of stairs and I accept that really old buildings have really old accessibility. I still go in them and climb the damned stairs and if I can't for any reason, I don't go.\n\nYou are NTA but ditch that friend. Its another COUNTRY of course things will be different.", "NTA.

And ouija boards are always an option to get an answers from the past.\n\nWe (humans) all got larger - weirdly enough none of are ancestors saw that coming and therefore didn\u2019t build their dwellings to our modern accessible standards.

Harper is an AH. Uninvite, you need not apologize for anything, it's not like YOU'RE the one that built the hotel. Also, in most European countries (in my experience) stairs and physical activity isn't an issue, just like obesity in those countries aren't an issue either. I am American, I am not 600 lbs but I am considered overweight for my height and age, am I complaining? NO, what am I doing? Exercise and eating better. Can't be mad that you're fat if you don't put the fork down and do something about it. No one can help you but you. Now, I understand a lot of people do struggle because of medical reasons, in which my statement/opinion doesn't apply to them. HOWEVER on the flip side of that coin, if it is medically a struggle, you CAN talk to doctors and TRY to help yourself. Harper needs to get real.", "NTA Harper isn't a friend. Ditch her and her entitlement. How dare she blame Europe for her lack of being able to exercise!", "NTA at all. So, she's \"sensitive\" to \"fat phobia\" and \"ableism\", yet she's happy to be outright racist towards an entire continent... the mind boggles...\n\nYou and your uncle have been super generous and to find fault in that makes me feel uneasy. Also to add, your uncle has an independent business in an historical building. It's not on him to change his own building to suit someone else's lifestyle *choices*. Because that's what this is... it's a lifestyle choice. She could do something about her weight (which would also help with her \"pains\") but she makes everything out to be everyone else's fault.\n\nAthens is the birthplace of the Olympics. The Mediterranean diet is also very healthy. If she wants to come on your trip, she is welcome to pay tribute towards the Olympics and the Greek diet by exercising more and eating healthier, which would give her a large weight loss by the time the trip arises- and she would find getting around the hotel easier also.\n\nFor your own self respect, just uninvite her from both the trip and your life. Life is too short to allow disrespect and drama into it.\n\nEnjoy your trip, safe travels and don't indulge in the My Big Fat Greek American Tourist movie.", "NTA and I hope you rescind Harper's invitation.

There is only one hotel within 40 miles of the village where my mother grew up and the building is 200 years old. Now that my dad is a wheelchair user, he can't visit my mom's hometown with her because there's nowhere for him to stay and no way for him to even travel from point A to point B in her village.

But if you want to stay friends, to some degree you should try to have compassion for the fact that she feels humiliated and probably super disappointed.", "NTA.

Lived in Romania and to get to my friends apartment I had to use an old soviet era lift where you manually close the door and grill. It was small and you'd worry about someone overweight using it. There's no use in complaining because it won't change anything. Op should just uninvite Harper and use the excuse that the relationship with uncle is more important.", "NTA. I thought it was nice, and inclusive, of you to invite her.  If she doesn\u2019t want to go, she doesn\u2019t have to. Sounds like she\u2019s disappointed that she would be uncomfortable on this trip and instead of dealing with that personal issue, is choosing to project that onto you and literally all of Europe. It\u2019s understandable for her to be disappointed and not want to be left out. But it\u2019s not you who\u2019s leaving her out. You literally invited her after knowing her for only a short time; which is the opposite of excluding. \n\nIt\u2019s a \u201cher\u201d problem.

Harper is just honestly overplaying the victim card here. That or she vastly misunderstands the world outside the US.\n\nWhen I think of (what sounds like) bed and breakfast places in Europe, the way you described your uncle's place is the first thing that comes to mind (both with and without the elevator) because that is just part of the centuries old (and extremely charming) architecture. \n\nI'd disinvite her and if she keeps having issues over it then I'd reevaluate her friendship. A friend who is basically insulting you and your family for something that has been around since well before anyone's GRANDPARENTS is not a friend I think you'd want.\n\n(Fun fact: the only time I got to go on a trip out of the US was with my parents when a friend of of theirs dropped out of the trip to Bermuda so my view of the world is limited...I wonder if Harper has left her home state much less the US)", "i know who is not joining the trip or the friend group.

When we were planning Italy, my mom planned around her knee surgery and the pain and capabilities she would have.", "You're absolutely NTA.  You'd booked it before you even knew her so it's completely unrealistic of her to expect you to change any of the plans.  Her criticism of this type of holiday is also ridiculous.  If she chooses to blame everyone else for her lack of fitness she will never make any personal progress.", "NTA.  I'm fat and have dodgy knees.  I'd be stoked to be offered a free hotel in Greece!   I'd have to work out whether I could manage it, but that would be my issue, not yours.\n\nYour \"friend\" is insane, and has Main Character Syndrome.", "NTA. She's a drama queen who wants attention. She might be in poor health, but she shouldn't have made this situation to be only about her health.

During one trip a tornado came through the area and the power was out when I arrived.  My room was on the fourth floor.  I cursed at my suitcase and laptop bag as I climbed the stairs.  I\u2019m pretty sure it wasn\u2019t the hotel\u2019s fault.", "NTA. Harper has singled herself out by making these comments. You did not extend the invitation with any meanness in mind let alone considering humiliation. The hotel is three storeys high not fifteen and yes, the stairs may be narrow and steep but that is how older buildings are. However you are likely to be doing a lot of walking around Athens when sightseeing so Harper may also find that difficult to cope with. I suggest you say you are sorry that the hotel isn't able to meet her needs and that it is not a matter of disrespect but that is what is on offer for a free stay and there aren't any free alternatives so you are sorry she won't be able to join you. \n\nStairs are indeed a pain for those of us who are overweight and have (probably as a consequence) knee pain/arthritis. It doesn't stop me from taking the stairs in preference to the lift (exercise is a good thing) where possible. I might be slower than others and \"dot and carry one\" on the stairs but that is my problem (I also hate lifts unless necessary).", "NTA\n\nYes the accommodation not being accessible sucks, and I get that your friend is likely lashing out because she needs accommodations and it can be so very hard being taken seriously with the double whammy of chronic pain and being plus sized. People can be so mean, and if you're over a certain weight can be so lazy about providing help they would give to a non-plus sized person because of crappy 'Oh you're fat it's your fault' thinking.\n\nThat said, she is absolutely acting like an AH by making the problem all about you. You didn't make an inaccessible hotel. You didn't plan to stay there just to exclude her. I'm sure if she was around before planning started you would all have made plans that allowed for her access needs. Even now, if she hadn't gone from 0-100 I'm sure your group would have considered a change, or at least helped her find her own suitable accommodation and discussed how you can all make sure she isn't left out on the trip. You can still choose to do that, but honestly it sounds like disinviting her might be the lesser of two evils, since she's going to be pissy and grumpy whatever happens.", "lol\n\nI mean...no. NTA.\n\nFat traveller here. I get the anxiety around unknowns. I have stayed at hotels just like you describe. One time I was on the 5th floor with no lift at all.  But I certainly never asked them to....demolish a building and rebuild it. \n\nDitch her. She is going to shit all over your trip with her negativity.", "NTA.

You were not defending a fatphobic or ableist.

What are the realistic solutions? Having your uncle refurbish his hostal on his budget to keep free accommodation for you and your friends and increase the rating for future, paying, customers with physical challenges? (Meanwhile during reconstruction having limited accommodation capacity.) You and your friends changing accommodations? That would increase your budget, for every one of you, not to let Harper being discriminated.\n\nI can understand Harper's frustration. She needs special accommodations and that excludes her from enjoying a normal life and she doesn't want to feel excluded from the things he friends can enjoy.

She embodies the negative entitled woke stereotype [I'm using the word \u201cwoke\u201d with caution as I understand the original and positive meaning of the word]. She tacitly demands that everybody else make unreasonable accommodations for her. Instead of asking if there is a bottom floor room for her, she decides to trash you and your uncle's hostal. Instead of promoting a constructive dialog for solutions, she promotes a bad environment. I can think of many possible solutions, at least some of them viable, for Harper to come with you and you all enjoy your vacations. But I see no point in presenting then given the attitude she showed. It seems that whatever you do she will blame you. In that case, you'd better cut her as your friend.", "NTA.

I thought I\u2019d finally make my first post.\n\nI (21F) am a university student in the US. My inner circle of friends have decided that we want to take a trip for our spring break as it is our last year of university and we\u2019ll all be moving away from each other come May. A part of my family is Greek and my uncle owns a small hotel near Athens (only 3 story, very small rooms, more budget friendly style of traveling). Anyone who has been to smaller hotels throughout parts of Europe would know what I\u2019m talking about, but I do not know immediate English translation for it. So, I spoke with my uncle who graciously invited my friends and I to come to Athens and stay for the week without expense of staying, just have to pay for our flights/activities.\n\nInitially this was just me and 3 other girls who I invited and we all were very excited and already booked tickets in the summer time. But in the past 3 months, we have become friends with 2 other girls who have slowly joined our group and I extended the invite to them, one being Harper (22F). At first Harper was excited to come and liked the thought of not paying for the hotel, but when I showed her pictures of my uncle\u2019s hotel, she became very passive-aggressive with me. In these kinds of hotels, the only way to get to rooms is basically lots and lots of stairs. Even the location of the hotel is very hilly so lots of walking is required. And the elevator is very classic European elevator where one standard sized person will fit, but they are mainly used for just luggage. Harper is plus sized and has chronic pains so she said she would not be able to take the stairs since she cannot fit in the elevator.\n\nI found out from my other friend later that Harper is talking behind my back calling me names and saying I\u2019m only inviting her to let her be humiliated and how inconsiderate I am for planning a trip with poor accommodations. Immediately I called her to ask why she says this about me and she was blaming my uncle\u2019s business because the hotel not being accessible is a form of fatphobia and ableism. I tried to explain that many of these kinds of hotels are very old architecture and standard in European travel, especially in Greece. Then she went on to say that I shouldn\u2019t be defending such a \u201cdisgusting culture if that is the standard\u201d. I honestly do not know how to proceed, and I am thinking maybe there is a cultural misunderstanding? Some of my friends are saying to just apologize but disinvite her altogether if she is taking such issue with it. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "Sorry, can't she walk? Does she have a medical condition that does not allow her to use the stairs? If not, then your so-called friend is acting entitled. Just leave her ungrateful, whiny a** behind and enjoy your vacation with your saner friends. Edit to say NTA.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t build the building and chances are people weren\u2019t as far as they are today back when it was built. Sounds like Harper is projecting and you wouldn\u2019t be TA if you uninvited her. \n\nTechnically she has plenty of time to lose weight and build up some endurance before the trip", "She isn\u2019t being excluded; she can book elsewhere if the accommodations don\u2019t suit her needs. \n\nIs she an American? The conflict between access and history is something a lot of Americans don\u2019t get. It isn\u2019t an either/or; it\u2019s \u201chow can we provide access without destroying the historical value or making the project prohibitively expensive?\u201d Until new solutions are found, some older places\u2014and natural places\u2014will be inaccessible. If every effort is made to disallow that as a petty excuse, then it\u2019s just what it is.\n\nYou don\u2019t have unlimited free access to other hotels. Hard to believe she doesn\u2019t get this. She actually does and is probably trying to bully you into helping pay for her trip.", "NTA. Ahh this brings back fond memories of my euro trip, lugging my suitcase up several flights of stairs in hostels. It was a fun experience. It was not just Greece either, Austria, and croatia, too.\n\nIt's free accommodation, if she ain't happy about it then she can find accomodation else where, good luck to her.\n\nIf she's upset about the stairs, wait until she hears about the toilet and sewerage system there.", "NTA! You will usually not find elevators in buildings with three floors or less...", "NTA. Heather doesn\u2019t have to come or she can chose her own accommodation.", "NTA\n\n1. The group should tell Harper that she is no longer invited to join in the group trip. (Honestly, it sounds like she would complain about pretty much every. single. thing. the group would want to do.)\n2. Even separate from the group, it would be completely reasonable to tell Harper that she is not invited to stay at your uncle's hotel. No one gets to enjoy your family's hospitality after insulting and complaining about what they are offering.\n3. Harper is going to find the vast majority of the world is \"fat phobic\" because most of the world has structures that we built long ago, that don't have a lot of space, and that were built on land that isn't level. Good luck to her getting the world to expend its scarce resources making sure she travel with ease. (And I'm a fat, overweight, out-of-shape old woman who has travels and knows it's up to me to find my own solutions and bow out of things I cannot safely do - like hike up a mountain.)\n4. Oh yeah. A lot of the world is also not designed for really tall people (like my 6'7\" husband). Tiny cars where his head brushes the ceiling, bathtubs where he has to bend to fit in, and beds that his legs hang off of. Some things can and should be changed (like the legroom on commercial planes); but not everything can fit every person.", "NTA BUT I hope you showed her pictures before any flights were booked - because plus size people can walk a lot and do many flights. I have. But if she has chronic pain, that\u2019s a different story and maybe should have been told (again assuming she saw this AFTER she booked tickets). But no, it\u2019s old architecture- what does she expect, that Greece shift everything for her?", "I'm a fat European and have chronic back pain, Harper is a c*unt. She's invited for a free stay, not a mandatory work trip. It could have gone so many other ways: asking if anyone would help her with luggage/stairs, getting strong anti-inflammatory prescribed (patches work wonders for my back, which I mostly use, you guessed it, when I'm travelling).

She would just book a different hotel.", "N.T.A. to the best of my understanding, most older buildings\nIn Europe,  are best left unaltered to maintain their structural integrity.( Aside from upkeep and reinforcement) it's hardly the owners fault that the hotel itself is antiquated and does not follow a modern standard.

Athens isn't \nExactly famous for its flat valleys and it is not like the locals can do much to make the hills and ancient stairs less steep. \nThis trip was already planned long before she came to mind and was never intended to make her feel specifically  singled out", "NTA\n\nharper is ignorant af not understanding how old some of these places are and that they are unable to be retrofitted with a lot of things that have become standard.

Maybe she should just stay home.", "NTA tell her she can't come, not got a problem if someone chooses to be fat, but when they complain that things aren't catered to them then it's an issue.

Same goes for a lot of European cities, they\u2019re build on top of each other, not a lot of space to remodel anything to fit current standards of accessibility unless whole housing blocks are taken down to do so", "The building I work in (and this is in Ontario Canada) is well over 100yrs old, there is no elevator (4 floors) and would be an undue hardship to put one in, there have been several architects/engineers say it would be impossible short of tearing down the whole building, which is a designated historical building. Basically, yes, some buildings are impossible to remodel. I can imagine this is even truer of centuries old buildings in Europe. I know in the UK certain designated buildings have VERY strict rules about how and when you can remodel, even down to using the same techniques and tools used when the building was originally erected.", "Well, we clearly should absolutely ruin old buildings with remodelling....", "Buildings are inanimate objects, and therefore can not be discriminatory. Only people can be abelist.", "It\u2019s always funny when the one that\u2019s upset tells others to \u2018stay pressed\u2019. People with disabilities can just not\u2026 stay in that hotel. Nobody needs to cater to obese people, shouldn\u2019t have to get a lift cos they couldn\u2019t put down the knife and fork. Easy as this, lose weight", "I been at NY around 2010-15 and I didn\u2019t notice anything different about the people around. But here isa big chance that I didn\u2019t pay enough attention at the moment.\nBut this is not a good future for the population health : (", "I think the UK has the highest obesity rate in Europe, so I'm not sure we should be included in this!", "NYC is still pretty thin for the most part.  That has more to do with being a dense, walkable city with good public transit.  You'll find most cities that fit that description also have fewer fat people than commuter/suburban dominated ones.\n\nIt comes down to TDEE.  When your commuting and errands have you walking 2-4 extra miles on a daily basis compared to a suburb resident who's using a car; that's ~300 calories, and walking <5 miles usually doesn't impact appetite all that much..  Add that up over weeks/months/years and it means smaller waistlines overall for city dwellers.", "Oof, what a pity. But yeah, accessibility definitely was only really considered for *much* newer buildings.", "Architecture is not just an inanimate object, it\u2019s also a discipline / practice which involves architects and city planners (the people who make and approve of the designs). The buildings don\u2019t just spring up fully formed without human intervention."]}
