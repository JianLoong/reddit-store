I don't think she should have had access to withdraw from the fund in the first place but I guess it was set up in her name and could be withdrawn from at 18?\n\nThe money was set aside school not just for whatever she wanted. I think the rest should stay for school only she's lost the privilege of unrestricted access to the account.", "I'm going to say NTA yet but you're getting really, really close.\n\nSo first off letting her intermingle her own savings into the college account and have direct access to it was your mistake. You should never have allowed either of those to happen and the fact that you did is now greatly complicating things.\n\nPersonally I think you need to calm down and try to have a rational discussion with your daughter. She's almost 18 now and if you fuck this up then it's going to have massive repercussions for your relationship with her down the line. Yes, she screwed up but that's no reason to utterly destroy your relationship with her.\n\nI think the sensible thing to do here would be to keep the lock on the college fund account so that you and your wife can control the disbursement of funds, and help her open her own account that is completely independent from you so that she can start to manage her own savings. Then the three of you need to sit down and have a rational discussion about what her college fund will and will not be used to pay for when she goes to college to set expectations. I don't know exactly how much money is in the account but it sounds to me like she's spent the \"entertainment\" portion of her college fund already and so while the college fund can be used to cover essentials in the future (tuition, books, groceries, rent etc.) there won't be any excess \"fun money\" in it.", "I\u2019d be upset too, but wouldn\u2019t lose site of the overall goal that she go to college and use what\u2019s left exclusively for that purpose. Set up the account where you (distribute the funds) are paying for room/board, tuition ,etc from there and that\u2019s it. When it\u2019s gone, she\u2019s now responsible for the loan or whatever. This life lesson will be learned outside the classroom for her.", "You put the money into the fund to send your daughter to college, not to some fan convention in Australia.\n\nNow you are making sure that that money doesn't help send your daughter to college.\n\nIf this is your way of getting your daughter to college, it stinks.\n\nI can't help but note that you (the responsible adult) didn't set up the account with the withdrawal protections that you could have. You should have been wise enough to know that a 17 year old with free access to that big of a pile of cash shouldn't have access to it without any limits. (That in no way excuses your daughter, but it does mean that you should have had more foresight into the folly that teens can do.)\n\nMIL is putting herself in where she isn't needed. She needs to understand that it isn't about dollars, its about being responsible. \n\nNTA for *telling* your daughter that she isn't getting the money. But you would be a real idiot if you followed through with that to the extend of emptying the account, depriving yourself of the option to change your mind when you cool down and are looking at a high school graduate who needs a job.", "INFO: why did she have access to it in the first place? And given that she did have access, why not set up protections for withdrawal/usage?", "i don't think you should take the rest of her college fund away from its originally intended use, but it's good that it's locked down now (she never should've been able to access it).\n\nif she only really took 5k because the rest was what she put into it, you should get that much from her trip refunded and tell her she can come up with the rest because that money is for her education. if you just let her use what she took and go to the convention and her dream vacation, she still gets what she wants.", "ESH her college fund should not have been accessible to her, and her savings should have been kept separate and accessible. She\u2019s immature because she\u2019s young. Don\u2019t be immature and take away her college fund to add insult to injury. But DO make the rest of it inaccessible to withdrawals except for college. Lesson learned. For everyone.", "NTA, but also don't go full nuclear. We were all dumb kids at one point. 10k is a LOT, dont get me wrong. But it's really 5k, 5k is hers as you said. I agree with locking the account. But I would not take it away entirely. Let her go, but just know she's out 5k unless she's willing to pay that back, in which case, goes right back to her so it's in her best interest to do that. Maybe I'm being too nice about it too. I dunno, I think it's extreme to take her education away over a stupid teenager decision. Do whatever you think is best. But no, you're NTA, you have every right to be upset with her about it.", "I\u2019d be upset but would just lock the account and tell her go and have fun but the rest of the money is for college. $5k was her own money, and you can chalk the other $5k up to a graduation gift.

Let her have this one thing that you know she loves.", "It sounds like a community fund that multiple people have deposited into including your daughter, sorry but YTA you are more focused on controlling your now adult daughter and this is one of the last ways you can. So you are.\n\nThis is how you permanently damage relationships, hell I caught my parents off for less until the day they died. Tread carefully", "Yes. Let her use what money remains for college. If she has to borrow, she has to borrow. If she\u2019s old enough to make decisions about how she\u2019s going to spend that money\u2014 however poorly you think she decided, don\u2019t jeopardize her future over a fan-girl pissing match. Besides, cancelling would\u2019 t mean she\u2019d get the money for airfare etc. back. The money has been spent.", "INFO: How did she have access to those funds, especially as still legally a minor?", "Why the fuck did you give a 17 year old access to that kind of money??", "I know the Australian dollar is low at the moment, but your daughter is going to find that Australia is a very expensive country. I hope she has access to spending money because I'd imagine most of that 10,000 has gone on fares and hotels.", "ESH.\n\nWhat she did was irresponsible.   You clearly said no and she clearly went around you to use her college fund anyway.  Both are also entirely predictable and to be expected from a teenager.  Consider yourself lucky that she is rebelling by being a fan and not a baby mama.\n\nAs for the college fund, you can certainly keep your position but clarify. \"Say goodbye\" means she has lost access. The remainder of the college fund will not be accessible to her, and you will pay for college directly from it.  This ensures that the funds are not further wasted, but avoids discouraging her from going to college.\n\nAs for teaching her that she can pay her way out of messes, that is actual life so I'm not sure what the problem is.  Paying it back means working and earning $5000 at least to pay the half that wasn't hers.  That seems like enough of a life lesson.", ">My wife thinks I'm being harsh and that she's right - she put at least 5k into the account herself, so she really only took 5k (which my mother in law has since said she'll pay back). I think this just teaches her she can pay her way out of messes.\n\nI see. So instead of any sort of repayment schedule where she puts the money back into the fund, you'll just fuck over her future by withholding all of her college fund? You'll show her whose boss by making her take out student loans that burden and drain her for the next thirty years even though it's completely unnecessary? And that's only if your draconian response doesn't push her to forgo college entirely. Is that good fathering?\n\nYou're teaching her that there is no point to trying to make good on anything she might have done wrong. After all, there's a perfectly reasonable way out of this, and you're going nuclear for no good reason. \n\nIf she was never supposed to have any discretion in use of the funds, then why the fuck give her access in the first place? You could have just paid the tuition to the college directly!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYTA YTA YTA\n\nYou're being way too unreasonably harsh.

She put in **AT LEAST** 5K, so it could be a lot more. You don't actually know.\n\nSecondly, \n> Claims she still has enough for college and this is a once in a lifetime experience.\n\n> I believe this has shown her extreme immaturity and inability to manage her futute and money. \n\nIt clearly seems like she has shown ability to manage her money and future. You haven't shown anything, or even told us that you *checked* to see if she was right about having enough for college. You just lost it on your daughter.\n\nThere's especially different costs for different colleges and a TON of different options for things she can do with college that have a massive range of cost for them.\n\nOnce in a life time trips & opportunities are just that - once in a life time. Sometimes you miss them, but sometimes you've saved over 5K and you want to use it to take those chances.\n\nHonestly this reads a lot more like you are upset she subverted your control rather than it being about the money. Did she have to pick a certain career path to use all the money? What happened if she went to community college and had 15K left over afterwards?\n\nYou didn't even try to understand whether your daughter actually planned out her future or how the finances would work, you just \"lost it\".", "NTA.. if you simply mean the account is locked as in she can only use it for college expenses.\n\nY T A if you mean the money is now not to be used even on college expenses.\n\nOh, incidentally, if this is a 529 account, using it on non-college expenses means you pay taxes on it...", "ESH, gently. \n\nYou've gone over the top with your 'cutting her off' reaction. You're mad she touched her college funds so you took *everything* away. The reaction to blowing $5k is to remove college options from her completely?\n\nShe has only taken $5k - but still shouldn't have. She's said she'll pay it back, and as for paying her way out of a mess - it was money she took, so it needs to be replaced with money.\n\nI'd keep it locked for now and not give her further access, but this convention is a big deal to her, and those people don't come to Oz, so I can see why she's excited. \n\nIf she's managed at 17 to save more than $5k then she's clearly not an idiot anyway, she's responsible enough to have done that, so you need to take some time to cool down and have a calm chat with her. Let her know you're upset but that you trust her to pay back the extra that she took.", "Alright, so 5k of it was hers.

If that's what you've told her, what you've told everyone that donated funds, etc. then you need to abide by it.\n\nYou're not going to like how she spends every penny she ever has.

I'm the first to say that parents are overprotective of their kids today, but this is a HUGE trip your child is about to undertake and all you care about is the money she took from her college fund.\n\nRight now I'd be concerned that she knows how to take care of herself on this trip to stay safe, what to do in an emergency, where to get help, etc. Then, when she returns and tempers have cooled, you can discuss and decide what to do about the money. \n\nThe trip could be a wonderful learning experience for her, especially if you talk to her, do some research and make plans before she leaves. Throw in some educational stops, museums or some such, to make up for how it all started. It could really enrich her view of the world and her college experience. No, she absolutely DID NOT go about it the right way, but maybe you all could make lemons out of lemonade. \n\nI'd like to mention that the Supernatural fandom seems like a good one.

If it\u2019s more of a pattern with her of being entitled and irresponsible, that\u2019s a different story.", "Nah, the OP can pay the college fees from that money directly, the kid shouldn\u2019t have access at all and doesn\u2019t need access for the money to go towards college.", "Yep he can pay college tuition and fees directly and she can be responsible for everything else, use her savings or get a part time job for spending money.", "I got the impression that OP just locked out daughters access and ability to withdraw from the account,  not that he closed the account entirely. Now any money being taken out is only taken out by OP.", "You can pay your way out of money trouble though. It's the one kind of trouble you can always pay your way out of. She was legally allowed to access this money even though there was some conflict over what should be done with it. About half of what she used was what she put in. She also announced her intention to spend the money, so it's not like she snuck around and stole it. \n\nI do think OP is failing to understand why this is so important to his daughter. He doesn't mention any previous pattern of frivolous, unannounced, or secretive spending. She's a huge fan of the show and wants to take a trip to a place she may only get to see once in her life. I wonder if OP would feel differently if this were a trip that didn't involve a Supernatural convention. Maybe a tour of Europe like the trips a lot of kids take after graduating?", "One additional point for OP to consider: he\u2019s not the only person who deposited money into that account. *He* does not have any right to withhold money donated by other people for the daughter\u2019s college costs. He\u2019s being an A-H to everyone else who put money into that account - including his wife.", "She put her own money into the account as well. I'd like to hear the daughters side.", "Why are y'all ignoring the fact that the daughter put in ***five thousand dollars of her own money, at 17 years old***?\n\nHow much money have y'all saved by 17? Hmm? What did she sacrifice to have that much of her own money saved up?\n\nAnd just how much money in that account were from family members? It seems at least another $5k was from this 17 year old's grandmother.", "As I understand it the daughter put $5K of her own $$ in and that should be included in what she took out.\n\nAlso a number of other people besides OP contributed so OP should not be making the unilateral decision \"no school for you.\"\n\nDaughter's friend should pay back the other $5K because she is getting the trip for free (a $5K value).\n\nAgreed that preventing a child from getting educated is a fool move, and that OP needs to make sure that's what it is being used for. But his kneejerk reaction without even discussing it with his wife is not the way to go.", "It just says only he has access to the account now. I assume he will still pay her tuition. She just can\u2019t use it for whatever now.", "Op is though. It sounds like he didn\u2019t discuss this with his wife. He made the decision.", "I don\u2019t think this is real. It doesn\u2019t make sense. The minor wouldn\u2019t be able to pull money out of a college fund. Source - this is my job.", "What about the money that she contributed, family contributed and other gifts? That is up for her to spend as she pleases.", "Well if it isn\u2019t the consequences of the daughters actions. NTA", "The thing is MIL is likely one of the donators, so them having a say on money invested is a thing too. Mother as well. \n\nIt\u2019s not all just OP donating here after all, he\u2019s just the only one who apparently has oversight on it.", "A job for a year might be what the high school graduate needs.  Right now his daughter sounds like she doesn't really want to do college.  Give her a year or two of a minimum wage job and trying to pay her bills and she might come to realize the value of a college education.", "Better than question is why wasn\u2019t it in a specialized college savings account with better interest rates.", "This is the one I want answered. It either wasn\u2019t in an actual college savings plan or something is fishy.", "Until OP answers this YTA", "That\u2019s not necessarily possible though. Have her pay back the remaining 5k? Sure. But don\u2019t ruin her trip by forcing a refund for half of it. Forcing the refund may mean the entire trip is ruined EVEN IF SHE COMES UP WITH THE MONEY because conventions like that sell out regularly, flights fill up, prices change, etc. Everything is already locked in, so it would be better to set up a mandatory repayment plan with her in exchange for allowing her to go on the trip and a talk about what she did/why it wasn\u2019t great.", "This is the comment I\u2019ve been looking for. Daughter is immature because she\u2019s young but still old enough to recognize $10k is a ton of money which is why she went behind dad\u2019s back. What I\u2019m really confused by is why this money wasn\u2019t put into a 529 or similar, depending on country. That comes with withdrawal penalties and taxes, one, but is an asset of the parents and can\u2019t be touched for non-qualified expenses without consequences. It makes me think this money has just been sitting in a regular savings account all this time which, yikes. Maybe I\u2019m an ass for saying this but it seems like bad money management all around.", "Did you mean ESH for everybody sucks here?\n\nETA isn't a ruling on this sub.", "This right here.", ">Maybe I'm being too nice about it\n\nNo, I think you've got it right.  She can pay back the $5,000 or just be out $5,000 for college, and if what's left isn't enough, she'll have to take a loan for what she needs.\n\nHonestly, I don't even think the trip is that stupid.  If she can afford a trip to Australia (by paying her $5K and repaying the other $5K over time) for 2 weeks with a girlfriend to explore the country and see this convention, that actually sounds pretty awesome.  Is it indulgent and wasteful?  Sure, but she's got her whole life to be a wage slave, and you're only young once.  (I say this as a 47-year-old.)", "The kid managed to save 5k and wanted to put it away for college. That\u2019s a pretty large chunk of change for a teenager. So I would say that she does want to focus on her future and go to college. But she\u2019s also a teenager who sees an opportunity to do a really amazing fun experience and did something stupid when her dad said no. To punish your kid by making it very difficult for them to get a good education seems more childish then being like hey now there\u2019s some rules on the money like I\u2019ll pay tuition and rent but you don\u2019t get free access to it.", "Yes, this. All of the N T A are blowing my mind. This person sounds unhinged. She's a kid and she's excited about doing something. She sounds pretty responsible overall. And for him to say that he just gets to control all of it and disregard what anyone else who has contributed over the years is just icing on the AH cake. \n\nYTA.", "This, exactly. YTA, OP. She\u2019s very right that this could be a once in a lifetime trip for her, you never know when a group or celebrity will stop doing appearances for a show, and Supernatural is getting to be \u201cold\u201d now by media standards. Besides, a travel opportunity like that is a major life experience and can be a huge benefit towards developing a solid worldview that isn\u2019t just limited to your country/regional cultural experiences.\n\nLet her go on the trip. Don\u2019t take away her entire future (college fund). College debt can really screw people over. It sounds like she\u2019s pretty responsible to have saved up $5k on her own by 17. I\u2019d honestly trust her to pay back the rest even if MIL wasn\u2019t stepping in.", "Exactly. Let her see she now has to borrow money to finish college. She wouldn\u2019t make four years with $10,000 anyway. It\u2019s not like a trip to Australia isn\u2019t of educational value either.", "Yeah, the people screaming **LUXURY VACATION** are out of their fooking minds. It's 3K just for plane tickets.", "Sooooo expensive\u2026. It\u2019s a bit hectic\u2026", "Right? Like yes, you absolutely can pay your way out of messes if the mess is that you owe someone money! Paying is the *ideal* way to fix that kind of mess!\n\nBorrow your buddy's car and crash it? Apologize and buy them a new car; mess solved. Spill red wine on your best friend's new coat? Apologize and buy them a new coat; mess solved! \n\nNot every mess can be solved by throwing money at it.

Why did she have access to this money to begin with?  So she would put HER money in it.  But you are angry she wanted her money because used for something she thinks is important", "I agree... She was allowed to put her own funds into it and was given full access... I really don't think it's entirely on her for thinking of it as her own savings rather than a college fund given that's how it was treated to begin with.\n\nIf she knew she wouldn't be allowed to use it she probably would not have put her own savings into it to begin with.\n\nEspecially because he says \"at least 5k\" so he actually has no idea. It could be 10k or even more.\n\nI find it ridiculous to punish her so harshly over her \"\"\"stealing\"\"\" an undefined amount of money from 0 to 5k from an account they willingly gave her access to even if they called it a college fund.\n\nI do think it makes sense to lock it to ensure she doesn't splurge further but they also need to look into how much of it is her own savings and return that to her. If it's less than 10k then I think it's reasonable to make her par back the difference.\n\nBut it's pretty ridiculous IMHO to basically deny her access to money she had earned which is OP's stance on it.\n\nWhat if she decided she doesn't want to go to college, would parents just take her savings for themselves?\n\nI don't like her behavior of just taking it after being denied either but this whole situation was set up to be messy.", "She's 17 and already applying to colleges. She would have access to that money soon anyways. If this convention were to happen next year, she probably would've done the same thing.\n\nThe issue is that she couldn't control her impulses and spent $10,000 on a vacation that she couldn't afford. $10,000 is not a small amount of money. OP has every right to be pissed that she not only took that money out secretly, but spent it on a luxury when that money was specifically designated for something else. Locking her out was the correct decision. I would probably have her submit all school related expenses and pay them directly until that fund runs now, since she showed that she can't be trusted with the responsibility.", "JFC thank you, I thought I was losing it with the other top comments acting like the **the revenge of the millennial** is totally cool\n\nOP is absolutely YTA\n\nIf everyone else close to them recognizes and agrees that this is overblown;  I think it's quite obvious that OP, most of all, likes control and to be respected no matter how wrong he is\n\nAnd that's not love and care.

If she's 17, she's graduating soon and that comes with a celebration, which I'm pretty certain this is going to be (and she will never forgive you if you sour this and neither will your wife, bet)\n\nSo now to punish her you take away the good prospects?

Parents do not *need* to provide a college fund for their children, but it definitely is looked upon and a nice thing to do.

If she fixes this mistake then just let it go.\n\nNAH\n\nETA: I think you must not be a fan of the show (I am). The show is extremely meaningful to the fans (and I suspect she has not told you how much this show actually means to her, not *really*), and she is right, it is a once in a lifetime opportunity to meet Jared and Jensen. Yes she may have made a bad judgement call but she *is* still young.", "Pull out only your contributions, and don't make any future contributions.", "NTA \n\nThat said you need to ask yourself what your goals are long term. Do you care if she goes to college honestly? If you don\u2019t and only saved it to give her the opportunity to get ahead should she choose to? then keep it. If you absolutely care wether or not she goes you\u2019re cutting off your nose to spite your face. Now I\u2019m not saying let her get off scott free, far from it. You could tell her that you\u2019re only willing to let her access the fund if she cancels the trip, and returns what\u2019s able to be returned after cancellation fees. Oh and with receipts to prove the amounts. It\u2019s likely that what was yours will be returned, and what was hers will have been lost. There\u2019s a big lesson there, she needs some consequence or this behavior will only get worse. It\u2019s not about fixing what was wronged, it\u2019s about her learning to not only never do it again. To realize that she can\u2019t intentionally do bad things, cry mercy, then get bailed out. \n\nAnother option is you could also tell her that the only way you\u2019ll consider giving her access is if she repays the 10k with interest. Not only that but pays for it herself BEFORE she starts school and accesses a cent of the fund. No mommy and grand mommy bailing her out by giving her the money, she needs to work for it. They\u2019ll say who returns the money doesn\u2019t matter, but it does. The money isn\u2019t the issue.. the issue is the lying, the stealing, keeping secrets, and manipulating. I\u2019ll also tell you now that if you fold on this and just let them do whatever without any kind of boundaries or punishments moving forward your issue is only going to get worse. As of now she\u2019s of the mentality that the can intentionally do bad things then bait and switch to guilt you when you react to her bad behavior. This isn\u2019t some young girl who accidentally crashed her car, or forgot to switch her card back as default while buying something on amazon. This was not a mistake. This was premeditated and well thought out. \n\nShe had multiple opportunities to change her mind. While she was looking up flights, while she was reserving the room, how about when she was buying the tickets? or the flights? She made the decision to do this over and over and over again. It wasn\u2019t a temporary moment of insanity. If you can\u2019t bring yourself to risk her not going (if you think that setting rules for it like repaying or cancelling will cause her to just forfeit going even then) than the only other punishments I could see would be taking away her car away (for I don\u2019t know 3 months?) whatever it is it has to be large enough to have a a day to day impact. As far as you wife you need to walk her through the fact that this isn\u2019t about money, this about lying and stealing. She could\u2019ve taken out $500 dollars, and/or she could have taken x out, changed her mind, put it all back and you\u2019d all be in the same predicament. it\u2019s not about the amount that\u2019s missing, it\u2019s that she stole it. \n\nGiving it back when you\u2019re caught doesn\u2019t mean you didn\u2019t steal, that\u2019s not a loan that\u2019s a crime. It also doesn\u2019t matter that she put in 5k. If you give someone money then take it back without permission it\u2019s still stealing, it was no longer their money. Tell you wife that she and MIL need to stop promising to pay it back. That if the moneys going to come from anyone it\u2019s going to be her, it\u2019s a matter of principle. You should talk to MIL directly and tell her that this is an issue between you, your wife, and your daughter. That you love and respect her but it\u2019s not her place to get involved or try to shield your daughter from the consequences of her actions. Primarily when they\u2019re not accidental, they were extremely premeditated. If your daughter was even half way mature she would\u2019ve told you she was going to withdrawal the 5k she put towards the fund, and gone with that. She didn\u2019t need to fund her girlfriends half of the trip. If it cost 10k for everything, it would\u2019ve been 5k alone for her half. \n\nHell if her girlfriend couldn\u2019t have afforded it she could have come to you and her mom and asked you for a loan and promised to pay it with interest. She didn\u2019t though, because she\u2019s a child. She couldn\u2019t take the risk of doing it the right way and you maybe saying no. She was behaving entitled and selfish. Children or people in general that think like that don\u2019t ever get better on their own, they get worse. The more they behave that way without intervention and real life consequences the worse those behaviors become and the more common. Because they know they\u2019ll be shielded from the consequences, eventually they start to feel entitled to whomever and whatever they want whenever they want. It already sounds like she\u2019s dangerously teetering that line. Regardless of what you do I wish you the best, I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re in this predicament. I hope you\u2019re able to find a resolution that appeases you and makes her be continuously reminded of said decision and what it cost her. I hope she comes to her senses as well as the rest.

I\u2019m not even sure OP is actually mad about the money itself, but the fact that she found a way to go.  OP was aware enough to acknowledge that by the time the trip rolls around she\u2019d be 18 and could go if she wanted to, so withholding money is the only real way to stop her. \n\nAnyway, all this to say I agree with you but I don\u2019t think OP will just let the daughter go.  Honestly, I think if OP had been really concerned about the money, he should\u2019ve listened to daughter and *help* her instead.

Everyone saying \u201cfor a convention\u201d is missing the part where OP mentioned she\u2019d go for a few weeks and the convention is only part of the trip as a whole.  This clearly means something to daughter and OP would\u2019ve been better off supporting her and being involved. That would\u2019ve also mitigated the impact on the college fund.

I know that if I had free access to that money, I absolutely would have spent it on something stupid", "On the other hand, parents should be off kids savings accounts when they turn 14, so they can't dip into whatever the kid hasvput in there.", ">Not all kids are idiots, but some are impulsive to a fault. OP, hold onto that money and tell her when she enrolls in college, you'll pay for it.\n\nI'm glad my parents weren't like some of these comments saying the kid shouldn't have access to the money. My mom made a college fund for me and my brother and we had full access to the money, but we never did what OP's daughter did. The only time touched the money was for emergencies.\n\nBlanket statements \"don't trust kids\" should be more about \"teach your kids to be trustworthy around money\" because I've known way more kids with access to money not do that, but the ones that do are easy to cast a bad light on others.\n\nI agree OP at this point should have the sole access to withdrawals. Let people have the chance to prove their trust, don't just assume they're untrustworthy, especially when it's your kids. OP's daughter proved she can't be trusted with it.", "I totally agree with you. I also love your mindset when it's comes to how you're raising your son. I've always been the same way and just spent money when it was needed, not so much on leisure since I don't go out so much, and repaid everyone I borrowed money from. \n\nI think a lot of people in the comments aren't thinking about the effects of the decision of taking the college fund away and how that would affect her. Personally I agree with you and think that she should just repay the other 5k that she took out and leave it at that. No need to go overboard.", "Also, I can tell you, SPN conventions are a HUGE grift.  I loved the show for years but would never go to cons because I could never justify paying thousands of dollars for autographs or 2 minute photo ops.  Creation's whole business model is ripping off fans.  It's shameful, really, but the actors justify it by saying the fans seem to have fun.  But the whole thing is kind of a weird send-up to parasocial relationships.  Idk.  I've always hated it.", "To a Supernatural convention???  It's not like she's touring world cultural sites.", "Other things to consider: the \"other end of the country\" for Australia is not a big deal, there's like six major cities in the whole country with regular flights between them, and booked in advance it's maybe $400 USD return. Con tickets as well won't break the bank.\n\nHow often are the two main cast members of the series going to be at a con together, for a series that ended three years ago? Probably less frequently over time, especially as they move on to other work. In the same country as the girlfriend? Trust me, celebrities don't come all the way down here for cons very often.\n\nTo be honest, I could wax lyrical about the benefits of Australia versus the US. Unless I've misread OP here:\n\n> They have both wanted to go to a convention for years - at least five that I can remember. \n\n..is that five conventions, or five years? Five years of a long-distance relationship is insanely solid especially for the emotional, floaty time of a teenager. That takes effort. And now they want to share what won't be a once-in-a-lifetime but certainly few-in-a-lifetime experience together, something they both love...\n\nYou squeeze too hard and they'll slip out. For one thing, she gets off the plane in Australia and every dollar she has is now worth almost twice as much. Australian schools do not have the American dangers. (You know the ones...) Healthcare is public. Loans for education are not privatised and the repayments are only taken from your salary when you earn over a threshold. And while the country's behind on LGBT issues in a lot of ways, we certainly aren't experiencing the right-wing pushback that's hitting the US.\n\nFrankly, OP oughta be worried that those two weeks give her a taste of the lucky country and she doesn't want to come back.", "And is taking a vacation for several WEEKS.

There's ALWAYS a supernatural convention.", "But why is it such a big deal if mil was willing to gift her the replacement money? That sure as hell sounds like mil (aka family) was gifting the other $5k to her since it was a special situation.\n\nIf op is the only one pissed about it, why does he get to trample all over the family member actually paying the money the daughter didn't contribute to the account. I'd agree if the whole family was mad but it just seems like oop is trying to control her finances instead of having a mature adult talk and teach her something responsible like having her get a job to pay the money back. The insistence that op is right regardless of what everyone else involved saying they're ok with it just shows that whether he realizes it or not, op is just using money to control her.", "Oh don\u2019t worry, we\u2019re experiencing the same right wing misinformation/conspiracy theories in Australia that the US is dealing with.

Those were not college contributions unless specifically stated.", "It's not clear that the gift contributions were specific gifts to that fund. Dad wants them to be seen that way to support his story. They could easily have been cash gifts to her that someone chose to deposit into the college fund.\n\nHe completely f*cked up by not helping her plan the trip. Guess whose ticket the daughter would not have paid for (and is likely never getting paid back for buying)? The friend. She's been wanting to do this for FIVE YEARS and, honestly, it seems it's not breaking any banks. If dad had supported this effort, the funds would not have disappeared from the college fund and he would be acting like a fool.", "Same! My parents had 18 years to save and just, didn't. If I had kids, which I probably won't, I'd do everything to give them a leg up in this world.", "OP was so against her going on the trip despite if the daughter was to pay for it.

Some credit cards will also allow you to set spending limits on certain categories by day/week/month, and make you go through additional steps to make a purchase that exceeds those limits, or at least alert you that a purchase blows your budget.\n\nWith these kinds of tools, once you buckle down and think about your budget once, you are prompted when you need to think about it again.
