He has a daughter (12) with his deceased wife. When I first met Jeff it was obvious that he was struggling as a single parent. For my stepdaughter's birthday he'd usually get a cake from the bakery. This has been the case since her mom passed away. I thought I'd bake her a birthday cake for her 12th birthday that was last week as a gesture to show some motherly love and support. Jeff agreed and he told me what his daughter's favorite flavors are and what she likes and so on. I baked the cake in the flavor she likes and the icing she likes but one thing was missing and that is the blueberries and I couldn't include them because I went to the nearest store and they didn't have them. I was running out of time and couldn't get them so I ended up just leaving the cake as it thinking it wouldn't be a big deal.\n\n\nThe party started and Jeff was busy taking care of everything else. He then came into the kitchen and asked to see the cake before bringing it out. I showed it to him and he got so angry when he saw that there were no blueberries on top. He went on and on about how I didn't fully commit to making the cake and that he trusted me to take care of it and just basically saying that he should've just ordered one from the bakery. We got into an argument and he ended up taking it and throwing it in the trashcan. I was stunned as he said \"you know what? Forget it, I'll get one from the bakery\". I blew up and screamed at him, he told me to stop but I went upstairs, got dressed and left. He tried getting me to stay but I refused and went to my parents'.\n\nHe later called and then texted about how I overreacted and hurt him and my stepdaughter by leaving. Also said that I created this situation by not \"properly\" making the birthday cake just cause I didn't put blueberries on top. I refused to respond but my parents say he was justified since he must've felt pressured from the stress of making his daughter happy on her birthday.\n\nHe keeps trying to speak to me but I don't respond. AITA? did I overreact?", "created_utc": 1699298145, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17pahyg/aita_for_leaving_my_stepdaughters_birthday_party/", "score": 5416, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Has he had explosive reactions like this in the past, because that's kind of scary. If he reacts this way over missing blueberries, what happens when something *really* goes wrong?", "NTA\n\nYou went out of your way to research what kind of care your stepdaughter would want, put in the effort to bake a cake (after agreeing with the dad on you baking the cake) and baked a lovely birthday cake. It was just missing one kind of deco because you couldn't source it in time. He went nuclear and threw out your cake?!?! Yeah I wouldn't have stayed around after that either. It is a childish, vindictive, aggressive, and hurtful way to deal with what he saw as a less than perfect situation. He seems extremely overprotective of his daughter. She's 12 and would probably love this cake even if it didn't have blueberries. Even if she had noticed and said something, she could have been told the shop ran out, and at her age she should be able to understand that and lean to deal with that kind of 'disappointment'.\n\nAre you pushed aside in other parenting situations too? How is your relationship with your stepdaughter?\n\nIt's only been a year and he already treats you like this? I'd reconsider this marriage.", "\\> said that I created this situation by not \"properly\" making the birthday cake just cause I didn't put blueberries on top.\n\n\\> AITA?\n\nNo he did not appreciate your time, efforts, concern and love for his daughter, and literally, threw it away. Then blamed you, for that and shamed you for being upset and leaving.\n\nDoes he think it would have been fun, for you *or* for anyone else, if you had been forced to stay, while crying, at a kid's birthday party? (After his tantrum upset you, and if he had succeeded in forcing you to stay.) Even from his (seems to me) *selfish* point of view, how would that be *good*. (For his daughter, either. With that tension hanging in the air? Caused by him, though. Or his glaring at you, throughout, had you stayed?)\n\nYou were justified leaving. Did he think of his daughter really, when he did that? I can't see how she would've said \"yeah, throw out my bday cake.\"\n\n\\> my parents say he was justified since he must've felt pressured from the stress of making his daughter happy on her birthday.\n\nNo wonder you are not sure if your feelings are valid.\n\nThey are. NTA.", "He is already verbally abusing you, humiliating you, and treating you like shit after only a year? His behavior is completely insane.

This is not going to get better.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Even *if* blueberries held some really special meaning for your stepdaughter (like they were her mom's favorite or something), 1. he should've expressed this to you beforehand and 2. still should never have lost his mind if you couldn't find them.\n\nThere is something really wrong with your husband if missing blueberries sent him into such a tailspin. If you decide to stay with him (and this red flag is so massive, that's a big *if*), I would make therapy mandatory.", "NTA.\n\nLife is too short and precious to live like this. There are 8+ billion people on this earth. I 100% guarantee you that you will find someone who treat you better than this. Treasure yourself. Best of luck OP.", "Husband clearly overreacted. Throwing out a cake because of blueberries? He\u2019s a bit too old for such tantrums isn\u2019t he. \n\nOne thing thing baffles me though. Your parents choose his side. What are we missing?", "NTA. Your husband is a walking red flag. Don't ignore it.", "NTA\n\nLeave this marriage IMMEDIATELY \nNext you\u2019ll get a slap for overcooking the roast!\nTo throw away an entire home made cake is rude and disrespectful. \n\nAnd can we just address your parents HORRIBLE excuse to justify his behavior \u2026what the actual fuck is wrong with them????

If the cake was remarkably wrong, he could get upset and ask how this happened, and even say he now has to go to the store and get a new cake, be a bit moody about it, and then later have a discussion about where the mixup happened (why did you make chocolate when we said vanilla) and then express why the cake is so important, everyone moves on. Even in this scenario, screaming at you and throwing out the cake is a disgusting reaction and you had every right to leave. \n\nThis is a cake, and mistake about it -big or small- is no reason for an aggressive and abusive response. Of course just not having blueberries on the top is a very small thing, and even if those blueberries held the most sacred meaning, what your husband did was gross. \n\nHE overreacted, HE ruined his daughter's birthday, HE drove you out of the home. There is no justification for getting angry and throwing out the cake. Do not let him or your parents make this your problem, and there is no stress justification that makes what he did understandable.", "NTA. He says you overreacted? Jesus. This guy sounds like a real winner. Is he always such an asshole?", "NTA. GIRL RUN.", "NTA, and holy overreaction Batman. I wouldn't be returning without a serious apology and maybe a commitment to therapy. This sounds like some serious anger management issues on his part.", "He thinks that *you* overreacted?! A grown ass man threw away a perfectly good cake because it was missing a few berries and he thinks *you\u2019re* overreacting? That\u2019s rich. \n\nOP, you did nothing wrong, and your parents do not have your back. NTA, and if anyone- including your stepdaughter- asks why you left the party, you tell the truth.", "NTA.  Jeff is abusive and now you know that.", "NTA\n\nThis is a hard time of year to get fresh blueberries to begin with, the US harvest has ended, and the South American harvest is just beginning. \n\nYou committed to baking this cake, the blueberries are just decoration. He completely dismissed all your other work that went into baking this cake because you couldn't find blueberries.  This man is not worth your efforts in the future.", "NTA\n\nHe seems to have some major red flags that need to be dealt with.  Why is he so upset about the blueberries?  Could it be that he was triggered and remebered that his wife always made it a specific way and so he always ordered it from the bakery in a specific way?  I think if the blueberries were THAT important he should have stressed this to you prior so that you could've gone to a different grocery store to source them out.\n\nI don't think it's fair to your stepdaughter that she was thrown in the middle of this, how is your relationship with her?  Has she made any comments regarding the cake or was she just upset about the fact that you weren't there?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think your partner could benefit from starting therapy and working through his emotions in a healthier way", "NTA. Instead of blowing up like a red flag maybe he could\u2019ve popped to the shop and bought some blueberries instead of going to the bakery? He treated you in a disgusting manner.", "NTA. He could have gone and bought blueberries. Especially if he was going to the bakery. You really deserve better than this man.", "NTA\u2026 and holy hell, don\u2019t ignore this red flag. Also, don\u2019t let him try to emotionally manipulate you by playing the widower card in some way.
