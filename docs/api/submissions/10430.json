Even with you situation atm (I\u2019m very sorry and I hope everything goes well for you) that\u2019s just straight up rude and he needed to hear that. As someone in the south as well some people are just a little too comfortable letting crap fly out and you need to set them straight so good for you hun", "NTA. He made fully unnecessary comments about your body. What you put in your cart is your business. He can F off.", "NTA at all. He made a stupid comment and rightly got dressed down. Is cursing in front of kids great? No but it was well deserved in this case. On a side note, look into food donation centers in your city. Churches and other organizations will usually let you pick up donated food on either a bi weekly or monthly basis. Yes you have a job but they take your income vs your household bills in account and will provide some basics..meat, bread (a lot of that), canned fruits and veg. Pasta and grains. Please don't let your ego get in the way of asking for help. Food donation centers are here for a reason and will gladly give you what they can. Good luck, op :)", "NTA, that was also a lesson his kids got, you open your mouth about someone else\u2019s business especially if you are rude then you get to deal with the consequences. You aren\u2019t obligated to be nice when someone is being rude, the kids hear cursing I\u2019m sure all the time in the south if their upbringing was like mine.", "NTA, I probably would've told the kids that their dad is a judgemental jackass so your reaction was not the worse he could've gotten lol", "NTA\nHe didn't know you and could have potentially triggered you if you had anorexia or other EDs. He also had no business butting in, maybe you just wanted a light snack because you had a dinner with family later, or maybe you could've been getting it for someone else. In short...there could've been a million reasons you weren't buying alot. It was not his place to assume.\n\n\nGood for you putting your foot down.", "NTA.", "Nta people should mind their own busses at the store, its not a social club!\n\nI have had many normal interactions with people this is just silly.

What you said is exactly the feedback he needed to hear. I wouldn't feel bad about it. He shouldn't be commenting on other people's purchases.

That being rude to other people has consequences.", "NTA", "100% NTA. Who cares if kids were there. That comment was \u2018a first punch\u2019 you have every right to defend yourself. Hold your head up high.", "NTA. It is WRONG to act that way in a store. He's grown. He has no idea what you're living through, and plenty of people are barely scraping by anymore. It's one thing to be genuinely concerned about somebody when you see that they barely filled a cart. Calling someone \"anorexic\" as an intended insult and then acting shocked when someone snaps at you is childish af.\n\nPs: I hope it gets better. Have you tried applying for food stamps?\n\nAlso, I know it will probably be extremely uncomfortable, but churches do also usually have food banks.

He had zero right to be rude and you were 100% in the right for putting his (way too comfortable to but in someone else's business), ass back in his place! \nIdgaf if someone is straight or not or if someone is green with yellow pokadots!!!.. rude is rude.. period... and I'm all about being a defender! Be proud of yourself for NOT taking his straight up abuse... \n\nAlso, side note, as a mom to a child that is gay, I low key am pissed at your family for not supporting you and doing the bare minimum to protect you.. idc how old you are.. my son is 25, almost 26.. and this momma will still lose it over someone being rude to him!!!! Idc what gender, sexual orientation, race etc.. all I've ever wanted and instill in my 6 kids, (25-15) is that I want them to be 100% happy, healthy and treated the way the deserve to be treated by whomever they end up with... the only catch is they have to give their partner the same respect.. it's a 2 way street...", "Perfectly said!", "Exactly!

Okay, but be prepared to be told you are wrong!", "He was rude, yes, but honestly, if I were in your shoes, I would have just replied with the truth: \"I can't afford it.\" Then he would have felt bad for being rude and there's a slight chance he would have bought you some meat.
