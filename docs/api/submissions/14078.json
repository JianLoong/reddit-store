Yall have to gradually get the dog to wait later and later until a reasonable time.\n\nAlso, that was a bad idea from the get-go. BF should have been taking him out before bed.

Take your dog to dog training classes, making somebody get out of bed at 3am for this isn\u2019t cool especially when you\u2019re the one that conditioned the dog to expect a walk at 3am.

It would be one thing if your bf was not taking the dog out and she had to relieve herself at 3am, but this is a whole other problem that you created unfortunately. Dogs are creatures of habit and thrive on routines. \n\nYou're gonna have to figure out how to condition this nighttime ritual out of her. My thought would be to take her out for longer walks than usual before you go to bed (say if you typically do 15-20 min, do 45 min) to tire her out.

I go through this with my husband. My damn dog can tell time. He gets fed twice and my husband travels a lot. If it\u2019s just me he wakes me up at 7:10. If my husband is at home he gets pushed with the wet nose at 5am. It ticks him off but I said if he just ignored him and told him no like I did a couple of nights he would wait. Your dog will too. Ignore her and tell her no until a new time is established. \n\nMy dog also changes when he asks for lunch. If I\u2019m on the couch he bugs me at exactly 11:50.

Do this consistently and she will get used to the new schedule.", "Sooo just to address what I haven\u2019t seen addressed here: \n\nyour last walk of the night is at 8 pm???? And you expect the dog to not have to go out again until the morning??? That is an unrealistic schedule for most dogs, unless you are walking him again at like 4-5 am.

I do a walk in the morning around 8:30 or 9, another one around 6, and then a final one around 11pm. Gives him plenty of opportunity to get his outside time.

His anger at you is justified, but helping the dog establish a new routine is a problem that\u2019s going to take both of you to fix. You probably should do the bulk of the work, but he doesn\u2019t get to sit around and do nothing. \n\nIf the dog whining at 3AM bothers him so much, he can do something to actually resolve the situation instead of just ignoring it until you fix it; to me, that feels somewhat passive aggressive and isn\u2019t constructive or helpful, and honestly feels a little immature. He didn\u2019t communicate with you and wasn\u2019t proactive about making sure his needs were met. He could have talked to you when your schedule changed and told you not to keep taking the dog on walks, but he didn\u2019t. Even though you are the main party responsible for this whole mess, he wasn\u2019t just a passive bystander with no ability to affect the outcome. His solution of ignoring the problem doesn\u2019t help either of you, and so even though you are the main/bigger AH, he is being an AH too in refusing to help resolve the situation.", "Look, since you trained your dog to go out at 3, it can be retrained to go out on a different schedule.

He owns the dog as well n I\u2019d bet my savings if it was an issue he created he\u2019d be the first to say you have to deal with it as well not just him, it\u2019s a joint effort whether he likes it or not", "NTA. The dog is a living being that needs care and attention and this responsibility must be shared if you live together.

So denying or suddenly changing this will be bad for them. I live in a house and still get up in the middle of the night to open the door for the dog when they ask me to.\n\nEdit: After getting a few questions answered and finding out that this is just a walk for entertainment instead of actually attending the dogs needs I agree that OP is the AH.", "YTA, just take her before bed and stop giving in to this unnecessary inconvenience.

However, it will take your BF's cooperation and patience. \n\nAs far as how to fix it -- your dog doesn't sleep in a crate, I take it? Maybe get a crate, if you don't already have one. Ensure BF walks the dog right before he goes to bed then puts the dog in the crate, then even on those nights when you do come in late, don't get the dog out. The dog will go back to understanding night time is quiet, sleeping time, not walking or play time. It will take several (maybe many) nights of the dog crying and barking, but do not give in. A healthy adult dog can hold their bladder overnight, so unless there is some unstated reason for why your dog cannot, then there is no reason to continue this habit even if it is possible on the nights you come in late. If the dog has never been in a crate, you might have to start at square one with crate training.

Their preference on sleeping arrangements are not as important as human\u2019s are, specifically your boyfriend\u2019s\u2026.as long as she has a bed or similar, is fed and is loved and cared for, her sleeping preferences are not important. Im sure my 3 dogs would prefer to sleep in bed with me but there simply is no room and I won\u2019t have my sleep interrupted like that. Do you know what I mean? I mean what if he had one and wanted his lizard to sleep in bed with you guys cause it\u2019s warm and the lizard preferred it that way? It would disrupt your sleep cause those things can scratch like hell with their nails. Food for thought.", "It\u2019s difficult I know, you care so much you want to what\u2019s best. Perhaps at this stage it might be worth seeking outside expertise for some human training. Train the human first to train the dog.", "Yeah, no. You DIRECTLY woke him up ON PURPOSE in the middle of his sleep cycle, that is not that same as making some regular noise throughout the day. Not only that, but YOU are the one with the abnormal schedule, not him and expecting him to take responsibility for that when you won't even take responsibility for the way you trained your dog is beyond childish. YTA.", "I didn\u2019t say put a muzzle on her as soon as you come home. I said put a muzzle on her if she keeps barking at 3am. She\u2019ll learn that she will be muzzled because she keeps barking at 3am. \n\nWhy even have a dog if you can\u2019t look after it properly. You clearly can\u2019t seem to teach yours good habits.", "So why did you start walking her at 3am to begin with?\u2026.", "You\u2019re both being ridiculous.  Not the same situation at all.", "Or people are recognizing that you are in the wrong in this situation.  You did not have to take the dog out when it first started.  You\u2019re the one at fault for creating this habit.  You deal with it.  This isn\u2019t a baby.  The dog can be trained(by you) to not wake up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom.  Not that difficult.", "My stepdad did the same thing with our dogs. Started taking him out after he\u2019d already been out an hour previously and now it\u2019s an every night drama, pisses me off but all of us are responsible for the dogs no matter who creates a bad habit, he shouldn\u2019t have agreed to get a dog if he wasn\u2019t up for the responsibilities of one", "INFO does your boyfriend work? Does he need sleep?", "No, not this. You\u2019ve seen enough comments here to understand that you are indeed the asshole, yes? Human beings who work NEED sleep, and as he had no hand in creating the problem, he shouldn\u2019t have to sacrifice sleep (his health), to fix it. You should have been stronger, but you weren\u2019t, so now you have a barking dog. Staying in the bathroom to force your boyfriend to get out of bed and interrupt his much-needed sleep because you just didn\u2019t feel like dealing with your responsibilities is not cool. So address that, then move on to a solution. There are many dog trainers who can help with this, and I\u2019m sure there are other subs for that. As for THIS sub, you have your answer according to 99% of the comments here. Apologize to your boyfriend and deal with your own shit.", "Why did you start walking her in the middle of the night if you didn't want to continue doing it?", "You can still say hello to your pupper when you come home. Just don't let her out of the crate, speak in a low voice, and try your best to keep her calm. Then say goodnight and walk away. She sounds like she might have a bit of separation anxiety, which is a whole different problem you might need to work on in the future. I don't want to advocate medicating your dog, because I am not a vet, but for my current dog we were recommended by our vet to use pet-friendly and vet-certified CBD supplements to ease her anxiety. She was a shelter dog and has constant anxiety because of it, no matter what we do. It does seem to help. If your dog is an anxious one, talk to your own vet. \n\nAnyway, though, *I absolutely know it will be difficult*. I own and have owned dogs my entire life. I've always spoiled my dogs more than I should have done. So believe me, I know. Think of it like a parent teaching a child to sleep in their own bed. The child will use any excuse to avoid it (I'm scared, I need to go potty, just one more story, etc.), but not teaching that child to sleep alone creates even more problems. At this point, you are doing your dog a disservice. **And** creating unnecessary strife between you and your BF.", "So why on earth would it need to be walked again at 3? It sounds like you\u2019re both being controlled by a dog.", "Definitely talk to a trainer then, they can help you with the whole process. Dogs are really smart and learn fast, so best luck with the process!", "Then I can't defend you anymore, I understand doing it if it's to avoid holding the whole night, but since it's just for a walk this is something you shouldn't do, it's even dangerous for who's walking.  Sorry OP, but YTA.", "Okay, thanks l I\u2019ll try it because I trust your username lol because same", "Eh. I had my dog 5 years before I met my husband and started cohabitating with him. He didn't grow up with pets and didn't have a desire for one. She's still my dog, my primary responsibility. If I'm out of town, he will take her out and make sure she's fed, but if I'm home, nope, all me. I don't disagree with him either. She's my dog, and it doesn't matter that we've been together a decade, and 2/3rds of her life. He never wanted one, he didn't sign up for it, and frankly I think he's pretty gracious for taking care of her when I am traveling for work.", "It's not like OP's bf has his own dog to walk at 3 in the morning.

Has your bf explicitly stated that he also can\u2019t take the barking?

For every dog I've taken care of it's not so much the schedule but the intervals between potty breaks that matters. It's not going to harm the dog to shift the schedule so that a 3am walk isn't required. She just has to stop rewarding the behavior of expecting (whining/barking for) a walk at that time.

Like 4am. They started taking our dog on a walk at that time and let her get overexcited to the point where she barked nonstop starting at 4am until they took her, waking the whole house. We told them several times to either use her \"on your bed\" or \"go get a toy\" commands until she calmed down or stop taking her if she barked like that because they were rewarding her behavior and they refused saying \"we can't just leave her behind on our walks.\" They absolutely could have because we would take her after dinner but for them it was harder to put in the work to make her calm down first.  She NEVER does that barking with us because she knows it means she doesn't go on a walk until she stops.\n\nOP is enabling this behavior in her dog and has no one to blame but herself. The dog will learn real quick that you don't go for a walk when you're losing your little doggy mind at 3am. Way too many people think their dog is going to have a meltdown if they change their schedule.\n\nAlso if you don't have a command like bed or go get a toy for your hyper dog I highly suggest it.", "My husband is the worst about this stuff.\n\nI will have let the dog out for a solid 20 minutes in the morning into our fenced in yard.

Training dogs in general doesn't take very long - consistency is key. Our dog is a working sort so she'll pick up on tasks very quickly and she retains them (I taught her a modified Snoot quite some time ago and sometimes I'll ask for it and she does it).\n\nShe has also gotten used to being let out in the morning for half an hour or so after Dad leaves for work - he lets her out before then, so this was later trained by my Grandma. Now that falls on me...but I have been attempting to get extra sleep after he goes and Dog has quickly learned that her 30 minutes can wait.

Me and my husband have been together over a decade, and we have both shared animals, and had our own. For example, the cats were always his- he wanted them, he agreed to take care of them. Whereas, the aquatic animals are mine- he did not want them and he has no idea how to care for them, and no desire to besides looking at them or dropping in a food pellet. We will help each other out and obviously never not care for an animal because it isn\u2019t \u201cours\u201d (when it comes down to it we love them all and make sure they\u2019re all cared for), but the day to day responsibilities are definitely not expected of the other person on a day to day basis. \n\nSome people marry farmers but have never farmed in their life.

I pay for their food and vet bills.", "This is what I think some people on reddit are missing; and it does make me question if they've ever been in a relationship before. Sure, it's *technically* not your responsibility - but I'm sorry, your relationship *sucks* if every single thing you do is split up that way. What happens if OP breaks a leg, or gets cancer, or something? Does the dog just get abused because \"it's not his responsibility\"?\n\nOP is YTA *purely* because they expect the dog to be taken for a walk at 3am. That's not reasonable. But the expectation that their partner occasionally help out with the dog *is* reasonable, because when you share a life together you are signing up to help your partner when they need it. Sometimes that means things will be a little uneven. As long as they're not *always* or *very* uneven, that's fine. It is not always going to be exactly, perfectly even. If you're *not* okay with helping and supporting your partner when they need it, then you should not be in a relationship with them.", "I don't know; my dog is almost 11 years old and I've never bothered teaching him not to bark, but he's a well trained dog. It's good for if your dog is a barker I guess but I feel like in OP's case, it's simply a matter of not reinforcing her behaviour by walking her when she does bark. She's basically stuck in a position where the dog is conditioning her rather than the other way around lol.", "But surely you'd make sure before judging and posting?", ">\tBF should have been taking him out before bed.

That\u2019s what I was responding to.", "I am no expert but I believe crate training is just to teach good long term indoor habits and creating the crate as a safe space when they feel anxious. It helps them learn to do their business outside, not tear things up inside, and that they have a safe place to go when feeling anxious. Crating doesn\u2019t last forever, and there are size guidelines like to make sure the dog has plenty of space to stand up, turn around, lay down. Many have 2 doors on them and plenty of space between the wires for air flow and light. I have a crate-trained adult dog I adopted when he was 5 and he definitely sees his crate as his safe and snuggly little den. I have never needed to close the door, in the 3 years I\u2019ve had him. He is incredibly calm, well behaved, obedient, and quiet - despite being a corgi (known for barking at the wind) he has only barked indoors once in these 3 years - when we were playing and I got him riled up enough he insisted that I throw the ball again. When I arrive home, no matter what time, he simply shakes his little \ud83c\udf51 and nubbin and stretches in preparation of cuddles. And looks up at me excitedly of course. No barking or running. When I have to leave without him, I just tell him \u201cyou\u2019re going to stay here\u201d and he goes immediately to his crate, door wide open, to hang out there. Sometimes I feel bad because I actually don\u2019t care if he hangs out in there vs anywhere else, but it at least gives him a place to go that\u2019s out of my way as I\u2019m trying to leave with bags or luggage or whatever. It\u2019s helpful not to have the loaf of bread trip hazard trying to leave with me. \ud83d\ude06 I\u2019m pretty sure he leaves the crate as soon as I\u2019m gone, which is fine because he just spends the time snoozing up against the door, against the couch, or in his doughnut bed. \nI know I can\u2019t chalk all of this up to crate training, but thought I\u2019d share my experience.", "I'm getting this vibe as well.", "Don\u2019t assume", "Yeah, it's just he was predominantly \\*mine\\*. We were a package deal, if I was sick or something he'd walk him even if it was shitty out, he bought him snacks and toys and stuff. Also if we'd broken up he would obviously have come with me. So the boring shit and financials were on me. \n\nMore like he was the 'fun uncle'/'step dad' to dog #1.
