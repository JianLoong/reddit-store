You should not have walked the dog at 3am if her schedule was later.", "Sorry but your bf is right, YTA. You need to train your dog since your shift changed, however, he should help with that. Yall have to gradually get the dog to wait later and later until a reasonable time.\n\nAlso, that was a bad idea from the get-go. BF should have been taking him out before bed. Just because you were coming home at 3am, doesn't mean you should have created that bad habit for him. My fricking Yorkie goes out at 10pm and can wait until 8am before going out again.", "YTA.

Easy as that", "INFO:\n\nAre you not doing night shifts anymore?\n\nIs the dog being let out before your bf/you go to sleep?\n\nOverall sounds like the dog isn't trained--it's barking to go for a walk at 3am like this is normal. You made this a normal habit, and now you'll have to re-train the dog that its not an acceptable or normal habit.\n\nI don't see how your bf is an AH for not wanting to walk a dog at 3am.", "YTA, you did create the issue and you should start breaking the dogs habit if you no longer work nights. Sleep through the night let him bark like a baby would cry. Eventually he will figure out the late night strolls are over.", "you were the one to set the prescedent for 3 am walks, if your schedule changes and it is no longer faesable for you to do those walks you need to re-train the dog for a time that IS reasonable for you  \n\n\nYTA", "YTA. Asking someone to wake up in the middle of the night to walk a dog is total madness. \n\nThe only valid solution here is to get your dog, **like any other dog**, to **SLEEP** at night and to wait until the morning to get a walk. \n\nStop valuing the wants of your dog before the needs of your bf.", "YTA. Take your dog to dog training classes, making somebody get out of bed at 3am for this isn\u2019t cool especially when you\u2019re the one that conditioned the dog to expect a walk at 3am.

You created this habit.", "Why were you walking your dog at 3am when you got home? Did the dog specifically need to go out to relieve herself, or did you just take her out then to spend time with her?\n\nEDIT: OP took the dog out to spend time with her. Sorry OP, in that case YTA. It would be one thing if your bf was not taking the dog out and she had to relieve herself at 3am, but this is a whole other problem that you created unfortunately. Dogs are creatures of habit and thrive on routines. \n\nYou're gonna have to figure out how to condition this nighttime ritual out of her. My thought would be to take her out for longer walks than usual before you go to bed (say if you typically do 15-20 min, do 45 min) to tire her out.

I go through this with my husband. My damn dog can tell time. He gets fed twice and my husband travels a lot. If it\u2019s just me he wakes me up at 7:10. If my husband is at home he gets pushed with the wet nose at 5am. It ticks him off but I said if he just ignored him and told him no like I did a couple of nights he would wait. Your dog will too. Ignore her and tell her no until a new time is established. \n\nMy dog also changes when he asks for lunch. If I\u2019m on the couch he bugs me at exactly 11:50. If I\u2019m anywhere else at home it\u2019s 12:30. It\u2019s bizarre they know this but they also know what time they can get their way based on our behaviors.", "Need more info. Whose dog is it?

Start by setting a new schedule and sticking to it: walk her before bed and then have her go to her bed (or her crate) until morning when she gets her next walk. Do this consistently and she will get used to the new schedule.", "Sooo just to address what I haven\u2019t seen addressed here: \n\nyour last walk of the night is at 8 pm???? And you expect the dog to not have to go out again until the morning??? That is an unrealistic schedule for most dogs, unless you are walking him again at like 4-5 am. Dogs shouldn\u2019t be going more than like 8-9 hours MAX without a potty break. By the time he\u2019s waking you up to let him out, he hasn\u2019t gone out for 7 hours! Of COURSE he has to go out again! \n\nYou guys should be taking him out again right before bed, like around 10 or 11 at least.\n\nESH for terrible walk schedule that clearly works for no one.

That\u2019s probably the only way to get things back to normal. It\u2019s a totally fixable mistake though. For reference, I have a really good routine with my dog and have had zero issues. I do a walk in the morning around 8:30 or 9, another one around 6, and then a final one around 11pm. Gives him plenty of opportunity to get his outside time. If you aren\u2019t already doing 3 walks per day, I highly recommend it. If you already are then I\u2019d try to do something around those times that I do it: morning walk, dinner walk, bedtime walk.
