You should not have walked the dog at 3am if her schedule was later.", "Sorry but your bf is right, YTA. You need to train your dog since your shift changed, however, he should help with that. Yall have to gradually get the dog to wait later and later until a reasonable time.\n\nAlso, that was a bad idea from the get-go. BF should have been taking him out before bed. Just because you were coming home at 3am, doesn't mean you should have created that bad habit for him. My fricking Yorkie goes out at 10pm and can wait until 8am before going out again.", "YTA.

Easy as that", "INFO:\n\nAre you not doing night shifts anymore?\n\nIs the dog being let out before your bf/you go to sleep?\n\nOverall sounds like the dog isn't trained--it's barking to go for a walk at 3am like this is normal. You made this a normal habit, and now you'll have to re-train the dog that its not an acceptable or normal habit.\n\nI don't see how your bf is an AH for not wanting to walk a dog at 3am.", "YTA, you did create the issue and you should start breaking the dogs habit if you no longer work nights. Sleep through the night let him bark like a baby would cry. Eventually he will figure out the late night strolls are over.", "you were the one to set the prescedent for 3 am walks, if your schedule changes and it is no longer faesable for you to do those walks you need to re-train the dog for a time that IS reasonable for you  \n\n\nYTA", "YTA. Asking someone to wake up in the middle of the night to walk a dog is total madness. \n\nThe only valid solution here is to get your dog, **like any other dog**, to **SLEEP** at night and to wait until the morning to get a walk. \n\nStop valuing the wants of your dog before the needs of your bf.", "YTA. Take your dog to dog training classes, making somebody get out of bed at 3am for this isn\u2019t cool especially when you\u2019re the one that conditioned the dog to expect a walk at 3am.

Did the dog specifically need to go out to relieve herself, or did you just take her out then to spend time with her?\n\nEDIT: OP took the dog out to spend time with her. Sorry OP, in that case YTA. It would be one thing if your bf was not taking the dog out and she had to relieve herself at 3am, but this is a whole other problem that you created unfortunately. Dogs are creatures of habit and thrive on routines. \n\nYou're gonna have to figure out how to condition this nighttime ritual out of her. My thought would be to take her out for longer walks than usual before you go to bed (say if you typically do 15-20 min, do 45 min) to tire her out.

I go through this with my husband. My damn dog can tell time. He gets fed twice and my husband travels a lot. If it\u2019s just me he wakes me up at 7:10. If my husband is at home he gets pushed with the wet nose at 5am. It ticks him off but I said if he just ignored him and told him no like I did a couple of nights he would wait. Your dog will too. Ignore her and tell her no until a new time is established. \n\nMy dog also changes when he asks for lunch. If I\u2019m on the couch he bugs me at exactly 11:50.

Do this consistently and she will get used to the new schedule.", "Sooo just to address what I haven\u2019t seen addressed here: \n\nyour last walk of the night is at 8 pm???? And you expect the dog to not have to go out again until the morning??? That is an unrealistic schedule for most dogs, unless you are walking him again at like 4-5 am. Dogs shouldn\u2019t be going more than like 8-9 hours MAX without a potty break. By the time he\u2019s waking you up to let him out, he hasn\u2019t gone out for 7 hours! Of COURSE he has to go out again! \n\nYou guys should be taking him out again right before bed, like around 10 or 11 at least.\n\nESH for terrible walk schedule that clearly works for no one.

I do a walk in the morning around 8:30 or 9, another one around 6, and then a final one around 11pm. Gives him plenty of opportunity to get his outside time. If you aren\u2019t already doing 3 walks per day, I highly recommend it. If you already are then I\u2019d try to do something around those times that I do it: morning walk, dinner walk, bedtime walk.

His anger at you is justified, but helping the dog establish a new routine is a problem that\u2019s going to take both of you to fix. You probably should do the bulk of the work, but he doesn\u2019t get to sit around and do nothing. \n\nIf the dog whining at 3AM bothers him so much, he can do something to actually resolve the situation instead of just ignoring it until you fix it; to me, that feels somewhat passive aggressive and isn\u2019t constructive or helpful, and honestly feels a little immature. He didn\u2019t communicate with you and wasn\u2019t proactive about making sure his needs were met. He could have talked to you when your schedule changed and told you not to keep taking the dog on walks, but he didn\u2019t. Even though you are the main party responsible for this whole mess, he wasn\u2019t just a passive bystander with no ability to affect the outcome. His solution of ignoring the problem doesn\u2019t help either of you, and so even though you are the main/bigger AH, he is being an AH too in refusing to help resolve the situation.", "Look, since you trained your dog to go out at 3, it can be retrained to go out on a different schedule.

He owns the dog as well n I\u2019d bet my savings if it was an issue he created he\u2019d be the first to say you have to deal with it as well not just him, it\u2019s a joint effort whether he likes it or not", "NTA. The dog is a living being that needs care and attention and this responsibility must be shared if you live together. When he pretends to be asleep or ignores the dog barking he's being selfish for not only ignoring the dog, but also the fact that you're tired from a shift that is NEVER easy (also a nurse here). \n\nDogs that live in apartments usually hold their necessities for a long time waiting for the walk time and they learn how to hold till it's time to go out.

However, it will take your BF's cooperation and patience. \n\nAs far as how to fix it -- your dog doesn't sleep in a crate, I take it? Maybe get a crate, if you don't already have one. Ensure BF walks the dog right before he goes to bed then puts the dog in the crate, then even on those nights when you do come in late, don't get the dog out. The dog will go back to understanding night time is quiet, sleeping time, not walking or play time. It will take several (maybe many) nights of the dog crying and barking, but do not give in. A healthy adult dog can hold their bladder overnight, so unless there is some unstated reason for why your dog cannot, then there is no reason to continue this habit even if it is possible on the nights you come in late. If the dog has never been in a crate, you might have to start at square one with crate training.

It would disrupt your sleep cause those things can scratch like hell with their nails. Food for thought.", "It\u2019s difficult I know, you care so much you want to what\u2019s best. Perhaps at this stage it might be worth seeking outside expertise for some human training. Train the human first to train the dog.", "Yeah, no. You DIRECTLY woke him up ON PURPOSE in the middle of his sleep cycle, that is not that same as making some regular noise throughout the day. Not only that, but YOU are the one with the abnormal schedule, not him and expecting him to take responsibility for that when you won't even take responsibility for the way you trained your dog is beyond childish. YTA.", "I didn\u2019t say put a muzzle on her as soon as you come home. I said put a muzzle on her if she keeps barking at 3am. She\u2019ll learn that she will be muzzled because she keeps barking at 3am. \n\nWhy even have a dog if you can\u2019t look after it properly. You clearly can\u2019t seem to teach yours good habits.", "So why did you start walking her at 3am to begin with?\u2026.", "You\u2019re both being ridiculous.  Not the same situation at all.", "Or people are recognizing that you are in the wrong in this situation.  You did not have to take the dog out when it first started.  You\u2019re the one at fault for creating this habit.  You deal with it.  This isn\u2019t a baby.  The dog can be trained(by you) to not wake up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom.  Not that difficult.", "My stepdad did the same thing with our dogs. Started taking him out after he\u2019d already been out an hour previously and now it\u2019s an every night drama, pisses me off but all of us are responsible for the dogs no matter who creates a bad habit, he shouldn\u2019t have agreed to get a dog if he wasn\u2019t up for the responsibilities of one", "INFO does your boyfriend work? Does he need sleep?", "No, not this. You\u2019ve seen enough comments here to understand that you are indeed the asshole, yes? Human beings who work NEED sleep, and as he had no hand in creating the problem, he shouldn\u2019t have to sacrifice sleep (his health), to fix it. You should have been stronger, but you weren\u2019t, so now you have a barking dog. Staying in the bathroom to force your boyfriend to get out of bed and interrupt his much-needed sleep because you just didn\u2019t feel like dealing with your responsibilities is not cool. So address that, then move on to a solution. There are many dog trainers who can help with this, and I\u2019m sure there are other subs for that. As for THIS sub, you have your answer according to 99% of the comments here. Apologize to your boyfriend and deal with your own shit.", "Why did you start walking her in the middle of the night if you didn't want to continue doing it?", "You can still say hello to your pupper when you come home. Just don't let her out of the crate, speak in a low voice, and try your best to keep her calm. Then say goodnight and walk away. She sounds like she might have a bit of separation anxiety, which is a whole different problem you might need to work on in the future. I don't want to advocate medicating your dog, because I am not a vet, but for my current dog we were recommended by our vet to use pet-friendly and vet-certified CBD supplements to ease her anxiety. She was a shelter dog and has constant anxiety because of it, no matter what we do. It does seem to help. If your dog is an anxious one, talk to your own vet. \n\nAnyway, though, *I absolutely know it will be difficult*. I own and have owned dogs my entire life. I've always spoiled my dogs more than I should have done. So believe me, I know. Think of it like a parent teaching a child to sleep in their own bed. The child will use any excuse to avoid it (I'm scared, I need to go potty, just one more story, etc.), but not teaching that child to sleep alone creates even more problems. At this point, you are doing your dog a disservice. **And** creating unnecessary strife between you and your BF.", "So why on earth would it need to be walked again at 3? It sounds like you\u2019re both being controlled by a dog.", "Definitely talk to a trainer then, they can help you with the whole process. Dogs are really smart and learn fast, so best luck with the process!", "Then I can't defend you anymore, I understand doing it if it's to avoid holding the whole night, but since it's just for a walk this is something you shouldn't do, it's even dangerous for who's walking.  Sorry OP, but YTA.", "Okay, thanks l I\u2019ll try it because I trust your username lol because same", "Eh. I had my dog 5 years before I met my husband and started cohabitating with him. He didn't grow up with pets and didn't have a desire for one. She's still my dog, my primary responsibility. If I'm out of town, he will take her out and make sure she's fed, but if I'm home, nope, all me. I don't disagree with him either. She's my dog, and it doesn't matter that we've been together a decade, and 2/3rds of her life. He never wanted one, he didn't sign up for it, and frankly I think he's pretty gracious for taking care of her when I am traveling for work.", "It's not like OP's bf has his own dog to walk at 3 in the morning. It's unreasonable. You're looking at it from your perspective as a pet owner, would your roommate look after your dogs and cats if he didn't have his own and would he want get up at the 3 in the AM? Doubt it.", "\"I don't do it like that so you suck for doing it that way\" -the totally selfless redditor", "Yes I\u2019d bring them back to bed but I\u2019d be struggling if they started screaming and tantruming and waking up the neighbours.\n\nAlso if I didn\u2019t see my kid for 12 hours I\u2019m going to have missed them and would want to spend a little bit of time with them before sending them away.", "Ehh, I've lived on nights with a dog and it's not hard to teach most dogs that the routine on nights when the family is home at bedtime and the nights when someone isn't home at bedtime is different.", "I get this, not sure why people expect you to work 7 nights a week?", "She goes on more than 2 walks a day without the 3am walk", "That\u2019s what I\u2019m saying though. She wants to go out with me because she missed me. Keeping her home will create even more noise because she\u2019ll get so excited and runs and jumps up and down.", "She\u2019s almost 2. She doesn\u2019t always sleep in our bed but has her bed in our room. I know what you mean but we don\u2019t mind having her in our room if it makes her happy. Dogs live such short lives.", "Because I\u2019d come home at 3am. I wouldn\u2019t have seen her all day long. She wouldn\u2019t be waiting by the door because she knows when I get home. Usually very excited and loud because she missed me. So to avoid her having the zoomies at 3am I\u2019d take her on a quick walk because I missed her and she missed me and she\u2019d go to bed straight away when we\u2019d get home.", "Yes he does. Yes I get it it\u2019s hypocritical of me to complain", "Because she\u2019d be super noisy when I got home at night so I\u2019d take her out so she burns some of that energy", "Thank you so much for getting it and being more understanding than the rest of these comments. I\u2019ll try your tips. You\u2019re so right, it does sound a bit like separation anxiety because wherever my schedule changes it\u2019s like she is anticipating me getting ready for work. She\u2019s a sweetheart.", "Then YOU need to tell the dog no every time she barks at night.  Same as any other time the dog does a bad behavior.", "Then keep your dog inside and just have them readjust to your schedule. They are your dog, not your SO dog.", "Muzzle time, then.", "It worked for my dog. She only wakes me up if it\u2019s an emergency now. I went from overnights to days and everywhere in-between with her. If you can make a habit you can adjust or break it.", "I had a dog before I got in to my current relationship, he was 'my dog'. Vet bills  food were 100% on me. He'd walk him when he felt like it, but the daily obligatory rain or hail or shine walks were on me also.\n\nAfter he passed we mutually agreed to get another dog, now everything is 50/50. I think that was a pretty fair way to approach things.", "I'd argue he kinda did sign up for your dog when you guys got together. If your significant other knows you have a dog and you guys get married, obviously they know that dog is now a big part of your lives. A step below having kids together imo", "Yeah wtf. No walks in the middle of the night- it\u2019s actually wildly easy to be consistent with this.", "OP commented that it isn\u2019t a bathroom break. It\u2019s \u201cjust for fun and exercise\u201d.", "If you don\u2019t know what to do, then you should be contacting a trainer. This is unfair on both your boyfriend and your dog. The situation is what it is now, mistakes were made you learned your lesson, no more walks at 3am. But if you genuinely don\u2019t know what to do - get a trainer. Sooner rather then later", "Why can\u2019t you do something indoors with your dog when you come home? Attention I get but cool it with the walks.", "It\u2019s unfair that people are downvoting your comments even when you\u2019re clearly trying to fix the situation and recognised that you messed up. For the record, yes I think you messed up but you don\u2019t come across as a bad person, just maybe should\u2019ve done your homework before having a dog (they\u2019re a bit like children but a little less intense, not like owning a cat or any other pet). PLENTY of people do this but at least you\u2019ve admitted you made a mistake and you\u2019re looking to rectify it now. I gotta give you credit for that.", "But if she just wants ro spend time with you when you get home, can't you just take her into the bedroom and cuddle with her and sleep with her?\n\nAnd why does she still need night walks the nights you are not working? Then she'll have spend time with you and it's not like you're just coming home.\n\nOr maybe the solution is to try to make her bond more with your boyfriend so age doesn't miss you so much when you're gone.", "so it's you and your dogs time?  then WHY tf are you insisting on your bf to take over this at 3am instead of his need for sleep.  you either are incredibly weak minded where you can't handle a dog barking a little bit or just completely insensitive to other people's lives, including your boyfriend who needs to sleep.", "You\u2019ve said yourself that your BF is a heavy sleeper. Just play with the freaking dog inside. This is your doing, and it\u2019s your job to fix it. \n\nExhausting bro.", "Well then I understand it would be annoying to be the one who does it every time, but you seem to have trained a bad habit and just have to stop enabling it. Maybe your boyfriend walks it before or after work, and you take on a chore he has? Depending on work schedules maybe you can walk late morning and he walks at night?", "The problem to me here is that he NEVER does it, I understand that he also has to work and that the dog had a bad habit that need to be corrected, but he's also responsible for the dog and this shouldn't be exclusively your task.", "A step below having kids together? Kids need a loving parent to develop well into life. The dog just needs to be walked. This lady should walk her own dog.", "Oh, wow, that\u2019s even less necessary at three am!", "She\u2019s too loud and excited when I come home. It started when she was a puppy and she\u2019d jump everywhere the moment I\u2019d get home because she would be waiting by the door all night :(", "Exactly some comments are unnecessarily harsh. I don\u2019t like the behaviour either but I need some extra help from him to fix it.\n\nInitially the walks were to get her out of the house because she would be waiting by the door for me and get insanely excited when she realised I got home. I started working night shifts when COVID was intense just a month in after we got her. So of course she was wondering where did that other human disappear too. \n\nA 3am walk after a long shift isn\u2019t what I want either after I\u2019ve been on my feet all night", "Ok that still makes her the asshole in this case..", "I can deal with the barking but doubt the neighbours would appreciate it and neither would my boyfriend. To problem is that it turned into a habit on the days I\u2019m not working nights.\n\nIf I could train her to differentiate between my night shift days and my normal days I don\u2019t mind taking her on a walk. But I don\u2019t know how to help her understand the difference.", "But I also understand it's annoying for the boyfriend to suddenly have to get out of bed in the middle of the night to walk the dog, just because OP started this habit.", "And it keeps your neighbors from liking you", "sounds untrained to me! YTA! grow up and don't expect to have your bf get up at 3am to walk your damn dog", "Ya I don\u2019t think dogs can really be trained to that level of awareness for what day you work or not, but I\u2019m not a professional dog trainer lol.  But for me personally, if I was your boyfriend, I rather lay in bed and endure the barking and try to sleep instead of either 1) getting up to take them for a walk, which includes me walking in the middle of the night, or 2) getting into an argument with my gf about not taking the dog out.  Has your bf explicitly stated that he also can\u2019t take the barking? Seems like you both don\u2019t want to deal with the situation, so seems like you can have a sit down talk to discuss a better schedule for the dog going outside and how to move past this habit it is in.", "I didn\u2019t say that because I assumed it\u2019s a given lol", "It would help but I\u2019ll try the dog subreddit first", "Yes he has. When I work nights I try my best to be quiet so when we got the dog that changed because she started barking when I came home so I began taking her out.", "I just wanna say kudos to being open to suggestions too. Lots of people are being hard on you, but you've responded positively to those who have made suggestions. \n\nBest of luck!", "You should also check out some episodes of \"It's me or the dog\" with Victoria Stillwell on YouTube. Watching her has helped me learn so many amazing training techniques", "Thank you!", "Thank you!", "Not really. She hates the crate and associates it with going to the vet."]}
