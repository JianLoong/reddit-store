You created a bad habit for the dog. Now instead of fixing it, you're reinforcing it. That's on you.", "YTA. You have to get her back on a more normal schedule. You should not have walked the dog at 3am if her schedule was later.", "Sorry but your bf is right, YTA. You need to train your dog since your shift changed, however, he should help with that. Yall have to gradually get the dog to wait later and later until a reasonable time.\n\nAlso, that was a bad idea from the get-go. BF should have been taking him out before bed. Just because you were coming home at 3am, doesn't mean you should have created that bad habit for him. My fricking Yorkie goes out at 10pm and can wait until 8am before going out again.", "YTA. He\u2019s right. You created it. You fix it.", "YTA you created the issue, you deal with it. Easy as that", "INFO:\n\nAre you not doing night shifts anymore?\n\nIs the dog being let out before your bf/you go to sleep?\n\nOverall sounds like the dog isn't trained--it's barking to go for a walk at 3am like this is normal. You made this a normal habit, and now you'll have to re-train the dog that its not an acceptable or normal habit.\n\nI don't see how your bf is an AH for not wanting to walk a dog at 3am.", "YTA, you did create the issue and you should start breaking the dogs habit if you no longer work nights. Sleep through the night let him bark like a baby would cry. Eventually he will figure out the late night strolls are over.", "you were the one to set the prescedent for 3 am walks, if your schedule changes and it is no longer faesable for you to do those walks you need to re-train the dog for a time that IS reasonable for you  \n\n\nYTA", "YTA. Asking someone to wake up in the middle of the night to walk a dog is total madness. \n\nThe only valid solution here is to get your dog, **like any other dog**, to **SLEEP** at night and to wait until the morning to get a walk. \n\nStop valuing the wants of your dog before the needs of your bf.", "YTA. Take your dog to dog training classes, making somebody get out of bed at 3am for this isn\u2019t cool especially when you\u2019re the one that conditioned the dog to expect a walk at 3am. To let it out in the garden now and again for the toilet yeah, but there\u2019s no need for anybody to be walking dogs at 3am.", "YTA.  The dog needs to learn the new schedule, and by either of you waking up to take him out at 3 you're just delaying that learning process.  You created this habit.", "Why were you walking your dog at 3am when you got home? Did the dog specifically need to go out to relieve herself, or did you just take her out then to spend time with her?\n\nEDIT: OP took the dog out to spend time with her. Sorry OP, in that case YTA. It would be one thing if your bf was not taking the dog out and she had to relieve herself at 3am, but this is a whole other problem that you created unfortunately. Dogs are creatures of habit and thrive on routines. \n\nYou're gonna have to figure out how to condition this nighttime ritual out of her. My thought would be to take her out for longer walks than usual before you go to bed (say if you typically do 15-20 min, do 45 min) to tire her out. It's a time commitment for sure, but it's way better than being woken up at 3am constantly.", "Yes. You are indeed an asshole.", "YTA\n\nyou need to retrain the dog and both of you need to be on the same page about when is a good time to go for a walk", "YTA. You did create the issue. You can work to ween the dog off the 3 AM walks, but otherwise I don't see why it's \"unfair\" for you to be the one to follow through on the 3 AM commitment that *you* made to your dog.", "I get that you used to work night shifts and it was hard on you and all, but *you\u2019re* the one who made your doggo get used to this schedule. if I had to wake up at 3AM to walk my dog, I\u2019d be kinda annoyed too. YTA, but at least it\u2019s an easy-ish fix!", "Info: is she not being let out before bedtime? Is it just she got used to the habit and not she needs to pee?", "YTA and yes you should fix it.", "YTA. You need to retrain your dog to make it through the night again. Getting up at 3AM just to walk your dog is ridiculous.", "YTA. Retrain the schedule now that you\u2019re no longer doing night shift. I\u2019m all for splitting pet responsibilities but this one\u2019s on you.", "Yta. You created this problem and now you don't want to deal with it", "Wtf, obviously you need to RE-TRAIN your dog to get walks when it works for you (both). Not to wake up in the middle of the night just because that\u2019s what you used to do. That is insane. YTA all day long", "YTA\n\nYou 100% created this issue. If my partner expected me to get up at 3am and walk the dog, they'd be told to hit the bricks.", "YTA. Unless this is a case of \u201cI didn\u2019t want a dog and told him I wouldn\u2019t take care of her\u201d, you should be helping out, he shouldn\u2019t have to get up at 3 AM to walk the dog. You have to get her out of that habit.", "EDIT: YTA. There was no need to start that with the dog and now your BF has to wake up at 3AM because of what you did.", "Kind of an AH. I go through this with my husband. My damn dog can tell time. He gets fed twice and my husband travels a lot. If it\u2019s just me he wakes me up at 7:10. If my husband is at home he gets pushed with the wet nose at 5am. It ticks him off but I said if he just ignored him and told him no like I did a couple of nights he would wait. Your dog will too. Ignore her and tell her no until a new time is established. \n\nMy dog also changes when he asks for lunch. If I\u2019m on the couch he bugs me at exactly 11:50. If I\u2019m anywhere else at home it\u2019s 12:30. It\u2019s bizarre they know this but they also know what time they can get their way based on our behaviors.", "Need more info. Whose dog is it? When does BF need to get up in the morning? Have you or your BF made any effort to get the dog on a more normal schedule?", "YTA", "YTA. You created this situation and now you\u2019re not only refusing to fix it, you\u2019re angry at your boyfriend for not fixing it for you? Not only that, but you stayed in the bathroom to coerce your boyfriend into waking up to do what you wanted? Yuck", "YTA", "I work weird hours as well and my dog will hop up if she thinks I\u2019m up when I go pee. I go back to bed, she will settle quickly when she realizes it\u2019s not time for a walk. Don\u2019t reinforce the behaviour and it will adjust.", "YTA, and you sound like a very inconsiderate  partner.", "ESH cause none of you actually communicate.\n\ngirlfriend hid in the bathroom and boyfriend is spontaneously deceased.", "NAH\u2026.you accidentally conditioned the dog for the night time walk, and now it\u2019s an issue.  No one\u2019s fault really\u2026no malice involved.  \n\nBut the onus is on you.  I would consider sending the dog to doggie daycare to wear her out.  She\u2019ll be so exhausted she\u2019ll sleep through the night.", "Don't have kids. ESH.", "Don't have kids if this is how you fight about a dog. Lol", "NAH.\n\nYou need to get your pup used to a new schedule, not rearrange your schedules around her and interrupt your healthy sleep patterns. Start by setting a new schedule and sticking to it: walk her before bed and then have her go to her bed (or her crate) until morning when she gets her next walk. Do this consistently and she will get used to the new schedule.", "Sooo just to address what I haven\u2019t seen addressed here: \n\nyour last walk of the night is at 8 pm???? And you expect the dog to not have to go out again until the morning??? That is an unrealistic schedule for most dogs, unless you are walking him again at like 4-5 am. Dogs shouldn\u2019t be going more than like 8-9 hours MAX without a potty break. By the time he\u2019s waking you up to let him out, he hasn\u2019t gone out for 7 hours! Of COURSE he has to go out again! \n\nYou guys should be taking him out again right before bed, like around 10 or 11 at least.\n\nESH for terrible walk schedule that clearly works for no one. ESH x 2 for expecting a dog to hold his pee longer than an adult human could.", "NTA.  He created the issue by not walking the dog originally instead of waiting for you.
