I can see in a comment that it's only happened a handful of times over the course of a few weeks. It's an adjustment. Anyone who thinks they can easily switch after 24 years of referring to a person by a different name or gender is kidding themselves. You can be an ally and still mess up on occasion. You won't be the only person in their life who has the occasional slip up, whether it's in their presence or not.", "Nta, if it took them a week to come up with a new name especially after not being to 100% about their own self, yet somehow expect everyone to immediately forget their old name?

I know a few trans/NB people and while it is a personal thing, generally people are more bothered that you're trying.\n\nOfc you're not going to get it right every time, you've known them by their birth name for so long. There has to be a bit of understanding with this stuff - you're trying.", "NTA as long as you\u2019re honestly trying to not deadname them and you\u2019ve apologized. Mistakes happen, especially when it\u2019s so new.", "NTA, \n\nYou didn't mean to call them that, and they only changed it recently. People can't expect to drop and change everything at the top of a hat, it takes a while to get used to.", "NTA. They can't just expect you to rewire your brain in the space of a few weeks after 24 years.\nIf you were doing it on purpose then yeah you'd be the asshole. But I don't think you are.\n\n\nThinking about it whilst I wrote this.. People have also been using the term \"dead name\". And this is an assumption on my part.. Your sibling considers the person they were.. Name gender and whatever else.. Is now dead. But for you, they're still physically alive, they look the same, and act the same, so to make that adjustment quickly will be difficult.\n\nAnd when it happens again. Because let's face it, it probably will. Just apologise, explain its a big transition (no pun intended) for you too, that you are trying and it's not on purpose.", "NTA. It takes time to make that big of a change. You've been calling them that name their whole life and all of a sudden they want it to be something different, which will take time. I'm tired of hearing that everyone has to get every part of it right with the pronouns and the new name and if you don't, you're an A H. It's nonsense and people need to realize that others won't always remember because all of this is still a relatively new concept, and lots of people, myself included haven't experienced it a lot, so we sometimes slip up but you're clearly making an effort so they need to cut you some slack and know you're doing your best.", "My oldest son is trans, and it took me some time to get used to using his new name and pronouns. I would sometimes use his dead name or the wrong pronouns out of habit, but I always caught it and corrected myself right away, and my son was understanding.

Your sibling wants acceptance and usibg their dead name is not fun for them at all. However it can take a while to switch completely, especially as youve known someone longer. Correct way to do it is if you slip and dead name your sibling you immediately pause, apologize, correct yourself, and move on. Not OMG! Im so sorry im a horrible but quick. \nHey can you pass the salt. Thanks 'deadname'... dang sorry 'new name'. \nEvery time you slip. And make sure you are using the name in your head, with your friends and family, and correcting yourself whenever you screw up, regardless of who is around, because thats how you learn.", "NTA but you should try to have a 1 on 1 talk with them to tell them you're not doing this on purpose or maybe you should try to come up with a nickname based of that name that both of you like.", "NAH as long as you keep trying to get it right. My childhood friend came out as a trans man a few years ago. It was surprisingly hard for me to get the pronouns right, even though I found it very easy for people I barely knew (like Elliot Page for example). \n\nGot easier! He deserved the effort, and so does your sibling. You will get there.", "NAH. You should try harder for your sibling and they have the right to be annoyed.

Or are you consistently misgendering and deadnaming them and not really trying hard to catch yourself?  Because the first is understandable, the second is pretty  disrespectful.  If it's the first, just keeping putting the effort in and it will get easier with time, and hopefully your sibling can be understanding that persistence of habit is a real thing that takes time to break.\n\nOne of my kids is nonbinary and at first I REALLY had to work hard to use they/them pronouns just because I hadn't used them before.  Now it's second nature, it does get easier and it can mean so much to the person who felt consistently misgendered for so long.", "NTA\n\nIntent matters a great deal here.  If you are **genuinely** just slipping up and otherwise trying to remember, then not the AH.  I understand it can be tricky to call someone you've called one thing for 24 years, a different thing, overnight.  \n\n  That said, please try to do better as this is probably very important to your sibling and they'll appreciate it.  So.. put some effort in to remembering!", "NAH but try harder to remember. Deadnaming a trans person is incredibly insensitive", "NTA. I think people are reading more into this than there is. I get my pets and roommates names mixed up all the time. My roommate has never been offended by accidentally being called \u2018Kitty\u2019 even though she identifies as human and not a cat. It\u2019s a mistake, it will take time to adjust.", " NAH it\u2019s very difficult to not slip up. Try to be as respectful as possible", "NAH. Enby here\n\nPeople saying NTA are missing the fact that your sibling is allowed to be upset about dead naming. \n\nHowever, I make mistakes all the time, misgender nonbinary friends, and I'm enby myself.

People make mistakes, absolutely, and that's OK within reason, but the other person is still allowed to be upset, especially if it's continual.", "Gonna go with soft YTA.    \n    \nFrom your comments, it does sound like you want to use the right pronouns and the right name. That being said, there's something which you specifically mentioned: your sibling's initial gender identity.

Fuck the people getting triggered by a name", "NTA- its still new to everyone and they will have to be patient with you too. Our daughter changed her name when she thought she was transgender. We did our best and slipped sometimes but always apologized. She kept the name but decided she wasn\u2019t male but somewhere in between. I still sometimes slip when I am remembering her as a little one but usually not when she\u2019s there. Funny how memories work.\n\nThat said, my coworker transitioned about a year after she started on my team. I\u2019d been really conscientious of using her new name until a couple of months ago, her deadname just dropped out of my mouth during a meeting. I immediately stumbled as if I\u2019d meant someone else and then apologized via PM. The only reason I can think of was that I was thinking of something that they\u2019d told me before they transitioned and my brain farted. They were very gracious and accepted my apology. This is several years post-transitioning. So slip ups happen without being an asshole.", "I mean, I get that you're adjusting, but you need to work harder on it. Of course they're going to be annoyed and correct you when you get it wrong, that doesn't make them an asshole. The fact that you need more than two weeks to fully adjust doesn't make you an asshole either. \n\nI'm interested in how you react to slipping up and deadnaming your sibling, though.", "i don\u2019t know if i\u2019d go as far as to say you\u2019re the asshole but i think you should be putting in the effort to internalize your sibling\u2019s identity. a big part of adjusting to a loved one coming out as trans is not to memorize what they want to be called, but to internalize the way they view themselves as the way you view them. it can be hard but it\u2019ll improve your relationship in the long run", "N T A for occasionally slipping up on the name, if you were not undermining the in other ways. I've occasionally slipped up on the names or pronouns  of trans people, and they've waved it off as they could see it was an honest mistake in a pattern of supportive behaviour. \n\nBut given the way you refer to them as \"starting to think they were trans\" and your use of female pronouns later in your post (\"her birth name\") the \"slip\" fits into a broader pattern of unsupportive behaviour.

It is great you are trying but using their dead name isn't okay.

And it\u2019s been two and a half years since I\u2019ve been out of the closet!

What i used to do was to always correct myself out loud. Always use her pronouns and name as often as possible and also keep repeating her name in my mind whenever i wasn't doing anything.

It often makes us question whether anyone will ever actually see us as our gender, or if they're only faking it to our faces. When it feels bad to be called your deadname, it feels horrific, Kafkaesque.
