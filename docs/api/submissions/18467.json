I can see in a comment that it's only happened a handful of times over the course of a few weeks. It's an adjustment. Anyone who thinks they can easily switch after 24 years of referring to a person by a different name or gender is kidding themselves. You can be an ally and still mess up on occasion. You won't be the only person in their life who has the occasional slip up, whether it's in their presence or not.", "Nta, if it took them a week to come up with a new name especially after not being to 100% about their own self, yet somehow expect everyone to immediately forget their old name?

I know a few trans/NB people and while it is a personal thing, generally people are more bothered that you're trying.\n\nOfc you're not going to get it right every time, you've known them by their birth name for so long. There has to be a bit of understanding with this stuff - you're trying.", "NTA as long as you\u2019re honestly trying to not deadname them and you\u2019ve apologized. Mistakes happen, especially when it\u2019s so new.", "NTA, \n\nYou didn't mean to call them that, and they only changed it recently. People can't expect to drop and change everything at the top of a hat, it takes a while to get used to.", "NTA. They can't just expect you to rewire your brain in the space of a few weeks after 24 years.\nIf you were doing it on purpose then yeah you'd be the asshole. But I don't think you are.\n\n\nThinking about it whilst I wrote this.. People have also been using the term \"dead name\". And this is an assumption on my part.. Your sibling considers the person they were.. Name gender and whatever else.. Is now dead. But for you, they're still physically alive, they look the same, and act the same, so to make that adjustment quickly will be difficult.\n\nAnd when it happens again. Because let's face it, it probably will. Just apologise, explain its a big transition (no pun intended) for you too, that you are trying and it's not on purpose.", "NTA. It takes time to make that big of a change. You've been calling them that name their whole life and all of a sudden they want it to be something different, which will take time. I'm tired of hearing that everyone has to get every part of it right with the pronouns and the new name and if you don't, you're an A H. It's nonsense and people need to realize that others won't always remember because all of this is still a relatively new concept, and lots of people, myself included haven't experienced it a lot, so we sometimes slip up but you're clearly making an effort so they need to cut you some slack and know you're doing your best.", "My oldest son is trans, and it took me some time to get used to using his new name and pronouns. I would sometimes use his dead name or the wrong pronouns out of habit, but I always caught it and corrected myself right away, and my son was understanding.

Your sibling wants acceptance and usibg their dead name is not fun for them at all. However it can take a while to switch completely, especially as youve known someone longer. Correct way to do it is if you slip and dead name your sibling you immediately pause, apologize, correct yourself, and move on. Not OMG! Im so sorry im a horrible but quick. \nHey can you pass the salt. Thanks 'deadname'... dang sorry 'new name'. \nEvery time you slip. And make sure you are using the name in your head, with your friends and family, and correcting yourself whenever you screw up, regardless of who is around, because thats how you learn.", "NTA but you should try to have a 1 on 1 talk with them to tell them you're not doing this on purpose or maybe you should try to come up with a nickname based of that name that both of you like.", "NAH as long as you keep trying to get it right. My childhood friend came out as a trans man a few years ago. It was surprisingly hard for me to get the pronouns right, even though I found it very easy for people I barely knew (like Elliot Page for example). \n\nGot easier! He deserved the effort, and so does your sibling. You will get there.", "NAH. You should try harder for your sibling and they have the right to be annoyed.

The frustration for your sibling is real and they are in full right to be mad, but the change won\u2019t happen over night.

Or are you consistently misgendering and deadnaming them and not really trying hard to catch yourself?  Because the first is understandable, the second is pretty  disrespectful.  If it's the first, just keeping putting the effort in and it will get easier with time, and hopefully your sibling can be understanding that persistence of habit is a real thing that takes time to break.\n\nOne of my kids is nonbinary and at first I REALLY had to work hard to use they/them pronouns just because I hadn't used them before.  Now it's second nature, it does get easier and it can mean so much to the person who felt consistently misgendered for so long.", "NTA\n\nIntent matters a great deal here.  If you are **genuinely** just slipping up and otherwise trying to remember, then not the AH.  I understand it can be tricky to call someone you've called one thing for 24 years, a different thing, overnight.  \n\n  That said, please try to do better as this is probably very important to your sibling and they'll appreciate it.  So.. put some effort in to remembering!", "NAH but try harder to remember. Deadnaming a trans person is incredibly insensitive", "NTA. I think people are reading more into this than there is. I get my pets and roommates names mixed up all the time. My roommate has never been offended by accidentally being called \u2018Kitty\u2019 even though she identifies as human and not a cat. It\u2019s a mistake, it will take time to adjust.", " NAH it\u2019s very difficult to not slip up. Try to be as respectful as possible", "NAH. Enby here\n\nPeople saying NTA are missing the fact that your sibling is allowed to be upset about dead naming. \n\nHowever, I make mistakes all the time, misgender nonbinary friends, and I'm enby myself. Quick adjust and move on. People make mistakes, absolutely, and that's OK within reason, but the other person is still allowed to be upset, especially if it's continual.", "Gonna go with soft YTA.    \n    \nFrom your comments, it does sound like you want to use the right pronouns and the right name. That being said, there's something which you specifically mentioned: your sibling's initial gender identity.

I would sit with that and think about why. ~~Additionally, consider this: given that your sibling *is* your twin, if you're closer than the rest of your family that may be why they're more upset with you than with others for deadnaming them.~~     \n    \nEdit: removed and/or crossed out the parts about being a twin, I misread that somehow, that's on me.", "Nta she just changed her name people slip up no one is perfect", "INFO: how often do you slip your mind and call them by their deadname?", "YTA, you can't even gender them properly in a post you can edit.

Fuck the people getting triggered by a name", "NTA- its still new to everyone and they will have to be patient with you too. Our daughter changed her name when she thought she was transgender. We did our best and slipped sometimes but always apologized. She kept the name but decided she wasn\u2019t male but somewhere in between. I still sometimes slip when I am remembering her as a little one but usually not when she\u2019s there. Funny how memories work.\n\nThat said, my coworker transitioned about a year after she started on my team. I\u2019d been really conscientious of using her new name until a couple of months ago, her deadname just dropped out of my mouth during a meeting. I immediately stumbled as if I\u2019d meant someone else and then apologized via PM. The only reason I can think of was that I was thinking of something that they\u2019d told me before they transitioned and my brain farted. They were very gracious and accepted my apology. This is several years post-transitioning. So slip ups happen without being an asshole.", "I mean, I get that you're adjusting, but you need to work harder on it. Of course they're going to be annoyed and correct you when you get it wrong, that doesn't make them an asshole. The fact that you need more than two weeks to fully adjust doesn't make you an asshole either. \n\nI'm interested in how you react to slipping up and deadnaming your sibling, though.", "i don\u2019t know if i\u2019d go as far as to say you\u2019re the asshole but i think you should be putting in the effort to internalize your sibling\u2019s identity. a big part of adjusting to a loved one coming out as trans is not to memorize what they want to be called, but to internalize the way they view themselves as the way you view them. it can be hard but it\u2019ll improve your relationship in the long run", "N T A for occasionally slipping up on the name, if you were not undermining the in other ways. I've occasionally slipped up on the names or pronouns  of trans people, and they've waved it off as they could see it was an honest mistake in a pattern of supportive behaviour. \n\nBut given the way you refer to them as \"starting to think they were trans\" and your use of female pronouns later in your post (\"her birth name\") the \"slip\" fits into a broader pattern of unsupportive behaviour.

It is great you are trying but using their dead name isn't okay.

No one should expect you to not make mistakes every now and then, that\u2019s completely unreasonable.\n\n It\u2019s understandable for your sibling to be hurt when you accidentally call them by their birth name or use the wrong pronouns, but early on in the transition process, that is going to happen. \n\nI was always forgiving with my family about names and pronouns, and still am. And it\u2019s been two and a half years since I\u2019ve been out of the closet!

What i used to do was to always correct myself out loud. Always use her pronouns and name as often as possible and also keep repeating her name in my mind whenever i wasn't doing anything.

I hope OP sees your comment because this is the appropriate way.", "Also OP misgendered their sibling for like half the post...it's not hard to say \"my sibling identified as female\" (AFAB assigned female at birth would be more correct but not everybody knows that term immediately) \"but came out as non-binary, they\" etc etc etc.    \n   \n(Edit: removed the twin part that my brain decided to invent about this post for no apparent reason at all)", "[deleted]", "So sorry, I forgot to add something into the post that has to do with the gender they were assigned at birth, I also do not see where I said they are my twin I am 2 years older than them", "They were told by another comment to put AFAB", "For the love of god, take three seconds to not misgender a trans person on a post about misgendering a trans person", "Maybe one or twice a week not very often, I\u2019ve called them by their birth name around 4 times in the few weeks they\u2019ve had their new name", "I\u2019ve fixed it now, thanks for letting me know", "\"Of course they're going to be annoyed\" No, actually that's pretty rude and unfair. \n\nIt makes them an asshole to get openly annoyed, it's unreasonable to get annoyed at this stage in the name change. I corrected people politely and calmly when I changed my name. People had known me years, I was patient with them and politely corrected them when they called me the wrong name. The only time I got mad was if someone was clearly doing it to be rude and were doing it on purpose. My own mother still sometimes slips up and calls me my old name on occasion, I am not going to go off the handle at her, she's known me by my old name a LOT longer than my new name. Correcting politely and not getting annoyed is the best policy if the person is clearly making an honest mistake. I'm personally terrible with names and will mix up people's names that aren't even going through a name change (I've called my own dad the wrong name on a few occasions), so it's pretty unfair to get annoyed at someone when the name change is so recent.", "Yeah no- if someone has had the same name for your whole life and it suddenly changes, you'll slip up. Most people will slip up. It's called being human.", "I\u2019ve been calling them their birth name for 24 years, it\u2019s only been about 2 weeks since the change and the rest of the family has messed up much more than me but my sibling get upset at me. Thanks for your input though", "Thanks for your reply! I\u2019ll be trying this now", "Same, I call my kids each others names all the time accidentally and ultimately I\u2019m just like \u201cwhat\u2019s your name, come here\u201d because it\u2019s like a roll call in my house \ud83d\ude06", "I disagree NTA they also have an adjustment period and they are doing their best. Their sibling seems to have a supportive family but they have unrealistic expectations if they think everyone is going to adjust at the drop of a hat.", "Yeah my grandfather has a ton of grandkids and three of them (me and my two cousins) are all girls born within the same year. I\u2019ve been confused by my cousins\u2019 names basically since I was born", "My grandmother calls me by my mother's name (we look exactly alike) or by my sister's name (sounds similar to mine) all the time. Been going on for almost 30 years. She wasn't senile at first, and my grandmother has only seen my sister a handful of times during all of this (long story, they both suck). Being called my mom's name never bothered me, but I could never understand why I got called by my sister's since they literally never spoke. \n\nIn regards to OPs situation, creating new habits can be hard especially with people you live with. It really sounds like OP isn't doing it on purpose, but even accidents hurt people. My nephew is a transman but I only see him a few times a year. The first visit after he had picked out his preferred name, a few days before and the day of I went through pictures of him on my phone and social media. Including photos him prior and current, and said his name out loud as I went. I wanted it to be instinctual.\nI have slipped up twice in the 7 years since, thankfully not in his presence, and I immediately corrected myself. \n\nHopefully, it helps, if not OP then someone else who is experiencing a similar situation", "My entire side of the family mix up my son and my brother\u2019s names. They\u2019re 30 years apart but they look alike and have a similar temperament so we still manage to confuse them.", "That wasn't exactly my point. It was more the \"started thinking\" part that I was referring to. That's undermining.\n\nTo address the misgendering, are you sure \"they\" is what you should have corrected it to? That's not meant to be an accusation, but are you sure your sibling wouldn't prefer \"He and Him\" rather than \"They and Their\"?", "I\u2019ve fixed that now, thanks for reminding me", "Nonbinary is within the trans umbrella.", "You're correct on the twin part, that's my mistake.", "Thanks, the AFAB part was also important to an other part of the story I added in after so help people with their responses.", "It's less the AFAB term and more the mentioning of their sibling's previous gender at all. I'm the one who made that comment before thinking on it further and wondering why it was there in the first place.", "Because thats such a big crime? Ppl make mistakes\u2026", "honestly NAH because it's an accident and you actively try not to mess up. it's ok to not be used to it, but please try to not slip up again. it is offensive and insensitive to refer to someone by their deadname.\n\nit's also ok to be bothered about it so your sibling is also not in the wrong.", "I mean you sound really insensitive about the whole thing. Using the wrong pronouns in your first edit, saying something like \"they started thinking they were trans\" ... it's all really dismissive and your sibling I'm sure can read right through it.", "How do you react when you realize you've said the wrong name?\n\nHow do you react when they correct you?\n\nHow do your other family members react when they misgender your sibling?\n\nEveryone slips up now and then, that happens.\n\nThe way you respond when called out is what makes it clear if it was just a slip up, or if you don't respect their identity.\n\nWhen you're corrected, don't get defensive.\n\nThe person correcting you (if it's another family member/friend) is doing you a favor by reminding you of the correct name/pronouns.\n\nIf the person correcting you is your sibling, then they're correcting you because they want you to be a part of their life, so they're putting in the time, effort, and emotional energy to help you remember their name and pronouns.\n\nWhen you're corrected, or as soon as you realize you said the wrong name or pronoun, simply *say **the right** name/pronoun* and *move on.*\n\nYou don't need to apologize other than a quick \"sorry, I meant they/[their name]\".\n\nYou don't need to explain anything. You don't need to tell them how hard it is to remember a new name after knowing them as [deadname] for so long. You don't need to convince them if how hard you're trying.\n\nWhen you do those things, you're making it about *you*, and you're putting the blame on *them* for being \"difficult\".\n\n\"I asked Nora -- I mean Brick, and they said...\"\n\n\"I asked Nora--\"\n\"Brick\"\n\"Yes, thank you -- I asked Brick and they said...\"\n\nPractice using their new name and pronouns in your head. Sit there, thinking about them, and use their correct name and pronouns.\n\nI have very black and white thinking (thanks, mental illnesses!) so wrapping my head around nonbinary genders is hard, because it breaks the boxes I'm used to. But that's a ME problem, not a them problem. I have to put in the work on my own to make a new box in my brain for \"nonbinary.\"\n\nIt sounds like you still see your sibling as \"girl\"; just \"girl with new name who wants to use these pronouns for now.\"\n\nYour sibling is not a girl. Your sibling is a nonbinary person. A nonbinary person named [their name], not \"my sister, named [deadname], who wants people to call her [\"new name\"].\n\nAs others have pointed out, you wrote a whole post about your sibling coming out at nonbinary and you misgendered them throughout the post -- because you haven't accepted in your head that your sibling is not female.\n\nYou're looking at their name and pronouns as something new to call them, not as *who they **are**.*", "A month is quite a long time given they have said they got it done multiple times a week.

No one is undermining anyone, you are trying to stir the pot to make a point that only you seem to think is present.", "To me it\u2019s a bit weird to misgender someone you don\u2019t know and have been told about exclusively in the context of them being trans and NOT using she/her pronouns. Like yeah obviously people make mistakes, but that\u2019s usually when either you\u2019ve visually seen a person and then used the pronouns you assumed fit, or when you actually know the person in question and you\u2019ve slipped up and used pronouns they used to, but no longer, use. So it feels a bit disrespectful when it takes less than a second to make sure you read the post right and not continue the misgendering of OP\u2019s sibling.", "When I said they started thinking I meant they hadn\u2019t decided yet, and about the wrong pronouns it\u2019s was a simple mistake, all the other time I\u2019ve text people about them I\u2019ve called them a her, it\u2019s only been a few weeks and I\u2019m trying as hard as I can", "A month is nothing. I\u2019ve been with my partner for over 20 years and they still accidentally call me the name of whoever happens to be visiting at the time. Slip ups happen.", "I see, thank you for the clarification.\n\nI do still believe that the \"started thinking they were trans\" statement was undermining.\n\nEdit: I'm apparently bad at reading. I see what you were saying now. It's a bit of a clumsy way of phrasing it, but I get the context now. I retract what I said.", "I can see how a slip up would happen when speaking, but when you type out a paragraph wherein the very topic is about you deadnaming them, and how they're nonbinary? Can you see why it seems like you're not really taking them seriously?", "Multiple times a week?", "I mean, to me it just reads as \"they knew they weren't cis but didn't know in which direction\" but like. Worded by someone who doesn't quite get it.", "This hits the nail on the head of why this post was bugging me. Because yes, slip-ups happen. Yes, OP's sibling has been using the new name and pronouns for a relatively short amount of time.
