I told her no and went to leave the room. She then got out of bed and started screaming and demanding I do it like mom and that she wanted her mom to do it and why she couldn\u2019t mom be here to do it. I lost my temper and screamed at her no and that her mom isn\u2019t here anymore and she needs to accept it and stop acting like a baby. I slammed her door and went down to the  living room to cool off, and when I was heading to bed, I could hear her sobbing through the door, but I decided to just let her be. \n\nThe morning I called my MIL to come take Clara off my hands for awhile, as I was putting her suitcase in the trunk of my MIL's car, I noticed her favorite teddy bear wasn\u2019t there, I ran back into the house to go get it for her. I came back out and tried giving her the teddy bear, but she completely ignored me and wouldn\u2019t take it. \n\nLater, my neighbor Jim (52 m) came over and asked to borrow my lawnmower.

WTF would you think she doesn't understand the situation and is \"acting out for the sake of doing so.\" She is a young HUMAN BEING not a cat knocking water glasses off the counter or a dog eating your shoes. Did YOU have a brain and thoughts and understandings when you were a child? Or when did you suddenly morph into being a person with a rich inner life? Did it magically happen at 12? 16? 18? Surely, 8 is too young to have any idea what's going on, she's clearly just a thoughtless attention seeking puppet. JEEZ. NO THAT'S NOT HOW HUMAN BEINGING WORKS. \n\nYou daughter is a small human being who lost her mother and now her father is behaving like an absolute soulless jerk to her.

Get some therapy (and definitely some for your daughter), seriously, said with all the compassion in the world-- doubly so that you'd post this here as a \"am I right\" vs in a sub for grieving children or something.", "YTA. Be an understanding father to her. She needs your support and your care now.", "Yes, YTA for sure. Why on earth did you refuse to tuck her teddy bear in with her?\n\nScreaming at her was a bad choice. Children often regress when something major changes in their lives. It's your job to take a step back when you see this behavior and respond calmly like an adult. Encourage other ways of expressing her unhappiness besides the tantrums, and discourage the tantrums. Read some books to get ideas, consult a child development specialist, make a plan of action for when these tricky situations come up.", "Major YTA. \n\nShe's a child who's also grieving her mother's passing. The least you could've done was offer her comfort by appeasing her request about the teddy bear. I don't understand why you're confused about her ignoring you, she has every right to be upset. Grief doesn't justify snapping at your young daughter like that. It could be good for you to seek help to cope with this and support your daughter as well.", "YTA\n\nFirst off, sorry for your loss\n\nThat being said, however difficult this is for you, it\u2019s gotta be far more difficult for her. You\u2019re a grown adult with the ability to rationalize your grief, she doesn\u2019t have that luxury. She needs a parent who she can rely on for her emotional needs, and that duty is falling to you now. \n\nHow long would it take to tuck in a teddy bear? 10 seconds? Why is it that big a deal for you to not have to do it?", "First, I'm so sorry for your and Clara's loss. You are both grieving and what happens reflects that.\n\nBut YTA here. You seem to expect Clara to process grief the same way you are, or at least at an adult level. It's not gonna happen. You are the only parent she has now and you need to help her through this. That means putting your grief aside in favor of dealing with hers. At least in a situational sense, like the one you described here. What she needed was her teddy bear and a hug. She needed to have a safe, soft space to land and someone to understand she's hurting. And yes, I know you need those things too, but you're the adult here and have more resources and experience than she does. She needed YOU and instead she got yelled at and ignored. \n\nYou can repair this. I hope you are getting some help in processing your own grief as well as getting equipped with tools you can use in helping Clara process hers. Until you get a starting grip on this, Clara staying with grandma might be a good idea. But don't let it go too long. Little girls need daddy, especially when momma is gone.\n\nAgain, so sorry for your loss and I hope you can navigate through the grief together with Clara.", "Asshole! Asshole! Asshole! Why the hell couldn\u2019t you tuck her in with the toy like her mum did!?!?!? \n\nMy GOD you\u2019re not fit to be a parent! I was raised by a mum like you. I speak from experience. \n\nAsshole!!!!!", "YTA. She absolutely understands that her mother is dead. She's throwing tantrums and acting out because at 8 years old she understands death but has no actual way to deal with it. She literally does not have those coping skills like adults are supposed to. She now also understands that her dad thinks she's a baby, that she needs to grow up (even though she's only 8 years old and shouldnt be expected to do that at all), and that he's not a safe person to find comfort in. Congrats on fucking up your child! You lost a wife dude, but she has now lost both of her parents. \nGet your shit together. Seek therapy. And spend the rest of your life trying to make this up to your daughter because there is no way to accurately say how much you have fucked this up. \n\nAlso, why the fuck did you refuse to tuck her in with her doll? It would have taken like 30 seconds. Jesus Christ dude. You both need therapy really badly.", "YTA even from the first step. A child asked for a bear when you were tucking her in... why did you say no? Are you completely unaware of what raising a kid entails because wife did everything? Then we add all the deceased mother and emotionally abusive dad stuff and phew boy.\n\nThere are so many issues in this post it almost seems made to elicite rage.", "Children typically develop a concept of death as a permanent process that can\u2019t be reversed at around the age of 6.

You are hurting her.", "Awww YTA . The little girl just lost her mother . She is confused grieving and feeling uncertain  . She wanted a bit of familiarity and security and you didn\u2019t give it to her . Not only that but when she was upset you shouted at her and that\u2019s intimidating for a child making her more insecure and uncertain . Then rather than reassure her when she was sobbing alone you just abandoned her to her distress . She\u2019s only 8 years old . A child , not a mini adult . She\u2019s not acting out ! It\u2019s all perfectly normal age appropriate behavior for a child who has just lost their mother . You have a lot of work to do otherwise you will lose her too. She will be no contact soon as she is able . Kids remember this stuff you know ? It burns into their memory . I\u2019m sorry for your loss but you are still a parent and the only parent she has left . Do better", "I\u2019m sorry you lost your wife but your 8 year old child lost her mother.

That is cruel and disgusting.  \n\nYou hug your child, tell her you love her and that you\u2019re still here, you absolutely DO NOT shout at her and tell her her mother\u2019s not here anymore.\n\nTo top it all off you ship her off to your mother in laws.  You should be ashamed of yourself. Go get your god damn daughter, beg for forgiveness and sort your shit out!!!\n\nYTA \n\nYou are failing spectacularly at being a father.

You can barely deal with this and you are upset your 8 year old is having difficulty with it.", "Yes, YTA.\n\nI\u2019m extremely sorry for your loss, and I can only imagine how unimaginably crushing it must be. And that also goes for your little girl who has lost her mother. And she\u2019s a child at a remarkably sensitive and influential time in her life, a time when she desperately needs love and parenting and care, but instead has this vacuum of pain, and loneliness, and confusion, and existential crises that you probably aren\u2019t even aware of.\n\nYou also have to deal with some or all of those things, but you get the tremendous benefit of doing so as an adult. It would be a mistake to believe that this automatically means you feel that loss more acutely, or that even if that were the case that this would be a reason for behaving this way with her.\n\nYou can\u2019t bring your wife back, you can\u2019t bring her mother back, but you can love that girl, and you can make sure she knows that her mother is still very much a part of her, a part of her life, and that she can take that love with her everywhere she goes in life.\n\nThere\u2019s probably nothing more profound and important that we can do as men and as fathers.", "YTA you suck op she will go no contact with you in 10 years", "I get what you\u2019re going through, but you\u2019re definitely wrong.

You are grieving so I am going to chalk it up as a mistake but it was cruel.  8 years old and dealing with the loss of her mother,  you two should be consoling each other.

I can understand the outburst you had at her - you're suffering too, and no doubt Clara's tantrum pushed a few buttons.

You should have taken that moment to apologise after calming down. To explain that you are both hurting, and that it's ok to be sad. At the very least, to not let your daughter go to sleep thinking her father hates her - because that's how kids usually rationalise things to extremes. \n\nPlease apologise to your daughter, genuinely and sincerely.

Of course YTA. \n\nYour daughters behaviour is age and situation appropriate. Yours? Not so much. \n\nI\u2019m sorry you lost your wife, but as an adult you have at least experience of what death means. A parent being gone is a *existential threat* to a child! Because a child is entirely dependent upon their parent for not only their emotional wellbeing, but for their very survival. They are hard wired to feel that threat for the existential threat that it is.\n\nYour daughter isn\u2019t acting out for the sake of it. She is trying to find reassurance that you aren\u2019t going to disappear too. She\u2019s trying to get your attention - likely reinforced because you are acting like such a YTA. Because you are so busy drowning in your grief and unable to see past yourself that she recognises even the parent still with her isn\u2019t present with her. \n\nIf you can\u2019t handle your grief, how the hell do you expect a child of eight years old to handle it? I\u2019d be a lot more understanding of your outburst if you hadn\u2019t ignored your daughters pain when you went to bed yourself. Has it occurred to you that means she was alone, crying for her mother *for bloody hours?!* and you ignored her as punishment because you were in pain. \n\nThat\u2019s not even just YTA. That\u2019s proper tosser behaviour that is. Get yourself and your daughter some grief therapy - because you are clearly drowning and you are taking your daughter down with you.  \n\nThis incident will be a core memory for your daughter. You\u2019ve dismissed her legitimate pain. You\u2019ve told her that missing her mother is childish. Your actions have encouraged she not express her grief, thereby setting her up for years of yet more pain. You have made a child responsible for the grief that is yours to carry. You are a total wanker. Fix it", "Are you ok? Are you getting any help with processing your grief? Losing a spouse is traumatic, and nobody should have to process that alone\n\nI think you should find a therapist if you haven\u2019t already to help you with this.

These past few months, Clara has been really difficult to deal with; she often throws temper tantrums anytime we go out or whenever I ask her to do something.\n\u00a0\nYesterday night I was putting Clara to bed and she demanded I tuck her favorite teddy bear into bed like her mom does. I told her no and went to leave the room. She then got out of bed and started screaming and demanding I do it like mom and that she wanted her mom to do it and why she couldn\u2019t mom be here to do it. I lost my temper and screamed at her no and that her mom isn\u2019t here anymore and she needs to accept it and stop acting like a baby. I slammed her door and went down to the \nliving room to cool off, and when I was heading to bed, I could hear her sobbing through the door, but I decided to just let her be.\n\u00a0\nThe morning I called my MIL to come take Clara off my hands for awhile, as I was putting her suitcase in the trunk of my MIL's car, I noticed her favorite teddy bear wasn\u2019t there, I ran back into the house to go get it for her. I came back out and tried giving her the teddy bear, but she completely ignored me and wouldn\u2019t take it. \n\nLater, my neighbor Jim (52 m) came over and asked to borrow my lawnmower. I thought since he has kids himself, he would understand my point of view. He said what I did was a dumb move, and Clara is struggling too. I don\u2019t think Clara quite understands what\u2019s happening and is deciding to act out for the sake of doing so but AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "I'm so sorry for your loss, but yes, YTA here. It's good that Clara has been moved to a different environment for now, as you are unable to help her at this time. Honestly, you both need some therapy and grief counseling. This isn't something that either of you can just \"get over\", and you both need some help trying to navigate all these feelings.", "Well, we know who is going to burn in hell for all eternity. OP.\n\nYTA. The damage you are doing to that poor little girl is immeasurable. Leave her with her grandmother so she can receive the comfort, love and care she deserves.", "I am gonna give you benefit of a doubt and say NAH (but slightly YTA). I also lost my dad when I was 6, so I kinda have a knowledge on the topic. So:\n1. Your daughter doesn't understand. She probably gets concept of death at 8, but kids don't have same perception as adults. \n2. Both you and her need therapy. It's a lot to manage, you are both grieving and you are clearly not able to manage your emotions. \n3. Her tantrums and a way to release the tension, she doesn't know what to do with everything she feels, she has no copying mechanism. It's clear that your tantrums source from the same. But here is your asshole part - you are an adult. You are responsible for managing the situation. Run to therapy. You cannot take it out on your child. \n4. Believe me, she will remember how you managed the situation. You may think that pushing through her rejecting you is too much, but through that she will learn you will always be there for her, when mom can't. \n5. On a side note, be there on every important occasion for her. Don't skip school meetings, birthdays, graduations etc because you need to work or something. She will appreciate it more than money.\n\nI feel really sorry for you and your daughter.", "I want to say Y T A, because man you screwed up, but NAH. You're in one of the toughest places a person can be, following the place your daughter finds herself in closely. You must never take it out on her again, for both of your sakes. You really need to apologize and show her that what you did was not okay.", "You are absolutely NTA, but that doesn't mean it wasn't an asshole move.\n\nYou are grieving and have less control over your emotions and you deserve a break when you misstep. \n\nBut so does your daughter. \n\nYou best move is to go to her, hold her, comfort her, perhaps cry with her. Do it now.", "YTA she IS a child  YOU are the adult  act like it", "No shit Sherlock she can't compartmentalize like an adult because she's 8 years old. At 8 you still think your parents are sorta invincible still and yet her *loving* mother just died. She doesn't know how to really deal with a big loss properly yet. \n\nYou are her only parent now. You have to take up both dad ***and mom*** roles now for her sake. Yes you should've just tucked in that teddy bear. It was a small request from your child you supposedly love that would've taken less than 30 seconds to do anyways.\n\nYTA and actually be the parent she needs.", "YTA. Do you think because she is 8, she is not capable of grieving?  She wants her mom.  What she needs and so do you I'd to get into bereavement counseling. They have specific groups for those who have lost a parent.  \n\nHave you given any thought to your MIL?  She just lost her daughter.  I know you are devastated and angry and grieving but you still need to be a dad to your daughter.", "YTA. \n\nI get that you're also grieving the loss of your wife, I am very sorry for that. \n\nBut your DAUGHTER is grieving the loss of her mother and she is EIGHT YEARS OLD. Children don't process emotion and can have more difficulty regulating themselves. \n\nYour daughter is acting out BECAUSE HER MOTHER DIED. \n\nOF COURSE your daughter doesn't understand what is happening because she is 8 years old. She is a little girl who wants her mom and cannot have her mom because her mom is dead. She is trying to process that AND deal with a father who is so focused on himself that he is ACTIVELY damaging his relationship with her. \n\nGet yourself AND your daughter in to grief counselling, like yesterday.

There isn't a YTA big enough for you.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSHE LOST HER MOM.  Let that sink in.  SHE LOST HER MOTHER.  You're an adult that's struggling with the loss of a spouse.

She\u2019s letting you know that she wants to continue some of the traditions she shared with your wife, as a way to keep her memory alive. It sounds like that\u2019s painful for you, but you need to find ways to support her. Together, the two of you can make some new traditions alongside the ones she wants to keep. Are either of you in therapy? You sound like you need someone to talk to, and she would benefit too. My judgement is YTA, but this is much bigger than that.

It is completely unfair for you to treat her in such a way. \n\nNow all that being said, you are also going through some really hard stuff right now and it is clear that you guys probably could both benefit with some therapy. I don't think you are meaning to be, but you are being very cruel to your daughter. Would somebody screaming in your face right now telling you to get over the loss of your wife help you get over it? How's that going to help your 8 year old little girl who is reeling from her emotions?\n\nTo nobody's surprise after reading this, I'm going to say YTA.

I\u2019m sorry for your loss, second of all. \n\nBut most of all, an 8 year old child is _not_ a baby. She fully understands that her mother is dead and will not be coming back. She is completely grief stricken and craving the things her mother did for her that gave her comfort. You are not only denying these very simple acts of compassion and kindness to your daughter (tuck in the fucking teddy bear), but you\u2019re adding additional trauma to an already _incredibly_ traumatic situation for a child by making it very clear that you, her dad, will never give her the same type of love her mom did, will never even try to fill the void she\u2019s feeling having lost her mother, and will scream at her to grow the fuck up when she\u2019s feeling deeply lost and upset by this massive hole in her heart. The very least you could\u2019ve done was apologize, explain your grief, and offer her a hug or cuddle when you heard her _sobbing_. But you chose the path of least resistance and let her mourn alone. Again. \n\nYou\u2019re such a GD AH in this situation, it\u2019s hard to comprehend how you could ever think otherwise.

I get what you were doing...\nShe's 8.  And apparently, this is what her mom was doing for her.  Tucking her teddy bear in with her.  \n\nI can understand you're feeling like maybe this is a babyish thing.  Like sure, she can have her teddy bear in bed with her, but tucking it in too?  Nah, that's too babyish even for an 8yo.... Honestly that is a thought that I would have. \n\nHowever, this is a bad time with the loss of her mom.  You are both grieving.  And if it helps her feel better to have you tucking her in the same way her mom used to, which includes the bear, then what's the harm in that? \n\nI think you owe her a huge apology... Explain where your mind is too with your emotion and grieving, and that it's no excuse, but it just happened because you're struggling too.  And let her know you'll be happy to tuck Teddy in with her for a while.  At some point, when she's a little older, maybe start phasing it out, but for now, Teddy gets a tuck! \n\nSo sorry for your loss.", "Soft YTA. \n\nThis is so painful to read. Your poor daughter. Everyone who says she\u2019ll be processing it in therapy forever is probably right. That\u2019s the YTA part. This is absolutely harming your child, bigtime. \n\nAnd - I\u2019m sure you are suffering immensely here. Grief makes us do crazy things. Let this be a wake up call. You need to take care of yourself and get yourself help so you can care for your child. You CANNOT do this sort of thing to her again. \n\nYou absolutely need to do something to try to repair the relationship. Apologize. Full mea culpa. Express the vulnerable emotions you\u2019re having - model feeling sadness for her, remorse for hurting her, all of that. Not as an excuse.

Your daughter asked to be tucked in with a particular toy and you said NO?!?! WHY?!?!

Please talk to her, make sure she understands what death actually is, that you miss your wife too, and that you're both hurting and sometimes people say and do the wrong things when they're hurting. Apologize for losing your temper. If you have the ability in any way, get counseling for the both of you. Her mother's death can screw her up for years to come all on its own, please don't add to it. This isn't something she can just 'accept', she has to come to terms with it and it will take time, lots of it. And the grief will flare up many times over her years growing up and over her lifetime in general. Be the solid ground she needs for those times. Keep reminders of her mom around (always).

Not related to church but I went through what many do wondering did mom know I loved her? Did she ever forgive me for doing (enter long list of stupid kid things I did). I also recognized others were grieving and things were not the same at ALL. Mom was gone, people were acting different, my regular day to day things (think tucking in the teddy bear) were screwed up. I lost waaaay more than my mom. I lost many family members - at least for awhile - when she died.

It is your job to help her process this in a way that\u2019s healthy for you both and try to come to terms with this enormous loss. \n\nOne of the stages of grief is bargaining, and how that can sometimes look is \u201cif I do this, I\u2019ll feel better.\u201d And it\u2019s not hard to picture that a little girl in her bed, missing her mother, would think that maybe if dad tucked me and teddy in just the way mum did I will feel a bit better about everything tonight. \nInstead you pushed away her attempt at asking for support, you met her grief-motivated reaction and questions with massive anger and then threw it back in her face that she doesn\u2019t have a mother anymore and she needs to get over it and grow up. You literally bungled every single step of this. \n\nMy husband passed away 3 weeks ago now, and just this week my son (9) fell over and scrapped himself.

Once he was calm, he sadly leant into my shoulder and said \u201cbut I don\u2019t have the daddy magic to fix it.\u201d And we sat there and we just spoke about how wonderful his dad was and how WE will find a way through this together. \nNotice, I didn\u2019t scream, I didn\u2019t throw my hands up and give up.

I am very sorry you went through that.", "This sounds horrific at any age, but especially a young one. I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019ve had to go through that.", "His grief doesn't erase what this is doing to his daughter. If I'm hurt and I hurt another adult, I'm still the AH but it's not as bad. But this child just lost her MOTHER, and instead of helping her grieve and understanding her pain, he yells at her. He makes her feel like her pain is not only unnecessary, but actually ANNOYING. She's EIGHT! If he as a grown man can't process his grief, how tf is she supposed to? Honestly I know he's going through it, but this is borderline abuse to me.

His first priority must be his child and he is massively failing her.", "Definitely don\u2019t. The name alone sends shivers down my spine. True crime has probably ruined any chance I have of living without anxiety lol", "The path of least harm for both parties.

Just let people enjoy things.", "Yeah, I made a small jump to asking how involved he was pre-death because the way the post is worded, but leaping to straight up shitty parenting because of the sex of the child was a leap! I was mostly asking because it seems like he didn\u2019t have a set routine with the daughter yet, which means mom likely did all the bedtimes. If this is the case the acting out is very understandable and he\u2019s being very cavalier about why she\u2019s acting out and not giving proper respect to the fact that the most important person in her world who literally took care of her is gone and now there\u2019s the backup who doesn\u2019t know how bedtime works. He lost his wife, she lost her world.", "Just possibly?", "I'm not. I'm going by the behaviors he presented here and his neglect of his daughter's emotions by trying to treat her like an unruly boy.", "No, but nice try. I wonder why you thought it was a projection. But it's really none of my business why you do or do not think that way. Anyway, I'm busy trying to deal with a confused mama cat who thinks her babies are going in the small space under my dresser, and three one week old kittens. I hope you have a nice day.", "If that's the worst take you've ever seen them maybe you should try talking to people every now and then. You might learn something new about how people are. That being said, I said what I said and I stand by it. I'm also not going to resort to calling other people stupid just to make myself feel better. Also, it's 2023 but there are still men who think that girls aren't as important as boys, and legacies, and blah blah.  From what OP said in this post that's how he sounds to me.

He didn't tuck her in and then he yelled at her. If his daughter had been a boy he probably would've been more involved and not had a problem. Why?

And from what he wrote it didn't seem like it to me, although with more info I might or might not be proven wrong. We have what they provided and we're supposed to render a judgement so the poster can feel validated or not about the situation. You and I have both made judgements based on the few paragraphs they've provided and any other knowledge we've acquired in life or through reading that we believe is relevant. Making a judgement that you don't agree with is not outrageous simply because you don't agree with it. I certainly don't think your judgement about me is outrageous simply because we disagree. We just have different views."]}
