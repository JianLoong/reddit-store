Your nephew is clearly still hurt by your decision to not keep teaching him piano, and you rubbed salt in the wound for him as an adult by telling him he was untalented.\n\nI'm guessing you're not very talented at teaching. Not everyone learns at the same pace or in the same way, and in your ignorance, you harmed a child's experience with art.", "YTA.\n\nDifferent people learn at different rates. You obviously played favorites here because Sean wasn't learning as quickly as you wanted.

I don\u2019t think teaching is for you, you affect young lives when you teach and if you write people off because you lack patience then you\u2019re not fit to be a teacher.", "Yta- though I half suspect the reason he was slower was because he didn\u2019t practice. Judging from my own lessons in piano that seems highly likely\u2026. The kids who came to session very slow often didn\u2019t practice that week, which means you are there as the teacher essentially running a practice session. I don\u2019t mind doing that if I\u2019m paid, but for free lessons I\u2019m not going to sit and put you through drills you could have easily done at home. either way, the way you expressed to your nephew why you stopped was rude and belittling.", "YTA.

He also only graduated from highschool at 21 and his marks weren't great enough to get into Uni.\n\nHe's in his late 40s now and he just graduated with a cum laude from law school and he speaks 5 languages. \nJust because someone is slow doesn't mean they aren't talented or don't have the capacity to learn.", "YTA  I would give anything to have a talent that my nephew wanted me to teach him. To spend that quality time with this person who means so much to me, man! That would have been so special.\nEven if he wasn't very good at it, that time together would be precious and build a bond, and memories, for both our lives. \nIf your time and talent mean more to you than all that, you need to rethink your relationship and priorities.\nI love my nephew, and 2 nieces, beyond measure. Any bonding time with them is a gift.

Making an assumption here, but if you\u2019re excepting kids to be great automatically, you\u2019re not a good teacher, you\u2019re a good student poacher. GREAT teachers, Instructors, and coaches can take kids with minimal talent, and pull it out of them.

You should quit.\" I did quit, and never touched a musical instrument again, until a few years ago (I'm old now). In learning guitar, I found out that the joy of playing an instrument has nothing to do with 'talent.' I will never be great at this, but I wish now I hadn't listened to that teacher, because there's a lot of pleasure to be had just from making music, however slowly and imperfectly. Telling someone they have no talent and are therefore not worth your time makes you the AH for sure.
