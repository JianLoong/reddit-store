Your nephew is clearly still hurt by your decision to not keep teaching him piano, and you rubbed salt in the wound for him as an adult by telling him he was untalented.\n\nI'm guessing you're not very talented at teaching. Not everyone learns at the same pace or in the same way, and in your ignorance, you harmed a child's experience with art.", "YTA.\n\nDifferent people learn at different rates. You obviously played favorites here because Sean wasn't learning as quickly as you wanted.

I don\u2019t think teaching is for you, you affect young lives when you teach and if you write people off because you lack patience then you\u2019re not fit to be a teacher.", "Yta- though I half suspect the reason he was slower was because he didn\u2019t practice. Judging from my own lessons in piano that seems highly likely\u2026. The kids who came to session very slow often didn\u2019t practice that week, which means you are there as the teacher essentially running a practice session. I don\u2019t mind doing that if I\u2019m paid, but for free lessons I\u2019m not going to sit and put you through drills you could have easily done at home. either way, the way you expressed to your nephew why you stopped was rude and belittling.", "YTA.

He also only graduated from highschool at 21 and his marks weren't great enough to get into Uni.\n\nHe's in his late 40s now and he just graduated with a cum laude from law school and he speaks 5 languages. \nJust because someone is slow doesn't mean they aren't talented or don't have the capacity to learn.", "YTA  I would give anything to have a talent that my nephew wanted me to teach him. To spend that quality time with this person who means so much to me, man!

Any bonding time with them is a gift.

Making an assumption here, but if you\u2019re excepting kids to be great automatically, you\u2019re not a good teacher, you\u2019re a good student poacher. GREAT teachers, Instructors, and coaches can take kids with minimal talent, and pull it out of them.

In learning guitar, I found out that the joy of playing an instrument has nothing to do with 'talent.'

Telling someone they have no talent and are therefore not worth your time makes you the AH for sure.

You didn\u2019t even sound like u tried with him at all, u just expected him to be a natural at it. YTA!", "YTA-  \n\nAs a music teacher with a masters degree and 10 years of experience\u2026 holy moly YTA. Talent isn\u2019t even really a thing. It\u2019s the effort put in by the individual. Sure some things are easier to pick up for some people than others but you can\u2019t determine someone\u2019s trajectory after a few lessons. \n\nI hope you don\u2019t teach piano to other people. Think of how many children you\u2019ve caused to *hate* music because of this harsh and backwards thinking.", "Probably NTA. There\u2019s just not enough info for me to decide. \n\nIn all cases,\nTalent = practice \n\nLove, desire, and passion for playing music is what motivates effort and drives one to put in the practice time.  Sure, long fingers for a fret board or a lack of emphysema with a wind instrument and some other things can factor into it, \n\nBut there is a direct and proportional relationship between quality and quantity of practice time and the amount of \u201ctalent\u201d that one has on the piano.  \n\n\nOP wasn\u2019t a professional teacher and the kid wanted free lessons.  It is very likely he was a \u201cslow learner\u201d because he didn\u2019t have the passionate drive to repeatedly practice what was shown to him.  The kazoo is the only easy instrument.  Kid didn\u2019t want the kazoo but likely didn\u2019t want to work hard at getting good on the piano.  \n\nIt sounds to me like it is likely that the kid admired his aunt\u2019s skill and imagined she could bestow her \u201ctalent\u201d upon him magically.  If he didn\u2019t opt for lessons from another teacher then it probably wasn\u2019t really about the piano for him.", "YTA - Only because of your response. You could have explained to him that it was harder for you at the time instead of straight up insulting him.", "Maybe saying that you just didn't have a lot of patience back then would have been fine. But you added that he didn't have much talent in it to his face. Ummmm...A student is only as good as the teacher. Just because you couldn't teach him doesn't mean he isn't capable of unlocking talent in it and also could mean sometimes you can be a bad teacher.  All this being said you probably weren't a good fit together.  Even if it was true that he didn't have much talent in it, it's super rude and YTA. You approached this horribly wrong and you absolutely owe him an apology. It sounds like you gave up on him and he wanted to learn. Instead of giving the honest truth of you not being able to be is teacher you told him he sucked...", "YTA your explanation was mean.", "YTA and prob not even that good at piano", "YTA because of your delivery. You and Sean didn\u2019t mesh well, that\u2019s perfectly fine. I trained new hires at a previous job and I can definitely say it\u2019s much easier and enjoyable when you click the person. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that happening. But it was unfair of you to tell Sean he didn\u2019t have talent. You should try to salvage yourself and go back and explain to him that wasn\u2019t what you meant, but that while you wish you could have had that teaching experience with him, you discovered that you don\u2019t have the patience that he needed, and it wouldn\u2019t have been a fair experience to Sean.", "YTA.\n\nThere was no reason to tell him he lacked talent. You could've said at the time you just weren't able to spare the time/patience it took to teach, but that you were sorry for that.", "I\u2019m a music teacher myself and an aunt and I can understand getting frustrated and lack of patience. You had me until you said \u201che had no talent for it\u201d like wtf. He didn\u2019t have no talent, you just weren\u2019t the right teacher for him. And as an aunt and teacher you should have encouraged him in other ways. He obviously feels that way and that you were unsupportive. You could have ended it without the jab. That\u2019s just straight up assholery. YTA.", "YTA - imo adding in he didn\u2019t have the talent for it when in reality you just didn\u2019t have the patience to teach him at his pace (which is really the only way you can effectively teach someone anything) was unnecessary. \n\nYou literally could have said anything else.", "YTA. Teaching is a talent that you lacked and it should\u2019ve been conveyed that way", "NTA.\nThis is not the popular opinion but I think you're fine. I've taught hundreds of kids to play instruments. If it weren't my job and just something I was doing for my enjoyment of playing, I would also turn down working with kids that weren't picking it up. There is absolutely some natural aptitude involved as well as a necessity for someone to be motivated enough to keep learning in their own.\nYou don't owe your nephew anything for just being related to you.  You weren't hired as an instructor. You gave it a try. He wasn't getting it. It wasn't fun for you. End of story.\n\nI think in general, \"talent\" gets confused with \"effort\" and if the kid wasnt progressing, he wasn't putting forth enough of it to not waste your time.", ">But he didn\u2019t lack talent though\n\n\n >A slow learner indicates that he was learning it was just taking longer than op expected and op gave up before the nephew did.\n\nThat's what lacking talent means...", "And so you would advise your young kid who really wants to play basketball to not even try with basketball because it has no hope to get into the NBA?\n\nAnd perfect pitch is not necessary to be a good musician or even just a reasonable one who enjoys music.", "Yes I agree with this! People mistake innate ability as the end all be all when the truth is the most successful musicians are not necessarily the most naturally talented, they just work harder. In my experience the people with an innate musical ability fall back on that and are more likely to be lazy in practice because it comes easily to them.", "And the one I keep running into is people who figure that if you can teach one person you can teach them all. If that\u2019s the case then every student who didn\u2019t breeze through their classes was totally and completely at-fault because the teacher managed to teach one person.", "What can I say? \"Do onto others\" and all that."]}
