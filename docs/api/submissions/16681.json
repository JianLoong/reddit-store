When Dixon learned to drive, I tried to help him once. He was rude, didn\u2019t listen, and scared the shit out of me. I also thought he might crash my car. \r  \nI told my Dad, \u201cHe needs a professional teacher. I am not going to teach him how to drive.\u201d\r  \nBobby was the exact opposite of Dixon. He was respectful, asked questions, listed, read the damn manual. He was a delight to teach. When he took his test, he used my car. I let him borrow it a few times when he had a date. He was a delight to teach.\r  \nDixon was hurt when he found out I taught Bobby. I was honest with him and said, \u201cYou needed someone with more experience to teach you. I would rather not put our relationship through the shitter for no reason.\u201d When he asked to borrow the car, I told him no, because he crashed his own car and treated my parents\u2019 vehicle badly.\r  \nBut I never said it in a way that implied he was a waste of time and not worth the hassle. He is a human and just because he isn\u2019t good at a certain skill doesn\u2019t make him pathetic or irritating. You can say the truth without it being sharpened with malice. \r  \n\u201cI didn\u2019t feel like I had the ability to help you learn piano. You needed more time that I had.\u201d", "YTA for the delivery.", "YTA simply for the way you handled it. You could have said at the time you were unable to handle the demands of piano tutoring instead of telling him he lacked talent to the point where you couldn\u2019t be bothered to continue. And if he actually took piano classes elsewhere, you should have encouraged him.", "Yes, YTA. Your nephew is clearly still hurt by your decision to not keep teaching him piano, and you rubbed salt in the wound for him as an adult by telling him he was untalented.\n\nI'm guessing you're not very talented at teaching. Not everyone learns at the same pace or in the same way, and in your ignorance, you harmed a child's experience with art.", "YTA.\n\nDifferent people learn at different rates. You obviously played favorites here because Sean wasn't learning as quickly as you wanted. If you're going to be a teacher in any way, shape, or form you're the one that needs to learn that everyone learns differently. You said that you didn't have the patience? Your nephew may have just wanted to spend time with you and do something that you also did so you could grow closer. Instead of that, you said that he wasn't good enough then shoved him off. If you wanted things done in an easy way, tell him upfront rather that dropping him like a baby giraffe.", "YTA for the way you handled this. You could have told him you just didn\u2019t think you were the right teacher for him, but instead you told him he wasn\u2019t talented enough. He\u2019s clearly already hurt that you ditched him, and you\u2019ve just made things worse.", "YTA. Tact is a thing. Learning about it and using it will take you far in life.", "Sorry, but YTA because you don't realise how devesting that sort of comment is to kids. This formed a core memory that with stick with this kid forever. You weren't being honest, you were being mean and spiteful to a kid because he didn't learn fast enough for you, as if you're so perfect at everything!!\n\nAnyway, you owe the kid an apology but probably best if you just don't as no doubt you'll mess that up also.", "YTA you could have simply said \"I realized I wasn't the right teacher for you and you could get better tutoring with a different teacher\".", "YTA - for his you said it like damn hes your nephew not just your ex client. Nothing wrong with not having the patience for nephew but you do with niece though, teaching ain't fun or remotely easy when you're students struggling.", "YTA he probably would have talent if you didn\u2019t write him off so easily. You literally only bothered for a few weeks. You\u2019re pretty crappy teacher if you write someone off like that for being a little slow. It clearly affected his self esteem when he was younger when you dropped him and now watching him teach his sister and say how much better she is is going to bring all that up again. I don\u2019t think teaching is for you, you affect young lives when you teach and if you write people off because you lack patience then you\u2019re not fit to be a teacher.", "Yta- though I half suspect the reason he was slower was because he didn\u2019t practice. Judging from my own lessons in piano that seems highly likely\u2026. The kids who came to session very slow often didn\u2019t practice that week, which means you are there as the teacher essentially running a practice session. I don\u2019t mind doing that if I\u2019m paid, but for free lessons I\u2019m not going to sit and put you through drills you could have easily done at home. either way, the way you expressed to your nephew why you stopped was rude and belittling.", "YTA. I don't know how you went from this:\n\n\n>I tried to do it but he was a very slow learner and I didn't have the patience\n\n\nTo this:\n\n\n>I was honest and told him he didn't have much talent in it\n\nThere's a big difference between a slow learner and an untalented person and most of the time, talent isn't the only thing that makes people successful. \n\nMy uncle didn't speak until he was 5, and he was an extremely slow learner. He also only graduated from highschool at 21 and his marks weren't great enough to get into Uni.\n\nHe's in his late 40s now and he just graduated with a cum laude from law school and he speaks 5 languages. \nJust because someone is slow doesn't mean they aren't talented or don't have the capacity to learn.", "YTA  I would give anything to have a talent that my nephew wanted me to teach him. To spend that quality time with this person who means so much to me, man! That would have been so special.\nEven if he wasn't very good at it, that time together would be precious and build a bond, and memories, for both our lives. \nIf your time and talent mean more to you than all that, you need to rethink your relationship and priorities.\nI love my nephew, and 2 nieces, beyond measure. Any bonding time with them is a gift. And don't worry, we found things to bond over; books, movies, nerd stuff, silly stuff. \nBut to teach them something that was my skill, that would have been amazing. \nSorry, this is long. I tend to gush when it comes to them.", "YTA", "You're a huge asshole.", "NTA but I don\u2019t think you are the best teacher. For what I understand, you are not a professional musician. It is easier to teach \u201cgood\u201d students. There is a reason why there are degrees in music education and pedagogy. If your niece has talent, it can be a good idea that she takes lessons with a piano teacher to improve her technique and everything that comes with it.", "You could have phrased that better. Maybe it wasn't only his lack of talent, but your lack of teaching experience? \nNTA for not teaching him, though.", "Are you a piano teacher? If not, then it\u2019s more likely that Sean needed someone more professional to teach him, and you definitely did the right thing by telling his dad.\nIf Tara is a quicker learner, or just understands better your way of teaching, then there shouldn\u2019t be anything wrong with you teaching her.\nInstead, what\u2019s with all the pettiness? He\u2019s 21 and mad because a 14 is better than him at learning?\nNTA.\n\nEdit: You definitely could\u2019ve worded it better though.", "NTA he\u2019s 21. He should be more than old enough to know that skill and learning abilities makes All the difference. (Yes it sucks but that doesn\u2019t make it any less true)\n\nOf my two closest cousins I would Love to teach the younger anything really, they listen well and is always ready to learn, adjust and give good feedback. Plus they are generally talented. It\u2019s a joy.\n\nThe older though a very nice and truly good person (like seriously they work for charity\u2019s both as work and basically every moment of their spare time) they just have a block that makes it Very hard for them to lear and incredibly difficult and frustrating to try and teach them. I wouldn\u2019t do it for money and there is certainly no pleasure involved. \n\nAnd sometimes it\u2019s just that one thing they cannot do no matter how much they want. \n\nI cannot use a drill no matter how often I\u2019ve tried. \nMy dad, genuinely, cannot assemble any kind of furniture or electronics.(or cook)\nMy closest sibling, who\u2019s a truly good cook, cannot bake a pie to safe their life. It\u2019s just pie, everything else they make is really good. They love pie though so it\u2019s frustrating for them. \n\nIt\u2019s just life being life.", "NTA buy you could\u2019ve worded it better without hurting his feelings.", "NTA. He\u2019s an adult. He asked a question and you gave him an honest answer without sugar coating it. \n\nThose who possess natural talent are easier to guide.", "NTA.\n\nPeople want honestly until they don't.", "EDIT: changed vote to NAH\n\nSean tried to get smart and you were honest with him. You lacked the patience to teach someone with his limited talent.\n\nSo you're either both AHs or neither AHs so I'm going with neither.", "ESH\n\nYou for what you said, but who cares, Sean is 21 years old now, imagine being still so bitter about not being taught piano as a child that you remember it and have to bring it up with a 14-year-old.
