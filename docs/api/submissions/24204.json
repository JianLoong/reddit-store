{"id": 24204, "submission_id": "15lmoc3", "title": "AITAH for not wanting to feed my roommates kid ?", "selftext": "So I (26f) offered my friend and her daughter a room to at my place . She'd recently separated from her BD. She was couch surfing or pay hotels for nights she had her daughter. I had told her that I would help with what I can as far as accommodating her and her daughter. Her daughter is 4 yrs old, I myself have a 7, 3, and 2 year old. Her daughters behavior is out of control, and she doesn't really take any initiative to discipline her, so she just wrecks havoc, and i try and step in as much as I can. But I am not the mother, and I can only do so much. This kid is big on saying \"no\" to her mom, me, and my significant other. And when it's her mom telling her to do something and she says no to her, she's like well then stop, and she still continues on her bullshit, and the mom will just sit there and continue doing what she was doing. She says \" if she annoys me enough I just give her what she wants\" in front of her kid.  Now, this kid doesn't spend that much time here anyways, it might be a few hours every few days. But then this kid gets here, is always hungry, and the mom never buys groceries to feed her, just herself (since she doesn't have her often) but this leaves me footing the bill on snacks, meals, etc. It's been months now, and I've told her that I do not mind as long as things are being replenished. I feel like an asshole, but I don't want to feed her kid anymore. She's rude AF when she's here, and she's always starting fights with my kids, and refuses to share toys. And then she doesn't even ask politely for food, she'll be like \" I want that\" \" I'm hungry too\". Now my frustration also stems from the fact that the days she's here mom just goes upstairs and naps. I'm not getting any help with feeding the kids, cleaning after them, and much less discipling them. I do not have the financial means of feeding another kid, as most times when I do end up feeding her what I make, that means my SO and I cut our portions smaller to accommodate. I'm not sure how to bring this up to her without being an asshole or making her feel any sort of way. But I constantly feel like my friends always take advantage of me in this sense. Recently too, I stopped working to take care of the kids, and shortly after my SO was let go from his job. So money has been extremely tight. It's not a secret to her, she's well aware of this situation. But anytime her kid asks her for food, she'll be like well ask (me).. and how the fuck am I supposed to be like, no your mom needs to feed you.. am I an asshole ? I grew up with the belief that food is not something to ever be stingy with, but I worry about feeding myself and my family.\n\n\nEDIT: thank you guys for the support. I appreciate everyone, and especially those harsh responses where you put it into perspective that it's not me I'm allowing this to happen to just me but my own family. I wanted the reassurance that I was not making something bigger than it had to be because I was being emotional about the situation, and wanted to make sure I wasn't somehow misplacing my own financial frustration on someone else. But thank you! I will be talking to her asap. It's something I feel I need to do in person vs sending over text. Just to make sure I can get the point across clearly and concisely. Again thank you guys. Also just a reassurance, nobody in my family went hungry because of this kid, but it was an extra workload and cost for me, regardless of how big or small. And I'm not getting anything other than rent in return, and I'm clearly taking the role of more than just landlord. So thanks guys. I'll keep you posted to see how it goes !", "created_utc": 1691511366, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15lmoc3/aitah_for_not_wanting_to_feed_my_roommates_kid/", "score": 48, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

All day when she's not here they play just fine, but the moment she walks in the door, fighting breaks out, someone's slapping someone or taking shit from the other. Those two hours now seem endless. And then I'll have to set boundaries with this kid, and kids aren't fucking stupid, and this kid knows she can work her mom, so she'll give me a side eye as she comes into my room for example that I tell her to stay out of. But because her mom's in there she'll walk past me to ask her mom for a hug or kiss, or to tell her I love you. You know, anything to go over what I just told her. And she falls for her kids guilt trip, and it's fucking pathetic. And the thing is too, I am starting to really fucking hate this kid, and it's not healthy as an adult to beef with a toddler lol", "Seriously. It sucks, because this was all discussed before moving in. I just ask she pay her bills, and help clean the house, and that we would be handling the kids together. I told her that I'd help her get stabilized , so her and her daughter can have the opportunity to build a foundation without any worry of a break up, or having to commit to some dude just for a roof. I would try and help her with her daughters eating habits ( as she suffers from constipation quite frequently). My kids eat a lot of fruits and veggies , and we cook at home a majority of the time. And she always said she loved that my kids were like that, and would ask for help with her kid so she could get her eating better.  But it went from agreeing to all this to me cooking meals and her kid starts saying ewe thats gross, i don't like that, can you make me this or that. And her mom says nothing, does nothing. At first I would accomodate some of the meals to her liking, but after I got no help with groceries or cooking or cleaning. I just started cooking meals with more vegetables knowing she would refuse to eat them. A little petty but it got my kids eating more veggies too haha. But yeah, nothing, I've asked her for help cleaning and she's OCD so she'll only do it if she has gloves. And now she never has gloves. She's got dishes in the rooms ( she recently switched rooms and still has a pile of dishes in both). She'll stand in the kitchen and just watch me clean.. and then it's frustrating cuz my kids are always hungry and asking for food, so if they ask her for food, she'll give them some, and of course her daughter too and that's super irritating for me. Cuz again, my kids eat a lot of fruits and veggies and they go through them quick, and she wants to go to town too, without replenishing something . Asking for meals, and food that's not hers, and of course as a child she doesn't understand, but I personally would never ever feel comfortable taking food regularly from someone else to feed my kids, and not chip in with groceries. When I was single and struggling, I remember the weeks I would have her I would get groceries, and then the weeks I didn't i would just eat less, and I wasn't starving, I was just more frugal with myself to have plenty for my kid. I also had her in daycare, which she refuses to do because she has a legit phobia of letting her kid out into the world. Literally won't go to the park because she has to wipe down the equipment with sanitary wipes in order to allow her child up there. It just doesn't make sense to me how a \"helicopter mom\" is behaving like this", "Thank you! I'm taking notes here. I need to stick to the facts, and I just want to keep myself from attacking her personally. I'm hoping she just needs a little shake back to reality. I am by no means a perfect mom, and I don't want to shame her for anything, but this is just a little pathetic imo. I know instability, but this kid lives in the back of a car. And it's 110+ degrees out here daily, so it's just not safe for the kid. I feel for her too, cuz she's a smart kid, very sassy, but no manners what so ever. Kid comes in here telling me she's the little boss. And her mom's over there like aww how fucking cute is she... While I'm over here explaining to her that the only one who runs shit around her is me, whilst her mom stays silent. And that I think is what irritates me the most. She tells her kid to do something and when she says no, I back her up, and I tell her, we do not speak to our mothers like that, and in this house you need to do [insert command]. And she listens, but then she's over here letting her kid do some wild shit, fighting and screaming like screaming bloody murder. And I'm having to intervene, and there no fucking back up. And my SO obviously is not comfortable disciplining other peoples children either. So this kid just gets away with shit while she's here. And she was leaving her with me from time to time to go run a quick errand, and I didn't mind because I would do the same on occasion. But this kid started acting up, and I just immediately sent her to her room, and because of this she was finally listening to me. And she doesn't leave her with me anymore, and I have the feeling that it's probably because she doesn't agree with me sending her kid to the room, or whatever. But all progress made is all lost now.", "Lol harsh, but thanks \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude4f you're right. And I will.most definitely be addressing this ASAP.", "Yes ma'am! Haha just the talking i needed. I will absolutely be doing this. She may not even be napping just hanging out in her room, but I'm always downstairs taking care of my kids either feeding them, cleaning up after them, or just general house chores.", "Yeah, I agree. This is definitely my own doing. But I honestly don't want to pack my kids up and take them outside to do anything. It's been at a steady 100-120 degrees out here, and I feel irresponsible putting my kids in the car like that. It's hard to keep them entertained at times, but we have to make it work, cuz they'll overheat quick being outside. I'm gonna talk to her, and let her know this isn't going to work if we don't make changes. It sucks cuz she's real sweet, and I know none of this is done out of malice, but ignorance is equally harmful. And I can't spread myself so thin, just to still not get any help in return.", "Yeah, I tried that, but I'm irritated AF with the kids'lack of manners and respect for me and my SO. She doesn't ask nicely, she asks and complains, and doesn't say thank you. Mom doesn't even guide her through this new arrangement of hey we're living with other people, and their kids. So like the kid has no direction, doesn't know how to act. Mom's not there to call her out on her bullshit. It's aggravating me, and I feel terrible, because all the resent feels like it's towards the kid, and I need to get mad at the mom. I have kids, but I'm not the type of person who can say they love kids, I love my kids, and polite kids. But this kid STINKS, type of kid you don't invite to a birthday party. Her favorite thing to do when I tell her to be nice to my kids (she steps on them, kids them, takes their toys etc) and I intervene but mom does nothing. I'll send her to her room (with mom) just for her to annoying her mom and then she kicks her off it of the room. And she's back at it with me", "She does work ! Luckily recently her kid hadn't been here for very long. Maybe an hour or two on occasion. So it was easier to tolerate. But yesterday was the last straw. The infrequency of it didn't help my feelings of being used, so then when she asked me for an apple, and I was making dinner for my kids anyways, so to not say no, I just said no because I'm making dinner (that way my kids wouldn't ask for food either and the kid wouldn't feel singled out. The dinner I was making was something I knew she would never dare try so it wasn't gonna bite me in the ass if she was still there when dinner was done) and then the kid was like I'll ask my mom, and comes back says she said yes ! So I replied with the dinner response. And I think she overheard my refusing to feed her child and caught the mood of the room, cuz she called BD and said she was misbehaving and she was bringing her back. I feel so bad for this kid. And I was like am I really gonna talk to my \"friend\" about her asking me for an apple ? But now laying it all out like this, I realize it's been love over due .", "Yeah, I have this really bad habit of self sacrificing for others. And I take friendship really seriously, so I feel like I've allowed myself to get ran over like this, I can't blame her entirely for it, as I try to be generous, and help people out. Especially a single mom, but yeah. I'm gonna talk to her next time I see her. She pays rent but other than that nothing else really. Her bathroom is downstairs (it's the guest bathroom) and I'm always forced to clean that since she doesn't ever get to it. She switched rooms in the house and there's dishes and clothes still all over the floor in the other one. I've asked her to help with floors and she said yes and then never did. And then yesterday I dropped the hint. I hate floors, and she's like yeah it makes you all sweaty. And she just stood there microwaving her meal and continued to eat as I cleaned around her. I've told her too, like if she can't pay, she can pay in services, like helping. Which now that i say that out loud I realize I'm the problem, setting such low fucking standards and expectations for others. I will resolve this ASAP though, I'm getting used and abused.", "Yeah essentially.. I will talk to her and tell her either get it together or get out. But usually , the option always ends up being leaving, cuz people don't change for other people. Sucks to find out this is who I've been \"friends\" with", "Yeah my thoughts exactly. The kid is super fucking picky, so luckily most nights she didn't even want what I had to make, but there was one week I fed her breakfast lunch and dinner two days in a row. And that's when I was like yeah no, this is not happening. So since that day, I've cooked meals with extra veggies so she won't want it. But it's just the fact that she has no plan to feed her or feeds her absolute shit when she does. (Kid was constipated AF the other day, bleeding, and it happens often, and it's because they enable her bad eating habits) she lives off slim Jim's, McDonald's , and butter noodles, the only time she's ever gotten a balanced meal is when I'm providing it. But yeah, she's getting the boot. I'm scheming plans to make it so the kid doesn't want the food, and I shouldn't have to be so fucking polite.", "Yup talk to the mom. Tell her straight that you and your family are now affected. And as a parent your first priority will always be your own kids. So you cant accomodate her and her kid anymore. If she huffs and puffs then we know where the kid got them attitude.", "Does she really have OCD if she lets dishes pile up in rooms?\n\nOP. you and your SO really need to kick her out. If she pays rent to you, she can pay it somewhere else. She is a mooch and it's time to let her go. It may be hard but she will eventually land on her feet without your help.", "Don't give a chance, OP. If she's like that, you're only prolonging this situation. Say something alongside the lines of:\n\n\n\"Look, this isn't working out. We have very different habits and needs. I can't help you anymore. I'm sorry, but you need to move out. You can stay here until [date].\"", "Its really hard blending two households, especially when you have two different parenting styles. Or a lack of parenting on one end, so not only is it financially hard on you guys, its emotionally draining on you and your kids.\nSo you and your husband can have this discussion with her if you want - I would definitely mention the rising food and utility costs and just be clear that while shes here she needs to start to contribute, as its now putting you in debt. \nIf you want you can also ask her how she feels about you disciplining her kid/keeping them on the same routine as yours for consistency - which is good for all kids. But again, you dont want to step on her toes. I know that if her kid gets away with things, yours may see that and start acting out. So thats why im mentioning that if shes continuing to stay, youll also want to have that discussion.", "Do not let her take advantage of you. Your trying your hardest, do not let her make it even harder.", "I'm sorry, but this is like letting someone hit you in the head with a hammer and then complaining about how much it hurts. Get this demon child and her mom OUT.", "She switched rooms in your house? She has food for herself and not her kid?\n\nAnd you claim that she is a friend?", "That's what I think all the time!! Her room is a fucking mess. Clothes everywhere. She won't touch things with her hands to clean, but she'll walk around and lay in her mess. Makes no fucking sense, I don't know if maybe she's going through some crisis or depression, but she does for sure only have two options now. Get it together, or get out. I cannot and will not continue this.", "Yeah, and I've definitely noticed a shift in my own kids'behaviors. The tantrums and the no's were getting from them is not usual for them. Luckily with her recently spending less time here, we've been able to handle it pretty well on our end. But it's extremely exhausting. And I will definitely have this talk with her. I have too much going on to be going through this as well. It's been since May that I'm waiting for her to contribute with more than a loaf of bread and peanut butter.", "Yeah, I honestly just need the reassurance that I wasn't being overly emotional, but I just opened a can of worms talking about this out loud. And I don't know what the fuck I was doing. I had it \"under control\" but why the fuck is this a situation I even wanted to make myself responsible for ?! I'm fs doing a lot of self reflecting, and I am anxious to get this conversation out of the way. It is absolutely mind blowing what I've allowed to unfold in my own house.", "I know. I seem to have the bigger issue here now. Allowing this sort of shit. I was really holding onto the possibility of this being a mutually beneficial arrangement but it's just everything but at this point. I am my own worst enemy here haha but I will correct this.", "1 - stop hinting.  She knows what you meant and has no intention of doing anything.\n\n\n2 - you and your partner are subsidizing her whole lifestyle.  That's why she has groceries and manicures and you have worries.\n\n\nCheck the local tenant agreements for your area because she needs to go as soon as possible.  Friday would be good if that's legal."]}
