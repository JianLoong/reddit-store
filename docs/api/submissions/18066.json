Pregnancy after infertility feels like the finish line gets further away, and like the other shoe could drop at any time.

He needs to be met halfway, loved and honored. \n\nI would talk to him, and consider therapy if it's feasible.\n\nOne of my biggest regrets is not pursuing therapy for each of us, because we had a very difficult time adjusting to the realities of parenthood after everything we went through.\n\nBest wishes to you both.", "Everytime I get asked about drug use my response is \"only the prescription ones!\" Followed by laughing because I think I'm hilarious.

He broke into a giant smile and said \u201cthat\u2019s a relief!\u201d Every appt after that he was really warm and animated. \n\n(Side note - we think his disappointment was that he had thought we weee somewhat normal humans and not idiots, and the whole sigh thing was most likely because he had dealt with some really messed up dumb people previously).", "NAH.

I personally don\u2019t like it, but that is HIS method of coping with what he went through. At the same time, I make a lot of suicide jokes because of my trauma and experience.

I also get how stuff like that just pops right on out of your mouth before you ACTUALLY THINK about it.  I have a really smart mouth and my sarcasm just falls out and sometimes the timing is REALLY BAD, so I have to apologize, some people are understanding of the humor in it, others not so much.  It's hard to filter stuff sometimes, especially smart-ass comments, but maybe try a little harder to filter in front of husband, but also just keep letting him know it's not like you are serious about this stuff, and it's something you would never even DREAM of doing.

I absolutely understand the dark humor in healthcare. However, I also understand your husband's fear that the joke would be taken seriously.

Exam rooms aren't soundproof, and if a well intentioned staff member overhears, there will be a problem. \n\nI get it, I have dark humor too and a rather dry delivery. I have migraines, and made a comment to my doc to the effect of \"lot fewer incidents of wanting to bash my skull in\" when we were discussing how my new medication was working. He knows me, and he chuckled because he knew I meant that the meds were helping. Unfortunately, a nurse walked in right at the tail end of that conversation. I got risk of self-harm flagged for a while. I get it, and better safe than sorry, but I learned to be mindful of how I phrase things in places where I might be heard by others.", "And you're acting like he should be taking everything in stride when OP literally describes it as a struggle and a trauma for both of them!\n\nI bet you anything that OP is getting sympathy and support from friends, family, coworkers. For the husband and his friends, what do you think the likelihood is that this subject \"just isn't something we guys talk about\"? Do you think any of his coworkers did so much as tell him they're sorry in passing?\n\n(I'm not saying that's impossible, he *might* very well have emotionally supportive friends and coworkers, but I'm thinking it's faaaaaar less likely.)", "\"it's safe to say we have some trauma from it\" being twisted into \"he's immensely traumatized and needs immediate therapy\" is completely ridiculous. And why is only one reaction to said trauma allowed?", "I work in healthcare design. Exam rooms should be close to if not completely soundproof if they're built to code, which if they've been designed in the last 10 years they would be. There's extensive testing done once an exam room is built to make sure it's soundproof and if it's not usually a white noise machine is put in to block noise from leaving a room. Having unsoundproofed exam rooms are a massive HIPAA violation waiting to happen.", "Can you point to where I said he needs immediate therapy? Because I don\u2019t think I said anything remotely like that. Let me check though. \n\n*pauses to check*\n\nNope, i didn\u2019t say anything remotely like that. Now, can you point to where I said her reaction is invalid? Because I think I pretty explicitly said I have no problem with her making the joke. Let me check though. \n\n*pauses to check*\n\nYeah, I explicitly said I have no problem with her making the joke. \n\nBored now. Enjoy the rest of your day.", "> Bored now.\n\nNice to come across another person of culture. It's almost like you're my doppelganger! I wish you a good day.", "You're right, I exaggerated. It helps balance the selective nature that you used in only pointing out the mention of trauma."]}
