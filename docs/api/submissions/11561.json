That way he's getting a truly equal amount.", "The only thing I'd say is that 5k ten years ago does not get a similar used car as 5k today in this car market.\n\nSo, maybe you could index for inflation/market changes? But be fair to the stepson.\n\nStill, NTA.", "Nta\n\nSounds like your son is entitled, and your ex is stirring the pot.", "NTA and deduct 1k for a complaint from son And 500 for complaints from his mom.", "Yeah. $5k in 2014 is around $6,300 now. And the chip shortage caused car prices to go up a bit\u2026", "Do your bio kids get the same one on one time as step kids? I hope your bio son isn't being ignored for stepson......I know it must be hard juggling your time. Often money isn't the real factor here.", "NTA. Ex-wife and bio som should put their money where their mouths are. \ud83e\udee2", "NTA. You should give an extra grand to both your son and stepson because of ten years inflation, though.", "You\u2019re NTA, but I want to point out that while you gave the same amount of money, you did not give these boys the same amount of purchasing power you gave your oldest, *nine years ago*. Inflation has been soaring and car prices are one of the worst hit. Just something you might want to think about.", "NTA", "NTA but 5k today is not the same as 5k 9-10 years ago. That being said, bio son actually got more than stepson given the situation. \nEx is just using this as a club to hit you with. She is free to pitch in whatever she wants.", "Info: are there any deeper issues with fairness between your son and stepson that could be fueling this?  I think teaching your kids responsibility is a great thing but your son is growing up in two homes and is getting inconsistent messages from each house. He\u2019s 17 and his mom is in his ear telling him he isn\u2019t being treated fairly. NTA, but I do think this has the potential to damage your relationship with your son if you don\u2019t work through it.", "I am a guy around your age. Hell no. You are not the AITA. The AITAs are your step son and ex.\n\nIf you give him more money your step daughter could feel resentful . You are treating both equally. If my ex step son had called me unfair for not giving more, I would take all the 5k back. He cannot see you are being generous  already and is demanding more? Where did he get this sense of entitlement?", "YTA   And his mom should chip in some $$$ as well.", "Not the A your ex is a bad influence in your son by encouraging this sense of entitlement.", "I am going with NAH here, although as a parent myself choosing to give TEENAGERS 5k instead of just giving them a budget while car shopping is an interesting choice, to say the least, how do you know they won't do something incredibly stupid with the money? I.E opioids are the number one killer of young people. I definitely wouldn't turn my teenagers loose with free money, I always gave them a budget at the car lot and let them pick out a car in that price range.", "Outside inflation, it's fair. There is the note to help fixing it so it looks alright.\n\nNTA", "Or the mother could help with the difference as well. It shouldn\u2019t have to all be on one parent.", "i agree honestly \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f"]}
