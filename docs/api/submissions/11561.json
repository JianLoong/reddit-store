You literally can\u2019t say any fairer than that", "You gave all children 5k toward a car. The other kids chose a cheaper car. Nothing wrong with that. Your son chose to save for a more expensive car. Nothing wrong with that. \n\nWhat is wrong is the expectation that your son should get more money for... no other reason than he wants more money?

You have offered to help fix up cheaper cars as well.\n\nYou sir, are NTA.  There is no part of this that has been unfair to any of them.  You have treated them all the same.  Your son not buying a car with the money provided, is not your fault.", "NTA. It\u2019s fair and your ex is pushing for you to favour the kids and is clearly having an influence on your sons thinking. Just cos you got it doesn\u2019t mean you have to give it.", "Only for putting up with this and having given your son the money instead of helping pay for the car he was buying with the money. NTA, and your ex sounds like a horrible influence.", "NTA and this is good lesson for your son to make sure he\u2019s not an entitled brat since your ex seems determined to make him be one.", "NTA. Your son is either spoiled or being manipulated by your ex, or both.", "NTA but it's been a decade since you gave your stepdaughter $5K. If you are acting like the $5K now is even, it really isn't. It won't buy nearly the same car. But $5K is still generous.", "NTA. Your son and your ex think that you\u2019d favor him for being your bio kid and get privileges. Well, apparently you\u2019re raising your children all the same, with the same values. Pity your son doesn\u2019t want to learn those great lessons. If your ex wants your son to have extra money for his car, she\u2019s free to contribute.", "NTA tell your ex to cough up the rest of the money needed and your son is listening to his mom who most likely is in his ear about this matter.\nAs a guy that grew up poor $5000 towards a car would have been god sent.", "NTA - biological or not, playing favourites by giving him more is a slippery slope.", "NTA. good on you for not giving in and putting that extra money to it. He's incredibly lucky you're willing to give him that much in the first place.", "NTA. And honestly, given all the posts here with people obviously favouring their biological kids over their step kids, this is a refreshing change. You treated them all equally, and I think it\u2019s a generous gift. The fact that you\u2019re willing to help the fix up an inexpensive car is also awesome. Bonding time, and they hopefully learn a bit about car maintenance. \n\nYour son can either save up, or his mother can give him the extra, since it\u2019s obviously import to her.", "5K doesn\u2019t go as far as it used to, but ignoring inflation, your position seems fair and respectful. Your son wants a nicer car than your stepson. You say \u201cokay. Here\u2019s $5K, guess you\u2019ll have to save the rest\u201d. This is, coincidentally, how the works works. I think there\u2019s no AHs here, except your ex. Your son can be excused for pushing you after his mom freaked out at you. But your position is reasonable, your childrens\u2019 different car preferences are reasonable, and you respect them and let them make their own choices.

You gave everyone $5k towards a car, they all CHOSE to get a cheaper car, and your son is the only one who wanted a more expensive car\n\nIt would be unfair if you did help him pay for a more expensive car. The other kids will think that you\u2019re playing favorites by helping your son in getting a more expensive car. I suggest sticking to your word and letting your son save up the rest of the money for the car he wants; you gave him a significant boost, the rest is up to him", "NTA. Your son should feel blessed that his Dad can afford to give him 5k towards a car. Alot of parents don\u2019t have the means to do that.\nYour ex wife needs to sit the hell down and cough up the money to help the child, that you BOTH created, get a car. Realistically he can get one for under 5k. He\u2019s just choosing not to and hoping you\u2019ll give him more. \n\nDon\u2019t. You\u2019re absolutely right in wanting to teach responsibility.", "To be fair. When op bought the car for the oldest child, which was 10 years ago, $5000 would get you an okay car.

If your son wants a better car, he can be grateful that he has 5K from you and can work a little harder to get the rest.", "NTA and I want to know where you are finding a used car for 5K right now that is even Drive able. We are looking for our 15 year old and really struggling.", "NTA, you gave the same amount to each kid.\n\nThe only thing I would consider is that since your stepdaughter turned 16 and your bio son, 5k is worth a lot less, so maybe more than 5k could be given for both step and bio sons.\n\nJust food for thought", "NTA. You gave everyone the same amount to do with as they please. He wants to save for a nicer car - that's fine, but doesn't mean you have to pay for it. Something tells me you ex is putting this in his head.", "NTA. You can't be more fair than you have.", "NTA you made the same $ offer and he chose something that cost more. Which means he has to cover it.", "NTA. You made the same bargain with all of them.", "NTA. You\u2019re a good dad for teaching them responsibility. Your ex is teaching them entitlement, \u201cyour dad can afford it so you deserve it.\u201d \nThe world does not give handouts. And that is a very valuable lesson. Stand your ground. \n\nOne thing is maybe you should adjust for inflation. Like if your daughter bought a 3-year old car with 30k miles 10 years ago for 5k, look up the price for her make and model with the same specs now. And offer that price.\n\nEta one word", "How are you unfair? This is sad. You are 100% correct on this one.", ">He called me an unfair ass.\r  \n\r\n\nNTA. I agree with the unfair part, in the reverse direction. You could have given your son $2,500, and told your ex-wife to pitch in the rest, and I think you should tell your son that. He has both his biological parents possibly able to provide from him. Your stepson had one (and she couldn't).\n\nIn all seriousness you made a good enough decision, and you are under no obligation to make a decision your son agrees with. He can take his different opinion and do anything he wants with it, that's part of independence and personal responsibility.", "NTA. They are all your kids, and you want to give them all the same opportunity. Excellent (step) parenting!\n\nThough I would add one minor caveat that the $5k you gave your stepdaughter 10 years ago would have gone much further than the $5k you gave your sons this year. Maybe it needs slightly adjusting for inflation?", "Nta", "NTA. It sounds like you are being very fair.", "NTA- you gave him the same option as the others.

They didn\u2019t buy me a car at all. \n\nI worked my butt off bought a car (clunker). Worked through college as I didn\u2019t get the 1k a month allowance he did. \n\nWanna know how we all turned out? That brother is 37, lives at home. Can\u2019t hold down a job because every time he starts a job he gets mad that his coworkers don\u2019t respect him.  The rest of us went on to be pretty successful.

I think it's way better that he learns it from me than from the world, because unfortunately the world won't be kind to his current attitude.", "Yeah a PS5, new TV, some weed, concert and sports tickets, some fast-casual meals\u2026 chances are the kid has spent most or all of it by now", "That's on him.", "Thank you for your perspective on this! \n\nMy parents raised 5 sons and gave us what they could, but they didn't have much, so we pretty much all got jobs at 15 and started making some money of our own. I did quite well for myself and am thankfully able to provide a lot for my children. But I won't make any differences between them, to my stepkids I am their dad, to my stepson I am the only dad he ever knew. And I adore all 4 of my kids.", "Obviously."]}
