{"id": 6400, "submission_id": "102cbnz", "title": "AITA for telling my mother in-law she is a nightmare and does not help with her pestering?", "selftext": "I (34f) married my husband Logan (37m) 6 years ago. He was a widower with two children; Luca now 16 and Milo now 15. His first wife died when the boys were 5 and 6 years old and we met a year later, became friends and more after several months of friendship. I get along fine with my stepson's. But they never wanted me to act motherly toward them, which I was fine with, I had hoped we would build up a friendship and maybe a close bond that was different to their parents but still special. Ever since my husband and I married, though, his parents have been making it clear that I need to embrace my role as the boys mom. Logan told them to knock it off and around him they did. But occasionally I would get a comment about how the boys do not act like they are close to me, and how I don't act like a mother should. It was bothersome but I did my best to ignore it.\n\nOver time it started to weigh on me that my relationship with the boys remained distant. We get along fine, as I said. But that's about it. They are very close to their dad and I'm glad. They don't give me trouble. I just feel on the outside with them. Having the comments from my in-law's were not helping either. It felt like I couldn't do anything right. The boys didn't want me to act as a mom so I remained just a support in their lives, but that meant my in-law's saw me as not being a good addition to their grandson's lives. But I never wanted to be the jerk stepparent who forced myself on them either. I do not believe that is the way to go. When I got pregnant it only got worse. My emotions were a little more all over the place and it hurt more to have that distant but polite relationship with the boys. Then knowing my in-law's were likely watching every move I made during my pregnancy to see if I was favoring the baby over the boys. I ended up confiding in my mom about it. I just let go and she was a great support. When I had my son she would come over to offer support with my husband back at work.\n\nMy mother in-law stopped by while mom was here. She came to bring up the fact Luca and Milo had rejected her offer to get me a mother necklace for Christmas with photos of them and my son, telling her I was not their mom. She told me the fact the boys feel that way is shocking and they need me to do better. My mom told her it was time to leave and that the conversation was over. She told her to stay out of it. She told me I owe it to her grandsons to not make them feel like they have no mom. I was so desperate that I told her they don't want another mom, they never wanted me like that and she and her husband were driving me to the brink with all the comments about me not doing a good job. I asked why she was such a nightmare and added she was not helping me or them. This was before Christmas. She is still furious. Logan decided we needed a time out from them. But his mom said I blew up at her for no good reason.\n\nI feel bad.

These days, we are close enough that we'll roll our eyes at each other when my mom does one of those things that makes both of us crazy.

Which ultimately means that you feel that they are \"wrong\" for not wanting the same relationship as you.\n\nRight now the boys need you for who you are. Ask yourself what's wrong with that? You're deciding that those two boys are empty cups that need filling...but they may already be full because you're already providing them with what they need.\n\nDon't keep making the same mistake as your inlaws.
