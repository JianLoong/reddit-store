So many options but you jumped right to stealing step daughter's birthday.  Is your stepdaughter's name Cinderella?", "Why not have the sleepover on the Friday and meal in the Saturday?", "YWBTA. Why not have both? Dad goes to older daughter's dinner, you stay and chaperone daughter's party and sleepover.", "Yta so so bad and so is your husband for not protecting his child. If your daughter doesn\u2019t have a weekend birthday this year and wasn\u2019t going to celebrate on the day of why don\u2019t you do the weekend before her birthday instead? Your stepdaughter deserves to have her day to herself and especially since her birthday actually falls on a weekend day she should have her party/celebration on that day. Your daughter can have a party weekend before hers, it\u2019s not hard to figure out. Why don\u2019t you try loving your stepchild as much as your kid and wanting happiness for them both! Age doesn\u2019t matter, they\u2019re your kids and deserve equal love and celebration. Signed, a step mother and mother", "YTA. Each kid should have their own birthday which should be appropriate for their age. \n\nYou can do the sleep over for 7yo the weekend before her birthday and the nice dinner the next weekend on Stepdaughters birthday.", "Question. Are you trying to be the \"wicked stepmother?\" Because if you are, you are well on your way. \n\n\"My husband agrees with me and is happy to do it this way\" \n\nThis tells everyone that you have turned her dad against her and have him focusing on his \"new\" family. \n\nYTA and so is your husband", "Why not have the party on Friday, the kids will be able to still have the sleepover, they can leave mid day and your step daughter will still be able to enjoy her birthday dinner. You could also have the party the Saturday before her birthday.", "Or have it the weekend before. There's no reason it's required to be the weekend after\n\nYTA OP", "Very fair, practical advice. Not even my question and you helped me out \ud83d\ude06", "Why not the Saturday before daughter\u2019s birthday? It\u2019s equally close to the date.", "Why would you not have already had daughter's party the previous weekend is what I'm wondering. That would have solved all the problems", "Regarding the Friday party/sleepover idea: I LOVE Friday evening kid parties. They are already spun up from the week. They love being with their friends for a little longer. And they pass out earlier than Saturday nights. After my kid\u2019s first, I now wish all parties were on Friday night.", "This! Have the weekend before. It doesn\u2019t make a difference for the 7yo.", "Definitely get vibes OP doesn\u2019t understand (or doesn\u2019t care) that stepchildren are often treated as second-class children, and their own history can make them especially sensitive. So why not comfort them not undermine them, especially where there\u2019s no need for conflict?", "The 7 year old could have her sleep over the weekend before. Op wants her daughter to take center stage at stepdaughters birthday.\n\nThis is horrible and cruel.", "That's exactly what I'm thinking. If you're already moving someone's birthday, you might as well move it to a date that's convenient for everyone and doesn't make someone else move their birthday.", "No she\u2019s 18 currently she\u2019s turning 19", "To be fair, you can\u2019t do a sleepover on a Sunday, so there are more limited options for daughter\u2019s birthday. But that still leaves Friday or the weekend before.", "The bot only counts the first vote, put dashes between the nta like this N-T-A", "We must have read a different post because the SD isn\u2019t selfish! It\u2019s her birthday and she has the right to have it celebrated on her actual birthday you know Saturday. Unlike the 7 year old who\u2019s birthday/slumber party can happen the weekend before. See simple and both get to celebrate. If anyone should have to reschedule it\u2019s the person\u2019s that has the birthday falling on a weekday. It\u2019s not fair to the person who\u2019s birthday it actual is to ask to not celebrate them and only celebrate your stepsister. That\u2019s wrong when they\u2019re other ways to make it happen with one of them feeling left out. By the way you are def biased.", "How is the SD selfish?", "Brush up your reading skills. OP is moving her bio kids birthday in such a way it interferes with SD\u2019s actual birthday. SD is not selfish, OP is prioritizing her bio kid.", "This is what we do. My kiddos have bdays 4 days apart. On any given year, one kid has a bday the weekend before and the other the weekend after. OP has to move it anyway. If the bday naturally falls during the week we also either go out or I cook the child\u2019s favorite dish to have a mini celebration on the bday.", "My thoughts exactly! There\u2019s no reason why you can\u2019t make this work for both girls. Unless you just don\u2019t want to. Your daughter can have her sleepover the Saturday before so that your stepdaughter can have hers on her actual birthday!\nThat fact that you didn\u2019t even try to accommodate your stepdaughter makes YTA", "This is best solution.", "Fun fact: celebrating someones birthday early is a big no no in Germany. It's based on superstition and most people don't know why, but its deeply ingrained.", "I was going to suggest the same thing", "Because the stepdaughter isn\u2019t a priority lol", "YTA - how many times did you do that to her before? And how many of step daughters people will really show up on Sunday and have time for her than?", "Even so, why can't your daughter's party be on the previous or following Saturday?", "So because she will be 19 it's ok to steal her birthday day from her in favor of 7 year old.  \n\n\nAs someone suggested you can do sleepover on Friday and Saturday is free for your stepdaughter.  \n\n\nBut I get it since she's only your stepdaughter it's ok to put her into second place. Just don't cry \"Why won't she talk to us\" or \"Why is she so cold to us\" when she finally has enough of your BS.", "Why does that  matter you evil step mother? YTA and so is your spineless husband. It\u2019s your step daughters birthday just let her have the day", "You asked for the internet\u2019s opinion, and the internet gave it. Now unless you intentionally want to ruin your relationship with your stepdaughter and become the evil step mother, plan out the two parties in a more thoughtful way.", "Apparently in the Philippines it is fine to celebrate a birthday early but bad luck to celebrate it late.", "It\u2019s already planned for \u201cthe following\u201d Saturday, if you\u2019re suggesting moving it back another week then OP will say that\u2019s too far from the actual birthday.  But has conveniently said nothing about the idea of having it the prior Saturday because she just wants to ruin her step-daughter\u2019s birthday."]}
