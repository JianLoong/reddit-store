And, NTA!", "NTA but...\n\nPeople make the mistake of not reading menu's properly/letting their waitperson know their restrictions. You should have told him so he could make an informed decision before taking the next bite. He knows his food restrictions and should have checked/asked if the dish contained anything he chooses not to eat.", "NTA. He\u2019s a big boy and knows what an egg looks like as well as you do.", "I\u2019ve never been so surprised by an AITA comment section. Does everyone really think she shouldn\u2019t have mentioned it because \u201che\u2019s grown and thus responsible for what he eats?\u201d \n\nMistakes happen. He deserves to know if he\u2019s unintentionally breaking his diet. \n\nYTA both for not doing the normal thing and letting him know you\u2019d noticed what he was eating, and especially for then telling him after you\u2019d let him have it all.", "How is she not the asshole for bringing it up later?\n\nIf she had something immediately or said nothing it would be a \"no harm, no foul\" situation but she picked the worst of the three options", "This nta, if he can eat eggs baked in dishes like cake. It seems like the issue is that he doesn\u2019t like eggs texture/taste, not morally against eating them. So if it didn\u2019t bother him while eating that particular dish, it shouldn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s like when he eats them in cakes\u2026.", "It was chopped up hard boiled egg. If you can\u2019t even identify this very common ingredient you refuse to eat, I don\u2019t know what to tell you.  \n\nExcept to say that APPARENTLY YOU **LIKE** HARD BOILED EGGS. I\u2019d love to know that something I raved over could be procured at nearly at time of the day with simple household ingredients and 30 seconds of prep time. What a gift for him.", "NTA.  It's not your responsibility to manage his diet", "ESH\n\nI think everyone has some responsibility to take care. You realized you were eating eggs and nice thing would\u2019ve been to have checked with him if he knew he was also eating eggs.\n\nBut if he\u2019s really going to be serious about not eating eggs unless they\u2019re baked and cookies or cake, he also needs to take responsibility for a double checking. He needs to ask: \u201cis this vegetarian friendly\u201d. He needs to ask: \u201care there eggs in this? That\u2019s what it means to be a responsible adult. \n\nYou\u2019re not his mother. You are his partner. As his partner, it would\u2019ve been nice for you to have given him a heads up out of consideration. As his partner, you\u2019re not responsible for policing all the food he decides to adjust if he\u2019s not even going to take the precautions that someone should take as a standard if they restrict their diet or are forced to restrict their diet", "YTA for waiting until after it was completely eaten to say anything. You either shouldn't have said anything or said something as soon as you realized. But knowingly letting him finish it and then saying something as you're leaving isn't cool, and probably seemed like some sort of shitty mind game.", "NAH\n\nHonestly, bringing it up after was totally unnecessary. But he's an adult and should really read menus better or ask if there are eggs. This sounds like more of a phobia of eggs or something since he only has a problem when he can see or smell them. \n\nJust, next time maybe say something immediately after noticing or nothing at all. He's a big boy, he'll figure it out. Or he won't, either way it isn't your responsibility.", "NTA. In my friend group there\u2019s a self proclaimed foodie that HATES venison. One day we\u2019re all sharing some venison jerky, he shows up drunk and sees the jerky and starts going off how much he loves home made jerky. He insists he eats the jerky and then says its amazing. This was 6 years ago. To this day, we\u2019ve never told him he ate venison. Every time he says how much he hates jerky our entire friend group laughs and gives the look.", "NTA. If he doesn't have an allergy or sensitivity and can't tell when a dish has eggs that he supposedly doesn't like that's not your problem.", "He doesn\u2019t eat eggs, unless he can\u2019t see or smell them? No, he eats eggs.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. I assume he doesn't eat eggs because he doesn't like the taste or the texture. The taste or texture of these particular eggs clearly didn't bother him, so what's the problem? Is there some kind of cash prize I don't know about that you win if you go 50 years without eating recognizable eggs?", "Why are you surprised at him being responsible for his own food choices?", "What a bizarre meal. I tried googling and couldn't find a recipe resembling this dish.", "As someone that has eggs in her list of problem foods I can definitely say you notice the texture especially when it comes to boiled eggs.", "But it isnt moral since he will eat them in cakes.", "Again it\u2019s am I am asshole, not am I technically in the right.\n\nIt costs what, 5 seconds, to say \u201cHey, that has eggs incase you didn\u2019t notice.\u201d? It would\u2019ve cost her nothing, and apparently brought him a lot of joy.\n\nAnd bringing it up later? I can\u2019t imagine why you would unless you\u2019re trying to be smug", "If you don't eat eggs that much you might not have \"the eye\" for them and to him it was unexpected.\n\n>yes his food choices are on him\n\nThis is true and not the point that is being argued. She does not need to be his egg-watcher. The point is that she noticed the eggs, she knows not-eating-eggs is important and she a) didn't stop him when she could and b) told about it when there was nothing he could do anymore.", "Next post: AITA for throwing up after my girlfriend told me a dish had eggs in it?", "Not telling him brought him joy and telling him then would have ruined his whole meal experience from the beginning.\n\nIt costs less than 5 seconds to check your food for a major ingredient. He could have brought himself joy.\n\nWhy are people expecting her to tell him in the first place? It's his rules.", "If his egg thing was truly important to him he would have been more careful about what he was eating and about to eat.", ">Brought him joy\n\nYou mean the temporary joy, that was then ruined by her saying \u201cOh yeah, it had eggs in it.\u201d At the end of eating?\n\n>Why should she have to tell him?\n\nBecause it costs her nothing\u2026 just as if he noticed something was in her food that she typically dislikes, it costs him nothing to tell her.\n\nDoes she have a legal responsibility to tell him? No, but I just don\u2019t see how you can find joy in watching your spouse unintentionally eat something they dislike.", "As said, he is bad at the egg thingy and making sure there are no eggs is his responsibility, but that wasn't the question.  The question was if OP is TA in this spesific situation and yes, she was. The NTA paths were: a) tell immediately about the eggs you just noticed or b) do not tell at all.", "She wouldn't have needed to say anything if he had been paying attention to what he was putting in his mouth.\n\nSo really op is NTA no matter the path. Because he's TA for not following his own rules and then getting offended about it."]}
