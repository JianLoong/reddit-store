I kind of felt bad while he was eating it but he said he enjoyed it and kept eating it so I didn\u2019t want to ruin his appetite. I think the only reason I may be an asshole was because I should\u2019ve let it go. I shouldn\u2019t have told him afterwards that he ate eggs. He felt like I was taunting him\u2026 but I wasn\u2019t! I just wanted him to be aware that he hate eggs and it was okay! He\u2019s always very dramatic about his food choices, so I wanted him to know that it was okay to eat eggs.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

How was the restaurant dish any different?  He didn't know he was eating eggs.  Not sure why you bothered to tell him though.", "NTA. If you could see them surely he should have been able to??  I mean most folks would have said hey do those chunks look like eggs?   I mean if he\u2019s not allergic and will eat them in cake and things he doesn\u2019t have a physical or moral reason he doesn\u2019t.  It\u2019s simply because he doesn\u2019t want to.   That falls into check your own food.", "NTA but WHY DID YOU BRING IT UP? That was particularly stupid of you.. just say that you were glad he enjoyed it or something", "You're NTA. He is a grown man.

You are not responsible for policing his food.", "NTA.\n\nSince it's HIS choice, it becomes HIS responsibility to let wait staff know about his dietary choices when he goes out.\n\nThe consequences of his own actions showed up, and you didn't stop them.  \n\nOne caveat, if this becomes a story you tell to embarrass him Infront of friends and family, then yes, you will be TA.", "nta.

He\u2019s an adult. He is responsible for what he puts in his mouth.", "NTA he isn't allergic. He'll eat eggs if in a cake. He clearly didn't know they were eggs and could not taste that they were eggs or whatever trigger he has. He is a grown man, and if he cares that much should be looking out for himself, esp as it is just a preference and not health related. You probably shouldn't have told him, but he also could have used that as an experience to reevaluate his dislike of eggs.", "NTA . He was free to notice the eggs himself, it's not like you hid them or tried to trick him into ordering something with hidden eggs in it.", "NTA but I'm so confused. It sounds like he doesn't eat eggs because he usually doesn't like the taste, and that's why he doesn't mind them in baked goods. If he was enjoying them in this dish, why on earth would you stop him? Am I missing something? If it's because he'd stop eating them on the principle that he doesn't like eggs then... wtf. \n\nI'm vegetarian, have an eating disorder, have sensory issues, and I have a disability that limits what I can eat during flare-ups. So I'm not shaming him for disliking a common food. There are a lot of common foods I don't like or eat. However, I understand that I need to eat to live, and when food is fun and delicious I eat more. So I keep trying foods I don't like or find ways to eat nutritious things that I'd normally avoid. Eating is a huge part of socializing and life so I do my best to make it easy for other people when they're hosting me or when we're out in a restaurant. If I ordered something in a restaurant not knowing it came with asparagus and then I ended up liking the asparagus, which I usually can't stand, I'd be thrilled. Why were you supposed to stop him from eating food he was enjoying? \n\nI'm sincerely asking, I'm autistic so maybe I've missed something obvious.", "Soft YTA\n\nNot for allowing him to eat the eggs. If you have certain dietary restrictions it is on you to ask if dishes contain those restricted items, always.\n\nHowever, there was no reason to bring it up after the fact. Letting him know that you realized and he didn't but you let him continue anyway seems off. Idk, it just feels like you wanted to rub it in his face.", "> I was a bit horrified but didn\u2019t say anything\n\n>he called me AH for not stopping him.\n\nOkay so the dude is somewhat inconsistant w the egg stuff (cake) but you were still horrified and he clearly would have wished that you had stopped him?\n\n>It wasn\u2019t until after we left that I asked if he realized what he ate\u2026\n\nWhy did you tell him? Was he raving how good it was and you had to say or what?\n\nImma go w YTA. Yes, he is bad with this no eggs thing but it apparently means a lot to him and you know that, so you not doing anything AND telling him afterwards \"guess what, you had eggs!\" is somewhat AH behaviour.", "NTA", "YTA for choosing to tell him what he ate afterward. You had two choices: keep your mouth shut (not OK if this were a moral objection or an allergy, but it sounds like it's a taste preference, and clearly he thought what he was eating tasted fine), or tell him when he could still choose to not eat the rest of the dish. You chose neither, and that seems pointlessly mean.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWatching him eat it and then telling him after the fact is the maximum assholish way to handle it.", "Lol YTA, you could\u2019ve stopped him, like I really don\u2019t understand your logic of \u201che was already eating it\u201d like you could\u2019ve stopped him at any point but you chose to drop the news on him after everything was said and done\n\nIt may seem like it\u2019s not a big deal but I do not blame him for calling you an asshole", "[deleted]", "YTA - so what if he started eating? He could\u2019ve simply\u2026stopped? And even so, why did you feel the need to bring it up afterwards? I don\u2019t get your reasoning here.", "YTA. You wouldn't be if you hadn't noticed,  but you did. Would it have been that difficult to say \n\n\"Hey, did you see there are eggs in that dish?\". \n\nAren't you supposed to like this person?", "YTA for choosing to mention this after the fact.  Your boyfriend is responsible for what he eats, but it would have been common courtesy to let him know he was eating eggs.", "YTA... kind of. He has no moral issues with eating eggs if he eats it in cake, he's not allergic, and he didn't seem to have an issue with the taste this time so there's no reason for him not to eat it, but you clearly remembered that this is something that bugs him, you noticed him eating them, and chose not to mention it anyways. Why? So what if he was already eating it, if you saw someone eating food that was spit in would you not mention it because they already started? That makes no sense, you chose to let him eat something that's gross to him for no reason. You don't have any obligation to tell him but as his partner you should want him to know what's going on and be honest with him, I don't understand why you made the conscious decision to leave him in the dark.", "YTA for letting him eat more and thus making it worse.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It was a runny sauce, not thick, so you could see the chopped eggs very clearly. I was very confused when he was eating them because the eggs were very prominent. It had probably 2 hard boiled eggs chopped up in there.", "I really don\u2019t understand this black and white thinking on this. Sure, it\u2019s HIS dietary choice but is it *wrong* to think your partner should tell you if they know to be nice?

Pointlessly", "Possibly because she thought he might make an issue of it with the restaurant, or her, in public. By sharing it after the fact, he could know not to order that next time since he will then know that eggs are in it", "Maybe he'll figure out that he doesn't hate pieces of egg in all contexts.  Maybe he'll avoid that dish in future.  She didn't ask aita for telling.  She asked if aita for not stopping him.  I don't see a problem with not stopping him.  He supposedly doesn't like eggs, so you'd think he'd notice he was eating a food he didn't like.", "My sister doesn\u2019t like cheese generally. If she ordered something that had cheese in it and didn\u2019t know, to me, the kind thing to do would be to let her know. And if she ends up liking it, great. If she stops eating it, also fine. Idk what harm that would do to me, and idk what harm that would\u2019ve done to OP in this situation. But I guess simple courtesy is out the window for this topic.\n\nAlso - OP and yourself already acknowledged he doesn\u2019t hate eggs in all contexts. He just doesn\u2019t want to eat eggs in other specific contexts. I don\u2019t see why it\u2019s a lesson he needs to learn as if it\u2019s a bad thing or crime that the man doesn\u2019t like eggs?"]}
