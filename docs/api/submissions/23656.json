I don't know much about the circumstances overall. I only know there is no father in the picture for this baby and no paternal family either. Oh, and that she's living with my dad and his wife again.\n\nSo my dad's wife called me up randomly a few days ago and told me that her daughters friends are not offering to throw her a baby shower and that as her sister, I would be the next best person to throw her one, because I am closer to her age group. She told me I have failed her daughter as a sister in the past by refusing to be her big sister and acting like I don't have a responsibility to her. This is where I can make it up to her and get off on good footing as an aunt.\n\nI told my dad's wife I would not be throwing her daughter a shower but she is more than free to and if I have the time available I might show up. She told me it wasn't good enough and I'm supposed to be her daughter's big sister, that she promised her a big sister. I told her she should have adopted an older girl OR found a husband with a daughter who wanted to be a big sister. I told her she married a man whose daughter had no interest in taking on the role and after 15 years it was time she accepted that. She told me that my behavior was worse than when I chose to stop going to my dad's house during his parenting time when I was 13. I told her I was okay with that.\n\nI thought we were done but yesterday she called again and I gave her the same answer; no. She called  me an asshole and told me I am hurting her daughter who is innocent in all of this.\n\nLate last night I got a message from, who I assume is her daughter but I can't be positive since I don't have the girls number, and she said she was sorry her mom was being pushy and she was sorry if I hated her but she would really love it if I wanted to even throw a shower with her. She said she could really use a big sister and she's always loved me even if I never loved or cared about her. It made me question if I was too harsh in saying no because she did hit the nail on the head, she always loved and admired me while I never loved or cared for her.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1690911584, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15fjaje/aita_for_telling_my_dads_wife_i_am_not_throwing/", "score": 130, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I feel like I might have been a little too harsh and dismissive in how I rejected it more than anything. But also, maybe I shouldn't have said no overall? Sounds like the girl is feeling very much alone and she's probably scared and would like something nice to celebrate her baby. I know how much SHE cares about me or wants me in her life and if she heard me say what I said, and say no so firmly, it might have been a lot for her.

Instead, counter with an offer to do lunch or something.  That's still a supportive \"big sis\" type thing with no commitment, and you can see how it goes before deciding if you want to continue a relationship with her or not.  It does sound like step-mom was poisoning your relationship by pressuring you and feeding her unrealistic expectations, so there is the possibility that as adults you can build something nice.  But only if you're interested in that route.  You have no obligation to her, and you're not required to be in her life just because of how she feels about you.

Maybe you can talk it over with her, without being forced to do something.", "She is guilt tripping you.", "YWNBTA, you are under no obligation to throw her one. If her mother is so adamant about it then why can't she just throw it herself and leave you with no involvement? \n\nI don't know the back story as to why you don't care for the step sister, but sounds like the mother was the one texting you and trying to use emotional manipulation to make you throw the shower.", "NTA\n\nI feel bad for your step-sister, seems like all her peers have abandoned her and she's reaching out.

Your SM and dad sound tiresome, but she seems like an innocent party in the whole situation, same as you. You in no way have to throw her a party, but you might think about keeping the lines of communication open with her.", "NTA. The message from stepsister was probably egged on by her mom.

If the mother is being this pushy, let her throw the damn shower. It doesn't sound like there is that much to celebrate, honestly.", "NTA\n\n.... in this situation, it would be assumed the grandmother to be would throwing it.

I don't know much about the circumstances overall. I only know there is no father in the picture for this baby and no paternal family either. Oh, and that she's living with my dad and his wife again.\n\nSo my dad's wife called me up randomly a few days ago and told me that her daughters friends are not offering to throw her a baby shower and that as her sister, I would be the next best person to throw her one, because I am closer to her age group. She told me I have failed her daughter as a sister in the past by refusing to be her big sister and acting like I don't have a responsibility to her. This is where I can make it up to her and get off on good footing as an aunt.\n\nI told my dad's wife I would not be throwing her daughter a shower but she is more than free to and if I have the time available I might show up. She told me it wasn't good enough and I'm supposed to be her daughter's big sister, that she promised her a big sister. I told her she should have adopted an older girl OR found a husband with a daughter who wanted to be a big sister. I told her she married a man whose daughter had no interest in taking on the role and after 15 years it was time she accepted that. She told me that my behavior was worse than when I chose to stop going to my dad's house during his parenting time when I was 13. I told her I was okay with that.\n\nI thought we were done but yesterday she called again and I gave her the same answer; no. She called  me an asshole and told me I am hurting her daughter who is innocent in all of this.\n\nLate last night I got a message from, who I assume is her daughter but I can't be positive since I don't have the girls number, and she said she was sorry her mom was being pushy and she was sorry if I hated her but she would really love it if I wanted to even throw a shower with her. She said she could really use a big sister and she's always loved me even if I never loved or cared about her. It made me question if I was too harsh in saying no because she did hit the nail on the head, she always loved and admired me while I never loved or cared for her.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I don\u2019t know the details to your relationship with everyone involved, so of course my feelings and response are going to reflect that lack of knowledge. \n\nI\u2019m not saying to throw the baby shower, but maybe it wouldn\u2019t hurt to get to know her? You definitely don\u2019t have to get along with mom-zilla, but her daughter is kind of innocent. I feel like after so long of no relationship a baby shower is just asking WAY too much, but maybe a quiet dinner of the two of you just going out and quietly celebrating the baby?

Often, I think etiquette rules line up with politeness, but in this case I think it is purely an issue of image. \n\nSince relationships are all different, there are friends with a relationship as close as sisters and there are sisters who are like strangers. \n\nIf a \u201cgift grab\u201d is socially unacceptable, then it should be considered bad etiquette for any expecting mother to consent to it. \n\nIf a \u201cgift grab\u201d is socially accepted, then it shouldn\u2019t matter who hosts it. \n\nIs a mother less worthy of gifts just because her friends may not have the resources to throw a shower (I.e. they are young adults with little income and limited space to host)? After all, people receive an invitation and not a summons. \n\nIt\u2019s a shame that the people who are perhaps most in need of extra support are tacky by default because their support system is less affluent. \n\nHowever, there are social circles where image is particularly valued. More generously, there are people that value tradition, and I don\u2019t seek to rob anyone of traditions, so long as they aren\u2019t hurting anyone. \n\nI suppose I would simply encourage some grace extended to the individuals whose circumstances are less fortunate.\n\nNone of this is relevant to OP, who is NTA, btw \ud83d\ude02", "A savior??
