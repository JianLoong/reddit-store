I don't know much about the circumstances overall. I only know there is no father in the picture for this baby and no paternal family either. Oh, and that she's living with my dad and his wife again.\n\nSo my dad's wife called me up randomly a few days ago and told me that her daughters friends are not offering to throw her a baby shower and that as her sister, I would be the next best person to throw her one, because I am closer to her age group. She told me I have failed her daughter as a sister in the past by refusing to be her big sister and acting like I don't have a responsibility to her. This is where I can make it up to her and get off on good footing as an aunt.\n\nI told my dad's wife I would not be throwing her daughter a shower but she is more than free to and if I have the time available I might show up. She told me it wasn't good enough and I'm supposed to be her daughter's big sister, that she promised her a big sister. I told her she should have adopted an older girl OR found a husband with a daughter who wanted to be a big sister. I told her she married a man whose daughter had no interest in taking on the role and after 15 years it was time she accepted that. She told me that my behavior was worse than when I chose to stop going to my dad's house during his parenting time when I was 13. I told her I was okay with that.\n\nI thought we were done but yesterday she called again and I gave her the same answer; no. She called  me an asshole and told me I am hurting her daughter who is innocent in all of this.\n\nLate last night I got a message from, who I assume is her daughter but I can't be positive since I don't have the girls number, and she said she was sorry her mom was being pushy and she was sorry if I hated her but she would really love it if I wanted to even throw a shower with her. She said she could really use a big sister and she's always loved me even if I never loved or cared about her. It made me question if I was too harsh in saying no because she did hit the nail on the head, she always loved and admired me while I never loved or cared for her.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1690911584, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15fjaje/aita_for_telling_my_dads_wife_i_am_not_throwing/", "score": 2565, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I feel like I might have been a little too harsh and dismissive in how I rejected it more than anything. But also, maybe I shouldn't have said no overall? Sounds like the girl is feeling very much alone and she's probably scared and would like something nice to celebrate her baby. I know how much SHE cares about me or wants me in her life and if she heard me say what I said, and say no so firmly, it might have been a lot for her.

Instead, counter with an offer to do lunch or something.  That's still a supportive \"big sis\" type thing with no commitment, and you can see how it goes before deciding if you want to continue a relationship with her or not.  It does sound like step-mom was poisoning your relationship by pressuring you and feeding her unrealistic expectations, so there is the possibility that as adults you can build something nice.

I don't know much about the circumstances overall. I only know there is no father in the picture for this baby and no paternal family either. Oh, and that she's living with my dad and his wife again.\n\nSo my dad's wife called me up randomly a few days ago and told me that her daughters friends are not offering to throw her a baby shower and that as her sister, I would be the next best person to throw her one, because I am closer to her age group. She told me I have failed her daughter as a sister in the past by refusing to be her big sister and acting like I don't have a responsibility to her. This is where I can make it up to her and get off on good footing as an aunt.\n\nI told my dad's wife I would not be throwing her daughter a shower but she is more than free to and if I have the time available I might show up. She told me it wasn't good enough and I'm supposed to be her daughter's big sister, that she promised her a big sister. I told her she should have adopted an older girl OR found a husband with a daughter who wanted to be a big sister. I told her she married a man whose daughter had no interest in taking on the role and after 15 years it was time she accepted that. She told me that my behavior was worse than when I chose to stop going to my dad's house during his parenting time when I was 13. I told her I was okay with that.\n\nI thought we were done but yesterday she called again and I gave her the same answer; no. She called  me an asshole and told me I am hurting her daughter who is innocent in all of this.\n\nLate last night I got a message from, who I assume is her daughter but I can't be positive since I don't have the girls number, and she said she was sorry her mom was being pushy and she was sorry if I hated her but she would really love it if I wanted to even throw a shower with her. She said she could really use a big sister and she's always loved me even if I never loved or cared about her. It made me question if I was too harsh in saying no because she did hit the nail on the head, she always loved and admired me while I never loved or cared for her.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I don\u2019t know the details to your relationship with everyone involved, so of course my feelings and response are going to reflect that lack of knowledge. \n\nI\u2019m not saying to throw the baby shower, but maybe it wouldn\u2019t hurt to get to know her? You definitely don\u2019t have to get along with mom-zilla, but her daughter is kind of innocent.

These kids do not develop a love for ALL of their classmates. Just because they spend a lot of time together does not mean a bond will develop. Just because their father clearly loves somebody does not mean the child also has to love that person. The change itself is hard enough, but when you actively try to force a toddler on an eight year old who is still processing all this change they are going to be the opposite of receptive. It's actually perfectly natural for their brain to protect them like that, because the changes up to this have not been positive in the child's eyes. She coped.

Maybe they wouldn't have a close relationship, but they would at least have an understanding. \n\nThe only thing \"unhealthy\" about all this is the stepmom trying to shove sisterhood down both of their throats. And STILL doing it. It's been fifteen years, she's not suddenly going to have sisterly feelings for this girl and she absolutely should not lie about it. The girl probably needs therapy, but not over her lack of relationship with a kid who was always pushed at her. Moreso for how all that pushing and forcing affected her as a young developing girl whose security likely already felt threatened by her parents split. Children are humans with all the human emotions but none of the experience to know that these things happen and that it will heal eventually, they just know that things are awful NOW. When things are awful, do you feel like leaving your comfort zone and risking more awful? I don't and I'm a little bit bigger than most kids. They're getting so big these days! I swear every kid I know is a little giant! Almost like.... What are you feeding these things?! \n\nBut anyway... Yeah. Not all things blend together without completely losing their own properties.

The point is to give them stuff they can't really afford to buy for themselves, to help them get a good start in life.\n\nMy family thinks it's \"uncouth\" to give money or useful gifts.
