She's a teacher. She makes a little over 60k. I make about 100k.\n\nThe 5 years thing is just a general idea. Realistically what I want is to pay down the non-federal loans. But at the end of the day all I want is to have some level of financial security where we won't be completely fucked if I lose my job, so as long as we can get there then it's all good. \n\nMy sister recently had a kid, two of my friends are pregnant, and I'm down to join the dad squad. I'm not putting this off because I'm not ready, I'm putting it off because not being completely financially fucked is more important to me than having a kid.\n\nAdditionally, thanks for the advice so far. I'm reading everything and will respond when I can. \n\nI like the idea of getting a fertility test and will definitely be incorporating that into the plan.\n\nOne more thing I want to add: this plan is just something I'm putting together to bring to the table ahead of time. I'd like to be able to sit down and say listen I didn't realize we had this much debt, I'd like to at least get it to something manageable before trying for a kid, here's how I think we can go about that.\n\n# ORIGINAL POST:\n\nMy wife has wanted to have kids for a while and I've been putting it off, but now that I'm 30 (the age my parents had me) the idea has grown on me a bit. So earlier this year I told her we could probably start trying in 2024.\n\nThat said, I've been asking my wife for access to her student loan accounts for a while now. She just keeps putting it off and I've kind of let her since she's generally responsible with money. Last week I finally forced her to give it to me since I said we wouldn't be able to start trying for a baby until I've looked at her accounts to get a full picture of our finances.\n\nAnyway, what I saw pretty much sunk my battleship. Not only is there a lot more debt than I thought, there were multiple private loans, including one for 20k on a variable rate interest (currently about 9%).\n\nI did some math and the total principal across all her loans is a little over 90k. This includes credit cards and car. I estimated the total payments to about $150k over 10Y if we were to continue to make the minimum payment like she does.\n\nI've basically put together a plan (that I haven't told her yet) which is along the lines of:  \n1. I'm going to sell some stock and pay off her credit card ASAP.  \n2. She's going to have to start working in the summer (she's a teacher)  \n3. Once my car loan is paid off next year, I'll start putting those payments towards the principal balance of the variable rate loan.  \n\nOver 5 years we should be able to pay off all the loans that are above 6% interest and lower the monthly payments by about 75%. Basically get rid of all the high interest private loans and just continue to slowly pay down the federal loans.\n\nI just know she's going to get very upset and it's going to start a big fight about how I said we could start trying, but it seems insane to me to have a kid with that much debt especially when we already have practically no savings.\n\nSo WIBTA to delay having a baby for 5 years because of money?\n\nI don't think I would, but I know she's going to think I am. I feel like I'm just being pragmatic about it.\n\nExtra info I'm sure people will ask about:\n\nOur finances are basically entirely separate. This is because I pay for rent, utilities, groceries, date nights, etc. We have a joint account, but rarely use it for anything since there's no joint expenses.\n\nWe've been married about a year. Together for 8.\n\nMy wife wanted to get married and have kids like 5 years ago and I had pushed it off for a while.", "created_utc": 1695154370, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16n131o/wibta_if_i_put_off_having_kids_for_5_years/", "score": 230, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your wife is strait up bad with money if you pay the major bills and she's still paying the min on her loan while running up credit card debt. You guys have no savings and she wants to bring kids into the equation? Come on. You can barely afford life for just the 2 of you. \n\nPut the loan repayments to the side for the moment.  First, you two need to sit down with the last year of credit card and bank statements to figure out what the hell you spent 2 full time salaries on to have no savings left. Either one or both of you is spending way too much. Start there, bc if you don't fix that, the debt will just come back.  \n\nAfter that, discuss a budget. After that, discuss how to get rid of all the debt.  \n\nBe prepared to go slow and expect an outburst or two. This stuff is hard to talk about for many people.  \n\nBut, to answer your question: NTA. It's a terrible idea to have kids when your finances are a mess.", "NTA.\n\nBeing financially responsible is a GOOD thing!  Yeah, she may be upset, but she also incurred all that debt.  You've got a plan and you're even willing to put your money towards her debts (which if predating your marriage are not in your name even).  And this is a good plan, and she obviously knew this would be an issue since she's been holding out on telling you for so long.  You want some savings and not a mountain of debt before starting with kids.\n\nGood luck.", "Your wife has run up a lot of debt. Were the loans before you got together or were they behind your back?\n\nYou should not bring a child into the world you cannot afford. You have a plan.\n\nNTA", "Your wife is a teacher. She should qualify for PSLF after ten years of service.", "She should have been working summers already to pay that stuff down, I don't understand why she hasn't been doing this to begin with. Minimum payments basically keeps you away from creditors but does little annually to reduce the debt.  Obviously she is financially irresponsible, and has no interest in stepping up without direction.  I think you are being totally responsible in your plan and she has no room to criticize or be angry about it. NTA", "INFO: you stated that you're 30, but how old is your wife? I still don't think this would make you TA unless she's coming up against her biological clock quickly, but I think it's still pertinent to the overall equation...", "Wait... you're paying all of the day to day living expenses and date nights--- what is she paying for?  Why hasn't she been paying on her loans with all the money she's not spending supporting herself?", "INFO: Am I correctly reading that you have assumed responsibility for all of your household bills? If so, why is she not contributing financially?", "I hate when people frame relationship questions as AITA questions because that's missing the point and doesn't fix anything unless the answer is to break up.  Both of you need to stop \"putting things off\" and start making decisions.  She needs to reign in her spending problems.  You need to stop being na\u00efve about it.  You may need to consider dispensing with the fiction of separate finances if you're actually paying her debt off.\n\nAt no point in your post do you mention your income or how much this debt will affect your lives with or without kids.  There are many tradeoffs with having kids sooner or later.", "You would be insane to have a kid without getting that under control. She's going to be out of work before, during, and after childbirth, you'll have more hospital bills on top of that for the birth. So you'll be more in debt, and will have less income, sounds like a very good recipe for disaster.\n\nNTA, but you really need to talk her through why it is how it is - she could've been working to pay off those debts but she hasn't, doesn't sound like she does much aside from running up more debt.\n\nSeriously, she's had these debts, refused to let you know about them, and has only done the bare minimum on them while racking more up, on top of not finding work in the summer... if she's good with money I'm not seeing it.", "NTA\n\nBut get ready for the deluge of tears and recriminations.\n\nWhen my Ex and I married I discovered just how much in debt she was with student loans. So I grabbed the bull by the horns and began paying 10X what the monthly payments were. Our combined income at the time was about $35K (circa 1985).  My goal was to buy a home and then start the family, so before the student loan discovery we were looking at about 18 months and we would be able to start. With the student loan, that goal was pushed out to five years. So guess what, five months later she waltzes in with a shit eating grin and poses the question, \"Guess What?\" I had just come off the fifth 12 hour shift working voluntary overtime in an effort to speed up the pay off of her student loans. When I did not guess it correctly she announced to me she was pregnant. Damn was I smoked. Long story short, the loans were paid off, and then the two credit cards she had hid from me.\n\n25 years later she walked in and told me she wanted a divorce. I live in a state were your spouse can pull credit cards and you are none the wiser And when property settlement occurs, statute leaves each person responsible for 50% of marital debt. I want tell you how much debt she had run up, but it was over my annual income at the time.\n\nNow my advice. If your wife likes to live on the edge financially, you are in for a life time of living hell.  Now is the time to decide if you want to live like this for the next 40 years or if you rather let her financially implode on her own. It does not get any better.", "NTA for delaying having kids but you would be if you followed through with your plan. Here is why!!! Your wife doesn\u2019t have a debt problem she has a spending problem. She loves to spend but doesn\u2019t love to pay for the things. If you rush in to speed up the process by cashing out stocks and bonds, then start throwing your money at everything of hers to get it paid off\u2026she has learned a valuable less. That less?!?! She doesn\u2019t have to pay her debt bc you will. You pay the mortgage. You pay the utilities. You pay for groceries. You pay for date nights. You pay for your car. You pay for everything but her car. She is a teacher for crying out loud. That means she makes at least 40k a year. After taxes it\u2019s easily 30k a year. If you are paying for everything while she is creating debt\u2026you are being used. And here you are going to pick up her chaos. No no no. Until she learns to pay off her own debt you will be in this situation forever. SHE needs to throw everything at it she can. She needs to give up everything.", "NTA, now that the cat is out of the bag, you are being pragmatic.  For those who say it\u2019s never a good time financially to have children, those people have never had to take in family with children because they couldn\u2019t make ends meet and pay their bills\u2026the other issue older generations never dealt with how important credit scores are for everything.  \nI feel qualified to talk about this because I have a front row seat to this exact situation\u2026only 30 yrs later.  \nMy sister in law, also a teacher, is 61.  She has $75,000 in student debt.  So she says\u2026she won\u2019t show my brother the statements either, they\u2019ve been married 35 yrs.  She\u2019s accrued hers thru her masters program and being stupid and co-signing for their children\u2019s loans( both flunked out, left her with the bills.  This was after my brother pleaded with her not to do it.\nNow they are near retirement age, and unless they sell their house, they will never get out from under her bad choices.  And just like your wife, she spends her summers at her dads pool, and hanging out there.  My brother doesn\u2019t seem to get that her debt is his debt, and her bad credit score is why they can\u2019t get a newer car on a loan without a high interest rate.\n\nI think you are right, having children together requires another level of commitment, responsibility, and transparency that your wife needs to be agreeable to\u2026.or you will end up with nothing like my brother.", "Howcome you didn\u2019t find this massive black hole earlier? It appears you have a good sense of finance and money management.  \nI think your kid plan is not out of order.  \nGood luck.", "Nta. Kids are expensive so starting a family while in debt, planned isn't really ideal.", "NTA\nMake sure your contraception is tamper proof.", "NTA at all.  You are being smart.  Wife and I are both in nice paying STEM fields.  Waited 8 years until after marriage for our daughter.  Allowed us to wipe out my student loans in advance and then be able to afford to give our daughter lots of experiences and opportunities.  Having kids is much easier when you are not struggling financially.", "NTA\n\nDid you ask why she took these private loans? She is \"responsible with money\", she works and you pay for majority of living costs, so it seems strange... If she has any hidden problems (like addictions), your plan won't work.", "She straight up lied to your ass. My finances are 100% separate from my wife's, but everything that costs more than a paycheck is a discussion. We need to be on the same page so we can retire together, etc.", ">This is because I pay for rent, utilities, groceries, date nights, etc.\n\nShe has 90K in loans when she works and you pay everything? She's 28. What has she been doing? I wouldn't want kids with her. I would consider this marriage partially fraudulent since she basically underplayed how much she owed. How do people not cover this before marriage? NTA.", "So your bigger problem is that \n- your wife has debt and was cagey about discussing it with you \n- she and family are potentially financially illiterate \n- you think she's likely to get defensive and angry if you ask her to manage her debt responsibly \n\nThe fertility issue for delaying kids is absolutely a concern and may be feeding her emotions around this. \n\nI would consider the following \n- if she's NOT willing to take steps to manage money better including improving her income with a second job, are YOU ok managing it for her and will she let you do this? Are you going to resent this as an unequal partnership down the line? \n- is she likely to resent / blame you if you delay children then start having issues when you try to conceive? \n\nAll in all, you're in tiger country. Lots here to navigate. It might be worth getting an outside objective opinion to break the news to her / support or improve your plan. It might also help her if she sees you start building a \"child fund\". So a dedicated bank account where you're putting away money as she pays down debts so it's a team exercise building your towards financial stability and children.", "I can\u2019t judge because I\u2019m sitting here stunned by the idea of a 20 something teacher making 60k. Insert mind blown emoji here.\n\nObviously my teacher kid lives in the wrong state.", "NTA- but why did you wait until after marriage to look at your finances? It seems like you had excuses 5 years ago, she might be concerned that five years from now you will have more excuses.

If she wants kids sooner, she could always get a second job to help pay down the debt.", "NTA \n\nPeople are going to roast me by saying this but this is why it\u2019s best for finances to be combined. Statistically, it\u2019s proven that married couples with combined finances have better marriages. You say you\u2019ve been together for 8 years and you\u2019re just finding out now how much debt she has? That\u2019s crazy to me because if you would have known, you both could have come up with this aggressive plan to pay it off years ago and probably would have it all paid off years ago. And now you will probably have to delay starting a family when you\u2019re both not getting any younger.

We are both excellent with money and hard working so we aren\u2019t too worried about having kids soon. It\u2019s one thing to have debt and be actively paying it back and working a ton and saving money every second. It doesn\u2019t sound like she is very responsible. I want kids badly so I have sacrificed fun stuff and buckled down the hatches sort of speak to save every penny we can and work every second we can.

My guess is she thought this would be your reaction to her debt so she delayed letting you know maybe hoping age would push you to take that step.

This approach takes the pressure off of you for being the \u2018bad guy\u2019. The hope is that having an unbiased third party explain it to her she will seriously understand the issues her spending has caused and it won\u2019t be coming from her husband who \u2018just doesn\u2019t want to have kids\u2019.", "NTA since finances are separate tell wife that either starting now rent utilities groceries and household expenses will be split 50 50 each will be responsible for personal bills phone car payment and insurance and personal expenses.

First, all of these discussions about money should have taken place BEFORE they got married, or at least when they first started discussing having children.

Second, they make a combined $160K year, and if they have no savings on that income then they are both living beyond their means, not just her.

Third, OP didn\u2019t even look to see what kind of student loan debt relief his wife might be eligible for, especially since she is a teacher and will definitely qualify for something. It may not help with all of the student loan debt, but is better than just jumping in and trying to pay for all of it. He needs to research all available options before making any kind of plan. Fourth, has OP even talked to his wife about any of this, or had a discussion about how to best tackle the debt? That should be a decision they make together, not something he makes unilaterally without her input and then holds over her head so they can have a baby.\n\nFor these reasons, I think this is a YTA situation, because OP is putting all the blame on his wife and trying to dictate what she \u201cneeds\u201d to do before he\u2019ll consider getting her pregnant.", "Are you a Dave Ramsey fan/listener?

My egg production was the root cause of my fertility issue, and it\u2019s a good thing I got them when we did, because they would only go down in quality over time.

She pays no major bills and yet seems to be unable to pay down small or larger debt. Thus, you don\u2019t know where her money is going. \n2. Since you don\u2019t know where her money is going, your partnership is not financially secure enough or full enough with trust to have children. \n3. When she can explain where her money is going and you can sit together and come up with a plan together for everything to be paid down, the potential for having children in the future is back on the table. \n4.

A lot of private college loan companies can be pretty predatory and talk 18yo's into taking out a LOT more than they potentially need...\n\nbut I would like more info on what is happening in terms of her having a budget and her own plan on how she's paying these debts down NOW.\n\nThe Federal Loans are a different matter, and smart to not pay more than minimum, as there may be some debt relief in the future, and if nothing else, if she does the Public Service Loan Forgiveness she only has to pay for 10 years before the rest is \"forgiven\"...  but if she doesn't currently have an active plan to pay down her private debt, that's a HUGE red flag for me.", "My thoughts exactly.", "My cousin had her FIRST kid at 40, there isn't some magic age where all women just stop being unable to conceive, I always thought that argument was silly. I know people who had kids in their 50s and later. Definitely best to check in with doctors once you hit 35 but overall we've come a long way, never understood the argument.

My husband and I were always fence sitters but we finally bought a house and felt like our finances were \"under control\" when I was 34.

Which is automatically considered high risk with my birth center and required monthly ultrasounds. Do you know what is not covered under global maternity benefits in the US? Ultrasounds. Each ultrasound was billed at around $500  because they charge you for the second baby. I was also medically required to have a C-section so add an anesthesiologist to the mix. Oh, plus each twin had their own dedicated nursing team for when they were born. For fun we added on a 5 day hospital stay for me and one twin decided that was cool and spent those days in the NICU. \n\nWe were lucky that we had a well funded HSA from my pre-baby job and my husband's union medical benefits so it wasn't financially devastating for us.  But there are medical policies out there with 5k or 10k deductibles. That means the person pays that much out of pocket before their benefits even kick in. So while it didn't \"explode\" your budget it's very likely that it might for others.", "Yeah, this is where I come down as well. As long as there is a plan in place for managing the debt and they're working toward it, they should be able to factor other expenses (e.g., a kid) into it.", "I had no idea how different my body was until I went through it.  The fertile fluid there at every single period as a teen, and the marked lack of it at half in my mid 30s. I had my last kid at 35 and he got a vasectomy but my fertile fluid difference was stark. It's not in our heads. Fertility wanes. Not saying it's a big deal for OP- I certainly wouldn't want to have kids with that kind of insane debt. \n\nI hope your IVF worked out?"]}
