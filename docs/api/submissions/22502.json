If you prefaced it, I\u2019d say N T A for this particular instance, but if you didn\u2019t it\u2019s on you. And either way, physically covering her mouth was way over the line.

Are you and everyone else present when you are with grandma, or do you spend most of your time on your phone?  In an emergency, grandma should be understanding and be quiet.  Think about your phone use.  Do you consider the person/people you are physically with the priority?  Would you answer a call in every circumstance?  I think it is polite to be present for the physical person.  The phone person, in most circumstances, can wait. Obviously, this situation was important.   Consider if you are being polite to your grandma.  When I am with people, I send a quick text ... I'm with people,  can I call you back? ..... I think grandma is being rude because she feels neglected.", "ESH. Your grandmother is trying to prove something about our addiction to phones, and while she may have a point, it's a losing battle.

Families often hug or use human touch as affection organically....cant fathom saying to my brothers or mom, hey can I hug you? Can I touch your arm while in conversation? Lol\n I get it that covering the mouth was a bit much....but I will give allowances for cultural habits. Sone cultures are way more touchy than others. Example older siblings all joking around and one starts to joke about spilling an old secret to mom, a  mouth gets covered, a head hold takes place, that's not unusual for family with friendly banter. \nIn op case, grandma just played her ridiculous  card one to many times.", "They were in a car though?

They tried over and over to get her to stop talking but granny wasnt having it.

It's especially traumatic and the friend might not have had anyone else to turn to. Especially if the person might try to return.\n\nHowever, they shouldn't have put their hands on their grandma.

And based on OP seeming to care for grandma it wasn\u2019t a Hulk Hogan headlock, it was probably a gentle hand over her mouth so she would be quiet. \n\nI totally get not physically assaulting someone but there is a time and a place to prove a point. And let\u2019s be clear, grandma is being an ass to prove her point that she thinks taking/making/being on the phone while with her is rude.", "Gotta admit I laughed", "\ud83d\ude06", "This was exactly my thought after seeing my MIL get it.  Long before she started having issues remembering things, there were personality changes.  She lost her verbal filter (hoo boy did that cause family drama!), she got ruder, paranoid, demanding, etc.\n\nGrandma needs to be evaluated by a doctor ASAP.", "I guess the solution would be to open the door then tuck and roll right on out of there? Jump out at the next red light and run for the hills?", "Tuck and roll? I don\u2019t know, people on this subreddit are fucking wild sometimes.", "Their life wasn't currently in danger and you had nothing to do with it, so once again, the \"I had to\" thing you're going for just isn't there. In that moment, it was just talk you wanted to hear.", "This subreddit has a serious problem with being way too pro-violence. As long as the other person was being sufficiently annoying, anyone here can have a chorus of people tell them they were justified in their physical actions. Some of ya'll are just losers who fantasize about being able to punch your bullies and get a pat on the back for it. Violence is not the answer. Putting your hand over an elderly person's mouth for an extended period of time is an act of violence.", "Force? Did she flog her?

Old people are not immune from fuck around and find out.", "The situation wasn't active and it seems like it hadn't been for a while considering OP had missed multiple calls and dozens of texts. Yes, being scared is understandable, but it's not an emergency. And if it was a true emergency like it being an active situation or being injured, the friend made a stupid choice calling OP rather than help. \n\nBut the friend just wanted to talk to someone until she calmed down. That's not an emergency.", "For sure! That's why it was just a soft YTA", "I'm not going to give you the benefit of the doubt and assume there's just a bit of lack of contextual understanding. An encounter like that happening outside of your own home means it could happen again. Yeah, no shit I wanted to hear if she was okay", "I don't really understand calling it gossip just on the basis that OP had nothing to do with her friend's robbery. If anything I would hope she had nothing to do with it", "I agree, OP was TA for that. That was wrong. But it's just reductive to say what happened to her friend is just gossip..", "Hey now. The comment I replied to said force. I didn't say it was.", "I don't think anyone should be, but I didn't make the rules.", "Ah, I was thinking it may have been a more recent event. You'd be surprised how quickly you can try calling/texting in a short time span.\n\nI'd assume law would have been called just before op. Anyway, ESH", "I'll say it again: you physically assaulted your own grandmother. That was an act of violence. Your actions were not justified.", "It\u2019s definitely not just gossip lol. Don\u2019t listen to the other poster. Your friend needed emotional support even if she wasn\u2019t in immediate physical danger anymore. That\u2019s a traumatic experience. If there\u2019s a person - especially a woman - especially young - who can go through something that scary and be just fine immediately, I would love to meet them because I think they don\u2019t exist. \n\nWhat I will say about your grandma though is that there\u2019s a possibility she is super lonely and that\u2019s why she feels the need to talk nonstop. If you feel like that\u2019s the case, maybe that makes it easier for you to feel sympathy for her and reach out more often/encourage other family members to. Another possibility is that she is just old. Especially if she doesn\u2019t work and hasn\u2019t for some time, maybe it\u2019s simply the fact that she has spent most of her life living in a completely different reality as far as technology and communication goes and she hasn\u2019t adapted to the current reality that we are expected to be available within a short amount of time, especially if it\u2019s obvious someone is really trying to reach you. When she was young it might have been expected that you ignore the phone during dinner and while visiting with relatives. In 2023, that mentality isn\u2019t easy to maintain anymore. I have older relatives who get upset that i take work calls and don\u2019t seem to understand that if I don\u2019t respond I could get fired. But she might not understand that.\n\nETA: obviously you shouldn\u2019t have covered her mouth. I think the other commenters covered that well enough though", "It had nothing to do with the grandmother either, who didn't deserve to be physically assaulted over it?", "For the purposes of this situation, it was. It's a red herring to distract from the actual topic at hand. She attacked her grandmother. The content of that call doesn't change that.", "Thank you for this perspective"]}
