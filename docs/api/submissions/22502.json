That's not an emergency.", "For sure! That's why it was just a soft YTA", "I'm not going to give you the benefit of the doubt and assume there's just a bit of lack of contextual understanding.

Don\u2019t listen to the other poster. Your friend needed emotional support even if she wasn\u2019t in immediate physical danger anymore. That\u2019s a traumatic experience. If there\u2019s a person - especially a woman - especially young - who can go through something that scary and be just fine immediately, I would love to meet them because I think they don\u2019t exist. \n\nWhat I will say about your grandma though is that there\u2019s a possibility she is super lonely and that\u2019s why she feels the need to talk nonstop. If you feel like that\u2019s the case, maybe that makes it easier for you to feel sympathy for her and reach out more often/encourage other family members to. Another possibility is that she is just old. Especially if she doesn\u2019t work and hasn\u2019t for some time, maybe it\u2019s simply the fact that she has spent most of her life living in a completely different reality as far as technology and communication goes and she hasn\u2019t adapted to the current reality that we are expected to be available within a short amount of time, especially if it\u2019s obvious someone is really trying to reach you. When she was young it might have been expected that you ignore the phone during dinner and while visiting with relatives. In 2023, that mentality isn\u2019t easy to maintain anymore. I have older relatives who get upset that i take work calls and don\u2019t seem to understand that if I don\u2019t respond I could get fired. But she might not understand that.\n\nETA: obviously you shouldn\u2019t have covered her mouth. I think the other commenters covered that well enough though", "It had nothing to do with the grandmother either, who didn't deserve to be physically assaulted over it?", "For the purposes of this situation, it was. It's a red herring to distract from the actual topic at hand. She attacked her grandmother. The content of that call doesn't change that.", "Thank you for this perspective", "YTA You could have put your finger in your ear rather than your hand over her mouth. How rude. I don't know why grandma wants to be around people who come to visit and then spend time on their phone. Maybe she wouldn't appear so needy if you actually paid attention to her and not your phone. You'll have great laughs to share about grandma and the phone thing when she's gone. Obviously, you've not lost someone who you would give anything to hear their voice again, irritating or not. Count yourself lucky.", "YTA - if you are visiting with someone, you don't take phone calls in front of them, it's rude.  Especially when visiting someone, like your grandma, who has repeatedly expressed to you that they don't like it and don't want you to do it.  You know that 'boundary' word people like to throw around, she has repeatedly told you not to do something and you are ignoring her boundary.  Stop it.  The world will not end if you ignore a call or text.  Or, you politely excuse yourself and answer in another room or outside, not in front of her and walk away after starting the conversation.  As for the cab situation, you had already missed the calls.  You should have waited until you were out of the cab to call back, or simply texted.  Or maybe try saying, hey Grandma, so and so has called and texted several times, I'm going to call her back to make sure everything is ok.  But you didn't.  Regardless, you don't put your hands on another person like that, period, full stop.  You committed battery.  The cab driver could have called the cops on you.", "ESH - while in this instance it seemed urgent you still physically silenced another person. If it was a man doing this to a woman everyone would be losing their s**t. You and your family have a habit of interrupting your social visits/events with phone calls. Which is also rude. Maybe have some ground rules about using phones during family get togethers would help everyone. Also keep your hands to yourself.", "Yes, yta , probably been one to her your whole life, I remember when you were 3 and she was on the phone and wouldn\u2019t shut up. Y\u2019all need to give that woman a hug", "YTA . I can't imagine an occasion when I would ever put my hand over someone's mouth to silence them.  Why is this in your repertoire?  You physically assaulted your grandmother, it's shocking, disrespectful behaviour.\n You talk of your grandmother having no manners yet you say when you visit her that you make phone calls in her living room. While you are on a visit? \nYou managed to ignore your friends calls and texts while you were out, presumably that suited you, but you couldn't wait a few more minutes until you got home before calling her. Again disrespectful to your grandmother.   You could have texted until you got home.  There was nothing you could have done physically to help your friend, if she was still in danger then she should be on the phone to the police.", "I can imagine PUTTING MY HAND OVER my grandmothers mouth, because I was on the phone!

That is despicable behaviour.\n\nAs to the phone thing, basic manners is not to take or make calls while you are with others.  Your grandma is interrupting you to teach you some bloody manners.  Take the phone to a private location and then call, don't have it in the livingroom of her house while you are supposedly visiting her.  Don't make a call while you are in a small car with her, speak with her or STFU.\n\nIf you didn't habitually ignore and exclude her while in her company then maybe she'd be more inclined to accept \"please don't interrupt this is urgent\".  Of couse you had no idea if it was indeed urgent, all you knew is someone else wanted to talk to you.", "ESH. Yes she's annoying, but you putting your hands on her is NOT RIGHT.  And everyone on here saying that's ok is also wrong. That's assault, and on an elder, is an additional crime. \n\nYou may not like someone talking when you're on the phone, no one does. But that does not give you any right to put your hands on another person. \n\nUse your words, walk away, but do not use your hands.", "This is a generational thing. It's super rude to make or take a call when you're with someone else in person. It *is* weird to older people that everyone is so attached to their phones and in constant contact with a million people. Hell, it's weird to me, and I'm only in my 40s. Obviously, this emergency was a bit different, but it sounds like you didn't even say, \"I'm so sorry Grandma I really need to make a call\" before dialing. YTA", "Y\u2019all have no respect for your elders laying hands on an old lady.", "YTA. In general, finding a quiet room alone go chat on the phone is the polite thing to do (since phones are now portable). You are unreasonable to expect silence to preserve your phone call in a living room or kitchen. \n\nIn the cab, your option was to tell grandma, \"Oh no! Susan just called seven times and texted! I think it is an emergency. I'm going to call--she must need help!\" before dialing. \n\nI would never, ever dream of physically shutting up my grandmother that way. OMG.", "What would happen if you asked your grandmother directly \u201cwhat if I received a emergency phone call and somebody really needed my help? Do you think it is appropriate to talk over that?\u201d And then listen to her answer. Emphasize that it was a real life and death emergency. She may not have picked up on that cue. \n\nOP, would you feel it was rude if someone was visiting you and in the middle of the visit,  they initiated a conversation with someone else?  She may be feeling left out.", "Geez, ESH.\n\nUnless Grandma is going senile, she's got no reason to act like that.
