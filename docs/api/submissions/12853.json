I didn't wanna tell my daughter Ana(20) about her until I felt my relationship with Alexis was something serious and that took about 6 months to happen. The day I decided to pull Ana aside and tell her that I was seeing someone I could see her face drop. I immediately let her know that Alexis wasn't a replacement for her Mother and that she didn't have to meet her until she felt she was ready to. She told me as long I'm happy, she's happy and left it at that so I took her for her word.\n\nWell they ended up having to meet not too long after that because Alexis was going through some financial issues and was going to be evicted from her apartment, so I told her that she could live with me until she could find another place. When I told my daughter that Alexis was going to live with us temporarily because she was going through some financial woes, she told me she thinks Alexis is a gold digger and that she didn't trust her. That pissed me off because Alexis isn't that type of person. I told her I was sorry she felt that way, but that I couldn't just allow Alexis to be homeless in the streets and that if she didn't want to be in the same room as Alexis for a little while she could just move out. She stormed up to her room after that and didn't speak to me for the rest of the day. \n\nThe next day Ana told me she was moving out as I had disrespected her and her mother by having another woman move in not even a year after she had passed away. I apologized to Ana and told her I didn't mean what I had said the other day, but she told me she didn't wanna hear it and that she wasn't going to change her mind as she already let her grandparents know what was going on. Ana moved out a few days after that and Alexis moved in with me. My relationship with my daughter has suffered drastically and I haven't spoken to her for a good while.  \n\nI understand I may have been wrong because I told my daughter she didn't have to meet my girlfriend until she felt she was ready to, but at the same time because my girlfriend was being evicted and may have potentially been homeless I felt justified in allowing her to temporarily stay with me until she could find another place to live. So I'm trying to see whether I was truly wrong in breaking my promise to Ana since If not Alexis would be homeless.", "created_utc": 1679425074, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11xqk4b/aita_for_allowing_my_girlfriend_to_move_in_my/", "score": 351, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your poor daughter just lost her mom a year ago and you are already dating and already bringing in some new woman who you SAID she didn\u2019t have to meet until she was ready, but then forced her to not only MEET but LIVE WITH if she wanted to continue living in your home. Telling her she could go live elsewhere clearly tells her that you care more about the new girlfriend than her. You are NOT responsible for Alexis\u2019s living situation.

I didn't wanna tell my daughter Ana(20) about her until I felt my relationship with Alexis was something serious and that took about 6 months to happen. The day I decided to pull Ana aside and tell her that I was seeing someone I could see her face drop. I immediately let her know that Alexis wasn't a replacement for her Mother and that she didn't have to meet her until she felt she was ready to. She told me as long I'm happy, she's happy and left it at that so I took her for her word.\n\nWell they ended up having to meet not too long after that because Alexis was going through some financial issues and was going to be evicted from her apartment, so I told her that she could live with me until she could find another place. When I told my daughter that Alexis was going to live with us temporarily because she was going through some financial woes, she told me she thinks Alexis is a gold digger and that she didn't trust her. That pissed me off because Alexis isn't that type of person. I told her I was sorry she felt that way, but that I couldn't just allow Alexis to be homeless in the streets and that if she didn't want to be in the same room as Alexis for a little while she could just move out. She stormed up to her room after that and didn't speak to me for the rest of the day. \n\nThe next day Ana told me she was moving out as I had disrespected her and her mother by having another woman move in not even a year after she had passed away. I apologized to Ana and told her I didn't mean what I had said the other day, but she told me she didn't wanna hear it and that she wasn't going to change her mind as she already let her grandparents know what was going on. Ana moved out a few days after that and Alexis moved in with me. My relationship with my daughter has suffered drastically and I haven't spoken to her for a good while.  \n\nI understand I may have been wrong because I told my daughter she didn't have to meet my girlfriend until she felt she was ready to, but at the same time because my girlfriend was being evicted and may have potentially been homeless I felt justified in allowing her to temporarily stay with me until she could find another place to live. So I'm trying to see whether I was truly wrong in breaking my promise to Ana since If not Alexis would be homeless.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
