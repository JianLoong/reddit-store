I personally wouldn\u2019t leave the baby in that situation because I overthink everything and and err on the side of better safe than sorry. But, I don\u2019t think the baby was in danger.

It\u2019s incredibly unsafe to leave the child unattended in the stroller. It doesn\u2019t matter if he can \u201csee\u201d the stroller get knocked over or someone taking the baby, because he\u2019s a distance away and can\u2019t do anything about it.\n\nBeing a parent doesn\u2019t give you free reign to have *poor* \u201crisk assessments\u201d and put your child in danger. If the baby was hurt during this, I\u2019m sure it could count as criminal neglect. He needs to attend to his infant, and in no way was this him \u201cdoing his best.\u201d", "is this the husband commenting.", "So it's cool of dad lets daughter kidnapped because he was on the other side of the track when a homeless person pops out of the walking path and snags her.   \n\nJust because it's far fetched doesn't mean they don't happen in the world today.    Is it worth the risk because dad wanted to run around a track?  Maybe Dad should get a treadmill? Then he can actually watch the kid", "He doesn\u2019t get to make risk assessments like this on his own. He could have still exercised a million different ways without leaving her all alone. keeping an eye on her stroller from afar will prevent nothing. so much could go wrong and he would have no idea it was happening. She also can\u2019t yell help someone\u2019s kidnapping me! and they\u2019ll have her gone before he gets halfway back down the track. People are going to notice a baby stroller sitting all alone and he\u2019s making it way too easy for anyone that might want to grab her. there were people around everywhere. \n\nA parent making a decision does not automatically mean that it was a good parenting decision or that they\u2019re safe from all criticism because it\u2019s \u201ctheir kid\u201d. what he did was beyond stupid. I feel like you\u2019re taking this personally somehow though because you immediately went to \u201cstop nagging or he\u2019ll leave you and do it anyways when he has the kids\u201d. grow up.", "and not all high-school students and old people are good people. her point obviously wasn\u2019t that homeless people are criminals. Leaving a baby alone where homeless people sleep is still insane even if you want to accuse OP of being a homeless hater. homeless people are just people. they\u2019re capable of good and bad and you can\u2019t just assume someone\u2019s a good person. when your child is at risk, it\u2019s better safe than sorry.", "Obviously not all homeless people are criminals, but you don\u2019t need to be a criminal (or homeless) to be dangerous. But in the statistics for homeless people alone, about 38% are alcoholics while 26% are drug addicts, and addicts can be unpredictable, desperate, and therefore more dangerous. Not even necessarily due to malicious intent, a drunk person could just stumble into the stroller, someone on drugs could take the baby without even knowing *why.*\n\nBut that is ignoring all of the *other* valid reasons why leaving an infant unattended is dangerous. Sometimes babies have sudden periods of choking or being unable to breathe. An animal could attack the baby. A kid could run into the stroller. A not homeless sober person could take the baby. There are various scenarios that could harm the baby, and OP has very valid concerns for not wanting her baby to be outside in a public area unattended.", "I\u2019d be more concerned about something like this happening than someone grabbing the baby - but either way baby\u2019s safety is a valid concern here.  \n\nIf it\u2019s within reach financially, a jogging stroller could be a good solution.", "Exactly! There are so many ways a baby can hurt themself, especially when unattended in a high place on wheels, on uneven ground, with countless random variables all around. And so many could be prevented or mitigated by just having a parent within reach!", "Right? I was going to say, aren't babies specifically *not* supposed to be allowed to sleep sitting up, at least not for very long?", "You wouldn't ask around first? Try to make eye contact with any adult around and check in with them? Just straight to calling the police?", "Two things? Adjusting your life for the child you made isn't a punishment and is infact expected because babies cannot do things yet.\n\nSecondly? It is indeed a punishment when abortion access which is medical care is restricted. So I'm going to go with you jumped really hard on the fact I expect a person to consider their life choices and take care of their children. When you did not choose the kid it's a hellscape. When you did? It's your job as the parent to make those adjustments. He can still go jogging. He just needs to man up and get a handle on his schedule.", "I\u2019m American too. You don\u2019t have to explain it to me. But I\u2019m a millennial, and even I\u2019m amazed at how different childhoods are now.", "Probably not a mile-long track if it was at a school. So he was, at most, probably 150 m away from the stroller. Also, are people missing he only ran one mile? He was away for, like, 10 minutes.\n\nYTA", "Exactly! I have a friend in Norway and this would be totally normal. So if the husband is perhaps European, he may not view it as a big deal so I don\u2019t necessarily think he would be the asshole, but if he is from the US for sure he is", "Or if that\u2019s his attitude, that baby is going to die in a hot car. I just left her in the car for a minute while I ran into the store. I didn\u2019t think it would take me that long!", "Doesn\u2019t matter who buys the damn thing, but obviously he can\u2019t run with whatever stroller they do have. \n\nHopefully he doesn\u2019t leave the baby in water by themselves. That\u2019s a whole other level of dumb.", "Almost all kidnapping are by friends of the family or parents in custody battles stranger kidnappings are very rare, but as kidnapping is horrible we react with intense fear to the incredibly small chance of anything happening.", "Stranger abductions are actually very rare in the US. The vast majority of abductions are committed by family members.", "How many homeless people do you think are out there waiting to snatch a baby??", "Nothing else was mentioned by OP as being a threat but homeless people.", "Kindlymoth is dumb. Pay them no mind. Also I\u2019m so sorry you had grossly neglectful parents and their negligence led to so much trauma.  I hope you find peace and joy in every pocket of life \u2764\ufe0f", "It\u2019s so crazy to me to know that there are places that safe to be able to do that. We can all only dream of everywhere being like that. \n\nAnyway, he probably is from the US because of his AH response of not respecting her opinion/boundaries on it. And he has an over confidence in his abilities of the unknown that could take place.", "You want to find out with YOUR kid?", "OP said \u201csomeone could watch the situation and swoop in at any moment,\u201d meaning anyone, then said that there are *also* homeless people in the area. And again, it is okay to be wary of any stranger around an unattended baby, particularly someone who is inebriated and desperate, which is not the case for every homeless person but the possibility is higher.\n\nBut even if OP didn\u2019t *say* every threat or possibility, that doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t exist. All of those things could happen to an unattended infant, and that makes OP\u2019s husband an AH for leaving the baby unsupervised.", "I am okay just thought it might give them a clue if I answered. I'm good. Therapy is a tool and I used it and will if I need it again to make my life so far from what kid me could imagine kid me would think it all fictional. Happy exists and that's still wild to my brain. I am content most of the time and randomly get super excited because I am just happy and how weird that is. Trauma happens to us all and I learned we can decide if we let it define us or if we define it. That's far from simple but it does make a difference in coping", "Most places in the US are that safe too. They were that safe 50 years ago and they've only gotten safer since. The difference is people think they aren't.", "I\u2019m just saying it\u2019s unreasonable to judge the dad as being careless when this is a thing that\u2019s very unlikely to happen. Like, the risk is just so incredibly small. That\u2019s like telling parents of kids that got flesh eating bacteria that they should have never let them swim.", "Ummmm okay, well if you want to believe that \ud83e\udd23"]}
