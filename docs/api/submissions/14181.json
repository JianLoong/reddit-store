I personally wouldn\u2019t leave the baby in that situation because I overthink everything and and err on the side of better safe than sorry. But, I don\u2019t think the baby was in danger.

I read once about someone leaving their kid in the car regularly to nip into shops, the father wasn't happy so followed them one day and when mum left the kid in the car the dad went and took kid out and waited round the corner to see her reaction. I would consider something like this if he's just dismissing your feelings.", "NTA and I really hope you show your fianc\u00e9 all the replies here. I would think long and hard about if you can truly trust him after this after he didn\u2019t apologized and said he would do it again but not tell you.", "No you're not. He's an irresponsible idiot. What did you see in him?", "NAH.     He\u2019s don\u2019t done anything very dangerous, you\u2019re allowed to be worried but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that bad.     \n\nHe\u2019s a dick for saying he\u2019ll lie to you though", "NTA. A whole world of things could\u2019ve happened. Kidnapping, someone calling the cops because they see an abandoned baby and your husband getting done for child abandonment and possibly endangerment, the baby waking up and trying to get itself up to look around and getting hurt, SIDS is still a risk for a 1 year old. Has he seriously never thought to run WITH the stroller?", "NTA - this is child endangerment. You also can\u2019t trust people you don\u2019t know, just look at the [James Bulger case.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_James_Bulger)", "YTA.\n\nBut I'm not American and don't live in America.\n\nI assume there's rabid dogs and homeless people snatching sleeping babies by the bucket loads?", "YTA.  She's not in danger.", "I have a friend who works in the Irish equivalent of CPS and she says that when she\u2019s speaking with neglectful parents she tells them to think of their child as a big open sack of cash when making decisions about who they\u2019re asking to mind their child or where they\u2019re leaving them. Would you leave a big open sack of cash at the side of the track? Of course not and unfortunately, there are people for whom an unattended child is just as attractive.", "He\u2019s 100% going to leave the baby alone again so he can run and just not say anything about it from the way he said that. I\u2019d never trust him alone again.", "I'm sorry you live in a society where you have to think about these things.\n\nWhere I am from that baby would be safe. We'd help watch over the stroller to help dad and NOBODY would dream of touching that baby.\n\nThe state of some countries is just appalling. As this thread is showing.", "Agreed.\n\nSurprised I had to read so far down before seeing this comment.\n\nInstead of trying to understand your point and agree a policy together he tells you out straight I'll do something you don't like and lie to you about it.", "It just shows he\u2019s not trustworthy and cares more about his ego than his child\u2019s safety. It\u2019s really sad and I would have a hard time trusting my husband with our child any longer if he responded like this.", "Agreed, that's what makes him the AH here. The rest of it can be cultural differences. There are several western countries for which what the husband did is normal. Most people dramatically over-estimate how much anyone wants their baby.\n\nBut this lack of communication on the topic and a promise to lie in the future over something the other takes very seriously is a clear AH move. Work it out and decide what are deal-breakers and move forward as such.\n\n(NTA)", "At this point if I was OP I would enlist a trusted relative to do this and let the partner experience the terror of losing that child due to their own neglect. Partner needs a harsh reality check as he's clearly too proud and obstinate to listen to her valid concerns.", "I think the main issue everyone has with this is the fact that she's not comfortable with it and his response was that instead of coming to an agreement on how to handle it in future he told her he would just lie to her about it in future. That is so not okay. It would definitely make you question what else is he lying to her about when it comes to their child", "I'm kind of confused since he said he could see her the whole time but in my experience outdoor track don't generally have just one tree.  I've been to a couple which have trees in general and grass in the middle which people picnic on and kids play etc but those have pretty intermittent visibility and I've been to a couple more dedicated to sport where there's no trees inside the track fencing.  But this might be cultural.", "Agreed, as a dane I am flabbergasted. But then again, we are used to having our children having naptime in a baby carriage right outside with a baby monitor.\nI have seen cafes and restaurants where there are multiple right outside with kids sleeping while parents are dining inside.\nI couldn't see the issue here, as long as he could always see the stroller running around the track", "It's mental! I'm cracking up at some of the replies", "This right here. A discussion on your safety concerns should not result in one partner saying they will just lie to you. That's not good adulting, that's not a good partnership. It's not like you said you don't like when he eats onion rings, it's about another living thing, your baby!  And maybe the solution here is the other parent is the caretaker while the other workouts as it sounds like you won't agree on safety level for having baby during workouts.\n\nAlso as a note as a parent I would have flipped my lid too.", ">This is very dangerous in the US - many scenarios have been given, I'll give another :)\n\nNo, it's not. Stop lying about dangers using dumb anecdotes. Crime is down from a few decades ago and tends to be comparable to our peers (except homicides are very high). Almost all child kidnapping is custody nonsense, not psycho kidnappers stealing babies.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nParents need to keep an eye on their children, but you can do that pretty well in a relatively small, enclosed area.", "Some guys just can't back down or admit they're in the wrong. \n\nOP with a response like this I'd look into finding someone else to watch your child when you're not in. Your partner is not safe with your child. NTA", "Not to mention, what if baby gets stung by a bee or some other critter and it turns out they're allergic?\n\nThere's no way the dad would notice until after he'd finished his run and the baby was already dead.", "Best advice on reddit", "lol, why did this have to be funny", "Is a running stroller not more dangerous to the baby than sitting still?", "The guy said he had his eye on the kid the whole time, but unless the bb was parked in the center of the track, he\u2019s not being responsible. If my babysitter did this with my kid I\u2019d be pissed so why is it any different in this situation", "Haha yes true. There was a case in Denmark some years ago where a guy stole a car that had a kid in it. When he realized there was a kid there, he drove the car back.", "In Sweden too.", "Not all Europe is the same, and leaving your 1 year old alone in a public space isnt the same as leaving him or her in your balcony or your yard... I'm also from \"Europe\" and in my country this thing would be weird.", "If you don't personally murder your kids (or marry/date someone who does), their chance of being killed is reduced by over half. If you also prevent them from joining a gang, it's down to next to nothing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nChildren with good parents are safe. Hell, children with slightly bad parents are safe.", "Some, not all of course, but some homeless people are mentally ill and will absolutely try to take children. It is in the news all the time how someone tries to grab a child in front of their parents. There is a woman in England this week who tried to take a child out of his father\u2019s arms and she was screaming that it was her baby and the man stole him. And she had done this with several other children, so this is not just an American problem. And ask the British McCanns who left their three children alone in a hotel in Portugal while they had dinner. When they went to check on them, there were only two kids. Sixteen years later there is still no sign of Madeleine.", "It\u2019s pretty wild how aggressively over protective parents are here. There are definitely a few things I do with my kids that would have some of these crazies threatening to call CPS.", "American child rearing culture is bad compared to the Nordic countries. It's okay to steal good ideas from other countries.", "Couldn\u2019t that also happen at home though (baby choking on their own spit)? Or with the baby in a jogging stroller?", "It\u2019s a circular, enclosed 400m track. You leave your kid outside in your garden and it takes you longer to get to than this guy while running. He is max 200m away from the kid at all times. It takes around 2min to run one circle.", "The tree throws me though, because I wouldn't usually expect a tree inside the fencing for a football track?  I will say I'm not American but my experience with fenced in running tracks is the super dedicated athletic ones have no trees within track fencing and great visibility and the more park type ones have trees but multiple trees and not a full view of the rest of the track.", "I've heard way too many first hand accounts of people trying to walk off with kids. Like it's nuts. Several friends or partners had people try to walk off with them or their siblings in broad daylight.", "3 bees at once? Ouch. Sounds more like something a wasp would do, they\u2019re bastards", "How exactly", "He is being responsible. You\u2019re just being paranoid.\n\nEdit: to my commenter who commented and then blocked me, too late. I\u2019d suggest working on your coping skills before having any.", "Yes exactly I remember and thats literally one of the only times a kid has been taken like that here in Denmark, they don\u2019t want the kids they want the stuff", "I actually feel like older people are the ones most likely to watch TV news no? I feel like my boomer mother is way more likely to be concerned about kids getting \u201csnatched\u201d than I am or a teenager would be.", "3-5 minutes if OP is running at an absolute horrendous pace, 4 laps = 1 mile, and at an 8 minute mile pace which isn\u2019t exactly speedy Gonzales her fianc\u00e9 is running by the kid every 2 minutes.", "> 3-5 min a loop?\n\n60-80 seconds?", "I've watched toddlers get out of their strollers they arent straight jackets it can happen", "Im not gonna judge if this is n.t.a or y.t.a - I'm just super curious on how deep the \"stranger danger\" idea goes, like how often does it really happen?", "If he trips the stroller could tip over at running speed. Might even flip over a few times. Probably won't explode, so at least there's that.  lol.", "I don't know anything about your physical abilities, but I can actually turn my head and my body slightly so I can keep my eye on things behind me.", "Exactly. He is saying he will lie about how he handles the child in the future too. Red flag. \n\n My thought is you should always default to the more safety conscious/more safe idea in these types of disagreements. She's not comfortable with the risks this situation presents, he should respect that and work out how to not do it again.", "Pram tipping: why would this be an issue? Maybe if it were excessively windy?\nSuffocating: no increased risk vs taking a nap at home\nCrying: really? He\u2019s two mins away\nDog attack: it\u2019s fenced in\nFall and injury: you propose it is better if he falls WHILE pushing the baby? People run with babies all the time", "A one year old can operate the harness on a stroller? Don\u2019t think so. That\u2019s like saying they aren\u2019t safe in a car seat because they could escape. \n\nAmericans seem terrified of everything.", "Because waving your arms in front of bees is known to calm them down. lol. \n\nAlso bees can get into houses, so you can never leave a baby on it's own in your own house in case it gets stung.", "Yes interesting that the top comment was worried about him falling and getting injured while running, but that isn\u2019t a concern if he were running with the baby? Lol", "My little cousin use to manage so not sure what to tell you lol", "Not American here, and some one year olds are really active.", "To be honest you pretty much don\u2019t leave a baby on it\u2019s own. \ud83d\ude02 They are pretty demanding little gremlins.", "Oh so if i leave a baby next to a open fire it is no more dangerous then other commen situations", "And you're wrong. Leaving the baby alone in open space is definitely more dangerous than any normal situation.", "Yeah but i dont swim in a shark invested lake", "But we do. We have to sleep sometime. Being a parent is exhausting.", "Have you not heard of baby monitors?", "Holy shit. She could have been stung by a bee and died. What a terrible parent you are (apparently).", "You laugh, but she had seizures when she was a baby.\n\nIf I hadn't had eyes on her, she'd've died the first time.\n\nFucking awful shit happens, all the time and not taking simple precautions because you wanna be the cool and fun \"I'm still a person, not just a dad\" parent, and doubling down on it, well, eventually we all fuck up and our kid pays the price.\n\nI put my 1 year old in a Golden Girls style rattan kitchen chair for 2 seconds while I put the milk away.\n\nShe fell heading toward the tile floor.\n\nShe bounced off a pack of Pampers.\n\nI knew she couldn't sit well (see aforementioned seizures causing brain damage), but I thought it would be okay cause I was right there.\n\nKids are actively trying to destroy themselves from the moment they gain independent movement."]}
