Most 5 point harness style strollers *should* be safe to sleep in for short duration IF the baby is properly strapped in, on a hard flat surface, and not surrounded by anything that poses a suffocation risk\u2026 and even then they shouldn\u2019t be left unsupervised (which I would call this situation) and should be monitored at least for movement/breathing sounds by a monitor if you can\u2019t see/hear your baby because you are too far away. \n\nSome cultures have successful/non lethal traditions of letting babies sleep somewhat unsupervised in crib like strollers\u2026 but those are *babies* who can\u2019t crawl out, and frankly the unsupervised babies are visible and somewhat supervised because the the cultural tradition means many people are looking at the baby as they pass it\u2026 still, that might mean you only find out your baby is in trig or because someone saw their blue face, and that\u2019s fucking risky IMO. So while it may be seen as fine, it requires specific equipment and still caries risk, which means one parent vetoing it as unsafe is enough to end it in my book. Kind of like co sleeping - it can be done safer, and often is done in non western countries, but they do it on harder, flatter beds with less bedding material to suffocate babies and adults in those countries historically have much lower BMIs/are smaller and have statistically shown a lower risk of crushing or suffocating the baby from rolling over\u2026 but not zero risk, like putting the baby in a crib would provide.", "It's also weird that he assumes he only has to worry about other adults, and that high schoolers are inherently trustworthy somehow. As if no person who abuses children or is violent ever acted that way in their teens, only sprung fully-formed into sociopathy once they were of age.", "I remember the case about that Danish lady in a cafe in New York that got arrested for child abandonment for doing this with her baby lol.", "In the US, there is a good chance harm will come to an unattended child.", "At the very least, even if he didn\u2019t understand why he shouldn\u2019t leave the baby alone, he should\u2019ve agreed to never do it again when OP told him her concerns. The fact that he intends to lie about it is extremely concerning.", "Please just get divorced if you\u2019re ever seriously considering staging a fake kidnapping of your infant to get back at your partner", "Look what happened to Maddie. Sometimes the Luck runs away. Nowdays caution us mandatory", "Yeah that comment was so elitist. What is a homeless person going to do with your baby ma'am?", "Yeah, I'm American too, but I think our country if full of helicopter parents. Which is crazy to me because I'm a millennial and a lot of the parents are as well.  Do they not remember how we were raised? We were kicked out of the house at like 8 a.m. and told to come back for dinner.  Where did our generation learn that you need to watch a child every second of every day?  I realize we're taking about a 1-year old here, but a baby can nap in a stroller for 20 minutes while a parent runs around the fenced-in track.", "It's not impossible someone grabs her out of her room that night. Going to stay up watching her all the time?", "Every day in the US a child is abducted by a stranger and, of those who are, only 43% ever return home. That means that approximately 12570 children in the US have been abducted by a stranger since Jamie Bulger's death, and 5403 of them never made it back home. And that's the risk for all parents, that risk is much higher for children left unattended by incompetent parents.\n\n[https://safeatlast.co/blog/child-abduction-statistics/#gref](https://safeatlast.co/blog/child-abduction-statistics/#gref)\n\nFor reference, that means it's less than 3x as likely that they'll die in a car crash than be abducted by a stranger (this doesn't include an abduction by someone who knows the child and plans to abduct them). But if a parent said they weren't going to make their kid wear a seatbelt or was driving like a maniac with children in their car then they'd be roundly condemned.\n\nhttps://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/813285\n\nThe reason the Jamie Bulger came to my mind is:\n\n\\- The mention in the OP of the husband assuming the baby is safe because the people around are children.\n\n\\- The mention that he's looking at the baby or the surrounding area the whole time, just like Jamie Bulger's mother was.\n\n\\- My brother is called Jamie and is the same age as Jamie Bulger so it has a personal twang to me.\n\n\\- I live in the UK, where child abduction by strangers is much rarer - it's 7x more likely to happen in the US.\n\n\\- It's a particularly chilling and high-profile case.\n\nIt did not come to mind because it happens so rarely that a 30 year old case is all I can muster up.", "For starters, you have disturbed people who want babies to pass off as their own. This is common enough for hospitals to have a standard \"code pink\" in maternity wards when a baby goes missing.\n\nYou also have the ones who will pretend to support heavily pregnant mothers, often with donations of baby food, diapers, and accessories to lure the mother into thinking they are safe. Then the psycho kills the mother (and usually the baby unintentionally) by cutting them out of the womb. There have been several well circulated cases in the US media.\n\nOn the other hand, you have the pedophiles who are fine with stealing a child in their \"preferred range\" to abuse and later dump.\n\nYou don't have to believe this is prevalent enough or has to be X% of the population to be a problem for you. All you need is one person nearby to turn complacency into tragedy.", "[deleted]", "My mom had a rulle: don't leave a baby where you wouldn't leave a million dollars.", "Look, the amount of people that actually want to abduct a toddler is very very small", "This is not true. In the US, very, very few unattended children are abducted by strangers. Statistically, there is a good chance nothing will happen to them. The problem in the US is we want to guarantee safety.

Much happier than  the thief dropping the kid off in a public area. Or thief dumping the car with the kid in it, leaving the kid to die of exposure if they aren't found.\n\nAnd sometimes the parent comes out, tries to grab their child from the car, and either the parent or child or both are dragged to death by the thief driving away.", "Honestly, is both resources and the crapshoot of what cops and what CPS show up. \n\nIn my county of residence, we have only 70percent of the staff we should have. Some counties have less than half", "Yes, and one day the toddler is fine sitting in the stroller,  next week he has learned how to squeeze out from under the restraints and climb out.  It took my daughter a week and a half to go from standing in the crib yelling for me and climbing out.", "Same.  His attitude would cause me to completely lose all trust in his judgment, and therefore I would know that the relationship is over.  If I cannot trust my partner, no way am I sticking around to have my trust abused again - 1000 times more because my child is involved.  OP, hope you are reading the red flags and will act accordingly.", "And if something happened he wouldn\u2019t have to run the full circle of the track, he could cut across to get to baby.", "Yep.  Jogging with a stroller you can get hit by a car (I know there were people who didn't see me at intersections, because I SAW them give that 'start' when they finally looked in the right place and noticed me and the stroller or tumble out if you go down a hill wrong or hit a weird bump.  That's never happened to me but after marathon training with a jogging stroller, there is no question in my mind that it's riskier than the baby sitting in a stationary stroller.", "Same. I can't believe how so many people think that apparently the parent is running miles away from this child and just leaving them. I thought I was going crazy. \n\nA standard track is 1/4 mile. You're going to pass the baby every 2-4 minutes if you're running. As long as you're making a point to peep in as you go by, you're not leaving the baby any longer than you would if you went to the bathroom without them. As long as the baby is appropriately strapped in, I don't see a huge risk here. And I say that as a parent who falls closer to the helicopter end of things than free-range. I've taken my kid to a track at a school and let her prance around and play while I ran. There aren't homeless waiting to snatch kids up, worst thing that happened was the sprinklers came on and she got wet (which she LOVED).", "While cutting grass some time ago I felt a burning pain in my arm.
