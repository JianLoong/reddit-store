I told them what happened and why I wouldn't let them in our pool and they complied, but my wife's other family members didn't. The next day, I have texts from random contacts about how assholish I am for purposefully excluding them from the pool (no one was in it) and how I should make amends.

NO.", "It totally makes sense why you didn't want the kiddos in the pool if they're not potty-trained yet. Nobody wants any \"accidents\" in their pool. \n\nBut maybe next time, just give the parents a heads up in advance or find a fun way to distract the kids so they don't feel left out.

Just close down the pool.", "The chlorine would kill any germs. There was zero chance of people catching something. There is the ick factor - totally reasonable.

No one was even in the pool. That means there was no one to watch them. That means you had two very good reasons to keep them out of the pool.  Not being potty trained is a big deal. Those swim diapers don't really hold anything but the big chunks. You would have to disinfect the entire pool just to be safe if they got in it.", "INFO - Did the parents bring swim diapers?", "The bigger issue appears to be that they wanted to swim in your pool without a parent there to watch them.

Did you just move into the house and this was their first time visiting?  Had you discussed pool rules ahead of time with the parents? \n\nIt\u2019s totally fine that you don\u2019t want little kids in your pool. However, you should have made the pool rules clear to the parents before anyone came over. That way the kids would have had it explained to them multiple times in advance that they wouldn\u2019t be able to swim in the pool. If the first time you explained the rules was directly to the children after they had said they wanted to go in it, then YTA. You waited way too long to let them know.", "Sounds like this was a normal gathering not a pool party.

If you're worried about the kids pissing in the pool, I have news for you about the behavior of a lot of older children and adults.\n\nBabies go in swimming pools all the time. It's not the babies that cause the unexpected pool closures - it's the toddlers whose parents are convinced that they are potty trained, but they still have frequent accidents.\n\nWhether you're the AH or not depends on whether the parents had swim diapers for the kids, or they were proposing to send them in your pool bare-assed.", "Before going any farther.

They're all cleaning their ass, washing their hands. I think the adults might be worse?", "NTA in my opinion.  Tell them to put Non-disposable swim diapers which are specially designed to be used in swimming pools. Most public pools require any child not potty trained to wear a swim diaper. Then they can get in the pool. If they defecated in your pool you will have to clean it up.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

And toddlers aren\u2019t very likely to poop while they\u2019re swimming around in a pool anyway. Now if you go see them silently squatting somewhere, that\u2019s when they\u2019re likely pooping. Do you poop while you\u2019re actively moving around? Infants on the other hand are very likely to poop in pools because it\u2019s relaxing. Also, many adults don\u2019t wipe their butts very well so there are poo particles floating around it every pool you get in whether or not kids have been allowed in it.
