A said something along the lines of \u201cthe wife wanted tickets\u201d (I don\u2019t actually remember the topic because it was off-hand and the ensuing discussion derailed the conversation). F did not like how A referred to his wife as \u201cTHE wife\u201d and explained how it was impersonal to the actual human being and was referring to her as a categorical role like \u201cthe butler\u201d, with the preference to use \u201cmy wife\u201d instead. Everyone else (4 guys) kind of balked at the comment, which upset her more. A slightly heated discussion followed where we tried to explain why it wasn\u2019t a big deal to us: \n\n\n- everyone there had met her and knows her, so it\u2019s not like we weren\u2019t aware of who she was\n- A said that even his wife wouldn\u2019t mind\n- such a literal interpretation of \u201cthe wife\u201d could mean \u201cmy wife\u201d conveys ownership or possession\n- the term wife is a term of endearment and personal by definition, as opposed to \u201cball and chain\u201d or \u201cthe old lady\u201d\n-using \u201cmy butler\u201d is no better than \u201cthe butler\u201d\n\nWhen it started to go off the rails is when she responded by saying \u201cyou are being fucks\u201d multiple times in the back and forth (only swear words used in the whole conversation).\n\nI pointed out that her calling us fucks is worse than her being offended for someone who isn\u2019t there and wouldn\u2019t be offended if she were there. I also said her opinion of \u201cthe wife\u201d as an offensive/impersonal term is her interpretation of the word \u201cwife\u201d on its own not being a positive thing in the first place.\n\nI have a personal bias against people who get offended on behalf of others, so I think I have blindside here. Am I the AH?\n\nI plan of apologizing tomorrow just to smooth things over, so this is mostly just for my peace of mind.\n\nEdit: Just to explain a bit more about the progression of the conversation:\n\nF says she doesn\u2019t like A using \u201cthe wife\u201d term, A explains in his relationship it isn\u2019t derogatory. F rejects this and explains a bit, then the conversation topic opens to the rest of the group. We each agree with A and elaborate a bit. F rejects this and elaborates.

The way she said was just so\u2026\u2026 you know\u2026\u2026. fucky?????", ">where we tried to explain why it wasn\u2019t a big deal to us\n\nGood rule of thumb in life: if some type of terminology isn't a big deal to you but it *is* a big deal to your companion, you should defer to their wishes, at least for the duration of the conversation. \n\nThe English language has bountiful ways to express the same ideas. Therefore insisting on using the specific terminology someone finds offensive is inherently AH-ish. The only exception would be if there is an important reason (either objective or personally significant) to use that particular vocabulary\n\nBut it's also AH-ish to correct someone else's word choice in a social situation unless they are repeatedly using it and/or it is objectively offensive.\n\nIn this case, her objection was not based on objective criteria since the term in question is a commonly used colloquialism, often used as a term of endearment. So the only way to have politely brought up her concerns would have been to claim it was a pet peeve or a quirk\n\nSo, ESH", "ESH.\n\n\"F\" sounds insufferable, but she's right.

It\u2019s a bit obnoxious and there\u2019s no reason not to say \u2018my wife\u2019 or \u2018name\u2019. Plus it\u2019s telling that the only woman at the table told you it\u2019s a bit gross and only the men said it was fine. Men generally aren\u2019t the experts on how women like to be referred to.\n\nThat said, don\u2019t think it needs to be a whole big thing and it was a bit OTT to call you all fucks.\n\nSide note, I can tolerate \u2018the wife\u2019 but I fucking hate \u2018the missus\u2019.", "ESH\n\nShe's not entirely wrong that it comes across as a bit demeaning---kind of gives vibes of Boomer jokes---but it's also such a ridiculously small thing, not worth turning into a fight.", "I have to say ESH. I've never heard a woman say \"the husband\" in any context. She overdid it with the name-calling, but I understand her frustration. \"The wife\" is objectifying, whether it's meant to be or not.", "YTA - it's pretty common that calling someone \"my wife\" and \"the wife\" isn't the same. You guys took it personal and were trying to prove \"you're not sexist\". She didn't call you sexist, get over it.\nAnd YTA for not seeing the irony of your own \"hate when people get offended on behalf of others\" when it is exactly what you did x) Your friend was the one being \"corrected\", not you, not the other guys. Still you went on a 4 vs 1 argument for something concerning your very present friend. And really it wasn't about her getting offended for this woman but sharing how it's not a good way to talk about a woman in general. \n\nNow if you really want a basic explanation on why \"my\" is better than \"the\" (even though it's so basic I get why she called you fucks instead of participating to a debate full of irrelevant counterpoints) : \"the wife\" refers to the person focusing on their role while \"my wife\" focus on the bond they share. Thus \"the wife\" is impersonal and can easily be seen as degrading as someone having a function more then a connection.", "YTA. Most women hate this. My wife abhors it. It harkens back to the not so long ago times when women were chattel and only had the amount of recognition as human beings that the men in their lives allowed hem. I highly recommend losing it from your vocabulary.", "ESH - The wife sounds very impersonal, but if she is okay with it, then it's fine.", "YTA. The Wife is disrespectful and diminishing. Why get married if you hate your spouse?", "There\u2019s a joke in there somewhere about saying you\u2019re *my* asshole instead of *the* asshole but I don\u2019t feel like I know you well enough to be the one to make that joke  - so you\u2019ll have to settle for being the asshole.

I had to search for it a bit (didn\u2019t know what to T was called off the top of my head): social linguistics. I attached one example of research about various ways husbands addressed their wives in various settings and the social meanings. Power and intimacy were two the function/social meaning possibilities. Kind of resembles the two social meanings interpreted at the table. \n\nWith this study in mind, both viewpoints were valid in this situation.

I've never heard of \"the wife\" being used as anything other than affectionately, and I've definitely heard \"the husband\" being thrown around a time or two.", "NTA it really depends on the couple I think. I've met couples where the woman will refer to her husband as \"husband\" when he isn't there and he will in turn refer to her as \"the wife\". Like it might sound impersonal to you, but if they are okay with it, then it's nobody's business. I get why she finds it offensive, but if he thinks his wife would be okay with it(and he would have a better idea of that), then it really doesn't matter if your dad's girlfriend thinks it's okay.", "NTA because like you, I can't stand someone being offended for someone else. I'd ask \"the wife\" if she minds, but I bet she won't. I wouldn't apologise, honestly. It's nice you want to smooth things over but she will only carry on doing stuff like that if you do!", "NTA \n\nShe is the one who started getting personal, and it wasn't even HER who was \"being insulted\".  I hope your dad has a high tolerance for drama.", "ESH\n\n\nShe shouldn't have called you all fcks to make her point.\n\nYou guys use of the word is degrading in general. It was also acceptable to refer to her as your b$#tch..... But that was socially deemed inappropriate and dropped. Just because you still say it and she allegedly allows it... doesn't make it OK to the world at large. That's probably more to the point of what she was trying to convey to everyone at the table. And of course all the men dismissed her claims because you know better....than what a woman would feel like in a situation like this...\n\n\nI suggest an actual apology is in place. She was actively looking out for the well being of your wife.\n\nI'm also guessing this Convo involved multiple drinks.

Your friend is a misogynist, and at the very least, i.e. if you're not one yourself, you're enabling him. If this terminology isn't a big deal to you but obviously is a big deal to your partner, enough for her to bring it up, you should think a bit more before ganging up on her with your friends. Really Sh\\*tty of you to do that.", "No you are not.   \n\n\nSigned the wife of 44 years.", "From someone who gets called 'the wife' occasionally by her husband, when he first did it, I thought it sounded degrading but I noticed a difference in 'the wife' and my wife when he spoke the words. 'The wife' he always got a sparkle in his eye and a slight smile on his face as if he was glad that 'the wife' was me. It felt like he was saying 'the one for me'. I soon found I enjoyed hearing it. I think it all depends on who says it, the tone they use and if the person it said about is accepting of it. 'The wife' is no longer used as a term of ownership but as a term of endearment.", "ESH, because how could such a petty argument rule the dinner table so easily? Just apologize and move on. There\u2019s almost no reason to ever engage in petty arguments. I will say that F is probably the biggest AH here for starting the argument amongst people she isn\u2019t as familiar with. All that aside, I think it is an interesting debate to have, just not when anyone involved is offended. And yes it\u2019s super annoying when people get offended on behalf of others, ESPECIALLY when you know the subject of the conversation wouldn\u2019t be offended themselves.", "Is F quite a bit younger than your dad ?", "NTA\u2026maybe idk\n\nI\u2019d say n a h if she didn\u2019t call you guys fs \n\nBecause the wife while meant in endearment in your circle - is also meant as a sarcastic dismissive tone. Where some people are being playfully sarcastic, many times historically it was actually a term that outlines the \u2018old lady\u2019 trope (the idea there\u2019s a nagging wife, the wife, the ball and chain etc.). I\u2019d argue that she is objectively right - she doesn\u2019t t know the wife, you\u2019re in mixed company and therefore maybe save the terms that are casual/can be misconstrued for your private inner circle. If he\u2019s referring to her generally (like at work) we usually say my partner/wife/husband to denote their role in our life (not possession, that\u2019s you trying to be literal grammatically just to argue).\n\nI am female, a black expat, trust me I have my share of friends who I know deeply and can use terms like this across many lines. I have grown up and learned those terms are rooted in racism/mysoginy etc. and know better than to use it publicly. Not because my friends or I, but because I may be cementing/propagating a negative stereotype by accident when there are others there. \u2018The wife\u2019 is not objectively polite or proper way to refer to his wife. \n\nTo you her swearing was an example of inappropriate, but in reality the impact of the messages matters more to me -  \u2018the wife\u2019 is much more deeply rooted in hurtful meaning than a word like f which is as empty in meaning as it is \u2018loaded\u2019 according to social norm. That said, I wouldn\u2019t swear freely either (I can swear like a sailor) just anywhere.\n\nImho get with the times and acknowledge there are many terms that are loaded on much deeper and hurtful levels that we as a society have uncovered over time. Swear words are not where it stops, and honestly the use of swear words amongst grown ups is arguable. Imho I don\u2019t swear at people, but will use swear words as expressive tools in certain situations.\n\nTLDR/ there\u2019s a time and place. You were either both sucky or not for arguing. You could\u2019ve simply told her the wife\u2019s name and acknowledged that her and your father do not know her - therefore it would be demeaning to refer to the wife that way TO THEM. She is objectively correct.", "I say \u201cmy old lady\u201d .. were 26 lol people are so fuckin offended these days i don\u2019t understand", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

And it's not a positive, equal, team image.\n\nTo help put this in perspective... Your example of \"my baby brother\" implies two main things: you have an affectionate relationship with your sibling, and you're an older sibling. It CAN be used in an infantilizing sense but it's almost universally used affectionately. Now let's contrast that to \"the wife.\" It is immediately impersonal (not \"my\" wife, but a removed \"the\") and it is almost exclusively used in contexts where (as I mentioned) \"the wife\" needs to be consulted because you don't have freedom to do things without consulting her. Like \"the boss.\" Even if it's said with affection the base words are the furthest thing from affectionate as opposed to \"baby brother.\"\n\nIt's less English lit and more... English lol.
