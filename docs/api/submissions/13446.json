Does she contribute to your wellbeing (by making meals, driving you places, supporting your interests)?

It\u2019s pushy of her to be dropping hints about what you should buy her for a day celebrating your mom when she did not give birth to you and/or raise you. Tell your dad that you\u2019ll do your best to be respectful of her as his wife and as a *adult female figure* in your life, but that he needs to have a talk with her about your boundaries as far as not calling you her son (she can say stepson because that is true!).\n\nMy stepparents never ever overstepped or tried to act like my parents - they simply acted like \u201cadditional adults available to support me\u201d.

I still (after 20 years of knowing both my step-dad and step-mom) do NOT call them dad/mom and don\u2019t buy them fathers/Mother\u2019s Day gifts. The past few years I do *text* them on those days saying thank you for being a good role model in my life - but that\u2019s something I do because at this point we are quite close.

I think that's very offensive.", "Perhaps you missed where he _did_ have a conversation with her when she married his father.  He made it very clear that she was his father's wife, but not a mother figure to him.  He's repeatedly asked her not to refer to him as \"her son\" and has corrected her when she does it in front of him.  She has shown no consideration for his feelings or his boundaries.  Yes, he lashed out.  But she's been disrespecting him for a full year.  She's the one that needs to be an adult, apologize for not listening when he expressed his need for her to _not_ act like a parental figure or claim him as \"her son\", and offer to work on a different kind of relationship structure.

My brothers even pushed away aunts and uncles. They are trying to establish themselves. \n\nThe stepmother is disrespecting OP. She is ignoring every sign that teenage boys don't want mothering by anyone. They barely tolerate their own mothers. In his eyes, she would be the same as household help. So every house that has a staff, they should be treated as parents? No. She would do all those things if OP wasn't there. And it sounds like he doesn't stay at his dad's very much.

That's what this is all about.", "Exactly! No one can be forced into loving a step-parent, especially to a teenager. \n\nIt would be different if the step-parent was always in the child's life (like from birth) since that person is the only parent that kid knows.

Of course, this isn't the case for the OP and tons of other kids.", "The very least, both parties need to respect each other and be civil. It would be ideal if everyone got along, but that's not the case for everyone. \n\nIt's nice when a step-parent tries to bond with the step-kids, but they would be pushing major boundaries when they act like they need to be seen as a parent (on the same level as the birth parents, especially if they are in the kid's life still).", "I'm sure Op takes the motherly benefits of her cooking for him. Washing his clothes, giving him rides if needed. I'm not saying he should view her as a mom because she's not, but she is still an adult and he was disrespectful.

But if roles were reverse and if step mom/dad behaved the way you behaved towards step child,  they'd be committing biggest sin on the earth and people will be ready with pitchforks to burn them alive.  \n\nWhat I'm trying to say is, decency goes both ways. Yes, you don't want mother son relationship,  and it's okay.

OP's step-mom is pushing his boundaries because she wants to be closer than they are. She's not wrong to want that but neither is he for not being on the same page. What a \"good\" relationship looks like is subjective in general but especially in blended families. Some people aim to merely be cordial and others want to genuinely bond. As sucky as it is, OP doesn't want to be very close at this point in time and that's not inherently wrong. What's likely annoying him more and creating the desire to escalate is the constant pushing instead of stepping back and following his pace.", "Right, but I just hope that this isn't/won't be just one of the many instances that OP treats his stepmother like that.
