Does she contribute to your wellbeing (by making meals, driving you places, supporting your interests)?

It\u2019s pushy of her to be dropping hints about what you should buy her for a day celebrating your mom when she did not give birth to you and/or raise you. Tell your dad that you\u2019ll do your best to be respectful of her as his wife and as a *adult female figure* in your life, but that he needs to have a talk with her about your boundaries as far as not calling you her son (she can say stepson because that is true!).\n\nMy stepparents never ever overstepped or tried to act like my parents - they simply acted like \u201cadditional adults available to support me\u201d.

I\u2019d suggest not making her a foe as it\u2019ll hurt your relationship with your dad. \n\nI suggest asking for family counselling. Hash out what you want her to call you. I know you don\u2019t want her calling you her son. Stepson? Husband\u2019s son. Your name? Hash out what you\u2019ll call her. \n\nI suggest apologies are in order. She for not respecting your preferences and you for being harsh. \n\nLet your Dad know Step Mother\u2019s Day is the Sunday after Mother\u2019s Day. Maybe you can all go out for brunch or something.

I say this as a stepmom to a really fantastic kid, we came into each other's lives when he was 5 and our bond formed pretty fiercely over the years. His biomom is abusive and absent for the most part for the majority of his life, and it made sense that since his dad and I were raising him together full time he would identify with me as a mother figure.

I hope it doesn't happen, but if it does the only way I feel I can respond is to respect him and his feelings and enforce what I've always told him. Aside from requiring basic respect for me as an adult authority figure, I can't force him to love me or see me as his mom. I'm expecting these things because hormones are wild and he has always struggled with the bad choices his biomom has made, there's definitely potential for him to push back at me out of anger towards her. But even though I've loved him, raised him, supported him, been the only real mom he's ever known, he's not obligated in any way to return those things. \n\nNot shitting on your pov, I just don't think it should ever be a given for kids to love the people raising them.

I know he didn't get a choice at all in who became his stepmom, but if he loves his dad, and stepmom is generally good to him I think it's rude to be cold towards her for no reason. \"I don't want another mom\" isn't a reason, because she doesn't need to be his mom for him to be nice to her. \n\nI don't think it's wrong for her to consider him her son either, if she's been maternal towards him for some period between 1-4 years. If she cooks and cleans up after him, and shares a home with him, in my view that's enough to consider yourself someone's parent (specifically in your own eyes).

Super nice, still shouldn't call him son if the \"son\" doesnt want it. \n\nThe mother of his best friend where he spends a whole lot of time and saw them grow up? Adorable! She still can't call him \"son\" if he does not want it. \n\nYou can love someone \"like a son\", it doesn't make them your son.", ">But she just \"hinted\" as OP called it, about gift ideas she'd like, and that doesn't make her asshole.\n\nShe can expect that present. But to make those expectations known to the guy who has been rejection her \"moderhood\" over him, that AH all the way around. \n\n>And since when calling a child of your husband Son became \"stomping boundaries\" ?\n\nSince forever. Catch up.", "It sounds like you are consistently unkind to her. You don\u2019t have to bond with someone to treat them with kindness and grace.", "In the kindest way possible, it doesn\u2019t sound like it. The way you wrote about this woman\u2026. It\u2019s obvious you don\u2019t like her. \n\nIt may work in favour of your boundaries if you act a little kinder towards her. Treat her as a friend or colleague, and she may stop pushing for a \u2018closer bond\u2019.\n\nMy mother-in-law really tried to push our relationship in the run up to my wedding. It made me uncomfortable. What I did was provide small, but friendly compromises. Little actions that showed I cared. Asking her to come to the cake tasting, for example.\n\nIt established that cared about her feelings, which is all she really wanted to know. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re very kind to your dad\u2019s wife. You don\u2019t have to see her as a mother or as family to treat her with kindness.", "Weeeeelllllll. Some of your self quotes didn\u2019t really sound like they fit into the parameters required to maintain a polite relationship. I say this as like recognizing like, as I (in my teen years) also attempted to lead a parental figure swiftly and directly out the front door. \n\nIt is really up to your dad to manage her expectations regarding your relationship with her, so no need to be generous and inform her she isn\u2019t getting a Mother\u2019s Day gift. Let your dad explain. You do need to have a conversation with your dad about his expectations of you with regard to stepmom, and it may be best to have this conversation in a therapeutic setting or in the presence of an unbiased family member who can act as a mediator. Have you had a one-on-one conversation with your dad about stepmom?", "Basic politeness is a thing that exists for a reason. I do not think it\u2019s an unreasonable ask from his dad that he displays basic politeness towards his dad\u2019s wife and vice versa.

That he\u2019ll treat her as his father\u2019s wife but not as a mom. \n\nHe\u2019s treated her civilly but she continually disrespected his boundary by calling him her son, he isn\u2019t her son. That\u2019s a boundary breaker. \n\nHe\u2019s NTA, the wife and dad are", "Relationship takes two sides. It\u2019s fine to not acknowledge her as a mom or even stepmom, but is it okay to treat someone cares for him everyday like they are just a stranger to him after 4 years? Without any more info (like the stepmom caused the divorce or actually mistreating him etc), I think OP is being slightly disrespectful. \n\nThere is no way for them to not having any kind of relationship if he is living at his dad\u2019s place for the most part while the step mom is taking care of him and his dad. This is why he needs to think about it and talk about it with his parents. If he truly doesn\u2019t want any kind of relationship then he probably should live with his mom but I wonder what happens if his mom remarries.", "This sub again and the \u201cyou\u2019re not obligated\u201d stuff, part of being human is sometimes doing things you aren\u2019t obligated to but you know it would make someone happy. Does op like his dad at all? Wouldn\u2019t he want to make his father happy by trying to get along with his wife whom he loves?", "That\u2019s just not true. The harsh truth is much sadder. I should\u2019ve been kinder when I was younger because the people my parents ended up with are only doing their best in a confusing situation while trying to love the most important people in the world to me. The harsh truth is anything I did to make that complicated or difficult was selfish and foolish because I wish them the utmost success in loving my parents and accepting me for all I am. I am grateful my parents are not alone in their separate lives, I am grateful to have even more people to love me now, and I am regretful for having learned that a bit late.", "Or maybe it just \\*gasp\\* *doesn't happen.*", "I'm not your son. I'm not getting you anything for Mother's Day. Stop calling me your son. These are direct things that needed to be said in this situation, and your second paragraph is wishy washy and vague. He didn't say anything more than was polite to a pushy person, and she was hurt because her expectations were deeply not met. \"Talk to someone else about the situation,\" and \"everyone goes to therapy\" are not actionable advice for this immediate interaction. Extra shitty that you are responding to the kid directly and trying to lecture them, instead of participating in the generalized discussion, advice, and voting. \n\nYes, OP, talk to your dad about how he and she both expect you to act vs how you are willing to act. Also talk to your step-mom about this. As you did.", "How about she abides by OP\u2019s boundaries thus avoiding this situation altogether? OP has stated that he is polite.
