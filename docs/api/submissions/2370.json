Gotta say I'd love for someone to make me dinner and there's nothing wrong with Mac & Cheese, especially with steak. If she didn't want what was being made, she was welcome to not eat it. She could've had steak. What an entitled, immature, ungrateful, and rude beotch. Insane to me to go to someone else's house that's kind enough to prepare a meal, then insult it. Audacity to then DEMAND their host pay for an expensive alternate meal!!! You're NTA be she definitely IS.", "Nta she sounds racist af too.

Also \u2018white people Mac and cheese\u2019 sounds so offensive", "NTA. Is this the first time seeing this side of her? Might be a red flag to keep an eye on", "NTA. You were making her food and she didn't appreciate it. Then she expected you to buy her something else. She's an adult and can feed herself. She sounds entitled and bratty.", "info: i'm just curious here but what are your races?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

People are weird and you are not at fault here.", "NTA. Sounds like a nice dinner to me. White people Mac and cheese? Tell her to make the better kind, then.", "NTA\n\nSo you were to still make her a portion so that Che would complain and insult you more? Then because her actions had consequences you were supposed to let her use your phone to pay for her dinner? Goodness she sounds exhausting. \n\nIf someone told me that what I was going to make looks \u201cnasty\u201d and \u201cflavorless\u201d I would assume that they didn\u2019t want any either. I would also tell them they could leave then and we\u2019ll catch up later.

I'm curious now lol", "ESH - she insulted what you were going to make, so you had a right to be upset.  Instead of communicating how you felt, you did something petty.", "INFO: Why are you dating such an unpleasant woman? You don't OWE her a meal, particularly after she insulted you over it. \n\nNTA but if this is a pattern, you need to make a decision", "NTA.

Maybe the way SHE makes mac and cheese is bland. I love homemade mac and cheese. Monterey Jack cheese with jalapeno peppers is the bomb. The actual entitlement of some people. Hope your single now.... Much better woman out there for you than her. Find a woman who appreciates the little things.", "Mac and Cheese is never tastless she had to be joking or on drugs", "If you don't properly salt your pasta,  it will just suck the flavor out of your cheese sauce.  Especially as it cools down."]}
