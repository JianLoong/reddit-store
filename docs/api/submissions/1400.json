Been apart now for about 3. I've stayed in distant contact with friends of hers, and her daughter (18F now) through social media. We have a child together (6M). Our child loves his big sister, and I still look at her as one of my own, since we were there for of her growing years. She keeps in loose contact with me. We tell each other \"I love you\", etc when we see each other.\n\nMoat importantly, I was there when her Bio-father died of cancer. Very aggressive. Found out when he had a seizure, and died about 6 months later, just before her 13th birthday. Her mother and him were a one-night stand, and we had been together by this point for a couple of years.\n\nA lot of her fathers friends have been there for her through the grieving process, and I kept my mouth shut for the most part. I'm the side-piece. I didn't know the guy very well at all. Not my business unless it needs to be, and I would be there for her. That kind of thing. But I did keep my eyes open.\n\nFor the most part he was a decent enough bloke. VERY devoted to his daughter when he could be. Spoiled her rotten lol\n\nAs a person, not so much. Still lived with his Mum because he couldn't stand on his own. Had a shite job because he had no ambition to do better. Drank like a fish, and partied all the time.\n\nHis daughter was absolutely destroyed when he died, because he gave her everything he had without question.\n\nEven still years after, she has gone through serious therapy, and is still struggling with his death. I see posts from some of his friends on social media that \"kind of\" glorify the party lifestyle he had. Hell, at his own funeral, one of his friends told a story about how he would get trashed, and steal from the house party he was at if he though they were \"too well off\". And everyone laughed because \"oh yeah, that sounds like him\". Except me. I didn't think that was very funny.\n\nSo recently, another post came across where one of her Dad's friends compared him to a rockstar. I messaged them on the side and told them they don't need to be glorifying her dad that way. She's still struggling and this is part of the reason why. Everyone keeps telling her how great her dad was, when in reality, he really wasn't. \n\nI haven't told her about the convo. And myself and the person are actually having a good chat about it right now, and they sees my POV. They just misses their friend, which I get. Completely.\n\nAm I the AH for even bringing it up? Should I have kept my mouth shut?", "created_utc": 1667609791, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ymfsp5/aita_i_called_out_a_friend_of_my_stepdaughters/", "score": 1, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
