Do you hear yourself?", "NTA - imagine using your kid for Insta clicks and making her suffer with old ill-fitting shoes just so you can make a IG video no one really cares about anyway. You are NTA, but your wife sure is.", "NTA for not waiting until your wife gets back. YTA for letting your daughter get bruised before she gets new cleats.", "Jesus Christ NTA, using your kids for IG clout is shitty enough, making them suffer to do it is even worse. Good job letting her wear the cleats, you should talk to your wife about using your daughter for social media points....", "NTA. Your kid\u2019s soccer cleats exist *so she can play soccer.*  They do not exist for the purposes of an unboxing video. Does your wife realise she\u2019s sending the message to your daughter that social media is more important than her child?", "Putting your needs, and especially just your wants, ahead of your child\u2019s well-being is always a loser move. No offense, but your wife sounds very selfish. NTA and please continue to do right by your daughter. I get the sense she needs someone in her corner.", "WTF, the kid's cleats don't fit and mom wants to wait to video it?  Man, I'm glad I'm older and didn't worry about this stuff when my kids were little.  She needs her new shoes now, don't mess up her feet.  You are NTA.", "It's a health and safety issue.\n\nLet her wear the cleats.\n\nNTA.\n\nYour wife is being an asshole for insisting she wait.", "Oh hellllllll no!!!\n\nNTA and you would be a seriously spineless AH if you make your daughter wear tight shoes because your wife thinks anyone gives a shit about a dumbass unboxing video\n\nPathetic. You should make an unboxing video of your daughters messed up toes coming out that baby cleat and send it to her", "NTA. Instagram isn't nearly as important as cleats that fit.", "Are you kidding. Your wife is an AH and you both know it. Your daughter will prioritize the other relationships in her life the way you model prioritizing hers.", "Off topic, but when you say \"my daughter,\" does that mean your current wife is the stepmother?", "NTA for giving your daughter the cleats but I am side eying you hard for why you waited so long in the first place \n\nWhy are you letting your wife abuse your little girl for IG views?\n\nBecause that is exactly what your wife was doing and you need to stop it now!!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

HER FEET ARE GOING NUMB FROM WEARING SHOES THAT ARE TOO SMALL!!", "Best comment!!", "And you know she's not going to put the numbing of her feet or the condition of her toenails in the IG video because people would rip her to shreds. I mean how do you tell your kid they can't wear their much-needed new cleats so that their mom can make some click bate for IG. There are some major flags here, one parents wants to make click bate and another parent that won't put a stop to it for the health of their child."]}
