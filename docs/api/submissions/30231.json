Birdy was 20 when she died. She had been diagnosed with cancer a year before her death. She knew she was dying so she made a will for the very few things she had. It was mostly sentimental childhood stuff she had. Old stuffys and she had a necklace that our dad bought her. Stuff like that. It wasn't a lot. But she left it all to me. She also wrote a letter to me before she died.\n\nBut anyway, I was the only person who got anything from Birdy. She left our grandparents (paternal) in charge of everything until I'm 18 or until I'm out of mom's house.\n\nThe problem with this is mom has other kids. Birdy and I lost our dad when we were both kids. Mom remarried. Neither of us really cared much for mom's husband and when mom had more kids, we didn't feel the same about them as we did each other. Birdy was more vocal while I didn't say anything. Mostly I didn't want to fight with mom over it and I didn't want to hurt anybody's feelings. But Birdy and mom never really got along and it was only worse after dad died and then mom remarried.\n\nThe fact Birdy left nothing for our half siblings and never even wrote them a goodbye letter bothers mom and it really upset them because they wanted to know why she wrote to me and left me her stuff but not them. They wanted to read my letter but I said no.\n\nIt became a fight with mom then and she wanted to know why Birdy left the rest of the family nothing and why even when she knew she was dying she couldn't find a way to embrace the other kids enough to give them something, a small goodbye.\n\nI showed mom the letter because Birdy wrote a lot about her feelings and mentioned things she and I talked about when mom wasn't around. I knew the letter would be a lot. Birdy said clearly she never loved or cared about the other kids at all and wanted me to know that she didn't want them to have anything but if I felt differently, if I ended up loving them one day and wanted to give them something of hers, that she wouldn't be mad.\n\nMom read the whole thing twice, if not three times, and then she asked me why I had shown her the letter and what did I want to do with her. She was so mad she was shaking and she told me I was never to show my half siblings and I pointed out I had said no to them reading it already. Nothing else was said that day but then mom told me I was cruel for rubbing my sister's words in her face and she wanted me to know she might never be able to forgive me for it. She told me forgiveness would be off the table if I ever breathed a word of it to her other kids.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1699025840, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17mxtf9/aita_for_showing_my_mom_the_letter_my_sister/", "score": 5647, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She asked and didn\u2019t like the answer.  That answer was not yours, it was birdy\u2019s and in her own words.  I am sure it stung like hell, but, she asked.  It is not right or fair for her to be mad at you for giving her what she wanted.  Birdy had the right to do with her stuff what she wanted.  It would be best not to ever show the letter to the others, unless they push you into it.  My guess would be that they are going to, at some point, be jealous if there is any real money waiting for you and not them.  If you don\u2019t have to hurt them then don\u2019t if possible.

Your mom should not have said those things. I hope she doesn't mean it.\n\nDon't show the letter to any of your step siblings. I think your mom is clearly oblivious to how you and your sister feel. As a mother, it is her job to check in on you, make sure you feel emotionally safe and loved, and to help you work through your feelings. She isn't doing that clearly. You should talk to her about how you feel about your relationship with her after you lost your dad. Why you feel the way you feel about your \"new\" family. Why your sister felt that way. Tell her how hurt you are by the fact that she beleives its your fault for showing her the letter. She wanted to know. You tried to hide it. You are only 16.

I bet she knows she missed her Chance to console things while your sister was still alive but that's not on you!", "NTA, and my sympathy for the loss of your sister. Your mom, however, is a piece of work.  She practically demanded you hand over the letter left by your sister and then blamed you for its contents.", "She explicitly asked to know what Birdys reasoning was, and you gave it to her.

And you didn't \"rub your sister's words in her face.\" You simply gave in to **her request** to understand. \n\nOf course, it's complicated because your mother is grieving the loss of her daughter, but the way she is abusing you is unacceptable.\n\nI'm sorry.", "So you're mom demanded and fought to see the letter, and then asked you why you let her?\n\nWait till you're out of the house to say this, but in the future she should trust you more.

I also hope she doesn't have the guts to ask you to give them something from your sister, that would just be a lie.  \nPlus, as they grow up, children will end up learning the truth anyway, secrets always end up coming out of the wood one way or another.", "NTA\n\nNever, never, NEVER ask a question you don't want an answer to.", "NTA, your mom sounds abusive, no wonder Birdy didn't get along with her, her reaction is manipulative. \n\nHopefully you can find a way to distance yourself from her when you're old enough.", "NTA.\n\nI have to ding Birdy a little bit here for not being clear with your mom about her decision to leave everything to you and not your half siblings before she died.

And it shouldn't have been a total surprise either.\n\nYour mother is an asshole here.  I can't fault her for wanting there to have been a better relationship between you and Birdy and the other kids or having a hard time accepting that that isn't the way it is.  But what I can fault her over is saying you were \"rubbing it in her face\" when you showed her the letter.  You didn't even want to show your Mom the letter, you knew it would hurt her, and you only did when it became clear your Mom wouldn't let it go.  It's extremely unfair of her to blame you for showing her since it's what SHE was asking for - to understand how Birdy felt.  \n\nI think she's right that you need to be careful how you treat your half siblings here.  They're innocent here.  They all probably do understand on some level that Birdy didn't love them but they don't need to hear that she actually wrote down that she never loved them at all.

You got into an argument over Birdy's wishes and she wanted to know why Birdy's wishes were what they were... so you showed her exactly *why* they were what they were. **NONE of that is YOUR fault.**\n\nAnd third of all, this:\n\n>Nothing else was said that day but then mom told me I was cruel for rubbing my sister's words in her face and she wanted me to know she might never be able to forgive me for it. She told me forgiveness would be off the table if I ever breathed a word of it to her other kids.\n\n...is manipulative AF and really shitty parenting. It's no wonder Birdy never accepted your mom's new husband and resultant kids. I can only imagine what their relationship was like.\n\nAll that said, I am so very sorry for your loss and I hope that your sister's passing was as peaceful and painless as possible.", "The one issue I have with the narrative is there\u2019s no description of how the interaction actually went. It was glossed over as a \u201cfight\u201d which is really subjective and indefinite. We have no sense of whether the letter was hesitatingly offered as condolence and an attempt of appeasement or shoved across a table with a curt \u201cread it and weep.\u201d I doubt either extreme is true and the truth is just hurt people interacting and seeing the same interaction with different lenses.\n\nI really just hope you and your mom can communicate with one another and find a way forward together.

Mom only got too cause she pushed.\n\nThere's also nothing to be lost for her or OP, so why shouldn't she be able to express things? I mean, if you look at how mom has been trying to force a relationship, I'm betting there's a lot of things that happened that aren't in the post. \n\nHell, mom seems like she doesn't like OP (and didn't like Birdie), because they refused to play happy family for mommy.\n\nAnd really, you say there was no reason, but there very well could have been. And since we'll never know, there's always the: that's what she wanted to express at the time.\n\nI don't think it was to show OP how much she loved him, but more of a trauma bond that they had.\n\nMom is the ultimate asshole here, she's about to disown one kid for something her deceased kid wrote.

I hardly saw him thru my teens (my folks didn\u2019t have an official custody agreement and when my mom moved for school and my brother live with my dad we saw the other parent a couple times a year) he remarried when I was 18 and my stepsister was 12 it was like he got a do over daughter. He spends a lot more time with her son than he ever did with my kids. Which ok fine there are reasons for that, but don\u2019t talk about all the stuff you do with him to my kids when you did none of that stuff with them.", "Yeeeaaahh you did make a lot of assumptions, but probably not all of them wrong. The new wife's children are also all adults, some with their own kids, so I'm not sure how much the \"\"I'll fix my mistake\" really works? Not saying it can't but I just don't really see it when my brother and I literally still exist?? He refused to go to my brother's wedding, stating that he didn't want to cause drama with his ex potentially being there. When I suggested he try therapy to see if that would help him figure out his feelings about it before the wedding (it was like an 8-10 month span between the refusal and the date of the wedding). \n\nI don't hate him at all anyway. Even if he was really shitty I wouldn't hate him, I'm not sure I can. I practically idolized him my whole life, and only recently realized he was kinda emotionally absent in our childhood. I think it's more of just... Severe disappointment and a bit of loss. The woman who raised us kids, that he divorced, was abusive. There's no doubt about that. She lashed out at all of us and it was terrible. But when he divorced her and got remarried, I suddenly wasn't allowed to talk about her, say her name, anything like that, on threat of losing a place up live. When I was in therapy for awhile he talked to me at one point saying \"do you really need this, because I don't want to pay for something that isn't doing anything\". And finally when his new wife treated me the *exact same way* that the abusive woman did, I literally gestured to him as if \"really? You're okay with this one doing this even though you literally just divorced the other one for doing this????\" He just shrugged and walked away.\n\nHe's said that he just wants to be happy and he should be allowed to be happy. And that's fair, I don't want to make anyone suffer. But I would still say that it felt like he chose his new family over us and just has blinders on. Refusing to see anything that could make him unhappy.\n\nI'm not entirely sure if I even *blame* him, it more just feels like grief. Grief of losing the ideal of someone. Grief of watching someone close out the world just to maintain their happiness. Grief of realizing that he thinks my brother and I don't need him just because we're adults, when I see others' stories of having their parents to fall back on. I think it's just... Realizing he's not as great as I thought he was. But not hate. I'm still trying to figure out if \"mad\", I can't really say for sure.\n\nAnd I in no way meant to imply my situation was exactly the same as OP's either. I understand it's completely different. Just... It stings, the idea that people just...

Why do you think people are obliged to love blood relations?\n\nIt isn't weird to have no love for the children of people you dislike, even if one of those people is your parent, though it is unfortunate. It also wouldn't be weird if she had loved them. The thing that seems weird to me is that you expect her to have loved children to whom her only connection is a person she disliked.", "She might have figured out how to care for them when she was older and free of her mom's and stepdad's house.
