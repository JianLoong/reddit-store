Birdy was 20 when she died. She had been diagnosed with cancer a year before her death. She knew she was dying so she made a will for the very few things she had. It was mostly sentimental childhood stuff she had. Old stuffys and she had a necklace that our dad bought her. Stuff like that. It wasn't a lot. But she left it all to me. She also wrote a letter to me before she died.\n\nBut anyway, I was the only person who got anything from Birdy. She left our grandparents (paternal) in charge of everything until I'm 18 or until I'm out of mom's house.\n\nThe problem with this is mom has other kids. Birdy and I lost our dad when we were both kids. Mom remarried. Neither of us really cared much for mom's husband and when mom had more kids, we didn't feel the same about them as we did each other. Birdy was more vocal while I didn't say anything. Mostly I didn't want to fight with mom over it and I didn't want to hurt anybody's feelings. But Birdy and mom never really got along and it was only worse after dad died and then mom remarried.\n\nThe fact Birdy left nothing for our half siblings and never even wrote them a goodbye letter bothers mom and it really upset them because they wanted to know why she wrote to me and left me her stuff but not them. They wanted to read my letter but I said no.\n\nIt became a fight with mom then and she wanted to know why Birdy left the rest of the family nothing and why even when she knew she was dying she couldn't find a way to embrace the other kids enough to give them something, a small goodbye.\n\nI showed mom the letter because Birdy wrote a lot about her feelings and mentioned things she and I talked about when mom wasn't around. I knew the letter would be a lot. Birdy said clearly she never loved or cared about the other kids at all and wanted me to know that she didn't want them to have anything but if I felt differently, if I ended up loving them one day and wanted to give them something of hers, that she wouldn't be mad.\n\nMom read the whole thing twice, if not three times, and then she asked me why I had shown her the letter and what did I want to do with her. She was so mad she was shaking and she told me I was never to show my half siblings and I pointed out I had said no to them reading it already. Nothing else was said that day but then mom told me I was cruel for rubbing my sister's words in her face and she wanted me to know she might never be able to forgive me for it. She told me forgiveness would be off the table if I ever breathed a word of it to her other kids.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1699025840, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17mxtf9/aita_for_showing_my_mom_the_letter_my_sister/", "score": 1545, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She asked and didn\u2019t like the answer.  That answer was not yours, it was birdy\u2019s and in her own words.  I am sure it stung like hell, but, she asked.  It is not right or fair for her to be mad at you for giving her what she wanted.  Birdy had the right to do with her stuff what she wanted.  It would be best not to ever show the letter to the others, unless they push you into it.  My guess would be that they are going to, at some point, be jealous if there is any real money waiting for you and not them.  If you don\u2019t have to hurt them then don\u2019t if possible.

Your mom should not have said those things. I hope she doesn't mean it.\n\nDon't show the letter to any of your step siblings. I think your mom is clearly oblivious to how you and your sister feel. As a mother, it is her job to check in on you, make sure you feel emotionally safe and loved, and to help you work through your feelings. She isn't doing that clearly. You should talk to her about how you feel about your relationship with her after you lost your dad. Why you feel the way you feel about your \"new\" family. Why your sister felt that way. Tell her how hurt you are by the fact that she beleives its your fault for showing her the letter. She wanted to know. You tried to hide it. You are only 16.

If anything it's sad and quite literally speaks volumes about the relationship between your mom and your sister, if she didn't even know that bevore.

I bet she knows she missed her Chance to console things while your sister was still alive but that's not on you!", "NTA, and my sympathy for the loss of your sister. Your mom, however, is a piece of work.  She practically demanded you hand over the letter left by your sister and then blamed you for its contents.", "She explicitly asked to know what Birdys reasoning was, and you gave it to her.

And you didn't \"rub your sister's words in her face.\" You simply gave in to **her request** to understand. \n\nOf course, it's complicated because your mother is grieving the loss of her daughter, but the way she is abusing you is unacceptable.\n\nI'm sorry.", "So you're mom demanded and fought to see the letter, and then asked you why you let her?\n\nWait till you're out of the house to say this, but in the future she should trust you more.

I also hope she doesn't have the guts to ask you to give them something from your sister, that would just be a lie.  \nPlus, as they grow up, children will end up learning the truth anyway, secrets always end up coming out of the wood one way or another.", "NTA\n\nNever, never, NEVER ask a question you don't want an answer to.", "NTA, your mom sounds abusive, no wonder Birdy didn't get along with her, her reaction is manipulative. \n\nHopefully you can find a way to distance yourself from her when you're old enough.", "NTA.\n\nI have to ding Birdy a little bit here for not being clear with your mom about her decision to leave everything to you and not your half siblings before she died.

And it shouldn't have been a total surprise either.\n\nYour mother is an asshole here.  I can't fault her for wanting there to have been a better relationship between you and Birdy and the other kids or having a hard time accepting that that isn't the way it is.  But what I can fault her over is saying you were \"rubbing it in her face\" when you showed her the letter.  You didn't even want to show your Mom the letter, you knew it would hurt her, and you only did when it became clear your Mom wouldn't let it go.  It's extremely unfair of her to blame you for showing her since it's what SHE was asking for - to understand how Birdy felt.  \n\nI think she's right that you need to be careful how you treat your half siblings here.  They're innocent here.  They all probably do understand on some level that Birdy didn't love them but they don't need to hear that she actually wrote down that she never loved them at all.

Could she have left a token to her half-siblings - yes and it would have been nice of her.
