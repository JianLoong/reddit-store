Gramdma's money, grandma's decision. \n\nSorry, but you can't buy dignity. That's just bs.  Grandma died an estranged son. Son needs to live with it and not rob his children.", "NTA \n\nIt\u2019s not your dad\u2019s birthright, your grandmother decided who she wanted her estate to go to and it wasn\u2019t him.\n\nStand your ground, don\u2019t let his greed change your mind.", "While it\u2019s possible that understanding more of the backstory could change my judgment, I\u2019m saying NTA - because your parents\u2019 current behavior and attempts to guilt you make me think they were the ones most at fault for the falling out with grandma in the first place. \n\nAn inheritance is not a birthright. No one is obliged to share their own money with anyone else, regardless of the relationship.", "NTA, dad sounds entitled. I can understand your parents cutting off contact with one side of the family over issues either party cannot resolve, but when it\u2019s both sides and they\u2019ve isolated you from either side of your extended family, then your parents are the problem. \n\nYour parents are bullying you into taking care of your dad\u2019s ego so he can be at the \u201csame level\u201d with your uncles, but he didn\u2019t get the money because for whatever reason, he did not deserve it.\n\nDon\u2019t give in to them and stand your ground.", "NTA.", "NTA\n\nYour grandma chose to bypass her sone intentionally and give this money to you.  Please don't let your father bully you into going against her wishes.", "NTA.\n\nFirst, there could be tax implications for gifting the funds anyway.\n\nSecond, NTA. Whatever the reason for the estrangement, it was a choice your father and mother made. You had a relationship. You would be the AH for dishonoring your grandmother's wishes.\n\nI know several families broken up by these types of situations. What it comes down to though is that no one is \\*entitled\\* to someone else's money. This was not your father's \\*birthright\\*. He didn't have a birthright to someone else's money. This is not a hereditary title - he's not part of a monarchy. \n\nPlease keep the money. You will always regret it if you hand it over. Quite honestly, I think the very first thing you need to do is ask the estate attorney for recommendations for financial planners, interview them and find a financial planner to sit down with and make a real plan for your future. Save it. Invest it. Eventually use it towards the purchase of a house. Your Grandma gave you this money to help you get a good start in life because she loves you. She did not give it to your Dad because of his choices.", "NTA \n\nIf your grandmother had wished your father to have the money, she'd have given it to him. He chose to maintain his \"dignity\" by cutting himself off from her for the last years of her life. Whatever his reasons are, even if they're good ones (which I doubt given his other behavior), he doesn't get to have it both ways.\n\nObviously you're afraid of \"losing the only family you have left\". But ask yourself how much of a loss it really is if the price of remaining \"family\" with them is to hand over the cash that's rightfully yours. If all you are to them is your bank account then I'd say keep the money.", "It\u2019s your money. If you gave it to your parents, do you think they would suddenly love and respect you?", "Did you like your grandma? Do you want to disrespect her last wish?

If he sent her a text he could\u2019ve visited her. How dare he lecture about filial responsibility when he shirked his. He hasn\u2019t even given you the whole story yet about the rift. Unfortunately, they\u2019re forcing you to buy your parent\u2019s love", "NTA - Seems like your grandma knew what kind of person your dad is.  She left that $$ to you and your sibling for a reason.", "They are my parents. I love them. I want to retain a relationship with them.", "They don\u2019t love you. They want your money.  The way they speak is disgusting. They \u201c allowed you to have a relationship and didn\u2019t cut you off from her\u201d is incredibly disrespectful and controlling.  Your brother shouldn\u2019t have rolled over but from the way you talk about them you both have clearly had years of abuse from them.  \n\nPlease get some therapy and realise this is not a normal family dynamic.  They are toxic, controlling and abusive.  Do NOT give them a penny of your money.", "But they dont love you.  I am a parent and if my kid got this, I be happy for their future. \n\nYour parents dont love you, they love the money, they care about status, not you.  \n\n\nIt hard, but make your own family.", "They will use that fact to demand more if you give them anything at all. Please keep your distance for the sake of your future mental health.", "This is a big family conflict, but OP has stated she loves her parents and wants to be connected to them. It does nothing to propose the exact opposite of OP's wishes. \n\nParents can love their kids but fail them for all sorts of good and bad reasons. Greed is a terrible thing. And the parents are doing awful things, but cutting people off can be incredibly final and have other repercussions that people aren't prepared to deal with."]}
