I\u2019m sorry but it isn\u2019t his birthright to get that money. Your parents are also in financial distress, is this because their own actions or some freak accident? If they didn\u2019t plan well and are now in a bind, giving them money won\u2019t necessarily fix anything long term. \n\nIt\u2019s your money, if your father rights you off too for keeping it, he\u2019s a shit parent.

Stand your ground on this.", "NTA, your parents it seems didn't care a bit about your grandmother but still feel like they have a right to ask for money. They are adults who are responsible for earning money themselves. If they have money issues that is their own problem especially when they are now asking for money that was given to YOU by your grandmother and not them. The point that your parents don't respect your grandmother's wishes for what she wanted to happen to the estate show what kind of people they are. It disgusts me that they never cared for her but now when she is dead are going around asking you for the money. I understand why your grandmother made the decision she made. The decision is yours to make but something tells me that they won't stop behaving like this.", "NTA. \n\nYour grandmother was clear in her wishes that you, your brother, and your paternal uncles were her heirs. Your father chose not to visit her in her final days and paid for that decision with disinheritance. The money grandma left you is yours. Spend it how you wish.", "NTA. Your parents are guilt tripping you because they saw the money as a guaranteed thing. Your father wanted nothing to do with your grandmother, but is perfectly happy to take her money, which is completely hypocritical. \n\nTheir lack of planning does not constitute an emergency on yours, and the fact that there is even a suggestion that they may cut you out for not caving shows where their priorities are. Stand your ground.", "NTA\n\n\"For dignity\" is not a compelling reason to give up your financial security.\n\nIf they won't even tell you what the fight was about, you have no way of knowing if the estrangement was justified. Tell them the truth is the ante for even considering their request.\n\nNot that I would even trust their version.

It honestly sounds like your dad should be happy he got anything at all.", "NTA - can you go and stay somewhere else and go NC with them?  This is abusive.  Your brother shouldn't give in either.", "NTA it was your grandmother's money and not your dad's. She wished for you and your brother to have it. Your parents aren't going to appreciate it if you give it to them because your dad sees it as his.  I don't know what kind of parents they've been, but they look pretty selfish and entitled. You might be better off without them.", "NTA\n\nThis was never your Dad\u2019s money. It was your grandmother\u2019s and now it is yours.

I am sorry for the loss of your grandmother.", "HARD agree!!!!!  Think about this OP, there are some people who leave nothing to their family and give it all to charity instead. That put the whole \u201cbirth rite\u201d thing into perspective for me. NTA", "***bUt m'BiRtHrIgHtS!*** OPs dad can fuck right off with this bullshit. What a shitty excuse for shitty people to get what they think is *owed* them because someone they fell out of owned it. Not your property, asshole.

It\u2019s not smart to give it up.", "Agreed\n\n> your parents\u2019 current behavior and attempts to guilt you make me think they were the ones most at fault for the falling out with grandma in the first place.\n\nThat certainly sounds likely. OP, if they are willing to throw away their relationship with you because you don't want to give them your money, then there is every reason that they threw away their (and your) relationship with everyone else if they refused to comply with your parent's unfair demands.\n\nCan you talk to the estranged part of the family and get the whole story? \n\nIf you decide to give them them your money, then what? He can't buy dignity and you can't buy love and decency from them.

That's not a relationship.", "I won't go as far as saying they don't love you, but man...they are walking the line.

It seems that you will have to choose either the money or your parents. And if you choose the money, which is 100% legally yours and your parents have no claim to it at all, you may well have to go no contact with them. Like others have suggested, I would reach out to your other relatives and get the other side of the story of why your parents were cut out. But you have every right to that money, and your grandmother wanted you to have it, regardless of what your parents say. Good luck.", "You can\u2019t blackmail your own children to give you their money or they won\u2019t love you and will cut contact with you. Your grandma left you money because she wants you to have it. She specifically didn\u2019t want your father to have it. Give him the money and you\u2019ll have gone directly against her wishes, do you want that?", "This is a painful situation for a loving son, and I\u2019m all sympathy. What a position you\u2019re in!

They say it was because the family judged them beyond reasons that were reparable\u201d \n\nWhew! So there\u2019s a lot of family history here that is being kept from you. You\u2019re supposed to just fork over the cash obediently without them honoring you with the truth? It appears the uncaring that you observed in your father at the time of your grandmother\u2019s final illness had actually been of long standing. You got that money because of dad\u2019s awfulness. Grandma knew something that you still don\u2019t. His demanding that money CONFIRMS he\u2019s undeserving. His dignity is long gone. He knows what he did. Don\u2019t protect him from the consequences of his actions. Honor your grandmother\u2019s wishes.
