That they are also threatening to cut you off from them is another red flag. Also, that your father has no means of income is a further concern. Something isn't right here and I've a feeling that your parents are trying to manipulate you and your brother.\n\nPlease don't make any rash decisions with the money that you've inherited. Get as much information as you can about the situation from other relatives and make a decision that's best for you.", "You already don\u2019t have a real father or a real mother in your life.  Seek out extended family and I think you\u2019ll be able to build some valued relationships.", "I don\u2019t know what you are talking about, sorry.", "OP should definitely keep the money, and so does OP's brother. \n\nIf the money is birthright to the father, than it is also birthright to his kids and he can be happy that the kids get to use the sum wothout him spending it all.\n\nStupid crap about birthright. He wasn't there when his mom was dying, OP was. It was grandmother's money and it was up to her to decide what to do with it.\n\nIf OP and OP's brother are giving the money to their father (how will that work taxwise...) they would be disrespecting their grandmother for a father who didn't respect his own mother, nor respects his 2 kids...\n\nNTA and learn to be independent from your asshole's father's opinion of you. You don't need his approval to live a good life. You've got grandmother's money for it.\n\nAnd being an asshole, no amount of money in the world would give your dad \"dignity\"", "we have that here in the states", "You are correct. If the original poster\nIn in the US, giving over $12,000.00 would mean that the original poster would be required to file a gift tax return, not that they would owe gift taxes.", "\u261d\ufe0f\u261d\ufe0f\u261d\ufe0f", "Going NC might seem hard now but over time you adjust. I promise that freedom from manipulation and selfishness is a gift you can give yourself. And it keeps giving everyday.", "Yeah, your parents are the common denominator in this equation.", "And for the sake of your financial health.", "I\u2019ve heard some stories from only my mother of what happened (my father has never talked to me about it). They said my grandmother was telling them how to raise their children/religious persuasion so they cut her off because of that.  They\u2019ve told me on my mothers side they didn\u2019t see eye to eye with my aunt and my other grandmother. I have heard different stories here and there of the reasoning behind it but I\u2019ve only heard this from my parents , never my grandmother or other family members.", "Yeah but we usually call it Kraft Mac and cheese. \n\nOP is NTA. Grandma specifically did not want her son/OP\u2019s dad to have the money. Even if they were estranged for a trivial reason, it\u2019s her money and she can decide what to do with it.\n\nSend your parents a box of Kraft dinner and some fancy ketchup, and tell them to get lost.", "but you don't call it that", "No, the boxes say Kraft Mac n Cheese in the States. Same product known by different names.", "Yes, such as improved mental health, less unreasonable feelings of guilt, less emotional blackmail, greater sense of self worth and respect\u2026 \n\nRegardless of whatever love the parents may feel towards OP, their actions and attitude can only be described as toxic. Sure cutting them out; or severely reducing contact, will hurt alot, but will likely ultimately be the far more healthy choice for OP.", "Fanciest Dijon ketchup", "Actually, here in Minnesota a lot of people call it Kraft dinner as well.", "I think what someone in the US calls it might depend on when it became a staple in their diet. My mom always called it Kraft Dinner (so both my brother and I did) and that was in the 70s. I'm not sure when Kraft re-branded it to Mac & cheese here in the US", "Yes we do", "They do now, they did not always say that here. The boxes in the US said Kraft Dinner until they re-branded here   Perhaps you are not old enough to remember. I am from and was raised here in the US as was my mother so she didn\u2019t carry calling Kraft Dinner from living elsewhere", "Only if you have a million dollars.", "But not a real green dress, that\u2019s cruel!", "I am old enough, and also US born and raised. But you can trust that whenever someone says Kraft Dinner, they are Canadian. Today, not back in the day."]}
