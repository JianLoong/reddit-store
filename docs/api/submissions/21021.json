I was gifted the dress, and my sister received jewelry (including pieces that my mother wore on her wedding day). \n\nMy sister is engaged, and she recently asked me to gift my mother's dress to her so she could wear it on her wedding day. I told her \"no\" for various reasons: \n\n1. The dress was gifted to me specifically, and it's one of the last few meaningful possessions of my mother's that I have.\n\n2. My sister is probably 3-4 sizes larger than my mother. Nothing against her (she's healthy and beautiful), but wearing the dress would require her to let the dress out at the seams, requiring much of the embroidery and beading to be destroyed and re-done. I do not have faith that the dress can be properly restored and maintained. \n\n3. My sister implied that as a gift, it would then become hers. I asked if that meant she'd give me some of my mother's jewelry in return, and she said no, which rubbed me the wrong way. BTW, I don't actually want to trade (the dress has too much sentimental value to me). I just wanted to see where my sister's heart was at, and it felt selfish to me. \n\nShe's since started a campaign about me to family, She's been crying to my dad and writing nasty things about how selfish I am.

It was given to you. It would require alteration. It's something you care about.  \n\n\nedit: I should add that I'm so sorry for what you're going through OP! It just seemed so clear that I made a quick post, but I realise that this is your family. I'm so sorry, but your sister is still wrong and being a jerk to you. I hope you can resolve it, but no matter what, you're in the right.", "NTA. Firstly, a dress like that sounds so delicate and it wouldn't be worth it to rework it. Your sister won't essentially trade you something else, and she assumes she'd get the dress not just borrow.\n\nLastly, your sister is a major AH for bringing up that you're a widow. I would go low contact with your sister, if not no contact. The widow comment sealed that for me. You're not ruining her wedding- her dramatic antics and heartless behaviors are.", "NTA - Your mom wanted you to have it. That's special and you should treasure that. \n\nI would be vulnerable in how you communicate about this with your family. It sounds like your sister is being nasty but don't do the same. Just tell everyone that the dress is a special memory for you, and your mom has specific wishes for it which you plan to honor.", "NTA and please please please hide that dress!!! Have you ever seen 27 Dresses??!", ">She's even brought up the fact that I'm a widow (likely to never remarry)\n\nWhat a shitty thing to say to someone you're trying to sweet-talk for a favor!\n\nNot that it needs to be all about *quid pro quo*, but sis's unwillingness to trade is unreasonable. If she wants to take from you (and keep) one of the few things that was left to you by your mother, the least she could do is offer something in return. Very entitled to do otherwise.\n\nNTA. Keep the dress in one piece and hand it down to an appropriate recipient someday.", "NTA. And if she\u2019s going to guilt trip you, you can do it to her, by telling her that your mother would be horrified that she was even asking. \n\nAnd the fact that she brought up that you\u2019re a widow, wow! That\u2019s one of those shittier things I\u2019ve heard today, and I\u2019ve been listening to US Supreme Court news all day.", "NTA. Keep the dress nice and safe. Enjoy your memory of your mother and don\u2019t let anyone tell you otherwise. Your sister can wear the jewelry.", "NTA.\n\nIf you give her the dress now, it becomes hers. She will pass it down to her children, grandchildren and so on. You will lose a treasured family heirloom.

Hold your ground firmly.", "Send her pictures of the dress, with the name of a good seamstress to duplicate and lock up the original dress.  I would be very direct, that her needing to alter dress 3 sizes would destroy dress.  That your mother had clear instructions in her will, and you are honoring that by not allowing dress to be destroyed by alterations.  \n\nI'm sorry for your loss!! But you are NTA.", "Simple NTA\n\nThe dress is yours, the jewellery is hers, it was a gift to you that would be damaged and not returned. It is meaningful to you, she has other items that are hers.

Making it big enough for you will ruin My inheritance, and our mother\u2019s priceless gown. Sorry to be so frank, but there it is. So, NO you will NOT be getting the dress.\u201d\n\nSecure the dress, store it away from your family so it is not stolen. You might consider getting photos of the dress so your sister could have a similar dress made. \n\nGood luck, OP.", "NTA \n\nIt's your inheritance.  The dress will not be able to be salvaged, nor will you be able to wear it in the future. The only way I would even entertain it would be with a refundable deposit of $50000 paid in advance and the condition that no alterations are to be made. She will need to go down to the size of the dress.", "NTA, it\u2019s yours, it means something, and you aren\u2019t getting in return. Sister is a AH for being mad that you won\u2019t give up a memory of your mother for nothing.", "NTA. The dress belongs to you, point blank. Your sister is not entitled to it, despite her clearly thinking otherwise.  I'd also argue that though you may not ever *wear* it, that doesn't mean you don't get something out of it.", "NTA.  your sister sounds very entitled.  Your mother selected you for her wedding dress, our sister got the jewelry.  I think that your sister's comments about the odds being low that you will never wear the dress are are very catty,  Please  consider storing your dress in a safe (secret) place, so the your sister and  family members don't take it.", "NTA. Her nasty behavior alone is reason enough to not give her the dress. Make sure you put your dress in a place where she can\u2019t get to it. Also tell your dad that it is extremely unfair for your sister to demand the one thing you were loved and were gifted from your mom. Btw, you are not ruining her wedding but she is by her nastiness. Tell your sister if she doesn\u2019t stop her nonsense that you will go no contact and refuse to go to her wedding. Dear OP. Your sister is being unreasonable, unfair and mean spirited. Stand your ground. You deserve better!!!!", "NTA. But sister...... wow she is some piece of work.", "NTA.  I wouldn't let her borrow it at this point, even if it were her size.", "NTA Your mom's possessions were split between the two of you. The dress is yours. The audacity to not only ask to wear the dress knowing it will be permanently altered, but to keep it afterward is astounding.", "NTA. You got the dress because your mother requested it. If she wanted your sister to have it she would have arranged that. Your sister doesn't need to take the one thing you have from your mom and it doesn't even fit. Sis obviously doesn't want to buy a dress and is making it your problem.\n\nEdit: I'd consider cutting ties with her and the family if they're just going to make you the bad guy and insult you for being a widow. You deserve the dress because it was given to you and if you're the one ruining the wedding then don't go.", "NTA. But from stories similar to this.... HIDE YOUR DRESS!  It is yours, don't let bullies take it from you.", "NTA stand your ground, you inherited the dress and she intends to keep it. For the same reason she would keep it I.E. she wore it to her wedding is the same reasons you shouldn\u2019t part with it.\n\nAnd to double down her petty campaign is all the more reason to not let go of the dress.", "NTA. Stand your ground and don\u2019t let your sister bully you into giving it to her.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nPlease make sure the dress is somewhere safe where she and your father can't get to it. I have a bad feeling on this one....", "NTA, there is no way to alter the dress that much without totally making a repurposed dress.  Your mother gave you the dress.  Is there a friend or relative of your late husband that can store the dress.  I would not put it past her stealing it.", "NTA. But I would go take the dress to a safe place. Bridezillas is a word for a reason. All reason goes out the window and brides do anything to have the \"perfect\" day.", "NTA. Explain to your father the dress your mother wore walking down the aisle to him will be destroyed to accommodate your sister as women today are rarely the size of their mothers. Tell your sister you will gift the dress to her after she gifts you the jewelry your mother gave her. When she refuses, ask her why.
