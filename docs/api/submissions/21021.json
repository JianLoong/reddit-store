Her nasty behavior alone is reason enough to not give her the dress. Make sure you put your dress in a place where she can\u2019t get to it. Also tell your dad that it is extremely unfair for your sister to demand the one thing you were loved and were gifted from your mom. Btw, you are not ruining her wedding but she is by her nastiness.

I wouldn't let her borrow it at this point, even if it were her size.", "NTA Your mom's possessions were split between the two of you. The dress is yours. The audacity to not only ask to wear the dress knowing it will be permanently altered, but to keep it afterward is astounding.", "NTA. You got the dress because your mother requested it. If she wanted your sister to have it she would have arranged that. Your sister doesn't need to take the one thing you have from your mom and it doesn't even fit. Sis obviously doesn't want to buy a dress and is making it your problem.\n\nEdit: I'd consider cutting ties with her and the family if they're just going to make you the bad guy and insult you for being a widow.

I have a bad feeling on this one....", "NTA, there is no way to alter the dress that much without totally making a repurposed dress.  Your mother gave you the dress.

Explain to your father the dress your mother wore walking down the aisle to him will be destroyed to accommodate your sister as women today are rarely the size of their mothers.

To find someone able to replicate the pattern to accomodate for the extra fabric would be expensive and difficult. Even finding a fabric match that isn\u2019t an obvious addition would be extremely hard. \nIt would be costly, time consuming, and it wouldn\u2019t be the same dress. Still beautiful, but obviously altered. \n\nThinking about the hand embroidery and beading on OPs wedding dress\u2026.that\u2019s even more difficult I\u2019m sure!

While\nI\u2019m sure OPs mum would consider the sisters request, I think she\u2019d also respect OP preserving it as is because she passed the dress to OP for a reason. \n\nSister is not out of line for asking, but it shows a lack of understanding of the complications to assume it would be as simple as an alteration. Sister would not receive the dress OP has after alterations, and, if she even was willing to return it, OP would not be getting the same dress back. \n\nI\u2019ll never wear my dancing dress again until I get off birth control. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll have children of my own to pass it on too. I hope to keep it in beautiful condition and give it to a niece (or nephew) who will cherish it as I do, who will take it out dancing the way my grandmother did. \nI would never give it to one of my sisters to let out and wear, even if they begged.
