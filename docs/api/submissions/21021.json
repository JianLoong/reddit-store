When she married my father, her employer designed and created a bespoke dress for my mother as a wedding gift. The dress is stunning. I know it sounds hyperbolic, but it's honestly a work of art (hand embroidered, hand beaded, the whole nine yards).Before she passed, my mother spilt up several of her possessions based on our personalities, and was explicit about who got what in her will. I was gifted the dress, and my sister received jewelry (including pieces that my mother wore on her wedding day).\n\nOk but OP never mentions that she plans to wear the dress, I get that it would pretty much butcher the dress to upsize it that far (i sew), but i still think that belongings only exist to make us happy, and it would bring her sister more joy to be able to wear it, than for it to sit somewhere forgotten til it gets chucked out by whoever gets it down the line. Im not saying OP is the A.H. just that they both have different worldviews so neither is exactly an A.H.", "There are places that clean, pack, and store wedding gowns.

It was lovely of you to try and continue that kindness and make it a tradition. \n\nI think there is beauty in altering dresses and clothes to suit the people who wear them - it\u2019s a living, breathing item with a stitch from everyone who enjoyed it and that is lovely. \n\nBut. BIG but. \nI think it has to be something that the gifted and receiver both agree to and are happy with. Which might be weird. But quite often heirloom or vintage or handmade things are given to be enjoyed \u201cas is\u201d, given to people who will preserve them and act as a custodian almost.  And it\u2019s weird to give a gift with conditions, but I think heirlooms and handmade objects, it\u2019s sort of understood it\u2019s part gift and part responsibility. \n\nMaybe it\u2019s the history nerd in me but there\u2019s a difference between things made to be changed and made to be preserved. Something made to be changed is an opportunity for the person owning it to make it their own. Something made to be preserved is more about a solid through line or connection, a link in a chain of owners who all loved and appreciated this one item. \n\nI am so truly sorry about the dress. It was given with love.", "This is an amazing idea. The sister would need to be ok with the expense of creating it tho - that embroidery and beading would not be cheap. \n\nAnd, not to assume too much, I\u2019m sure the sentiment of the dress is a big part of it but\u2026.the lower cost might also be a factor.

Taking it apart would destroy any pleating, any gathering, probably damaged the fabric if it has tule, lace, chiffon or silk which are very delicate, etc. Not to mention that it wouldn't be cheap if you found someone willing to even do it.

I hope she doesn't make this her hill to die on, but the undoing of your relationship would be due to her behavior, not yours.", "What does OP do, pull the dress out and look at it every day? Do they not have pictures of their mom in the dress? I just really don\u2019t get being so attached to an object, especially one that their mom wore only one time years before they were born or knew what a wedding dress was. \n\nIf OP wants to wear it and that is the reason, that\u2019s fair. But it sounds like they just don\u2019t want the sister to wear it and that sounds petty to me. Like I said before, why didn\u2019t OP wear it at their own wedding? Why didn\u2019t mom gift it to her then? \n\nThis whole story makes no sense and I get that weddings are sensitive for some people but jeez. You can\u2019t tell me that the only thing OP has to remember her mom by is this dress.", "Exactly what I thought of too. That scene infuriates me.", "I thought of the same movie!  Kathryn Heigl\u2019s character was so heartbroken in that scene!  I think that crushed her more than her sister stealing her dream guy. And I was \u201csorry, not sorry\u201d about how she exposed the sister\u2019s phony lies.", "Yes. Whenever there are curved seams, seams are notched and then generally trimmed so that the fabric lays correctly. I have made 2 wedding dresses (simpler) and let out a dress for friends. More than one size will never happen. In a custom dress, I question even 1 size.", "A friend of mine did that very thing.  The dress was tucked off in a corner of his living room and was stunning.  The dress OP describes sounds like a work of art that should be displayed and appreciated.", "Just take lots of pictures", "By your logic OP should keep the dress because it makes her happy, and giving it to her sister would probably stress her out and upset her when the dress was changed", "Same. My mum was a semi-professional seamstress and even as a young teen when I first saw that scene I was livid for a fictionial character because I knew there was no way to undo what had been done. Dresses can't just be let out 3 to 4 sizes, you'd have to add panels and because fabric varies from lot to lot, the chances you'll get a perfect match for a vintage dress is slim to none. Anyway you put it, the dress would have to end up pulled apart at some point. OP's sister would definitely end up destroying this dress no matter what.", "Tell her the alterations to fit her would ruin it. And she wont own. You would never get itback.  \nSell it. 30k", "Be careful with that. My mom had it done with her gown. It was gifted to me for my wedding (I loved the dress, from the photos) and when we opened that box, all that was in there was a bunch of white fabric. They stole the dress, probably to resell, and stuffed the box knowing it would not be opened in decades, if ever.\n\nNTA to the OP, by the way.", "At a show house I went to in Tulsa that is an event venue, in the bride\u2019s room, they had an entire wedding dress mounted in a giant acrylic shadow box.  It was stunning.", "That's so freaking terrible!! I'm so appalled.", "A talk show host brought her stored wedding dress and opened it on the air only to find an empty box.  She was shocked. But it does happen.", "I ship ballet tuts flat in large picture boxes.  Definitely an option to reduce the number of folds", "It very much seams like the sister does not understand the complexity of what she wants.", "Absolutely. I don\u2019t think OP even fully understands it. 3-4 sizes is a bigger jump than you can generally get by just letting out seams, unless quite a bit of seam allowance was worked into the original construction to allow such alterations. Which is unlikely for a wedding dress, since most people expect those to only be worn once. And if it were the case, the embroidery would have also been planned to allow future alteration via letting out seams.", "I would also love to see it!", "I would also love to see it please", "I would love to see it too! It sounds wonderful", "Add me to the list, too, please!", "Seams are usually 5/8\" and often cut or finished smaller when done (especially around curves like bodices, sleeves, necklines.). No way a dress can be let out more than MAYBE one size.", "Me too!", "NTA - I think the question about the jewelry was perfect.  If she wants the dress, she should have been will to trade the jewelry that your mom gave her.  But either way, the dress would be ruined.  Dresses can sometimes be taken in and still look nice, I have never seen one let out several sizes and look anything like the original.  \n\nI'm reminded of the scene in 27 Dresses where the sister destroys the mother's dress and uses \"pieces\" of it for her dress.", "So you\u2019re supposed to give her the wedding dress your mom gave YOU and she keeps all the jewelry? Sooooo you end up with no dress or jewelry, essentially nothing of emotional value from your mom. Your sister doesn\u2019t sound fair at all. NTA", "I wonder why your family would decide that as a widow, you are unlikely to remarry.  \n\n\nDuring Covid, I worked at a seniors' complex as Visitor Liason, and we had SO MANY WEDDINGS between people who had lost spouses earlier, met others, fell in love, and married - in their 70s, 80s, 90s.  \n\n\nSome people lose their spouse and never remarry, but an awful lot of people do, even very late in life.", "Your mom knew something when she left you the dress. Don't give it to her and make sure she doesn't have access to it.\n\nI don't understand why people think insulting someone and talking shit about them makes the other party yo change their mind.\n\nJoke/serious: OP I would have gotten married just to wear the dress.", "NTA\n\nIt was left to you. It sounds like your sister wants what was left to her AND what was left to you. No. Even worse is that the dress would have to be basically destroyed to maybe work for her. And what, you're supposed to be content with losing what your mom left you?  The fact that she won't even trade for jewelry speaks volumes. Put it somewhere safe and enjoy it as the keepsake it is.", "NTA and HIDE THE DRESS!!!!", "NTA. Your mom left it to YOU. It mow belongs to YOU. It\u2019s YOURS. Tell her to kick rocks. If anyone wants to take up the baton on her behalf say that you\u2019re willing to sell it to them. For a few million. Or whatever ridiculous price you can dream up. Maybe That will sink in.", "NTA. Expect to be uninvited or not invited to the wedding.", "Oh no no NTA", "Dresses can be altered up to 2 sizes in either direction. More than that and they have to be recut.", "yes yta. didnt even have to get past the title.  \nEdit: i did read it, evenmoreso yta. its a dress, if A youll never wear it  yta, not allowing her to wear it because youd have to alter it again after, is petty af", "Hi OP,\n\nNTA. technically the dress is yours so it's up to you what you'd like to do with it whether you have a valid reason or not. \n\nIf your sister wasn't planning on keeping the dress or doing a swap with the jewelry I'd say you were being an asshole even with the dilemma with altering the dress.\n\nHer complaining about it still and even making a campaign against you is unreasonable.\n\nsometimes we hold on to things left to us by the deceased too closely with this magical thinking that if anything changes to it then it'll mean the deceased is somehow further away than they already are if that makes sense. Also your mom got what she got out of the dress and left it to be used however. She gave you each items on her best judgement but that doesn't mean she guessed right. \n\nIf your sister wasn't doing a ton of things wrong herself I would suggest trying to work it out but at this point idk if her behavior warrants you to compromise at this time. If she apologizes and makes up for what she's done then maybe you can consider negotiating like: she can borrow the dress but not keep it and limit what alterations she can make to it, or demand you get all of mom's jewelry for the dress as a full swap. \n\ngood luck!", "My grandmother gave me her original engagement ring when I was younger, not long after I got married. My sister was *extremely* jealous for reasons I  don't understand. She was still in high school at the time, not close to being engaged. The only reason I can fathom is that it was not long after I got married and she & I have never had a good relationship. \n\nAbout a year later, we had a cookout at our house with our family and not long after that I realized I could not find that ring ANYWHERE. I tore the house apart looking for my ring, bawling because I lost it. My husband asked me when I had it last, and I told him that I had taken it and another ring off before I had made hamburgers for the cookout. I had either put the rings in our bedroom on my dresser or in one of our bathrooms. I found the other ring, but not the engagement ring. Of course, when I confronted my mom and my sister about this... ABSOLUTELY NOT - SHE WOULD NEVER. Yet, several years later, guess who broke into my parents house and stole my mom's jewelry? Everything of value was taken *except* for her wedding rings. If it had been anyone else, they would have taken all her jewelry.", "Agreed. I was on the fence a bit until the needing alterations part which quickly put it in the no way in hell category.", "Not in your home. Find a friend who does not know your sister.", "Nope. Most ridiculous comment I\u2019ve ever read, right here ^", "You should read it. Dress is the type that would be destroyed if were altered to the 3 to 4 sizes larger that the sister needs. Also, sister wants the dress GIFTED to her, even though sister was left the wedding jewelry and OP was left the dress.", "Op can easily have the dress framed and displayed like painting.  The dress is a work of art, and would be destroyed by alterations.  You can purchase frames that are created just for wedding dresses and people hang them up.\n\n It was made to her mother's exact size, and the embroidery and beading is done for that size, and very likely forms a continuous pattern around and over the seams. \n\n It is not like a dress that is constructed using milled fabrics and embroidery that have a repeating pattern.  Adding the amount of extra fabric needed to change the dress up 4 sizes would look awful.  The labor of adding the beading and embroidery to make it match would be difficult as some part of it would not align properly and look out of place.  To make it look decent and not hacked together is incredibly difficult and time consuming. \n\nOPs sister is  being petty and greedy AF.  \"Give me the dress as a gift!\" Leaving OP with nothing of her mother's to hold on to.  Some people are better at holding onto memories and are satisfied with photos.  Others like something more tangible, that they can touch and feel.", "Yep. The *only* thing that would be plausible, depending on the style of the dress and condition of the fabric, would be for some part or element to be carefully removed and attached to a different dress entirely. Like if there is an overlay in one area that could be removed, or similar.", "I wrote at the end that the OP isn't ruining the wedding but the sister is...", "or give it to a friend who doesn't know your sister and wouldn't betray you.  The dress sounds stunning.  I'd say your sister's the selfish one since she wouldn't give it back to you after her wedding.\n\nI'd also let anyone that contacts you that your mom left it specifically for you, your sister got the jewelry and that your sister told you she wouldn't give the dress back nor share any of mom's jewelry.  you could mention your sister is 3-4 sizes larger than the dress and it would be destroyed", "It belongs in a museum!", "No wedding dress will fit in a safety deposit box.", "What was out of line in asking? Asking OP to *gift* it to her rather than asking to borrow it. That shows a remarkable sense of entitlement.", "This. Sister\u2019s not out of line for asking, but she is out of line for turning the request into a demand and making drama about it when the answer was no. \n\nIt\u2019s not her dress, she never had a reasonable expectation that she\u2019d get to wear it, and it\u2019s not even her size. Altering anything to size up as much as it would need is a huge undertaking that cant be fully un-done, it wouldn\u2019t just be a matter of letting out the seams for a bit of ease, material would have to be added and the shaping would have to be re-structured (sizing up a complex, fitted garment like a wedding dress by 3-4 sizes effectively is not as simple as just making each piece of fabric bigger or inserting panels at the existing seam lines \u2014 that often works well for everyday clothes but a wedding dress is NOT everyday clothes). She has her mother\u2019s wedding jewelry to wear, she hasn\u2019t been left out completely.", "You are correct,  thanks. I played the \"Jumping to Conclusions \" game and lost on that one.\nI agree that the OP is NTA.", "Omg. The exact thought just popped into my head!  I know Marilyn was curvy, but she was still petite. Her death certificate stated she was 5\u20195\u201d and 117lb. People always say she was a size 12, but 1960s dress sizes were different. Currently, 36-24-34 translates to a size 6-8. \n\nAnd there is no way you can squeeze KK\u2019s bulbous ass and gigantic boobs into that dress and not risk splitting the seams. Tell me they didn\u2019t alter MM\u2019s dress for her to walk the carpet??", "Safe deposit boxes at banks come in many sizes. If the dress was professionally cleaned and packed away in a cardboard box (as many people do with their wedding gowns), it would definitively fit in a larger safe deposit box.", "Oh no, none of us felt bad for Tess when she was exposed \ud83d\ude02 you aren't alone lol", "I used to do custom picture framing (at a chain craft store but we still took preservation and design very seriously) and a customer had purchased a beautiful wedding dress from the 1920s at an estate sale and had us frame it in a shadowbox for her to hang.\n\nIn this case we actually folded and pinned the bottom of the dress under it to \"crop\" it so to speak, so it didn't have to be as tall as a person, but it was an awesome way to display the craftsmanship of the stitches and beading and neckline and so on. \n\nSo yes it's definitely doable with lots of different options!", "I used to be a custom picture framer. I framed a wedding dress once. Christening gowns were more popular, but other textiles were often framed too. I framed one of the bodices Gwyneth Paltrow wore in Shakespeare in Love, and more than one kimono that a tourist bought on vacation.", "Self storage places often have climate controlled areas for just such things.", "Or a friend's house", "brilliant idea!", "This might be worth investigating as a way of keeping it safe until after the wedding.", "Or post the imgur link here? Save you having to message it to multiple people?", "Please add me to the list of those wanting to see this dress.  And no, definitely not the AH.  Sister received her inheritance, she doesn't get yours too.", "So want to see the dress!", "I'd guess it's because even though they're saying that the OP is not the asshole, they are still suggesting they try and placate someone who is treating them so horribly.", "It's actually a project that wouldn't be that hard to DIY with industrial hot glue and some nice trim. I mean you'd still have to take care in making it but it's not something that would be impossible or even to challenging to make yourself.", "It would only need to be stored until after sister's wedding.", "Happens quite a bit!", "Me please!", "I want to see it", "Me!", "It is more like the sister wanted to use parts of it to make a new dress.", "That\u2019s the only reason I can think of. The owners, Ripleys, claimed there was no damage but I saw with my own eyes it was a lie. Stretched seams across the hips and missing beading all around that area. The back was worse than the front but I only took one shot of the thing. The gossip is that the K sisters all took a bead from it as a souvenir, and there\u2019s enough missing I totally believe that\u2019s possible.", "Add me also!\n\nAlthough you might not get married again, it was your inheritance from your mother so it is valuable to you for that reason.", "Agree\u2026.my mom has been a seamstress or 65 years, made my wedding dress as well as both my sisters.  There\u2019s nothing she can\u2019t do.  She wouldn\u2019t touch this for anything."]}
