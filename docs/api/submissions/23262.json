The other I would invite but I wouldn't expect to be in the wedding party since we're just not that close. \n\nSo if I were you, after the wedding when things calm down, I'd give some serious thoughts to how the friendship has been going before now. I get that she's a new mom and it's a lot but does she make plans and exceptions for other people and events but not for you?  Is there something specifically about the hen do that doesn't work for her such as the date or is it a long distance? Has she gone out to other events/parties since having the baby? It may be time to reevaluate the relationship. It's also ok for you to back burner it for a while and see if you can pick it up in the future.", " NTA. Why would your long time friend not feel comfortable enough to tell you herself?", "NTA\n\nI would just ask her directly if she is dropping out just incase your friend heard something wrong but if she is dropping out, you have the right to be upset. Not yelling at her but she could have sent you a message. It's not that hard to text someone.", "NTA-she's 31, why does she need to have someone else tell you? how hard is a text?", "Info: was the bachelorette being organised without your input? Was the plan and attendance supposed to be a surprise for you?\n\nWhen we organised my brothers Stag Doo, he has a list of people he would like there, but wasn't told who had booked on and was available. He was unaware of where we were going until we arrived at the gate at the airport. We had packed humiliating outfits to cover his whole weekend.\n\nIf the Bach was supposed to be a surprise then you would be TA but if it wasn't and you were somewhat involved in the planning then you would not be TA", "INFO: how much detail do you have about the when/where? You mentioned it\u2019s a surprise so is it possible she can\u2019t attend on that date for a valid reason and let the host know so she wouldn\u2019t ruin anything?", "NTA, if you talk to her, you should be careful because you don\u2019t want her to think you\u2019re upset simply because she can\u2019t make it to your party. She needs to understand you\u2019re upset that about her lack of communication.", "NTA\n\n\nYes, she should have told you.\n\n\nHaving said that, there's some nonzero possibility that she is really struggling or potentially suffering from post-partum depression.  It might be worthwhile to check in with her to see if things are okay, if perhaps she needs help, or encouragement to see a therapist/psychiatrist.", "NTA. As one of your bridesmaids, it is odd that she couldn't communicate with you directly about this. Are we missing information?", "NTA for being upset but you don't really know what's going on in her life.  Reach out and ask her if everything is OK.  Then let her know you are disappointed that she did not tell you she could not make it personally.", "Right? Like, it's not that big of a deal to send a text to a friend like that. \"I'm so sorry I can't come to the party, I'm really bummed to miss it, have a drink for me and take lots of pics!\"\n\nCould even offer to try and find a time to go for a drink or a coffee just the two of them to celebrate. \n\nIt's so weird to me that this is an issue.", "That's what I thought. As soon as she text the organiser she should have text me.", "The bridesmaid did the right thing.  She received an invitation and she RSVP'ed to the hostess, which is the correct etiquette.  It's an invitation not a royal command.  It is perfectly acceptable to say yes or no without an explanation, therefore, no apology is required.", "This", "I agree with this. I wonder if there was a clash with the other bridesmaid during the organisation of the bachelorette?", "I'm thinking that she may not have wanted to bother OP. If someone is organizing an event and collecting RSVPs, that's the person to tell. I recently planned a party for my BF and people were reaching out to him with questions, RSVPs, etc and it was annoying to us both, since I was the point person. Maybe the friend was trying to be respectful and assumed that this info would be relayed (probably in bulk with other info) by the coordinator.", "No she's not doing any planning or helping with the wedding at all. I'm not sure exactly what the hen will be, my friend is organising it as a surprise. I don't mind her not being able to travel I just expected her to tell me if she can't come.", "No she's just dropped out. I'm assuming it's baby related but she didn't say.", "I don't really care what the reason is, even if someone just doesn't fancy it I think that's fine, but I expect her to let me know she's not coming.", "If you are an actual friend, you tell the person you can't make it. You don't have someone else tell the bride you can't make it", "She's not maid of honour because she couldn't help with the planning or any of that because of the baby. It was mutual and to benefit her. I'm not even calling the other bridesmaid maid of honour.", "Apparently she dropped out a month ago. I'm not saying anywhere the baby shouldnt come first, or that she has to come. I think its totally fair if she wants to stay with her child. I'm upset she hasn't text me herself to say she's not coming. I think it's really rude.", "I don't mind at all if people can't attend. I'm annoyed that she didn't text me to tell me she can't come.", ">Shoot off a text asking if she's attending and let her respond to you.\n\nI'd be absolutely pissed if any of my friends played that kind of game with me. She knows the friend isn't coming, there's absolutely no reason to play like that.", "I'm not sure. I think I've been as flexible around baby as possible when it comes to my wedding. I offered her to not do the bridesmaids thing if she didn't feel up to it, and baby is invited to the whole wedding too.", "Yeah, I find this the prevailing sentiment here to be extremely unrelatable to me.\n\nI had several people who couldn't make it to my bachelorette party, and none of them told me directly. They told my MoH, which I thought was the whole point of having some who kindly offers to plan it like she did -- so I don't have to handle that kind of logistics. \n\nOf course in a perfect world I would have liked to have them there, but I didn't feel any need whatsoever to receive a direct decline from them to me, or to interrogate their reasons.", "Exactly! She told the identified person. Why bother OP (who is probably busy and stressed planning a wedding) with it?", "OP and this woman have been friends for almost 20 years. OP was the MOH in her wedding and this friend would have been OP\u2019s MOH if she wasn\u2019t a new mom. They\u2019re close enough for this friend to tell OP what\u2019s going on directly. She just wanted to take the easy way out. Being a new parent isn\u2019t an excuse for discourtesy.", "They are the same. I added bachelorette because I didn't think everyone would know what a hen is.

IMO, the fact that it\u2019s a surprise and you don\u2019t know any details is critical information. Based on that, I\u2019d say NAH\n\nI was supposed to be a bridesmaid and was chewed out by the bride when I was trying to explain to her I didn\u2019t know if I could make it to the bachelorette party. I had just graduated from college, moved 8 hours away and wasn\u2019t able to afford it so I thought that by calling her to explain, it would be better. Turns out the whole thing was a surprise but it was NEVER told to me, not in messages/the invite/anywhere. In her mind showers/bachelorette parties were always a surprise and I should have known despite me having the opposite experience.", "How much notice did she give the other bridesmaid that she was dropping out? And did she know it wasn't a surprise bachelorette? Like we're you supposed to know everything that was happening and who was coming?", "I\u2019d give it a bit of time honestly. You might find she will message in the coming days / closer to the date to say sorry and explain. The baby probably isn\u2019t giving her much time to sit on her phone or compute much past eat, feed, sleep. \n\nIf a general guest did this, and messaged before the event (but not at the same time as rsvp\u2019ing no to the organiser) I\u2019d say that would be quite reasonable.\n\nBut agreed that it is a rude she hasn\u2019t contacted you yet when she\u2019s a bridesmaids and you put all the effort into hers.\n\nIt\u2019s understandable to be super upset she\u2019s not attending too. I would sleep on this, and contact her with an open mind, there may well be an aspect you don\u2019t know about. She may feel comfortable enough to come for a \u2018short period\u2019 of the event. \n\nThere are bridezilla out there who would expect their bridesmaids to be there pre-start to pass-finished, and all in, drunk etc. maybe she\u2019s worried about something like that?", "I recently was a best man and arranged the stag do (batchelor party) - no one responded to the stag / groom, everyone responded to me.\n\n(I actually did a survey of suitable dates, price ranges, length/format [eg could people do a weekend away or only during the daytime because of caring responsibilities], activities, etc - then presented the groom with a series of date and attendee combinations for him to pick which would be best - then I used the information about cost/length/activities to plan the event to enable as many people to come as possible [and to actually enjoy it - so making sure it didn\u2019t include things people were afraid of or physically restricted with])\n\nThe only question I had from the Groom was whether one person would actually be attending the stag do, as they had declined the wedding invite without providing a reason.", "That\u2019s good then. I would say you are NTA and the best thing to do is talk with her. Let her know that you heard she will not be coming and are a little upset that she will be missing this important event in your life and that you heard about it second-hand. I would approach it very gently and not be accusatory, there could be many good reasons, and it could just be a misunderstanding or miscommunication. With the other bridesmaid planning, did she ensure that the party would be something your best friend would be able to attend? Maybe it\u2019s as simple as her being told this is what we are doing and her saying \u201cI won\u2019t be able to do that\u201d or \u201cI won\u2019t be free on that day. Talk with her about it, there may be a reason that you to can work past if it is really important to you that she be there.", "NTA, but please keep an open mind until you talk to her.

Your friend did the right thing and told the hostess she was unable to attend.  (And it's nobody's business why).  The bride isn't the one who organises the bachelorette party and so she isn't the one you RSVP to.", "Don't be annoyed, be understanding. She probably knew dropping out would upset you and she's likely delayed telling you. Your life focus is your wedding. Hers is her baby.\n\nDon't text. Phone. Have a conversation.

Her reason for not attending might have to do with the surprise and she doesn't want to spoil it", "I'm thinking about what to say before getting in touch, that's why I wanted to check here if I'm being reasonable or not.", "In OPs defense they have been friends for a very long time. Yes she's not the hostess but a bridesmaid. It's not a surprise hen do. You at least text your good friend, the bride, and say \"hey can't make hen do. Just got a lot going on. I apologize for missing it\". I would do that for someone I barely knew, let alone a friend", "There's only one other bridesmaid though. Like will there be a single person at the party because no one told OP they actually hated her or what", "Yeah, I\u2019m thinking this is a situation where friend is nervous that her friends don\u2019t want her around because \u201cbaby is holding her back\u201d and she\u2019s afraid OP will be upset about it.\n*not saying OP is like this, just a thing I see often when people have kids, OP sounds understanding and just confused about their friend*", "what do you mean by \"call her out\"? like, publicly shame her in your friend group? absolutely yes you would be TA for that. not that serious.\n\nbut if you mean to just text her privately, then no you would not be TA. tell her you were hurt by it, and explain that she could've just told you herself. it takes 5 minutes to send a text to someone you've been friends with for 2 decades saying 'hey I'm really busy, can't come to the party sorry' ... she's 31, not 13. there's no reason for her to have other people communicate for her.", "NTA - The baby is 13 months, not a newborn. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s hard to leave the child, but this is not a last minute night out, plenty of time to arrange care. However, if she can\u2019t make it, she should be telling you, the bride, first.", "Info:  Did she say she was coming?  Was there an rsvp?", "Let me offer a counterpoint. Your other bridesmaid is the one arranging the event so I'm sure she's the one responsible for RSVPs. Your bridesmaid is simply following the standard protocol of informing the hostess that she won't be attending. You're not the hostess of the event. Please try not to take it personally but you can reach out to her yourself if you like and let her know how you feel. Just don't expect her to apologize since she did follow appropriate etiquette.", "I'm a bit confused here, because my understanding of hen dos is that, even if you know it's happening, it's traditional to treat it as a sort of \"surprise party\" thrown by the maid of honour. And if all the invitations are coming from the MOH (or whoever), the RSVPs should go to that person.\n\nSo, YTA to be confrontational with one of your best friends right before your big day. Seems like you're starting a fight over nothing that would needlessly make things uncomfortable between you two and possibly make her call into question if she is still welcome at the wedding.\n\nIf you value the two of you talking to each other, what's to stop *you* from texting *her* instead of sitting and stewing over it? Just send her a quick \"hey, X just told me you can't make it to the hen do, we'll miss you and hope everything is good with the baby!\" and she'll probably happily respond", "NTA. First of all, she could have had the courtesy to let you know that she was unable to attend.

Is she *doing* okay?", "Hen?  Boy, that's just asking for ridicule.\n\nSo have you reached out to her to express empathy, or is this just a transactional friendship?\n\nYou can show some class, then you don't need to worry about being an AH or not.", "NTA\n\nBut be careful with your words\n\nYes it was not nice to don't say anything and is alright to be sad but she has a baby and especially the first year is very extresful\n\nAnd the friend was passing a message form your friend or this is a rumor?\n\nTry get it straight with her to not have misunderstandings and explain your feelings", "INFO: Did she properly RSVP to the the other bridesmaid who is planning the party?

It's also shitty on her part considering all the effort you put into her hen do. I'm curious if this is a reflection your your friendship, you being the giver and her being the receiver. You're not at all being a bridzilla, it's understandable to feel some kinda way when a long term friend and bridesmaid flakes out on you and doesn't even give you the respect of letting you know she wont be attending. Poor form. I hope she does better at her bridesmaids duties on the day", "NAH based on the comments you\u2019ve given\n\nYour other bridesmaid has known for a month now that your friend isn\u2019t coming, yet didn\u2019t mention it until now? Your friend may have assumed the message would be passed along by now and may not have viewed it as a big deal since so much time passed with no one mentioning it \n\nYou clearly do view it as a big deal, and that\u2019s perfectly alright as well, if I was you I\u2019d have loved a heads up, but again your bridesmaid didn\u2019t mention it either. Send her a text asking why she can\u2019t make it tonight and that she\u2019ll be missed. She may have a good reason for not reaching out sooner", "LOL. You are friends with her for 20 years, but you are asking the internet whether you should talk to her?\n\nNTA. Instead of calling her out, maybe just call her and talk to her and listen to her side first.", "NTA expecting adults to communicate is the bare minimum. It\u2019s rude and tasteless how she\u2019s done it especially as she is literally a bridesmaid. Reach out to her and ask why you had tk find this out from someone else and explain your hurt that she wouldn\u2019t tell you herself.", "NTA. I'd probably reach out to her via text and say something like: \"Hey, I heard that you're not able to come to the bachelorette because of (child's name), which I completely understand. That being said, I'm a little disappointed I had to hear it through x, not you. You mean a lot to me and I always appreciate open lines of communication with you, even if it's not always news I want to hear. Let me know if you want to chat about this sometime soon.\"", "NTA. A text is not something that you can't have time to send, this looks more like \"I don't want to face you because I know I'm doing it wrong\" than \"I'm a busy mom I don't have time\". Also, there are many ways to be present and/or show you care (including texting \"I'm sad I can't be there for you like you've been for me\" )", "Especially shitty given that she is one of just two bridesmaids! At that point OP would probably be happier just altering the vibe of the do to make it doable for her friend", "[removed]", "She did though. She told the woman organizing the event she wasn\u2019t coming. We don\u2019t know how long ago it was but it could have been today. Gotta give people a bit of time.", "Yeah this is a good point. If it\u2019s not for a few month she may be planning to tell you and just told the organizers for planning purposes.", "No I mean call out something that upset my by telling her. Private one to one. I might have used tjr wrong words there.", "She told the woman organizing the event. Op just found out today give it till Monday imo.", "Last time we spoke she said she was coming. A month ago there was a deadline to pay a deposit for a booking (not sure what the booking was for) and she told my other bridesmaid she wasn't coming, so didn't send the money and isn't part of the booking.", "I\u2019m so shocked to see how many people don\u2019t understand this, every wedding party I\u2019ve attended this was the protocol. I also think it\u2019s strange that OP doesn\u2019t seem to be bothered by the fact that her other bridesmaid failed to mention one of her \u201cclosest friends\u201d wasn\u2019t attending until a month after she found out", "To be honest I resent the implication I talk about my wedding all the time. We've only had one full conversation about my wedding, where I said we'd work around her baby to make sure she's comfortable and everything was as flexible as possible. Other than that we haven't spoken about it. I don't go on about the wedding or ask for opinions on things. I ask how she is and how she's coping every time we speak. Every conversation is mostly about being a new mum. Wedding talk is rare.", "She isn't maid of honour because we had a big talk about if that would be too much pressure and she said it would be. I don't have a maid of honour.", "I'd have massively appreciated a message like this.", "I found out today and didn't want to talk when I was really annoyed.i wanted to see if my reaction was reasonable before reacting.", "The person organizing the event isn\u2019t the one who invited this woman to be a bridesmaid. OP is the bride. Her friend had a responsibility to inform the organizer as well as OP. According to OP, the friend dropped out a month ago so she had plenty of time to tell OP what\u2019s going on.", "Maybe she was trying to figure out the best way to tell you? It is obviously very important to you and maybe she was trying to figure out how to tell you. Then the hen party lady contacted her-and she didn't want the plans being made to get messed up by her cancelling later? Then life/baby/etc. distracted her before she could let you know what she told the hen party friend?\n\nHaving known someone who had very difficult postpartum depression, I'd reach out to your friend, open up the lines of communication, patch this up like friends do. She could be really struggling or is so swamped with a 13 month old baby she couldn't handle the hen party, being a bridesmaid, being your go-to friend during your wedding. That's a lot on a new mom's plate.\n\nCheck on your friend. Forgive her if you can-or else on your wedding day, you are going to be upset with your bridesmaid and that will hang over your special day.\n\nBest of luck!", "Or maybe that kid has some serious issues?", "You're right that rsvp-ing to the host was the right thing to do, but she ABSOLUTELY should have let her close friend of almost 20 years know, \"hey, I'm so sorry, I won't be able to make it to this for xxxx reason\".\n\nLike, I've been in this situation, and yes, I rsvp, but I still talk to my friend!", ">I'm not sure exactly what the hen will be, my friend is organising it as a surprise.\n\nThis is probably why she didn't reach out to you. She's trying to prevent spoiling anything for you. Not the best way to go about it but, I get it.", "Then sure, a quick text would have been nice.", "> I was told today by my friend arranging the hen do that Sarah isn't coming.\n\n...she let the organizer know.", "No she told the woman organizing the event first which is absolutely the correct move from a logistical standpoint.", "She told the person hosting the event she couldn\u2019t attend. That\u2019s kind of the entire point of having people in the wedding party plan and host, less stress for the bride/groom. You RSVP to the host, whether that means attending or not attending they are the person you inform", "My friend and I have known each-other since we were 14. You are not out of line for expecting some kind of acknowledgment of her absence.", "It's not a new baby though, the kid is over a year old. Get a sitter.", "\"Someone else\" is the hostess of the event, aka the person you're *supposed* to tell that you can't make it.", "I came here to ask if the whole party was supposed to be a surprise.\n\nOP, this is why she didn't tell you directly. She doesn't want to spill the beans and ruin it *for you*. She probably would have reached out after the fact. So no, don't call her out.", "Its slightly different on your situation tho. OP propably dont know the Whole questlist of her bachelorettes, but what she does know is the she has 2 bridesmaids. Bridesmaid(s)/bestman(s) are supposed to be present on all these wedding related events, so ofc op knows to expect both of them. Ops situations Is not about guest Who is not part of the wedding party", "But this is also her her close friend, who meant enough to be her maid of honor. The bridesmaid should\u2019ve at least sent a text.", "Agreed. She thinks the whole party is a surprise and doesn't want to ruin OPs party.OP, you have to reach out to her in this situation", "Surely OP would have provided the list of who to invite? People often have friends from different social groups so can\u2019t expect the best man / bridesmaids to know all of them and their contact details.\n\nI do think America has a different wedding culture than UK though (eg bigger wedding parties, rehearsal dinners, more costs on members of wedding parties)", "We don\u2019t know that friend isn\u2019t going to do\nThat though. Op just found out today give a few days.", "Apparently it actually is a surprise.", "What does this even mean? No one hates anyone and we have no idea how many people are invited to the party.", "It could have happened all very quickly. Give the woman a day or two.", "NTA regardless if its a good excuse or not she should at least tell you.", "INFO: when is the hen night? If it's still ages away, then she has time to tell you. If it's next week, she's rude.", "NTA We have Communication devices at our finger tips.", "You WNBTA. You have every right to expect some form of communication from her. Especially considering you planned and executed everything for her when she got married. You at least deserve to hear it from the horse's mouth, and you shouldn't have to ask.", "Could she actually be upset she\u2019s not your maid of honour but you were her maid of honour?", "NTA. You\u2019re not angry that she can\u2019t attend, you\u2019re hurt that she didn\u2019t do the bare minimum by telling her yourself.", "Nah NTA, though be mindful of the stress she's under when you approach it. This was a shitty friend move but be the better friend. \n\nTotally reasonable to feel let down that she didn't tell you directly though, especially when you two have basically traded roles on this.i can maaaaybe see it if it's just the hen do she's missing and she's still coming to the wedding. But still. Besties are supposed to be direct and we all have phones now so it's not like she'd have to wait for a visit", "You will be the AH if you \"call her out\" (because that means that you want to tell her off)....  why go that far? You don't even know why she didn't tell you herself yet.\n\nLater you say you want to tell her you are disappointed.  That's not the same as calling her out.  So instead, I would say:  avoid becoming an AH and just call and ask her if everything is OK with her.  Tell her you got worried when she dropped out without saying anything.  \n\nMaybe she didn't want to say anything because something is really wrong and she didn't want to load you with it at this happy time in your life.  You don't know what's going on with her.", "NTA, but please consider that you are still in fact getting the news secondhand. Yes, she should have contacted you; however you can call up your friend and ask if everything is alright, because you heard she couldn't come and you wanted to chat with her directly. There might be some nuance missing when the news was relayed to you.", "NTA, but don't go off the rails.  Your friend should have told you herself.  That said...  do you know fully what's going on?  Could be she's upset herself about disappointing you and didn't dare talk to you (a bit childish, but it happens).  Honestly, best thing to do is call her yourself and tell her hey, I heard you weren't able to come to the party, is everything alright, can I help somehow, etc etc.  How and what she says will tell you what is really happening here.  Don't assume until you find out.", "She's the AH, but you should contact her and talk to her, like an adult. If she's your friend, try to help her find a babysitter or something. Make it work.", "NTA. If it's true, she needs to tell you herself.", "INFO: did she see you and talk to you since she said this to the other bridesmaid?\n\nAre you sure she didn\u2019t think this other bridesmaid is a close enough friend to relay it until you two talk next? \n\nMaybe it happened to come up in the middle of planning, and could be friend happens to know before you did. It\u2019s not that your bff just wasn\u2019t meaning to talk to you herself at all. \n\nBreathe. I think a heartfelt talk means more than a text, and the next best person broke it to you for now.", "NAH. No one wants to detract from the positivity of wedding planning, IMO it's the MOH job to organise who can and can't come.and just tell the bride the score.\n\nAtleast I didn't expect people to apologise one on one to me for mine.", "Usually you tell the organizer", "All brides have some zilla in them.\n\nIt\u2019s not a Disney movie", "NTA I\u2019m a mum with a now 27m old\u2026. I still let people know directly if I can/can\u2019t make events - it\u2019s just courtesy - even if I say yes and then on the day I can\u2019t because something cropped up, it\u2019s just common decency \nAnd I\u2019m non confrontational so it\u2019s not like I hide behind that\u2026 it\u2019s easier to say \u201chey hun, so sorry but I can\u2019t come to ABC today cuz I was up all night and feel like shit, but I hope you have a blast and I\u2019m hoping to see you on DATE to give you a send off\u2026\u201d than it is to potentially ruin a friendship not saying anything and then living in horrible avoidance limbo", "you would be the asshole. you don't need to call her out. You can reach out to her with empathy, ask if she's doing ok. Start a calm and patient communication that allows her space to apologise or explain without her needing to be defensive or it escalating into a fight. She might have a really good reason why she didn't reach out. It doesn't need to be a confrontation and you can explain that you felt hurt by her lack of contact. Don't mention feeling resentment over the effort you made for her vs the effort she's made for you. It's not relevant, because the overall sentiment is that you wouldn't have felt hurt if she had communicated better with you.", "NTA\n\nYou have every right to tell Sarah that you are hurt that she did not reach out to you directly and that you understand that having a baby is difficult.", "NTA. She could have messaged you.", "NTA; it\u2019s just a basic courtesy to your friends to communicate like that. It\u2019s not that you\u2019re mad she\u2019s not coming, but that she couldn\u2019t be bothered to reach out to you directly.", "INFO: Is her baby having complications, or is she struggling with PPD? Those two things are very difficult and super hard to talk about, and she probably doesn\u2019t want you to stress out.\n\nAlso if baby will be over a year at the time\u2014thank her for the head\u2019s up. Maybe check in.\n\nEDIT: I had severe PPD with both my kids. Drudging up the energy to even tell people I was struggling was like climbing a mountain, and the amount of shit I got for struggling at all was ridiculous. PPD can also last up to 5 years after each kid so even at 13 months she\u2019s still possibly going to struggle.", "Maybe her reasoning is if she messages you to tell you it will stress you out and she's trying not to add stress to your wedding planning? Why not just ask and see what's up.", "NTA. That is terrible communication and, honestly, wildly disrespectful for someone who seems to be a best friend. I would probably reach out and say that you heard from the other bridesmaid that she isn\u2019t attending and that you\u2019re pretty disappointed and inquire to see if there is any specific reason that could be accommodated if you really want her there. Because that seems like the best course of action if there are just three wedding party members. That said, is the other person the maid of honour? And has your friendship changed or diminished since her marriage and motherhood? The fact that you were her maid of honour and reading between the lines it seems like the reverse is not true, is there a possibility of more complicated feelings perhaps being an undercurrent here?", "You don\u2019t even seem mad she could not attend but if I had been your maid of honor and you do t have the courage to apologize for not making it to my Face ID probably say something NTA", "If she's truly been a friend for that long she should have responded to you that she couldn't make the party since she's chasing around a 13 month old.

Sounds like a terrible friend to me.", "INFO Did you actually confirm this with her herself? Someone else telling you isn't a primary source. So maybe try a \"hey, are you still good for the bachelorette date?\" Then at least you'll know for sure either way.", "Did she say she was coming then not? If you never got confirmation it's on you. Maybe baby needs mama. Idk", "Glad some people read the post. It\u2019s about communication and respecting others by being upfront with them. Not having someone else do your dirty work cause you don\u2019t want to confront something head on. All OP is asking is for her friend to tell her directly. Imagine if no one told OP and she shows up thinking her friend will be there? That\u2019s super hurtful.", "Yep, she sounds like a lazy, self-centred excuse for a friend.
