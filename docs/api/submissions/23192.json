It\u2019s gross.", "NTA she should respect you and close the door. Sounds pretty simple if you ask me", "Her asshole is definitely the AH here", "NTA, if your wife is mad then that's pretty immature", "NTA. She's disrespectful for not following absolutely common courtesy and closing the bathroom door. Of course that's gross!\n\nI also laughed at \"fart alarm clock\" ... but I wouldn't be laughing if I had to deal with it. I'd be packing.", "NTA. Having to smell someone's shit is gross. It has nothing to do with being comfortable with each other. If she continues leaving the door open after you told her you don't like it then she's being disrespectful.", "NTA If her farting is so loud as to become a functional alarm clock, it's not an unreasonable ask for her to shut the door. Besides, who on earth takes a shit, especially a really loud & nasty one, with the bathroom door open? The only AHs here are OP's wife and the bell of her fart trumpet (aka the literal AH in this scenario).", "NTA but even if you were comfortable enough to poop in front of someone who thinks it\u2019s a good idea to wake someone up to that every morning?", "NTA its a reasonable request", "NTA. I have a stoma and it can be somewhat stinky on a morning.  I do always close the door anyway as I like my privacy (although don't mind what my husband sees) but he asks me to open the window once I've emptied it due to the smell. Im absolutely fine with this - bodily functions aren't supposed to smell nice and it's ok to request something like this as long as it's done kindly.", "NTA! Me and my husband leave the bathroom doors open often just to keep talking to each other BUT when he\u2019s sleeping, I close the door and stay respectful of that", "I'm sorry but I laughed \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude2d \n\nMaybe it's the food she's consuming?

If not then I don't see how this is helpful.", "I do disagree that OPs wife should be seen by a Dr. This is why I commented. You are spreading false information and if OPs wife followed your very incorrect advice it would be wasting an appointment that someone else would need. \n\nYou are wrong. You are spreading misinformation. I have EVERY right as someone with the illnesses you know nothing about other than a Google, to correct you.  And to correct you misinforming people and advising completely unnecessary medical appointments.", "No I am not spreading false information. You admitted yourself that being excessively gassy is a symptom. Stop trying to gatekeep. When is it ever a bad idea to see a Dr about symptoms.", "[removed]"]}
