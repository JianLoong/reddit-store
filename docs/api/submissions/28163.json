I'm literally never giving you a cent. At some point, I was willing to let you ask for favors, but you aren't asking, you are demanding, and I'm not doing that.

He's a criminal, and a stupid one, too, to get caught not only with the drug of his preference, but with a weapon, too. Your SIL is just plain stupid to play that \"but family!\" card once again after it did not work the last time. And she's trying to treat you as the \"my family\"-ATM, too. Did you even ever met him?
