He's not your brother, he is no relation to you. Plus $20K for someone that you don;t trust. Such a no brainer. Tell your sister in law that she needs therapy to treat her delusions and if she wants someone to post bail for her brother, she should do it since she's so worked up about it.\n\nSo, NTA here OP, but thank you for the best laugh I've had in awhile.", "I am praying that this is a joke or...I don't know, some sort of meta thing that I just don't get.\n\nIf this is real? NTA. So NTA that there's leftover there if you actually laughed at her on the phone and hung up. If my own brother got arrested for meth and gun possession, I wouldn't drive to the next town to bail him out for $10. Fly across country for someone you don't know? GTF out of here. That's insane.", "It sounds like she married your brother to have a connection to your bank account lol\n\nNTA. What a silly request. It\u2019s so outlandish to think you have to \u201cpay her back\u201d for refusing the first foolish request, let alone entertain the second one.", "NTA. Does your SIL really think her brother would be allowed to leave the State where he was hit with some fairly heavy criminal charges?  Something is wrong in the head with your brother\u2019s wife.", "NTA. His illegal choices are not your responsibility to assist.\n\nYes, 'family' helps when it's needed & deserved, but 'family' ALSO draws hard lines when said family are behaving in illegal/immoral/disgusting ways. Your SIL needs a serious, point blank discussion on how wrong she is to even suggest ANYONE bail out a meth dealer.\n\nAs if he were caught the very first time he dealt.", "I hope you laughed really, really hard at this suggestion.  NTA.", "Is she for real? Like seriously.\n\nHey you would not pay for my wedding, but you can make it up to me by bailing out my brother. JUST WTF????\n\nShe needs major help with entitlement. \n\nNTA NTA NTA", "I remember that post about your step niece's wedding.  How on earth did your SIL come to believe you were the family ATM?  And you know if you posted the $20k bail, he'd skip and that money is gone.  NTA and I'm really happy you are standing firm.", "You're just in this for the karma points, right?

No means no and she can sit and spin!", "Your SIL\u2019s brother is not your family. NTA", "OH So NTA!!\n\nI remember that post about the wedding, and you have absolutely NOTHING to make up for!\n\nAdditionally, its not your responsibility to bail anyone out of jail, much less someone who has been arrested for dealing drugs like crystal meth! The likelihood that you would lose the bail money because he doesnt show, is very high, so essentially your SIL wants you to GIVE him $20k, when he isnt even family.\n\nNope Nope and quadruple NOPE!", "NTA - Just stay away/ignore these people. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Her brother was arrested for dealing crystal meth and weapons possession. \n\nHe can sit in the hoosegow as long as possible and think about what he's done.", "NTA\n\nIf she wants to get him Bail she needs to do it herself", "You are NTA.  Your SIL is an entitled piece of work.  Where in any sane place on this planet does she think that you would want to lift one finger or pay even 1 cent towards helping her criminal brother who is in no way related to you except distantly by marriage.", "This is hilarious.", "NTA\n\nWhere does she get off? Don\u2019t even give this woman a penny. She will then ask you to tip her urologist for pulverizing her kidney stones.", "wow.  she's got some balls.  also, why in god's name would she want the likes of him to be back on the streets with that charge?  lord.  tell her to start a go fund me, see how that goes.  lol.  NTA.", "NTA, not your problem, they crapped in their bed & they can sleep in it, drug dealers belong in jail.", "Sounds like her brother is exactly where he should be. NTA", "NTA- and I would start with \"He's not my family\".  Everybody is related to sombody who is married to somebody who is related to somebody and so forth... by her standard, we're all just one big happy family.  You are free to draw that line wherever you want.  \n\nAnother way to respond to that is by saying, \"family?  huh, I don't ever remember getting a christmas or birthday card from that guy, nope, he's not MY family\"  and then I'd would add, and as for making up for paying for the wedding? um, nope, that was never my thing either, nothing to make up for there.  so, yeah, no obligation.  \n\nSo, let's be clear- this bit where you try to obligate and berate me into shelling out thousands of dollars on your account is over. I'm literally never giving you a cent. At some point, I was willing to let you ask for favors, but you aren't asking, you are demanding, and I'm not doing that.  In fact, if you don't stop, I'll slap you with a restraining order. Maybe it will stick, maybe it won't but you can start spending legal fees fighting it. And that will just be the beginning. Leave me the fuck out of your bullshit.", "NTA, he's no relation to you and if he couldn't do the time, he shouldn't have done the crime. You would be on the hook for the full amount of the bond if he skipped out on his trial. That would be a hard NO for most people. You also have nothing to make up to the SIL for. Let her be pissed, she'll either get over it or she won't. Hopefully she will eventually see the error of her ways, but don't count on it.", "NTA he is your brother's in law not yours.", "NTA. Ask her why in the flying F\u2014\u2014 do you owe her a single thing? Then tell her to get bent after whatever stupid thing she says next.", "NTA\n\nIf you can\u2019t pay the penalty, don\u2019t do the crime. He knew the risk when he decided to sell meth and carry a weapon.", "NTA. Why do you even ask? He's a criminal, and a stupid one, too, to get caught not only with the drug of his preference, but with a weapon, too. Your SIL is just plain stupid to play that \"but family!\" card once again after it did not work the last time. And she's trying to treat you as the \"my family\"-ATM, too. Did you even ever met him? Were you close to him? How is he your family if the answer to both questions would be \"No, f no!\"?\n\nSIL might find herself out of the family if she keeps up with her spiel.", "Nta\n\nMeth and weapons, I'd actually pay to *keep* him in jail.", "WOW...you SIL is rally a huge dick!  And very, very stupid.", "NTA she\u2019s not treating you like family, she\u2019s treating you like a piggy bank.", "You're NTA.
