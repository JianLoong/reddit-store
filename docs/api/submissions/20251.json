{"id": 20251, "submission_id": "14fdzf3", "title": "AITA for preferring an adult trip over one for kids?", "selftext": "My (30m) gf \"Tera\" (29f) works in healthcare and makes about 6 figures a year. She has been saving a little bit of money out of each paycheck since she started working at 15 for what she decided would be her \"stupid money\" - essentially money that she couldn't spend on anything practical and had to be something fun. The rule she set was she had to spend the money when she was 30. I know all this because she has brought it up pretty often over the 3 years we have been together.\n\nHonestly, I have been excited to see what she would do with all the money she has saved. Today, she came over and told me she had something exciting to tell me. She had decided what to do with her \"stupid money\". The grand plan she had come up with was a Disney trip. Which, initially, I was like \"ok, whatever, her family lived near Disney World when she was growing up, I can understand her wanting to use some of the money for a few days there\".\n\nBut she wasn't talking about just going to Disney World. Her grand plan for spending the money she's been saving for almost 15 years, was to do all the Disneylands in the world. Tokyo, California, Paris, and apparently there's one or two in China as well. She asked me what I thought, and I had to be honest, so the conversation went something like this:\n\n\"That sounds like a trip a 7 year old would plan, do you seriously want to waste your money on that?\"\n\n\"What do you mean, it would be so fun!\"\n\n\"For a 7 year old. You could spend part of your money on a trip to Disney World or whatever, but I would really rather be going somewhere that was for adults and actually had some kind of culture.\"\n\n\"Well, we wouldn't just be going to the parks, we would spend a few days in each of the cities too.\"\n\nI then had to tell her how that made no sense. Take Tokyo for example, she was planning on spending three days in the Disney park and four days in Tokyo proper. One of the greatest cities in the world, and she wanted to waste almost half her time in an overpriced theme park?\n\nWe argued back and forth for a while, and she ended up leaving. She called me a few hours ago to tell me that if I didn't want to go, she was going to take her sister as a HS graduation present, but that I was being an AH about the trip she had planned for us. I feel like she may be the AH for trying to take back taking me on a trip, but I may be the AH for being honest and telling her I thought her idea was kind of ridiculous for an adult.\n\nEdit: Wanted to clear up some confusion I was seeing, although it seems I will be labeled the AH no matter what at this point.\n\nAbout work/time off: I work \\~6 months of the year and technically have the rest of the year off, although I typically choose to work from home part time during those months, which I could do from any country as it isn't location/time dependent. So, taking the time off would not have been an issue for me. As for Tera, she is allowed to take off pretty much as long as she wants so long as it is scheduled with her hospital long enough in advance. It does not count as PTO, so she would not be receiving pay and if she isn't receiving pay, they don't care.\n\nTera being a Disney Adult: I wasn't really familiar with this term before this, to be honest. As far as I know, she wouldn't be classified as one. She hasn't been to Disney World in something like four years, and while we both watch the occasional Disney movie or TV show, I wouldn't say she is obsessed to the level of what a Disney adult apparently is.\n\nCost: She was going to cover 100% of the cost of air, travel, wifi, hotels, food, and entertainment. I was only going to pay for incidentals like souvenirs.

If you don't want to go, don't go. But it's a AH move to argue about what she wants to do. Also, have you not heard of Disney Adults. Plenty of adults LOVE going to Disney, lol.

You may not understand her obsession with Disney (I don\u2019t either but it\u2019s not hurting anyone), maybe it\u2019s part of healing her inner child that didn\u2019t get the things she wanted when she was a child (did ya think about that?). Third, you sound like a snob \u201c\u2026had some kind of culture.\u201d, I like museums, and art, and historical sites too, but I also like to have fun and Disney has rides and games and so much going on.

You don't have to go but you also don't have a place to be so picky about a vacation your not even paying for. Major YTA esit to add.

Why would she take someone on a long, expensive trip if they don't want to go on it?\n\nListen, that's not my dream trip, and not even a trip I would want to go on...maybe a free trip though. You can absolutely decline to go, and your reasoning of wanting to go on a trip that was more \"adult\" or about seeing various landmarks/cities would be a fine thing to do. You would have to take off work and pay for things, so you don't have to go on any trip you don't want to go on. \n\nBut saying the trip is childish and silly is just rude. You can not be interested, but you don't need to act like a child yourself and use insults. It isn't something you are excited for, but it isn't childish or silly, and I don't ever want to go to Disney again in my life. \n\nSo you put her down and were rude, made it clear you thought the trip was \"silly\" and for a \"7 year old\" but you still think you get to go on this trip?

She has been saving a little bit of money out of each paycheck since she started working at 15 for what she decided would be her \"stupid money\" - essentially money that she couldn't spend on anything practical and had to be something fun. The rule she set was she had to spend the money when she was 30. I know all this because she has brought it up pretty often over the 3 years we have been together.\n\nHonestly, I have been excited to see what she would do with all the money she has saved. Today, she came over and told me she had something exciting to tell me. She had decided what to do with her \"stupid money\". The grand plan she had come up with was a Disney trip. Which, initially, I was like \"ok, whatever, her family lived near Disney World when she was growing up, I can understand her wanting to use some of the money for a few days there\".\n\nBut she wasn't talking about just going to Disney World. Her grand plan for spending the money she's been saving for almost 15 years, was to do all the Disneylands in the world. Tokyo, California, Paris, and apparently there's one or two in China as well. She asked me what I thought, and I had to be honest, so the conversation went something like this:\n\n\"That sounds like a trip a 7 year old would plan, do you seriously want to waste your money on that?\"\n\n\"What do you mean, it would be so fun!\"\n\n\"For a 7 year old. You could spend part of your money on a trip to Disney World or whatever, but I would really rather be going somewhere that was for adults and actually had some kind of culture.\"\n\n\"Well, we wouldn't just be going to the parks, we would spend a few days in each of the cities too.\"\n\nI then had to tell her how that made no sense. Take Tokyo for example, she was planning on spending three days in the Disney park and four days in Tokyo proper. One of the greatest cities in the world, and she wanted to waste almost half her time in an overpriced theme park?\n\nWe argued back and forth for a while, and she ended up leaving. She called me a few hours ago to tell me that if I didn't want to go, she was going to take her sister as a HS graduation present. I feel like she may be the AH for trying to take back taking me on a trip, but I may be the AH for being honest and telling her I thought her idea was kind of ridiculous for an adult.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The fact she was gonna bring you was already wild, that\u2019s her money!", "dude, that would be an amazing trip", "Wow, you're not an asshole. You're a bonified piece of sh*t \n\nI couldn't imagine spending 15 years working hard and saving bits of money to one day do something awesome for myself and then throwing it away for a f*cking guy I've been with for less than a third of the time I've been saving.\n\nI genuinely hope she sticks to her word.\n\nHow devastating it would be to know you spent 15 years of your life working towards something and not getting it because you allowed yourself to take a backseat.\n\n15 years from now, you may not even be together (hell, she may come back and dump your ass), and you want her to put her joy on hold? For you? \n\nLook at the bigger picture here. This is her money, her time spent to get it, and her ideal trip. You've already ruined it, man. Even if she goes without you, this will sour the experience. \n\nHow are you really going to feel if it goes with you? I bet you'd be pissed. Since in your eyes this is YOUR trip.\n\nMy husband has different interests as me, if he came to me excited about something, something I know he's worked hard and long for, and it wasn't my cup of tea, I'd f*cking grin and bare it. FOR HIM.\n\nI just can't get over this. You call her a 7 year old? Do 7 year olds save money for 15 years and plan trips that span across different countries? Do they hold jobs at 6 figure salaries?\n\nNah, 7 year olds whine and b*tch when they don't get what they want or don't like something. \n\nSo, who's the damn 7 year old?\n\nEdit: spelling", "INFO: You said you were excited to see what she would spend the money on.

It's the way you speak. Look, I wouldn't burn my money on a Disney (around the) World trip either, but it's not my money now, is it? It's okay that you would rather do something different, but any possible chance you had of changing her mind or maybe getting to a compromise on what you guys will be doing went down the drain the moment you called her a child.

If she is surprised that her plan looks childish to most functioning adults, she must be really naive.\n\nUltimately, Disney adults need to find other Disney adults to be with because it's a fundamental incompatibility otherwise.

The only Disney park in Florida that doesn't have free-flowing alcohol is the Magic Kingdom; you can only get beer at table service restaurants there, nothing to-go from a counter (it's their most family-focused park, and it used to be the one totally dry park before they started at least serving beer). \n\nI'm not as sure about the booze situation in the Asian parks, but I can tell you alcohol was easy to come by in Disneyland Paris (though I didn't find the bars there to be anything to write home about).

This is only 1 thing that they have done, look up other disney scandals and you'll quickly realize the company is pretty much evil, so to me giving 1000s of dollars to a company that doesnt care about people being put in concentration camps isnt a good look for a person, i give some leeway if you have young kids that really want to go, but if you are an adult at disney without a kid it is pathetic", "I think you need to learn to read.
