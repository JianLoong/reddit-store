She has been saving a little bit of money out of each paycheck since she started working at 15 for what she decided would be her \"stupid money\" - essentially money that she couldn't spend on anything practical and had to be something fun. The rule she set was she had to spend the money when she was 30. I know all this because she has brought it up pretty often over the 3 years we have been together.\n\nHonestly, I have been excited to see what she would do with all the money she has saved. Today, she came over and told me she had something exciting to tell me. She had decided what to do with her \"stupid money\". The grand plan she had come up with was a Disney trip. Which, initially, I was like \"ok, whatever, her family lived near Disney World when she was growing up, I can understand her wanting to use some of the money for a few days there\".\n\nBut she wasn't talking about just going to Disney World. Her grand plan for spending the money she's been saving for almost 15 years, was to do all the Disneylands in the world. Tokyo, California, Paris, and apparently there's one or two in China as well. She asked me what I thought, and I had to be honest, so the conversation went something like this:\n\n\"That sounds like a trip a 7 year old would plan, do you seriously want to waste your money on that?\"\n\n\"What do you mean, it would be so fun!\"\n\n\"For a 7 year old. You could spend part of your money on a trip to Disney World or whatever, but I would really rather be going somewhere that was for adults and actually had some kind of culture.\"\n\n\"Well, we wouldn't just be going to the parks, we would spend a few days in each of the cities too.\"\n\nI then had to tell her how that made no sense. Take Tokyo for example, she was planning on spending three days in the Disney park and four days in Tokyo proper. One of the greatest cities in the world, and she wanted to waste almost half her time in an overpriced theme park?\n\nWe argued back and forth for a while, and she ended up leaving. She called me a few hours ago to tell me that if I didn't want to go, she was going to take her sister as a HS graduation present, but that I was being an AH about the trip she had planned for us. I feel like she may be the AH for trying to take back taking me on a trip, but I may be the AH for being honest and telling her I thought her idea was kind of ridiculous for an adult.", "created_utc": 1687368706, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14fdzf3/aita_for_preferring_an_adult_trip_over_one_for/", "score": 221, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you don't want to go, don't go. But it's a AH move to argue about what she wants to do. Also, have you not heard of Disney Adults. Plenty of adults LOVE going to Disney, lol. Maybe compromise and go to one of the cities with her and then she can take her sisters to the other ones.", "yta yikes", "YTA. It\u2019s her money.

She been saving for years for a trip for HER, what she wants to do. It's fine if you don't like Disney but there are hours of activities for adults and I'm not even thinking of rides.

I'm honestly amazed at how mean you are.\n\nit's one thing to be uninterested in the trip she's planning. it's another to insult her and pitch a fit because you want the free globe-trotting trip she's offering you to be tailored to your wishes, when she's spent half her life saving up for this.", "So you were excited to see how 15 years of saving to splurge on herself would benefit you? The only person acting like a 7 year old here is you. I'm glad your gf (hopefully soon to be ex gf) is taking her sister.

You are being invited on a journey around the world and you decide to focus on the negatives.  You insulted her and completely crushed her life time plan.

Way to stomp her dream and joy!...", "YTA I\u2019m a young adult and think that\u2019s sounds awesome. I\u2019d be way more interested in Disneyland Tokyo than seeing actual Tokyo.

You want her to sponsor YOU for a trip tailored to YOUR needs and pay for it with her hard earned & saved money.

This trip isn't about you, you haven't saved any money towards it, and honestly your girlfriend was being incredibly kind to invite you as her guest.\n\nSo you think Disney parks are childish - you don't have to vacation there!

It doesn't matter because this is HER dream vacation.\n\nDid you really expect her to say, \"You're right, why don't we plan the trip you would approve of, with the money I have been working half my life to accumulate?!\"\n\nYou sound entitled and pretentious, and I bet you are just a joy at parties.", "YTA, you could have politely declined. I\u2019m not sure why you\u2019re so judgmental over what an adult does with their own money. I\u2019m not a Disney adult either, but I wouldn\u2019t trash someone and call it \u201cwasting money\u201d, especially when they intend to share those experiences with you.

She is not obligated to take you. You dont like the sound of the trip, prefect dont go. Problem solved.", "YTA. Polite refusal is a virtue.", "YTA.

In your Tokyo example, does it really matter what she wants to do with her money and time?

Has it ever occured to you that she planned this trip the way she did because that is what she would genuinely enjoy? You shared your honest opinion, fine, but who TF cares when the trip is not about you? Not even for you. You should be grateful she wanted to take you with her at all. But if it's not something you would enjoy, just say that, but don't belittle your girlfriend's interests just because you think you're too cool to enjoy disney.

Second, you don\u2019t get to say what a \u201ckid\u201d or \u201cadult\u201d trip is. You may not understand her obsession with Disney (I don\u2019t either but it\u2019s not hurting anyone), maybe it\u2019s part of healing her inner child that didn\u2019t get the things she wanted when she was a child (did ya think about that?). Third, you sound like a snob \u201c\u2026had some kind of culture.\u201d, I like museums, and art, and historical sites too, but I also like to have fun and Disney has rides and games and so much going on.

She will have way more fun with her sister.", "YTA. It's the money she saved and something she was excited about and you put it down. You don't have to agree to go on the whole thing, you don't have to think it's a great use of money. It's her fun money - you don't get to decide for her!

You don't have to go but you also don't have a place to be so picky about a vacation your not even paying for. Major YTA esit to add.

Why would she take someone on a long, expensive trip if they don't want to go on it?\n\nListen, that's not my dream trip, and not even a trip I would want to go on...maybe a free trip though. You can absolutely decline to go, and your reasoning of wanting to go on a trip that was more \"adult\" or about seeing various landmarks/cities would be a fine thing to do. You would have to take off work and pay for things, so you don't have to go on any trip you don't want to go on. \n\nBut saying the trip is childish and silly is just rude.

It isn't something you are excited for, but it isn't childish or silly, and I don't ever want to go to Disney again in my life. \n\nSo you put her down and were rude, made it clear you thought the trip was \"silly\" and for a \"7 year old\" but you still think you get to go on this trip? That is what makes you the biggest AH.

She has been saving a little bit of money out of each paycheck since she started working at 15 for what she decided would be her \"stupid money\" - essentially money that she couldn't spend on anything practical and had to be something fun. The rule she set was she had to spend the money when she was 30. I know all this because she has brought it up pretty often over the 3 years we have been together.\n\nHonestly, I have been excited to see what she would do with all the money she has saved. Today, she came over and told me she had something exciting to tell me. She had decided what to do with her \"stupid money\". The grand plan she had come up with was a Disney trip. Which, initially, I was like \"ok, whatever, her family lived near Disney World when she was growing up, I can understand her wanting to use some of the money for a few days there\".\n\nBut she wasn't talking about just going to Disney World. Her grand plan for spending the money she's been saving for almost 15 years, was to do all the Disneylands in the world. Tokyo, California, Paris, and apparently there's one or two in China as well. She asked me what I thought, and I had to be honest, so the conversation went something like this:\n\n\"That sounds like a trip a 7 year old would plan, do you seriously want to waste your money on that?\"\n\n\"What do you mean, it would be so fun!\"\n\n\"For a 7 year old. You could spend part of your money on a trip to Disney World or whatever, but I would really rather be going somewhere that was for adults and actually had some kind of culture.\"\n\n\"Well, we wouldn't just be going to the parks, we would spend a few days in each of the cities too.\"\n\nI then had to tell her how that made no sense. Take Tokyo for example, she was planning on spending three days in the Disney park and four days in Tokyo proper. One of the greatest cities in the world, and she wanted to waste almost half her time in an overpriced theme park?\n\nWe argued back and forth for a while, and she ended up leaving. She called me a few hours ago to tell me that if I didn't want to go, she was going to take her sister as a HS graduation present. I feel like she may be the AH for trying to take back taking me on a trip, but I may be the AH for being honest and telling her I thought her idea was kind of ridiculous for an adult.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The fact she was gonna bring you was already wild, that\u2019s her money!", "dude, that would be an amazing trip", "Wow, you're not an asshole.

For you? \n\nLook at the bigger picture here. This is her money, her time spent to get it, and her ideal trip. You've already ruined it, man. Even if she goes without you, this will sour the experience. \n\nHow are you really going to feel if it goes with you? I bet you'd be pissed. Since in your eyes this is YOUR trip.\n\nMy husband has different interests as me, if he came to me excited about something, something I know he's worked hard and long for, and it wasn't my cup of tea, I'd f*cking grin and bare it.

Do they hold jobs at 6 figure salaries?\n\nNah, 7 year olds whine and b*tch when they don't get what they want or don't like something. \n\nSo, who's the damn 7 year old?\n\nEdit: spelling", "INFO: You said you were excited to see what she would spend the money on.

It's okay that you would rather do something different, but any possible chance you had of changing her mind or maybe getting to a compromise on what you guys will be doing went down the drain the moment you called her a child.

It would be an asshole move to pretend to be excited and then have a bad time on the trip or be embarrassed being in her pictures. There's no reason for her to be mad. She can just go with someone else without making it an issue. If she is surprised that her plan looks childish to most functioning adults, she must be really naive.\n\nUltimately, Disney adults need to find other Disney adults to be with because it's a fundamental incompatibility otherwise.

Tourist attractions and experiences developed to drive visits can still be unique and unlike what you could do back home or anywhere else. \n\nI'm sure plenty of the things OP thinks are exciting about these cities are also tourist attractions or in some way catering to foreigners.

And to a Disney fan, they're really not all the same; I won't get into details but every property has a different vibe as well as different attractions. \n\nI had a family friend whose personal goal was to visit every Hard Rock Cafe in the world and buy a mug from each and every one of them.

They've got regular bars with the usual stuff, but also internationally themed bars in the World Showcase at Epcot, a tiki bar with special effects at the Polynesian Resort, a Star Wars-themed cantina in the Hollywood Studios park...the list goes on and on and on, and a fair few of them have special cocktails invented for each location. Disneyland out in California has at least some of the same kinds of things, though I have less experience with that. The only Disney park in Florida that doesn't have free-flowing alcohol is the Magic Kingdom; you can only get beer at table service restaurants there, nothing to-go from a counter (it's their most family-focused park, and it used to be the one totally dry park before they started at least serving beer). \n\nI'm not as sure about the booze situation in the Asian parks, but I can tell you alcohol was easy to come by in Disneyland Paris (though I didn't find the bars there to be anything to write home about). I mean...it's France. There's going to be alcohol. \n\nNo offense to you, but when I see people asking questions like \"does Disney serve alcohol?\" it jars me into having to actually understand why people like OP think of Disney as a kids' destination inappropriate for adults. There's tons of stuff on Disney property that's designed to appeal to adults; it's just that a lot of adults who go to Disney solely to placate their children never look into any of it because they assume they're just there to put up with having a bad time while their kids have fun.", "I think Florida doesn\u2019t but others do?", ">Does Disney sell alcohol?  \n   \nYes, they most certainly do.
