I had my first relationship a few months ago, but he broke up with me over text during my reading week in early October.\n\nObviously I was really heartbroken, but that\u2019s not what I\u2019m here to talk about. The morning after he broke up with me, my mom decided to go through my phone and read my texts. She found out I had a boyfriend and BOY was she mad.

I came home for the holidays/winter break and\u2026 my mom didn\u2019t let me leave the house since I came home. I couldn\u2019t hangout with any of my friends. I couldn\u2019t even take a walk outside. She\u2019s now letting me leave the house and hangout with my friends now that the new year has started\u2026. but I\u2019m still obviously upset.

After finding out about my boyfriend, my mother was very upset that I betrayed her trust and went behind her back. This may make me the asshole because I was a liar who went behind my parents.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcements\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
