Her and I used to be friends in highschool but she started bullying me after my ex at the time spread my nudes around the school. I'm hurt that my brother is marrying her but I've chosen not to care.\n\nWhen I was 18, I was disowned. I've suffered with mental health issues from childhood (autism, ADHD and Bipolar 2) and received no support from family. I turned to shitty boyfriends for support. After the incident I mentioned in the first paragraph, I made a series of bad choices that led me to date a drug dealer and get hooked. My parents found out, put me through rehab and then kicked me out. I'm grateful for them getting me clean but there's a lot of trauma there and it's obvious they never want to see me again.\n\nWhen I turned 19, I got a job as an air hostess. This is when I reconnected with my brother. My family is well off and he felt bad for me being cut off, so he started paying my rent. We kept in contact and became as close as we were as kids again.\n\nHe asked me to be his best woman at his wedding. He knew I was nervous about being around the family again but he reduced my duties as best woman so I wouldn't have to deal with them because they still talk badly about me and hate me. His fianc\u00e9e was infuriated at me being best woman because of my reputation in the town but he told her that he wanted me there. Then, I found myself added to her bridal party group chat which contains a lot of the girls that bullied me in highschool. I was confused at first but I thought that as long as everyone was going to be mature, I was cool with it. \n\nThis isnt what happened and it became obvious that they were still acting like we were in highschool. So far, she's invited me to two bridal party events that caused me to reschedule shifts, only for her to have 'accidentally' gotten the date wrong. After that, I left the GC. I didn't tell my brother about this because I don't wanna cause issues with the couple before their wedding and I know my presence at the wedding is already unwanted by everyone but him. They've also talked trash about me and mocked me in person.\n\nLast weekend was the rehearsal dinner and I was accosted by the maid of honor, who is also an ex-friend. She demanded to know why I had left the group and I lied and said it was because my phone was low on storage. That led to a massive argument where she demanded that I rejoin the GC because traditionally, all women involved in the wedding are in the bridal party and since I'm not even heavily involved with the grooms party, that meant SIL was 'in charge of me' and that she had to pick my dress and make up which isn't what my brother said. I refused to rejoin it.\n\nNow, my SIL and brother are fighting and she wants me uninvited from the wedding. He said that I don't have to rejoin the group. SIL is calling me an asshole for making them fight over this.

I\u2019d also wager it would benefit your reputation within the family as well (again if this is something you desire).", "First, congrats on getting clean.\n\nSecond, if I take you at face value from what you\u2019ve written it\u2019s NTA but I\u2019m getting the feeling from missing details that there is a potential that you may have started things by reading into intentions due to your past history with the other members of the bridal party. \n\nIt sounds like the source of the drama was you leaving the group chat and you left because you felt people were intentionally wasting your time when there are a lot of reasons dates can get mixed up or changed, especially given all the moving wheels involved in wedding planning.\n\nIt\u2019s possible you have not moved on from high school anymore than these other girls. It doesn\u2019t help that you are pointlessly lying to the others (and obviously) and people don\u2019t like being lied to their face. \n\nBut all the same you are part of the grooms side and you don\u2019t need to be looped into the going ons of the bride\u2019s side (especially if you two don\u2019t have a good relationship). She\u2019s overreacting and should let you take a more minimal role if you\u2019d like. I was a best man and pretty much just showed up, accepted my picked out clothes, stood up there, and gave a speech. You didn\u2019t ask to be a wedding planner and shouldn\u2019t be forced to be buddy buddy with them.", "Great take! OP would do a huge favor to the brother in the long run. Think about future kids they might have.", "This. OP, tell him everything factually. Let him decide what to do with the information. But, he SHOULD know who he's marrying, so he won't be surprised later.", ">Sounds like future SIL is a real piece of work who will make your brother miserable.\n\nI thought so too but they're actually total love birds. I think she's only nice to him or smth \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\ude2d", "She's nice to him now. Does not mean that it will stay that way. Especially if she is hiding the bullying part of herself from him. Eventually she may decide she's safe from repercussions and start showing all of her nature to him.\n\nBetter that he know what is really going on sooner rather than later.\n\nPlus, once they're married, do you think she will hesitate to either continue terrorizing you or start trying to drive a wedge between you and your brother?", "What if she abuses their kid because it's not the right gender? Or him because now he's LOCKED down in marriage."]}
