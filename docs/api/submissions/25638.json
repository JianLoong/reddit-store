My entire point, which many of you seem to have missed, or simply disregarded is snapping to the point of hurling obscenities at children. Regardless of how they are behaving, a fully grown adult stopping to the maturity level of a 10-12 year old and cussing out children is not excusable. \n\nSomeone said \"well they started it\". That just highlights my point. Kids also punch, kick, and bite. That does not make it acceptable to punch, kick, or bite them back. \n\nI completely understand OPs frustrations. I've been there. We all have. But not once have I stooped to the level of cussing out children. That is an asshole move regardless. \n\nMaybe it would be different if this was left to OP and the Mom only. But an adult cussing out kids is not excusable. \n\nOriginal:\nY. T.  A.  - so your (understandable) reaction is to start hurling obscenities at children? Instead of being, you know, and adult and going to fetch a theater employee to deal with them (that is their job, you know). \n\nI do side with you, I've been there and it super aggravating when people don't control their kids in places like that, but whether justified or now your reaction still makes you an asshole.\n\nThere is staff SOMEWHERE.

He loved Star Trek as much as I did. Because I would rock him to sleep in the evening while we watched our VHS recordings of the Original Series.  We had to try two theaters because the first one refused to allow me in with a child under 3.  \n\nWe sat there, little guy on my lap, and as the lights went down, and the Music came up, he looked at me and said,\" KirSpokBones !!!\"  He watched at least half before falling asleep.", "Also imo, The Wind Rises is not a children's movie, even if Studio Ghibli is", "You can't control them, but you can teach them to behave properly, and if they don't, then you make them leave so others can enjoy the movie.", "Parents CAN control how long their kids behave like this in a theater, by taking them out of the theater when they behave like this.\n\nThey might continue to behave like this, but it won't be in a theater.", ">Nobody \u201ccan control\u201d anyone. But the parents should educate the kids or go home.\n\nPhysically removing them from the theater would be controlling and perfectly acceptable to this parent.", "Every other person in that theater was so thank for you. Every single one. You did the difficult thing everyone wanted done.", "No, why doesn't she control her children?  They aren't allowing you to have this \"peace\" she's trying to claim!\n\nI swear, no one knows how to behave in public anymore.  Someone was vaping next to me on the subway the other day and acting like I was the crazy person for objecting to it and moving away - luckily there were other seats I could move to.", "I'd love to show them grave of the fireflies.  I was not prepared for how devastating that studio ghibli was.  And I'm in my 30s", "Yeah I tried showing spirited away to my young nephews, that did *not* go well - I mean as a horror movie fan, even I found it a bit scary as a teenager, they most definitely are not kids' movies.\n\nAnd most importantly, beyond the monsters and scary creatures in some of them, many deal with very difficult and complex issues/stories that would be hard for a kid to handle mentally and emotionally - like the Grave of the Fireflies.", "Ah ok I see. Btw do you guys actually call it 'Crimson Pig' instead of 'Porco Rosso' in the US?", "No. The movie plays in its entirety. Every movie. And has done so probably forty years now", "Because he doesn\u2019t get to complain about the value of his ticket being wasted when all he did was make as much noise as he says the kids were. And he says this went on for over an hour before he spoke directly to the kids. Talking to the mom had changed nothing so yelling at the kids wasn\u2019t going to work any better. OP sounds about 12 years old himself. He\u2019s the asshole for not acting like an adult and dealing with the situation in a way that actually put a stop to it. And also because the whole story is horse shit.", "So... children also punch, kick, and bite. Are you suggesting that makes it ok to punch, kick, and bite children in return?", "Doesn't matter what happened before. When you fall to the level of yelling obscenities at children you've lost. Full stop. OP is an adult and can use adult control. OP failed to do so and failing to understand that point is a huge part of the problem here.", "I get that. And my point was that you did snap and ended up hurling obscenities at children. Yeah, they and their mom were total assholes, but that doesn't absolve you of your own behavior even if pushed to that point by disrespectful kids. Falling to the point of cussing out children is why I said YTA. I feel for you in every way but that.", "That part I\u2019m out of my depth, but you definitely have to do some research as a parent (or, at least, I do because I\u2019m a dad and a librarian).", "That\u2019s a perfect paraphrase of my comment.", "That\u2019s a perfect paraphrase of my comment.", "No I'm actually Italian ahah, I just thought the name would be translated to english, like this one got translated to \"the wind rises\" from \"si alza il vento\"\n\nWhoopsie", ">And also because the whole story is horse shit.\n\nI mean I wanted to reply, to have a civil conversation but you don't even believe what I'm saying is real so I'm not wasting my time.\n\nHave a good day", "except it did work because the family left. if a kid looks me in the face and asks wtf i want then theyre getting that same attitude back. especially if the mom sits there and watches the kid speak like that. OP says he tried to ask them politely and nothing was working and i wouldnt want to run around searching for attendants either because thats a lot of time im missing from my movie. Telling the kid to stfu not only got the situation resolved but he also got to see more of the movie that he payed for.", "This argument is silly. I don't know of any healthy 12 year olds who will randomly punch, kick, or bite a stranger. I know plenty of 12 year olds who are mouthy jerks to complete strangers who call them out on their bad behavior. If a group of tweens are being assholes, they should be called out on it,. It's fine to give back the same energy they gave you. Tell me you have never parented a preadolescent, without saying \"I am not a parent, but\". \n\nI know plenty of 12 year olds who are as large as adults. If a 12 year old stranger came up and started punching or biting me, I would absolutely be defending myself, by any means necessary. Many 12 year old boys are already watching content that is far more graphic than what OP wrote here. Should I let a stranger physically attack me and not defend myself? Are you a 12 year old who would be offended by being told off for bad behavior? The mom may have been upset by the dressing down her children got, I can be pretty sure the \" children\" were not.", "I'm an adult and even if 100% in control would have very few qualms using obscenities directed at a child in a similar situation. Not my kids not my problem, it's up to the mother to avoid it getting to that point.", "Is it, though?", "Yes it is.", "Ah, so you're Italian and didn't realise it wasn't translated that's kinda funny \ud83d\ude02"]}
