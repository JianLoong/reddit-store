In the 10 minutes break I sat up and turned back to talk with their mother.\n\nOne of the kids said \"wtf do you want?\"\n\nAt which point I lost it and said \"you kids need to shut your fucking mouths and let others watch the god damn movie\". \n\nTheir mother immediatly grabbed me from my shirt while screaming \"how dare you say such things to my kids?!?\"\n\nI pushed her back and said \"don't you even fucking dare.

If that\u2019s how they want to behave during movies, then mom needs to provide them with a home theater.  Parents need to figure out that if their kids behavior is extremely disruptive in public, and they refuse to parent their kids the public will say something.", "I don't even have to read this to know your NTA because parents should learn to control they're fucking kids. Especially when someone tells them they're bothering other people", "NTA\n\nSince there were no staff to handle the situation you took it upon yourself. She should not have gotten physical with you and co trolled her children.", "NTA: she had plenty of opportunity to get her kids in line, if she wanted her kids to hav free reign to be as loud and annoying as they wanted she could have stayed home and watched a movie. She definitely had no right to touch you.", "NTA those kids were anoying you and everyne deserve to watch the movie in peace and these kids need to learn not everything goes their way", "NTA, and if you turned back more than once to politely request that they shut up you're already more patient than me. One of my biggest cinema pet peeves is people being loud while others are trying to watch a movie.", "Is that a cape peaking out behind you? Because you\u2019re a hero.", "You are my hero. I\u2019m your fan #1\n\nEd to add: NTA and I love you.", "you should have done that at the start\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nBut was it possible to warn the staff about this ?", "NTA - you did what everyone in that room was thinking!\nI don\u2019t get people who go to see a movie and then do anything but watch the movie.", "NTA.\n\nYou were way too generous letting them pull that shit for an hour.", "NTA. She should control her kids. You did nothing wrong. You paid for tickets and should be able to watch a movie in peace.\n\nThe fact that everyone was staring at her was the hint. She just couldn't take it.", "Not every hero wears cape. NTA. The cinema isn\u2019t their living room.", "ESH. Their mother should have been parenting and not letting them run wild but you could have gotten your point across with pg language.", "So how old were you?", "YTA - so your (understandable) reaction is to start screaming obscenities at children? Instead of being, you know, and adult and going to fetch a theater employee to deal with them (that is their job, you know). \n\nI do side with you, I've been there and it super aggravating when people don't control their kids in places like that, but whether justified or now your reaction still makes you an asshole.\n\nThere is staff SOMEWHERE. Theaters aren't completely unmanned, even in Europe.", "ESH, cause your outright lying or grossly exaggerating the details. Any normal person, after having asked the mom more then once to quiet her kids would either have moved or found an employee.

One the kid started swearing at you and the mother let it go, fair game. Well done.", "Yeah it's one of the reasons I don't like going to the cinema anymore tbh.\n\nBtw I forgot to include that one of the replies when I turned back was \"why don't you move seat if they annoy you so much?\"\n\nAnd that's another reason that makes me doubt my action. Maybe I could have just moved away and avoided such an embarrassing episode.", "I'm 22, didn't feel like it was an important detail to include", "The children started the obscenities by saying \"what the fuck do you want \" (or do you really think a 12 year old said \" w- t- f \" ( which is 5 syllables vs 3). These are middle schoolers, not toddlers.", "You've misrepresented their reaction. They did not *start* by screaming obscenities (they do not say they screamed). They start by asking the mother multiple times to handle the issue. They then asked again and we're faced with hostility from the kids which again was ignored by the mother.", "I don't know tbh, it was the first time being in that cinema and I saw nobody.  Usually there's employees selling tickets,  selling popcorn, employees who check your ticket at the entrance, etc. But I didn't see anyone here.\n\nI do feel like my reaction was exaggerated, which is why I made the post in the first place, BUT I just want to point out that I didn't scream at them or act like that as first approach.\n\nMe and my friend turned and asked various times \"could you kids stop making noise?\" ,  \"could you make your comments in a lower voice?\" and then directly at their mother \"so are you going to tell something to your kids or not?\"\n\nI then snapped when one of the kids said \"wtf do you want?\"\n\nThis is not to justify myself, just to clarify that I'm not some crazy violent dude who assaults people at first sight.", "No I didn't exaggerate anything sadly.\n\nAlso yeah I'm now considering I could have moved as I said in another comment belows.\nI would have still heard them, but maybe it could have been more bearable idk.\n\nIt's one of the reasons why I feel like I might ALSO be in the wrong, because I opted for the quickest option even if it meant being aggressive.\n\nBut majority of comments are saying I'm not an asshole, some even have the audacity to call me a hero lol and this is making it even more difficult to decide if I did good or not.\n\nAnd no there was no staff, at least I didn't see any.", "he paid for his seats so why should he have to move? if someone is being obnoxious then im gonna tell them to stfu. the mom was the one that put hands on him first! how you can blame OP for anything in this scenario is beyond me.", "I highly doubt moving seats would have helped if they were screaming in the theater. Everyone kept turning and staring at them, but no one except you actually had the guts to *do anything* about it. NTA", "That makes me feel a bit better about it.\n\nThank you."]}
