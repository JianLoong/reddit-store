So, I'm that I can finally tell you that, I like girls, I'm a lesbian.\n\nI immediately responded with: I know.\n\nShe was shocked, and shouted: You knew? How?\n\nI said: Honey, you have gay written all over your face. Honestly, I wasn't even expecting you to come out, just to come home one day to introduce your girlfriend to us.\n\nShe started crying a little, then I continued talking and retelling some key moments that give away that she likes girls, like that moment in 1st grade when she referred to her best friend as her \"bride\".\n\nShe asked if her dad knows, and I said yes.\n\nShe was hurt. Said that she has been planning coming out for so long, that was riddled by anxiety every time she tried to speak to me or her dad about it, and that I should have told her that I knew, so she could skip all the near anxiety attacks.\n\nI said that there was always a chance I could be wrong, or that she could be Bi or Pan, and in the end, she is a separate person and her sexuality is not my business. I told her I love her so much, that this changes nothing, and I will welcome any partner of hers.\n\nShe nodded with the head, but started crying and went to her room. I finished the cake, but she went out that night with her friends instead, I saved the cake in the fridge, waited for her to come home, but when she arrived went straight to her room.\n\nToday, she left for school, barely saying good morning to me.\n\nI don't know If I was too cold, too distant, or whatever, something is wrong here and I don't know if it is me.\n\nAITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUpdate:\n\nHello, I'm back here. Last night I spoke to my daughter. \n\nShe was still very emotional, but she allowed me to speak to her. I apologized for my response, I told her I was sorry, that I understood it was a big moment for her, and I wanted her to know that I will always love her.\n\nShe said was sorry for acting out, but I told her she had nothing to apologize for.\n\nWe had a long talk, she opened up about her fears. She was trying to be not be so obviously queer because some kids at her school are awful against queer kids, knowing that she is very obviously gay spiked her fears. I apologized again, and I will talk to the school administrators as soon as I can, I need to protect my daughter.\n\nShe spoke about her anxiety issues. After the talk she was calmer, but I'm worried about her, I think she might have an anxiety disorder, I'll book her a psychologist for that, she agreed to go to a psychologist. She also said that she loved me and was glad that I supported her.\n\nI told everything to her dad. He also spoke to her to say more or less the same I did, and will take her to the movies tomorrow. \n\nThank you all, mostly to the queer people telling their experiences in the comments.", "created_utc": 1667575690, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ym1ym2/aita_for_telling_my_daughter_i_already_knew_she/", "score": 10256, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She needs a while to adjust her expectations of you (for the better).  In years to come, this will be a cherished family story.", "NTA. You were just being honest, maybe \"you have gay written all over your face\" was a bit much, but I won't dwell on it. However, in the moment, all your daughter needed to hear was that you love, accept and support her and maybe a 'thank you' for sharing it with you. That's it. You could have waited for a later, more appropriate time to say that you already knew or suspected. So, NTA, but could have been handled better.", "NAH. Listen, coming out is a very emotional process and there\u2019s a lot she could be working through. For instance, if you knew she was gay, is it possible other people know who she might not want to be out with? People prepare a lot for when they come out, your reaction wasn\u2019t expected and so she\u2019s thrown off. You weren\u2019t wrong, and maybe the way she\u2019s acting is immature but this is all a very stressful, emotional time (especially for a teenager, which is already a pretty tumultuous period of life). Give your daughter space but make clear you\u2019re still supportive. Let her work through some things in private.", "Gentle YTA. The last thing anyone wants to hear when they come out is \"you're bad at hiding it, everyone knows\". \n\nFirst, apologize. Your daughter was hoping for support, which you did show, but it was overshadowed by your telling her she screams \"gay\". Tell her you didn't mean to upset her, you're happy that she shared this with you, and ask what you can do to make things better. Hug her and tell her you've always loved her and nothing can change that. \n\nMy mom expected me to be gay, and even though I dated some boys through high school, I turned out a big old lesbian. She always supported me silently, which I appreciated. One thing I might suggest, once the dust has settled, is talk with her about safe sex. Will she be allowed to have girlfriends over for sleepovers? My mom's rule was no closed doors during sleepovers, which would have worked if I had any shame. \n\nAt the end of the day, you're a good mom and you're intentions were good. Your daughter might be upset for a bit, but she knows you support her, and that's incredibly important for any LGBTQ+ teen. If you're in need of support for yourself or your family, PFLAG is a great resource.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

This is one of those situations where everyone was trying their best. She may need some time just to process that she is now \"out\" to her parents and there was no anxiety needed which will send her reeling. She may well be upset that you already knew and her \"coming out\" was... Not. Just be there for her and love her. \nI actually has to recome out to my parents as they had decided the fact my life partner is male meant I wasn't queer", "NTA the same thing happened with my sister when my niece came out.  My sister knew years before she came out and just told her she didn't care if she was gay and she was looking forward to meeting her girlfriend.  That openness worked out well in the end because her youngest daughter is also gay and felt safe coming out to her too.   Don't worry you are doing great \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08", "NTA\n\nWhen my 16yo daughter came out to me, I pretty much said the same thing and she laughed and asked how I knew. I told her we had known for years but were waiting for her to come out on her own and she was very happy with that. \n\nI hope it's just that your daughter was emotional as it's a huge moment to come out to a parent. My daughter cried a bit when she told me too, but we hugged and it was a great family moment. I'm knitting her a pride flag afghan for when she graduates high school this year (also a new laptop for college lol).", "NAH \n\nIt's tough to come out, so I think her emotional reaction is understandable. I think maybe you and her father didn't create as much of a clear, open environment where she would feel comfortable just bringing a gf home, so maybe you need to think about that more.\n\nShe needed to hear you accept her, and I think you should apologize for not reacting properly and express that even though you had an idea she was lesbian, you hope that she knows that you still love her just as much and accept her for who ah is.", "NTA mom. I think teen was just experiencing shock and yes she is hurt that you didn't make it clear that you knew.  And she doesn't know how to handle your reaction, along with relief that nothing will change. Probably a little bit of everything. Just text her saying that if you hurt her you apologize, thats the last thing you wanted to do. And you're willing to hear her out and talk when she's ready and that you love her. I bet you she'll come around. You seem like a very good mom.", "The last thing I would've wanted was my mom saying \"honey I know you're a lesbian\" when I was a baby gay before I've had the chance to vocalize it, and while every kid is different, you absolutely were not wrong for NOT saying something sooner. I don't think you were the asshole in your response, you didn't say \"I know\" snidely, you were loving and accepting (as you should be!). She's processing lots of things here, and that's OK. NAH", "NTA, of course you knew you're her mother and you've paid attention to her over the years. It sucks that she was worried you wouldn't be supportive, but you've done nothing to suggest you would be angry. I think she's just a moody teen.", "NAH, but you should apologize to her for how blas\u00e9 you were. While you intended to come off as casual and supportive, what you actually ended up doing was downplaying how serious and important this is to her, and essentially reducing her entire identity down to a punchline. Your comments to her come off as incredibly dismissive. \n\nAs a queer person, my main advice for reacting to a coming out is to match the energy of the person coming out. If the other person is blas\u00e9 and casual, you can be blas\u00e9 and casual in turn. But if they\u2019re taking it seriously, then you also take it seriously. \n\nYour daughter went through a lot of struggle, internal strife, stress, and self discovery to come to terms with who she is and what that means for her in the world we live in. As she said: she was so stressed about it that she\u2019d have anxiety attacks. Your comment essentially took all of that struggle and all of that personal growth and reflection and said: \u201cso what? It was obvious to us already.\u201d \n\nMy vote is still NAH because you didn\u2019t intend it that way, and ultimately you\u2019re supportive of her, but please be aware of how it feels to her and her perspective on the matter.", "I think this is tough (also not gay or a parent myself I\u2019ll admit) because she had gotten herself all anxious and felt like this was a huge moment - she\u2019s decided this is the moment she comes out the closet and embraces her whole self and shares that with her family and it\u2019s nerve wracking but also potentially exciting - to her this is A. Big. Moment.\n\nAnd you\u2019re just like I know and have always known. So it\u2019s no longer a big moment it\u2019s just. A conversation. A let down. And feeling foolish because it was apparently so obvious.\n\n To me it mirrors how if a small child tells you something you don\u2019t tell them everyone knows that you\u2019re accept and share their surprise - because they just learned. She\u2019s just learned who she is - even if you feel you knew already dismissing that has left her feeling naturally disappointed and deflated \n\nMaybe we\u2019re slowly inching toward a society where nobody needs to come out - or everyone does and nobody is assumed straight! And the world being that accepting would make it better in my opinion \n\nBut in the mean time it\u2019s like the two of you are just seeing this as very different moments and you\u2019re of the view that you didn\u2019t need to be told and there was no reason for her to worry because you love her and not only felt like you knew this but also your love was never in any way dependant on her being anyone other than herself - but in trying to downplay it you\u2019ve stolen the good of the moment and all she had from anxiety and disappointment", "NAH. \n\nShe's a kid and doesn't understand a lot about a lot. Also full of emotions regardless of the situation. You couldn't have known how she felt, because she never shared it with you. And the whole world is telling her that she shouldn't be lesbian and her parents shouldn't love a lesbian kid and invalidating her sexuality, as well. Not to mention, people tend to make coming out seem like it should be this dramatic event for all involved. Either the parents traumatize their kids with homophobia or they're just over the moon and everybody is screaming and crying.\n\nShe didn't get either of those responses. \n\nI bet she feels small and invalidated and angry. Also, I hear that it is never helpful when a friend or parent says \"I know\". It seems dismissive or like you could see their disease all along and were looking for signs of something \"wrong\" or different..and you found them. \n\nBut, it also isn't helpful to just straight up and ask your kid if they're lesbian.. that wouldn've have been the right move either since she has had all  this anxiety and couldn't tell you herself. So that was an unfair expectation of you as well.\n\nMy mom probably knows I'm queer, she has asked me once but she's homophobic so I could never tell her. If I did, she would say \"I've known all along\" and it would annoy me because it's not about her knowing all along, it's about me telling her that I don't give a shit what she thinks lol.. But anyway, just talk to her about how she feels and let her know that you intention was to support her and love her. Not to invalidate her.", "NAH Her official coming out was a big moment for her, and you dismissed it. She wanted it to be an equally big thing for you too, probably involving hugs and I love yous. She built it up in her head and it turned out you already knew. You're N T A for how you reacted but it's understandable that she would have liked something else.", "NAH - I'm sure it had been consuming her for a bit and she's just dealing with the shock that she was worrying herself sick over nothing. It's a useful life lesson, be bold and don't hide yourself in fear.", "NTA but let\u2019s put it this way, I\u2019m guessing maybe 80% of kids parents do not react well so she\u2019s heard and read all the horror stories. She\u2019s psyched herself up for this big argument, this fight that she just knew was going to happen. However it did not happen, so she\u2019s upset because one she had all these things she worked up to say, rebutting everything. She planned it all. So that didn\u2019t happen you were very open and loving and accepting. So not what she expected. Also tell her you never wanted to say anything in case you were wrong. That you are happy she felt ready to tell you and her father, and that no matter what you both will always be proud of her, love her and accept her. \n\nAlso let her know that you know it had to be very scary to work up telling you guys this, that she probably expected a totally different response. That you are very happy and proud of her bravery for telling you and her father. No matter what we love you and look forward to meeting anyone you bring home in the future.", "NTA", "NTA there is so much pressure around 'coming out stories' and as a member of the bunch we don't think our parents will accept it and never consider the okay cool response. Your response was spot on. Your child just needs time to process it all. She will see later how lucky she is.", "There are two different ways to say you knew.\n\n\"oh honey, you know I always sort of suspected you might be, but I'm so glad you feel comfortable sharing this with me. I would hope you know that we will always support you, but I'm sure it was still scary putting it into words, so I just want to reassure you that we still love you and we're so proud of you\"\n\nThat says that you basically still knew while still being reassuring and understanding the emotions she just went through. But instead you said \"I know\". Which is basically \"yeah, already know, whatever, dont care\". That's not what you meant, but that's how someone in an already anxious state will interpret it. It's anticlimactic and a bit of a slap in the face. \n\nSo yeah YTA. You didn't mean to, but yeah, you kinda messed up.", "NTA.  Your daughter came out to you and you acknowledged.  Now she's mad because you \"let her worry\" for all that time?  Geez, she could have come out years ago.\n\nIt is not your job to read your daughter's mind; as with most parents, we're going to get it wrong sometimes.  In this case, you seem to be a considerate and loving mother.  So, she's mad bc you understand her?  I hope she overcomes this bump in the road.\n\nHere's embarrassing: my son is a very handsome, athletically inclined, and very smart guy.  In middle school, early high school I noticed he never seemed to take an interest \"romantically\" in anyone, male or female.  During this time, his sister in high school was dabbling with being Pan or Bi, or gay.  I also just waited and watched and made sure she was safe.  Although it was awkward me telling her that her current \"love interest\" couldn't stay in her room with the door closed or spend the night.  Luckily daughter told me about most of her relationships and I just said things like \"Okay, tell me more.\" or \"How do you feel about it.\"  Sister is now happily married.\n\nSo one night son & I were alone watching a movie, and I tried to very gently ask if he was gay.  He gave out a huge guffaw and laughed until he cried.  Okay, so his answer was \"No mom, I like girls.\"  In a year or so, he started dating a girl that he cared for very much.  So I felt a bit stupid, but it all came out all right.\n\nI tell you this bc as parents we can only do what we think is best in a gentle, loving way.  So I asked my son and he laughed in my face, you didn't ask you daughter and she's miffed that you didn't.  Were not going to get it right sometimes. Go figure!", "Unfortunately,  YTA.\nThe \"I know\" you threw in her face was just a way to reaffirm that you're smarter than her. Instead than listening,  you gave her your speech. Bad timing.\nThat moment required patience, compassion, understanding and especially, love. There was very little of those in your response", "NTA.  You didn\u2019t give her the dramatic experience and she is acting entitled because she has been robbed of her \u201corigin story\u201d. Give her an Oscar so that the drama Queen inside her will have her moment /s\n\nSeriously though, take her for family therapy, because she is going to grow distant from now on. Don\u2019t let this become a thing.", "Mild YTA - I\u2019ve been in your daughters position too. I was very obviously gay as a child & came out at 16 to parents who \u201calready knew\u201d. Here\u2019s the thing tho, this is HER news to share. What she wants to hear is \u201cthank you for sharing this with me. I\u2019m so glad you trust me with this part of your life. It\u2019s wonderful that you have figured this out of yourself\u201d\n\nRegardless of how obvious it is, her realizing she\u2019s gay may still have been a difficult process of self realization - I know it was for me.\n\nShe wants acknowledgment of how difficult that internal process was For Her. It\u2019s wonderful that you are very accepting & knew quickly. However, this is HER moment to tell you about HER self discovery. \n\nThis is her news to share, let it come from her!", "NAH.\n\nThere\u2019s a strong culture of expectation around how these conversations go and how everyone is anticipated to perform. There will be capital-C Crying, whether it\u2019s positive or negative. \n\nAlso, a huge part of teenage meaning-making is individuation, navigating conflict, and drama. The queer community online makes fully clear that being queer entitles you to expect all of those things.\n\nYour daughter has a loving, supportive parent who is totally unconcerned with her sexuality. The ideal situation. \n\nHowever, inheriting this ideal situation - nearly unimaginable to queer folks less than a generation ago - has opted her out of the queer identity narratives that are still popular, especially in teen spaces\u2026including the one that says that coming out will be a moment of drama, intensity, significance, and surprise that is tied up with her fundamental identity and her reveal to the world of who she is. Your daughter was born into a world too basically-friendly for that to be necessary or true, but it means something she expected to be interesting and important about herself is instead just as neutral as being straight\u2026and there is a *little* hopeful hoopla when you come out at sixteen that being gay means something more unusual or interesting than being straight.", "YTA.\n\n> I know.\n\n> Honey, you have gay written all over your face.\n\n\"No shit, sherlock, you look gay as fuck\" is really the best you could come up with?  How about something like, oh, I don't know, 'That's great, I'm glad you feel comfortable enough to tell me that.  I love you, and I always want you to feel comfortable with who you are, and that you can always talk to me.  Is this still private information?  What do you need from me to support you?'", "YTA but a soft one\n\nWe've read a few of this on AITA. It takes tremendous courage for them to come out, and hearing that the parent knew or doesn't care one way or the other is a huge let down.\n\nThe only thing to say when a child comes out is \"I love you and always will.\"\n\nThen you can tell them all the times you had hints. But give them their moment and allow them to be seen as they want to be seen, when they're inviting you to see them.\n\nMaybe ask for a do over?\n\nEDIT: Additional thought. You know how kids will tell you something fascinating they learned about a dinasaur or something? Is the answer \"I knew that.\" Or \"Oh, really? Tell me more.\" Coming out is way bigger and more personal than that, but you choose whether you invite them to tell you more about their discoveries or you shut them down. I think that's what happened here.", "NAH\n\nI mean, you were trying to be supportive, I get that. Don't beat yourself up because your daughter didn't get a dramatic reveal, if anything it shows how in tune you are with her that you already knew. \n\nHowever, the line about \"being gay is written all over your face\" deserves an apology. I don't think it's malicious, more like a throwaway line but it probably does sound to your daughter like she has a big flashing sign over her head that says \"lesbian\". Sit her down, give her a cuddle and apologise for your phrasing, reassure her that you only meant that you know her so well that you worked it out and that it doesn't mean everyone will automatically know.\n\nGood luck OP", "NTA\n\nYou couldnt have known what the best reaction was to give here. Some people prefer reactions like yours while others want their parents to make a bigger deal out of it [positively ofc].", "NTA but I think you could have handled this better.\n\nInstead of \"I know\" and then listing all these clues, you could have just said something like \"thank you for telling me, I love you\"\n\nAfter all, if you DID know, then you also know thst coming out - at any age - is *really* hard, and you should have respected her courage in doing so", "I\u2019m going to withhold judgment because I know you meant well and I can tell you love your daughter. Please apologize for the way you phrased your response and reaffirm that you\u2019ll support her no matter who she loves. I\u2019m very glad that you\u2019re so accepting and tolerant, but coming out is a really big deal for a queer person and she was obviously nervous about telling you - and your response was a bit flippant. Her anxieties are very valid and depending on where you live, she may not be accepted by everyone. You\u2019re not an asshole, but you could work on your external sensitivity toward your daughter\u2019s identity. Don\u2019t let this discourage you or harm your relationship. You can fix this. Good luck \u2764\ufe0f", "Nta\n\nMy son announced he was bi and I said 'I don't care', meaning I'm not homophobic, I'm not going to go off on one if I don't get grandchildren and anything else Iver ever heard of.  Since before he was born I said all I want is for him to have a happy life.  Status, money unimportant.\n\nI could see it wasn't the  response he was expecting, but I thought he was probably gay anyway. Then I said 'I really don't mind, it doesn't bother me'. Still not the right thing to say.  (to me either as his sexuality isn't really any of my business, it's his) \n\nTalk about digging a great big fcking hole. Then I asked 'what did you want me to say,?'\n\n\nStill not the right thing. I think 'it's fine by me' came out with an ever increasing discomfort. \n\nThen I tried to lighten the mood and said 'you still have to bag it' \n\nI still don't know what he was expecting of me. I just want him to have a happy life. It still stands I'll chase any bstd down that hurts him or mugs him off, I don't care who they are. \n\nNta", "Gentle YTA?\n\nI made a similar mistake in HS when a close friend came out to me.\n\nI\u2019d assumed it was pretty obvious, so obvious in fact that I sort of thought it was just a unstated fact, I pretended to be his date to dances and bearded him in our highly conservative town.\n\nApparently NOT.\n\nHe\u2019d been eaten alive thinking he\u2019d been \u2018stringing\u2019 me along for years, and finally worked up the courage to \u2018break up with me\u2019/\u2018break my heart\u2019.\n\nWe were both annoyed with the other. \n\nHe was annoyed that I\u2019d thought it was *so obvious* I was annoyed that he assumed I \u2018didn\u2019t know\u2019 and had been under the impression we were actually a \u2018couple\u2019.\n\nIt was a clusterfuck.\n\nWe got over it in time, but we were both salty for awhile.", "Even though I know that you meant well, your reaction makes YTA. It's wonderful that you're accepting and will love her the way she is! However, saying \"you have gay written all over your face\" isn't exactly comforting. She's a teenager who's already probably insecure about her appearance and sexuality.

Fear (if my parents already knew I was gay, even though I\u2019ve tried really hard to keep it under wraps, how many other people know without me telling them?? This is terrifying for many reasons), 2. Anger/frustration (if my parents knew the whole time, why did I have to feel so scared to come out?

Why is me coming out to you suddenly all about how smart and perceptive YOU are, and how terrible I am at being in the closet? I have no idea why people think that telling me they already knew I was gay is reassuring, but it does the exact opposite! It makes me afraid that I\u2019m not closeting correctly, and might inadvertently be putting myself in danger when I enter an environment where it ISNT safe for me to be out.

Often, as LGBTQ+ people, we\u2019re the last ones to know that we\u2019re queer. We get bombarded with social messaging that heterosexuality is the only acceptable option from such an early age and it messes with our ability to accurately interpret our own feelings and experiences. Even if we\u2019re people for whom it *should* theoretically be obvious, it might not be. It can take a lot of internal work to figure out that you\u2019re gay. It\u2019s an emotional experience that brings many people a profound sense of self-understanding for the first time in their lives. And because we get this messaging our whole lives that we\u2019re supposed to be straight, sharing this revelation we\u2019ve come to can feel very brave and very vulnerable. Even people with liberal or accepting parents never know for sure how their folks will respond because some parents have the \u201cI\u2019m okay with other people\u2019s kids being gay but not my own\u201d attitude, and that\u2019s not really something you learn until you come out.\n\nYou didn\u2019t do anything wrong. You reacted to your daughter coming out casually and with absolute acceptance and openness. I think you were right not to speak up before. She told you when she was ready to tell you; you were right to respect her need to take her time. However, it probably never occurred to her that other people could tell she was gay because she only just figured it out herself; it was likely a massive epiphany for her. So you saying you already know may have felt to her like you were taking away from her big, brave moment of sharing this enormous self-discovery. She may have felt cut down by learning that it wasn\u2019t entirely her news to share since you\u2019d already assumed as much.\n\nWhat she\u2019s feeling right now is fair and understandable, especially for a teenager, but it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re an asshole. Give her some room to process her feelings and once she seems calm enough to be receptive, sit her down for a conversation where you acknowledge that she had a vision of how she wanted her coming out experience to go and apologize that you weren\u2019t able to give her that, but reiterate that you\u2019re proud of her for discovering this about herself, that you\u2019re excited for her to get to live her life with this deepened self-knowledge, that you appreciate her being comfortable being honest with you about this, and that you love her no matter what.\n\nI\u2019m willing to bet that in a few years your daughter will really love her coming out story.

Seriously, super-meh.  In the grand scheme of things, nobody will care.  But to the kid, at that time, it can be a huge deal.  So the parents need to match that energy.  Get excited to see the show. Make a fuss over the costume. Help rehearse. Show up on time and be attentive, and, of course clap and cheer loudly.

Even if someone coming out doesn't expect backlash, it's clear that some of the dynamics of their relationships are going to change.\n\nTelling someone coming out to you that you know is usually well-meaning, but it also invalidates that hugs amount of anxiety tied to how this will affect the relationship. And you didn't just say \"I know\", you doubled down and essentially told you daughter that during all the years when she was figuring out her own sexuality, you left her alone with that (very different) anxiety, because you had already assigned your interpretation of her sexuality.\n\nI understand from your post that you didn't mean to do that, but just try to look at this situation from the pov of a 16y-old girl who has been navigating her sexuality, the general insecurities of a 16y-old and having to tell her parents about this.\n\nIf you truly want to fix this, then go apologize that your reaction was not what she had hoped for and that you may have projected too much of your interpretation of her into her and that you didn't mean to diminish her coming out. Tell her that you are very happy and proud that she felt comfortable telling you about this and that you are impressed that she has figured out who she is at 16 (because that is impressive!).

Like you said, you didn't want to assume.\n\nHowever, likely she's feeling kind of invalidated, as if you've said \"that's ridiculous\" to all the fears she had about coming out to you. You may have truly never been homophobic or invalidating to her, individually, but her fears have been compounded over years by the very world we live in--in a practical sense, she had no absolute guarantee that you would accept her, and that eats away at a person, especially a child. \n\nMy advice is to ditch the \"I don't care who you love, I love you anyway\" approach for an active celebration of her sexuality. Like, instead of, \"I don't care that you're a lesbian,\" try \"it's good that you're a lesbian! I love you, my lesbian daughter.\" Because the fact is, being gay is a struggle. It shouldn't be, obviously, but assholes go out of their way to make it one.

So she was the first person I came out to.  It took her a bit to accept because it certainly wasnt what she expected, but last year for christmas she made me a monogrammed keychain with my pride flag (finding things with my name on them is impossible, so it was really thoughtful).\n\nKeep on loving your child.  It may not have been what she was expecting, but she will sort out her feelings.  She might be slightly disappointed that she hadnt fooled you about being straight, she might be afraid that she is obvious to other, less safe people in her life.

Now is time to many times over reaffirm that you love her and support her and that there is almost nothing in this universe that could change that.

Did you do anything to bring LGTBQ community into your child\u2019s life? Do you and your husband talk positively  and in support of LGTBQ people throughout her life? Because to me as a queer adult, these are the things that show LGTBQ youth that their parents see, support and accept them. It\u2019s not enough to know and just expect your kid to assume you still support and accept them. You need to show it in your every actions.

BUT...\n\nA tip to all parents out there who \"know\" or suspect their kid might come out or be struggling with their orientation: yeah  DONT tell them what they are, let them figure it out. But start making your opinions and support of LGBTQIA+ clear so they don't ever grow up in an environment where they would be anxious of rejection. Build an atmosphere where they feel safe with you.\n\nCasually mention support of gay marriage, or critique a politician or group for being close-minded. Casually say a gay celebrity's spouse seems pretty cool/attractive and you're glad they're together, if you do that with het celebrity couples.\nNotice pride events in your area and say you're glad your neighborhood has that and you hope things keep improving. \nDonate to good causes.\nWhen you have the \"sex talk\" discuss safety habits for different types of partners (condoms are not just to keep women from pregnancy, dental dams are a thing, etc). Do not be judgy or make hetero sex sound like the best or only option.\nMention LGBTQIA+ acquaintances in the same way as cis het acquaintances. Like \"Janice from work and her wife are rennovating their kitchen. I wonder if we should fix up our cabinets?\"  \nRead or have media (books, magazines, movies) around that feature LGBTQIA stories and characters. \n\nNot everything has to be big rainbow flags or serious talks of \"we love you no matter what\" but if you foster a healthy nurturing environment as they grow up, the goal is that they aren't wondering whether they'll be rejected. They might still be anxious, but not afraid of you and what you might do, because you've shown them in a million little ways that they would be safe.", "As a very anxious person under the LGBTQ umbrella, I have a feeling she\u2019s processing a LOT right now. There\u2019s a lot of internalized *everything* fueling anxiety over coming out, and she very well still could be coming down from all of it. I think if you sit down with her, not formally just knock on her door or something, and tell her again that you love her, that you\u2019ll always support her, and acknowledge all the anxiety she was feeling and tell her that she can always talk to you, or write it down if she\u2019s having trouble organizing her thoughts.

And you're telling her that you've always known something that she probably took a lot of time realizing and coming to terms with. \n\nI know you can't redo this, but tbh the first response to someone coming out should never be \"I know\", ever. This is a miscommunication, and you didn't mean to hurt her, but you are the one who did something hurtful.", "NAH. I think you could\u2019ve been a little gentler, she was clearly very vulnerable in that moment, but your heart was in the right place. Just a fraught moment.", "NTA, but insensitive.\n\n\"I said: Honey, you have gay written all over your face.\"  \n\nWhat the .... what?????", "Soft YTA. I used to think I would reply the way you did should my kids be LGBTQIA+. Reading \"The Savvy Ally\" made me realize that's not the best response. \n\nComing out is a huge deal. Even the most accepting family can be intimidating for someone to come out to. When we reply with \"Oh I knew\", not only can it invalidate them in the moment, it can also cause them to wonder why they may not have known something about themselves that was clear to others. It's more harmful than we realize.", "NAH. As a queer person, I had a lot of friends who knew I was gay before I came out. The biggest fear is rejection. I\u2019m glad you were warm to her and that your view on her hasn\u2019t changed. \n\nWith that being said, from your daughter\u2019s view she feels very different from everyone else, especially at a time of life when being different can feel bad. She wanted to let you in on this big secret, and it can be kind of disappointing/invalidating and underwhelming when you  simply say \u201cI know.\u201d As if this isn\u2019t some big life moment for her. She\u2019s looking for assurance and acceptance first and foremost, not a simple confirmation. Also, she probably thought she was passing pretty well as a straight person, and with you saying you know, she\u2019s probably reevaluating what passing looks like and if her peers can also tell before she\u2019s ready to tell them. Again, you didn\u2019t do anything wrong, I would just reaffirm her that you love her very much, regardless of what gender she dates. She\u2019s not wrong for feeling invalidated that your response isn\u2019t what she was expecting, but your response wasn\u2019t bad, just room for improvement.", "gentle YTA\n\nThe problem wasn't that you knew, but probably the way you handled it. A gentle and more caring aproach would be way better.", "Gentle YTA\n\nComing out isn\u2019t just about telling the other person something about you, it\u2019s accepting a part of yourself and being proud enough of it to tell people. In the moment it should have been just about her and you should have just told her you loved her and thanked her for telling you. Telling her you knew already could have been saved for later\n\nHOWEVER, you weren\u2019t trying to be an asshole or hurtful and intent is really important. Just apologize to your daughter and ask her what you could have done differently, and then try and do that the next tim\u2019s big thing comes up. \n\nWe all screw up sometimes and that\u2019s okay, you love your daughter and when she has some time to process she\u2019ll see that", "I\u2019ll probably get downvoted, but I\u2019m going to say slight YTA. Coming out is *difficult*. I imagine her journey to coming to terms with her sexuality was a long one, even though you say that you\u2019ve known for a while. I disagree with your daughter\u2019s claim that you should\u2019ve told her that you knew, but you could\u2019ve had a much better response than \u201cI know\u201d after she\u2019s finally worked up the courage to come out to you. Not only does it take away the fact that this was a monumental moment to your daughter, but it can also be invalidating of her journey of discovering herself. Like you knew before she even knew herself. I think that would suck to hear for anyone in that situation", "Very very soft YTA, though i feel like NAH is more fitting. The response of \"i know/knew\" when coming out can feel very invalidating, especially as a kid. It would have been much better if you had started by saying that you love her, support her, and that this doesn't change your love for her, and then later after she got all her feelings out you could talk to her about her childhood/how you suspected. I don't think you meant any harm to her, and I'm were reacting in a way that you thought would be supportive, but that's unfortunately not what happened. Because you suspected, you could have done some research on how to react/be supportive when your daughter came out, and you would have seen that responding with \"I know\" is something most queer people would not appreciate. (I'm sure some people did/would like this reaction, but the majority that I've seen considers it.. Uncomfortable to say the least). You seem like you're trying, and want to be a good parent, so I can't judge you too harshly. I'm certain this isn't something that's going to forever break your relationship, you just need to talk to her and listen to/validate her emotions. Good luck!", "Soft YTA here- you say \u201cI know\u201d with a lot of confidence, but it\u2019s not something you know as a fact (which you actually later admit). It\u2019s not up to you. I get that you would want to assure your daughter but it\u2019s not about showing off how observant of a parent you are, it\u2019s about acknowledging and validating your daughter as a person.\n\nSo sounds like she spent some time and energy summoning the strength for a pronouncement you kinda unknowingly sucked the wind out of. She has her own feelings and expectations and so she\u2019ll have to work them out and i would urge you to focus on them. Good on you for accepting your daughter, but ultimately i think it might have been better received if you had responded immediately by asking if there\u2019s anything you can do for her/focusing on her feelings instead.", "Yeah, soft YTA.  Props to you immediately accepting your daughter coming out to you, but this was probably the biggest moment of her life to date, and by saying \"yeah, I know\" you ~~kind of~~ diminished it. \n\n\"Honey, we're proud of you, and your Dad and I love you no matter what,\" is all you needed to say.  She gets the opportunity to have her moment (that she's probably been working up the courage to do for at least a couple of years now), and you get to be the awesome, understanding parent that she hopes you would be.", "NTA I bet she'll look back on this in years to come and just be glad you were so accepting.", "NAH. I think coming out has such polarizing reactions that I can see the kid having complicated feelings about your reaction. You seem very supportive, so try not to take that personally. She\u2019s probably pondering how others perceive her now that she\u2019s aware this was apparently obvious to you.\n\n\nBut\u2026\u201dgay written all over your face\u201d\u2026is a bit much. I\u2019m straight and people say that about/to me all the time. I just like having short hair and wearing non-constricting clothes. I don\u2019t like that other people question/make assumptions about something that isn\u2019t their business \u201cYou\u2019re straight? Really? Are you sure??\u201d (seriously, if we are not sleeping together, you don\u2019t need to comment).", "NAH\n\nLook, I get you had good intentions, but I don't think you went about this the right way. \n\nShe's probably now terrified that EVERYONE knows. Her family, the teachers at school, *the bullies at school.*\n\nMaybe you're kind and accepting and tolerant. Not everyone is. *And she almost certainly knows that.* There are always going to be bullies and homophobes in all walks of life. She's most likely petrified of them immediately clocking her now. \n\nStaying in the closet is a defence mechanism for a lot of queer folks, especially queer kids. I realise you probably wanted to say *\"I've always known because you're my daughter and I know you best and I don't care which way you swing\",* but there's a good chance she heard \"*your defence mechanism didn't work. I saw right through it. And so can everybody else\"*", "YTA, softly. You are not a bad person though and I need to make that clear, it's a misunderstanding. I am going to be going against majority here, I'm queer and going at this from that view. I think \"I already know, I knew it, etc.\" is a bad response to coming out whether it be for sexuality or gender coming outs. It is quite literally in every list of, \"Ten things not to say when loved one comes out.\" \n\nPeople are going to be upset with this because they don't view it as bad and simply \"being honest\". \n\nIt's dismissive, it comes off as the child's fears and anxiety has been disregarded. Instead of addressing this by sitting down and saying right off the bat, \"I love you, I support you, thank you for telling me. Is there anything I can do to help you during this?\" You gave a response that (unintentionally) trivializes your child's feelings. \n\nIt doesn't really open up room for discussion or even provide comfort. It just lets your child know that not only are they visibly queer to the point that strangers might notice, but that instead of having an adult conversation about boundaries and reassurance, it turns to your child now wanting to figure out what makes them visibly queer and learn how to hide this better. I don't know the area you live in, but I lived in a small conservative town in Texas where the queer kids got sent to Alternative Schooling at the church. Being visibly queer was a nightmare. If my parents told me this, it would be anxiety inducing. \n\nYou messed up, unintentionally, but I don't think you as a person are an asshole. You clearly care about your child and want the best. I think you should sit down, apologize for unintentionally causing them discomfort, and explain what I said earlier. \"I love you, I support you, thank you for telling me. Is there anything I can do to help you during this?\" You can also explain that you said what you did not to trivialize, but to let her know that you support her and will not treat her different regardless of her sexuality and that it came out wrong. \n\nI want everyone to also realize that just because I'm voting YTA doesn't mean I think you are a bad person. I just think you slipped up and really this subreddit doesn't have a \"You messed up, but you're not an asshole\" answer.", "Soft YTA. I\u2019m echoing other commenters here, but the ideal response would have been to validate and appreciate the courage of her coming out, rather than focusing so much on the fact that you already knew she was gay. Listing all the signs like a damn scavenger hunt, rather than acknowledging how brave she was to face a scary thing and to overcome it, probably came across very dismissive and infantilizing to her. You could have applauded her strength, but instead you kinda made her feel small.", "NTA obviously.\n\nBut: You didn't handle it well. Instead of focusing on how obvious it was, you should reassure your daughter, tell her, that she never needs to be anxious about how tell you things. It was a big step for her.", "NAH I don\u2019t think you were aiming to upset her but it\u2019s obviously been important to tell you and she may not like feeling like, potentially, a stereotype or similar. I think thank you for telling me is a better response in this situation.", "You know , this OP accepts her daughter, and loves her. There are parents who throw their kids out or try to change them. It doesn\u2019t matter to me if my child was gay. I have an uncle and cousin that are gay. Mom NTA. Your daughter will come round. She may just need to process.", "I\u2019m a lesbian! I\u2019m sorry but YTA. This is just never the response to give when someone comes out to you. People did it to me and it just feels shitty, especially for it to be THE FIRST thing out of your mouth. Your kid was coming out to you, and that is a big deal for her. Saying \u201cI know\u201d is not acknowledging what she is doing, AND it can feel embarrassing for the person coming out. \n\nAnd in all honesty, guess what, you didn\u2019t \u201cknow\u201d. You thought so, and it turns out you were correct. But you didn\u2019t know until that very moment she told you. And you should have thanked her for telling you and reminded her you loved her. THATS the first thing that should come out of your mouth.", "This is a complicated issue that comes down to the \"i know\" response for a lot of people bringing up feelings of \"well if you knew all along why didnt you do xyz to show that you supported me or to make me know im safe and save me from the fear?\" Im not going to call you the asshole because i dont think anyone is here, but it's worth having a conversation with your daughter about what you couldve been doing to support her all along!! It's also a little scary knowing people you haven't told know, especially for such a young person in the world we live in today.", "NTA, I know a lot of people that wish they got a reaction like this. Thank you for accepting and loving them as they are.", "NAH. Think of this for a second: You're battling with something for a long time, you think it through and finally come up with a conclusion. Then when you tell someone they just say \"I know.\" No one likes hearing that, no matter the circumstance.\n\nBut your support is what matters most here. Once she gets over the initial shock, as long as you continue to show your acceptance, she should come around.\n\nIf you really want to help smooth things over faster you can apologize for saying you knew, and explain how you had a feeling but wanted to respect her own self discovery. Imagine how shitty she would feel if she was straight and you told her you thought she was a lesbian! There isn't really a win in that scenario for you. You can tell her you could have dropped more hints that would show how accepting you are of LGBT people so she wouldn't feel so anxious, but hope she knows now how much you love her and are sorry for any unwanted stress you caused.\n\nThis is just one of those situations where a minute change in vocabulary can really change the effect saying something has. I'm sure you two will sort it out soon :)", "Sorry, YTA. Okay, so you knew already. You didn't have to invalidate her like that. If you know already, maybe you should have done some research. Coming out is sadly still a big deal for a lot of people and is super stressful. I feel like you were super short about this really brave thing she did. You could have offered comfort and shown an interest before basically shutting her up with \"I know\" and \"you've got gay written all over you\".", "NTA. I'm a lesbian and I think this would have been fine. It's way better than what my mom did, which was sit me down and tell me she knew before I was ready to come out to her. She's projecting all of that anxiety that she had onto you and blaming you because she now feels stupid for being so anxious about it. You didn't do anything wrong. I do see people saying they don't like \"I know,\" but it's a super personal thing because I genuinely don't care. I came out to some coworkers I worked in a factory with and they said they knew and I was like \"chill, now I don't have to worry about people treating me differently now that they know; they've known the whole time.\"", "NAH because you were very supportive, but bordering on Y-T-A. She's upset because you were unintentionally quite dismissive about the struggles she's experienced to come out.\n\nShe wasn't \"expecting a grand reaction\", it's just terrifying to come out. Your reaction probably felt diminishing towards the long-time fear and shame she's likely felt around coming out. You should apologize for that, even if it's not at all what you intended.", "Slight YTA because if you swapped in any other big life changing announcement, saying \" I know\" would come off as... deflating, insensitive and smug \nI'm pregnant!

With that in mind your response was a little like letting the air out of her balloon.\n\nIn retrospect you should have let her have her moment, tell her you loved her and left it at that.  There was time to tell her you knew (Suspected is probably the more appropriate word) at a later point.  I'm not saying YTA because you aren't. You responded the best way you knew how.\n\nAt this point the only thing you can do is communicate with her and let her know that you understand that your response may not have been what she imagined or what she wanted but that nothing changes the fact that you love her.

You say her sexuality is \u201cnone of your business\u201d. I disagree - you should be aware that the world is not always kind to LGBT people, and it\u2019s your business if your child is struggling with that. It seems kind of reminiscent of when people say they \u201cdon\u2019t see colour\u201d, when race factors into so many aspects of people\u2019s lives.\n\nYour daughter is clearly struggling and it seems like it was more important for you to say you knew all along than it was to acknowledge her feelings and how hard this has been for her. Let her know that you are sorry if you ever did anything that made her think you weren\u2019t a safe person to be open with. That should be your concern right now.\n\nUltimately, NAH. But you will be an asshole if you continue to be glib and dismissive about the effect this has had on her and may continue to have on her. Just because it doesn\u2019t matter to you whether your child is gay, that doesn\u2019t mean everyone else is suddenly going to be cool with it.

She agonized about it, she was afraid to do it, and you just blew her off. EDIT: And yes I have a now adult kid who came out to me.

She shouldn't be frustrated at *you* necessarily, but I understand.\n\nMy mom actually did sit me down at a restaurant and ask me if I (f) and my best friend (also f) and it was a gigantic yes. I was shocked that it was obvious. She didn't give a shit, and had her own romances with females. I'm relieved that I didn't feel like I had to hide a part of myself in my own home.\n\nBut how could you have known for sure? Plus, sometimes even if people are gay, they feel such shame and embarrassment that it leads them further into the closet if someone asks. \n\nI believe you did the right thing. I think that her frustration is just being misdirected mostly because she's a teenager full of angst and confusion and hormones. Just give her a hug and say \"I would've said something if I'd known it would make it easier for you. I'm sorry\" and take her out for icecream or something so that you guys can celebrate her coming out day!", "NTA LOL  no one was surprised when my sister came out like 20-something years ago even though at the time my mother thought it was 'just a phase' or that 'she just wasn't happy with Todd (fake name)' so we kinda knew but not totally because being gay is more than just who you sleep with- she was more tomboyish than me, had 'boyfriends' that seemed like they didn't 'fit' or that she had no 'type' .  I think she was more surprised when I didn't go 'whaaattt?'' like she expected more people to be shocked and we weren't. Now my mom is over her initial being weird about it and loves my sister's wife.", "NAH. My dad said the same when I came out. For me it was a relief but I still had to process all of the anxiety and fear that I had been dealing with. I had the advantage of being able to go home to my apartment 3 hours away to process that.

It's good when parents are unconditionally accepting of their children. That said I always hated it when my parents made assumptions about me, even when they were right. I think you might have made a mistake by saying you've always known your daughter was gay. Saying \"I know\" shuts down the conversation and makes it harder for your daughter to relay her feelings and her journey with you because \"you already know\".

Coming out is scary and anxiety inducing, expecially if you don't know how your parents will react, but considering that she's a teen she's probably trying to process her emotions and the burden she had for some time that she really didn't have to carry on her shoulders.\n\nOne of the reasons why I tell any teen to wait until after moving out is bc of this fear and getting kicked out, nothing feels better than saying your truth but getting the possibility to cut the person out if they don't accept you.", "NTA \n\nAt university, we had a friend who was very obviously gay. Everybody in our friend group suspected / knew it.\n\nAt his birthday party he came out. He was quite pale and shaky.\nWe just looked at each other and I think several people said \u201cwe know\u201d at the same time. \n\nIt took me quite some time to understand why he was so upset.

This was a huge moment for your daughter, potentially one of the biggest moments in her life, and you didn't really give it the attention it deserved. If you already knew, this was not the time to say it. This was her time just to present information to you. It would have been better to tell her that you appreciate her courage and honesty in being her true self, and that you love and accept her regardless of her sexual orientation. Then go get a cake.", "I think her upset was really a release of all the anxiety she had built up in preparation to tell you, but just verbalized it as upset with your reaction.

Wish all par and people thought that way \n\nGive her some time to calm, talk with her friends, and she'll probably come to you with a different attitude.", "NAH. I agree with other comments that saying \u201cI know\u201d when someone works up the courage to tell you something important can be invalidating. I can also see that you wanted (maybe subconsciously) to show your daughter that you know her, you pay attention to her and therefore you already had an inkling of her sexual orientation. Perhaps you were even a little flippant in your response because you wanted to show her how ok you are with her being a lesbian. However that might have come out a bit hurtful.", "Nta.

After she told me I said \"Okay!\". I then told her that she didn't have to be just a lesbian and that she could be anything she wanted and not to worry about being stuck into one box. She may find out later that she is bi or something else entirely but to stay true to herself. I then explained to her that because she has chosen to proudly live this way she will meet people in her life that will be mean to her and treat her different because they don't agree with it but to stay proud and understand that it has nothing to do with her and that it's their own personal issues. So far she has been accepted by the majority of her peers (she is only 12). Just keep telling your daughter you love her and maybe do something to show the rest of the world you support her like displaying a pride flag on your car or something like that and eventually she will realize how lucky she is to have accepting parents. A lot of kids were not blessed that way.", "Eh, idk, I don't think YTA exactly, your heart was in the right place, but you were a little insensitive. I do agree that confronting her about her sexuality before you felt she was ready to talk about it with you could have caused a problem, too - what if you were wrong? It's not your place to tell someone else what THEIR sexual orientation is. I DO see her point about having anxiety and being afraid to tell you only to find out you already suspected as much. Hindsight is 20/20, however, I do think you could have sat her down around puberty age and told her that when she did bring someone home as a love interest, that you would embrace that person regardless of their gender.

There\u2019s lots of drama going on, much of it if our own making because we have not finished developing psychologically and neurologically.

Coming out is coming out as a true self, to speak honestly, to live honestly.  Your response was your honest response.  Her skipping out on you was not the best way to react to your honest response.  What you knew or didn't know isn't the point.  Personally, I think you have behaved respectfully toward your daughter's sexuality.  You recognized it wasn't your business.  I remember being 16 and having a very dramatic imagination.

This is a NAH instead.", "Honestly, most parents who actually pay attention to their kids can tell when their kid is gay. When I came out to my mom she ALSO said \"I knew.\" My wife's (albeit shitty) family ALSO knew. Sometimes it's just a feeling, and saying \"I know\" is probably the best case scenario response. Anything else would add even more anxiety - imagine your parent just saying \"oh...\" and NOTHING ELSE! No thanks. NTA x1000000\n\nQuick Edit: IMO OP's daughter kinda sounds like she wanted some sort of 'freak out' from her instead of \"I know.\" Maybe wanted clout for it? Sympathy from her peers? This is just odd...one should be ecstatic that their parent isn't trying to actively murder them for being a \"sin against god.\"", "This. NAH. She got thrown through a loop is all. I guess just ask if she wants to talk about it some more OP since she's still upset.\n\nIf my mom came up to me as a teen and said \"I know you're gay\" I would've burst into tears and/or been extremely pissed, it probably would have pushed me to pretend to be straight out of like, defiance or something.\n\nIt was bad enough being bullied for my orientation before I even knew what I was if my mom came over and said that I'd just feel ashamed.\n\nIt's important to figure it out and accept yourself first.", "I think back to when I was coming out, how stressful it was, how you could never tell how someone would take it (they might be \"accepting\" in theory but not when it comes to their real child/sibling/friend.

If this is their big moment, react like it\u2019s a big deal; if they\u2019re super casual, then be cool. I have thought about this a lot as I\u2019ve come out to various folks ofer the years and had a variety of reactions. \n\nOP, NAH - you weren\u2019t trying to be malicious or unsupportive, and your daughter has a lot to process right now.", "THIS RIGHT HERE. People when they are young, aren't always sure who they are and may take awhile to establish their sexuality. They could believe they are straight, or gay or bi or change their minds, etc before settling on what feels comfortable to them.

For me, I needed my mom to tell me that I was going to be okay. OP did a relatively good job compared to mine, but, the point is that this is a variable experience based off of who is coming out to who and, should you ever find yourself in the position where a distressed/afraid/emotional kid is coming out to you, use your best judgment to decide how to make *them* feel okay.", "Hearing \u201cI know\u201d can actually be really invalidating. You can tell your kids you suspected, but it should never be your first response. Her daughter isn\u2019t upset because she didn\u2019t get a Hallmark moment, she\u2019s upset because coming out is a journey with self-acceptance, and it can be hard to be told \u201cI know\u201d when you didn\u2019t always know yourself.\n\nComing out takes trust and courage. Any response should keep that in mind.\nOP isn\u2019t an asshole, she\u2019s a good, supportive, well-meaning mom.

I think one day OP's daughter will feel the same.\n\nBut yes, apologize just for the sake of it. This conversation was stressful for your daughter, for reasons that are vastly beyond your or her control. I think she would have been overwhelmed no matter how the conversation went, honestly. Apologize not because you're wrong, but because she's a kid doing a scary thing and that's a way to express support. And if there's some specific reason beyond \"coming out is scary\" that this was so daunting for her \u2014 if there are peers, relatives, teachers, even your husband who have actually said and done things to make her feel unsafe about it \u2014 you'll need to proactively establish trust.", "I don't really know, I'm trying to remember saying something that might sound of being interpreted as homophobic, but I think my brain might be biased, but just to think something might have slip thought my lips in the past makes me feel very bad.\n\nI'm thinking about my mom rn, who is dead btw.

She probably is laying blame where there is none to be had, because feeling so much feels burdensome.

They didn\u2019t say anything homophobic! Ever! They were probably just quiet on the idea of different sexualities because they didn\u2019t really talk about sexuality period, beyond consent and safe sex\n\nBut their quiet neutrality on the subject still made it very scary for their people-pleasing daughter to come out, especially in a homophobic world.\n\nYou probably never said anything homophobic! You have probably raised her to know that love is beautiful, no matter what kind. But creating a safe space takes a really active approach. Sort of, queer positivity instead of queer neutrality.\n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s an easy thing to do. I don\u2019t even think you did something wrong. I think it\u2019s just a learning experience, and a lesson to be outwardly, explicitly approving moving forward.", "So, it's important to understand that the fear of coming out is real for everyone, especially minor teens. Even if you're the perfect example of accepting, affirming, LGBTQIA+ positive; even if your child was +100% positive they knew you'd be accepting and loving; the act of coming out still means that they fear a chance they wouldn't be accepted. And, there are still too many horror stories out there about kids getting cut off, kicked out, and abused for coming out or being outed. \n\nYour child is going through a lot of complicated feelings right now. And, frankly, she's probably still figuring out the details of who she is and what that means for her. (Because every 16 year old is still figuring out who they are and what that means for them.) \n\nI don't think it's likely that you did anything wrong. Just give your kid the time and space she needs to process her feelings. When you get a chance, reinforce that you love and support her no matter what, and that you're available to talk more when and if she's ready. She's already shown that she thinks you're a safe person by coming out, so she'll likely come back to you once she has a chance to process and see that your acceptance is genuine. \n\nAside: given your concern about what you were exposed to with your mom and sister, it's probably worth learning about the types of microagressions and more subtle homophobic statements and behaviors that you might have learned without realizing. A group like PFLAG might be able to help with that. I know from my own experience that my mom in particular can be pretty bad with some of those issues, and it absolutely made me feel that i wasn't entirely safe sharing some parts of my life with her. (I'm bi and mostly lived away from home once i started college, so it was relatively easy to just not talk about some stuff.) I do believe that she does her best, and she'd never be one of the true horror story parents, but i will likely never actually have any sort of open/coming out conversations with her or any other immediate family.", "If you knew that your daughter is gay as you say.

If you knew that your daughter was gay, did you ever feel the need to defend her when her grandmother said something homophobic?", "Don't worry, I think you are overthinking it. She is probably just processing the situation after she had herself all hyped up and stealed for the slight possibility of a negative response. Just give her a couple of days and she will come around. You will probably laugh about it together later.\n\nFun fact: The character of Dafydd in Little Britain was based on Matt Lucas's own experience in small town Wales. He came out as gay and absolutely nobody was surprised or cared, he was a little disappointed that it wasn't a big deal he thought it was going to be. \n\nIn the show, the skits surrounding Dafydd always have people acting super tolerant of gay people and the main character acting like it's a big deal and he's \"the only gay in the village\". For example, he will go in to buy his new issue of a gay magazine only for the elderly lady at the news stand to tell him that it had a very informative article on rimming \ud83d\ude02", "I read that, but clearly her daughter was more caught up on her initial reaction so she needs to apologize and then reiterate that part", "Saying \"I Know\" in reaction to coming out often doesn't turn out well.

To find out that your parents already knew makes it seem like they went through an emotional rollercoaster for nothing.\n\nIf you already know, make an environment where the person feels safe coming out.", "When you've spent a long period of time struggling to figure yourself out, and finally come to terms with your sexuality, its not validating when the response is \"No shit, Sherlock. Everyone already knows this and you have gay written all over your face\"", "Yeah, the \"you have gay written all over your face\" line made me wince hard.  It must have made her immediately flash back through so many different moments, and feel like everyone knew before she had accepted herself. \n\nI wish people didn't just assume she wanted \"drama\" because she's a teen.  I can understand how she feels.", "Yeah like... it is terrifying and a lot of people saying she wanted drama don't get it. If her mom and dad knew, that means other people can tell. What if she's not ready? What if a stranger can tell and decides she needs to be hate crimed for it? That's a terrifying possibility, especially when someone is still in the closet and slowly working their way out. It also doesn't matter if *you* (general) think a feeling is valid or not. If the person has an issue, and the daughter did, it's an issue.\n\nI think OP should apologize for being dismissive, both for not affirming that she loves and supports her and wants to be there for her with this journey, and for dismissing her mental health. \"So she can stop having panic attacks over it\" can come off as very dismissive of someone's feelings, especially when it's a stressful situation. I think it's also worth asking *why* she was so scared. Lots of people go \"I support my gay child\" while bashing gay people who are too flamboyant, who \"push it in everyone's face\", who support anti gay politicians and laws, who say micro aggressions without even realizing it. Even if it was one comment, the kid is gonna pick up on that, and is going to feel unsafe so it's worth asking *why* they were so scared. Your child should never be afraid of you, or afraid of talking to you. Ever.

My own mother likes to center herself during any kind of emotional or difficult moment for me, and it's caused me to go low contact with her.

It can help them feel like there is more of a world & therefore less risk to lose the \"only ones\". It can strangely make them have an easier time with the core family, having more to vent to. That's the hopeful positive to community ^^; doesn't always work ofc.\n\nI say this as I had tons of friends who had good family lives but still lied to parents or hid things because they just didn't feel okay telling them.

Even with the most vocal LGBTQ+ supporting family, I'd still be worried if I had to come out. You just never really know until it's out there. It'll PROBABLY be fine but what if it isn't? You need a heck of a plan B when coming out even if it's unlikely that your family kicks you out. \"Like 95% sure it's fine\" is still scary odds if the last 5% means you're homeless at 15.  \n\nA good example is Cheer, a huge gay icon with tons of gay friends and she still had a melt down when her kid joined the LGBT ranks and I think I remember it was even worse when he came out as trans. If I remember correctly, it took them some years to reconcile. Does it make sense? No. But feelings rarely do. \n\nI had a talk with my parents as a teen in the 90ties where I asked how they'd feel if I was gay.

Saying \u201cI know\u201d is kinda dismissive. \n\nI\u2019ve settled on \u201cThank you for telling me,\u201d with a plan to let her steer the rest of the conversation. Maybe ask if she wants me to do anything different, or if there\u2019s someone she wants to introduce me to.", "Many of my family members, particularly my Pop, \"knew\" I was lesbian as a teen/young adult... because I liked theatre, leaned more 'left',  loved sports, and wasn't into makeup, clothes, and hair like my sister...\n\nI'm 35 now I still have a lot of insecurities about liking sports, theatre, and try as I may... not caring a lot or being good at makeup/hair. And yet... I'm still positive I'm not lesbian or even bi.", "I found out that no matter how accepting you are and how much you try to drive that point home - they will probably still have some nervousness and anxiety. I had it happen with my kid. I still really don't get why it was such an issue. \n\nBest I can figure out is it's something internal that becomes huge and causes all sorts of feelings. All these feelings build up and throw logic out the door. \n\nI will say as a parent, like everything else - no matter how you answer you will question if you could have been better. Like a billion times. Did I show enough acceptance? Too much acceptance? Was I supportive enough? Should I throw a party? Bake a cake? How involved do they want me? \n\nJoys of being a parent.", "I think this is under recognized. Everyone's commenting like the mom was trying to twist the whole scenario to be about how she's such a good mom because she knew all along. That's not what happened.\n\nMom said she knew because her daughter clearly had anxiety about \"coming out\" - in no way was this making it all about herself. She was trying to provide comfort during a time of stress.", "I had a child come out to me and despite doing all kinds of things like literally waving the rainbow flag and putting it on a flag pole they were still stressed about it. Regardless of how accepting you appear on the surface they\u2019re like still stressed about revealing a private part of them selves", "This is how I feel about women. Women are gorgeous, so soft and pretty! All shapes, colors, sizes. SO PRETTY. Don't really want to boink one. BUT SO PRETTY!", "THIS. My mother made it a point to introduce me to friends who had \"two mommies\" and make me more accepting even though I didn't really get it or care. Fast forward to me at 13, coming out. She told me it was a phase and she knows what I really like. When I reminded her that I'm bisexual around 10th grade, she said \"so where's your girlfriend?\" I had the highest GPA of my grade, on the honor roll and never went to hang with friends at the mall. No time for a boyfriend/girlfriend. It was me realizing she only accepted \"gay\" outside of her home. Joke's on her though. I haven't spoken to her since I was 17 and jumped out of the bedroom window because she locked me in. She's never met her grandchildren and doubt she ever will. Unrelated to the gay thing but STILL \ud83d\ude02", "Lmao this is EXACTLY how I feel about women. They're pretty and I love looking at them, but I have no desire to have sex with one. \ud83e\udd23", "I think I may have done that to my friend inadvertently. I didn't say 'I know' but I just got a little surprised, thought for a moment and said, \"Oh. I guess that explains the walk.\"  \n  \nHe exploded, \"You're the third person to say something about the walk! Is it really that noticeable?!\" Oops.", "This. She 16, she\u2019s literally a teenager dealing with hormones and trying to figure herself out. Jumping to \u2018clout\u2019 as reasoning says more about the commenter than the daughter. \ud83d\udc85", "I didn\u2019t wait until my daughter started asking questions to tell her that it was okay to be gay. From the time she was very little, I would start discussions by saying things like, \u201cWhen you get older, your husband or your wife, depending on who you marry \u2026\u201d or \u201cyour boyfriend or girlfriend, depending on who you\u2019re dating \u2026\u201d\n\nI took her to pride marches, my long-term partner and I have MANY gay, lesbian, non-binary, asexual, gender-fluid, trans and queer friends between us \u2026 and yet, she STILL had mad anxiety coming out to me (first as bi and then as pansexual). Anxiety in spite of the fact that she has ALWAYS KNOWN I would be perfectly accepting. \n\nConversations with Grandma went a little differently. \ud83d\ude02\n\n\u201cMimi, I\u2019m pansexual.\u201d\n\n(*pause*)\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re attracted to \u2026 cookware?\u201d\n\n(*much longer pause and a lot of blinking*)\n\n\u201cOKAY, LET\u2019S START OVER.\u201d\n\n\ud83d\udc46\ud83c\udffb Actual conversation. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n\nFrom what my kid told me later, she felt anxious about discovering she was bi (leaning more towards liking women) because SOCIETY IN GENERAL made her feel like it wasn\u2019t okay to be anything other than straight. And while there were some depictions of gay characters in kids television shows (*cough* the principal in Jimmy Neutron *cough*), the characters were often a punchline. To this day, NO kids movie that I\u2019m aware of has ever showed two same-sex characters living \u201chappily ever after\u201d.\n\nShe\u2019s right. As inclusive as I had tried to be, there weren\u2019t any gay couples in the media she was saturated with, even though we had (still have \ud83d\ude42) many gay couples in our real life."]}
