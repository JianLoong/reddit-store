She needs a while to adjust her expectations of you (for the better).  In years to come, this will be a cherished family story.", "NTA. You were just being honest, maybe \"you have gay written all over your face\" was a bit much, but I won't dwell on it. However, in the moment, all your daughter needed to hear was that you love, accept and support her and maybe a 'thank you' for sharing it with you. That's it. You could have waited for a later, more appropriate time to say that you already knew or suspected. So, NTA, but could have been handled better.", "NAH. Listen, coming out is a very emotional process and there\u2019s a lot she could be working through. For instance, if you knew she was gay, is it possible other people know who she might not want to be out with? People prepare a lot for when they come out, your reaction wasn\u2019t expected and so she\u2019s thrown off. You weren\u2019t wrong, and maybe the way she\u2019s acting is immature but this is all a very stressful, emotional time (especially for a teenager, which is already a pretty tumultuous period of life). Give your daughter space but make clear you\u2019re still supportive. Let her work through some things in private.", "Gentle YTA. The last thing anyone wants to hear when they come out is \"you're bad at hiding it, everyone knows\". \n\nFirst, apologize. Your daughter was hoping for support, which you did show, but it was overshadowed by your telling her she screams \"gay\". Tell her you didn't mean to upset her, you're happy that she shared this with you, and ask what you can do to make things better. Hug her and tell her you've always loved her and nothing can change that. \n\nMy mom expected me to be gay, and even though I dated some boys through high school, I turned out a big old lesbian. She always supported me silently, which I appreciated. One thing I might suggest, once the dust has settled, is talk with her about safe sex. Will she be allowed to have girlfriends over for sleepovers? My mom's rule was no closed doors during sleepovers, which would have worked if I had any shame. \n\nAt the end of the day, you're a good mom and you're intentions were good. Your daughter might be upset for a bit, but she knows you support her, and that's incredibly important for any LGBTQ+ teen. If you're in need of support for yourself or your family, PFLAG is a great resource.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

This is one of those situations where everyone was trying their best. She may need some time just to process that she is now \"out\" to her parents and there was no anxiety needed which will send her reeling. She may well be upset that you already knew and her \"coming out\" was... Not. Just be there for her and love her. \nI actually has to recome out to my parents as they had decided the fact my life partner is male meant I wasn't queer", "NTA the same thing happened with my sister when my niece came out.  My sister knew years before she came out and just told her she didn't care if she was gay and she was looking forward to meeting her girlfriend.  That openness worked out well in the end because her youngest daughter is also gay and felt safe coming out to her too.   Don't worry you are doing great \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08", "NTA\n\nWhen my 16yo daughter came out to me, I pretty much said the same thing and she laughed and asked how I knew. I told her we had known for years but were waiting for her to come out on her own and she was very happy with that. \n\nI hope it's just that your daughter was emotional as it's a huge moment to come out to a parent. My daughter cried a bit when she told me too, but we hugged and it was a great family moment. I'm knitting her a pride flag afghan for when she graduates high school this year (also a new laptop for college lol).", "NAH \n\nIt's tough to come out, so I think her emotional reaction is understandable. I think maybe you and her father didn't create as much of a clear, open environment where she would feel comfortable just bringing a gf home, so maybe you need to think about that more.\n\nShe needed to hear you accept her, and I think you should apologize for not reacting properly and express that even though you had an idea she was lesbian, you hope that she knows that you still love her just as much and accept her for who ah is.", "NTA mom. I think teen was just expecting shock and yes she is hurt that you didn't make it clear that you knew.  And she doesn't know how to handle your reaction, along with relief that nothing will change. Probably a little bit of everything. Just text her saying that if you hurt her you apologize, thats the last thing you wanted to do. And you're willing to hear her out and talk when she's ready and that you love her. I bet you she'll come around. You seem like a very good mom.", "The last thing I would've wanted was my mom saying \"honey I know you're a lesbian\" when I was a baby gay before I've had the chance to vocalize it, and while every kid is different, you absolutely were not wrong for NOT saying something sooner. I don't think you were the asshole in your response, you didn't say \"I know\" snidely, you were loving and accepting (as you should be!). She's processing lots of things here, and that's OK. NTA", "NTA, of course you knew you're her mother and you've paid attention to her over the years. It sucks that she was worried you wouldn't be supportive, but you've done nothing to suggest you would be angry. I think she's just a moody teen.", "NAH, but you should apologize to her for how blas\u00e9 you were. While you intended to come off as casual and supportive, what you actually ended up doing was downplaying how serious and important this is to her, and essentially reducing her entire identity down to a punchline. Your comments come off as incredibly dismissive. \n\nAs a queer person, my main advice for reacting to a coming out is to match the energy of the person coming out. If the other person is blas\u00e9 and casual, you can be blas\u00e9 and casual in turn. But if they\u2019re taking it seriously, then you also take it seriously. \n\nYour daughter went through a lot of struggle, internal strife, stress, and self discovery to come to terms with who she is and what that means for her in the world we live in. As she said: she was so stressed about it that she\u2019d have anxiety attacks. Your comment essentially took all of that struggle and all of that personal growth and reflection and said: \u201cso what? It was obvious to us already.\u201d \n\nMy vote is still NAH because you didn\u2019t intend it that way, and ultimately you\u2019re supportive of her, but please be aware of how it feels to her and her perspective on the matter.", "I think this is tough (also not gay or a parent myself I\u2019ll admit) because she had gotten herself all anxious and felt like this was a huge moment - she\u2019s decided this is the moment she comes out the closet and embraces her whole self and shares that with her family and it\u2019s nerve wracking but also potentially exciting - to her this is A. Big. Moment.\n\nAnd you\u2019re just like I know and have always known. So it\u2019s no longer a big moment it\u2019s just. A conversation. A let down. And feeling foolish because it was apparently so obvious.\n\n To me it mirrors how if a small child tells you something you don\u2019t tell them everyone knows that you\u2019re accept and share their surprise - because they just learned. She\u2019s just learned who she is - even if you feel you knew already dismissing that has left her feeling naturally \n\nMaybe we\u2019re slowly inching toward a society where nobody needs to come out - or everyone does and nobody is assumed straight! And the world being that accepting would make it better in my opinion \n\nBut in the mean time it\u2019s like the two of you are just seeing this as very different moments and you\u2019re of the view that you didn\u2019t need to be told and there was no reason for her to worry because you love her and not only felt like you knew this but also your love was never in any way dependant on her being anyone other than herself - but in trying to downplay it you\u2019ve stolen the good of the moment and all she had from anxiety and disappointment", "NAH. \n\nShe's a kid and doesn't understand a lot about a lot. Also full of emotions regardless of the situation. You couldn't have known how she felt, because she never shared it with you. And the whole world is telling her that she shouldn't be lesbian and her parents shouldn't love a lesbian kid and invalidating her sexuality, as well. Not to mention, people tend to make coming out seem like it should be this dramatic event for all involved. Either the parents traumatize their kids with homophobia or they're just over the moon and everybody is screaming and crying.\n\nShe didn't get either of those responses. \n\nI bet she feels small and invalidated and angry. Also, I hear that it is never helpful when a friend or parent says \"I know\". It seems dismissive or like you could see their disease all along and were looking for signs of something \"wrong\" or different..and you found them. \n\nBut, it also isn't helpful to just straight up and ask your kid if they're lesbian.. that wouldn've have been the right move either since she has had all  this anxiety and couldn't tell you herself. So that was an unfair expectation of you as well.\n\nMy mom probably knows I'm queer, she has asked me once but she's homophobic so I could never tell her. If I did, she would say \"I've known all along\" and it would annoy me because it's not about her knowing all along, it's about me telling her that I don't give a shit what she thinks lol.. But anyway, just talk to her about how she feels and let her know that you intention was to support her and love her. Not to invalidate her.", "NAH Her official coming out was a big moment for her, and you dismissed it. She wanted it to be an equally big thing for you too, probably involving hugs and I love yous. She built it up in her head and it turned out you already knew. You're N T A for how you reacted but it's understandable that she would have liked something else.", "NAH - I'm sure it had been consuming her for a bit and she's just dealing with the shock that she was worrying herself sick over nothing. It's a useful life lesson, be bold and don't hide yourself in fear.", "NTA but let\u2019s put it this way, I\u2019m guessing maybe 80% of kids parents do not react well so she\u2019s heard and read all the horror stories. She\u2019s psyched herself up for this big argument, this fight that she just knew was going to happen. However it did not happen, so she\u2019s upset because one she had all these things she worked up to say, rebutting everything. She planned it all. So that didn\u2019t happen you were very open and loving and accepting. So not what she expected. Also tell her you never wanted to say anything in case you were wrong. That you are happy she felt ready to tell you and her father, and that no matter what you both will always be proud of her, love her and accept her. \n\nAlso let her know that you know it had to be very scary to work up telling you guys this, that she probably expected a totally different response. That you are very happy and proud of her bravery for telling you and her father. No matter what we love you and look forward to meeting anyone you bring home in the future.", "NTA", "NTA there is so much pressure around 'coming out stories' and as a member of the bunch we don't think our parents will accept it and never consider the okay cool response. Your response was spot on. Your child just needs time to process it all. She will see later how lucky she is.", "There are two different ways to say you knew.\n\n\"oh honey, you know I always sort of suspected you might be, but I'm so glad you feel comfortable sharing this with me. I would hope you know that we will always support you, but I'm sure it was still scary putting it into words, so I just want to reassure you that we still love you and we're so proud of you\"\n\nThat says that you basically still knew while still being reassuring and understanding the emotions she just went through. But instead you said \"I know\". Which is basically \"yeah, already know, whatever, dont care\". That's not what you meant, but that's how someone in an already anxious state will interpret it. It's anticlimactic and a bit of a slap in the face. \n\nSo yeah YTA. You didn't mean to, but yeah, you kinda messed up.", "NTA.  Your daughter came out to you and you acknowledged.  Now she's mad because you \"let her worry\" for all that time?  Geez, she could have come out years ago.\n\nIt is not your job to read your daughter's mind; as with most parents, we're going to get it wrong sometimes.  In this case, you seem to be a considerate and loving mother.  So, she's mad bc you understand her?  I hope she overcomes this bump in the road.\n\nHere's embarrassing: my son is a very handsome, athletically inclined, and very smart guy.  In middle school, early high school I noticed he never seemed to take an interest \"romantically\" in anyone, male or female.  During this time, his sister in high school was dabbling with being Pan or Bi, or gay.  I also just waited and watched and made sure she was safe.  Although it was awkward me telling her that her current \"love interest\" couldn't stay in her room with the door closed or spend the night.  Luckily daughter told me about most of her relationships and I just said things like \"Okay, tell me more.\" or \"How do you feel about it.\"  Sister is now happily married.\n\nSo one night son & I were alone watching a movie, and I tried to very gently ask if he was gay.  He gave out a huge guffaw and laughed until he cried.  Okay, so his answer was \"No mom, I like girls.\"  In a year or so, he started dating a girl that he cared for very much.  So I felt a bit stupid, but it all came out all right.\n\nI tell you this bc as parents we can only do what we think is best in a gentle, loving way.  So I asked my son and he laughed in my face, you didn't ask you daughter and she's miffed that you didn't.  Were not going to get it right sometimes. Go figure!", "Unfortunately,  YTA.\nThe \"I know\" you threw in her face was just a way to reaffirm that you're smarter than her. Instead than listening,  you gave her your speech. Bad timing.\nThat moment required patience, compassion, understanding and especially, love. There was very little of those in your response", "NTA.  You didn\u2019t give her the dramatic experience and she is acting entitled because she has been robbed of her \u201corigin story\u201d. Give her an Oscar so that the drama Queen inside her will have her moment /s\n\nSeriously though, take her for family therapy, because she is going to grow distant from now on. Don\u2019t let this become a thing.", "Mild YTA - I\u2019ve been in your daughters position too. I was very obviously gay as a child & came out at 16 to parents who \u201calready knew\u201d. Here\u2019s the thing tho, this is HER news to share. What she wants to hear is \u201cthank you for sharing this with me. I\u2019m so glad you trust me with this part of your life. It\u2019s wonderful that you have figured this out of yourself\u201d\n\nRegardless of how obvious it is, her realizing she\u2019s gay may still have been a difficult process of self realization - I know it was for me.\n\nShe wants acknowledgment of how difficult that internal process was For Her. It\u2019s wonderful that you are very accepting & knew quickly. However, this is HER moment to tell you about HER self discovery. \n\nThis is her news to share, let it come from her!", "NAH.\n\nThere\u2019s a strong culture of expectation around how these conversations go and how everyone is anticipated to perform. There will be capital-C Crying, whether it\u2019s positive or negative. \n\nAlso, a huge part of teenage meaning-making is individuation, navigating conflict, and drama. The queer community online makes fully clear that being queer entitles you to expect all of those things.\n\nYour daughter has a loving, supportive parent who is totally unconcerned with her sexuality. The ideal situation. \n\nHowever, inheriting this ideal situation - nearly unimaginable to queer folks less than a generation ago - has opted her out of the queer identity narratives that are still popular, especially in teen spaces\u2026including the one that says that coming out will be a moment of drama, intensity, significance, and surprise that is tied up with her fundamental identity and her reveal to the world of who she is. Your daughter was born into a world too basically-friendly for that to be necessary or true, but it means something she expected to be interesting and important about herself is instead just as neutral as being straight\u2026and there is a *little* hopeful hoopla when you come out at sixteen that being gay means something more unusual or interesting than being straight.", "YTA.\n\n> I know.\n\n> Honey, you have gay written all over your face.\n\n\"No shit, sherlock, you look gay as fuck\" is really the best you could come up with?  How about something like, oh, I don't know, 'That's great, I'm glad you feel comfortable enough to tell me that.  I love you, and I always want you to feel comfortable with who you are, and that you can always talk to me.  Is this still private information?  What do you need from me to support you?'", "YTA but a soft one\n\nWe've read a few of this on AITA. It takes tremendous courage for them to come out, and hearing that the parent knew or doesn't care one way or the other is a huge let down.\n\nThe only thing to say when a child comes out is \"I love you and always will.\"\n\nThen you can tell them all the times you had hints. But give them their moment and allow them to be seen as they want to be seen, when they're inviting you to see them.\n\nMaybe ask for a do over?\n\nEDIT: Additional thought. You know how kids will tell you something fascinating they learned about a dinasaur or something? Is the answer \"I knew that.\" Or \"Oh, really? Tell me more.\" Coming out is way bigger and more personal than that, but you chose whether you invite them to tell you more about their discoveries or you shut them down. I think that's what happened here.", "NAH\n\nI mean, you were trying to be supportive, I get that. Don't beat yourself up because your daughter didn't get a dramatic reveal, if anything it shows how in tune you are with her that you already knew. \n\nHowever, the line about \"being gay is written all over your face\" deserves an apology. I don't think it's malicious, more like a throwaway line but it probably does sound to your daughter like she has a big flashing sign over her head that says \"lesbian\". Sit her down, give her a cuddle and apologise for your phrasing, reassure her that you only meant that you know her so well that you worked it out and that it doesn't mean everyone will automatically know.\n\nGood luck OP", "NTA\n\nYou couldnt have known what the best reaction was to give here. Some people prefer reactions like yours while others want their parents to make a bigger deal out of it [positively ofc].", "NTA but I think you could have handled this better.\n\nInstead of \"I know\" and then listing all these clues, you could have just said something like \"thank you for telling me, I love you\"\n\nAfter all, if you DID know, then you also know thst coming out - at any age - is *really* hard, and you should have respected her courage in doing so", "I\u2019m going to withhold judgment because I know you meant well and I can tell you love your daughter. Please apologize for the way you phrased your response and reaffirm that you\u2019ll support her no matter who she loves. I\u2019m very glad that you\u2019re so accepting and tolerant, but coming out is a really big deal for a queer person and she was obviously nervous about telling you - and your response was a bit flippant. Her anxieties are very valid and depending on where you live, she may not be accepted by everyone. You\u2019re not an asshole, but you could work on your external sensitivity toward your daughter\u2019s identity. Don\u2019t let this discourage you or harm your relationship. You can fix this. Good luck \u2764\ufe0f", "Nta\n\nMy son announced he was bi and I said 'I don't care', meaning I'm not homophobic, I'm not going to go off on one if I don't get grandchildren and anything else Iver ever heard of.  Since before he was born I said all I want is for him to have a happy life.  Status, money unimportant.\n\nI could see it wasn't the  response he was expecting, but I thought he was probably gay anyway. Then I said 'I really don't mind, it doesn't bother me'. Still not the right thing to say.  (to me either as his sexuality isn't really any of my business, it's his) \n\nTalk about digging a great big fcking hole. Then I asked 'what did you want me to say,?'\n\n\nStill not the right thing. I think 'it's fine by me' came out with an ever increasing discomfort. \n\nThen I tried to lighten the mood and said 'you still have to bag it' \n\nI still don't know what he was expecting of me.

It still stands I'll chase any bstd down that hurts him or mugs him off, I don't care who they are. \n\nNta", "Gentle YTA?\n\nI made a similar mistake in HS when a close friend came out to me.\n\nI\u2019d assumed it was pretty obvious, so obvious in fact that I sort of thought it was just a unstated fact, I pretended to be his date to dances and bearded him in our highly conservative town.\n\nApparently NOT.\n\nHe\u2019d been eaten alive thinking he\u2019d been \u2018stringing\u2019 me along for years, and finally worked up the courage to \u2018break up with me\u2019/\u2018break my heart\u2019.\n\nWe were both annoyed with the other. \n\nHe was annoyed that I\u2019d thought it was *so obvious* I was annoyed that he assumed I \u2018didn\u2019t know\u2019 and had been under the impression we were actually a \u2018couple\u2019.\n\nIt was a clusterfuck.\n\nWe got over it in time, but we were both salty for awhile.", "Even though I know that you meant well, your reaction makes YTA. It's wonderful that you're accepting and will love her the way she is! However, saying \"you have gay written all over your face\" isn't exactly comforting. She's a teenager who's already probably insecure about her appearance and sexuality.  Now she's gotta be wondering \"does EVERYONE look at me and instantly know I'm a lesbian?\" While some people might feel comfortable enough to just bring a partner home and introduce them, it can be really nerve-wracking as a queer person to do so, especially if you're young and not out to most people.\n\nAlso, she waited to tell you on her birthday, so she wanted it to be a special moment. Think about when you have an important piece of news and you're super nervous or excited to tell your loved ones. You want to see their reactions live so they can celebrate with you. If you came forward to make your happy announcement and your loved ones were just like, \"yeah, I know,\" I think your bubble would probably be burst.\n\nI'd recommend apologizing that you diminished her big moment and just emphasizing again that you love her no matter what. It will blow over and she'll be happy that you accept her regardless.", "NTA - I think there\u2019s nothing wrong with your response honestly. In fact, I think it\u2019s cute. You\u2019ve picked up on signs from your daughter over then years that of you what you know. I think saying something would have been dangerous, because like you said you could have been wrong.

I\u2019m sure you meant well and I\u2019m not saying her fear was warranted, but this isn\u2019t something you say to someone struggling with coming out.\n\nTelling you\u2019re clearly self conscious daughter that everyone can immediately tell she\u2019s gay, and then listing all the ways she wasn\u2019t able to hide it while she cries about people already knowing, seems unintentionally unkind.", "NAH\n\nMedia has conditioned baby gays that when they come out, it will be an extremely dramatic scene, for better or for worse, lots of crying, maybe some shouting. \n\nMaybe you could have hold back a little, but she was going to be disappointed with a neutral reaction of acceptance. \n\nCan't blame her, coming out \\*is\\* usually something really hard to do, even if you're 100% sure your parents will support you.\n\nJust give her time to cool off, she's probably annoyed she didn't got a Hallmark Moment out of her coming out.", "soft YTA, you meant no harm by it but \"I know\" isn't a fantastic response when someone comes out. and you did double down a bit on it even after she had a negative reaction, which i think was a bit callous.\n\ndon't take it personally though, or think you messed up big time. anxiety is hard, she went through a lot, i know what it's like. she's upset but i bet she'll laugh about it when she's 30.\n\nfor reference, my mom has told me that she knew i was gay since i was tiny for xyz reasons, but when I came out she made no mention of that--she just said it changed nothing and she still loved me. it really doesn't add anything or achieve anything to say \"i know already\" when someone is dropping what they think is a bomb on you", "NTA. You already knew what difference was it gonna make? If it took her all that to confess then yeah she\u2019s gonna be upset because that\u2019s just lent up fears and she will calm down.", "NTA I came out as bi to my mum and got a somewhat negative response of \"oh this is just a phase\" and \"you just want attention\" I worked with her for years to give her a more positive understanding and when my sister came out as bi it was met positively with a \"we know\" you didn't do anything wrong. I'd much rather have \"I already knew\" than what I got. And there's so many people that have been kicked out and shunned by their families for that. My dad beat me up when he found out. Don't let this people calling you the asshole get to you. You handled the situation well and positively.", "YTA, not much for saying you already knew more about how you downplayed the moment for her. It was something she had probably spent a long time planning and you could have worded it better.", "NAH. Everyone reacts differently to these moments. Your daughter had certain expectations about how this interaction would go, and instead it was wildly different and she didn't respond well to that.\n\nSome teens would respond well to how this interaction went. You were supportive and welcoming, but perhaps you could have made a bigger deal about how much it meant to you that she felt safe coming out to you, even though you had your suspicions.\n\nBut whatever it was that your daughter was looking for in her coming out, it wasn't what she got, and the only person who could tell you what she was looking for is her. When she's ready, I think it's time for a deep heart to heart when you're not distracted by cake, even if it's her cake.", "YTA, Learn how to spot when someone has put a lot of heart into something and match their energy instead of making it about you", "You\u2019re not an AH, you love and support your daughter which is how it should be! I think you just need to recognise what a big deal it was for her to \u201ccome out\u201d, even though you already knew. While it wasn\u2019t a big deal to you, it was still a big deal to her and caused her a lot of anxiety. I think you 2 just need to talk it over. NAH.", "YTA. She was clearly nervous and scared, it took a lot for her to tell you. When your first response is \"I know\" and then a list of reasons why it's obvious that could hurt. For one if you knew why didn't say anything? Doesn't mean saying \"I know you're a lesbian\" but saying things that would make her less worried. The other reason it could hurt is she may be scared that it's \"obvious\" to everyone. Which isn't always a good thing.\n\nYou could have said \"Thank you for letting me know, I love you\" and that would have been fine. You could have even said you had suspicions after first acknowleding that she came out. Because honestly you didn't know. She didn't confirm anything so you didn't know until she told you.", "NTA but I have a sneaking suspicion you didn\u2019t exactly make it clear that she was safe to come out to you. Hence the anxiety attacks. And then when you said you already knew? She probably is feeling a lot of complicated emotions right now, but some of the biggest are likely 1. Fear (if my parents already knew I was gay, even though I\u2019ve tried really hard to keep it under wraps, how many other people know without me telling them?? This is terrifying for many reasons), 2. Anger/frustration (if my parents knew the whole time, why did I have to feel so scared to come out? This is likely why she got mad you didn\u2019t ask her if she was gay and \u201cspare her\u201d from being anxious about coming out) and 3. She\u2019s likely been afraid and on edge for years, and those feelings don\u2019t magically dissipate the second you come out. She needs time to adjust! \n\nAlso, this might just be me, but aside from outright homophobia, \u201cI already knew\u201d is by far the most annoying reaction people have when I come out. Like sure, you clocked me! What do you want, a pat on the back? Validation? Why is me coming out to you suddenly all about how smart and perceptive YOU are, and how terrible I am at being in the closet? I have no idea why people think that telling me they already knew I was gay is reassuring, but it does the exact opposite! It makes me afraid that I\u2019m not closeting correctly, and might inadvertently be putting myself in danger when I enter an environment where it ISNT safe for me to be out. Other people will have different opinions on this, but personally, I vastly prefer it when people just say \u201cok cool\u201d and move on.", "NTA - Imagine how many kids out there go through actual hell because their parents are religious nightmares. I know one gay guy that his parents forced to go to a special school to get the gay \"removed\". The daughter will hopefully realize soon how lucky she has it.", "This is tough, and I think your heart is in the right place, but YTA. Personally, \u201cI know\u201d is not a great response, especially because she made her whole speech and was obviously nervous and scared. Leading with how you accept her for who she is and she can love whoever she wants would have been better, but what\u2019s done is done. Following up with multiple examples of how you knew is also a little weird, again she was obviously nervous and uncertain of how you would respond. Maybe this will go away on its own and she\u2019ll come to understand you weren\u2019t speaking from a place of malice, but I would talk to her and make it clear you didn\u2019t mean to be so dismissive, an apology wouldn\u2019t hurt here.", "NAH. I don\u2019t think you can be the AH when you clearly had good intentions. Your goal was to convey that you\u2019ve never cared whether she was straight or not, but I can see how she may be upset by the notion that either everyone knows her sexuality without her wanting them to or that others were aware of her identity before she was.\n\nWhen she\u2019s ready to talk, I think this should be a very doable conversation and it might be helpful to let her lead it. \u201cHey it seemed like you were upset when I said I had suspected you might like girls already. It wasn\u2019t my intention to upset you. I was hoping to make you feel more comfortable. Can we talk about what about that upset you so that I know how to handle things better in the future and can apologize properly?\u201d", "[deleted]", "NTA i was confused asf as to why shes angry until i read the comments your reaction definitely shocked her she will move on from it just give her some space but if i were you... when she finally came out to me i wouldve hugged her and let her how much i loved her and accepted her so much compassion wouldve came out of me because i know how hard it mustve been for her to tell me.", "YTA, this is a case where it would have been better to say \"I'm not surprised but I'm very happy you were brave enough to tell me.\" She feels a little humiliated now, and your jokey comment is a touch homophobic.", "NAH just give her space and maybe reiterate that you love and accept her unconditionally", "NTA", "im crying \"you have gay written all over your face\"\n\ni laugh now, but i've been out to my mom for 8 years. if she said that to my face when i came out to her, i probably would've been hurt or at least taken aback\n\nNTA, though. you didnt mean anything mean by it. & genuinely it's kinda funny lmao", "NTA. My child has come out to us, but we had  always let them know that we love them no matter who they choose to love.", "She probably wanted her coming out to be SO much more emotional. NTA", "YTA\n\nWhen you're anxious about coming out, it can be a big comfort to know you're hiding your \"secret\" well and nobody knows what you're anxious about people knowing about you. You took that sense of security and stomped it. When someone is out and proud, \"you have 'gay' written all over your face\" can be an amazing affirmation. What your daughter heard was \"you're terrible at hiding this and everyone you meet immediately knows you're a lesbian.\"", "NAH but why didn't you guys talk about your attitudes and experiences with  sexuality and gender etc with your daughter so she was comfortable with this?\n\nI'm a parent who was in a similar situation a few years ago. My husband and I decided to be upfront with our daughters early on and say to both of them that we loved them no matter their sexuality, gender etc. Then proceeded to keep the conversation alive, with discussions around friends and celebrities. So when our 17f came out as pansexual, it wasn't dramatic and she knew we would be happy for her.", "NTA. She was probably expecting a bigger reaction and had prepared herself for it. Your reaction has thrown her and she needs some time to collect her thoughts. Don't hover, just be there when she's ready.", "NAH.  You knew. Parents sometimes know. She obviously had expected some giant lovely coming out moments that she didn't get.  I'm sure there are a million children out there that would have loved to hear what you said from their parents.", "LMAO, she is a teen. What is teen life without drama. NTA, you did fine.  Good job mom. \ud83d\udc4d", "NTA", "NTA, she's probably just recovering from such a massive wave of emotion that was this interaction.", "If you suspected for years, you had a long time to learn the appropriate response to your child coming out to you based on countless stories from others. \"I know\" was never it. People don't like when you make assumptions about them and then you listed all the assumptions you'd ever made about her. YTA.", "NAH.", "Maybe the daughter was unconsciously dreaming of an emotional movie-like moment, a thing she would talk of as a defining moment in her life.", "I\u2019m not gay, so I don\u2019t feel comfortable giving a judgement, but you articulated what I was thinking. There was a time I thought my teen might be gay, but I couldn\u2019t have ever imagined saying something to her. I\u2019m sure that would have been worse than this situation. (Especially since she\u2019s not.)

So when you said 'i know' what she heard was you dismissing the personal difficulty she's had soul searching, figuring herself out and her fear of those hostilities.     \n\n\nJust keep reaching out and loving her and make it clear that her personal struggles and insights are profoundly interesting to you.  Just like her favorite dinosaur when she was four.", "\"I'm really glad you felt safe and comfortable to tell me this and I'm proud of you, no matter who you love.\"\n\nHow's that for a statement of unconditional love and support?", "This is also a saying in some places and doesn\u2019t always mean like \u201cyou look gay\u201d.

Status, money unimportant.", "What? I know coming out is hard and emotional. But it should never be a moment that can be \"ruined\" by a parent already knowing or at least guessing especially if she still gets all the love. Getting an \"i know\" from someone who loves you and still does is great. It's a huge relief. You may be all over the place with your feelings, but having your mom leaving the moment of your coming out in your own hands despite already guessing so is the best thing she can do. It's reassuring that she still absolutely loves and supports you.", "that's so dramatic... chill", ">\"you're terrible at hiding this and everyone you meet immediately knows you're a lesbian.\"\n\nOh, seeing it from that perspective, I feel terrible. \n\nIm not sure how out of the closet she is.

She knew it was an assumption so she waited for her daughter to address it when she was ready. \n\nThere\u2019s nothing inherently wrong with \u201cI know.\u201d It shows the mother had made the assumption and continued (presumably) loving and supporting her daughter exactly the same\u2026 to the point the daughter didn\u2019t know the mom knew.", "It\u2019s not a bad thing not every coming out story needs to be dramatic or anything. Our society has become so progressive that it\u2019s becoming less of a big deal to come out with all the love and support we received.

I\u2019m not saying there aren\u2019t people out there who will still not accept their kids unfortunately but getting this reaction is a lot better than any negative reaction you can ever get.", "Yup. I mean who didn't as a baby queer? Picture the hallmark moment where you come out to Mum/dad/person, they hug you and tell you immediately with tears how brave you are and how proud they are? \nAnd on the other side of that that even if you have a great relationship with your parents that you've totally misjudged and they'll reject you and you'll lose everything.\nIt's a huge emotional release.", "Because they\u2019re children!

I myself did this to a friend years ago. What I felt like I was conveying was \"I knew and it didn't matter to me,\" but a few years later he told me how upsetting it was (because we met at work and he didn't feel safe being out at work).  This is one of those situations where you're obviously not an asshole overall, it's just a wording thing that it's always obvious to those of us who don't have this kind of anxiety. It's obvious from this post you love her.", "It also suggests that gay people look a certain way. Not a good thing to say to a self conscious and anxious teen.

I\u2019m glad you have seen it and absorbed it!\n\nThat being said, OP, your heart was in the right place but the word choice could\u2019ve been a little better, which is why, gently, YTA. Adding on to what u/madelinegumbo said, your response may have came across as invalidating in a way. You may have meant for your nonchalance to come across as encouraging, but to your daughter it could be seen as a betrayal.\n\nMembers of the LGBT+ community feel intense pressure in terms of coming out because not everyone in their lives will be supportive and, in some cases, those individuals may react violently. It\u2019s understandable that your daughter feels that all the anxiety and pressure she felt was for nothing and that, as such, she feels betrayed. \n\nI hope you and your daughter can sit down and have another conversation about things. Good luck to both of you!", "Were you anxious before you came out to them? \n\nIf not, that changes the whole situation. This girl was clearly very anxious, and in that moment she needed reassurance, and didn't get it. Of course negative reactions are worse, but this was still not a good way gor OP to communicate and support her daughter in this situation.", "Exactly. I don't think it's something inherently bad, in some ways it's just like having expectations for your wedding day; but, sometimes, from high expectations can come great disappointments.", "I had never considered your point about feeling secure about being able to hide your secret.  That is probably why the daughter is so upset in this case.\n\nThis is likely a sensitive topic since it sounds like she thought she was \"fitting in\". I do not think that makes the mother the asshole here.  If anything it shows that her mother is someone who is willing to keep her daughter's secrets and let her reveal them to others at a time of her choosing.\n\nThe daughter is likely going through a series of emotions about being relieved she has come out to her parents, but also concerned others she did not intent to know may also be aware.  But that is not something that the mother did. She is now aware that she was not as successful at keeping that part of her identity  a secret as she though.  \n\nShe could use that info in any number of ways, but being upset at the mother is not the rational outlet for that.", "I wasn\u2019t because my family has been always open and yeah it\u2019s kind of difficult when your pan and a male but it didn\u2019t matter because I also didn\u2019t really hide my feelings either. I can understand she was and she\u2019s not the asshole because she\u2019s a child and growing up and learning about herself. She did receive the love and support from her parents and looking back she\u2019s see how her parents accepted her long before she realized who she was because they love her no matter what", "I don't think OP is generally an asshole. It seems clear that she loves and supports her daughter. It's just this comment likely targeted her daughter's insecurities and I don't think the daughter is an asshole for being hurt by the comment. She's a teenager, she was feeling especially vulnerable, and she was basically met with \"Yeah, everyone knows already.\""]}
