{"id": 28077, "submission_id": "16xwdck", "title": "AITA for reporting my client to the RSPCA?", "selftext": "I\u2019m (39f) a specialist dog trainer & have been working with dogs for over 18 years now. I have 2 dogs of my own (1 Shiba Inu & 1 Samoyed). I\u2019ve also been doing 1 on 1 training classes for years now.\n\nI recently had a young couple ask for my assistance in helping train their dog to go to the toilet outside. This didn\u2019t really seem too weird to me as I\u2019ve been training for almost 2 decades & have met many first time owners who need help doing simple training (e.g toilet training, recall, not jumping at strangers).\n\nThis was much worse than I thought. They had bought a \u201cpomsky\u201d (half Siberian husky, half pomeranian) as their first dog, which I said wasn\u2019t a great first move as this dog has 2 of the most hard to train breeds mixed into one. It was also very clear that this was people buying a dog only for aesthetic reasons & that they have no idea of how to care for one.\n\nI still tried to help them, I had 6 sessions with them and I had to repeatedly show them how to make their dog go to the toilet outside as they kept letting it pee & poop in the house and just cleaning it afterwards. The only thing they were doing to prevent it is putting the dog in the garden each time she did, which wasn\u2019t going to do anything. Keep in mind this is also a puppy, not an adult dog.\n\nThey refused to buy a crate yet wondered why their dog would cover the floor in pee & feces every time they left it alone. They wouldn\u2019t tell me why, just kept asking for \u201cother solutions\u201d as they didn\u2019t want to get one. They wouldn\u2019t stop their dog from chasing their rabbit so they started keeping the rabbit in its cage at all times and never letting it out.\n\nNot only did I have enough as they weren\u2019t taking any of my advice or training their dog at all, but I started to feel guilty and sad for their dog as it\u2019s not the dogs fault & also very bad for their rabbit. I never thought I\u2019d ever do this, but I ended up calling the RSPCA and reporting them for animal neglect. \n\nThat was only a week ago and since then they have informed me that they have had their dog taken from them (they didn\u2019t say anything about the rabbit) and were upset. I lost my cool for a moment and told them that it was a good thing because they clearly weren\u2019t making any progress & now the dog can hopefully find some owners who know what they\u2019re doing & have a happy life. Of course (I already knew it wouldn\u2019t) this didn\u2019t go well and they worked out that I was the one who reported them after I said that. I didn\u2019t deny it, & said that as a specialist dog trainer I can\u2019t sit back & watch a dog be neglected without any change. \n\nSince then they\u2019ve posted multiple posts against me on socials, they\u2019ve been messaging people who follow me to not trust me. I had a client ask for their money back as they were \u201cscared I\u2019d take their dog away\u201d.\n\nI\u2019m scared of losing my clients and my business being ruined. But I think I did the right thing as these people weren\u2019t improving & were neglecting their dog. AITA?\n\nEdit because I wasn\u2019t able to put some info in due to the character limit \u2014 Some people seem to think that the problem I had was that they just weren\u2019t getting a crate or because they were taking too long to toilet train it. That\u2019s not the case at all. They wouldn\u2019t take their dog out frequently enough or for long enough walks to even give it the opportunity to go to the toilet outside (they would take the dog for 3 walks a day MAX and only for around 20 mins at a time). They would leave the dog alone for hours in the house and then constantly complain about their floor being covered in feces and pee when they got home. They refused to act on any solutions I gave, and didn\u2019t change anything since I started helping them. When they would catch their dog in the act of pooping indoors, the only action they ever took was putting the dog out in the garden for a couple minutes & giving the dog a light tap on the nose. I would never call the RSPCA on someone simply just for not having a crate. \n\nAlso no, I didn\u2019t just contact the RSPCA and they took the dog away like that. They would never take a pet away from someone just by someone\u2019s word, they will always do their own investigation into the situation and act from what they have observed. The fact that they took the dog away wasn\u2019t because of something I said, it was because they observed themselves that it wasn\u2019t an acceptable environment for the dog. Yet again, I wasn\u2019t able to put details about how they did their own investigation because of the character limit.\n\nThanks to everyone who has understood what I needed to do, I feel a lot better about my choice now. And thank you for the advice of how to handle them slandering my work just because their pup got taken off them. Let this be a message to everyone to do your research on caring for a dog before getting one, they\u2019re a lot harder work than most people think.", "created_utc": 1696252511, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16xwdck/aita_for_reporting_my_client_to_the_rspca/", "score": 49, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I am aware that a former client, who declined to follow any of the advice I was providing and was struggling with the dog, subsequently  either had the dog removed or chose to surrender it.

Animals are only removed where the owners have broken the Animal Welfare Act.* \n\n*I don't know the circumstances in which the dog in question was removed, or even whether it was removed, or whether the owners agreed to surrender it.  I wish to be clear that in any situation where I became concerned about a dog I was training, I would always talk to the owner to discuss those concerns and to work with them to help address any problems.  if you have any concerns at all about my work with you or your dog, I would be more than happy to discuss this with you.*", "NTA. You clearly saw the issue with the owners and reported the dog for its own safety.

They mistreated a dog to the point it got taken away. You work with animals, their welfare is always your priority", "NTA but unless you post your side of the story (without naming names) the only story out there is your horrible client's one. \n\nYou did the right thing by getting that puppy out of their house.

I have no idea how the RSPCA conducts this sort of thing. Is there an investigation into the claims that are made?\n\nNTA. They must have seen something they didn't like and needed to take the pup away immediately.

Lawyer up and send a cease and desist.", "NTA and good on you for sticking to your principles, in a world where not many do.  If they are shit-posting on your business social media, then the only thing that you can do is to post the \u2018business owner\u2019s right to reply\u2019 and also perhaps a generic statement on your Facebook feed about the situation, most people will understand. Try keep it short and to the point though. Owners ignoring trainers advice, dog kept in poor conditions, no effort to change or improve. Other animals at risk etc.", "NTA\n\nYou had concerns and reported them. If the RSPCA were that worried they had to take the dog away then clearly this was a dire situation.

You took a situation into your own hands that's none of your business. unless the animals are being harmed it's fine. the rabbit should have had a big enough cage if it was permanently caged, which is also fine to do, and like you said the dog was a puppy, they can take a while to potty train especially boy dogs. you removed their pet and possibly got blacklisted from getting more all because you acted like you were too good and on a high horse. honestly, if you did that to me I'd make other people aware of what you did too. I wouldn't want other people to lose their dog because you decided they weren't fit owners. you even said they cleaned up after the dog... so it's not like anyone was living in biohazard. you are ridiculous, now that dog is actually being neglected because the RSPCA is overrun and understaffed instead of at home and loved. good job OP", "I\u2019m torn with this one.
