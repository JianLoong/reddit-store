It was pretty brutal and she essentially told me she was bored of me. It hurt me a lot and to compensate I drank a load. I\u2019ve been drinking a lot and in a black out state in a nightclub I kissed one of her friends. They weren\u2019t super close but I know she would be hurt if she knew. I also think I have no legs to stand on if she did something similar now. The girl I kissed didn\u2019t know we broke up and asked me if I felt bad. Which I kinda do right now.
