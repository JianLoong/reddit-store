Instead, she had to keep pushing until the OP justifiably checked her ass.  I just hope there were witnesses to enjoy the scene.", "NTA.

Some people like that little kick in the pants to be social. Some people really do not.  Sammy would benefit from learning to be able to tell the difference.", "Question: Why does your SIL think of your sister Beth as an outsider at a family event?", "NTA \n\nSam\u2019s tactics was to force Beth. She lacked understanding and it wasn\u2019t mutual. She basically stalked her and did not take no for an answer. Gosh these people are annoying.", "NTA - boundaries exist for people like Sammy. Being nice means respecting the wishes of others and letting people vibe in their own space. It is NOT following others around when they\u2019d rather be alone and then complaining that no one appreciates how nice you are when your behavior speaks to the opposite. \n\nSammy isn\u2019t nice by virtue or practice, she\u2019s nice for validation. That\u2019s toxic behavior and I would encourage her to dive into why she needs this. Pharisee behavior.", "NTA\nThere\u2019s a meme that was going around a while back that said something like \u201cif you are doing something you think is nice and pleasant for someone who doesn\u2019t want or like it you are spreading negativity in the world\u201d I feel like it was aimed at the stereotypical nice guy who tries to push himself on a woman and then gets mad she doesn\u2019t appreciate it, but it fits here too.\n\nIt\u2019s not nice to push past peoples boundaries, it\u2019s not nice to chase people down and talk with them when they want silence and peace. Thank you for trying to help this person understand that.", "NTA and as a person with an extremely low social battery I feel for your sister. Luckily my family knows how I am and don't bat an eyelash when I disappear to another room with a book and Diet Coke for a couple hours.", "NTA. She isn't being nice. She's being performative. Sammy doesn't understand that people aren't vending Machines. There's no magic formula where you put in Nice Tokens and after so many you get ~~the sex~~ a friend.\n\nTell her she's being like those incels who are confused when they bring a woman they are interested in flowers and chocolates and Saying the Right things, why isn't the woman giving them anything?! Ignoring the fact that the woman has made it clear they have *zero* interest in that person.\n\nShe's not bothering to form a *genuine* relationship and with an introvert like Beth, that isn't going to work. It's going to have the opposite affect! If Sammy wants and is okay with superficial relationships, there's nothing wrong with that. But she needs to understand that she's *not* going to make friends with everyone and that there are people who will *not* want to make friends with her. And that's okay. Some people just don't naturally get on with each other.", "Nta, you could\u2019ve been a little nicer but you are definitely not the asshole.", "NTA unfortunately it\u2019s probably not the last this\u2019ll be an issue if anything she\u2019ll be worse at the next family gathering", "NTA\n\nBeth is not an outsider, she is a permanent member of her family of origin, fully loved and accepted exactly as she is. \n\nSammy is the outsider trampling boundaries to try finagle her way into being a central character.", "ESH.

It was up to Beth to deal with the situation in her own way, she didn't ask you to step in for her, and by doing so it sounds like you made the situation worse.

It doesn\u2019t make sense for me, she is our sister of course she is family, and not an outsider", "NTA. Sammy has been told to leave Beth alone and the situation has been explained to her multiple times before, it sounds like someone had to put their foot down and you did. Sammy needs to learn that people are different and being included a being comfortable means different things to different people. She was literally trying to be \u2018nice\u2019 by showing Beth that what she wants doesn\u2019t matter. If someone needs to have a moment to themselves, let them! It\u2019s not a hard concept.", "Would you respect someone who, with full knowledge of what they were doing, repeatedly bothered someone who needed space and politely ask to be left alone?", "Sammy is a bully and needs to learn to leave poor Beth alone.", "Did you read the OP? It says Sammy followed Beth around and wouldn\u2019t leave her alone even after being asked multiple times.", ">she is our sister of course she is family, and not an outsider\n\nMore importantly, you respect your sisters boundaries, and what she is comfortable with. You guys are doing great, SIL not so much", "Or possibly, she is being a bully", "There's a world of difference between disapproval of someone's behaivour, and disapproval of the person. OP has shown the latter in her first paragraph. \n\nCalling Sammy out for her behaviour is fine. Calling her a stereotype, not so much. OP is YTA.", "Are your opinions of people not shaped by their behavior?", "Oh, indeed. And then I characterise them by their behaviour without concurrently denigrating them, unlike OP.", "NTA as a Beth-type person. \n\nWe don't know what Sammy's motivations are. Maybe she actually is trying to reach out and be nice. Maybe she wants social credit for being the extrovert trying to \"help\" an introvert. Maybe she's just someone who likes to push boundaries. But it doesn't matter for two reasons   \n1) Beth made it very clear that she wants to be left alone, and told Sammy to go away. That's as clear cut of a boundary as you can get   \n2) Sammy is the one that started bitching to YOU. If you had sought her out, it might be a different story, but Sammy opened Pandora's box and then got mad that stuff came out.", "NTA", "NTA. Sammy sounds like that annoying person at a wedding that tries to get everyone on the dance floor to a degree that is ridiculous. I would be careful popping her bubble though. I\u2019ve met lots of people in my life like this and they are generally not very healthy. They live in an idealized bubble (your Disney mention was spot on) and often if that is the case, she likely can\u2019t cope with reality. You stopped being the SIL from her model family toy set. So be prepared for her to die on this hill.", "NTA/YTA: not the a-hole for telling her to back off Beth. But a-hole for the delivery. \n\nI'd reach out again and explain that Beth is not like her and does not want or need her attention. I would also say that everybody else knows how to treat Beth and when she doesn't everyone sees that she is out of touch with the rest of the family. Pitch it is a thing that by doing this to Beth she is the weirdo outsider who is being socially awkward. Play up the idea that this is not how popular, perfect people do things.", "> Basically treat her like a cat, Sammy knows this.\n\nLol. Love this logic. Anyone familiar with cats know that they have strong boundaries and will absolutely let you know when they\u2019re upset.", "NTA - Sounds like Sammy needs some empathy training. Introverts and many people on the spectrum get overwhelmed with the number of stimuli, especially at larger gatherings. I was recently at a wedding and a family member went into the bride's room to lower their level of stimulation and regroup for a bit. Everyone understood.", "My mom does this, if you're quiet she feels the need to force conversation by asking you a million random questions. Then thinks people are rude for not asking her a bunch of questions when really they're just trying not to engage her. When she gets like that it feels like an interrogation instead of a conversation. Her theory is that it's polite to ask people about themselves but doesn't realize it feels like you're being grilled and that can make people even more uncomfortable or anxious.", "she understands.  She doesn't care because she always needs an audience.  Everyone should carry a flashlight to shine on SIL at all times.", "So to get this straight. Beth is the way she is and everyone must accept that. But no one wants to accept Sammy the way she is and she should change? Have I got that right?", "NTA. Pushing social contact when it's known to be unwanted is the literal definition of harassment in a lot of places. Harassment isn't \"nice\".", "NTA. The Golden rule is \u201ctreat people how you want to be treated\u201d but it should be \u201ctreat people how /they/ want to be treated\u201d.", "NTA SIL is using \"nice\" as an excuse to bully your sister. Where the heck is your brother in this? He should be stepping in here.", "NTA  Sammy is a rampaging extrovert with no sympathy for introverts like Beth and no respect for them either.  She deserved to be told that because she obviously thinks she can do no wrong. I wouldn't have been that nice to Sammy.", "NTA\n\nSammy suffers from the iconic inability to understand introversion that is sadly common place among extroverts. Beth engages for a bit but eventually wants a bit of peace and quiet, and this is perceived as either offensive by Sammy, or like Beth is some how some sad lost pathetic little pup in need of further inclusion. Never mind that Beth is an adult, or at least old enough to know what she wants out of social engagement and how much of it she wants.\n\nSammy having a jolly little rant and disrespecting Beth's boundaries while framing herself as some kind of hero for it makes her a massive asshole.", "NTA She is boundary stomping and trying to justify it as she's just being nice! If someone says no, leave them alone, you leave them alone! Also why the heck is your SIL saying that your sister is an outsider at your family event?!?!?", "NTA. Your SIL isn\u2019t being polite. She\u2019s being incredibly rude.", "She's saying your sister is an outsider? WTH? NTA", "'Tropes' are things that happen in fiction, not things that describe real people", "Honestly I wouldn't respect her either if she didn't know how to respect people's boundaries. It's a one thing to be sociable it's another to force interaction on another person, especially when they tell you they need some space or make it clear in other ways. Sammy is not to be pitied.", "She sounds attention-seeking to me. Beth can't muster half a fuck about her so she takes it as an affront, and tries to coax a reaction out of her, even if a bad one.", "If she is kind as she is 'ranting' she is then she really isn't a nice person at all.\n\nShe consistently crosses and ignores Beth boundaries, as a shy person myself I would hate that. But many times Beth told her to stop and Sammy 'did not'.\n\nAnother is a very very key word here. Sammy wants to include an 'outsider in an family event'. Sammy sees herself as a core family and sees the sister as just an outsider to the family she married into. What kind of mean girl act is that? Even if she does have good intentions that line right that irks me.", "She became a real AH when she called your sister an \u201coutsider\u201d", "Sammy seems to think she\u2019s responsible for people having what SHE thinks is a good time.", "Sounds like an extreme version of the extrovert Sammy harassing the introvert Beth. Sammy has to be \"on\" all the time while Beth needs to switch off and be alone for a few hours to recharge her social battery."]}
