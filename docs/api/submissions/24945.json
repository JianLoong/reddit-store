Had Sammy listened to any of the numerous times when she was told about Beth\u2019s boundaries, or even just read the room at any point, everything would have been just peachy.   Instead, she had to keep pushing until the OP justifiably checked her ass.  I just hope there were witnesses to enjoy the scene.", "NTA. She was being disrespectful of Beth\u2019s boundaries and wishes. Forcing herself on people isn\u2019t inclusive, it\u2019s rude.", "NTA\n\n> Sammy wouldn\u2019t leave Beth alone.

Some people like that little kick in the pants to be social. Some people really do not.  Sammy would benefit from learning to be able to tell the difference.", "Question: Why does your SIL think of your sister Beth as an outsider at a family event?", "NTA \n\nSam\u2019s tactics was to force Beth. She lacked understanding and it wasn\u2019t mutual. She basically stalked her and did not take no for an answer. Gosh these people are annoying.", "NTA - boundaries exist for people like Sammy. Being nice means respecting the wishes of others and letting people vibe in their own space. It is NOT following others around when they\u2019d rather be alone and then complaining that no one appreciates how nice you are when your behavior speaks to the opposite. \n\nSammy isn\u2019t nice by virtue or practice, she\u2019s nice for validation. That\u2019s toxic behavior and I would encourage her to dive into why she needs this. Pharisee behavior.", "NTA\nThere\u2019s a meme that was going around a while back that said something like \u201cif you are doing something you think is nice and pleasant for someone who doesn\u2019t want or like it you are spreading negativity in the world\u201d I feel like it was aimed at the stereotypical nice guy who tries to push himself on a woman and then gets mad she doesn\u2019t appreciate it, but it fits here too.\n\nIt\u2019s not nice to push past peoples boundaries, it\u2019s not nice to chase people down and talk with them when they want silence and peace. Thank you for trying to help this person understand that.", "NTA and as a person with an extremely low social battery I feel for your sister. Luckily my family knows how I am and don't bat an eyelash when I disappear to another room with a book and Diet Coke for a couple hours.", "NTA. She isn't being nice. She's being performative. Sammy doesn't understand that people aren't vending Machines. There's no magic formula where you put in Nice Tokens and after so many you get ~~the sex~~ a friend.\n\nTell her she's being like those incels who are confused when they bring a woman they are interested in flowers and chocolates and Saying the Right things, why isn't the woman giving them anything?! Ignoring the fact that the woman has made it clear they have *zero* interest in that person.\n\nShe's not bothering to form a *genuine* relationship and with an introvert like Beth, that isn't going to work. It's going to have the opposite affect! If Sammy wants and is okay with superficial relationships, there's nothing wrong with that. But she needs to understand that she's *not* going to make friends with everyone and that there are people who will *not* want to make friends with her. And that's okay. Some people just don't naturally get on with each other.", "Nta, you could\u2019ve been a little nicer but you are definitely not the asshole.", "NTA unfortunately it\u2019s probably not the last this\u2019ll be an issue if anything she\u2019ll be worse at the next family gathering", "NTA\n\nBeth is not an outsider, she is a permanent member of her family of origin, fully loved and accepted exactly as she is. \n\nSammy is the outsider trampling boundaries to try finagle her way into being a central character.", "ESH. Sammy should respect boundaries, you shouldn\u2019t be speaking for another adult and calling someone a bitch on your sister\u2019s behalf. Let Beth handle her own issues. It might help her develop some confidence. She\u2019s going to have to deal with people in her life that won\u2019t understand she needs to be treated like a cat\u2026", "ESH (except Beth). It was up to Beth to deal with the situation in her own way, she didn't ask you to step in for her, and by doing so it sounds like you made the situation worse. Not your place to act like that or step in unless you're invited to. You made this situation all about yourself instead of about Beth, which is an AH thing to do.", "How very little respect you have for Sammy. \n\nYTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
