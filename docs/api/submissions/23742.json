Everyone in our family, my sister parents and myself, thought they were a perfect match. Emma was very polite, well educated, had a great family whom we had met a few times, and was head over heels for Matt.\n\nFast forward to three months ago, and Emma finds out Matt cheated on her with this other woman, Cindy (F25). Needless to say, the marriage has been called off, and everyone has been beyond angry with Matt.\n\nOur parents haven't spoken to Matt since the fallout of what's happened, and even I have only spoken to him twice (each call lasting less than 5 minutes) since then. Our sister has also not spoken with him either.\n\nThis morning, I received a call from Matt saying that he wanted to reconcile with the family. He mentioned how upset and depressed he's been since making \"the worst mistake of his life\" and how much he regrets his actions. I was listening up until this point, but got annoyed when he started mentioning how also Cindy wants to meet our parents and the rest of us.\n\nHe told me that he left our parents a voicemail a few days ago, but they haven't responded, and that he feels isolated from our family. I point blank told him that he only had himself to blame for this and that he clearly didn't think what he did was a mistake since he was still with Cindy.\n\nHe said he just wanted us to give them a chance, but I told him I had to go to work and left the call while he was finishing a sentence as I was very frustrated with him.\n\nAITA?\n\n**UPDATE - More context**: For everyone suggesting that Matt found his true love in Cindy. That's questionable from my perspective. He still claims his current relationship with her is a mistake, and I'm fairly certain he has said as much to her in the past.\n\n**UPDATE 2** \u2013 After reading some of the comments and doing some self-reflection, I have decided to reach out to my brother. It's true; he's done something terrible, and there is simply no other way of seeing it. However, despite the disappointment, I still do feel that I have a responsibility towards him at this low point in his life, especially considering that my parents and sister probably won't be reaching out to him.\r\n\nI called him (the call lasted about 20 minutes) and offered to meet him in person, which did seem to cheer him quite a bit. I, however, made it abundantly clear to him that I have no interest in meeting Cindy.\r\n\nAt this point, he said something that confirmed my suspicions on what he thinks of Cindy but was still pretty surprising to hear him say. He told me that he's open to the idea of dumping Cindy if it helps build back his relationship with our parents and sister.\r\n\nWhen I asked him if he was sure about that, he said that she was \"small-time\" and that she \"knew the risks\" of getting into a relationship with him so her feelings would be on her.\n\nThis whole situation sucks, and I don't even know what to feel or think about it anymore.\r", "created_utc": 1691006955, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15gjc8l/aita_for_telling_my_depressed_brother_he_only_has/", "score": 3174, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Give me a break. The kind of person who does what he did is the kind of person who is morally bankrupt in general. It\u2019s not like, oh he had a bad day one time and didn\u2019t hold the door for someone at a store. He showed he is incapable of standing by his life commitments. But he didn\u2019t JUST betray his fianc\u00e9; he showed very clearly to everyone around him what kind of person he is.

IDK how you can be an asshole and petty about this if you're not Emma.\n\nWhy are you all so invested in his love life? Emma was not his perfect match. He did not like Emma.

You've got to grow up and accept that.", "that's what he deserves. actions have consequences.", "So even if he was still single, the family wouldn't be interested in taking to him? So he is being disowned for cheating once. I don't think that's wrong, everyone has different levels of tolerance for cheating, but I think it's important to frame it as what it is. Never talking to your child or brother again when they cheated on their partner is going further than most would go, but I don't think it would make you an asshole. Personally I would consider if the crime deserves a lifetime of being cut off from your entire family.

Like sure cheating is a no go immediate relationship ended in my eyes but I wouldn\u2019t want her to face this world alone. I mean hell i loved  (and would probably still love) her. Just because she did something that made me want to be no constancy means I hate her and want her to be ruined. Folks are too black and white with this stuff.  Being cheated on sucks hardcore.

You decide to travel to the clandestine location you've selected and/or let them into your home. You decide to take off your clothes. You decide to put on a condom (at least I sure hope you do).

And while his family was harmed by his actions indirectly it just seems unhealthy in my head to put them in the same boat as Emma, particularly when renewing their relationships with the clear communication of how they were hurt by his actions as well may be part of what helps Matt be a better person. And seeing as western society has isolated people so deeply that family is the last refuge of support most people have maybe there is some obligation on their part to... if nothing else layout a sense of what they would need to move forward.\n\nI guess my point is more of, ostracizing someone is social death, it's one of the more extreme punishments we have short of physical violence and in my mind Emma is entitled to that, but Matt's family isn't as much.

Any assessment of Matt's character must include his affair.\n* *\"You shouldn't disown family over this/at all.\"* Part of being a good person means being consistent. If you consider something truely evil but give your friends or family a free pass when they commit it because you like their company, then you're not a good person. A lot of parents say that, if their son committed a murder, they'd help said son hide the body and lie to the police about their kid being innocent. That's not good or moral.\n* *\"He didn't cheat on you/it's not your business.\"* This also falls under the point about how good people need to be consistent. If you only care about evil acts when they hurt you directly, then you're not really a good person. It's also an impractical stance, because a person who'll hurt others is more likely to hurt you.\n* *\"The mistress is Matt's true love/Matt and his ex's relationship probably had flaws\"*. Guess what? There's no good excuse for cheating. Matt could have called off the relationship *before* getting romantically involved with someone else.\n\nIf you're going to defend Matt, just admit that you'd prefer if cheaters got away scot-free.
