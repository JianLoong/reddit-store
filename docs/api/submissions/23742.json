Everyone in our family, my sister parents and myself, thought they were a perfect match. Emma was very polite, well educated, had a great family whom we had met a few times, and was head over heels for Matt.\n\nFast forward to three months ago, and Emma finds out Matt cheated on her with this other woman, Cindy (F25). Needless to say, the marriage has been called off, and everyone has been beyond angry with Matt.\n\nOur parents haven't spoken to Matt since the fallout of what's happened, and even I have only spoken to him twice (each call lasting less than 5 minutes) since then. Our sister has also not spoken with him either.\n\nThis morning, I received a call from Matt saying that he wanted to reconcile with the family. He mentioned how upset and depressed he's been since making \"the worst mistake of his life\" and how much he regrets his actions. I was listening up until this point, but got annoyed when he started mentioning how also Cindy wants to meet our parents and the rest of us.\n\nHe told me that he left our parents a voicemail a few days ago, but they haven't responded, and that he feels isolated from our family. I point blank told him that he only had himself to blame for this and that he clearly didn't think what he did was a mistake since he was still with Cindy.\n\nHe said he just wanted us to give them a chance, but I told him I had to go to work and left the call while he was finishing a sentence as I was very frustrated with him.\n\nAITA?\n\n**UPDATE - More context**: For everyone suggesting that Matt found his true love in Cindy. That's questionable from my perspective. He still claims his current relationship with her is a mistake, and I'm fairly certain he has said as much to her in the past.", "created_utc": 1691006955, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15gjc8l/aita_for_telling_my_depressed_brother_he_only_has/", "score": 707, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Give me a break. The kind of person who does what he did is the kind of person who is morally bankrupt in general. It\u2019s not like, oh he had a bad day one time and didn\u2019t hold the door for someone at a store. He showed he is incapable of standing by his life commitments. But he didn\u2019t JUST betray his fianc\u00e9; he showed very clearly to everyone around him what kind of person he is.

IDK how you can be an asshole and petty about this if you're not Emma.\n\nWhy are you all so invested in his love life? Emma was not his perfect match. He did not like Emma. He likes Cindy and Cindy may be his perfect match. You've got to grow up and accept that.", "that's what he deserves. actions have consequences.", "So even if he was still single, the family wouldn't be interested in taking to him? So he is being disowned for cheating once. I don't think that's wrong, everyone has different levels of tolerance for cheating, but I think it's important to frame it as what it is. Never talking to your child or brother again when they cheated on their partner is going further than most would go, but I don't think it would make you an asshole. Personally I would consider if the crime deserves a lifetime of being cut off from your entire family. Maybe it is for you guys.", "Sounds like you and your family put a lot of pressure on your brother to marry this woman you all approve of and are punishing him not for cheating, but for not following the life plan you all had for him.

And while his family was harmed by his actions indirectly it just seems unhealthy in my head to put them in the same boat as Emma, particularly when renewing their relationships with the clear communication of how they were hurt by his actions as well may be part of what helps Matt be a better person. And seeing as western society has isolated people so deeply that family is the last refuge of support most people have maybe there is some obligation on their part to... if nothing else layout a sense of what they would need to move forward.\n\nI guess my point is more of, ostracizing someone is social death, it's one of the more extreme punishments we have short of physical violence and in my mind Emma is entitled to that, but Matt's family isn't as much.

Problem with that is, they are already no contact even before knowing he was with Cindy.\n\nOP also stated that the family would likely react this way towards Matt even if he wasn't with Cindy.\n\nThey are absolutely talking about forever and they already are taking actions in making that the case.\n\nMatt was wrong to do what he did. No argument there. But to toss away a loved child and sibling that had a good relationship with the family is a pretty intense reaction.", "Friendo\u2026 you do a disservice to all those who have been abused by using that word here. \n\nI\u2019ve been cheated on, I have not been abused. \n\nI have not been systematically physically/emotionally/financially harmed, on an ongoing basis, by someone whose direct intent was to cause that physical/emotional/financial harm as a means of control or out of some mental illness or unresolved trauma of their own. \n\nBeing cheated on is incredibly painful. And yes it can have lasting emotional effects and harm. \n\nBut I would *never* use the word abuser for a cheater. It minimizes and dilutes real abuse, and clouds that term. \n\nIt sounds like you may have some unresolved hurt related to this, and for that I\u2019m so sorry. But\u2026 words have power, and should be used with care.\n\nI\u2019m going to leave it here. I wish you a good evening.", "No, no they don\u2019t. Were you aware of everything that happened when it was just the two of them? What they fought about? What little things she did that drove him nuts and vice versa? Do you know if there were problems? \n\nI love both my siblings\u2019 spouses but their relationship and the inner workings of it are absolutely none of my business. My sister will confide in me about things, things that I know I would never put up with in a relationship (nothing awful, just difference in what we want in a relationship) and I say nothing because it\u2019s none of my business. She\u2019s happy. So is my brother with his wife. That\u2019s all I care about.", "It\u2019s hurt other people more than it hurt the person actually in the relationship? I get where Emma has been incredibly hurt, but she\u2019s really the only one who is valid for going nuclear over it. It boggles my mind how personally you\u2019re taking something that is not about you. You and your family are not the main characters in this saga. Be mad, sure. But\u2026 you perspective is wonky.", "You\u2019d being doing your brother a favor by never talking to him again. You and the rest of your family sound terrible.", "Sure. That doesn\u2019t mean that someone who cheats deserves being cut off from all of their immediate family permanently.", "i\u2019m so confused you\u2019re not the one dating these people. i\u2019ve had over 6 partners and my family has met every one of them. that\u2019s just life dude", "Y\u2019all are way to involved in each other\u2019s love lives\u2026 he\u2019s dating her, and has only been dating her for a short while. Meeting someone your brother is dating isn\u2019t YOU making some kind of lifelong vow to that person. It\u2019s literally meeting a girlfriend.", "I said nothing about forgiveness. I dnt believe in not telling someone why they are out of my life then walking away.", "Either cut them off or move on lol, you seem like the type to \u201eforgive\u201c someone and constantly remind them of their fuck ups lol", "They don\u2019t even talk to Emma anymore.", "Cheating is a vile thing to do to another person and I wouldn't want anything to do with someone like that...family or otherwise.", "Except the people you spend time with are a direct reflection of your morals and values. Just because they have the same blood does not mean they have to brush over their poor choices. He\u2019s pushing too much too quickly. He should be rebuilding his relationship with his family. Not pushing a relationship between them and his affair partner, that\u2019s too much to ask.", "I'll nip this in the bud right here. Of course I love my brother more than the woman he was supposed to marry. This was never a question. That being said, I find it completely unjustifiable that he would treat someone like this, let alone someone who loved him so much.", "When people grow up, they generally figure out that it is possible to love someone deeply and still be *really fucking angry* at them when they do something wrong.", "I\u2019m only allergic to one of them.", "If the son doesn\u2019t know why his family won\u2019t talk to him then his brain must\u2019ve gotten sanded down.", "How can he rebuild anything if none of them will speak to him?", "Yeah. Unless he betrayed another sibling or something, this is hard to swallow. Reddit (and apparently OP\u2019s family) is just so punitive about cheating, that it starts to approach unreasonable and doesn\u2019t make sense. I get why *Emma* would be upset that he\u2019s still with Cindy, but this isn\u2019t a movie. You\u2019re not all doing her a favor by continuing to ice them out. If your brother is going to be in a long term relationship with Cindy, slowly the ice is going to have to thaw. I\u2019m in the middle here: how he and Cindy got together shouldn\u2019t be irrelevant, but it also shouldn\u2019t doom them for life if they stay together and she becomes part of the family.", "Plus isn\u2019t it more of a reflection on how the parent raised the guy? \ud83d\udc40", "I agree. I know not every family is perfect, but as disappointed as I\u2019d be in my brother, I\u2019d still be there for him!", "This. It always shocks me how hard Reddit is on cheaters. Not saying cheating is okay, it NEVER is. But people aren\u2019t perfect and I could not imagine cutting off one of my siblings over them cheating. I\u2019d be mad and fully support them being dumped and it\u2019d take me a bit to wrap my head around it. But never talk to them again? Nope.", "You don't have to be perfect to not cheat on your partner.", "Yeah, it's bonkers.\n\nIf my wife cheats on me, then *our* relationship is done. I would like to hope that it would at least sour her relationship with the people who *should* have my best interests at heart too (my family and to a lesser extent, my friends who have known me longer than our relationship.)\n\nWhat I would not like to see is *her* family turn her back on her. She should still have her support system available to her. Her friends, family etc. I would hope they might care about me enough to condemn what she did, but I wouldn't want them the cut her out of their lives entirely out of some weird loyalty to me.", "sometimes I think there is a forum or something where people just try to post stuff that gets reddit riled up that is absolutely ridiculous, for the lols", "> But people aren\u2019t perfect and I could not imagine cutting off one of my siblings over them cheating\n\nPeople are different.  I can't imagine wanting to associate with someone who cheated.  I'd block them and pretend they don't exist and I don't care if it is a family member or a friend of 30 years. \n\nCheating is vile.", "No, of course not. Dude made an awful horrible choice and I can understand being mad at him. If one of my siblings did that I certainly would have words with them and I might avoid them for a bit. It\u2019d probably change the relationship because it would change how I saw them. BUT I wouldn\u2019t cut them off entirely, especially if they were hurting, even if it was their own fault.", "Exactly! And yeah, I\u2019d be extremely pissed if my sibling cheated on their spouse. There would be yelling and words. I wouldn\u2019t just let it go. I\u2019d want want some sort of explanation as to what they were thinking. But ultimately, that\u2019s my family, I\u2019m not going to stop loving them."]}
