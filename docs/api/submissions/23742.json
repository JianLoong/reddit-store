Our sister has also not spoken with him either.\r\n\nThis morning, I received a call from Matt saying that he wanted to reconcile with the family. He mentioned how upset and depressed he's been since making \"the worst mistake of his life\" and how much he regrets his actions. I was listening up until this point, but got annoyed when he started mentioning how also Cindy wants to meet our parents and the rest of us.\r\n\nHe told me that he left our parents a voicemail a few days ago, but they haven't responded, and that he feels isolated from our family. I point blank told him that he only had himself to blame for this and that he clearly didn't think what he did was a mistake since he was still with Cindy.\r\n\nHe said he just wanted us to give them a chance, but I told him I had to go to work and left the call while he was finishing a sentence as I was very frustrated with him.\r\n\nAITA?\r", "created_utc": 1691006955, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15gjc8l/aita_for_telling_my_depressed_brother_he_only_has/", "score": 28, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He did apologize and maybe is in love with Cindy. I don't condone cheating. You are blaming Cindy and your brother is to blame.He did come and admitted his mistakes. What does it slove if you want him to dumb Cindy? Not going to bring back Emma she probably has moved on.", "NTA\n\nBut you're all punishing him for something that happened 3 months ago and you're going to have to come up with a timeline to forgive or not forgive at all. It's obvious he cares for his current partner, and while he may regret cheating he does not regret the current partner. You can't control who he loves. If you guys can't get behind that you may loose him forever depending on how serious they are.

He may be clinging to Cindy because she is all he has left after everyone turned his back.\n\nDepends on \"What\" he regrets - cheating, lying to Emma, still seeing Cindy? \n\nSounds like every one needs more time to figure things out.", "Kinda hard for it to be the worst mistake of his life when he is currently dating part of the mistake. NTA", "Esh him for cheating and you and the rest of your toxic far more TA for cutting him off completely. Super toxic", "NTA.  Your brother should have not cheated on Emma.  Understandable that your family was fond of Emma and feeling hurt that Matt cheated on her with Cindy.  Matt made his big mistake and he brought himself to his depression.  He should have not cheated on Emma, plus hurting your family.  That's a lesson Matt needs to learn from all of this.", "INFO: Would the family's reaction be different if he was now dating a different woman and not Cindy?", "I guess you can\u2019t help how you feel, what your brother did was vile and selfish, tho I\u2019m kinda shocked none of his 4 immediate family love him enough to try to salvage the 31 year relationship ship with him. None of them enjoy his company and care about his well-being enough to keep contact. Your whole family\u2019s reaction is very offputting. The only way I can rationalize it is that you guys didn\u2019t have a particularly strong bond with him before and liked Emma and who he was when he was with Emma way more. \n\nI would get this reaction if this all happened a couple weeks ago but it\u2019s odd to write him off forever.", "YTA - it\u2019s terrible that your brother cheated on his fianc\u00e9e but he is your family. I don\u2019t believe that family always gets a free pass, but if he is otherwise a good person why would you all punish him endlessly for a mistake? Even if he doesn\u2019t pursue a relationship with Cindy are you all just going to treat him poorly because he isn\u2019t with Emma? What a terrible way to treat him. He may be better off without you all as his family if you can\u2019t get past a mistake he made towards Emma, not towards all of you.", "Massive YTA. You and your parents should go fly over to Afghanistan. For real, your purity tests would go over \"real\" well there. Also, if you aren't married or in a relationship...FYI this would be a massive red flag to most future partners outside of reddit. \n\nYour brother sucks big time for cheating. It was an incredibly shitty thing to do. But unless he's abandoning his kids and/or being abusive/racist, it's insane that your parents stopped talking to him for three months (much less that they are considering cutting him off for good). A parent's love for their child is supposed to be unconditional.", "NTA mostly because he can't say he made the worst mistake of his life and regrets it only to double down on the mistake. It's disingenuous, like buddy, you can't be serious. He's saying that to sound good but it's fake.", "I am glad you call him on this point: If cheating on Emma was the worst mistake of his life, why is still with Candy?\n\nI get it that Emma wants nothing to do with Matt.  Once a cheater .......\n\nI understand that the family is hurt, and angry that Matt cheated and really do not want to meet this woman.  \n\nNTA", "ESH - he shouldn\u2019t have cheated. However, your family is going nuclear. You and your family are now the ones making the decision to destroy a potential relationship with your brother going forward.

He did a bad thing, no question there. It\u2019s ok to let him know that you don\u2019t approve of his choices. But not speaking to him for three months is a bit much. His marital choices are his issue, not yours and not your parents. It\u2019s also possible for cheating to be a bad mistake but the person he cheated with to be a better match for him, but guess what you won\u2019t find that out unless you talk to him.", "NTA- You need to tell your brother reconciling with the family and the family means Cindy are two very different things, and not going to happen at the same time.", "how would they ever be able to recognize someone who was able to hurt someone so badly and betray someones trust in basically the worst way possible as family?", "I didn't mention wealth anywhere because its irrelevant.

What other closure do you need??", "But when they do and time has leap frogged and Matt says no and OP and family misses out on grandchildren, nephews and nieces.", "If stays with Cindy our parents have hinted that they'd be going permanent no contact and I think that our sister would follow suit. I don't think I could bring myself to speak with him either", "This would have been much better, but apparently he didn't respect her that much to even be bothered to consider it.", "If your mom or your dad cheat and got with their affair partner I guess you can start calling your new stepparent mommy or daddy.

And that guy lost his wife six months ago, and he should be over her by now!\"???\n\nGrief and forgiveness can't be put on a \"time line\".  OP states that the family loved Emily and now they have to mourn the demise of the relationship and what could have been. You are very cool and calculated to think they should be able to say, \"We will decide to forgive you in 4 months!\"\n\nYou are right when you say he can't help who he loves, but Matt never said that.  He is still with his AP, but that doesn't mean he loves her.  It just means she's all he has left right now.  \n\nAs far as having to decide to forgive or not to forgive, that isn't in Matt's hands and there is nothing he can do at the moment.  It's called \"consequence\" and he doesn't get to decide when it's over.", "the way to make him realize this is probably not to leave him totally isolated without her though, even if she is the worst mistake of his life he's depressed and completely isolated with her as a sole support now.", "Considering how much we liked Emma and the way he betrayed her. It would't have made slightest difference. This would always be the outcome. We (us and his friends) all thought that they were the perfect match.", "this comment perfectly summarises my thoughts on this", "Cheating is so wrong that the person who did it deserves the worst as the affair partner", "If he\u2019s otherwise a good person? Apart from the situation where he betrayed the person he promised to love and be loyal to for the rest of his life (which does not constitute one mistake but many; it\u2019s remarkably easy to NOT cheat given the multitude of individual choices that go into it) he\u2019s a great guy? Give me a break. The kind of person who does what he did is the kind of person who is morally bankrupt in general. It\u2019s not like, oh he had a bad day one time and didn\u2019t hold the door for someone at a store. He showed he is incapable of standing by his life commitments. But he didn\u2019t JUST betray his fianc\u00e9; he showed very clearly to everyone around him what kind of person he is. A cruel, entitled, disloyal, whiny little brat.", "His action was a direct reflection on his character and the standards that his parents raised him with. His family is setting a boundary. It sucks, but hopefully he chose right with Cindy, and they can pick up the pieces of their lives and move on.", "Obviously not. The bitter and anger that reaked from the OP does not show closure.", "Matt has a right to decide he doesn\u2019t want to reconcile anymore, of course. If that happens, OP will just have to respect it.", "Then those are the consequences of *their* decisions. That\u2019s how relationships work. \n\nIf OP comes back and complains in 5 years we tell him that\u2019s what happens and you made your choices. Maybe they are fine with those consequences.", "What if he hadn't cheated on Emma? What if he had simply ended the relationship and later moved on to Cindy? Would you and your family still disown him?", "So if he truly loves Cindy, you're family is going to choose his ex-fiancee over him? \n\nI'm glad I'm not part of a family that would do that. I hope Matt can find people that actually care about him in the absence of his parents and siblings that don't.\n\nCheating is 100% wrong but it doesn't deserve the death penalty.", "Well damn. Again, I can see where you're coming from, but I don't think I'd ever encourage someone to cut off a relative like that. Your brother is an asshole, but he's also unable to undo his mistakes.", "Yes, cheating is wrong. At the same time, is it a reason for parents to disown their child? I'd say no.\n\nEvery single one of you in this story sucks (except Emma), especially your parents. ESH", "What an awful family.", "Not going to bring back Emma. Is this the Mountain you and your family willing to die on? If they get married and have kids what happens then if your parents or you and your sister want to see the grandchildren and nephews or nieces? You haven't see him in a long time and he says no. Is this worth it disowning  him and his family?", "No one here is asking you to trust him. No reasonable person would at this point, at least for a long time, Cindy included. (She won't, either, that's the curse of being the \"other girl\" - you know another \"other girl\" could be right around the corner). You can actually have a relationship with someone you don't trust, just not a very deep one, that's fair.", "I'm sorry, does that mean you're hoping he cheats on her (Cindy)?\n\nYeah this is gross. \n\nYTA. IDK how you can be an asshole and petty about this if you're not Emma.\n\nWhy are you all so invested in his love life? Emma was not his perfect match. He did not like Emma. He likes Cindy and Cindy may be his perfect match. You've got to grow up and accept that.", "that's what he deserves. actions have consequences.", "So even if he was still single, the family wouldn't be interested in taking to him? So he is being disowned for cheating once. I don't think that's wrong, everyone has different levels of tolerance for cheating, but I think it's important to frame it as what it is. Never talking to your child or brother again when they cheated on their partner is going further than most would go, but I don't think it would make you an asshole. Personally I would consider if the crime deserves a lifetime of being cut off from your entire family. Maybe it is for you guys.", "Sounds like you and your family put a lot of pressure on your brother to marry this woman you all approve of and are punishing him not for cheating, but for not following the life plan you all had for him. Good chance he and Emma were not a good match, and he was miserable with her, only trying to make it work for as long as he could to make you all happy until he broke and, while going about it the complete wrong way, decided to place his own happiness first for once", "Sounds like you and your family put a lot of pressure on your brother to marry this woman you all approve of and are punishing him not for cheating, but for not following the life plan you all had for him.

There's nothing Matt can do at this point about his mistake. \n\nYou're in danger of becoming one of the assholes if you aren't already.", "Why? She is an affair partner what good she has?", "I don't know how you interpreted that.

It's not your RS, it's his. Your \"square one\" is a single brother and there's nothing wrong with that.", "So in other words, we continue to keep our distance from him", "OP's behavior is straight up Puritan New England meets the Taliban.
