But in the middle of the parking spot or access zone? Making things less accessible when it's literally a couple feet away from making things more accessible instead? Utter assholes.", "Wow!  And that's your parent!", "You said they're off the hook legally. They absolutely are not.", "HER car door HER responsibility so take your no no no\u2019s somewhere else", "Basic accountability. I guarantee if you look up passenger door dings car next to mine the owner and driver of said car is accountable. IDK which country you are from but it\u2019s a thing in America", "If you think snitching on your friends, betraying their trust is more important than a paint job, you\u2019re just another human.", "I had an older woman do the same to me. I asked her to please not hit my car with her doors (my car was weeks old at the time) and she started yelling at me in the parking lot.", "Can't you use your uninsured motorist coverage to pay for the damage?", "Most places go to I\u2019ve found in the last couple years is to just replace the bumper, it\u2019s easier then fixing it.", "Which is going to have its own costs even pro se.   Sounds like a crappy situation and OP admits fear drove her\u2026she knows legally, she is actually liable.  She should have left her own info and then gone after coworker.  Handing out someone else\u2019s number isn\u2019t okay.  YTA", "If I\u2019m understanding your question correctly (can the damaged car\u2019s owner or their insurance company sue OPs passenger for civil damages) the answer yes. In this scenario it wouldn\u2019t be worth it economically, but technically they would be in the right to do so", "No, that wouldn't happen.  They would just pay it.", "I have never understood this. My dad parks his car further away for the same reason, and there is always someone who will park next to him, or on both sides of the car. Even though every other space is available :D", "I drive a shitty car and dont care if I get dinged. I will.purposely park super close to people drivers side door when they park over the line in hopes they have to crawl in the passenger side. I like to think I am an agent of karma in those moments lmaoo", "Same. I love those spots bc no one can park beside you.\n\nEdit a word", "So, when my grandmother parked in the handicapped spots, she used to leave the carts in between spots by the signs because she said it was easier for her and other older people to access them. She would always get excited when one was left for her.", "\\*nods\\* the ironic part too is she had the placard too.... shes being lazy about getting a new one, \"dmv wants a new paper from her dr\" so she always wants to use mine. I refuse. \"I'm a cancer patient\" if im  having a bad pain day i'll use it but  most times i dont like using it and it makes her mad when i wont.", "In that sentence I was talking specifically between them and the driver, not overall. Before that I even said op would have to take it up with the coworker to try to be reimbursed. Sorry you were confused by how I worded it!", "They didn't say they're off the hook legally.\n\nBut you did. Did you make a typo and accidentally omit the word \"not\" and now you're not noticing it?", "It's insurance ArmChair, not responsibility. I'm afraid their no's were warranted.", "Dude I working in auto insurance claims for YEARS. You don't know what you're talking about.", "No it's not. This is no different than someone ramming a shopping cart into a car.", "Deductible might still be more than the $250 they paid the friend.", "I doubt it? Insurance is required to drive where I live", "Hitting someone\u2019s door and freaking leaving isn\u2019t okay. The selfish coworker could have ruined the other car owners Christmas! For all anyone knows the other car owner could barely be getting by, saved just enough for Christmas, but now has to fix their door because some tw4t wasn\u2019t responsible enough to not jam their door into another car and now they have to pay for someone else\u2019s mistake.", "Thank you!! I appreciate you responding!", "Good to know, thank you! Learn new things every day and today I learned something from you :) I appreciate that!", "Because some people are jerks. They think they are making a point by parking next to you when you've chosen to stay out of the main area. They think you're protecting your car and not everyone else's. I had a former friend who usef to park as close as possible to people who parked far away purposefully. They are self absorbed, so they assume everyone else is.", "When my mother in law was still alive, my husband would take us to the store, and we would use those van parking spots because they were pretty close to the store.", "I wasn't confused. It's what you said. It's fine, though, glad you clarified.", "I don\u2019t really care . A lawyer would tell her to keep her mouth shut and tell the guy or woman to prove it . They don\u2019t have OPs name so they can\u2019t call her as a witness", "No it\u2019s not. Because the person who ran their cart into your car is the one at fault and that\u2019s where accountability and liability insurance comes into play because if you can prove the offender ran said cart into your car they are the ones at fault.", "My state requires drivers to carry uninsured motorist coverage on their policies, even if you only have liability. It protects you in the event of an accident with another party that is uninsured. Hit and runs are usually covered through uninsured motorist.", "I didn\u2019t say leave.  I said leave her info bc it\u2019s her insurance that\u2019s responsible", "I don\u2019t think that they would\u2019ve bothered to fix a scratch on their door if they were hurting that bad. \n\nIMO, it\u2019s a grey area. I actually kind of agree with Away_Simple, and leaving the coworkers info was kind of not ok. It sucks, because it\u2019s not OP\u2019s fault, but if she wanted to leave a note, she should\u2019ve put her own contact info.", "This is what I think too, it just seems so ridiculous and childish to go out of the way to park next to someone for these kind of reasons. But people be people \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb", "Yeah I\u2019m in a province, if you don\u2019t have insurance you don\u2019t get to drive, valid proof of insurance is required to renew your plates(vehicle permit I think in the states), you need to carry it while driving, I\u2019ve gotten a ticket before because I forgot to swap my insurance card one year and got a ticket for it. The officer could look up and see I had valid insurance but since the card itself was expired I was issued a ticket, driving without insurance gets you increasingly larger fines/vehicle seizure. As such if uninsured coverage is available it\u2019s rare.", "I don\u2019t care about that. You said giving the coworkers information out wasn\u2019t okay, yes it was. It 1000% was. The coworker walking away is what WASN\u2019T okay.", "If it\u2019s deep enough to see metal, it can lead to rust, so yes it needs to be fixed.\n\nOP is not the asshole. Coworker is. I don\u2019t give a dang what the coworkers excuse is for not leaving their own information because the OP would have been in worse trouble if it was caught in camera. OP did the right thing by leaving the coworkers information.", "IMO, ESH. OP should\u2019ve left their insurance info, then given her insurance the coworkers information."]}
