I moved in due to some serious mental health issues that caused me to have to leave my career. My parents were happy to have me, and have consistently said that I need to focus on my health, and that it's okay I don't currently have a job. \n\nPart of the mental health issues I'm struggling with is severe insomnia. I'm not currently able to keep a consistent sleep schedule. I have prescribed medication (to take on an as needed basis) to help me sleep, but taking it makes me groggy for the next 36 hours so I prefer to save it for when I need it.\n\nSince there are days where I am sleeping from 6am to 3pm or similar, I end up eating meals at odd times. I have always been Very careful to not wake anyone up - I check with the fam every few days to ask if they heard anything or if they slept uneasily, and its never been an issue. We have a large house so I can afford to do things like grill a cheese without disturbing people. My mom takes issue with this, but not for any concrete reason - just that its \"unhealthy to eat so late\". \n\nYesterday I got up in the evening, and found out my sister had baked a cake - and my family had eaten all of it. I was a little hurt they hadn't left me a slice, and my mom taunted me saying if I'd just been up at dinner time I could have had some. \n\nWell the craving didn't leave, and I got a brilliant idea to just make my own little cake. It was about 3am when I started, and I ended up with a decent cake. I ate a bit, and put the rest away. \n\nThe Next day my mom is Furious. She starts yelling at me the minute I come downstairs, saying it was too late to be cooking, that I should have eaten with the family, that I was just showing my sister up, etc. I defended myself saying I just wanted cake and didnt see what the big deal was. She's now saying I'm setting an awful example for my siblings and that I don't appreciate everything the family has done for me. \n\nAm I missing something here? AITA?\n\nEDIT: Hi I've seen some confusion so I wanted to add - I do have diagnosed insomnia. I don't sleep 3am-6pm everyday. My sleep cycle changes every few days. Some days I'm up at \"normal hours\". Some days I'm fully nocturnal. I am working with multiple therapists and doctors.

Also, if you sleep from 6 am to 3pm you don't have insomnia, you sleep 9 hours so, even more than most people actually so I'd say your hours are shifted. Maybe you don't sleep this much every day but I just wanted to point out.", "I'm confused. How is making a cake showing your sister up? And how are you setting a bad example? If the kids need to know why you made a cake in the middle of the night, all she has to do is tell them that you have trouble sleeping at night. How is them not leaving any cake for you so you make your own a sign that you don't appreciate everything they have done for you? I think NTA but this whole thing is just confusing to me. I could understand if you were waking everyone up by doing this, or leaving all the washing up for someone else. But if you're not, then what's the issue?", "NTA. The cake doesn't know what time it's being baked. I'm sure it tasted just as good. \n\nSeriously, your mother is trying to control you and force you into a \"normal\" day/night schedule. If it's not working for you, or not working for you yet, that's okay. It's not something for them to go ballistic over. In fact it's kind of an odd thing for her to freak out about. I don't understand what \"awful example\" you could possibly be setting. That you can bake and eat when you want to without conforming to her rules? \n\nAs long as you were quiet, didn't wake anyone up, and cleaned up after yourself, there is absolutely no problem. It might be something you'll need a therapist as mediator to get across to your mother though. Good luck.", "[deleted]", "INFO: Why would you get yelled at for baking a cake? Your mom's reason for yelling isnt clear. What does baking a cake at 3AM has anything to do with you being ungrateful?\n\nEdited after OP's response:\n\nNTA\nYour parents attempt to force you onto the schedule that they think is 'right' doesn't go with the spirit of letting you recover and letting you take care of your health. You need to make your parents understand about what you are going through. They need to be onboard with your requirements,  not that there are many. If thats not possible, staying with them may be worse for your mental health", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Did you think they'd give you a medal? It's unfortunate they did not leave you a piece of cake but it doesn't justify causing a racket in the kitchen at 4 am when your family is sleeping.", "NTA. This isn't really about the cake,  but more about how your mother is bothered by your schedule.  It sounds like your mother is saying that she is supportive of your healing but is not truly on board with it.  You are behaving to different.", "YTA. You are not reading the room.  Your parents are trying to tell you to have a sleep pattern the same as the rest of the house.  Your parents took you in and are paying to feed and house you.  You should be considerate and try to have the same sleep hours as them.  Baking a cake at 3am bring in noises and smells that can wake the household.  Time to think outside yourself and make concessions to meld with the family routine or find your own place.", "NTA Your mom is being controlling. As long as you are not disturbing others, you can cook and eat any time you want. Unfortunately, however, that behavior probably will not stop so you are sort of trapped there unless you can find a way to get your health under control enough to become financially independent. \n\nYou might try sitting down with her and saying you really hate the insomnia. You are trying to get better and her guilt tripping does not help.\n\nFor what it's worth, I'm pretty sure professional bakers often do their cooking at like 4am. That doesn't matter but it struck me as ironic relative to this criticism.\n\nEdit: as a fellow insomnia sufferer, I have to add: sometimes the most productive time is at bizzare hours. You should take steps to get it under control, which you are, but on certain nights, it's just a losing battle against your own brain. If your brain is running in high gear, sometimes it's good to point that in a productive direction.", "NTA, and I would look into moving out. Taunting you like that was nasty, and your egg donor should be ashamed of herself. They're not helping your mental health at all, and it sounds like they may not actually believe you.\n\nIs there a friend or someone else you can stay with, maybe a WFH job? You may also qualify for short term disability. Good luck.", "NTA your mom is just a control freak", "NTA\nYou know how they say this is not about the Iranian yogurt? I think this is not about the cake.", "NTA. I thought this was going to be about how you made a ruckus at 4 am backing a cake, but it was just your mom being mad that you made a cake and didnt eat with them at dinner.. You have a mdeical condition that impacts your daily schedule. You can't help that.", "Cake aside, if you're not working a night shift or something, sleeping all day when everyone else is awake and then staying up all night while everyone else is asleep is generally a pretty rude way to treat your family. You deliberately avoid having meals with them, and then wonder why they just eat without you?", "Insomnia makes it hard to fall asleep, hard to stay asleep, OR cause you to wake up too early; it doesn't have to be all 3. That means even if someone sleeps solidly, if they take ages to get to sleep, they may have insomnia.", "Hi, I just wanted to clear up that I do have insomnia - I don't regularly sleep from 6-3, that was just an example of a possible sleep schedule. Insomnia keeps me from sleeping at a normal, regular bedtime, and so my sleep cycle shifts often. I'm just lucky that I don't have to wake up at a set time these days or I would get much less sleep.", "Well I used the same recipe as my sister, so I think that's where she got that. And my being up at 4am is a bad example.", "\u201cThe cake doesn\u2019t know what time it\u2019s being baked\u201d had me laughing so hard!!

Insomnia can take different forms and can have different causes (mental or physical). Basically it means that you have a structural sleeping problem. For example some have difficulty falling asleep causing them to stay awake for hours, others may experience interrupted nights or wake up at odd hours. It doesn\u2019t mean that you do not sleep ar all\u2026 As a person that has been struggling with insomnia for years, the analyses of \u201cyou just find it more pleasant to stay awake at night\u201d is a bit frustrating.\n\nThat being said. OP: I feel you with the weird nights. Keep up the good work with the doctors. And also hope the cake was jummy. NTA.", "Thank you, I currently see a few therapists for my health. Unfortunately in my case it is just severe insomnia. If I could hold a normal sleep schedule I would, but I can only manage it for about a week before getting off track.", "Here is some unsolicited advice.  Take it or leave it.\n\nAre you OP\u2019s doctor?  Are you *any* kind of doctor?  If not, kindly s t f u.", "She seems to think that since I'm staying with them, I should be eating all my meals with them and \"participate in the family\".", "I didn't think they'd care. Everyone apart from my mom was fine with it. My brother was happy there was more cake. Also to be clear, no one heard me baking or cleaning up (at least not that they told me).", "Insomnia is a disorder, not just the person opting to stay up. OP is literally unable to manage their sleep routine due to insomnia, it's not them being selfish. OP is mindful of the noise they make and regularly asks the family if they're disturbed, and has said nobody mentioned being disturbed by the baking, so I don't see an issue here.", "I do not deliberately avoid them. I eat with them whenever I'm awake during their mealtimes. I have medically diagnosed insomnia which makes it extremely difficult to maintain a sleep schedule.", "I understand. Insomnia is terrible, like a kind of torture, I've had it in the past and it sucks. I hope you can get better soon!", "I still don't think that makes any sense. How fragile is your sister to jump to a conclusion that you did it to show her up? \n\nAnd I get that being up at 4am would be a bad example 'normally' but this is easily resolved by explaining to the kids that this isn't a usual situation and that you have trouble sleeping. She's making it weird when she has all the power to explain it all and not make it weird. Or even make it into a funny story. You'd be a cake-eating vampire in my story.", "I know it's hard. I deal with it too. I hope you can get a handle on it... My life (I'm 63f) would have been totally different (better) if I'd been able to get my sleep issues under control when I was your age.", "As someone with a family member who has similar behaviour but not due to a disorder, it's just what they want to do, I see what your mum means. It's a bit rude and doesn't feel like family. However, you have been diagnosed with insomnia, aren't able to somehow \"fix\" yourself, and join in when you're able to. NTA. It seems your mum isn't fully supportive, or maybe doesn't believe you?", "Don't believe that the OP actually has it", "My sister doesn't care, to be clear. Just my mom lol.", "Thank you very much, I hope so too"]}
