This is the beginning of you, as a young adult, learning to set and maintain appropriate and reasonable boundaries. Take heart, though, I do think over time your father will come around and the two of you will be able to resume a more healthy relationship. Good luck, stay safe out there and enjoy your motorcycle!", "NTA. I'm also from south Asia. My dad asked me to do the same thing when I first got the job. I refused outright. He was unhappy. But in time got used to it. The Sooner you cut of the chord the better it will be for you.", "NTA your father is financially abusive and controlling beyond any level of reason.  Honestly why do you want him to talk to you?  Is it because you feel like you Need him in your life?  If so why?  You've been plenty successful without him, what has he done to prove you need him.  Please don't say \"fed and clothed\" or any variation on the bare legal minimum to prevent having a child taken away.\n\nFamily is an honorary title, it sits upon the pillars of Love, Care, and Respect.  Anyone tearing those down has willingly surrendered that title and should be held to the same metrics you would a stranger.  If you wouldn't tolerate someone being this toxic in your life who you just met why would you tolerate it from someone who should be treating you Better then others.", "She's saying things like \"What your dad is saying is only for your good\" and stuff.

Thankfully I didn't have a controlling mother and was given full financial control for my money.\n\nAsk your father if he has a detailed plan of when he's allowing you to buy the things you want to buy and you'll see his only plan of action will be to keep it in that savings account. Old Indian mentality makes you just save all the money and sacrifice basic human necessities for the \"greater future\". And \"little kids\" don't know how to save money\n\nOne mediation logic I can suggest is to tell him how you plan on making both short term savings (e.g. your bike) and long term savings (e.g. emergency funds etc), if you have any basic investment plans, how you want to plan tax exemptions etc. And if he is open to hearing them, then I think this conversation can move forward. Else it would be a good idea to have that in your own account and make sure he'll not have access to it. Have seen a good amount of controlling parents who just happen to get access to their kids bank account here.\n\nNTA here.", "NTA.  You are an adult, you can save your own money.  But please do take at least 10% of each paycheck and put it in a savings account that you absolutely do not touch.\n\nAs for how you get your dad to talk to you about normal things?  I don't think you can.  Your father wants to control you and you aren't allowing that.  If he acknowledges you are an adult and treats you as such, he is consciencely admitting he can't control you.  Give him some time to adjust his own thinking.  Do not talk money with him at all.  If he brings up your salary, your spending, your savings, etc, just say \"I'm not discussing that with you, let's talk about something else.\" and change the subject.", "Grow up and handle your own money.

You can now save or spend it as you please (responsibly of course).\n\nControlling parents don't do it out of love. They do it out of fear and mistrust. Your father doesn't trust you to make good decisions and at 23, with a great job, you are old enough.\n\nIf he sulks, that's his loss", "Going to be less extreme here because I think a lot of comments don\u2019t really understand the cultural nuances and the potential loss of cutting out a \u201ccontrolling\u201d family member. \n\nI also have a very controlling father that likes to be involved in my financial decisions and monitor my finances.\n\nMaybe suggest that you will keep your own money now, but he can have the passwords to your accounts to see what you\u2019re spending and saving. My father is the same in that he would *never* touch my money, but he still thinks he needs to guide and advise until I have my own family.", "NTA\n\nYou are a full grown adult who lives on her own and pays her own bills. You don\u2019t need daddy\u2019s permission to spend your money, nor do you need to send him ANY part of your salary.

Stand up and take control of your life already!", "No, you are not the arsehole. What you are, is a young adult whose parent is still seeing them as the little kid they once were and is not handling the fact that that is no longer the case very well.\n\nI think your dad is feeling very upset by a number of things. You're gone, out of the house. That's big. You're in another city. That's big. He's the father of an adult now, so he's no longer young. That can be a big whack to someone's self-image.  Heck, you're very obviously an adult, which means you're not his little boy anymore. That's a big adjustment. All this is all mixed up with whatever else is going on with him and I imagine he himself doesn't really understand why he's upset.\n\nTake care. I hope that you and your dad work through your differences.", "NTA give him some time OP. He\u2019s shocked that he\u2019s lost control and he\u2019s sulking as a result. \n\nYou set a healthy boundary. Chances are his father wasn\u2019t dictating his finances at 23.", "NTA. He\u2019s trying to control you. Sounds like a win that he won\u2019t interfere anymore.", "I am Indian, and your father prolly gaslighting you to make you believe you are the wrong one.

Your dad has been emotionally abusing you forever, you you finally stood up to him and declared your under.  Good for you!!!!  Now your dad is punishing you.  Oh well, let him.  You feelings are a normal part of being an abuse survivor, you are living in a way that is normal for others, but unfamiliar to you and against your dad\u2019s wishes.  And your dad has raised you to believe that you need him to make decisions for you.  Of course this new chapter in your life feels scary- free and exciting, but scary and guilty too.  Move, take the job, you\u2019ll be fine.  And please wear a helmet on your motorcycle!", "Sending your dad money like that is... Pathetic tbh.\n\nNTA but please go see a therapist.", "Are you Indian?", "Don't share salary information with him. Don't let him know how you spend your money. Put him on an information diet.", "You have moved before and thrived. You can do it again. Your salary is none of your father's business. It's not a point of discussion with him anymore. He does not need to know about what you spend on. It's time for you to keep thriving on your own terms. Just make sure you are not spending everything you make, have some savings on your own. You can do it", "I am from India. Don't feel lost. Just sign up for financial education classes and set a budget for spending on things you like. Give your Dad time to cool.", "Was just going to type this.

Mine stopped speaking to me about 6 years ago following the first time I ever told him \"no\". \nYou might not hear from him again and that can be difficult.

But don't let the fear stop you from doing the things you want to do. You're an adult. It's time to make your own mistakes and learn the lessons you need to learn about being out in the world. You can do it.", "I tell my three children all in the 20\u2019s, god gives everyone of us one token of life. I taught them it\u2019s their token after 18 years old and they should never let anyone use their token, even their mom. I share with them my experiences positive or negative. I definitely have discussions if I see the choices they are about to make could cause negative outcome but they\u2019ll also learn from mistakes. Mistakes are valuable lessons and can lead to personal growth. It happened to me as well, and I am still learning and growing. I wouldn\u2019t think about taking their life learning lessons. I cut my parents out of my life as well, best decision I made.", "True. That does not, however stop 55% of 1.3B population from already owning one.
