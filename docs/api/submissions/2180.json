He never used to let me go out, and have fun with friends etc and I became very anti-social because of that. When I was 20 and in my last year of college, my dad didn't let me go on my official college trip, which literally everyone else went to. (My friends  even arranged money and asked me to come for free with them). But money wasn't the issue. I was very upset and emotionally down because everyone looked at me with sympathy because the final year trip is like a huge thing here. (I'm in India). Just like that, I wasn't allowed to go on another highschool trip either lol. Still, all of that is fine because it's my parents' money and I was living under their roof after all. \n\nAfter I graduated, I started getting a salary of 20k INR every month, and then I moved to another city to look for a better job while learning more skills. My dad asked me to send 5k every month to his account so he'll save the money for me because I will spend it lavishly. I complied, and started sending him 5k every month. (  he's not selfish or anything, he doesn't want that money for himself, he wants to control what I do with it). \n\nNow last month, I got a way better new job than that and I'm making like 55k INR a month. Now, he's asking me to pay a lot of that to his account as my \"savings\". I said I won't because I want to buy a motorcycle for myself, it was always my dream and now I have the means to actually do that. The problem with sending him money is that I'll need HIS approval to use my own money. He said no, he won't let me buy a motorcycle now but he'll tell me when he thinks the time is right. I told him I'm 23 and i don't want to wait till I'm old to buy things I want. We argued and out of anger he sent everything I saved which was with him to my bank account. He's not talking to me now and he said he won't ever interfere in any of my business ever. Am I the asshole? How do I get him to talk to me about normal things and make him let me do whatever i want with my own money?", "created_utc": 1668314518, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ytrzp9/aita_for_telling_my_dad_ill_do_whatever_i_like/", "score": 83, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I\u2019m not from India but the idea that your father requests you send money so he can control it is very strange to me. You are a GROWN adult. Keep YOUR money in your account where only you can access it. Save and buy a motorcycle.   Ride it and enjoy! This is your life to live. No one else\u2019s. I\u2019d go low contact with your dad or give him basic information, I\u2019m good. Job is good. Weather is sunny. Etc. Don\u2019t ask for his permission or opinion on your spending habits. He will learn you don\u2019t need his guidance or blessing to spend YOUR money. Good luck and enjoy this life!", "NTA. Open your own savings account and stop sending money to your dad. Buy the motorcycle if you want. You are an adult", "I\u2019m not from a culture where parents have control over an adult \u2018child\u2019s\u2019 income. From where I sit, he was very controlling and unpleasant when you were younger. He wanted to continue that control. You can earn money any way you like. And then, you get to keep the money and make choices about where to spend it. You might make mistakes, but we all do sometimes. You\u2019ll manage. It\u2019s called adulting. You\u2019ll be good at it.", "Make sure you save while enjoying your freedom. \n\nWhen someone else has been controlling your savings you didn\u2019t have to think about it.  After it is all in your control, you may want to spend it all. \n\nDo go forward. Enjoy your bike. But remember to save too! You can do it!", "NTA!! Dude I'm Indian and I can totally relate. My dad is the same way, very controlling and strict. I have always wanted a scooty or a bike but he says no. I am just biding my time for when I will be financially independent. It's your money and you are not obligated to have your dad control it or you. You may feel guilty at first thinking that you are obligated to listen to your parents and please them. Not true. Live your life man.", "NTA.\nI'm not familiar with Indian culture and family concessions.  In my option, you finished education, live outside the family household AND earn money by yourself.

You're now free, live life to the full", "NTA ok you got your money. He'll be back, no worries.", "NTA. Cut contact. Don't give hom anymore money. Red flag", "NTA I realize culturally India is much different than the US.  My Friend from India has told me quite a bit about life in India. She was lucky her family allowed her freedom but when she married his did not!  You are an adult. You have done great with your life so far, but it\u2019s time to determine your own path.  Take the job, but don\u2019t go wild with your monetary freedom or you\u2019ll he\u2019ll never let you forget it. Don\u2019t let him control your choices.  Advice is fine, control is not.  Enjoy your new city and job. Yes, he\u2019s an elder but times have changed in some parts of India. Don\u2019t be guilted into second guessing your choices.\nGood luck!", "NTA. 100% I'm also Indian and no exactly what you are going through. You have guts standing up to your dad like that. There is nothing to be afraid of, since you now have the financial freed and can take care of yourself. No parents should treat their child like that. Trust me! Best of luck for your future, everything will be alright.", "I hope i can do that. Now after all this argument I feel lost and am really scared to move to another city for the new job and it's making me really insecure about everything lol", "He always had control over everything. Now he's guilt tripping me making me think that I'm selfish for all this.", "I doubt he'll be back tho. He's the most stubborn person I've ever met in my life.", "That's exactly how he wants you to feel. He's been working to make you feel that way for 23 years. It's time to cut the cord. Take a few deep breaths and start packing your things, and go live your life! You're an intelligent and capable adult, you don't need someone else to give you permission to act like any other adult. NTA.", "I understand. I was young and working a new job in a brand new city with zero family near me at 23 too. But listen, you are smart and you can do this. You got your degree. Move to that city. Get that first apartment. Take the new job. Dive into work. Get to know your colleagues. Mine helped me so much. Everyone was so helpful in giving me recommendations for local doctors, dentists, hairdressers, etc. In fact my colleagues were more helpful than my parents because they knew the city I was in. And it was such an exciting adventurous time. I know it\u2019s new and scary but you\u2019ll find your routine and get comfortable in your career. You\u2019ve got this!", "NTA dude. I am an Indian too. What your dad is doing is not normal at all. His behavior is very much controlling, he has made sure that you remained anti social so that you face difficulties becoming independent. Do not enable him. Move to the city, get your job, spend time with your colleagues and take care of yourself. Keep your dad on information diet, don't tell him more than bare minimum.", "Dear Dad I wish you would have more faith in your parenting abilities. You have no need to worry about me as you have done well in raising me.  Yes I would like to buy my dream motorcycle, but once I have I would like to resume sending the original 5k to you for future savings. Please believe in yourself Dad you have done an awesome job.", "\"How do I get him to ... make him let me do whatever i want with my own money?\"\n\nYou don't get him to do that. You just ignore his unwanted advice about how to spend your money. You can choose to ask/tell him to stop giving you that advice or to stop criticizing your choices. Alternatively, you can just say, \"Ok, got it.\" and then do whatever you want.\n\nUnless Indian law provides for some legal attachment between parents and their twenty-something offspring, you literally just don't do what he tells you to do. I realize that this can be hard for anyone from any culture, and probably moreso in your culture than mine. He may also have some good financial advice, but ultimately what you decide to do is your decision, not your dad's decision.", "Nta.  You have won!   Hopefully he leaves you alone forever. Because he will never treat you with respect and as your own person.  Block his number and enjoy your life", "Indian here. This is not a cultural thing. It\u2019s a control thing.", "I knew he wouldn't do that. He loves me, but wants me to live on his rules. \n\nHe literally said \"I'll be your financial advisor until I marry you off to a girl. Then you both can do whatever you want\". Indian parents smh", "Also if this is an anxiety - find yourself a CA or a financial advisor if you can afford this - even maybe having one advisory session with someone can help you plan how to manage your finances if you're worried about this!", "Coming from a similar background, I have stopped taking about my career with my family. Job change, hike, promotion, my salary, they don't really need to know.", "As a motorcycle rider, get that bike and let it all go on the road. It is the best feeling. Just be safe and responsible driving. You have dreams and goals. Dont let anybody hold you back", "He's guilt tripping because he's losing control and trying to get it back.", "NTA - Indian living in India here, NO THANKS to all of this - my parents have insisted I set up some savings accounts and FDs etc, but they've NEVER taken my money into their own accounts. You can pretty easily just open a second bank account or make a recurring deposit on your current bank account so that you have money being saved every month. Also, controlling your finances till you get married? What if that doesn't happen as soon as they expect, or at all? Please don't feel guilty about any of this. Keep your savings, use them wisely, get that motorbike!", "He doesn't love you in a way that is respectful to you.", "Until he marries you off? Bruh"]}
