He never used to let me go out, and have fun with friends etc and I became very anti-social because of that. When I was 20 and in my last year of college, my dad didn't let me go on my official college trip, which literally everyone else went to. (My friends  even arranged money and asked me to come for free with them). But money wasn't the issue. I was very upset and emotionally down because everyone looked at me with sympathy because the final year trip is like a huge thing here. (I'm in India). Just like that, I wasn't allowed to go on another highschool trip either lol. Still, all of that is fine because it's my parents' money and I was living under their roof after all. \n\nAfter I graduated, I started getting a salary of 20k INR every month, and then I moved to another city to look for a better job while learning more skills. My dad asked me to send 5k every month to his account so he'll save the money for me because I will spend it lavishly. I complied, and started sending him 5k every month. (  he's not selfish or anything, he doesn't want that money for himself, he wants to control what I do with it). \n\nNow last month, I got a way better new job than that and I'm making like 55k INR a month. Now, he's asking me to pay a lot of that to his account as my \"savings\". I said I won't because I want to buy a motorcycle for myself, it was always my dream and now I have the means to actually do that. The problem with sending him money is that I'll need HIS approval to use my own money. He said no, he won't let me buy a motorcycle now but he'll tell me when he thinks the time is right. I told him I'm 23 and i don't want to wait till I'm old to buy things I want. We argued and out of anger he sent everything I saved which was with him to my bank account. He's not talking to me now and he said he won't ever interfere in any of my business ever. Am I the asshole? How do I get him to talk to me about normal things and make him let me do whatever i want with my own money?", "created_utc": 1668314518, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ytrzp9/aita_for_telling_my_dad_ill_do_whatever_i_like/", "score": 202, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Red flag", "NTA I realize culturally India is much different than the US.  My Friend from India has told me quite a bit about life in India. She was lucky her family allowed her freedom but when she married his did not!  You are an adult. You have done great with your life so far, but it\u2019s time to determine your own path.  Take the job, but don\u2019t go wild with your monetary freedom or you\u2019ll he\u2019ll never let you forget it. Don\u2019t let him control your choices.  Advice is fine, control is not.

Everyone was so helpful in giving me recommendations for local doctors, dentists, hairdressers, etc. In fact my colleagues were more helpful than my parents because they knew the city I was in. And it was such an exciting adventurous time. I know it\u2019s new and scary but you\u2019ll find your routine and get comfortable in your career. You\u2019ve got this!", "NTA dude. I am an Indian too. What your dad is doing is not normal at all. His behavior is very much controlling, he has made sure that you remained anti social so that you face difficulties becoming independent. Do not enable him.

Please believe in yourself Dad you have done an awesome job.", "\"How do I get him to ... make him let me do whatever i want with my own money?\"\n\nYou don't get him to do that. You just ignore his unwanted advice about how to spend your money. You can choose to ask/tell him to stop giving you that advice or to stop criticizing your choices. Alternatively, you can just say, \"Ok, got it.\" and then do whatever you want.\n\nUnless Indian law provides for some legal attachment between parents and their twenty-something offspring, you literally just don't do what he tells you to do. I realize that this can be hard for anyone from any culture, and probably moreso in your culture than mine. He may also have some good financial advice, but ultimately what you decide to do is your decision, not your dad's decision.", "Nta.  You have won!   Hopefully he leaves you alone forever.

It\u2019s a control thing.", "I knew he wouldn't do that. He loves me, but wants me to live on his rules. \n\nHe literally said \"I'll be your financial advisor until I marry you off to a girl. Then you both can do whatever you want\".

You can pretty easily just open a second bank account or make a recurring deposit on your current bank account so that you have money being saved every month. Also, controlling your finances till you get married? What if that doesn't happen as soon as they expect, or at all? Please don't feel guilty about any of this.

Bruh", "NTA the way to make your father respect your independence is to stop compromising with him on it. Stay in contact. Be polite and friendly. But buy what you want to buy and if he complains say kindly \"Thank you for your opinion.\" And then do it anyway. Talk with him over the phone or out of anyone's home; make sure you always have the option to leave the conversation on your own terms. If he demands to know why you hung up/left, explain politely that you are an adult who doesn't need to be scolded like a child. Keep being friendly and open with him but ending the particular instance of contact when he tries to bully you. It makes it harder for him to cut you out, especially if you hear his advice out, decide for yourself if its good and take the stuff that is. If he truly won't answer you then end your conversations with your mom with \"And tell Dad I love him\" but DO NOT beg for him to talk to you. \n\nHe is using his silence to punish you because its all he can do now you no longer depend on his home and money. That means when his silence fails to bring you in line, he will have to abandon it.", "I am from India. I can understand your situation and the feeling of guilt. I had a father who was abusive and for some reason, my family thought it was okay to let an 11 yo kid who lost his mom to be around a drunk and manipulative maniac. There were times when I had to literally grovel and beg for basic things from him and was guilt tripped into giving up a lot of teenage experiences and his control extended all the way till I was 23. I had a breaking point one day when I decided that I am not going to live under this abusive household and packed and moved out to a relative's and from there to another part of the country altogether. I was scared, uncertain and drowning in brown boy guilt (abandoning a parent being a sin and all) but I overcame it, made a lot of progress and a lot of mistakes, and now living my own life with LC/NC with my dad. \n\nWhat I am saying is, you're NTA and you will learn to navigate life one way or the other which also involves managing your own money. Don't worry, move cities, get the job.", "Nta. You are grown and that is your money. \n\nYour dad is acting like a child and throwing a tantrum that he didn't get his way. \n\nIt's about control and manipulation.", "NTA. Good. Never send him money or ask him for permission again.", "NTA honestly you're old enough and the money is yours and not your father's roc control", "NTA. Some luxuries are best enjoyed at the right age. Soon you may lose the excitement and it will simply be a necessity. Some chances once gone are gone forever and parents don't understand that. I'm an Indian and totally get your context.. him being controlling doesn't mean he doesn't love;  you wanting to enjoy some of your hard earned money without his consent, doesn't mean you don't love him. \n\nOnce married, you will have a lot more responsibilities and you will always have to think twice before buying anything. I'm sure you'll also hear a lot of \"you don't respect your parents since you've started earning\" blah blah blah..just ignore all that..\n\nIt's not right that he has made you think you cannot survive without his guidance.. that is untrue and you need to work on your self confidence. \n\nAlso, never ever forget to be responsible with your money. Savings are important. Investments are important. Since I am able to guess you still want a peaceful relationship with him... just keep insisting that you want to buy it and give him sometime to process all this..  he'll see that it is not your intention to rebel or disrespect him... Give him sometime and if he still doesn't come around.. then you'll know you tried! \n\nJust remember to NEVER compromise on your happiness just because your parents 'think' they know better!", "Hii OP. I'm Indian and I do understand your problem. I know you are sad right now with the fight from your pops. But he will come around. He will understand that he can't control you all the time. People like us has to fight for everything we need. Jab tak kalesh nhi hoga kuch nhi milega. So hold your ground. He'll be okay in a few days and aise hi dhire dhire he'll understand that you are your person and he can't control you much. It might take some time but it will happen. \n\nI'll just add that even if he is angry and not talking to you, you should call home frequently.

You are already doing all the important big scary things, you are living alone, managing your money, working a job, supporting yourself. You are doing great!
