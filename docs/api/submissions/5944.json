You probably have (and sadly will have) better boundary violations to discuss with them and handling this issue should definitely be put on hold right now while you focus on you.

You are growing, and right now isn't the time for this, they could have waited.  Sounds like they don't care about your feelings if you have voiced that you're not ready to speak on this.", "NTA your father just passed and they aren't letting you grief on your own terms.  They are furfilling their own emotions not yours thereby being incredibly selfish.", "Yta - it's a book for your kid, not for you. Be an adult and put it in a box in the basement not to be touched til your kid turns 18.", "NTA. You are grieving. In-laws are insensitive AF. I\u2019m sorry for your loss.", "Right?! Like if they absolutely *had* to do it now, couldn\u2019t they do their side first and just hold on to it until OP isn\u2019t dealing with fresh grief and is in a better place mentally to work on it? \n\nLike sure now she should absolutely not be involved in that for her mental health and grief but in a year or two I\u2019m sure she\u2019d love to do that. Or would\u2019ve loved to do it if the in laws hadn\u2019t jumped the gun while she was in the midst of grief.", "Oh man, I think you completely misunderstood the issue..\nIt's not that my side of the book is empty.. that was my decision. I'm fine with that. \n\nIt's the disregard to my simple request to give me privacy and time by making this book in the first place... for a boy who, as you said,  CAN'T READ.\nThey went directly against my one wish in a time of grief.  That hurt...", "It may just be a book for my kid. Although a case can be made that it's for the inlaws..\nBut it's my house. And I decide what goes on in my house and what my 5 month old can have.\n\nThey can resend it at a more appropriate time in the future...", "Personally I'd say don't even send it back to them.  Throw it away.  If they ask about it just tell them that you couldn't stand that level of disrespect, so you disposed of it.", "My guess is that they wanted to do something special for baby's first Christmas. \n\nHowever, given the circumstance, they should have put that idea to the side ... maybe save it for their first baby.\n\nThey are admittedly very insensitive. A shame they didn't listen to their son.", "If you send it back it\u2019ll be brought back out and out and out for years and it will *always* bring with it sadness and anger. Just trash it and then you don\u2019t have to deal with it again.", "Yeah but it still makes you an AH imo...my point isn't that it's \"just a book\" it's that it's a book for your kid and not you. It's not about you. It's not for you. A book about family history is a family heirloom in the making, and if my mother prevented me from getting that, I would be mad at her. Btw, don't argue against your verdict, it's against to sub rules. I'm sure you're gonna get ruled the way you want given how much reddit hates in laws and loves to see people \"stick it\" to their in laws.", "I second this. Just throw it away so it\u2019s never re-sent to you. NTA and I\u2019m sorry for your loss OP"]}
