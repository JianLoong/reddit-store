Send it back and include a kindly written note that you asked them not to do this.  Include where they have overstepped and remind them that you are now a family.  You, your spouse, and all your children, current and future.   This should always be your 1st priority and responsibility.   As such, you kindly ask them to respect this new family by respecting you, your needs and the things you say.  Pour lots of sugar on it in the tone so they can\u2019t call you names    Keep a copy fir you r records.  It might be good to state that you know they \u201cmeant well\u201d.

You do not accept the book.\n\nFrankly, you do not appreciate them refusing to drop the whole issue to give you space after the first incident. There was no urgency to this project and the timing was extremely insensitive.

They should have accepted that you are grieving and not made it anyway.

I hope you can get some therapy around this soon - you deserve an uninvolved party to vent and process all this.", "NTA.\n\nYou don't have to accept the \"gift\" if you don't want to.  That's your right.  They can hold onto it until your kid is an adult and present it to the kid then.", "Absolutely NTA tell your husband to deal with it, not just let it go.

So take what I say with a grain of salt.  \n\n\n You don't have to be the bigger person, but you can store away the book for now. I don't know if they think they are trying to make amends or another way to be nosey. (But) When your baby is older, or curious about your side, you can build on that part of the tree together. It could be a bonding activity and a tender way to show your father in a light that doesn't surround his gruesome death.", "Soft NTA. I understand the pain and grief you are going through.

Now if they wanted to just make a genealogy type book of Daddy\u2019s side that would be one thing (still think it\u2019s not a great time). But to have a family tree style book with your whole side blank is beyond fucked. There are plenty of websites where they could have made personalized books that included your child and even them in the story. They had plenty of options and made a horrible choice.", "I think it depends on if this was a fill in the blank type book or a book with printed pictures. With a printed book, I would think it would typically be the parents that would make something like this so that everyone is included. I feel like they could have found one that was more of a Daddy\u2019s side genealogical type book instead of getting one that leaves all of mom\u2019s side blank. While she could double stick tape pictures in and write on pages, it will look kinda tacky in comparison. It\u2019s a nice thought but definitely not the time. I\u2019m sure mom would have been willing to be involved later down the line.", "It really sucks. Look after yourself.", "Yeah that behavior, while unkind, is pretty common for in-laws and you have a right to set boundaries. That preexisting stuff combined with your grief is a pretty triggering cocktail. I don\u2019t know if sending it back will accomplish what you want though, or if this is the hill you want to die on? You probably have (and sadly will have) better boundary violations to discuss with them and handling this issue should definitely be put on hold right now while you focus on you. Maybe have your partner keep it at work or in the garage until you\u2019re feeling a little more balanced? And make sure he takes on a more active fending off role for now - you deserve to not have to deal with this. \n\nI\u2019m sorry, that\u2019s a lot to handle and you\u2019re also still very post-partum. Were you doing ok before this? We don\u2019t give new mothers nearly enough support, and your OB or midwife might be able to help you with resources to help manage all that you have on your plate. Sending big hugs your way.", "They asked, you said no, they decided that didn't matter and went ahead. That's malicious. Even without your grief, if someone makes an offer and you decline that should be the end of it.", "What do they think the purpose of a *Family Tree* is anyway? \n\nIt is a project that could have waited until you were emotionally capable of providing your family information and photos. Their urgency is not transferrable to you. I'm with you - send it back.", "It\u2019s just the one side of the family tree. My in-laws don\u2019t know anything about my side of the family so I personally would think it\u2019s weird if they created it with my side but didn\u2019t have all the correct info.", "Why keep interacting with them then? Treat it like junk mail.", "Thank you for your input.\nI'm sure there will be more boundary overstepping in our future. I can handle it most days.\nBut this time I couldn't.. So I don't see any scenario in which we keep the book.\n\nThank you for asking about me, I'm doing fine otherwise.", "Which is why I think it would be better for the in laws to wait to make the book until OP felt stronger about going through family photos. Bc they originally wanted to include her family, but chose not to wait for her to mourn. Which is selfish. Especially bc the child is 5 months old.", "Because if you don't make the effort to actively establish boundaries against people like that, they will continue to stomp all over them. They need push back before they will ever stop.", "Agree to disagree.", " NTA. A lot of people (myself included) find creating a family tree book or photobook for THEMSELVES very cathartic after the initial period of loss has abated. \n\nYour in-laws made so many mistakes here: sharing details of your father\u2019s passing, pushing you for family info when you\u2019re still the initial stage of grief, not accepting your clearly stated boundary and making and sending a 1/2 completed book. You have an infant. There\u2019s SO much time in the future to do this and the last thing you should have to worry about. I\u2019m so sorry for your loss, OP.", "Esh. Slow down.!!!!!!!!!

Or, you could use their info, combine with your family background, and make a combined one that has your little one at the end. I personally would love to have a family tree from both sides.\n\nETA: NTA, but the in laws behaviour is uncouth.", "NTA. Your in laws are insensitive and overstepping a boundary. You asked them to step back and they aren't respecting your wishes.\nIf this was happening in a couple of years I would be more lenient, but so close to your father's passing it feels like they're doing it just to rub your loss in your face with the pretext that \"it's just a gift\".", "Why do I feel like your in-laws were using this 'family tree' thing as a way to fish for identifying information about your dad and/or family so they could look up more salacious details?", "NTA.

Do you have a fireplace, send them a video of the book going up in flames.", "Keep the book for the child and later do a book with your side in it..

Not just bad timing but true cruelty. I\u2019m so sorry you are dealing with this. NTA", ">objectively there\u2019s nothing hostile apparent in them making a family book right now. \n\nI disagree. Their son (her husband) told them *more than once* that this was *not* a good time but they argued against that and did it anyway. That is a 'hostile' move, in my books. \n\nBlatant disregard for a perfectly valid request at an incredibly difficult time just *screams* boundary-obliterators. As pointed out, there was *zero* need to shove this family tree down OP's throat when both she and their son made it clear this was a terrible time. It absolutely could've waited for another time.", "Return to sender refused the moment that mail person tries to deliver it.", "If I had to guess, they are reflecting on their own mortality. It\u2019s still incredibly selfish, but I imagine they are afraid of their grandchild not \u201cknowing\u201d them or information being lost when they inevitably pass."]}
