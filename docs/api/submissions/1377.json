The guest instructions were arrival from 1:30pm for a 2pm start. We were 5mins drive up the road at around 1:40pm and waiting for my friend's GF (who we only met a couple of months ago) to come out to the car to leave.\n\nI am driving and my GF in the front passenger seat. She likes to arrive to things very punctually and gets stressed over being late (so normally would have arrived at 1:30pm exactly); I'm a little more relaxed over these things. As a result she is getting worried in the car and wants to hurry up friend's GF so reaches over to press the horn. I think this would be very rude so grab her wrist to stop her as I think we still have enough time to be there and seated on time. She thinks it is rude to be late so wants to get moving. At the time she glares at me but doesn't say a lot because my friend is in the car.\n\nThis was on Saturday; I've been away for 5 days for work (Mon-Fri), but since coming home she has raised the issue again (Friday evening) and has said my behaviour was unacceptable. The fact she has raised it six days later shows she feels strongly about this. I tried to say that two wrongs don't make a right, but she should not have been honking the horn. She has said grabbing her wrist is coercive behaviour and I should not try and justify what I did. This seems extreme to me and is expecting me to make a full apology, while I tried to agree that it wasn't the best moment for either of us.\n\nI can see how what I did isn't perfect, but we weren't late to the wedding and were seated in time (not that ends justify the means!), however in my opinion she was about to be rude unnecessarily to my friend and his GF.

She was being rude and invaded your space first (with irritation too, so naturally you got defensive). Not to excuse getting physical, but she was physical first when she reached over.", "YTA.\n\nI\u2019m with your GF about being late. It is rude to peoples time. YOUR friends gf was super disrespectful. And you choose to be disrespectful to your GF.\n\nYou were in a parked car. Your GF was trying to show a case of urgency. How you feel is not the only thing that matters? I understand the anxiety your GF felt because I live with that anxiety when I\u2019m late. You cared more about your friends gfs feelings rather than the mental health (yes anxiety and being anxious from being late is part of mental health).\n\nGet your priorities straight.", "NTA.  You are the driver, you get to decide if the horn gets blown or not.", "It seems inappropriate that a passenger would think that sounding the horn is permissible.  Grabbing a person's wrist to prevent operating any of the controls related to driving the vehicle while undesirable seems permissible as a last resort.

I hope they\u2019re happy when someone in front of you gets out of their car to bash the shit out of you or worse because of their behaviour.\n\nUgh.

Why does she have to reach over and create a disturbance for everybody?", "My family always insisted that boys beeping in the driveway instead of coming to the door was low class.\n\nMake of it what you will.", "NTA. She was about to be rude to someone you barely knew. You stopped her. She doesn't have a right to invade your space and honk the horn of your car. Her focus on you physically stopping her is deflection from the point. If she was that stressed, she could have gone to the door to check on the woman.", "NTA she isn't the one driving she could have easily caused an accident by reaching over like she did", "NTA\nI would get pretty angry if someone reached over to the steering wheel while I was driving.", "**NTA**\n\nNormally I'd say Y-T-A for physically stopping your partner from doing pretty much anything that isn't dangerous, because WOW that's not at all okay under most circumstances. \n\nBut when you are behind the wheel of a car, even if it is parked, it absolutely IS dangerous (and this is one of the first things that driving instructors teach you) for anyone else to be reaching over and touching the steering wheel, the horn, or any of the other driver's side controls. Cars are nothing more than societally acceptable killing machines at the end of the day. They need to be treated that way. She could have startled you or another driver on the road. She could have accidentally bumped another control or the steering wheel. \n\nYour GF needs to learn to keep her hands to herself and on her side of the car when someone else is driving. Period. You are NTA.", "ESH, Everybody Sucks Here.\n\nNo problem you preventing her from blowing the horn. Blaring the horn for someone in the house is obnoxious---and your friend in the back should have gone to the door to get his girlfriend anyway. You're not teenagers.\n\nBut you kicked off this scenario by already being late to the wedding, just because \"you're a little more relaxed about these things.\"", "YTA. You characterize this as just stopping her from doing something, completely minimizing the fact that you grabbed her by the wrist. \n\nYOU GRABBED HER BY THE WRIST. \n\nGrabbing is a fucking no no, okay? She has every right to still be upset about it 6 days later. It\u2019s a HUGE fucking red flag to many women that you might escalate later and maybe grab her arm, or maybe push her a little, or block her exit. So you need to bend over backwards to apologize and assure her you will never EVER lay a fucking finger on her to try to control her EVER AGAIN.", "They were parked at a house waiting for his friend to come out.  \n\nESH.  Friend sucks for not being ready on time, OP sucks for grabbing at his GF and downplaying her concerns about being on time, GF sucks for not just going up to the house and for not talking about what was bothering her for 6 days.  Also I agree that only the driver gets to decide to honk the horn, so GF sucks for that too.", "Except they weren't driving. They were parked...", "Bit dramatic! No one should be touching the wheel of a car when someone else is driving parked or not. What else are you supposed to do with someone's hand to stop them? He absolutely had every right to stop her hand from going anywhere near the wheel of that car. First of its rude and allowing her to do it would mean she thinks it's okay and could potentially do it while he was driving."]}
