{"id": 6467, "submission_id": "1032ji6", "title": "AITA for extending a vacation when my husband can't?", "selftext": "My husband and I are going on a short trip to Rome for my birthday in a few weeks' time. We are both looking forward to it, and he's never been to Italy, so he is especially so. While chatting with my family on New Year's Eve, I found out that my brother and his wife have an upcoming trip planned to Italy as well, coincidentally arriving the day after my husband and I are due to fly out. A shame, because it's been ages since weve seen them in person, as we live in different countries. I am close to my brother, so when he asked if we would be willing to extend our trip and come join them in Florence, AND told me that he'd cover our hotel as a birthday gift to me, I was excited to discuss it with my husband.\n\nUnfortunately, he can't take any additional time off of work. I have the time myself, as I am currently unemployed (so the initial trip would be entirely on him). I wouldn't want to be an additional financial burden by asking him to pay for an extension he can't even enjoy himself, but I have a little money of my own saved up, so I said I would handle the flight change fees, train to Florence, and additional expenses myself. His reaction when I told him that was more sullen than anything, but he had no objections to me extending the trip otherwise. Or so I thought, because he went off on a mini rant about increasing costs of living, and expenses, and how he has to work to support the both of us, but how can I say no when I don't have to spend any more money on that, etc. I was taken aback, because we are obviously keeping an eye on our expenses, given we are a one-income household right now, but I had expected a better reaction than that from him, maybe more along the lines of \"I wish I could go to Florence with you, but since I can't, I hope you have a blast there with your family.\" I told him as much, and he went off in a huff, but he came back and apologized later.\n\nYesterday, I made the arrangements with the airline for a flight change, and did some research on the side on what to do/see in Florence. I've been there a few times before, but I love exploring new places, so I enjoyed doing that. I didn't tell any of that to my husband, as I suspected he was still a bit sore/jealous about my trip.\n\nSure enough, this morning he was grumpy and distant towards me, and when I called him out on it, he said he's still trying to work through his feelings about the Florence thing. I said we still have a Rome vacation coming up with just the two of us and that we are going to have a lovely time there, and he said he knows that but that his enthusiasm has dampened since the Florence thing came up. I understand where these feelings are coming from, but secretly, I think he's being a bit of a baby about it, and his grumpiness towards me is dampening MY enthusiasm for the trip. AITA?\n\n---\n\nETA: Based on the comments and requests for info below, I guess I need to add a few things. My current state of unemployment is because I had to leave my job four months ago due to post-covid complications. Recovery has been tough, but things have improved enough that my husband and I decided on taking this birthday trip to celebrate. As far as finances are concerned, our agreement always was to create separate budgets for our nest egg, our household, and to have separate personal savings. He, for example, just bought himself a new PS4 game with his, so we are not in the red. We have not significantly tapped into our emergency funds, and we have no rent or mortgage to pay.\n\nAlso relevant - I was in his position of being sole breadwinner in the past, because I supported the both of us when he took time off from hia career to work towards his Masters. So I can fully empathize with the stress of that, and I don't intend on unnecessarily prolonging my unemployment.\n\nAnd while not regularly 'employed' now, as I understand the definition, I still am in touch with my old company, which values my previous work with them enough to have given me a freelance project that I am currently working on. I have only received partial payment for that as of now, but most of that went into our household fund. I did offer to cover some expenses for our trip using the rest of it, but my husband waved away that suggestion, as I have 'gifted' him with trips too in the past, and it's just something we like to do for each other.\n\nAll that being said, I recognize I have been insensitive to his feelings in expecting him to be 100% okay with Florence, at least not immediately. I'm happy to say we've talked it out since I posted this and aired everything out on both sides. Feathers have been unruffled now, and we are back to being excited to plan for our time together in Rome.", "created_utc": 1672835467, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1032ji6/aita_for_extending_a_vacation_when_my_husband_cant/", "score": 458, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you had money of your own saved up that you can afford to spend, then it should have been put towards your and your husband's trip rather than expecting him to cover the whole thing. Though since you're unemployed, you probably *can't* afford to spend it. You're increasing the burden on your husband by spending what little funds you have on a longer vacation just for you.\n\nI suppose you realize that this resentment will be hanging over your head the entire time you are in Rome with your husband, right? You have ruined your vacation with him in exchange for one with your brother. Sounds like a shitty trade to me.", "YTA. You\u2019re unemployed yet using your savings to extend your vacation while your husband has to support you both. It sounds like he is becoming resentful about your employment situation.", "YTA, your \u201csaved money\u201d is not for vacations when you are not employed and your husband provides all income. \n\nThis was completely selfish and entitled. It also seems you think very little of your husband.", "Yta\nIf you have money saved that you can use on a trip, why did you make your husband pay for the entire trip to Rome instead of helping him when he already has to support you both?", "Soft YTA. I get that you're excited about going to Florence and seeing your brother, but think about it from his perspective. He's the one working to support you. It probably took time to save up for this trip. Now you get to stay on vacation while he has to go back to work to pay the bills that allow you the freedom to spend more time on vacation. He snapped, but he apologized the next day. It happens. You now know that he's sore about it.\n\n Instead of dropping it, you proceed to tell him about all of the fun things that you want to do while you're there. Things that he can't do, because he has to go back to work to pay the bills. Do you really expect him to be excited for you? Maybe you expect him to make suggestions about the things you should do without him? Don't keep bringing it up, you're rubbing salt in the wound.", "Yeah, gonna say YTA.\n\nIf you have some \"extra money\" saved up but are unemployed, you don't need to be blowing it on the extended trip if HE is being the sole income earner supporting you both.\n\nYou need to go home and focus on getting a job. It's irresponsible and rude to basically use it as \"fun money\" when you're otherwise not contributing to the household expenses.", "YTA. It\u2019s the complete invalidation of his feelings that did it for me. Despite \u201ckeeping an eye on expenses\u201d he\u2019s telling you that the money is a stressor. Have you ever been the sole income of a home during a financial crisis? It\u2019s brutal. It\u2019s emotionally draining to shoulder that pressure and then to have your partner gloss over that while also spending more funds is easily a straw that breaks the camels back. He\u2019s taking on all the financial responsibilities to support your home while you get to spend on a trip just for you. \n\nI\u2019ve been in your shoes as the unemployed partner and there is no way in hell I\u2019d treat my husband this way especially during a time he\u2019s stressed trying to support us both. He\u2019s making sacrifices to do that yes? So should you. I understand wanting to see your brother and it would suck to miss the extended trip but if you go, you should fully understand your husband is justifiably hurt and that sort of thing has the tendency to linger.", "Soft YTA. This is a trip you were supposed to do together. As equals with a shared experience. It's about solidarity as a couple on a *couple's* trip. But now, he has to fly back alone and go to work and you get to go have more fun with your brother while he has to miss out. You are unemployed and taking advantage of the fact that you have infinite free time, while your husband uses vacation time and he earned the money to pay for it. It's the principle that is upsetting him.\n\nEither do it together as partners or not at all. Accept that there are time limitations on your trip because of a job that keeps you both afloat.", "INFO:  how long have you been unemployed, and how much of a financial burden has that put on him?  \n\n\nI see that the Rome trip was a birthday gift to you , so that doesn\u2019t \u201ccount\u201d against you that he paid for it.  But has he been shouldering the full financial burden (rent/mortgage, bills) for a while now?  That makes a big difference in whether this was an AH move or not, honestly.", "Soft YTA since you are dipping into savings and are unemployed to pay for part of the trip.  Plus, your husband going home alone is going to be a sore point for him.  I say soft because you do have a great reason for wanting to see your brother in all this.", "YTA\n\nI think this stems from something more than just the trip. I do understanding wanting to see people when you can - that does not mean it would not hurt your husband to not be involved.", "You have money in savings, that doesn\u2019t mean you can afford the trip. How long can the 2 of you live on one salary? Do you have more savings if there is an unexpected expense, emergency?\n\nYou mention you discussed it with your husband.

How are you making up for the fact he has to pay for everything, what other chores and responsibilities are you taking on?  When only one spouse is working and paying for things it is reasonable the other one will start to resent them.

You could\u2019ve checked in with him and asked how he felt about it before you just told him you were doing it.

Who is paying for that? \n\nYou are already a financial burden, end of story. That savings should be saved for an emergency, or if you don't think those happen, then you should have offered that up for the trip. \n\nYour husband is seeing this: He supports you currently (and even if prior to you being unemployed you were equal partners and if you have supported him in the past, this is the current situation), he is fully paying for a trip to Italy. You didn't offer up a dime of money for that trip. But now, because you are unemployed, you get to go on an additional holiday and SO graciously offered to use your own money for that, while your husband has to go back to work to SUPPORT YOU.", "Soft YTA. I was leaning toward N A H but you seem to want him to be happy for you. It\u2019s not going to happen. He\u2019s the sole income earner, having saved a lot for your birthday trip, who now has to fly home alone to work to support you both while you go to Florence with your brother. His feelings about this are just as valid and understandable as you wanting to spend time with your brother. You need to acknowledge how your actions have hurt him even with your excitement to go. If that dampens your trip, at least you both get to be a little disappointed.", "Info can he cancel the first week trip? That would eliminate all the concerns about money", "INFO; how many days are you extending the trip by?", "NTA.\n\nHonestly, I 100% get where your husband is coming from and I personally wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable in either position, however, you\u2018re allowed to enjoy an additional trip with your family even when your husband can\u2018t join you.\n\nHe\u2018s entitled to his feelings, but he has no right to take it out on you like that and try to prevent you from something you\u2018d like to experience and afford yourself.", "NTA.\n\nThe reaction you had hoped for (\"I wish I could go to Florence with you, but since I can't, I hope you have a blast there with your family.\" ) would have been that of a supportive partner.\n\nEdit:  \n\nSome comments on this post are deeply troubling:\n\nI just don't see the harm in her having this extended holiday in Florence with her family. Couples don't need to be joined at the hip and do everything together. If my partner had this opportunity I would be delighted for her, while being a bit sad I couldn't participate.\n\n  \nThe unemployment situation is a separate issue. It doesn't make her his indentured servant. They are equals, regardless of the current financial arrangements. To imply otherwise is horribly misogynistic.", "NTA Enjoy the trip. Also be understanding that your husband is disappointed and jealous that he can\u2019t come so I suggest respecting his feelings. I think it\u2019s a bit harsh to say he\u2019s being a baby about it.", "NAH- you're not ta for going and neither is he for how he feels. Although I do wonder if it's too late for him to change his vacation time to be during the time of the trip to Florence instead.", "Going against the grain to say NAH.\n\nI understand why your husband might be upset. I also think it probably has something to do with dipping into your savings for a luxury while he is covering the cost of everything in your day to day.\n\nI would go to Florence too though. I'm very close to my siblings. If we lived in different countries and an opportunity presented itself for us to spend time together, for the cost of a train ride/flight rebooking, I'd take it. It would be much more expensive to book another flight altogether to go visit brother another time. Especially since brother offered to cover costs once you're in Florence.\n\nDefinitely something you and your husband need to work through before you go though.

Don't have fun until you're old is a weird societal thing we've got going on.\n\nI went on vacation with a friend while I was unemployed, set up two job interviews via email while I was gone, got a job shortly after returning, and my husband didn't begrudge me any of it. It was a similar situation, I didn't have to pay for a place to stay, just went in in a car rental in Ireland. When I work full time I don't have time for vacation, I see nothing wrong with using the time you've got to enjoy yourself. It's not like she's been living off him for years.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

I said they could hold some sort of job. Many jobs don\u2019t involve even a tiny fraction of the physical abilities involved in traveling alone.", "NTA. You're already in Europe, it would be weird not to see your family. You have a legitimate reason that you're unemployed and you're working on returning to work. Marriage involves give and take and just bc it's your turn to 'take' does not make you an AH.", "NTA it's an amazing opportunity, that is not going to be burdensome for you. You also get to see family. Enjoy your trip.", "NAH. You're getting a great opportunity and it's not surprising he's bummed about missing out.", "NTA", "NTA. He should be happy for you. Very childish on his part", "NTA. He can have fomo, sure, but your bro is chipping in, it\u2019s family, and it\u2019s your bday. He should be happy for you, especially since y\u2019all have each supported each other and gifted each other trips.", "YTA\n\nYou, currently unemployed, are using your savings to give yourself extra holiday time - a holiday your husband has already paid most of - rather than to contribute to the household? You really think he should be picking up your every daily expense while you waste your money on a holiday? That really isnt fair on him at all", "\"Bought himself a new PS4 game\"....so, $12? Lmao. Soft YTA.", "> Do you really expect him to be excited for you?\n\nYeah, this is so weird to me:\n\n> His reaction when I told him that was more sullen than anything, but he had no objections to me extending the trip otherwise.\n\nLike, \"when he took a bite of food, he projectile vomited everywhere... but I think he liked my chili!\"", "Don't forger she said him being a _bit of a baby_ by being upset about it. I don't think she appreciates her husband that much.", "So you are admitting that the finances of the relationship are somewhat a point of contention and your SO specifically pointed out being uneasy about them?\n\nAlso you say you \u201cdidn\u2019t have to dip into the nest egg much.\u201d I\u2019m sorry if you are dipping into your nest egg but also talking about extending the vacation with your personal money there is an in-congruency here. \n\nIf the finances were totally fine and the issue was him having enough time it would be a different story. But because seemingly the financial aspect of this whole thing has been stressful to your SO I have to say YTA.\n\nJust imo dipping into the nest egg period, being unemployed/not earning enough to contribute normally (regardless of the situation), extending the trip are at odds with each other they shouldn\u2019t happen simultaneously. \n\nI\u2019ll leave this question if he had the time to take off work, do you think he would extend his vacation too or would he go back to work anyway out of anxiety for the finances? If he would go back to work either way then I feel like deep down you know the answer here", "OMG, I read that as he bought a PS4 console. The cost of a PS4 game wouldn't cover dinner for 2 at Applebee's but she's going on vacation to Florence. Totally equitable. Totally.", "Yeah but she could have easily waited a few months, wait for her husband to re-build his PTO or be able to take time off work again and go to a trip together to go visit her brother to the different country he lives", "YTA get a job"]}
