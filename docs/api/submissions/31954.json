She strictly breastfeeds, so as you can imagine, she gets far less sleep than I do. During the day I help with changing or holding her but all feedings are up to Jen (the baby outright refuses a bottle- we have tried several times, but ultimately we are both okay with this).\n\nAnyways, I'm kind of a independent start up video game developer. I did make one video game 2 years ago but it honestly wasn't that great. So while I do get revenue from it, it's definitely not much or even a liveable wage. This time around however I'm working with 4 other people and the game is turning out great. I also work a 9-5. But after getting home, having dinner with my fianc\u00e9 and looking after the baby for awhile, I jump on and work on the game.\n\nFor the past 2-3 nights I have been up til 1-2am working on the game and I have been ultra tired. I snore like a maniac when I'm tired. It's super embarrassing because I truly sound like a mack truck. But yesterday the baby had her 2 months shots and she was so fussy. Cried way more than normal. It was super hard for my fianc\u00e9 to get her to sleep. I finally went to bed around 2am and my fianc\u00e9 immediately asked me to sleep on the couch so I wouldn't wake the baby with my snoring. I said no. I was so tired and the couch is not comfortable at all. I had to work early. I wanted to sleep. She didn't fight it but she called me a \"fucking prick\" and walked out of the room with the baby. I woke up this morning to the baby in the crib in the nursery and my fianc\u00e9 asleep on the floor with no pillows/blankets.

Used the money to get himself a halloween costume. Took me home from the hospital, left me there alone and took my car and disappeared for hours. Used my money for the costume and when he finally arrived, my money was gone and he had to get ready for a halloween party that he just couldn\u2019t miss. Next day we had an awful fight. I got so stressed and depressed that i stopped eating for a whole week and stopped talking completely. I was basically in shock. Whenever i felt hungry i ate a chocolate to not faint due to low blood sugar. I could not breastfeed my son because i did not have any milk at all, no matter how hard i tried. I was lucky if I could get out 1 oz at a time, from both breasts. After 2 months trying, I stopped and had to give him formula. So OP YTA, because now you are not only causing stress to your partner but potentially causing your baby to not have food if she gets stressed enough. What are you planning to do if this happens and the baby does not take a bottle? Do you know she will end up in the hospital if she does not has a way to get food?

It is a huge responsibility especially when she is exhausted which I'll bet beats your \"ultra tired\" by a mile.

She probably would love time for a long bath, or maybe a foot rub or something. The woman seems like she's 24/7 on call with your daughter so she needs to grab sleep where she can because babies tend to wake up crying many times a night for many reasons, they are hungry, or have a wet or dirty diaper, they are lonely, feel sick or have gas pains, they are too hot or too cold, there's too much light, too much noise, or they just wake up and can't settle back to sleep alone. It's really really tough to know you may have to get up every hour or two and possibly even more frequently than that. She needs sleep. She needs to sleep in the bed. If she says you are snoring too loudly, as you yourself say  \"like a mack truck\", and will wake the baby and prevent her from sleeping then you need to move to the couch.

They should be doing shifts. If he wants to stay up late then she should go to bed early and he should be in the nursery or living room with the baby until 1 or 2 am. No headphones, no sound on his video game. Baby wakes up he needs to hit pause or save and parent. \n\nDuring his half of the night shift he should be bringing her the baby when it fusses for food, changing the diaper, burping the baby, comforting the baby, cleaning up any messes/changing pjs and sheets, and putting the baby back down (rock or shush to sleep etc) so all she had to do during that time is dream feed and she could get more rest. He should be bringing her water cup refills or snacks as she needs them during his shift.

They would definitely benefit from putting a full or twin bed in the nursery so they could both have good sleep and both be doing half the night parenting care.", "Any story that starts with \"I was so tired after something unnecessary I chose to do, and I want to be *comfortable*\" and ends with \"my partner slept in a heap on the floor because they're overwhelmingly exhausted from the demands of childcare\" is probably going to end with YTA without even having to ask", "I feel like this dude is about to bail or she is.

My sibling called me sobbing that they couldn\u2019t cope anymore. Me, being the closest thing my youngest sibling had to a mother as I had changed THEIR diapers and fixed their bottles, I was their first call. I drove over, took one of their shirts from the laundry, made them go to bed, said take your damn meds and this mug of water, and then said don\u2019t you dare come out of that room for at least two hours. \n\nI put on the shirt so I would smell like mom, put on the same deodorant my sibling used and I wore that baby in a wrap for absolutely hours. Baby wasn\u2019t perfectly happy (definitely still suspicious and giving me side eye \ud83d\ude12 that I wasn\u2019t mom \ud83d\ude02) I did dishes, laundry, tidied up, general housework while wearing and bouncing baby so my sibling would have none of it to do when they got up. \n\nAnd baby wasn\u2019t thrilled that they could just not get my shirt open for a boob but I warmed up the bottle, popped it in their mouth,  and baby had their hand stuck inside my shirt just grabbing and smelling their mom while I was giving the bottle. It worked well enough that baby took the bottle without spitting it out. Afterwards baby fussed because no boob for comfort but we went for a walk outside with me holding a pacifier on top of the shirt until baby settled back down and finally slept in the wrap. It was awkward af but I was determined to not wake my sibling up. \n\nNo one talks about how much moms need a whole support system to help them not break during those early months. No one tells you how much breastfeeding will drain you. No one tells you just how BAD the sleep deprivation will get. I will admit I was exhausted just after helping for one afternoon! And I have been a night nanny and daycare provider so it\u2019s not like I don\u2019t know how much work it takes. After that my siblings and I made a plan and started showing up a few days a week so our youngest sibling could just get two or three hours of solid sleep each of those days.", "If I knew where she was, I would offer to help her pack up her and the baby's things and leave his ass.

I\u2019m not a mom but all this bs with how men treat pregnant women makes me want to rise up. I don\u2019t plan on having kids and seeing how men are, in general, with their pregnant wife or child and wife, makes me not want them even more. It actually sickens me with the lack of empathy.

Their partner also was doing those shifts. \n\nSo they had at the time between the two of them: three preteens/teens, a preschooler, and toddler. I and our next oldest sibling offered to rotate weekends of childcare. (The second time we did this for them they had 6 including an infant.) \n\nWhen the three youngest each ended up crying the first night because they missed mom and dad? I went and got the littlest because they wouldn\u2019t settle. My husband went and got the pack n play to put in our room. And then each of the younger kids started to cry one after the other. So my husband went and picked them up, walked up and down the hallway, showing pictures, showing them our cats, shushing and comforting them\u2026 \n\nBy the time he had gone back and forth checking on them while I was giving the toddler a bottle and a diaper change\u2026three kids ended up in our bed cuddling me and he was sleeping on the floor. He wouldn\u2019t take the twin bed in the guest room the preschooler had been using because he wanted to be sure they were all okay. He grabbed an extra pillow and a throw blanket and fell asleep rubbing one of their backs and humming to us.\n\nThey weren\u2019t even our kids! And he still stepped completely up! I praised him and he told me that was the bare minimum for an uncle. He told me after that that when we have kids ourselves that he fully expects to take over when he comes home and to take shifts at night so I can sleep. He had a whole plan on how to keep me comfortable and supported. \n\nYTA. \n\nDo better OP. You\u2019re a weak ass person if AN UNCLE who is ACTUALLY BABYSITTING can sleep the whole weekend on a fucking hard floor because his wife\u2019s nephews and nieces are homesick.

Unfortunately it only worked a couple times when he was a newborn, but eventually he only wanted my breast. But my partner was very thoughtful and eventually started sleeping on the couch because of this exact same reason- he snored really bad and didn't want to keep me and our son awake. I ended up co-sleeping in the bed with my son because that was the *only* way I was able to get any sleep. He wanted to feed every hour or so. If I hadn't laid there and let him detach and fall asleep right where he was, I literally would've never slept. So luckily it worked for us.
