I dont want to be in social setting with my ex due to the pain of our relationship and the trauma it has left me. They told me I was being ridiculous and that I should suck it up for the day.

Your relationship with your ex sounds like it was pretty traumatic, and abuse leaves scars that can fade but may never go away. Still feeling the trauma doesn't mean you're not over him or that you're not ready for a new relationship.

Not that poor facsimile you keep holding up in your mind.", "NTA. I\u2019m really sorry you\u2019re having to deal with this. It\u2019s wild to me that your brother would keep someone in his life who hurt his sibling, let alone a known cheater, and I think it\u2019s unreasonable for people to expect you to put his feelings above your own when he seems to take zero consideration for you and the life you\u2019re building with your fianc\u00e9! Absolutely no one is entitled to details about your trauma from your ex, especially in justification for not wanting to be subjected to his presence. You\u2019ve said what you\u2019ve already said and that\u2019s justification enough. People who won\u2019t accept that don\u2019t deserve more of your energy. Also\u2014 I hope you do heal from what happened to you. You can absolutely be in a happy and healthy relationship with your fianc\u00e9 while healing from things that happened to you in the past and idea that you couldn\u2019t be in absurd. Just know that healing does not mean you have to allow your ex any access to your/your life!! Wishing you the best with maintaining this boundary and I hope your family wakes up and supports you the way you deserve!!", "I agree.  First loves are very special.", "sometimes it takes some time to work through trauma buddy. it\u2019s obvious she is trying to work through and that she has a good support system through her fianc\u00e9.", "A - She never said \u2018abusive\u2019. Literally never. \n\nB - She\u2019s not over him. This is clear with most words she writes. Being \u2018over\u2019 someone isn\u2019t just relegated to feelings of love. Shes \u2018happily engaged\u2019 to someone else, yet is contemplating not going to her brother\u2019s wedding because she\u2019s assuming he\u2019ll be the BM and imagining scenarios where she might be hurt or cause a scene by him trying to talk to her. \n\nThat\u2019s not being over someone.\n\nHad to laugh for jumping to claims of misogyny. My replies would have been the exact same had genders been reversed. Tell me, though, how anything I said falls under misogyny? Please.", "You most certainly will heal from your first love.  It just takes time.", ">I think you need to focus on indifference to this guy. As long as you keep carrying around that 'but he hurt me' torch he still has the power to set you back and steal your joy. \n\nThis! I would root OP on if she started realizing that the ex is merely a jerk, go to the reception, pay him no mind, support her brother and enjoy the party with her new love! She's giving the ex too much power and a little bit of control still.", "This needs to be at the top.", "I think we know he is not a loving and caring brother according to her other comments.  A lot of people think big brothers/sisters stick up for their younger siblings, because that\u2019s how their family worked.  Unfortunately, this is not true.   So bro\u2019s BF, who treated OP like shit, basically condoned his friend\u2019s behavior.", "She sounds delightful /s.   Go to the wedding and skip the reception.", "Oh, that's awful, I'm so sorry. It sounds like you're not going to get any family support on this except from your own partner. I'd say definitely skip the reception then. You can let your brother know you'll come to the wedding but not the reception of you think he won't blow up at you for it, but otherwise I'd say just quietly don't go and if anyone gets on you about it, just say \"I had personal reasons that I don't want to discuss, but my brother is aware of the situation so as far as I'm concerned the issue is closed.\" And then refuse to explain, justify, or defend yourself with anyone. Just keep repeating \"it's personal and private and I'm not interested in discussing it\"\n\nYou got this, and I wish you all the best in your continued healing"]}
