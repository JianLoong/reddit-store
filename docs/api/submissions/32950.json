It started casual and I ended up falling for him. He was my first ever real, adult relationship. But it was clear for a long time he didn't want the same thing.

My brother constantly brings up my ex to my fiance and even has mentioned to me that my ex says I was \"the one that got away\". Being that he is my brother's best friend, he will most likely be the best man. I have no problem supporting my brother's marriage and attending the ceremony. However, I'm not very comfortable with being in social setting (the reception) with my ex, where he may attempt to speak to me. The scars are too deep and the pain has not fully healed...

I dont want to be in social setting with my ex due to the pain of our relationship and the trauma it has left me. They told me I was being ridiculous and that I should suck it up for the day. That's what made me so conflicted about my decision. I know it's probably not a good look for me to leave so early and I also know my brother wants me to be there the whole day. I just dont want to be anywhere near my ex, but, at the same time, dont want to hurt my brother's feelings.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcements\n\n###[Happy Anniversary, AITA!](https://new.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15vlv9g/almost_better_than_a_double_rainbow_celebrating/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You're brother  may not understand but his fiance might", "NTA. This talk of \"the one that got away\" to your brother is a pretty narcissistic move. At least it is a majorly AHmove. He wants to live rent free in your head. Don't let him. Be happy with your fianc\u00e9 and erase your ex from your mind. He is nothing to you. Nothing good, at least.", "INFO If the scars/pain are too deep and not healed, is it wise that you\u2019re engaged to someone else?

He cheated on you, hurt you, but you got through that and are now \u2018happily engaged\u2019 to someone else.

What exactly would he confront him about? \n\nUltimately, you don\u2019t seem to be totally over this if you\u2019re willing to miss your brother\u2019s wedding (and accepting the burned bridges that come with that). \n\nI\u2019m not sure why you can\u2019t attend the ceremony and dinner at the reception, then leave after wishing them a congrats OP. And if anything is said, you just excuse yourself and leave gracefully. Just treat it like a mandatory work function- cool, professional, calm, ready to leave at any drama. I do think you\u2019re overthinking this. \n\nAnd I do think overthinking this is a natural response, though not a productive one. I imagine it was very confusing to be in a toxic relationship as a teenager, with a guy in his mid-twenties, that you probably trusted because he was your brother\u2019s best friend. Add to that, your brother essentially minimizing the impact this relationship had on you by still staying close with ex. I get it. \n\nBut I think you need to go-for yourself", "NTA - it\u2019s a great idea to support your brother by going to the ceremony.  Just let them know ahead of time that you\u2019ll have to miss the reception, so they don\u2019t buy you a plate. \n\nIt\u2019s also really weird how your brother tells your finance. Like why would he say that? Is he trying to get you and your ex back together?", "Nta", "NTA.\n\nBut I would talk to your brother and tell him at least a bit more. Otherwise, you might get hatemail from nosey relatives. He might think that things are better than he is aware of. \n\nI think if you truly think that this stresses you that much out, it is okay not to go. But if you talk to your brother, maybe they will at least find a way to keep you separated.", "NTA, but I think you\u2019ll regret not going and it could put a strain on your relationship with your brother.  Try seeing if you can go and have your fiance run interference anytime the ex might approach you.", "NTA. Your brother has shown who is more important in his life.", "YTA and if you don't go everyone, including your fiance, will know you still have feelings for him. Put your big girl pants on, show up, cling to your fiance and have fun. Living well is the best revenge.", "Have you spoken to your brother about any of this? It doesn't even sound like you've confirmed your ex will in fact be the best man. I get why you'd assume so, but you're contemplating bailing on your brother's wedding reception. That's a big call. Shouldn't you at least establish there is good reason for doing that?\n\nAlso, is your brother aware the idea of being accosted by your ex makes you uncomfortable? Would he consider telling his mate to keep away from you? Could your fianc\u00e9 and maybe a few other people make sure you're never left alone for him to corner you?\n\nI'm going to be a bit brassy and say you like the drama. Stop being that person. Just deal with this like a grown-up and communicate with a few key people about it. YTA for your immature attitude alone.", "You will be the asshole if you don\u2019t open that gaping whole in your head to communicate this to your brother. Once all that\u2019s been done then no you would be NTA. It\u2019s an invite not a summons. Doesn\u2019t matter whose wedding it is. But also understand that actions have consequences and your brother also wouldn\u2019t be the asshole if he went no or of with you. It\u2019s been years you should Atleast be able to be in the same room as him. Idk how you already haven\u2019t considering they\u2019re so close.

From what I read, you are just worrying about your image *with your ex* more than your brother's wedding you are supposed to celebrate.\n\nLET YOUR PAST GO!  What's the point that you bring up your past to your brother for what?  Does your boyfriend know that?  If yes, then what do you do??   Just chin up and smile with him.  Ignore your ex.  Your brother chose him as his best man, nothing you can do. \n\nNTA.  Whatever happens at wedding, it's on them, not you.", "YTA.\nSorry! But it\u2019s been 4 years and you are happily engaged. Can you not put aside your feelings for one day for the sake of your brothers incredibly important day?\nHonestly it sounds a bit melodramatic to me", "Well it's on you for even dating his best friend in the first place.

When we met, I had already come to turns with how my relationship ended with my ex. But you never truly heal from your first love. I have no sentimental feelings towards the man but the relationship had a huge impact on my life. And yes ive told my fiance all of this and he's been very loving and patient in wanting to help me heal and he shows me everyday what real love is. He also doesnt want to be confronted by my ex. My ex has even friended my fiance on socials and it really bothered my fiance he would do that. So overall not tryna have anything happen or come up at the wedding.

Time to let the past go and be there for your brother to celebrate his day.", "Thanks for your insight. I understand how it looks. But please keep in mind my ex was my first, real relationship. Its not that I have any sentimental feelings towards him at all. He was an asshole and i know that. But seeing him may not be healthy for me because of the trauma he's caused me. My fiance knows of all of this and even knows that I'm still in my healing phase. He still loves me and is very patient in helping me.

If she keeps getting put in situations that neither her or fiance are comfortable with, I don't see why she can't choose to not attend the reception. I think it's more she's worried that if she makes it clear she doesn't want to talk to them, it could bring attention away from the wedding celebration itself. I don't think it's unreasonable to not want to speak to an ex, especially one that cheated. NTA imo. OP, have a better conversation with your brother that if you did attend, you'd prefer to be left alone by his friend. Good luck.", "What a ridiculous comment.

You\u2019re not over the relationship.  You need to figure out how to make peace with that before anything else.  Also, your brother is a huge dick for still being friends with a guy who would do that to you.", "Bruh. You're clearly not over it. If seeing him is THIS big of a deal for you then you shouldn't even be engaged. That's crazy.", "Hey OP, I really don't understand some of these responses you're getting here. Your relationship with your ex sounds like it was pretty traumatic, and abuse leaves scars that can fade but may never go away. Still feeling the trauma doesn't mean you're not over him or that you're not ready for a new relationship. Especially since what you're concerned about isn't just seeing him, but worried that he'll come up to you and do something to reopen those scars and retraumatize you. That's a valid concern, and you're NTA for doing what you need to protect yourself. \n\nSounds like you've been as upfront with your brother as you can be (you don't owe anyone the minutia of trauma), and you've given him enough info that he knows his friend was horrible to you. He has clearly chosen his friend, so you can't trust him to be a buffer between him and your ex. I think you'd be NTA to go to the ceremony and not the reception.\n\nWhat is your relationship with his fiancee? Could you let her know directly that you won't be at the reception because for your own mental health you can't be in a social situation with your ex? That way you wouldn't have to worry about your brother twisting the message, and if anyone gets on you about not being there, you can just say \"I had personal reasons and I talked to the bride about it beforehand, so it's taken care of\"", "Go to your brothers wedding and stop over thinking this.", "I wouldn't want to be around friend who did that to my sister, why are you even going to the wedding? Your brother saying that to you is awful.", "If he is truly a loving and caring brother he will understand and take your feelings into account.  You need to tell him everything from that relationship so he fully understands why you feel the way you do.

I don't think OP cares about the ex as much as she cares about the ex trying to talk to her/approach her or her fiance. He sounds extremely narcissistic and low key petty.", "Thank you for your comment! In regards to your question about his fiance, I know a couple commentors have mentioned I should talk to his fiance. The last time I spoke to her about my ex, she basically told me that all my issues with my ex were my own fault for dating him in the first place. I dont think she would be very supportive or accepting of my not attending her reception."]}
