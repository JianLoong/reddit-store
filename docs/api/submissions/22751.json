When they got there her 5 year old daughter and my daughter went into her room to play.\n\nBecause she was there early I wasn't finished making the cupcakes for the party, so I told her she was more than welcome to join me in the kitchen or watch tv in the living room and make herself at home. She chose to stay in the living room and watch tv with her 14 month old. \n\nWhen I was in the kitchen I heard a loud bang noise and I immediately ran into the living room. My friends 14 month old was standing infront of my TV holding my friends umbrella and the tv was busted. My friend had went to the bathroom and left her 14 month old unattended in the living room. I don't have an open floor plan and can't see the living room from the kitchen so I didn't see anything and had no idea my friend left her alone. \n\nMy friend was very apologetic and offered to pay for the tv when it happened. After the party when I showed her the receipt for the tv and we were discussing it further she changed her mind because my tv was too expensive for her to replace, and she claimed I was taking that risk by inviting kids into my home. The tv was $1300 and I just bought it last month.\n\nIt's been almost a week since the party and she is refusing to reply to any of my texts or phone calls. My fiance is on my side about wanting the money back, but another friend of ours told us we were being harsh and we should cut her some slack and that we should expect things to get broken when we invite kids in the house. I personally feel like she should have been responsible and not left her daughter unattended in my home.

Any responsible adult who breaks an item should immediately offer to replace or pay for the item. Any responsible parent will do the same when their child breaks something.\n\nJust because it happens in your home doesn't make the breakage your responsibility. Talk about blaming the victim!

Yes, you assume some risk when you invite kids into your house, and if you had left glass figurines or clay pottery on the coffee table I'd say you were inviting disaster.

Who leaves a kid that young alone in a house that isn't their own?\n2. Yes the TV is expensive but part of having a kid is fixing the things they break. Was a payment plan offered? How much did she think the TV cost when she was okay with paying for it?\n3. \"that's what you get when you invite kids to your house\" No. Just no. I have been 4 and been to 4 year old birthday parties and TV's were not broken. If a 4 year old broke a TV, their parents would have to pay for it. \n4. Were you expecting the 14 month old or was it a \"oh! It's here. That's cool\"?", "NTA.\n\nCheck what warranty and such that you have! It's not uncommon on pricey TV's.\n\nBeyond that, you'd probably have to take your friend to small claims court. Not sure it'd be worth it. In any case I'd be severing that friendship. Your 14 month old destroying something expensive in my home followed up by you BLAMING ME FOR IT would be a signal for me to be done, and probably take some unfriendly/petty shots on the way out, especially if they cost money.", "NTA\n\nShe left the kid alone?

It doesn't matter if she is going through hard times.  She needs to be an adult about this.\n\nETA: the friend who said you should expect this, how much are the forking over?", "NTA. Yes things get broken when you have kids. That is normal. A kid taking an umbrella to a tv is not normal kid antics.", " NTA at all. You should NOT expect things to get broken if you have children in your house. It IS expected for your friend to WATCH HER OWN DANG CHILD and make sure it doesn\u2019t happen.

Yeah... NTA!!!", "NTA. Your former best friend is neither.  Sorry she bailed on repairing the damage from her kid.  Its fortunate no kids were injured due to her absence.  You won't get blood from the turnip.
