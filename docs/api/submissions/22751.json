If she didnt want to replace your 1300 tv then she shouldnt have left her 1 year old child alone with it.", "NTA! She agreed at first and then immediately reneged the moment she saw the bill?! In the least she could have agreed to pay it off in installments. Instead she\u2019s ghosting you. What a false friend!", "NTA\n\nI can see being to expensive to pay all at once but whatever amount she was comfortable with upfront (how much does she think a tv is) and then maybe some kind of payment plan. Which is still a dickmove as it doesn\u2019t immediately get you a TV but it is atleast reasonable", "She even knows she should pay because she offered to do so initially, she only retracted when she realised she can't afford to pay for the TV.", "I was just thinking how I would LOVE to see this on  Judy.", "Do the kids not get that anymore?", "You're right, but because of that legally the parents are liable for things their kids break. I'm not going to take it to court, but based off what I've read in the comments I easily could and she would be considered liable.", "They can't be held accountable, but their parent, who should have been watching them, can and should. It's literally that simple.", "I would have watched her too if she had just asked. The tv isn't mounted to the wall it was on an entertainment center, so we're lucky it didn't fall on her. That would have been awful! \ud83d\ude14", "Hell she could have brought the 14 month old to the bathroom with her! A mom never truly pees alone.", "If this was a case where the other parents weren't there and OP was the only one supervising the kids (like let's say OP invites their kid's friends over for a slumber party, that kind of scenario) then I would see the friend having a point about OP being liable, because OP is the adult who has taken responsibility for supervising the kids, but even so I would still think the parents have a responsibility to at least partially pay for damage caused by their kid because at the end of the day it's still their kid who did the damage.\n\nLike I don't have kids, but I have a cat, and if I asked someone to look after my cat while I'm away, and my cat damaged something in their house, I would pay for that damage even though I had no control over my cat in that moment. The only caveat would be if like the other person was doing something they shouldn't have done (like, IDK, hypothetically they scare the shit out of my cat on purpose) and that directly led to the damage, meaning they're responsible for it.", "And end the friendship .op is better off without such crappy 'friends' . NTA op", "Does not make it right. What if it was your friend that had the accident? I mean, accidents happen. Do you not have insurance?", "No body ever taught this guy the difference between fault and responsibility and it shows lol I guess we could let our kids run rampant in a fancy boutique, and dip on damages because it wasn\u2019t us breaking things, according to their logic.", "Childproofing is different at different ages.", "My thought exactly. I would have brought my 14 month old with me to the bathroom.", "Accidents happen, but just because something was an accident doesn't mean they shouldn't be held liable. I also don't consider this an accident. It never would have happened if she was watching her kid, so to me it was caused by negligence.", "For sure that would be bad. But this is a friend visiting your house. Shit happens"]}
