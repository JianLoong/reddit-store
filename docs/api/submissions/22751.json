In the least she could have agreed to pay it off in installments. Instead she\u2019s ghosting you. What a false friend!", "NTA\n\nI can see being to expensive to pay all at once but whatever amount she was comfortable with upfront (how much does she think a tv is) and then maybe some kind of payment plan.

It's literally that simple.", "I would have watched her too if she had just asked. The tv isn't mounted to the wall it was on an entertainment center, so we're lucky it didn't fall on her.

A mom never truly pees alone.", "If this was a case where the other parents weren't there and OP was the only one supervising the kids (like let's say OP invites their kid's friends over for a slumber party, that kind of scenario) then I would see the friend having a point about OP being liable, because OP is the adult who has taken responsibility for supervising the kids, but even so I would still think the parents have a responsibility to at least partially pay for damage caused by their kid because at the end of the day it's still their kid who did the damage.\n\nLike I don't have kids, but I have a cat, and if I asked someone to look after my cat while I'm away, and my cat damaged something in their house, I would pay for that damage even though I had no control over my cat in that moment. The only caveat would be if like the other person was doing something they shouldn't have done (like, IDK, hypothetically they scare the shit out of my cat on purpose) and that directly led to the damage, meaning they're responsible for it.", "And end the friendship .op is better off without such crappy 'friends' .

I would have brought my 14 month old with me to the bathroom.", "Accidents happen, but just because something was an accident doesn't mean they shouldn't be held liable. I also don't consider this an accident. It never would have happened if she was watching her kid, so to me it was caused by negligence.", "For sure that would be bad.

We were racing and distracted and didn\u2019t notice my son grab the antennae for balance. He broke the bracket. We immediately offered to pay for the parts and install a new one. Next time we saw them, the owner had found the bracket and replaced it (was a simple fix). We reimbursed him accordingly.

Her children are not Acts of God that nobody can control or account for.", "NTA\n\n> she claimed I was taking that risk by inviting kids into my home\n\nNo, the biggest risk was inviting in someone who leaves her children unattended and then doesn't want to take responsibility for her actions and by extension, her children's actions. This is not a friendship worth keeping, OP.", "NTA I would write the friend off though.  She will not reimburse you for the t.v. and she is a negligent mother.  She obviously doesn't care if your belongings are destroyed and your friends don't either.  Wait until it happens to them.", "NTA\n\nHow did you pay for the TV? Some credit cards pay for accidental breakage in the first 30 days or so.", "NTA. Having kids in your home does not qualify as \"assumed risk.\" Your friend offered to pay for it as well. Not to mention you DO NOT leave toddlers unattended. My cousin's toddler was left unattended by a babysitter for 2 minutes and she ended up passing away as a result. Your friend's toddler could have been electrocuted. That's your friend's fault. Take her to small claims.

Entirely different situations.", "Childproofing at 14m and 4 years is very different. \n\n\nI have a 15m old, it's so hard to protect him specifically from all the things my 3 year old plays with.

The guilty party pays for the TV, not OP's insurance.", "Still hard disagree from me. Like, if you had a party and was playing music from your laptop and someone spilled their drink in it. Would you demand they pay for that?", "NTA at all, her kid broke it because they were left unattended and somehow managed to american psycho the TV with an umbrella. BUT, just out of curiosity, what makes the TV $1,300? I just bought a giant smart TV for $600 and I really don't understand spending that much money on a TV. No judgment on you at all, live your best life. I'm just maybe thinking she thought it would be in the more \\~normal price range for a TV these days and offered to pay for it until realizing it was much more than that. She's still TA but just worth considering.", "Haven\u2019t seen anything in the comments that I wouldn\u2019t have said myself but I do have a possible solution (maybe)\u2026 see if she\u2019s willing to give you the $1300 over the course of like a month or something this way the payment isnt all at once and might be easier. Sure itll mean more time without a tv but you would be getting the money back if she agrees to it\n\nalso btw NTA", "Don't ask, demand.
