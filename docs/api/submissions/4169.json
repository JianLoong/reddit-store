The first 3 weeks I have been here I have heard lots of horror stories around a member of the office we will call J. I've heard that the last 2 people that took this position were basically bullied out of the post by J and that anybody who makes any complaints to HR basically get told to put up and shut up for two reasons. Firstly J, despite not being the most popular person in the office, is very good at what she does to the point the company sees her as invaluable and secondly, J is a wheelchair user and is apparently very quick to throw the discrimination card around as soon as something doesn't go her way.\n\nAnother key point to this tale is that I use a stoma bag and have done since I was a baby.\n\nAnyway this week is the first week I have interacted with J as she was on annual leave for my first 3 weeks with the company. I was using the disabled bathroom to empty my bag when I started hearing a loud banging on the door. I said one moment and opened the door to a lady in a wheelchair, the infamous J. I was berated for about 5 minutes things such as \"why is a healthy young man using a disabled bathroom I should be ashamed, etc\" drawing the attention of everyone in the nearby vicinity before she even let me speak. I eventually got a word in, reminded her that not all disabilities are blatantly obvious and lifted my shirt up to show her my bag. She went bright red and I got on with my day. \n\nThe next day I go to use the disabled bathroom to find a poster on the door saying \"wheelchair users only\".I didn't make a huge fuss but happened to mention to the colleague across the table from me \"have you seen J's latest stunt\". This is the woman who told me to watch out for J initially \n\nI go home for the day and return the next to an email saying to report to HR as soon as I clock in. I get in there to be told that I am receiving a verbal warning as my \"tittle-tattle\" in the office caused a huge bust up between J and my mentor.J was in the office and smirking all the while. I lost my cool and told J that the only reason she is still in a job is because of how long she had been with the business and that she isn't going to bully me out of my position like she had my 2 predecessors. I also told her that I apologise that she has been dealt a bad hand but that it doesn't give her the right to treat people like shit and that she is no longer the only disabled person in the office so she isn't going to keep getting away with her stunts. \n\nI then told HR about the bathroom incident and what followed. Eventually J was suspended pending investigation\n\nI must admit I felt great on the day but as the week has gone on I can't help but feel guilty. I wanted to teach her a bit of a lesson not put her job at risk in times like we are having (cost of living crisis, etc). \n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1670424273, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zf2twl/aita_for_telling_a_colleague_their_disability_is/", "score": 428, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This karma is her own doing, not yours. Well done for standing up for yourself, not to mention fellow disabled people (some of which may also be in your office and you just don't know!).", "NTA. *She* is the one who put her job at risk, not you.

My disabilities are not external and someone like J would never be able to understand.", "NTA\n\nLOLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL \n\nI love that she tried this at a LAW FIRM. If anyone is going to be compliant... whew.", "NTA. \n\nBullies come in all shapes and sizes, so if they have a card they will use against you, they gladly will. Because she got red when you showed her your situation, she knew she was in the wrong, so she was trying to do what most people realize. Make a complaint against you before you can lodge and complain against them, then generally the first person they complains is the one that gets listened to.\n\nSame thing generally happens with calls to 911\n\nEdit: I'm pretty sure a restroom marked for handicap persons, cannot be limited to only one handicap. And especially with this being a law firm, anybody that sees that probably knows that's a huge liability for whoever changed it", "NTA.

I'd argue that needing to empty your bag was vastly more important than whatever she needed to do in, what she thought, was her own private bathroom.\n\n*You* did not get her suspended, she did that herself when she tried to start a fight in the bathroom.

From a fellow bag wearer, good for you!", "First of all, no one gets to decide who can and cannot use the handicap accessible restroom.  Yes, priority should be given to those with disability, but it can be used by persons without disability if no one else is using it.\n\nSecond, as others have said, that sign is illegal.

Being disabled doesn't give you a free pass to be mean to others.", "NTA, and she was being extremely rude confronting you like that.", "NTA Your coworker over played her hand. No law firm wants to defend a complaint about a hostile work environment or discrimination against people with disabilities. Her antics are the reason she has been suspended pending further investigation.

She did this, not you.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t endanger her job, she did.", "NTA\n\nYou shined a light on her behavior. \n\nEverything else is fallout from her own choices. \n\nYou weren\u2019t malicious or exaggerating. You told what happened. No reason to feel guilty. Hopefully she will learn something.", "NTA\n\nPeople often make excuses for assholes in society. I\u2019ve seen it time and time again.

It\u2019s just easier if I faint, it\u2019s less risk of hitting my head. But it\u2019s an invisible disability.

Sounds like there are a lot of witnesses to her behavior. And the employers are allowing this to happen.  I would also talk to a lawyer about a hostile work environment.

But also remember HR, is not your friend either.\n\nFrom now on, keep things strictly professional and documented with her and no extraneous comments.", "NTA. Her actions put her job at risk.

Talking to anyone else is just gossip and can\u2019t solve the problem.   That doesn\u2019t put you in the best light either.", "NTA \n\nFirst of all, you were more than generous by actually showing her your bag and \u201cproving\u201d your disability. In your shoes I would have simply said that not all disabilities are visible and I have a legitimate need to use the bathroom. \n\nYou SHOULD have complained to HR about getting harassed for being disabled because that is exactly what J did. The company suspended J because they KNOW the potential liability of allowing an employee to harass another employee BECAUSE of their disability. Furthermore, denying access to reasonable accommodation is not legally ambiguous\u2014it\u2019s a slam dunk lawsuit. J tried to create a company policy that ADA only applies to her disability. THAT is why she\u2019s suspended.", "That sign is illegal. Seriously. If a disabled bathroom has a sign that says \"x people only\" it's massively illegal.
