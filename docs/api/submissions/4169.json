The first 3 weeks I have been here I have heard lots of horror stories around a member of the office we will call J. I've heard that the last 2 people that took this position were basically bullied out of the post by J and that anybody who makes any complaints to HR basically get told to put up and shut up for two reasons. Firstly J, despite not being the most popular person in the office, is very good at what she does to the point the company sees her as invaluable and secondly, J is a wheelchair user and is apparently very quick to throw the discrimination card around as soon as something doesn't go her way.\n\nAnother key point to this tale is that I use a stoma bag and have done since I was a baby.\n\nAnyway this week is the first week I have interacted with J as she was on annual leave for my first 3 weeks with the company. I was using the disabled bathroom to empty my bag when I started hearing a loud banging on the door. I said one moment and opened the door to a lady in a wheelchair, the infamous J. I was berated for about 5 minutes things such as \"why is a healthy young man using a disabled bathroom I should be ashamed, etc\" drawing the attention of everyone in the nearby vicinity before she even let me speak. I eventually got a word in, reminded her that not all disabilities are blatantly obvious and lifted my shirt up to show her my bag. She went bright red and I got on with my day. \n\nThe next day I go to use the disabled bathroom to find a poster on the door saying \"wheelchair users only\".I didn't make a huge fuss but happened to mention to the colleague across the table from me \"have you seen J's latest stunt\". This is the woman who told me to watch out for J initially \n\nI go home for the day and return the next to an email saying to report to HR as soon as I clock in. I get in there to be told that I am receiving a verbal warning as my \"tittle-tattle\" in the office caused a huge bust up between J and my mentor.J was in the office and smirking all the while. I lost my cool and told J that the only reason she is still in a job is because of how long she had been with the business and that she isn't going to bully me out of my position like she had my 2 predecessors. I also told her that I apologise that she has been dealt a bad hand but that it doesn't give her the right to treat people like shit and that she is no longer the only disabled person in the office so she isn't going to keep getting away with her stunts. \n\nI then told HR about the bathroom incident and what followed. Eventually J was suspended pending investigation\n\nI must admit I felt great on the day but as the week has gone on I can't help but feel guilty. I wanted to teach her a bit of a lesson not put her job at risk in times like we are having (cost of living crisis, etc). \n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1670424273, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zf2twl/aita_for_telling_a_colleague_their_disability_is/", "score": 1938, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Because she got red when you showed her your situation, she knew she was in the wrong, so she was trying to do what most people realize. Make a complaint against you before you can lodge and complain against them, then generally the first person they complains is the one that gets listened to.\n\nSame thing generally happens with calls to 911\n\nEdit: I'm pretty sure a restroom marked for handicap persons, cannot be limited to only one handicap.

The company suspended J because they KNOW the potential liability of allowing an employee to harass another employee BECAUSE of their disability. Furthermore, denying access to reasonable accommodation is not legally ambiguous\u2014it\u2019s a slam dunk lawsuit. J tried to create a company policy that ADA only applies to her disability. THAT is why she\u2019s suspended.", "That sign is illegal. Seriously. If a disabled bathroom has a sign that says \"x people only\" it's massively illegal.

Some people just don\u2019t get many breaks", "I have been known to use the disabled stall because of my kids. I'm not going to leave them alone - they're 4 and 2. And the small stalls just aren't big enough for 3 people. Also, that's usually where the changing table is located.", "Disabled person here: you are correct. Pretty much unless you see someone who clearly needs the larger space (be it a wheelchair user or a parent with a stroller), you are free to use it.", "People don't understand the difference between bathrooms - which must be accessable - and parking spaces - which are restricted.\n\nA disabled parking space can only be used by someone with a proper tag or license plate proving they are disabled.\n\nA disabled bathroom stall has to be accessible, but anyone can use it.  Otherwise what would you do it the bathroom only has the one stall? Not let anyone use it?", "Yeah, anyone can use them, but generally you shouldn't, just on the chance that somebody who does actually need to use it can. Even though a quick piss may not take much time, do keep that in mind.\n\nEta: I guess I should say that I meant a piss is fine since it doesn't take a while, but generally if there are open stalls you shouldn't take a handicapped one. I don't think it's really an issue at all unless you're going to be taking a long time in there and avoid open stalls for that one.", "Disabled and still annoyed that the disabled stall is usually in the back! It\u2019s like asking for ice and being directed to Mt Everest", "Bad bot!\n\nThis bot is copying part of u/tartymae's comment a little down the page.", "Have they revoked your verbal warning?", "Lol so comparing you two is apples to oranges. Yea, do everyone a favor (including J) and get them fired. Nobody learns until they lose something", "This is probably too much info for the internet", "My unit where I work has a gender neutral ADA compliant \"family\" bathroom with a changing table.  Meets everybody's needs.", "that's actually kind of annoying.  those aren't the same thing and someone with a disability may not be able to wait 20 minutes for a diaper change and feeding.", "This! It isn't \"disabled folk only\" it's \"accessible\"\n\nEveryone still has to wait in line to piss.", "My take is anyone can use it, but if someone who can only use that stall* comes in, they go straight to the top of the line and are next to use the accessible stall. Then it goes back into rotation. Let's be accommodating AND efficient. \n\n*In my mind this is pregnant people and people with small children, as well. Everything is harder when you're dealing with medical needs or children.", ">but older buildings, I can't see how the average person can get into those stalls without performing a bit of body contortion.\n\nI think it's because when those buildings were made, the average person was smaller.  People are taller now too.  I grew up in a house built in 1900, the doorways are inches lower than the home I own (built closer to 1970).  My dad had an 1800s farm house and had to duck to go between rooms.  We're just getting bigger, in every way.", "I'm overweight but not obese. Some bathroom stalls are a joke. Especially once you've crammed a sanitRy bin in there too. You have to practixally climb over the loo to shut the door, perform Circ du Soleil levels of acrobatics to pee, and then practically boulder your way out again. Then heaven forbid there's two way traffic trying to get through the tiny corridor that is both access to toilets, sinks, hand dryers and the only space to queue!", "I'm very sorry for your loss, thanks for sharing that story", "Exactly and it's not hard to be an ass about it either. I was waiting for a bathroom and most of the toilets were broken, except one normal stall and a handicapped one. The lady behind me who came up happened to be a wheelchair user, and the handicap stall opened up first so I just let the woman behind me go because I knew the other stall would be open shortly. Sure enough, before the woman even locked the door for the handicap stall, the other stall was available.\n\nShe was even super respectful, asking me if I was sure when I told her she could go ahead.", "It's called waiting your turn. If the non-handicapped stalls can have a wait line so can the handicapped ones", "The bathrooms aren't outfitted for feeding where I am. It's legal to breastfeed anywhere that is public. \n\nIt's mostly called a family bathroom because there's more room for your toddler to stand there while you use the bathroom yourself. Also, I have a 10-month-old and diaper changes take less than 5 minutes. I timed myself once and it took a minute and a half.", "Usually those aren\u2019t the only bathrooms available, but they are helpful for a disabled person who needs a caregiver\u2019s assistance. What would you expect someone to do if more than one disabled person needed the restroom at the same time? They still have to wait. Same with mothers who have multiple children with them or really need the changing table that\u2019s in the disability stall.", "But they said they pick the one farthest away from others, meaning they could be using a handicapped stall and leaving the other ones open. Restrooms usually only have 1 handicapped stall with multiple not. If there's a bunch of people already and waiting or whatever sure I guess, but when there is actually free and open stalls they can use, they shouldn't take up that spot. But like I said, a quick piss doesn't take much time, so it isn't much of a problem. It would actually be an issue if they are planning to actually take a long time in there and actively avoid the other open stalls.", "As someone in a wheelchair, I appreciate family/gender neutral bathrooms soooooo much! I know where all the bathrooms are to places I go to frequently, and it makes me feel safe. Just because a restroom has a handicap stall doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s big enough to fit my wheelchair. I don\u2019t have to worry about leaving in the middle of something because I can\u2019t fit in the stall. I probably know every Starbucks in a 20 mile radius, because I have to be prepared if I\u2019m going somewhere unfamiliar, and don\u2019t know the restroom situation. I appreciate that all their bathrooms are a single room.", "I have had to use crutches and braces before and usually the toilets in the \"family\" bathrooms are lower and we're so much easier to use. Plus there was room for my crutches. \n\nGetting honest answers about accessibility is so difficult too. Because no the tiny stall with a handrail isn't really accessible to anyone in a wheelchair, forget scooters."]}
