He kept saying that he wanted to get me something id actually use etc and so i ended up telling him i wanted AirPods (he's not a apple fan). He said they suck and offered to buy me bluetooth earphone of another brand. I very boldly refused and told him that i really don't want any other brand I am fine with no gifts over getting something that i didn't want and wasn't going to use anyway. Just a back story....I've used other bluetooth earphones before and just not liked them as much.....i cant afford AirPods so ive been using wired earphone because i don't like buying things i don't fully like.fast forward today....the gift arrived and it was indeed earphones of the brand i didn't like and want. I pretended like I was really happy and i loved them, but the reality is that I'm really upset to the point i cried. I dont see what was the point of getting me something i so very clearly didn't want. I dont plan on telling him that this upset me but i feel like a real asshole for being mad at him. I wouldve been fine with no gift but now im forced to use something i don't want to.\n\nIt just feels like he went out of his way to make me unhappy and he's teasing me saying they're not airpods so you probably dont like em and i just laugh em off . I thought of telling him that i wanted to return them because it just feels like a waste of money, my sister told me that would be a shitty move and that i should just keep them and be grateful.\n\nHe's going to expect me to use them which im not going to want to. He's going to keep asking me about it and im not very good at hiding my dislike towards things. I just feel kinda mad at him and also at myself because i feel like a shitty ungrateful brat\n\n EDIT : I can see why everyone would think he's being disrespectful but he's really nice and he respects me and my needs. He always predicts what i want and he's given me some of the most thoughtful gifts and maybe thats why this hurt me so much because i was expecting something similar and just felt like old times with my parents where gift giving was always upsetting. He's always given me the nicest things and he's not stingy with money at all.", "created_utc": 1698084098, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17eqq8h/aita_for_getting_upset_over_a_birthday_gift_my/", "score": 11, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Tell your boyfriend you appreciate the gift but you're not going to use them so he can return them or give them to someone else who will use them. Don't let him try to be Mr Pouty or Mr Hurt Feelings, he deliberately got you something you did not want. It's not loving or considerate to get someone a gift they expressly said they did not want, it's being an ass for the sake of being an ass.", "ESH. He's def an AH for explicitly ignoring your feedback that you don't want something and getting it for you anyway as if he knows better \"homer Simpson gifting his wife a bowling ball\".  But YTA for just pretending that you loved it and not being honest with him. I'm all for not looking a gift horse in the mouth. But this isn't about him just missing the mark on a gift, it's about him literally ignoring what you've said about gifts and deciding you should like something you don't, just because he does. And that just because he thinks something sucks then you shouldn't like it. That's some bullshit that he needs called out on.", "NTA. But if he bought you like the Bose ones that are better than AirPods I wouldn\u2019t really complain lol. Like if he actually knows about audio etc and depending on the AirPods I would understand not wanting to pay $250 for the AirPods if the Bose are around the same price and better from an Audio perspective . Still NTA for your preference though.   (Someone who literally just bought AirPods)", "just give them back. when giving gifts it\u2019s the thought that counts, and when the gift you give is the one and only thing you\u2019ve been explicitly told is absolutely unwanted, it\u2019s not a good thought. \u201ci thought about it, and i appeciate that you wanted to give me a gift, but i told you this is the only thing i don\u2019t want, so i\u2019m not going to keep them. i hope you can get your money back, or use them yourself.\u201d\n\ni suspect this was not so much done \u201cwith love\u201d as it was to prove a point and prove you wrong. nta.", "If he's not going to listen to what you actually want, then break up with him and sell the earphones that you didn't want and get the money back from them", "Info: Have you ever used this brand before or are you simply saying it's not Apple you don't want it?", "ESH- I was with you all the way until you backed off your original very understandable position- you've actually tested this stuff out and it doesn't work for you. Your bf sucks for insisting on getting you the thing you very explicitly told him not to. Your response should have been to question why he got you exactly what you told him not to, or a gentle \"thanks, but I can't use these\" and hand it back to him. Instead you LIED and play-acted like it was great, being a total ah to yourself, and making him feel like ignoring your wishes was a great idea. Stop being a doormat and tell him the truth.", "NTA. You were clear with him that you didn\u2019t want those. I would ask him to return them, and remind him of the conversation you had.", "NTA. It's hurtful to feel like your partner doesn't listen or pay attention to the things you say or like, etc. \n\nWhen I was living with my first serious bf, we discussed Christmas gifts and I told him I wanted a particular jacket in ANY color besides black. Guess what color he gets me? Black. The only color I didn't want. That I explicitly told him I didn't want. I appreciated him getting me a gift at all, but it was hurtful to realize he did not pay attention to the one thing I asked for. A simple request. He was very.. unstable.. Glad I'm no longer with him.", "He's a jerk and I would tell him it was the same as no gift and that's just fine. Maybe he can return them. You shouldn't have pretended you were happy with them.", "NTA.\n\nAnd please listen, while he might have been great in the past, what he\u2019s done now is disrespectful, and just plain mean with teasing you about it.\n\nYou should have shown your disappointment and handed them back at the point he gifted them, saying you\u2019d been clear he shouldn\u2019t waste his money on something you\u2019d never use.\n\nNot making it a big deal, just firm.\n\nUnless it was gifted in front of people. Then idve waited until you were alone.", "NTA, but if he really respected your needs he would have gotten you what you wanted. Stop lying to yourself.", "NTA you've made it clear you didn't want them before he got them , he knew your stance on it . \n\nI actually wish more people were honest about gifts they didn't like - for years I've been buying my partner expensive joggers and trainers because he always seemed really appreciative of them and recently he had a clear out and got rid of them \ud83d\ude43 such a waste of my money .", "NTA. If you hadn't told him that you only wanted Apple, I'd chalk it up to a misunderstanding. But he didn't get you a present. He got himself the present of showing you that he knows better. I don't particularly like Apple and I don't think they make great headphones but you're allowed to like whatever you want. I have bought tech for a really specific reason and it would annoy the heck out of me to have someone tell me to get something else. Give the headphones back. He likes them and you don't.", "NTA. Listen to us....he is being disrespectful. He thinks your opinion is invalid and is going to show you he is right.", "NTA.  That's just a crappy position to be put in, but here's what you do.  Wear them periodically for a couple of weeks and then 'lose' one.  Ask him if it has the location feature like air pods, and then go from there! \ud83d\ude06", "This is like saying you want a certain bike as a kid then you\u2019re parents get you a slightly different one that functions the exact same way and bitching about it.", "NTA, although you shouldn't have acted like you enjoyed them.  \nHe doesn't like apple products and that's fair for him.  \nBut speaking from experience as both a heavy user of Apple and Android, I've never had a problem with my Apple devices all working together. The same can't be said for my Android devices.  \nIt's all about preference, and in this case, he's not respecting yours.", "NTA, why are you with someone that obviously doesn't respect you?", "NTA\n\nPut them aside and don't use them. This was a power move on his part. \n\n>He said they suck and offered to buy me bluetooth earphone of another brand. I very boldly refused and told him that i really don't want any other brand I am fine with no gifts over getting something that i didn't want and wasn't going to use anyway. \n\n\nWhen he asks for Nikes for his bday, get him Pumas instead. Or whatever. You know what I mean lol.", "NTA...  you clearly communicated what you did and did not want, and he ignored you.  So, nip this one in the bud...  ask him to return them and get the AirPods.  Better yet...   both of you go, then you can pick out exactly the type you want.", "On the fence for ESH.. He asked you a question but ignored your response. However, you're asking for an expensive gift, that you can't afford yourself. You said he wasn't doing it out of disrespect or ill will, so perhaps that was all he could afford. \n\nThe only options you gave him were airpods or no gift. Imo, if he had opted to get you nothing, this post would have a totally different storyline and heading.", "NTA - Usually, if you get a gift you don't like, and the gifter doesn't offer a gift receipt, then I think the politest thing to do is thank them, and then either try to sell or regift the item.  But, the difference here is 1) your boyfriend knew you didn't want this specific brand, and he completely disregarded your very strong preference and got them for you anyways; and 2) because he is your boyfriend, it's not so easy to simply resell/regift without him knowing and potentially getting upset.  \n\nSo for those reasons, I advocate for honesty.  I would tell him that while you appreciate the money he spent, you don't want them to go to waste.  I'd offer that he either return them himself, or you will try and sell them, or he can simply keep them, since he seems to like the brand so much.  If he gets upset, well too bad; he is the one who disregarded your opinion and tried to force you to accept something that you were clear you didn't want.  But letting this fester isn't great for your relationship.", "NTA about being upset he got you a gift you clearly didn't want.  That makes perfect sense.  But you are an adult and are in a relationship it sounds like is important to you.  I'd question his feelings towards me if I was you.  But you need to be honest with him.  It does you absolutely no good and won't help your relationship if you downplay how you feel and your sister's advice is just wrong.  Do not lie to him.\n\nYou don't need to scream and yell at him or get angry or agitated.  But you do need to say \"look, I asked you not to get me these earbuds because I won't wear them.   You got them anyway.  I care enough about you that I don't want to waste your money.  I will never wear these earbuds.  They don't fit properly and I don't like them.  So I would like to know where you got them and the receipt so I can return them.  I would love to take the refund and apply it towards something I love that will always remind me of you.  Or if you just want the money back, that is fine.  But right now, whatever you paid for these is wasted on me. And that isn't fair to you or me.\"", "ESH\n\nBF's making fun of you, you're about to cry over not getting a specific brand of earphones because you have fallen into the apple marketing trap of \"apple or gtfo\". \n\nY'all need to grow up", "NTA", "thanks for the wish!!", "ive used the previous gen of these same earphones......", "i want to but i dont want to hurt his feelings.....also AirPods are way more expensive than these so i dont want to be insistent. He has these same earphones and he was so excited that we have the same earphone and i just didn't feel like bursting his bubble", "ahahah this made me smile :))", "crocs or uggs. he sounds like he\u2019d hate that.", "How exactly is OP the asshole? \n\nJust because other people don't like Apple products that doesn't make OP an asshole for wanting what they want, apple or otherwise.", "Won't call you an asshole but instead of saying I don't like them why not try them out first?", "Maybe he couldn\u2019t afford the AirPods then if there was a large price discrepency? Seems like it might be him just thinking anything\u2019s better than corded ear phones. (Not defending him not listening to you)", "Where was his regard for your feelings when he completely ignored what you said and got you something you told him very clearly you wouldn't like? If his feelings are hurt because he ignored what you said who's fault is that? Then you had to muddy up a crystal clear situation by lying about it. You've tried his brand and they do not work for you, there is zero reason to feel guilty for a personal preference. Hand him back the gift, apologize for almost making him waste his money, and start yourself an airpod fund to save to get your own. And work on not being such a people pleaser.", "Why are you more concerned about hurting his feelings than you are about him hurting yours?  \n\nYou explicitly told him what you wanted.  He had the option to get you nothing by your own statement, and STILL got you what HE wanted.  He doesn't respect your opinion or your feelings.", "Glad to hear! Always scared how jokes are going to go over on here.  Also, making a point though - my Air Pods are the only Apple product I own, and that's a huge reason why.  I dont even want to spend $50 on something so easy to lose.  Not even mentioning all the other ways they're better...", "Or, hear me out, accept that someone might actually know what they want, and don't try to convince them otherwise, because YOU like a different product more.", "Ok hear me out. If someone buys you something before complaining that you don't like it.....try it out and see if you like it.  What if she uses them and fall in love with the headphones. \n\nI'm not saying she's an asshole and truthfully the bf is wrong for getting them. But heck at least try them before saying I don't like it", "First, IDK where you buy things from, but everywhere I've been, once its used it's not returnable.  \n\nAside from that, I don't need to try every set of headphones on the planet to know that I want airpods.  I also don't need to explain why I want airpods.  That's my choice, and BF getting something different implies/says that BF thinks he knows better than me, and doesn't give a shit about my opinion.  Doesn't matter if BF likes airpods I DO.  \n\nIt's not about the iranian yogurt here.  It's about BF being a selfish dick.", "Why are you taking this so personal? Lol \n\nEither this same thing happened to you and it struck a nerve or you Op other account", "Wtf are you talking about. \n\nNo one is taking anything personal, except you. I\u2019m explaining why what bf did sucks. Clearly you just want everyone to agree with you."]}
