He always predicts what i want and he's given me some of the most thoughtful gifts and maybe thats why this hurt me so much because i was expecting something similar and just felt like old times with my parents where gift giving was always upsetting.

But, the difference here is 1) your boyfriend knew you didn't want this specific brand, and he completely disregarded your very strong preference and got them for you anyways; and 2) because he is your boyfriend, it's not so easy to simply resell/regift without him knowing and potentially getting upset.  \n\nSo for those reasons, I advocate for honesty.  I would tell him that while you appreciate the money he spent, you don't want them to go to waste.  I'd offer that he either return them himself, or you will try and sell them, or he can simply keep them, since he seems to like the brand so much.  If he gets upset, well too bad; he is the one who disregarded your opinion and tried to force you to accept something that you were clear you didn't want.  But letting this fester isn't great for your relationship.", "NTA about being upset he got you a gift you clearly didn't want.  That makes perfect sense.  But you are an adult and are in a relationship it sounds like is important to you.  I'd question his feelings towards me if I was you.  But you need to be honest with him.  It does you absolutely no good and won't help your relationship if you downplay how you feel and your sister's advice is just wrong.  Do not lie to him.\n\nYou don't need to scream and yell at him or get angry or agitated.  But you do need to say \"look, I asked you not to get me these earbuds because I won't wear them.   You got them anyway.  I care enough about you that I don't want to waste your money.  I will never wear these earbuds.  They don't fit properly and I don't like them.

She knew this and when she handed me the earrings she said \"I know you can't wear these, but I thought they were your style and bought them anyway.\" I think that was the beginning of the end. It was such a small moment but it made me realize she was always going to choose her wants over my needs. There were, of course, other red flags, but that was an epiphany moment.

It at least reads as if you have only shown gratitude and externally affirming behavior toward your boyfriend up to this point, and so I don't see how you could possibly be TA? \n\nHOWEVER... You could be TA if you are going to secretly stew on this, and blow up later about this or something else that triggers these same feelings. Better to very calmly and kindly say how you feel now with as few assumption on your part as to why he did what did. Something along the lines of...\n\n \"This gift, I really appreciate it. I know you put effort into picking it, but it's honestly making me feel sad and a little angry, because I feel like you ignored me when you bought it. It's not a big deal. I don't want to fight about it or anything. But that is how I feel.\"\n\nI REALLY identify with this post, especially after the edit, because I have a FANTASTIC spouse who is 99.9% very near perfect, and that means ANY time I'm mad at him I feel like TA. Even if I don't say anything about being upset. So what I use to do was try to bottle up my anger and then I would explode when I hit my limit. \n\nIt took a few years of couples therapy and a lot of individual therapy for me to realize, that YES he is incredible, and YES I am grateful, but NO that doesn't mean he is perfect or doesn't make mistakes, and I am doing myself and our relationship a disservice if I don't voice my honest feelings in a rational and supportive manner before things boil over. Ultimately, even if I hadn't had a bad temper back then, not being honest about my feelings was still creating distance in our marriage. \n\nSo... with all that in mind your BF is likely NTA either, but what he did was a bit of a \"power move,\" and you have every right to be upset. This is basically the gift equivalent of \"Well Actually...\" because he is indirectly stating that your headphone preference is wrong, and his is superior, and just ignoring you on a very base level. It's likely the ignoring, more than this disappointing gift, that is actually triggering you, but that's why you need to very delicately go ahead and work through this with him.

It\u2019s never been a problem. \n\nHe may have good intentions, but his logic is flawed here. Just because he thinks it\u2019s best doesn\u2019t mean he gets to disrespect you or supersede you. I don\u2019t think it was his intention, but it\u2019s not about the headphones. If he tells you exactly what he wants, would he be fine getting the opposite? I doubt it. What you wanted wasn\u2019t dangerous, which is the only reason I can see going against what you asked for. \n\nTalk to him about how it\u2019s not the headphones, but the decision to disregard your request because he thought he knew better. It\u2019s about respect, autonomy (he can\u2019t choose for you), and support. He pushed his own ideas on you, forcing you to adjust. That\u2019s not fair. I don\u2019t think he means to hurt you, I think he believes he\u2019s doing this for you, but is very ignorant and conceited. \n\nCommunicate with him and see what he says. You cannot disagree with the emotions of another. They feel what they feel. Even with good intentions, someone who cares for you will recognize how it hurts, apologize, and begin reconnection there. This last part is what my therapist tells me. She reminds me how I\u2019d feel if I unintentionally hurt someone I loved. You still empathize with them.", "Earbuds are a very personal thing and letting someone pick them for you is never great. NTA.", "NTA keep them in the box and just be honest with him. Say you understand how he doesn\u2019t like apple but it\u2019s what you like and what makes you more comfortable so you\u2019d like to exchange them please\nEnd of story as far as I am concerned", "NTA... But airpods aren't great.   Lotta hype.  There are better, not necessarily cheaper, but better earbuds out there.", "NTA - the point of gift giving is to be thoughtful. You specified you wanted AirPods. He refused because his own opinions and ego were more important than getting you something that you wanted (whether it be AirPods or nothing like you specified).\nIt isn\u2019t a nice thing to do to get someone a gift they said they specifically didn\u2019t want in general - the fact he\u2019s your boyfriend doesn\u2019t change that.", "Maybe he had already bought them before he asked.", "Nta return them and explain why.", "NTA. Be honest. You don\u2019t need to yell or cry, but I would tell him you don\u2019t plan on using the gift. I would ask if he wants to return them. You aren\u2019t being dramatic or entitled. There is literally no reason to give someone a gift they have specifically asked not to get.", "Happy Birthday!! \n\nNTA. He did disregard & disrespect you by buying you a gift he *knew* you did not want or would use just because he doesn\u2019t like Apple products. That\u2019s actually pretty selfish honestly. It doesn\u2019t necessarily mean he\u2019s a bad guy overall, but it\u2019s still pretty selfish and wasteful. \n\nI\u2019d be honest with him about it! If the two of you can\u2019t properly communicate with each other when situations like this occur, then you have bigger issues.", "Nta, and if he is as nice and respectful as you think he is he'll appreciate you telling him he messed up... Which he did", "NTA. Tell him you're saving up for airpods. So return them. If he wants, you'd appreciate the money to go towards airpods as a present and would be much appreciated", "YTA for accepting them and pretending, why can't you be honest with him? Imagine going thru your life like this with unwanted gifts and a man who doesn't listen to you, yikes.", "NTA but\u2026 you could try them? There are good earphones that aren\u2019t apple. Examine your motivation here. Do you only want apple ones because you only want apple ones? Maybe he really tried to find you a good pair that he could afford? I agree it\u2019s annoying but men do things like this because they care, even though I know it seems like he just won\u2019t listen to you. Like the whole \u201cmansplaining\u201d thing. Women often read it as condescension, and it can be, but when a man takes the time to explain or teach something to someone it means he actually really cares about that person. You know how lazy we are, right? :) \nHe got you a gift, he\u2019s trusting you to try them. If you reject the gift just because it\u2019s not exactly what you want that\u2019s your right, but it won\u2019t read well to him. Also, you know, talk to him. Ask him why he got them even though you asked him not to. You might be surprised.", "You are almost all idiots. No wonder most of you are lonely basement dwellers. \u201cDump him!\u201d \u201cHe doesn\u2019t respect you!\u201d \u201cRip his throat out, girrrl!\u201d\nOk I\u2019m exaggerating but fuck me, ITS HEADPHONES FOR A RANDOM BIRTHDAY. \n\nOP, get a grip. Either use them and see if his judgement IN THIS ONE CASE was, even slightly, better than yours, which isn\u2019t a crime or even bad, or\u2026 I don\u2019t know\u2026 feed him to the pigs? He didn\u2019t shit on your pillow. He did what all men do at some point which was dismiss your feelings on an unimportant subject. Think about it. You said either apple earphones or no earphones. Because reasons. He thought, that\u2019s stupid she should have earphones it will make her days better, once she has them she\u2019ll like them - I like the ones I have I\u2019ll get her some of those because I can\u2019t spend one millions dollars on an apple set. \n\nIf you think this is your worst birthday then I have bad news for you. Time and gravity are coming for you. Stop complaining.", "If you got mad at him and did smthn to make him feel bad about it, you would be the asshole. But you seem really calm and collective about it. No, I do not think your the asshole. He may be slightly, and he seems like a great guy and all but just cant respect some certain wishes which you may need to work on? Next time maybe ask for something you can both agree on, but I totally understand your feelings and you honestly handled this pretty well. :)", "NTA\n\n\nI\u2019ve been in similar situations, I\u2019ve dropped hints for months before birthday / Christmas about what *specifically* I\u2019d love to receive, and in decades of doing this with partners and very close family, I\u2019ve exactly once gotten any of those things, which is fine, it\u2019s a request, not a demand, and I\u2019m even okay with receiving nothing if they really can\u2019t afford / find what I\u2019d want.  \n\nBut when they give me things that either I\u2019ve shown no interest in ever, or actually something I\u2019ve said I *don\u2019t* want, or something that\u2019s a cheap knock-off of what I wanted, that\u2019s when it\u2019s upsetting. They either decided that they know better than me what I would want, or that this other version is \u2018superior\u2019 to what I requested. \n\n\nMy partner has Apple almost everything, but cannot wear AirPods because of how they dint fit in their ear, and I\u2019m the same way; we either wear other brands of earbuds that do fit us, or over-ear headphones. I would never consider buying them AirPods, because I know their feelings on them. \n\n\nIn your specific case, you say you say \u201che\u2019s thoughtful and predicts what I want\u201d, but here he knows exactly what you want, and insists on giving you a different version which you explicitly said you didn\u2019t want? Maybe he\u2019s just in the camp that hates Apple - there\u2019s a lot of that around - but the result is the same: after making a big deal about getting you something you\u2019d want and use, he ignored your opinion. Give him the blunt, honest, truth, and ask him why he bought you want you said you didn\u2019t want?", "NTA, but I think you will have to tell him you don't like them", "I had a coworker/ friend do this once. We agreed ahead of time we were going to give each other a specific item so we'd both be happy with what we got. I got her the item she wanted and she purposely got me a r shirt instead and laughed her ass off hoping I'd be mad because that's her jam. Watching people open disappointing gifts apparently. That was her downfall. She told me that and I was like oh that's fine Ive been eyeing this shirt for so long I could t justify buying it because it was being shipped from the US so exchange and everything made it extremely expensive and really not worth it so thanks. I stole her thunder and she no longer had her jollies. We drifted apart not long after that and she got let go from the job oddly enough because she's a nice girl but she gets an idea in her head and will railroad any other input. Even reasonable ones.\n\nThe funny thing is I didn't lie - I WAS happy with the shirt because I had been wanting it and the shipping plus exchange and all that she shirt costed probably more money in the end then the other item did. So it worked out for me anyways and she wasted her money because that shirt fell apart so damn fast.", "Agree. This just might be a fluke. After all, no one gets the perfect gift every time. However, it also might be that because boyfriend doesn't like Apple he will refuse to by ANYTHING Apple. That's a problem because he shouldn't be forcing his boundaries on OP. I get not wanting to support a company or business. Then don't support them but don't force others to not support them.", "[removed]", "i am quite upset over this ....way more than i expected myself to be....its not about what he didnt get me but more about what he got me....he couldve gotten me literally anything else in the world that i didnt care so much about and i wouldve been happy but this was the one decision i did not want made for me...... I dont really know how to approach this subject without sounding incredibly ungrateful and i dont want him to feel like he has to buy me something again because I am unhappy.", "Airpods are the only ones I've tried that fit my ears comfortably and stay in. I've tried Beats, Sony, and etymotics as well.

They handle differently.", "I cried when my grandma bought me a 300 dollar guitar. I cannot post and didn't want to learn.  I had just bought my husband one too. I wish she wouldn't have bought me anything because I never used it and this was 14 years ago.  I just felt so bad for hating it and guilty.", "Or drop one in the toilet \u201caccidentally\u201d", "Not much of a detective, eh?", "yes", "But those are different. What's the harm in trying them first so youll know? You already have it in your hands. Will the return be void?", "Ah okay, i understand your bf but i see where you are coming from (I also prefer Samsung and android by a lot over Apple).\n\nSo yeah, i understand that he wanted to give you the *best* for the money but he missed the mark, he should've bought the [Sony in-earphones](https://www.sony.com/lr/headphones/products/wf-1000xm4) if he really wanted the best for the money. But this is different, you have a lot of Apple products so it would make way more sence to buy the airpods i.m.o.\n\nYou are not wrong for being upset and NTA for wanting to return them, if possible talk with him before you can't return it.", "Only if the AirPods are the cruiser", "Ah, my bad. Just saw that. Hard to use reddit when you're still learning how to read.", "Oh welcome to the mens room, hippo :)", "If they don\u2019t like them they don\u2019t like them.

Tried walking on ice barefoot? Tried using spiked shoes? Tried 24hrs isolation? These are extreme example to show a point that there\u2019s certain thing you know you don\u2019t like from past experience or from reading the description, and you aren\u2019t required to try out every gift to tell them you don\u2019t like them", "Not saying anyone requires too I'm saying what's the harm?  Worst case scenario she doesn't like them, best case she has a new pair of headphones she likes. \n\nMost of your examples have negative consequences if they try it out but this case reminds of my nephew. Who screamed how he hates spaghetti when he never ate it before in his life. Then he tried it and liked it. \n\nI'm not saying OP has to try them, she's her own person and she can do what she wants. Im just saying it won't hurt to try them out", "You\u2019re being incredibly obtuse on purpose.
