The polite (and right) thing to do would have been to let them know you\u2019re moving out and that you would like their help finding someone to take your spot and pay your portion of the rent, and then have a discussion about what it means if you can\u2019t find someone. \n\nThis is also why everyone should always be on the lease - it protects everyone from situations like this where one AH just dips and leaves everyone else on the hook.", "YTA. 13 days notice isn't really enough time for them to find a replacement roommate.", "I mean that\\`s pretty quick and really doesn\\`t  leave them with time to find someone else. Just because you\\`re not legally obligated to give them proper notice doesn\\`t absolve you of the be a nice human clause. YTA", "YTA - That is not 30 days notice. If you gave notice on Monday, that would have been Nov.14. 30 days from that is Dec.14. Assuming that your rent period is monthly, your move out date would be Dec. 31. And you should be paying for all of Dec, even if you move out, unless you (and all your stuff) is out AND the replacement moves in before 31. Dec.", "Soft YTA. You never signed anything. You should rightfully have given 30 days notice as that is common courtesy. You gave them a little over 2 weeks notice, so they should keep two weeks worth of your security deposit to make up the difference.", "YTA. From a legal standpoint, you\u2019re in the clear, but this is still considered a dick move because you gave them very little notice to find a new roommate. Not cool.", "It\u2019s possible there are landlord/tenant laws requiring you to pay rent if you don\u2019t give 30 days notice. You should probably look into that in your jurisdiction. NAH.", "YTA. No lease doesn\u2019t need to mean you should not be a decent human being. You gave them weeks and you are offering an air fryer and some flowers?", "YTA. 30 days notice is customary and standard. You don't have to physically be there, but you're expected to stay on the hook.", "YTA.  Even though there's nothing legally you HAD to do, giving a couple weeks notice for people to get a new roommate, especially right before the holidays, is a crap move.  I can't believe you don't see the issue here with what a terrible financial position you've put them in.  Pull your head outta your booty.  It doesn't take a lease to consciously be a considerate person/roomate.", "Well you just handled this so freaking maturely I\u2019m shocked it feels uncomfortable/s\n\nOf course YTA, two weeks isn\u2019t a notice and you have an obligation to fulfill your verbal agreement on how long you will live or at least pay rent there.", "YTA\n\nYou should feel uncomfortable. You may not have a lease, but I would hope you at least have courtesy for other people, especially if the living situation has been fine up until now. It would be one thing if they were causing a unsafe or toxic environment, but I would have expected that to be mentioned in your post.\n\nWhat exactly were you expecting from them? You sent a text instead of telling them in person. Clearly no one in this situation worries about putting things in writing, so it\u2019s not about that. Even if it was, you could have followed up with the text after speaking to them in person. \n\nNow you\u2019re upset because they haven\u2019t approached you to discuss? Why would they bother? Their focus now is probably trying to find someone asap to take away as much of the financial burden that you\u2019re dumping on them as they can. \n\nLegally, you don\u2019t have a requirement to give them notice since there was no lease. Morally, that is a total dick move and a decent person would give at least 30 days.", "YTA. While you are in the clear legality-wise as you've never signed the lease, it's still a shitty thing to leave them scrambling to find a roommate in 2 weeks AND to inform them about you impending move-out by text. At least help them find someone to replace you with.", "yes YTA.  2 weeks notice is 2 weeks too little.  Needs to be 30 days.  you should 100% leave the air fryer or money for some your share of the rent.", "YTA, typical notice is 30 days from the end of the month, so you should be paying through end of Dec.", "YTA \n\nYou need to give them 30 days notice, you should pay for half of December to give them time to find a new roommate, otherwise you come off as selfish", "YTA. Notice of more than two weeks is normally a good idea.", "YTA for giving such short notice", "YTA for not giving them 30 days notice. But you don\u2019t have a lease in writing with them that gives term, so probably not actionable. Just leaves them in a bad state.", "NTA mostly because you never signed a lease. I would absolutely talk to your roommates though so that they know you are leaving and you will not be paying rent in December.", "NTA. With nothing in writing you are under no obligation to stay.", "I don't see why this is a big deal, you leave, you have the right to, you are making this seem like you are never allowed to leave them ever again and you know already you are not the asshole, i mean no one would be an asshole for leaving.", "Two weeks is brief notice, though.

Your not the butt for wanting to live with someone who you know and is cheaper in the long run. I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND looking yourself to find someone to take your spot in the 2 weeks you\u2019ve given them. That way they don\u2019t get fucked over for December and you don\u2019t have to pay December, otherwise you should pay for December.

You are not on a lease. They will keep your deposit.", "YTA. You're leaving them to make up your portion of the rent until they can find someone and only giving them two week's notice. Normal leasing agreements are 12 months, formal lease or not. You should pay the next month's rent and let them have that month to find someone else.  Live there or not for that month.", "NTA. You aren\u2019t going to be living there so obviously paying rent on it is stupid.", "Yes. 2 weeks and like 2 days notice.", "I see what you're saying. I just don't get why none of this was ever spoken of out loud? A month to month renter with no lease isn't committed. 30 days is better than two weeks definitely. But, I can't imagine not talking about it or ever asking: How long are you staying?\n\nThat little tiny part is a head scratcher for me.", "30 days notice would be applicable if she signed a lease or anything. She signed nothing. Technically in the eyes of the law she's a paying squatter. She can come and go as she pleases. I do agree that decent thing is to pay, but they, the roommates or landlord whichever, should have thought of that by making her sign something.

OP is being an asshole by giving her roommates only two weeks to replace her. \"Technically in the eyes of the law\" is irrelevant here.", "I don\u2019t think there is such a thing as a paying squatter. Part of the joy of being a squatter is not paying. A month to month tenancy is normally presumed under these circumstances.", "Thank you! This isn't \"Am I legally obligated\" it's AITA. There are plenty of things that are legal that still are dick moves. \n\nOP, YTA. 30 days notice is standard out of courtesy, if nothing else. If they can't find another roommate in the 2 weeks you gave them they are going to find extra money to cover your missing rent. That's a shitty thing to do to them right before the holidays when most people don't have extra money.", "It's honestly creepy how many people apparently base their entire moral system on whatever their local laws happen to be.", "Yeah I hear what you are saying but I see their age and if they have to live with other people that they don't know to be able to afford rent then I see the opportunity to move to a cheaper place with someone they know as a huge benefit to them.
