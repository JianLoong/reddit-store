I can admit I never liked the guy since they started dating but he's not a bad guy and he made her happy so I've always done my best to be kind and accepting.\n\nSis has depression. Has had for years, and Halloween yesterday was a bad day for her. She claimed it wasn't his fault, that she was just being overly emotional, but the fact of the matter is she was smiling and laughing for hours before he showed up, and within ten minutes of his arrival her mood had worsened. By the end of the night she was crying. \n\nOn our way home she said all she could think about was how this was supposed to finally be the year where she wasn't alone on Halloween, and how he had KNOWN how much it had meant to her, and how much it bothered her that she was yet again single on Halloween. She hasn't had a good one in years. And despite knowing this, he kept cracking jokes about them not being together anymore and it hurt her.\n\nI was pissed. I said as much. She begged me to let it go and I agreed because we were going home anyhow and it didn't matter.\n\nBut not 30minutes later he invited himself over and she of course let him in. He started off fine, then got snippy cause she wasn't in a good mood. I finally snapped and said \"if it bothers you so much that we're 'no fun' then why don't you f*cking go home? It's not like anyone asked you to be here!\"\n\nHe of course got defensive and it started a fight, and he eventually stormed out.\n\nNow sis is saying I'm the AH for starting a fight despite KNOWING she wasn't upset with him and that the fighting just made her feel worse and it was my fault.\n\nSo now she's in her room crying and I'm sitting upstairs trying to figure out if I'm really in the wrong.\n\nTldr: AITA for starting a fight with my sisters ex, after he upset her in the first place?", "created_utc": 1667284947, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yj160p/aita_for_starting_a_fight_with_my_sisters_ex/", "score": 3, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I get they were best friends, but right now they are ex\u2019s and need to give each other distance to deal with that. Your sister has not dealt with this if she got upset over being single on Halloween. Him going round to yours all the time is not healthy and it\u2019s preventing your sister from mentally moving on. Have a good chat with her and try to get her to realise that she needs to put some space between her and this guy for now, til she has dealt with the break up. In time they may strike up their friendship again but now, no. If he is still having such an effect on her mood then she needs to cut him out.", "Esh. I think it's wonderful to defend her like you do, but the truth is, she didn't want you to and the situation it created likely made her feel worse. It's hard watching someone you care for have feelings for a guy like that, but adding ugliness on top of ugliness won't help. Hang tight with her and hopefully soon she'll want you to defend her to him one last time for good", "NTA. He is hoovering. I hate him on your behalf. He's not her friend"]}
