They took the following actions.\n\nReported me to the bbb for fraud. I successfully defended myself and the bbb removed the complaint. They then posted over 6 1 star reviews on 4  different platforms (6+ reviews per platform). Reported my business as fraudulent to Google, Facebook and Instagram which resulted in my business listings being forcibly closed until I can prove I wasn't commiting fraud. Our website was also removed however we still own the domain our host is also requiring us to defend ourselves before the website will go live so I'm guessing they reported our website somehow. \n\nOf the 27 clients we had totaling over 300k we only have 1 client left valued at 4100. The remaining canceled and several sighted the reviews and our business information being gone.\n\n2. In our state Im permitted to file a mechanics lean for all value added work. Basically if it adds value to the home I can file a mechanics lean if the invoice is unpaid. I then have 6 months to file for a writ of execution to cure my mechanics lean. This means in my state I file for a writ of execution where the real property i have a lean on is seized and sold by the county at auction to cure the lean.\n\nIt's a bit different than a mortgage.
