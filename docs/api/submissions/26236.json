It\u2018s my first time off since the beginning of may, to say i am thrilled is an understatement. We plan to party at night and chill at the pool by day.\n\nI also told my brother (43) and my SIL (39) a few weeks ago that i was really excited to stay in this specific hotel since it is on the pricier end.\n\nYesterday my Brother contacted me that they will be staying in the same Hotel with my niece (4) at same time as me.\n\nIn the message he wrote me that they are also really excited that i can help with my niece since i am also there and they can relax in the meantime and according to them i have nothing better to do. Do not get me wrong i love my  niece to pieces, but i really want to enjoy this Weekend and not have any responsibility for anyone besides myself. I want to relax, be drunk and have fun with my friends. They are staying in the same hotel so i can\u2018t avoid them even if i wanted to.\n\nThe vacation is not refundable. I am either stuck with babysitting(her parents are really pushy and i am the worst at setting boundaries) or my family will think i hate my niece. I am frustrated af.\n\nSo AITA if i tell them i don\u2018t want to spend time with them?", "created_utc": 1693900266, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16ahtjy/aita_for_wanting_to_go_on_vacation_with_friends/", "score": 3647, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'll be enjoying a nice grown-up mini-vacation with my friends, but we'll definitely give you a wave if we see you by the pool.\"\n\nDo not stand for this.  Your brother and his wife have no right to demand your time.  If they don't want to look after their own child they can take a babysitter with them.\n\nNTA.  But stand up for yourself.", "You say you are \"the worst at setting boundaries.\" Well, now is the time to get better at it.\nAsk your friends to support you in this.\n\nSay \"no that's not going to work for me,\" then walk away. That's it. You don't have to answer any follow-up questions.\n\nPart of setting boundaries is knowing the person will be displeased with you, and that's OK. Let them be. You are doing nothing wrong.\n\nEnjoy your holiday!", "Here we go: \"Those plans don't work for me. I'm sorry, I'd love to spend time with (niece's name), but I've already made commitments with my time that I can not shift. I look forward to catching up with you when I get back.\"\n\nPractice and repeat.\n\nYou don't need to explain thar you're having dinner with your friends, going to a show or relaxing in the pool. \n\nNot to mention, it would be rude to your friends, who have booked this time away with you, to blow them off because of babysitting .\n\nAny reasonable family member knows that being unavailable to babysit doesn't mean you hate your neice.

My friends and I have already made plans together* *~~for that weekend that we cannot change~~*\\*, *so I have no free time to watch niece for you. Hope you have a great time!\"*\n\nRinse and repeat as often as necessary. By setting this boundary you are not saying that you \"hate\" your niece; you are simply shutting down any attempts by your brother to control your weekend plans. He has no right to do that to you.\n\nThink of it another way, by caving in to your brother's demands, you will be negatively affecting a trip that your friends have been looking forward to. They're expecting a weekend of letting their hair down and chilling out with you. You cannot do either of those things while you're looking after a four year old, so don't let them down.\n\n\\*Edited following a point raised in a comment below.", "NTA your brother is a rude asshole, don't you dare do it", "NTA. That was a *really* shitty thing your brother did. Tell him that you're there on vacation, and you hope he has made suitable child care arrangement for your niece, because you will not be available to pitch in.\n\nHe will try to crowd you, anyway, and this will likely involve dumping niece on you. Make sure that he knows that this will result in you contacting the police and reporting an abandoned child.\n\nIf you are able to change the date of your booking without paying a fee, do so, and do not tell your brother. His ambush childcare ploy deserves to fail.\n\nIf not, tell your brother that you have had to cancel the vacation, but wish him a good time, anyway. He may be surprised to see you when he gets there, but in the meantime he may have made alternate childcare arrangements that do not involve you. Make sure he knows that you're not available to take over.", "NTA.  Just tell your brother you have plans with your friends and unfortunately  aren't available to watch your niece.  Suggest that he can ask the hotel if they can recommend a professional childminding service.  You are a 29yr old adult, stand up for yourself and tell him no.  Make sure your SIL knows too, because he more than likely hasn't told her the truth, she is probably under the assumption you agreed to watch your niece.", "NTA, you had a trip planned that you bought for yourself and planned out. Why should you sacrifice your time and money just to not anger your entitled sibling?-\n\nYou didn't offer babysitting services, so it's incredibly rude of them to just assume you'd provide them.\n\nDraw a boundary here or they will continuously view you as someone to take advantage of.", "NTA  Tell him, \"You probably won't want me to be around your daughter since I will either be drunk, on my way to being drunk, or recuperating from being drunk.

But you bought this trip! \n\nI\u2019m suspicious of the timing that bro and SIL heard you were in this hotel weeks ago, and suddenly they are staying there the same weekend! It sounds like they did this intentionally, to guilt you into babysitting, on a weekend they knew you were excited about. \n\nAs a recovering bad at boundaries person, let me say. It feels anxious as hell when you start using them. But it feels so good at the same time. \n\nSomething along the lines of \u201cI love my niece and the two of you. Any other time I am more than happy to babysit her so that you two can relax. However, this is a trip that I have booked with my friends, to relax and have fun and that\u2019s what I plan to do.

Get your friends to help you stick to it while you are there. \n\nYour family will probably try to guilt trip you but all the things they say are their issues that they are using to try and get you to do what they want. You are a self and you matter. Your boundaries matter.", "NTA. They did this on purpose to try to take advantage of you.

That's so weird that I told you about where I was staying and you went and book the *exact same place* at the *exact same time*. Almost like you *planned* to make me give up my holiday with my friends to take care of your kid. But I know you know that your decision to go on holiday makes no difference to my plans. And that I won't be taking time out of *my* vacation just because you \"coincidentally\" will be in the same hotel. Because there's no way you planned to take advantage of *my trip* to try and get a free babysitter, would you?

Ps: sleeping in all day is also a plan. \n\nTell the hotel they can\u2019t give your room number to anyone even your brother. don\u2019t ever share your vacation plans with your brother ever again.\n \n\nCall your parent and share the story first: how are you haven\u2019t had holidays in months, you booked a holiday in a pricy hotel to relax and your bother without asking you to, decided to you\u2019d babysit - how entitled is it? Especially as they\u2019re not paying you to babysit and the hotel is expensive and you\u2019re always happy to help at home (if that\u2019s the case) when it\u2019s pre-planned. \n\nAlternatively tell your brother you\u2019re not a babysitter, your vacation time is your vacation time and if they\u2019re so exhausted you\u2019re happy to babysit 1 evening at home pre-planned. Give them a couple of dates far away when it works for you. Or if you want to be nice tell them  you\u2019re happy to reserve one evening on the trip, to catch up with them (and niece). Make it late on the trip so they don\u2019t rope you in doing more.", "NTA - \n\nYou are there on a \"guy trip\" to relax, not take care of a kindergartner. Your brother is out of line.\n\nTell him that you and your friends are fully booked with bachelor activities and none of them would be appropriate to take a 4- year old girl to.", "Nta. \n\n\"Oh nice, I think you guys will have a lovely time at the hotel. Unfortunately I won't be able to babysit as my friends and I have made some plans that are non refundable, you enjoy your holiday though. \n\nAnd then do everyone else has said, don't let them know your hotel room, and avoid them like the plague", "NTA.

And it was pretty presumptuous for you to think I would take time out of the vacation I have planned with a group of friends to babysit for you. That does not work for me. I\u2019ve had these plans for a while and shared them with you because I was sharing my excitement with you, not so you could derail them. I truly hope you guys have fun a fun vacation of your own, but I will be unreachable while I\u2019m there as I have plans the entirety of the weekend as I already told you.

Something tells me your brother did this on purpose,  infringe on your vacation to get a free babysitter while looking like the excellent husband and father. That was a major jerk move. You have to set firm boundaries. Send a mass group text, this is my first vacation,  I need to relax, I have made plans that are not 4 your old friendly.

Oh and don\u2019t just say you cannot change plans, but also that you WIL NOT change them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd do not offer to take your niece for even one minute.

Quite disrespectful and intrusive - to demand from you - that YOU should take care of your niece on your free weekends with friends. Give us an update pls", "NTA\nBut seriously,  just say you won't be available to help. This is the time to set boundaries,  they are using you because they know you won't say no.

In fact, if you don't tell them now what your boundaries are, you will be the AH - to yourself.\n\nYou are not being nice to anyone by not setting boundaries.  People need to know where they stand.  A person with no boundaries is a disaster waiting to happen.  Everyone actually does have boundaries and they will enforce them if someone goes too far.  Let your friends and family know what your boundaries are to save everyone from the grief of finding out what happens when someone goes too far.\n\nSimply tell your brother what you told us:  \"...i and three of my friends booked us a weekend trip (Friday - Sunday) a few weeks ago. It\u2018s my first time off since the beginning of may, to say i am thrilled is an understatement. We plan to party at night and chill at the pool by day.\"\n\nTell your brother you will not be able to watch your niece because you will probably be drunk, hung-over, or badly sun-burned.  This is your much anticipated vacation and that means \"no work\" including baby sitting.", "NTA.\n\nHenceforth don't share your vacation plans with them. It's a lesson. \n\nTalk to your friends and start way early. Early morning, they'll be asleep. So you won't get caught. Hold onto ur room key and keep ur mobile on mute. That way even if they call, they can't reach u. Party away all night, reach past 3 am. Give instructions to hotel guys you're not to be disturbed (especially be open about them that they're prone to disturb). Sleep away. In case they try to bang on ur door etc, just don't open. The hotel staff will escort them back.\n\nOnce they're in their room, use the gap and go out again. Stay out entire morning to midnight. Repeat the same for all 3 days.\n\nLast day, show ur face only when you're heading out of the place. When they confront, be cool and tell \" Well I did come here for my vacation. I did tell u that I'm going partying with my friends. I never agreed to be your babysitter. As much as I love niece, I don't think drunk me would be of any use to u.\" Walkaway!", "NTA, talk to the hotel and make sure that they know to NOT give your room details to anyone who asks for them.

Tell him in no uncertain terms that you told him you were going on vacation to have fun and spend time with friends. This not a family vacation.

Do not get me wrong i love my  niece to pieces, but i really want to enjoy this Weekend and not have any responsibility for anyone besides myself. I want to relax, be drunk and have fun with my friends. They are staying in the same hotel so i can\u2018t avoid them even if i wanted to.\n\nThe vacation is not refundable. I am either stuck with babysitting(her parents are really pushy and i am the worst at setting boundaries) or my family will think i hate my niece.

My advice would be to write out a response, using some of the good language people have offered in this thread. You can take your time planning it out and imagine that you won\u2019t send it anyways so you don\u2019t end up being people pleasing. Then you can have something you feel good about saying and prep yourself to say it.

Doesn't matter. They are shitty people for doing this, it sounds like they know you struggle setting boundaries and sound like the family doormat.

If they don't like it, tough. I know you say they're pushy, but you need to grow a pair and stand up for yourself. If you can do that, then you're nta. If you don't do that, then your family will always know you're a pushover and will always take advantage of you. Also, how will you explain to your mates?

You can\u2019t reason with unreasonable people.", "Nah, if the brother is going to hijack OP's vacations because he's a dick, OP can teach him a lesson by telling him the wrong hotel if he asks again. They're not going to learn unless they get a consequence like that.", "agreed, or just\u2026. set a boundary and say \u201csorry, I didn\u2019t book this holiday so I could babysit my niece\u201d? nothing wrong with being honest, if bro wants to react badly then that\u2019s on him.", "I condone using white lies in situations like this. I absolutely think it would be appropriate, if needed.\n\nLike say, the brother catches wind of a future vacation and asks OP what hotel they are stayed at, and then they decide to do this sheisty shit to OP again... back to square one.\n\nI'm condoning going that route because OP said they are not good at setting boundaries and their family sounds really controlling and overbearing.", "Isn't that just lying by omission? Keep your plans to yourself, but if bro finds out a little white lie can save you a lot of pain (at least in the moment). He'll probably be pissed after the fact though.", "That\u2019s actually the subtle boundary: if you press on, I will tell you anything\u2019s but my plan.\n\nAfter the third time, the person might not even bother pestering you since they cannot reliably make plans.", "Hey now!", "Lying is a very important social skill.", "Or someone asking of their newborn is cute", "Depends on how much I like the bride.", "For example, lying to someone to protect someone could be a good thing (for example protecting a friend from an abusive spouse/ex).", "I'm friends like that. Happy to help!", "that's not how /s works", "You need : * happy voice * as well to make this anywhere close to being sarcastic. You could have started with the great idea to shift the tone better.", "NP. Got it on the second word combo.", "That's a very good phrase for describing the difference between extroverts and introverts in regards to their needs for recharging.", "Vvacationing with children is not really vacationing. But pawning them off on someone else is insanely short-sighted. Watching your own kids is draining, but watching someone else's is worse.\n\nThe only time we've asked people to watch our kids on holiday was when we went with SIL and her family. We have kids in the same age range, so we'd sometimes watch theirs so they could go out with just the two of them and they did the same for us. That works. And sure, if we're taking a family holiday and my brother asks if he can take them to the pool then I'll be out the door before he finishes talking, but then he offered. I didn't ask.", "They crow constantly about their \"little blessings\", but then yeet the kids at the first halfway competent adult they see, and go running the other way \ud83d\ude06\n\nMy favorite thing is that they think that other people don't notice them pulling this BS, and then they still try to convince you how kids are just the best! Lmao right Sharon, because you made it look like SUCH a good time, while you're prowling for every opportunity to drop the little gremlin in someone else's lap.", "Give me your children, I'll gladly hand them over to the police and report you to CPS for child abandonment.. \n\nMaybe phrasing it that way would wake some people up.", "That\u2019s the thing, I hate to give the parents here anything, but I (as OP) wouldn\u2019t be doing this for the parents, I\u2019d be looking at as lunch with niece (or whatever), at which time i can let niece know that she\u2019s important to me, and explain that i hadn\u2019t planned to see her at hotel, and that i wish I  had more time, but this was supposed to be my time with friends, and we\u2019ve spent money in our vacation plans (and leave out part that her parents are assholes, if she\u2019s old enough, she\u2019ll get it though, and the niece would understand that it\u2019s not her fault in these situations), and if it comes up again, she\u2019ll more readily understand what her parents are doing to OP", "That was not his responsibility, his family is so selfish and annoying", "You are 29 an adult. You do not have to tell a soul where or what you are doing. How convient, when you told your brother where you were staying  he just happens to be staying at the same place. His kid his problem!!", "People will use any excuse to lie it seems...\n\nJust tell them no. Just change the subject, and if they can't stop then don't talk to them until you are done the thing you want to do. People act as though there is NO other option, that they just have to give in. You set the boundaries for yourself, not your family. They can 'coax, wheedle, guilt' and whatever else all they want but you don't have to tell them anything.", "It\u2019s actually really easy\u2026. \u201cSuch and such timeframe, I am OUT!\u201d And leave it at that.", "The point people are trying to make is that you can't always be reasonable with unreasonable people.\n\nIf someone's reaction to telling them where you will be staying is to plan for you to babysit, I don't think a small lie next time is a problem. It's not ideal, but none of this is ideal. Sometimes the most important thing is to stop people from trying to harm you/ruin things for you. \n\nI agree that standing up for oneself and refusing to tell plans would be the best. That's really hard sometimes.", "You must be busy these days.", "So is saying no.", "Lies", "Yes, I would have no hesitation in telling OP\u2019s family \u201cHe\u2019s not watching your baby, he already made plans with us. Don\u2019t be so selfish. If I see you try and dump YOUR baby on him and steal our holiday, I\u2019m taking it straight to the front desk as a lost child. Don\u2019t think I won\u2019t.\u201d \n\nThe key is to have a friend who is happy to be the bad guy!", "I have literally thrown out a friend of mine (single mother) out of her own house at one point to go have some fun with a girlfriend of hers because we were visting, yes I like your child, he likes me, we will get by without you for a few hours. Go have fun. \n\nBut that is about the only child I would be willing to do that for - he's old enough that we can play mario kart together :D", "Vacationing with young kids is still fun and is still vacationing.  We did it all the time when my sons were little.", "Hey, drinking cocktails in the middle of the day is hard work!", "And you offered (which, as a parent, I would've appreciated tremendously, so good for you!). If OP had offered to take niece of their hands for the weekend, then they wouldn't have been assholes for saying yes.", "Lucky you. I thought it was exhausting. Our youngest was a bit of an adventurer, which meant we spent our days chasing him around. And our eldest is a social animal who would just randomly enter other people's accomodation without telling us. Not great.", "Same. I love the shi out of my kids. When they were young I took them everywhere.  They are adults now and we are really close.", "And you defo don't want any kids around making it harder.", "Maybe because you're lacking in life experience and empathy. It's cool, I was the same way, mouthy and unapologetic, but other people have different strengths and weaknesses. I bet you have plenty of hangups none of us have or understand either.\n\nI'll give an example. My mother is very loving and very overbearing. She worries a lot. My job requires me to go to not so safe places and deal with not so safe people (think environmental law enforcement). I don't usually tell my mother where I'm going, only where I've just been, or else I'll have to listen to half an hour of warnings and woes and I just can't sometimes. It's no use telling her not to worry, she will anyway, and I can't tell her to shut up about it because that would hurt her feelings, and I love the old girl.\n\nSo I lie. I omit and I lie if I have to. She keeps calm, I get more rest and all's good.\n\nLying really is ok if it saves you some misery and is not harming anyone.", "I get verbally emotionally and mentally abused if I don\u2019t give in and tell them where I am and who I\u2019m with.  \n\nI guess I just need to grow a spine \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Spoken like someone who's never had the joys of dealing with an abusive family.\n\nSure, in a perfect world people just \"grow spines\", but back here in reality it's not that simple for a lot of people, for a lot of reasons.", "What's your point?\n\nJust because OP's family might be abusive doesn't mean that he should become a liar...", "Us too. So many people would say: \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re going to X with your kids. You\u2019re so brave.\u201d Not at all. It was fun. One is still in high school, one is an adult, but they both still like to hang out with us."]}
