I politely declined and thought it was over. Until they started complaining how their on vacation they should be able to enjoy it, how I\u2019m not doing nothing anyways, how I\u2019ve been watching them & how can I watch my nephew and not my cousins.

I must not have closed the app before putting it in my pocket.", "Do you have a link to the post?", "You can ask for a nice, non-alcoholic drink in the bar. Every barman can mix them. It'll look just like \"original\" drink, minus the alcohol part.", "A mocktail if you will. I\u2019ve had one of those too. All the fruity goodness and none of the alcohol.", "Nta. 1 almost teenager is completely  different to watch 4 toddlers.", "I vibe with dad and bro :)", "NTA. THIS VILLAGE THAT YOUR MOTHER SPEAKS OF, WERE THEY PRESENT DURING THE MAKING OF SAID CHILDREN? I THINK NOT!!! THE NERVE OF THEM TRYING TO RAILRAOD YOU AND MAKE YOU FEEL GUILTY FOR NOT BABYSITTING. SOME PEOPLE MAN", "NTA. Your dad and brother are 100% right - choosing not to drink does not mean you volunteer as babysitter for the entire group. Also, a familiar 11 year old is a VERY different critter to be in charge of than 4 toddlers.", "NTA\n\nIt does indeed take a village to raise a child. The holiday village you were staying at realised this, and helpfully provided a nanny service in recognition of this fact.", "nta and good for you standing your ground", "NTA. Your Dad and Brother are right. And you are right, too. You didn't give birth to the kids, so not your responsibility.", "NTA. Your aunts and mother are assholes.", "They could just take turn. Lots of people do that when more parents with small kids are on vacation together.", "That's what I thought. It takes a village to raise one child, not the whole village dump their kids on one person smh...\nEditted because autocorrect", "This X 10000\n\nYou KNOW that whenever people mention that village, they only mean it should help them. They will conveniently never be able to reciprocate.", "Exactly. There are times when you NEED to be rude to certain people because they ride roughshod over any attempt to say no politely. The fact that they then become horribly offended at your rudeness is completely irrelevant - they brought that rudeness on themselves. Besides, if they\u2019d listened to the initial refusal, then everything could have stayed civil and polite.", "Exactly they never talk about it when it is not convenient. Also only convenient for babysitting do not dare to tell their child no or that they are wrong. And them giving something back? Never", "I got u boo.\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/w3x15u/aita_for_intentionally_drinking_at_family_events/\n\nActually they were probably referring to this one\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/143zzbs/aita_for_getting_high_so_my_relatives_dont_try/", "It was the second one!
