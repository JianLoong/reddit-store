At this resort I\u2019m able to drink but I just don\u2019t feel comfortable to especially around my parents. While we\u2019ve been here I kept an eye on the kids, if I\u2019m at the pool and the adults want to go to the swim up bar I\u2019ll let them nobody asked me to I just did it. So later that night we go to dinner and my brother ask me to watch my nephew and I agreed. My aunts both asked me minutes later to watch my little cousins for the night and let them sleep over. I politely declined and thought it was over. Until they started complaining how their on vacation they should be able to enjoy it, how I\u2019m not doing nothing anyways, how I\u2019ve been watching them & how can I watch my nephew and not my cousins. I snapped and told them these aren\u2019t my kids & I\u2019m on vacation just as much as they are. Going to watching one kid to watching five is ridiculous.\n\n\nMy nephew practically lives with us back at home so it\u2019s normal for him to be around & he\u2019s older too all he needs is his game and he\u2019s good. Their kids aren\u2019t bad but it\u2019s normal toddlers act they throw tantrums and ask a million questions which I don\u2019t have time for my patience is thin. I reminded my aunts of the nanny services the resorts provides and said they would feel safer if the kids were in family care. I told them no again and went about my day. When it was time for them to go to the club my nephew came in my room and my aunts were at my door dressed with their kids and a few toys I told them I wasn\u2019t watching them and closed the door in their face. I hate feeling like I\u2019m being walked over so I admit it was rude but I felt disrespected especially after I just told them no.  \n\nThey ended up taking them to the nanny, once morning hit my mom said it was rude how I shut the door in their face and I should\u2019ve just watched them, it takes a village to raise a child & how my aunts never get a break. \n\nMy dad and brother said just because I\u2019m the only one not drinking doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m automatically the babysitter.", "created_utc": 1689274468, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14yt4hu/aita_for_not_babysitting_on_vacation/", "score": 345, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Well done", "NTA - I would have argued with your mom that it was in fact your aunts that were rude and extremely entitled by still showing up at your door like you are watching their kids after you had already told them no. You are on vacation as well and don't have kids, so why would you spend you vacation looking after kids that aren't yours. They had them, they need to take care of them.

Your Aunts need to find their own \"village.\"", "NTA  fine, next time it happens march all 5 over to your mom, tell her \" it takes a village\" and leave.
