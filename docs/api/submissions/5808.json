{"id": 5808, "submission_id": "zwx80i", "title": "AITA for asking to meet my boss in public?", "selftext": "I (29M) recently started a new job and report to \"Alice\" (30sF). I come from a conservative Christian background and while I don't have any issues with reporting to a female, I'd prefer not to be alone with anyone of the opposite gender. I am married and out of respect for my wife, she is the only adult woman I spend time alone with (outside of family, of course). Furthermore, I wouldn't want there to be any appearance of impropriety on the lady's behalf, especially at work. In Alice's case, she is unmarried and very friendly and I worry that someone might see her meeting with a man alone and assume she's being flirtatious.\n\nThis issue has arisen recently because it's time for end of year performance reviews. Previously, I've managed to get Alice to hold our 1:1s in the work cafeteria so that there are others around. However, Alice is insisting that my performance review be conducted in her office with just the two of us. I told her that I was uncomfortable with this. She pressed a little to see if she had done something to make me uncomfortable, and I replied that she hadn't, but out of respect for my wife, I would not be alone in a room with her. She did not take this well and told me it was not negotiable. I told her that I would be willing to meet in her office if I could have a male HR rep sit in with me, and she told me that she would have to think about it. Today, I received this email:\n\n\"Hi \\[name\\],\n\nI'm following up on the discussion we had on Monday about your unwillingness to meet alone with me (or any female colleague). I want you to feel comfortable and respected at work, but I would like to make it clear that there are occasions where it will be necessary for us to speak privately. It is an expectation of this job that you will be able to meet with me, or any other female colleague, alone if the situation calls for it. All employees are expected to conduct themselves professionally, and I have some concerns about your assumption that a private meeting between a man and woman in the workplace would be inherently inappropriate or unprofessional. I hope that you have taken the opportunity to reflect on this since our conversation and will be willing revisit your position. I have set up a meeting tomorrow so that we can discuss this further. \\[HR rep\\] will be in attendance.\n\n\\-Alice\"\n\nI don't think I'm out of line here and I believe that my religion should be respected in the workplace, but Alice's email has me worried.

The only reason you\u2019re not meeting with this woman in a convenient location is because of her gender? That\u2019s sexist. Her being a woman does not equate to a) her being attracted to men, b) her being attracted to you, c) her inability to control her impulses if both a and b are true, or d) anyone assuming any of those things. If your wife does assume those things, she has trust issues. If YOU can\u2019t control yourself, you have even larger issues. Women work, and you will have to work with them.

Either you believe: women are sexual temptresses (objectifying and othering belief, btw) and that they are responsible for keeping you virtuous by not being around you without a chaperone\nOr: Men are not responsible for their actions when finding another person attractive\nThese are both troubling and unhealthy.

(Certain Jewish religions come to mind, as an example.)  If given a choice men won't shake hands with a woman, but if a woman offers her hand for a handshake, it would be unprofessional to decline and it is therefore allowed.

Do women only exist in a sexual capacity to you? Because that is what you are suggesting. She is clearly a smart woman who is good at what she does, hence her being YOUR BOSS. You need to grow up and learn how to treat women as equal human beings who are plenty capable of having strictly professional relationships with the opposite gender.\n\nGod this is insane.", "I think you need to prepare to be fired.

Obviously she is a professional and your superior so you have no reason to fear she would behave improperly, and as meeting with your direct superior is a standard practice in business, you know no one would truly worry about anything untoward happening or anyone\u2019s reputations being compromised, so the only conclusion one can draw from your demand is that you cannot trust yourself to not assault your boss because she is a woman.", "YTA.

I'm sure your boss feels thoroughly creeped out that you're conflating a simple meeting with something that could possibly be disrespectful to your spouse (as in something that has any possibility of sex).

The concept that men/women cannot be alone together is an incredibly outdated one. This is 2023 (almost), not 1980. There is mutual trust between my fianc\u00e9e and I, and we are comfortable with eachother being alone around someone of the opposite sex. Who cares about how it\u2019s viewed? My immediate reaction when I see a man and woman together isn\u2019t that they\u2019re dating or \u201cinvolved\u201d unless they exhibit the typical couple behaviors. My male boss has taken me out to lunches individually before, and my coworkers too, but he\u2019s happily married and many of us are in happy relationships. You need to be able to separate male-female relationships (and I mean friendships too) from \u201cthey must be dating\u201d. Two people with different genitalia sitting together and talking does not equal a couple.
