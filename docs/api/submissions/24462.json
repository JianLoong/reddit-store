Shane blatantly used you for help with the wedding when you were 16, then reneged on his clearly stated intention to have you attend. That\u2019s not a mistake - that\u2019s deliberate A H territory. You may have overreacted a little, but you were a hurt teenager, which I think gives you a little leeway. It\u2019s entirely up to you whether you want to risk Shane in your life again, and if you\u2019re not comfortable with his  demands for an apology, then your decision to stand firm is perfectly valid.", "NTA. He resorted to death threats because you refused to babysit. Nope nope nope. He used you plain and simple and then got mad when you refused to be used any more. \n\nI dont think you have anything to apologise for. He was the adult at that particular time and he made his choices and basically fucked over a 16 year old. \n\nAnd now only wants to reconnect because hes been thrown out and  attempting to manipulate you by using his kids as weapons. Still a user. You dont need that. Im prettt sure if you let him in your home you would never get him out nor would he do ANYTHING to maintain your home and i can only imagine the boundary stomping. \n\nKeep your peace OP and dont let this guy anywhere near you", "NTA. Shane was a user then,  he still is a user now. Keep your distance from this mess,  and keep your peace.", "NTA. He used you for budget/planning etc 10 years ago. And I suspect is planning on using you again for housing. I\u2019d be for staying well clear of the current disaster!", "NTA if you have to apology to him and might have him stay in your house for free (because family must help each other). Just let the relationship between you stay death and don't go in his mess.", "NTA\nThe only thing that might, and I emphasize MIGHT, be worth an apology are the words you used but not meaning.\nUsing you to organise the wedding but making you just the babysitter after promising you to attend the wedding normally is a huge dick move.", "Good question! I would probably call the kid's mother and tell Shane to bugger off. I feel bad for the kids because I know how Shane can be and I feel for SIL because, while she may have influenced his behaviour ten years ago, I have heard that she did not have an easy marriage.", "He used you for his wedding preparation\n\n\nNow he wants to use you for accomodation\n\nNTA\n\n\nAnd stay far from him\n\n\nWhere was he for the last 10 years????", "NTA. Sounds like he\u2019s always been a less than stellar person, even to his STBXW. You were clearly right in your description, he isn\u2019t even man enough to sort out his own life and wants you to do it for him again. IMO, unless your life is being negatively impacted by his absence (I suspect not), then you\u2019re much better off without him.", "NTA. I agree with the poster who said he was a user then, and still is one today. He used you to organize his wedding, was going to flip the script and use you as a babysitter, and now he wants to use you for free housing. He would never have tried to reconnect if he didn\u2019t want to use you/take from you.", "You are NTA.  If I were you I would not change anything.  Stay the course.  His is going to ask to stay with you.", "You don't know him after 10 years, he had a marriage and children amd you've not been there. He used you and now conveniently as his life falls apart he wants to play big bro again? He's a user, doesn't acknowledge he wronged you by demanding you apologise. People can change but my bet is nope! Its entirely an emotive decision for you but from the outside looking in it easy to say he'll no. You are NTA , you owe this guy nothing but can understand if you were willing to risk it for family.", "10 years nc? He wants something. Death threats? He should stay nc. That is a step too far.", "NTA. He wants to reconnect? Remind him of the death threats he sent *when you refused to babysit*. His move, his apology comes first.  And if you do reconcile then make sure it\u2019s on your terms, do not let him stay in your house until trust and respect have clearly been established, and even then only if you actually want to. His need is not your responsibility.", "Nta. You have nothing to gain from reconciling with this man", " NTA, and I think your suspicions about your brother are true about him wanting to live in your house. He wants to \u201cpatching things up\u201d so he brooch the topic of staying with you. You know what kind person he is, and he will definitely use his child as a bartering chip. It\u2019s un fair to them and it\u2019s especially unfair to you. And if anyone else says to you \u201cbut you\u2019ve got all this extra space..\u201d ask them why their not offering the same instead of putting it in you.", "NTA \n\nHe caused this by not being upfront and trying to use you for money and babysitting. Fact he wants you to apologize at all, proves he still thinks he was right. Fuck him and if your parents push, tell them to fuck off too.", "NTA.\nOnce again Shane needs something you can provide. Once he moves in , you will be the caretaker of his kids when he has them.  It is your choice if you want to take a chance or not.", "Nta and also it sounds like you don\u2019t have kids.  Remind everyone you have a chid free house\u2026.", "NTA. You owe him nothing. Especially after the death threats.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShane ist the Ah, and you handled that AH well. Magnificient how you stood up to him.  Well done.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDon't apologize - Why would you. You already know dsshane is an AH. And he does not weant a relationship anyway, he only wants your house.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\" for not apologising for what I did and said over ten years ago?\" .. **YOU have nothing to apologize for, you did the right thing then.**", "NTA. You might have been 16 at the time, but that's irrelevant (in so much as it's relevant that he could use it as a stupid arbitrary rule to keep you out of his wedding) but you were not too young to to provide assistance. \n\nYou did not act like a brat, so much as a wronged person. I mean, if an adult had provided help with a wedding and been led to believe they were invited. only to have their invitation yanked at final stages (when coincidentally all their labour had been utilised through the planning stages) and informed they would be babysitting - I can't imagine an adult of any age would be happy. It was a prick move, mate. \n\nHe than attempted to emotionally manipulate you by using bloody death threats to get you to babysit. Really?? DEATH THREATS! And you are the one being told you were the brat. Huh. \n\nAlso, I don't blame you for not wanting to look at pics of the wedding. For you it was a horrible, relationship destroying event in yours and your brothers lives, so I totally get it. \n\nYou did nothing wrong to apologise for. Your bro just wants to use your house to live in. I mean, he didn't bother to apologise until he needed a house. Don't let people spin it as your fault, just because you stuck to your guns after being treated as an unwanted and disposable employee rather than a blood relation. Also, it's Karma. Bet your bro wishes he'd not treated you so shite now he needs you. Fancy that. And he still hasn't learned from it, because he wants you to apologise for being righteously upset by his abysmal treatment of you. \n\nNah lad, you have self respect. Keep the line.", "NTA. Who the fuck doesnt want to have their own brother at a wedding. Like I just cant wrap my head around that.", "One of my aunt's family gives being right too much importance. They fight constantly and don't talk to each other even for years for trivial matters. They justify this as \"because I was right.\" I don't say you were AH or not when you were 16, but the outcome is you don't have brother and nephews, your brother doesn't have you. You had the excuse that you were young and not mature enough, but after 10 years what have you gained and lost? Is it worth? Consider someone robbing you with a gun. What would you do, fight and die, because the rubber is TAH and you are not? Or give him the money with all those negative feelings that would hunt you for years? \nI recommend both of you to grow up a little. And don't allow him to stay with you until both of you are really mature adults. One of you could be a murderer and tell the inmates that \"but, I was right.\"", "INFO: Why was Shane borrowing money and getting wedding planning help from a 16 yr old child?", "#10/10", "I don't know what he's been up to. My parents have been told a heavily redacted story. I would like to contact my SIL and ask her what exactly happened during those years. But I don't know what she has been told about me. At worst, she hates me; at best, I am a stranger.", "I did eventually apologise to my parents for what I said to them and how I treated them (they were caught in the crossfire). They also apologised for trying to pay me off, they weren't happy with it either but wanted to keep the peace. They do constantly try to mend things between Shane and I but we both share a vindictive streak", "How much you want to bet it's a free roof over his head, provided by the same person that helped with his wedding then got excluded?", "I think your instinct to stay out of it is a good one; contacting your SIL after all these years just to ask probing questions about her disintegrating marriage would not improve the situation.", "You aren\u2019t vindictive, someone treating you badly and not apologising for it is just having boundaries and learning from your experience. If he\u2019s in touch now cos he wants something can see how that will go, persuades you to rent your house, then decides to not pay rent and makes you the bad person for wanting to evict etc. also using relationships with family members as a bargaining chip is sick. I would say you\u2019d love to be an uncle to your nieces and nephews but that\u2019s independent of your and his relationship", "This wasn't the time to \"keep the peace\".  They had an opportunity to set Shane straight and choose not to, at your expense.\n\nShane wanting an apology is his way of being in control.  Remember, you were just a \"child\" and he should be more forgiving."]}
