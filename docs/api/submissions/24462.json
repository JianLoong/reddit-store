I've decided to leave this situation well enough alone for now.

Shane blatantly used you for help with the wedding when you were 16, then reneged on his clearly stated intention to have you attend. That\u2019s not a mistake - that\u2019s deliberate A H territory. You may have overreacted a little, but you were a hurt teenager, which I think gives you a little leeway. It\u2019s entirely up to you whether you want to risk Shane in your life again, and if you\u2019re not comfortable with his  demands for an apology, then your decision to stand firm is perfectly valid.", "NTA. He resorted to death threats because you refused to babysit. Nope nope nope. He used you plain and simple and then got mad when you refused to be used any more. \n\nI dont think you have anything to apologise for. He was the adult at that particular time and he made his choices and basically fucked over a 16 year old. \n\nAnd now only wants to reconnect because hes been thrown out and  attempting to manipulate you by using his kids as weapons. Still a user. You dont need that. Im prettt sure if you let him in your home you would never get him out nor would he do ANYTHING to maintain your home and i can only imagine the boundary stomping. \n\nKeep your peace OP and dont let this guy anywhere near you", "NTA. Shane was a user then,  he still is a user now. Keep your distance from this mess,  and keep your peace.", "NTA. He used you for budget/planning etc 10 years ago.

IMO, unless your life is being negatively impacted by his absence (I suspect not), then you\u2019re much better off without him.", "NTA. I agree with the poster who said he was a user then, and still is one today. He used you to organize his wedding, was going to flip the script and use you as a babysitter, and now he wants to use you for free housing.

People can change but my bet is nope! Its entirely an emotive decision for you but from the outside looking in it easy to say he'll no.

I mean, if an adult had provided help with a wedding and been led to believe they were invited. only to have their invitation yanked at final stages (when coincidentally all their labour had been utilised through the planning stages) and informed they would be babysitting - I can't imagine an adult of any age would be happy. It was a prick move, mate. \n\nHe than attempted to emotionally manipulate you by using bloody death threats to get you to babysit. Really?? DEATH THREATS! And you are the one being told you were the brat. Huh. \n\nAlso, I don't blame you for not wanting to look at pics of the wedding. For you it was a horrible, relationship destroying event in yours and your brothers lives, so I totally get it. \n\nYou did nothing wrong to apologise for. Your bro just wants to use your house to live in. I mean, he didn't bother to apologise until he needed a house. Don't let people spin it as your fault, just because you stuck to your guns after being treated as an unwanted and disposable employee rather than a blood relation. Also, it's Karma. Bet your bro wishes he'd not treated you so shite now he needs you. Fancy that.

You had the excuse that you were young and not mature enough, but after 10 years what have you gained and lost? Is it worth? Consider someone robbing you with a gun.

It does not sound like your brother wants to reconnect with you, he wants help and out of a caravan. Obviously, this is up to you but I suggest you take a step back, take a breath and think about what you want. Do you trust your brothers intentions? Do you want a relationship?

The worst thing that will happen is you'll have the confirmation that he's a TAH and you'll cut him off for good.\nSorry for the long reply, this is too close to my heart.\nOne last thing, if you want to have a relationship with your brother's kids don't let your relationship with your brother stop you, it's not their fault, you can always reach your STBXSIL, or even if they spend time with your parents.", "Yeah, NTA. The entire point of inviting people to your wedding is to gather support for your marriage. By not inviting his brother, Shane made it very clear that he doesn't want his support.", " He wants a free bedroom, and the kicker, he wants a free babysitter so he can go out and meet a new lady. Tell Shane to pound grass.", "I also want to add how strange it is to have a child free wedding\u2026and count the 16 year old who is literally helping you plan it as a child. These people are not rational", "He doesn\u2019t want to reconnect, he wants free housing. What an ass", "I think you read a different story. His older brother was abusive. Death threats for a decision that was based on a retracted invitation? That's not about being right, that's about protecting oneself.", "[removed]", "[removed]", "Bot stole this comment from u/disastrous_grape54", "Thank you for some excellent advice. To be honest, prior to the wedding thing, Shane and I were very close. We were like opposites. Yes, he frequently managed to mess up every good thing that happened to him but it was like a running joke. He was a good laugh and really fun but had a real mean streak that I didn't get first hand experience of until the wedding.\n\nI should speak to Shane but before I do so, I want to speak to STBXSIL. I would like her permission to see my niece and nephew because I don't want to do anything behind her back, especially if it turns out she wants no more to do with our family.\n\nTo be clear, Shane won't be able to stay with me. Partly because I have a great fondness for my own privacy and also because I dislike him in particular.", "There was actually nothing to apologise for at all. This AH brother siphoned money off his teenage brother for his wedding then expected him to babysit. Now he\u2019s come slithering back, wanting to hole up in the OP\u2019s house. The best thing that could have happened to the op was going no contact.", "So they can house him", "Your parents were trying to keep Shane's peace, not yours. You were never invited to the wedding and they knew it, your parents were not caught in the crossfire, they were complicit in the scheme.\n\nThey're still trying to keep Shane's peace with their attempts to \"mend\" things between you. Given you think your \"vindictive streak\" is preventing you, I'm betting they're constantly telling you to apologise to him because you were wrong and that's why you're here doubting yourself. Shane thinks, and has thought this entire time, he's entitled to an apology for you being upset at finding out he used and betrayed you. Why haven't your parents disabused him of that notion in order to repair the peace? Why isn't he the one here asking about his refusal to apologise and if he would be an AH for apologising at this late stage in order to get free housing.", "That's another thing. When Shane asked for an apology, he said that the reason I was disinvited was because that's what SIL wanted. I'm sceptical because I'm just hearing about this now but I plan to converse with SIL and hopefully get one step closer to the truth.", "That was my reaction, too. \"Child free\" weddings are to keep things from being disrupted by the shenanigans of young children. I have NEVER heard of anyone applying this to teenagers.", "Nope. We don't know if he is abusive or not. All we know is he was AH for not inviting his brother and today he needs his brother's help. We also know they curse a lot.", "Agreed. My sister and I had a major falling out and did not speak for about 11 years. We didn\u2019t live near each other so it was easy. When I moved to the same town, I reached out because I truly missed her. She really fucked me over, but she is my only nuclear family member left. \n\nWe didn\u2019t have to spend too much time together before I realized how manipulative and conniving and evil she is, all under a thin veneer of holy Christian evangelism. Never going to take responsibility for what she did to me, never gonna apologize. The universe is not going to right itself and give me the closure I used to want so badly. \n\nI just accepted it as an unchangeable truth and moved on.", "Bot stole this from u/mysterious-bag-5283", "Shane isn't sorry at all, that is why he hasn't apologized, and he's only coming around at all b/c he's desperate for a place to crash.", "\"I'm gonna give you the honor of helping me and letting me stay with you, all it costs is for you to apologize!\" - OPs brother probably", "Perfectly summed up.", "Bot stole this from u/yourcatsbff", "The entitlement of some people!! I wouldn\u2019t want to meet his kids after all his BS! He can stay a ghost\u2026", "It's incredibly possible he wants to reconcile to have a roof over his head, but it makes me question how you would be the only option for that. Is he unemployed? Has he burned bridges with everyone else? Granted, nobody knows the full story, but if I was reconnecting with someone and their first ask would be to move in, that's a hard pass, especially if they want an apology first. \n\nIf you're curious,  meet in a public place. Tell them the apology is off the table unless he is willing to apologize as well, for something he had zero intentions of actually doing.. (You weren't ever going to be at the wedding or reception.  It was only ever a carrot to be dangled.) and working towards moving forward.  \n\nI'd probably do it just to find out the true intentions.", " That's not about being right, that's about protecting oneself.", "Haha, I wish. But they can't. They downsized into a posh little bungalow in Devon soon after I moved out. Not enough space and too far away", "It doesn't really matter if it was what SIL wanted. Your brother and parents went along with it and that makes them all culpable. \n\nIt was irrational to have you help plan the wedding and then not only disinvite you but want to exploit you for child care for other guests. They saw you a tool to be used, not an actual human being with thoughts and feelings of your own.\n\nThe fact that brother feels you should apologize and your parents want you to bend to repair the relationship tells me nothing has changed on that front. Don't let yourself get used twice.", "\u2026HE SENT DEATH THREATS. \n\nLike, are you actually reading the post?", "How is threatening to kill your brother *not* abusive?", "[removed]", "[removed]", "Thank you!", "Yes, I only have the suspicion that he wants to move in. From what I know, he has a job in sales and he's good at it. As long as he doesn't mess it up, then he will bounce back in no time.", " He wants to reconnect? Remind him of the death threats he sent when you refused to babysit. His move, his apology comes first..", "Bot stole this comment from u/terrible_bug407", "Bot stole this from u/heffreygee", "Yeah, he should be able to afford something if he's a good at sales. Even a cheap place is better than no place. This sounds like a ploy on his part, but it still boggles the mind that you would be the only option for him to move in with.", "Getting involved with his kids is what he wants because it will lead to you being manipulated by him. That babysitting you didn't do all those years ago with will be all both him and the soon to be ex want from you. Ask me how I know."]}
