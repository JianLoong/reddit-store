Shane blatantly used you for help with the wedding when you were 16, then reneged on his clearly stated intention to have you attend. That\u2019s not a mistake - that\u2019s deliberate A H territory. You may have overreacted a little, but you were a hurt teenager, which I think gives you a little leeway. It\u2019s entirely up to you whether you want to risk Shane in your life again, and if you\u2019re not comfortable with his  demands for an apology, then your decision to stand firm is perfectly valid.", "NTA. He resorted to death threats because you refused to babysit. Nope nope nope. He used you plain and simple and then got mad when you refused to be used any more. \n\nI dont think you have anything to apologise for. He was the adult at that particular time and he made his choices and basically fucked over a 16 year old. \n\nAnd now only wants to reconnect because hes been thrown out and  attempting to manipulate you by using his kids as weapons. Still a user. You dont need that. Im prettt sure if you let him in your home you would never get him out nor would he do ANYTHING to maintain your home and i can only imagine the boundary stomping. \n\nKeep your peace OP and dont let this guy anywhere near you", "NTA. Shane was a user then,  he still is a user now. Keep your distance from this mess,  and keep your peace.", "NTA. He used you for budget/planning etc 10 years ago.

IMO, unless your life is being negatively impacted by his absence (I suspect not), then you\u2019re much better off without him.", "NTA. I agree with the poster who said he was a user then, and still is one today. He used you to organize his wedding, was going to flip the script and use you as a babysitter, and now he wants to use you for free housing.

People can change but my bet is nope! Its entirely an emotive decision for you but from the outside looking in it easy to say he'll no.

I mean, if an adult had provided help with a wedding and been led to believe they were invited. only to have their invitation yanked at final stages (when coincidentally all their labour had been utilised through the planning stages) and informed they would be babysitting - I can't imagine an adult of any age would be happy. It was a prick move, mate. \n\nHe than attempted to emotionally manipulate you by using bloody death threats to get you to babysit. Really?? DEATH THREATS! And you are the one being told you were the brat. Huh. \n\nAlso, I don't blame you for not wanting to look at pics of the wedding. For you it was a horrible, relationship destroying event in yours and your brothers lives, so I totally get it. \n\nYou did nothing wrong to apologise for. Your bro just wants to use your house to live in. I mean, he didn't bother to apologise until he needed a house. Don't let people spin it as your fault, just because you stuck to your guns after being treated as an unwanted and disposable employee rather than a blood relation. Also, it's Karma. Bet your bro wishes he'd not treated you so shite now he needs you. Fancy that.

You had the excuse that you were young and not mature enough, but after 10 years what have you gained and lost? Is it worth? Consider someone robbing you with a gun.

It does not sound like your brother wants to reconnect with you, he wants help and out of a caravan. Obviously, this is up to you but I suggest you take a step back, take a breath and think about what you want. Do you trust your brothers intentions? Do you want a relationship?

That doesn't mean you are obligated to have a relationship with him. I wouldn't blame you if you don't. The last minute switch to babysitting sounds like he was trying to pull some sort of ham-handed trick on you. And you're probably right that he is only looking for a place to live now.", "Usually reddit disagrees with me, but I'm always shocked that people are happily willing to destroy family relationships so they can have that one perfect party day when they get married. They never intended to let you go, they were always serious about having a child free wedding, and they blatantly used you to take care of their adult business leading up to the wedding. And he's still not sorry and thinks YOU should be. His poor kids. You're NTA", "NTA. You were good enough to help plan your brothers wedding but couldn't attend because 16 was too young and furthermore they wanted you to babysit.\n\nYou don't owe him an apology and it seems that he only wants to use you again. Don't bother with him and don't consider letting these strangers move in with you", "NTA.\n\nYou have zero obligation to him.  Not only did he screw you over back then, he's only interested in \"reconnecting\" now so he can freeload off you again.  Your instinct to keep him no contact is the right one.  And be clear that there's no chance of him moving in with you, ever, not matter how much he apologizes if you somehow choose to keep talking to him (because he'll get more desperate as time goes on).\n\nGood luck!", "[removed]", "> You may have overreacted a little, but you were a hurt teenager, which I think gives you a little leeway.\n\nHe was mad that he was excluded from the wedding proper and voluntold as a free babysitter.  His brother *threatened to kill him* for not being a free babysitter.  \n\nOP's reaction was entirely appropriate.  His continued no/low contact is also entirely appropriate.  \n\nOP is NTA", "This should be highlighted in all kinds of colors", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

I'm not in contact with her", "thats not a very big improvement from a death threat", "From your post, it seems you are a responsible and kind guy who both your parents and brother were using \"for finances\" as you say. Then your brother used and abused you with the planning and invite, and your parents abused you by not standing up for you as any decent person would have. IF your FSIL didn't want you in the wedding, she was using and abusing you, too. And I think you've been either subtly or not-so-subtly guilt-tripped by your family over this incident for years.  \nGod, I'd stay as far as possible from the whole lot of them! I only see the likelihood of more use and abuse. You can talk to them, but keep your wits about you and keep your antenna up. Don't get massaged into being used again. Good luck!", "Yes not vindictive so much as setting necessary boundaries because he sounds toxic", "Also how the hell does this apply to immediate family? The idea of people\u2019s younger brothers and sisters (let alone their own children) not attending their wedding is completely bizarre.", "Good sales people can be very manipulative.  Keep your distance.  If you let him stay one night, you\u2019ll never get rid of him", "It looks like Shane wants to get the upper hand by apologizing to you and taking him to your house.", "Because once I got emotionally attached to my nieces and nephews, both my sisters manipulated the hell out of me for years. I hung in there even though it was horrible because I cared about their kids. Babysitting wasn't all they wanted from me but they constantly wanted to drop their kids off with me, to the point of interfering with my work schedule and caring for my own child.\n\nOP's brother, SIL and parents have already proven they see him a potential babysitter. Now that they are going to be single parents, the need for free child care is becoming exponentially more important. Brother asking for an apology in order to see his kids is nothing more than a litmus test to see if the OP is guidable enough to exploit some more. The brother thinks OP might be because in the brother's mind the OP has been isolated and out of contact with him and his family. So, now's the time to look back into that OP option again.\n\nThink of it this way, if someone walked up to you and handed a shiny new widget free of charge but the catch was that keeping it would mean they always got to manipulate you, would you accept the pretty trinket? The kids are the widget and the manipulation is pretty much guaranteed. OP should run."]}
