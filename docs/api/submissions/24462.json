Shane blatantly used you for help with the wedding when you were 16, then reneged on his clearly stated intention to have you attend. That\u2019s not a mistake - that\u2019s deliberate A H territory. You may have overreacted a little, but you were a hurt teenager, which I think gives you a little leeway. It\u2019s entirely up to you whether you want to risk Shane in your life again, and if you\u2019re not comfortable with his  demands for an apology, then your decision to stand firm is perfectly valid.", "NTA. He resorted to death threats because you refused to babysit. Nope nope nope. He used you plain and simple and then got mad when you refused to be used any more. \n\nI dont think you have anything to apologise for. He was the adult at that particular time and he made his choices and basically fucked over a 16 year old. \n\nAnd now only wants to reconnect because hes been thrown out and  attempting to manipulate you by using his kids as weapons. Still a user. You dont need that. Im prettt sure if you let him in your home you would never get him out nor would he do ANYTHING to maintain your home and i can only imagine the boundary stomping. \n\nKeep your peace OP and dont let this guy anywhere near you", "NTA. Shane was a user then,  he still is a user now. Keep your distance from this mess,  and keep your peace.", "NTA. He used you for budget/planning etc 10 years ago. And I suspect is planning on using you again for housing. I\u2019d be for staying well clear of the current disaster!", "NTA if you have to apology to him and might have him stay in your house for free (because family must help each other). Just let the relationship between you stay death and don't go in his mess.", "NTA\nThe only thing that might, and I emphasize MIGHT, be worth an apology are the words you used but not meaning.\nUsing you to organise the wedding but making you just the babysitter after promising you to attend the wedding normally is a huge dick move.", "Good question! I would probably call the kid's mother and tell Shane to bugger off. I feel bad for the kids because I know how Shane can be and I feel for SIL because, while she may have influenced his behaviour ten years ago, I have heard that she did not have an easy marriage."]}
