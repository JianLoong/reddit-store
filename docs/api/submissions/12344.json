Her therapist is predatory and out of line. It's troubling that he would use his position of power to groom younger people into dating him.\n\nIt's the perfect example of sometimes, you need to sacrifice a friendship in order to save your friend. She'll thank you later when she realizes that you made her dodge a bullet.", "NTA. \n\nI might get downvoted for this, but he is a predator. Setting aside the fact that he is in a position of authority over her, and this is why dating your therapist isn't allowed. She is barely out of childhood. She might never talk to you, but when she gets to my age, she'll be very thankful she had a friend like you.", "NTA. It\u2019s absolutely not okay for a therapist to date their client.  That goes for any age, but it\u2019s especially concerning given that he\u2019s in his 40s and your friend is a teenager. It sounds like predatory behavior on his part. He is taking advantage of your friend in a vulnerable situation. He should be reported and lose his license.", "NTA\n\nPlease report the therapist, although part of me wonders if this is something she's made up because she's got some issues she needs to work through and she's got a massive crush on her therapist so she's just saying she's with him. It seems weird that someone would throw away their career for a teenager. But there needs to be an investigation.", "NTA, the therapist is a predator and should lose their registration at the very least. You did the right thing", "NTA. Her therapist is taking advantage of her and their relationship is massively inappropriate.", "There's...a lot of layers to this one.\n\nThe fact it's her *therapist* is a big red flag. Age differences in relationships happen but this is different. This is a big breach of the patient/therapist relationship needed to properly do the therapy thing.\n\nA casual Google search will detail numerous horror stories of therapists overstepping their boundaries, including romantically. It's real scary stuff: They take advantage of their position to get what they want from you.\n\nYes on a technical standpoint your friend is an adult. Barely. And it seems like she's being manipulated by her therapist.\n\nNTA because that is a legitimate concern to have, but at this point don't know if you can do anything about it: Ratting her out to her folks will make her isolate from you and them which only plays into the therapist' hands.", "This is a deep one. There is that the element of other people's business, of other people's medical information, etc., etc. However, there are two sides to this that stick out.\n\nFirst, if this is 100% true, that therapist needs to be reported. That is the most inappropriate thing, he needs to be removed from that role of power for anyone. And it isn't helping your friend.\n\nSecond, it is possible that she sees the relationship that way and the therapist hasn't realized yet. She needs to change therapists, and he needs to step away. If he is professional and truly cares for her mental health, he will do that voluntarily.\n\nI'm ultimately going to go with NTA. She may be angry with you, you may lose a friend, but you're doing something I think is in her best interest.", "NTA. This is not OK AT ALL.", "NTA You are trying to protect your friend. You should also also report the therapist to his licensing board -- sleeping with a patient is so, so unethical.\n\nThis won't change my opinion for the better, and will probably make it worse: how long has he been her therapist??", "Her THERAPIST?? NTA!\n\nThat\u2019s an exploitative relationship \u2014 she\u2019s in a vulnerable position. It might even be against his code of ethics.", "NTA, a therapist having a relationship in any way other than a strictly professional one with their client is BEYOND inappropriate. He is definitely a predator.", "NTA. Does she realize he gets paid to listen to her? I feel for her because she's getting taken advantage of by a much older authority figure. Not to mention how flat-out wrong this is and if he's in the U.S., this is a violation of the APA code of ethics and could endanger his license (as it should). I'm disgusted by his behavior.", "NTA. The therapist absolutely knows he's breached professional ethics. He needs to be reported to the professional licensing board. Not all heroes wear capes. You did a good thing telling her parents. I hope her parents file a report against this predator therapist.", "A therapist? A person paid to listen to her troubles? Absolutely NTA.\n\nYes, your friend is legally an adult but holy shit. That is grossly unethical, unprofessional and honestly kinda predatory. Depending on where you live this may actually be violating the governing body's ethics and therefore absolutely should be brought to their attention. \n\nI do fear that this may mark the end of your friendship but I hope, in time, you'll both look back on this and recognise you've made the right call.", "NTA - your friend doesn\u2019t see it now but you\u2019ve saved her from a predator.", "nta, doesn't she realize as a therapist he is supposed to listen and understand her? If she is doing nothing wrong, then why was she embarrassed to tell them?", "NTA and I hope Cera\u2019s parents report him and he never gets the chance to be anyone else\u2019s \u2018therapist\u2019.\n\nThank you for putting Cera\u2019s physical and psychological safety ahead of your friendship with her. She\u2019ll understand you made the right call one day.", "NTA. That is woefully inappropriate and honestly kinda predatory. Sadly, I think it may result in the end of your friendship but perhaps if it gets her away from a creep then that's ultimately probably what's most important.", "I wonder how long this has been going on. She\u2019s 18 now which by law she\u2019s allowed to see him and him not go to jail. But I\u2019d bet everything this has been going on for awhile. NTA. This is also against the law actually to date a client. Parents need to really address this.", "NTA he needs to be reported, he needs to lose his license. He\u2019s taking advantage of her.", "Sus", "Without more info, I can't make a judgment.\n\nIs she still seeing him for paid counseling sessions?\n\nDo you have any proof besides her saying they are in a romantic relationship?", "Licenced therapists aren't allowed to have sex with their patients in pretty much every jusridiction. Tell her parents, tell his licensing board, tell the police.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA", "NTA, but you should be reporting him to his professional licensing body and getting his ass suspended before he takes advantage of more clients. Because that is some sick ass predatory shit", "NTA\n\nThat guy is a predator. She may not see it now, but a person in his position, at that age doing this is an abuse of power and will give an unfair power dynamic to your friend. He isn't the only one who \"gets\" her. He is a educated, clinically trained therapist who can \"get\" anyone. He is tricking her. If possible, you should report him either to the practice (if it isn't his) or the state/county/whatever medical board for improper contact with a patient", "NTA. He is a predator.

As a qualified psychotherapist myself, this is HIGHLY HIGHLY inappropriate.
