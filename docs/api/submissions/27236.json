On a more personal level, when people start planning on having children and are in the process of a pregnancy, they have this idea in their heads on what being a parent is going to be like, and often times that is about raising a specific gender (my daughter and I are going to play princesses, my son and I are going to play trains, I can relate closer to this gender because of my own life experiences and I'm afraid if they are a different gender I won't be as relevant to them). \n Again a lot of emotional baggage from their own childhoods but when the gender does not match the idea that they had in their head, they might have to mourn the loss of that idea, as silly as it sounds and that is called gender disappointment.

We are all born into a culture, raised by people with certain ideas and viewpoints, and it can be hard to shed that, or even realize that you've been raised in a mindset that isn't the most fair.  Boys can play dress up and play kitchen, and learn how to cook and bake do all sorts of things that girls can do. And girls can obviously play sports and get into Legos, work with their hands and can you pretty much everything that boys can do.

But it\u2019s just like.  There\u2019s a gift table n everything? N it\u2019s always so loaded.  This one girl god golden accented nikes for her baby boy that\u2019s not even born yet.  Like expensive ass sneakers for a baby.  I- I can\u2019t afford that man nvm a shit load of diapers", "people request specific gifts from guests? is it like a tradition of yours or what, how does that work?", "That's so strange. The only gender reveals I know of around where I live happen during a baby shower (or a baby tinkle, baby shower but with less gifts because the parents already have other children).", "arent those presents for the baby shower? do ppl have both? wow.\n\nwhere i live these things arent usually done, it's considered bad luck to buy anything for the baby before it arrives.", "I haven't seen those but I worry far less with the siblings disappointment than with a parents. I have seen some truly scary videos of men reacting with anger or even violence when they found out their child wasn't a boy.", "Women do get it too. My mom refused to believe I was a girl. Even after I was born and the proof was staring her in the face. She refused to hold me for a few hours after I was born. She had always wanted all sons like her sisters and I threw a wrench in that coming out female.", "How men have reacted in those videos has genuinely scared me.", ">have 3 separate birthing events to squeeze money and baby gifts out of all my family and friends\n\nYou are *so* behind the times. First you have a baby announcement party (guests are told \"important event, bring cash\"). Then you have the gender reveal party (guests bring gender-neutral gifts). Then you have the name reveal party (guests are told what monogram to use on their gifts). Then you have a baby room reveal party (guests bring expensive furniture, poor guests bring their painting clothes). Then the baby shower. Then the baby's coming out party (pun intended). Then baby's first haircut party...", "See now that is cute. Just something as simple as a cake with a color on the inside that takes up no more than 10-15 minutes of a regular \u2018get together\u2019 is perfectly acceptable IMO.", "We're expecting a baby in a few months. We plan to ask for donations of leftover baby stuff from our siblings who have slightly older children.\n\nSome of that stuff is on its fourth or fifth baby at this point.", "Yeah, that\u2019s what my sister did. She and her husband paid for the food and cake and held it at their house, no gifts required. Some relatives brought some, but nothing extravagant (diapers, bibs, a couple articles of clothing) as a thanks for the food. Not bad! I\u2019ll never understand these people who throw these lavish parties and half the time cause property damage just to announce what genitals their baby has. Weird.", "Not to mention a lot of these name brand kids shoes mess up kids feet and cause issues walking, my mom always had me strapped up with the striderites.", "You\u2019re getting a biased view because you\u2019re specifically seeing extreme baby showers.  It would be like working at Disney wedding venue and complaining that all brides spend the same as a car in their dresses.  You only see a select portion of the events, not the average event.", "People typically have a registry for these, just like other major events such as weddings. It's like an online gift list to a specific store, and when people buy stuff it gets checked off the list.  It's actually quite handy, and it can be presented as \"hey, there's no need to get us a gift, but if you do, here are some ideas\".\n\nI personally had one when I had a baby because people kept asking what to get and were going to buy gifts anyway, and this ensured we got stuff we could actually use with no duplicates. \n\nWhen I got married a long time ago we refused to do a registry because we thought it was tacky, and most of the non-cash gifts we got were just stored in the basement because we had no use for them but also didn't want to donate them because they had sentimental value. I am now pro-registry. \n\nBut I don't like gender reveals at all.", "i know you are joking but we're Jewish and as the first one was a boy, and this is what that entails (at least it's just the parents feeding everyone and presents are optional)\n\n1. his first friday night - ppl come over, we serve cake and drinks\n2. night before circumcision - kids come over to give a special blessing, we give them a treat\n3. circumcision and naming at 8 days - accompanied by cake in synagogue, and meal either at home or hall\n4. at one month old a special gathering because he's the oldest, many ppl come as it's pretty rare and another sit-down meal\n5. first haircut at 3 years old. more feeding\n\nand since we have the German custom, someone said we should do a party \"to give him a non-jewish name\" like some ppl use but we live in Israel so no point and anyway his name is Michael. i was done feeding ppl, almost no one does it and i threatened my husband that if i have to host this his name should be Jesus or Christian, as gentile as we can make it.", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "Hilarious", "Ohhh yeah, I love hand me downs, and people love getting rid of them too \ud83d\ude02", "Stride Rite! Yep, the standard school shoe, remember it well.", "oh this actually sounds like a good idea but it's also like an open invitation for some to take advantage of the guests' kindness", "With baby registries you also usually get 15-20% off of everything other people don't buy so it's worth doing. I told everyone at our baby shower gifts were optional but there was a registry if they wanted to get something. Most people wanted to buy baby stuff and got stuff we needed, some didn't want to get anything so they didn't.", "At least the baby is born by that point", "Oy vey!", ">night before circumcision - kids come over to give a special blessing, we give them a treat\n\nI'd also give the baby something.  Maybe a strong painkiller would be nice.  Not a fan of the procedure.", "That sounds like a wonderful tradition, and, except for blessings, it doesn\u2019t sound as if gifts are being demanded.", "In the UK, it was Clarks when I were a lass. \ud83d\ude0a", "Oh, for sure it can be. I just made sure I had gifts on there starting at a really low price, and no big-ticket items. Think $5-10US to $50US. So people with a very small budget could know they were giving something hand-picked that we would actually use, and people who wanted to spend more could just get multiple things.", "The baby may be born but mom is usually very sore as in full of stitches and also sleep deprived. I can't imagine hosting all of these things in the first week when it hurts to sit, let alone walk or sneeze or cough.", "that's very nice of you and all in all this sounds like a great idea i could use this thanks!!!"]}
