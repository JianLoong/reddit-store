On a more personal level, when people start planning on having children and are in the process of a pregnancy, they have this idea in their heads on what being a parent is going to be like, and often times that is about raising a specific gender (my daughter and I are going to play princesses, my son and I are going to play trains, I can relate closer to this gender because of my own life experiences and I'm afraid if they are a different gender I won't be as relevant to them). \n Again a lot of emotional baggage from their own childhoods but when the gender does not match the idea that they had in their head, they might have to mourn the loss of that idea, as silly as it sounds and that is called gender disappointment.

We are all born into a culture, raised by people with certain ideas and viewpoints, and it can be hard to shed that, or even realize that you've been raised in a mindset that isn't the most fair.  Boys can play dress up and play kitchen, and learn how to cook and bake do all sorts of things that girls can do. And girls can obviously play sports and get into Legos, work with their hands and can you pretty much everything that boys can do.

The drinks were pink.  The cake was pink.  Was fun!", "I\u2019ve always said that gender reveals are a way to get men to go to a baby shower.", "This is at the top of the list of meetings that could have been an e-mail!", "Normal gender reveal parties are just close family and *maybe* a couple friends with no expectation of gifts, and they last a couple hours. At the end everyone has cake. It's literally a nothing event that isn't a big deal to most people that have them. OP's brother is the AH for making it out to be more important than it is. Pretty much anything that would be more important than the average family get together is a bigger deal than a gender reveal.\n\nReddit has a very warped and deluded idea of what most people do because they've seen videos of people firing an AR-15 at high explosives that explode into pink/blue flames that burn down a state park.", "That doesn't make any sense, he also conflicted with another family member's birthday. You're reaching dude. He just catered to the girlfriend's family over his own and he's mad that they won't change their plans for him now that he did that.", "I would bet money he promptly forgot all about it and the date mentioned and never told his girlfriend about it either and now their party is all set in stone.", "I think gender reveal parties are lame. \n\nBut, it is extremely exciting to find out the sex of your baby. One of the few things you know about your little one before they arrive.", "When you speak like a sociopath, everything is creepy and disturbing. You should speak to a therapist about your anti-social behavior. It's not weird to celebrate the announcement of a boy or girl. Whatever the hell you are thinking is definitely weird and disturbing though.", "Knowing your kid is gonna be a boy or a girl is disturbing. Dramatic much", "The fact you accostiate it with being an obsession with genitalia is bizarre at best very concerning at worst. It has nothing to do with that it\u2019s about whether you are having a son or a daughter. A huge distinction that will affect the rest of your lives. Maybe the parties are dumb but being excited about finding out the sex of your baby is neither creepy or anything else you are trying to imply. Just a creepy take in my opinion. You are reading rage bait on Reddit too much", "That is all it should be, maybe a 5 minute Zoom call.", "I've traveled from out of state for a friend's gender reveal. Honestly, food and getting to see people I hadn't seen for awhile made it worth it. No one I know who has had one does gifts either, so it's probably the most chill type of party outside of basic bbq/cookouts.", "Then, the gender reveal is effectively the baby shower. It's still the shower then, but it has a different name. That is acceptable. As long as it's a single event, that's fine.", "Congratulations on your snack", "Not only that, also paid for the bus", "\ud83e\udd79 I love this so much", "No, this is in Australia where they\u2019re a pretty rare item to begin with.", "I thought gender reveals were part of a baby shower. Are they separate events??", "TIL that I did mine all wrong. I had a combination baby shower/gender reveal as 1 event & I was tickled to receive hand-me-down clothes, etc, as gifts.", "Not usually, at least none of the many gender reveals I have been to included gifts.", "Not always. I had a gender reveal for our first and if anyone asked we said no Gift. I think only one or two people brought gifts but we told them it was completely unnecessary. If you expect a gift at a gender reveal it better be a shower/ reveal combo.", "Ours was just a party. It was truly just an excuse to tell everyone at the same time with good food. We got two cards, a candle, and perfume. Probably 30 guests at least half were direct family. \n\nwe didn\u2019t expect anything even the cards were a surprise. Certainly kind, but absolutely not expected. Like I said. Excuse to eat and get together. \n\nThat\u2019s what a baby shower is for.\n\nAnd for that matter, plenty of family couldn\u2019t be there for this that or the other thing. People got lives and jobs and things.", "Ah, sorry mate, if you ever get the gumption/chance to try a salted soft freshly baked pretzel with honey mustard dipping sauce (salty, sweet and tangy) I\u2019d highly recommend it. Would easily scarf down two of those in a blink of an eye \ud83e\udd24\ud83d\ude2e\u200d\ud83d\udca8", "Are you thinking about baby showers? I've never been to a gender reveal with a gift expectation, the stuff your describing would usually be given at the shower (at least in my experience)", "Why would someone in their right mind would have a preference?? \ud83e\udd26", ">I have only ever seen a man be butthurt about the gender of a baby.\n\nNah, women will too, but usually only after having 4 or 5 boys in a row and no girls.", "If the gender reveal had a pretzel stand it would be exponentially better though.", "Might be blown out of proportion on here for gender reveal parties. Baby showers absolutely do have gifts. I actually don\u2019t know anyone who\u2019s had a gender reveal party w gifts since 2020, considering the mockery of them on the internet lol", "i feel like you\u2019re just upset people have support systems. you deserve that too yknow. 90% of the time a baby shower is thrown by someone else, not the parents. usually the pregnant persons mom or aunt. and i\u2019ve never ever heard of a gender reveal where you bring a gift, and i\u2019ve probably been to 10 of them.", "What about the child's pronoun selection party?", "See I don't mind them so much as part of the baby shower like that. It's when it's a whole separate thing that it's annoying and stupid", "YUP! I REMEMBER THAT ONE! Her ex husband was an absolute TOOL. And had the audacity to talk about wanting to raise the son she\u2019s having with her fianc\u00e9. \n\nThere\u2019s another story where a man filed for divorce with papers his mommy drew up when they found out the baby was a girl. AND had the audacity to try and sue for full custody despite the fact that he called the child a \u201cthing and creature\u201d and that he\u2019s sure he\u2019ll grow to love her. Thankfully mom was able to get full custody and him no rights.\n\nImagine having hatred for a child solely for their genitalia. It\u2019s so fucking weird.", "Which is crazy cause I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true. I have family with boys who have been extremely difficult kids, even violent as toddlers\u2026.and my daughter isn\u2019t like that at all. Kids are all different.", "actually according to our German custom we can cut whenever (some ppl have a hard time believing this) the waiting until 3 is more Chassidic but we do it anyway because everyone does it. we had 2 with shoulder length hair (one was born hairy the other bald until 1 year old) and the third had very slow hair grow so barely anything to cut. but some kids have very long.", "technically but since he has a whole religion etc we would never name a kid after him. \n\ni mean his Jewish name was Yehoshua right? my youngest is called that LOL i just realized.", "This would actually be completely hilarious with the right group of people!", "A friend threw a ball-themed party for her orchiectomy. It was so much fun.", "I cried cause I tried Thai rice and it was BETTER than my Chinese spot.", "I much prefer being the auntie who was there for each of my BFF's four births (first child day of to visit the others to watch previous kiddos) because then I got to cuddle the sleeping baby on my chest. I may have sipped water or something while cuddling LOL."]}
