I asked my husband to clean out the fridge so we had room for new groceries. There were a few items marked expired that he missed (bagels that expired 3 weeks ago according to the use-by-date, blueberries that were shriveled up, leftover veggies in Tupperware that were visibly past their prime, old unappetizing takeout leftovers, etc) so I threw them away. I didn't criticize him, I didn't say anything, I wasn't like \"How did you miss this?\" I just threw them away and got on with life.\n\nHe came up to me and with an agitated tone of voice and his pupils huge, he asked why I was doing that. I was immediately kind of feeling defensive and on edge because of his tone and big pupils, and I said because they're expired or inedible. He said they were fine, he did a good job, and I wasted his time asking him to help if I was just going to go behind him and finish the job. I said I just disagree that they are fine, so I threw them away. It's a difference of opinion of what's worth keeping and what's not. No big deal in my eyes.\n\nHe said I should trust him to do the whole job if I'm going to do the job and wanted me to apologize to him. I said I didn't want to apologize if I didn't understand what I was even apologizing for so can he please explain what I did wrong? He explained again and I said I didn't agree with his thoughts (that I wasted his time and I should have just done it myself) so I still don't get what I did wrong.\n\nThat got him really mad. He insisted the items he missed were \"fine.\" He even pulled the 3-week expired bagels out of the trash and said \"This bagel is fine. I'll eat it tomorrow.\" Like WTF, dude? You haven't eaten it in the month we've had it and now you're going to eat it out of spite?\n\nThe discussion spiraled out of control where it was basically him wanting me to apologize for doing something wrong when I feel like I didn't DO anything wrong. I can still care about his feelings and perspective even when I disagree with him, which I stated.\n\nI'm blown away. He absolutely insists he was the victim of the situation and it was all my fault. He said I was being controlling for throwing away things I KNEW beforehand were bad. It turned into a very big argument where I basically felt like I was reasoning with a kid throwing a tantrum.\n\nI eventually lost it as well and said \"You missed expired and inedible food. You didn't finish the job but you did help. I took care of it. What's your problem?\" Of course, he latched onto it when I lost my temper and not the twenty minutes before when I was calm.\n\nAITA?\n\nTL;DR I asked my husband to clean out the fridge to make room for new groceries that were about to be delivered while I cooked dinner. He did and missed several expired and inedible items. I didn't say anything and just threw them away.

He was proud of the poor job of cleaning out the refrigerator he did and lacks the emotional maturity to handle the shame he feels about you having to go in a fix an obvious deficiency with his work.  The fact that he escalated to anger and gaslighting when confronted with the issue is a pretty bad sign.\n\nedit: I don't like my use of the word confronted here.

Has this type of thing happened before, or was this the first instance of absolutely nuts behaviour of him?", "NTA. Sounds like you guys have a hard time communicating because of him. He needs individual therapy and couples therapy. And you need to stop taking this crap. My boyfriend and I will sometime raise our voices at each other over things like this, but with smiles on our faces because it's playful banter. And we joke around knowing we both had faults. This sounds like a one side fault situation where for some reason, you are the one getting yelled at and asked to apologize when it was all his fault to begin with. If he doesn't apologize to you, and own up to his BS, I would say you go to therapy individually and we go as a couple too, or it's over. Life is too short to be doing the grocery shopping, and cleaning out the fridge all on your own, while also not being allowed to throw away expired food. Nobody should have to \"allow\" you to do anything in your joint fridge. I'm sorry but it sounds like a hard pass for me", "NTA this sounds like weaponized incompetence. \"If I can't do it right you shouldn't ask me to do it at all\". Nope.", "NTA, In our house whoever cleans the fridge will end up missing something.", "NTA, but your husband sounds exhausting!

NTA.", "NTA of course, but this is one of those rare situations where you didn't do anything wrong but yet he still has a reason to be annoyed. He feels like you throwing those extra things out was grading his work, and...it was. Nobody likes to be told they didn't do a job well, even though you told him as indirectly and politely as possible. You handled it well at first and got pushed into saying some things you wished you hadn't. If it comes up again or you still feel unresolved just tell him you didn't mean to make him feel criticized or attacked.", "Wow, do you live in my house.  It's funny that this type of situation happens way to often in my house and in my neighbor's and friends.  \nI am finding that men don't pay as much attention to details. I try not to engage with an argument if I can remember to just take a deep breath and hold my response. \nNTA but this might help if a situation like this occurs in the future.  My neighbors teenage boy was looking for something in the refrigerator,  which of course was right In front of him. He told his mother that they were out of the item. She responded no we're not,  do you want to borrow my virgina so you can find it? Remembering this always makes me smile which means my response to my husband is usually in a light hearted tone and it defuses the situation.", "NTA. If you want something done right, do it yourself. He probably did this on purpose to get out of the chore so you won\u2019t ask him to do it again. Sounds like a control tactic. Would keep an eye on this. Red flag!", "NTA, I do think your husband could benefit from some one-on-one therapy, and that you both could benefit from couples therapy if this is a regular occurrence. He definitely was overreacting to the situation at hand. A normal response if someone noticed their partner doing this, would be to ask what they missed and maybe apologize for missing it or just thanking you for getting those last few items out of the fridge. \n\nThis kind of anger to a basic situation makes me think something else was causing him to be angry. Maybe something happened at work, or with one of his friends, or maybe he's angry about something else entirely in the relationship and he was just looking for a reason to start an argument. Either way, it's no excuse to treat another human this way, let alone your partner.\n\nI would try to see if you can both talk about this in a calm manner, maybe in a different neutral setting. I know how it feels to remain calm throughout an argument until you finally get frustrated and reply with anger only to have your partner latch onto that and change the argument to being about that negative reaction ignoring the things that led to it. I'm not diagnosing anyone by any means, but that is a tactic a lot of narcassists use to \"win\" arguments.", "#NTA\n\nApologise and serve him only the items that he missed throwing out till they are finished.

Not sure why, just couldn't get past that.", "NTA. My wife and I used to go round and round about this as well. I agree with your husband that \"use by\" dates are more like guidelines than hard and fast rules, but you only did what you thought was right. In his place, I would disagree with you as well, but his anger is extreme and out of proportion to the issue.", "NTA.   Your husband didn't enjoy cleaning out the fridge.  If you were to criticize the job he did, he could say \"if you don't like how I do it, do it yourself.\"   But you didn't criticize, so now he's frustrated.   Now how is he going to discourage you from ever asking him to do that task?   He was literally looking for a reason to blow up at you.   You could have moved the butter from one shelf to the other and you'd have gotten the same reaction.    \n\n\nThis man is unstable.  I know as women we're told to stand by our man and show the world you love him blah blah blah, but  you're under no obligation to waste your life under that kind of oppression.

He overreacted but honestly his comments about you eating his time and just doing it yourself makes me think he's using weaponize incompetentance so you just won't ever ask him again", "NTA - 3 week old expired bagels and shriveled up berries are not a *difference of opinion*. \n\nLook up weaponized incompetence.  Your husband is gunning for poster child. I've not yet heard of someone doing a shitty job on a task and starting a fight when his wife finished the job without even griping at him.", "NAH. not a popular opinion but did he grow up in a household with food insecurities or any trauma around food? I've heard of instances where children grew up with an unhealthy relationship with food and will get triggered when throwing out food that's \"still good\". Some examples would be having to eat everything on your plate before leaving the dinner table, food shouldn't be wasted, etc.", "Sorry, ESH.\n\nYou asked him to clean out the fridge, and he did. Clearly, what he felt was still \"good\" food was not the same conclusion as yours.\n\nBOTH OF YOU sit down and have an adult conversation. You claiming he \"didn't finish his job\" was condescending. And what was \"unappetizing takeout leftovers\" was your judgement, but clearly not his.\n\nHe also didn't need to be aggressive or necessarily that angry towards you. It's likely he feels like it's wasteful to throw out food he deemed otherwise edible. When you asked him to clean it out, you were also asking him to make that decision.\n\nHe's your husband, not your kid. And yes, there are times that \"expired\" dates are not accurate, and our society wastes and throws away a ton of otherwise edible food.", "ESH you told him to do something and then immediately after, you went and checked his work and corrected it...

I suspect that the meds are a bandaid on much deeper and pathological issues than depression.  I always kind of knew on some level he was intentionally cruel, but I was drowning in the cognitive dissonance because of the intermittent reinforcement.  And he is a champion gaslighter.

Very important read for understanding this treatment. https://ia800108.us.archive.org/30/items/LundyWhyDoesHeDoThat/Lundy_Why-does-he-do-that.pdf", "You married my ex husband??", "And yet you stay with him...trust me I went through 8 years with a guy like this and it nearly destroyed me. I hope that you figure out if this is the kind of treatment you want for the rest of your life, because apologies notwithstanding, they never really change.", "Or if he's like my husband - 3 visits to a psychologist and he thinks the problem's solved. Seriously...", "You said you're with him because your family of origin sucks, whilst calling your family of present an asshole. It's possible that your family growing up set the bar low and created toxic, but comfortable patterns and here you are. If you have kids: do you want them to grow up how you did? If you don't, it's easier to leave.", "YTA changed my vote, do not keep exposing your child to this man!   When you're child is an adult and f'ed up are you going try and justify yourself be saying you did this for them (child)?", "This comment breaks my heart.", "This cracks me up.  Like microplaning raisined up blueberries.   Holding back cackles.", "Hey reddit sibling! It was not unusual for my mom to be met with \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d/\u201cmy condolences\u201d upon meeting my father\u2019s colleagues either. \n\nAll I ever wanted was for them to get divorced. But alas, misery loves company!", "What are you getting out of this relationship?", "Do you think he\u2019s a narcissist? From what you describe he does seem to have a lot of narcissistic traits. NTA", "If leaving the relationship feels like too big a step, you could think about something smaller. What if you just talk to a divorce attorney. You'd get more information and you don't need tell him about it or do anything with that info right away. Or you could do a trial separation, and see how you feel with some space.", "He has already proven who he is. \n\nBased on your comments about his lackluster commitment to improving his mental health (while also not being able to see that he\u2019s the problem), it sounds like he can\u2019t or won\u2019t change. \n\nYou deserve better. You\u2019re see his DARVO\u2019ing and see the patterns. Why stick around for more? \n\nI dated a man like this once. It ended with physical abuse.\n\nI didn\u2019t see it for what it was until the moment he hit me. You see it for what it is NOW. Please choose safety, quickly, before it gets worse.", "Please keep records and proof of his behavior so that you can use it when determining custody to protect your child.", "Listen to yourself here. You CAN have a good relationship. YOU are capable of being happy. YOU are putting in the work to heal, become healthier, become the best version of you that you can be. \n\nWhat\u2019s he doing?\n\nI\u2019ve done intensive EMDR work since I left my abusive ex and it\u2019s real. I know where you\u2019re at. Fortunately, my past relationship was LD which made it easy to cut ties. Being married is a whole different league of challenging, but I am confident you can get through it. You and your child deserve it.", "OP, does he even like you? What good does he bring to your life to outweigh these negatives? What would you say to a friend if you saw their partner treating them this way?", "Sunk cost fallacy is all OP is getting out of this relationship.", "I've been reading through your responses OP, and I can't stress enough that you need to get out of that environment now. I've been there, as a child with a father who did this and as a spouse whose partner did this. My dad still hasn't confronted/accepted his narcissism and clear abuse of my mother and I, but my partner figured it out. They cheated on me with someone who called themselves my best friend, then we put ourselves in couples therapy. The people conducting the therapy noticed the abuse and waited until they were alone to confront them, and after getting very angry and defensive about it, they accepted it and have been working to improve. You can message me if you want to talk privately, this is as detailed as I want to get here. \n\nNTA and you are 100% a victim of emotional abuse and manipulation from a narcissist. Get out before it turns physical, please, especially if there are children involved.", "Just in case everyone else's comments and advice didn't make it clear that you are a victim here, I'd like to point out a detail that stood out to me in your original post-- you noticed the dilation of his pupils. I *never* notice how dilated a person's pupils are or aren't, and I'd guess most people in most normal interactions don't notice that either. The fact that you saw that tiny detail says to me that you're in a state of hypervigilance with regards to your partner, and have learned the signs of potential danger to be on the lookout for. That is a clear sign of trauma and abuse. Do with that information what you will, but rest assured that you are absolutely NTA here.", "You can always make a new family, OP.  This situation sounds absolutely terrible for you. I\u2019m not there, but it doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re with a man who SHOULD be family.", "Yes, but do you want to live in a broken home because you came from one?  NTA", "you are allowed to leave.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA", "Happy cake day :-)"]}
