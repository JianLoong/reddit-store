I asked my husband to clean out the fridge so we had room for new groceries. There were a few items marked expired that he missed (bagels that expired 3 weeks ago according to the use-by-date, blueberries that were shriveled up, leftover veggies in Tupperware that were visibly past their prime, old unappetizing takeout leftovers, etc) so I threw them away. I didn't criticize him, I didn't say anything, I wasn't like \"How did you miss this?\" I just threw them away and got on with life.\n\nHe came up to me and with an agitated tone of voice and his pupils huge, he asked why I was doing that. I was immediately kind of feeling defensive and on edge because of his tone and big pupils, and I said because they're expired or inedible. He said they were fine, he did a good job, and I wasted his time asking him to help if I was just going to go behind him and finish the job. I said I just disagree that they are fine, so I threw them away. It's a difference of opinion of what's worth keeping and what's not. No big deal in my eyes.\n\nHe said I should trust him to do the whole job if I'm going to do the job and wanted me to apologize to him. I said I didn't want to apologize if I didn't understand what I was even apologizing for so can he please explain what I did wrong? He explained again and I said I didn't agree with his thoughts (that I wasted his time and I should have just done it myself) so I still don't get what I did wrong.\n\nThat got him really mad. He insisted the items he missed were \"fine.\" He even pulled the 3-week expired bagels out of the trash and said \"This bagel is fine. I'll eat it tomorrow.\" Like WTF, dude? You haven't eaten it in the month we've had it and now you're going to eat it out of spite?\n\nThe discussion spiraled out of control where it was basically him wanting me to apologize for doing something wrong when I feel like I didn't DO anything wrong. I can still care about his feelings and perspective even when I disagree with him, which I stated.\n\nI'm blown away. He absolutely insists he was the victim of the situation and it was all my fault. He said I was being controlling for throwing away things I KNEW beforehand were bad. It turned into a very big argument where I basically felt like I was reasoning with a kid throwing a tantrum.\n\nI eventually lost it as well and said \"You missed expired and inedible food. You didn't finish the job but you did help. I took care of it. What's your problem?\" Of course, he latched onto it when I lost my temper and not the twenty minutes before when I was calm.\n\nAITA?\n\nTL;DR I asked my husband to clean out the fridge to make room for new groceries that were about to be delivered while I cooked dinner. He did and missed several expired and inedible items. I didn't say anything and just threw them away.

He was proud of the poor job of cleaning out the refrigerator he did and lacks the emotional maturity to handle the shame he feels about you having to go in a fix an obvious deficiency with his work.  The fact that he escalated to anger and gaslighting when confronted with the issue is a pretty bad sign.\n\nedit: I don't like my use of the word confronted here.

Has this type of thing happened before, or was this the first instance of absolutely nuts behaviour of him?", "NTA. Sounds like you guys have a hard time communicating because of him. He needs individual therapy and couples therapy. And you need to stop taking this crap. My boyfriend and I will sometime raise our voices at each other over things like this, but with smiles on our faces because it's playful banter. And we joke around knowing we both had faults. This sounds like a one side fault situation where for some reason, you are the one getting yelled at and asked to apologize when it was all his fault to begin with. If he doesn't apologize to you, and own up to his BS, I would say you go to therapy individually and we go as a couple too, or it's over. Life is too short to be doing the grocery shopping, and cleaning out the fridge all on your own, while also not being allowed to throw away expired food. Nobody should have to \"allow\" you to do anything in your joint fridge. I'm sorry but it sounds like a hard pass for me", "NTA this sounds like weaponized incompetence. \"If I can't do it right you shouldn't ask me to do it at all\".

NTA.", "NTA of course, but this is one of those rare situations where you didn't do anything wrong but yet he still has a reason to be annoyed. He feels like you throwing those extra things out was grading his work, and...it was. Nobody likes to be told they didn't do a job well, even though you told him as indirectly and politely as possible. You handled it well at first and got pushed into saying some things you wished you hadn't. If it comes up again or you still feel unresolved just tell him you didn't mean to make him feel criticized or attacked.", "Wow, do you live in my house.  It's funny that this type of situation happens way to often in my house and in my neighbor's and friends.  \nI am finding that men don't pay as much attention to details. I try not to engage with an argument if I can remember to just take a deep breath and hold my response. \nNTA but this might help if a situation like this occurs in the future.  My neighbors teenage boy was looking for something in the refrigerator,  which of course was right In front of him. He told his mother that they were out of the item. She responded no we're not,  do you want to borrow my virgina so you can find it? Remembering this always makes me smile which means my response to my husband is usually in a light hearted tone and it defuses the situation.", "NTA. If you want something done right, do it yourself. He probably did this on purpose to get out of the chore so you won\u2019t ask him to do it again. Sounds like a control tactic. Would keep an eye on this. Red flag!", "NTA, I do think your husband could benefit from some one-on-one therapy, and that you both could benefit from couples therapy if this is a regular occurrence. He definitely was overreacting to the situation at hand. A normal response if someone noticed their partner doing this, would be to ask what they missed and maybe apologize for missing it or just thanking you for getting those last few items out of the fridge. \n\nThis kind of anger to a basic situation makes me think something else was causing him to be angry. Maybe something happened at work, or with one of his friends, or maybe he's angry about something else entirely in the relationship and he was just looking for a reason to start an argument. Either way, it's no excuse to treat another human this way, let alone your partner.\n\nI would try to see if you can both talk about this in a calm manner, maybe in a different neutral setting. I know how it feels to remain calm throughout an argument until you finally get frustrated and reply with anger only to have your partner latch onto that and change the argument to being about that negative reaction ignoring the things that led to it. I'm not diagnosing anyone by any means, but that is a tactic a lot of narcassists use to \"win\" arguments.", "#NTA\n\nApologise and serve him only the items that he missed throwing out till they are finished.

Not sure why, just couldn't get past that.", "NTA. My wife and I used to go round and round about this as well. I agree with your husband that \"use by\" dates are more like guidelines than hard and fast rules, but you only did what you thought was right. In his place, I would disagree with you as well, but his anger is extreme and out of proportion to the issue.", "NTA.   Your husband didn't enjoy cleaning out the fridge.  If you were to criticize the job he did, he could say \"if you don't like how I do it, do it yourself.\"   But you didn't criticize, so now he's frustrated.   Now how is he going to discourage you from ever asking him to do that task?   He was literally looking for a reason to blow up at you.   You could have moved the butter from one shelf to the other and you'd have gotten the same reaction.    \n\n\nThis man is unstable.  I know as women we're told to stand by our man and show the world you love him blah blah blah, but  you're under no obligation to waste your life under that kind of oppression.

He overreacted but honestly his comments about you eating his time and just doing it yourself makes me think he's using weaponize incompetentance so you just won't ever ask him again", "NTA - 3 week old expired bagels and shriveled up berries are not a *difference of opinion*. \n\nLook up weaponized incompetence.  Your husband is gunning for poster child. I've not yet heard of someone doing a shitty job on a task and starting a fight when his wife finished the job without even griping at him.", "NAH. not a popular opinion but did he grow up in a household with food insecurities or any trauma around food? I've heard of instances where children grew up with an unhealthy relationship with food and will get triggered when throwing out food that's \"still good\". Some examples would be having to eat everything on your plate before leaving the dinner table, food shouldn't be wasted, etc.", "Sorry, ESH.\n\nYou asked him to clean out the fridge, and he did. Clearly, what he felt was still \"good\" food was not the same conclusion as yours.\n\nBOTH OF YOU sit down and have an adult conversation. You claiming he \"didn't finish his job\" was condescending. And what was \"unappetizing takeout leftovers\" was your judgement, but clearly not his.\n\nHe also didn't need to be aggressive or necessarily that angry towards you. It's likely he feels like it's wasteful to throw out food he deemed otherwise edible. When you asked him to clean it out, you were also asking him to make that decision.\n\nHe's your husband, not your kid. And yes, there are times that \"expired\" dates are not accurate, and our society wastes and throws away a ton of otherwise edible food.", "ESH you told him to do something and then immediately after, you went and checked his work and corrected it...

I suspect that the meds are a bandaid on much deeper and pathological issues than depression.  I always kind of knew on some level he was intentionally cruel, but I was drowning in the cognitive dissonance because of the intermittent reinforcement.  And he is a champion gaslighter.

But then, it's long past the question of who's right, and well into the territory of \"why do you want to live this way?\"\n\nI only wish I'd learned 20+ years ago that the concept of \"this relationship does not meet my needs\" was a fully valid reason to move on. It's just so great on this side.", "Thank you! Just gotta last another day or so.", "if I took that quiz with my ex it would be just as high a score, he was a poopshow. I am glad you are leaving, that is a good and right first step. Depending on your parents, I would tell them, but I am not someone to set an example by, it took 2 years after the break up to come clean to my mom, but by that time I was ready to talk. Good luck on your new and exciting journey!", "Sounds like the sunk cost fallacy, and my own experience of wondering \"wait, didn't he start off without this awful bullshit?\" I should have left my ex 6 months before I did, and could have left with a plan instead of a final straw blow-up, but reminded myself that wE WeRe maKIng PRoGreSs. It was the longest relationship I'd ever been in, I would have died a slow death by staying in it, and being single is delicious.\n\nBest of luck to you, OP. If you're ready, do you have a safety net to help you get out and moved?", "I'll probably open up after the holidays. Gotta call my insurance and see what therapy options I have, I know I need it. Luckily I have audio and pictures of some of the worst shit. \n\nThank you!!", "Info: Did your husband grow up or live with food scarcity?\n\nWhen my now husband and I first started dating, this was an argument we had. My privileged (and idiot) self didn't understand why he would keep things past the best by date. He explained that it was from a childhood of being quite poor and wasting food was not an option.", "This sounds abusive OP, you\u2019re NTA tho", "Yikes. NTA. Your husband is unhinged. Please protect yourself. He seems dangerous.", "ESH\n\nthe use by dates are arbitrary and meaningless. Unless there was visible mold and the food smelled bad it was likely still ok to eat. Check out r/DumpsterDiving. People pull food out of the trash that's still good all the time and eat it!\n\nyour husband shouldn't have over reacted like that, but you should also have talked to him about it in more detail before just chucking things. This could have been a teachable moment for both of you about how each others minds work and what your individual value systems were on food. But neither of you did that. \n\nYou tossed food that may or may not have actually been rotten (without pics I can't say which) and he over reacted to you criticizing his work indirectly.", "It\u2019s kinda disappointing on how the quiz doesn\u2019t take into account neglect as a form of emotional abuse. Only the more jealousy/controlling obvious stuff.", "My ex and I need to meet to exchange all our crap we left at each other's places. I think she thinks we're going to be friends still.  \n\n\nAs if I didn't need any other reason to not want that, she just scored me a 50.", "I think it should become a standard response from women everywhere.", "Oh yeah, no problem. Thank you for being considered and thinking about me.", "You\u2019re welcome but really, I am just trying to calm down a bit. I grew up in a situation similar but not like yours and at the time my mother got out with a lot of negative stuff and a couple of broken bones. She got me and my sib three years after because my bio deadbeat would have killed her if she so much as got me, so, I just want to make sure you are safe. \n\nThis situations are hard to live with..", "Start doing what you can to get money. Sell some things, say you need more money than you do for groceries and keep the change, ask safe friends and family if they can be there for you when you need to get out. 58 is so high. I took the quiz and I got a 0. You deserve a 0 relationship score, too. So do your kids.", "Oh my dear, I grew up in a HORRIBLE family and it took me decades and a lot of therapy to finally realize that I was repeating what I was used to and didn't know I deserved better.  Get out now and start giving yourself the love and understanding you deserve before you waste any more time in abusive situations.  Once you finally realize that you are worth more than that, it's like being able to really breathe for the first time.", "Hey, I'm not shaming him for the baldness or being fat, I'm not a supermodel or anything close but he thinks he looks better than Chris Evans or something.", "I'm so sorry, OP. Do you have a therapist of your own to help walk through why you deserve so much better than this, and how there is a world out here with more than these assholes? A good therapist can also help you prep at spotting red flags earlier on, and setting your own lines in self-defense.", "I don't know what country you are in but I recommend contacting a domestic violence shelter for advice on how to safely get out of this relationship.", "My ex improved marginally and even credited it partly to my patience...  But the second I tried to discuss the ways he emotionally hurt me, I was both overly sensitive and being coddled by everyone else, when he was just trying to be straight with me. My friends were pissed at him for trying to put convenient lies in their mouths. So, so much for getting better. Even if he got better, would you really want to spend the rest of your life tied to someone who's done this to you, OP?", "NTA. Does your husband do drugs (huge pupils and irrational behavior)?", "NTA sounds like he was on drugs tbh.", "Let him eat it", "You struck a nerve. Is it possible he has undiagnosed PTSD?", "Maybe he was in a funk? If this is abnormal behavior I\u2019d be wondering if he was getting sick or had something happen at work or with his family. Sometimes people are just in a mood to fight, sounds like he picked a really dumb one. \n\nI hope for you it\u2019s an odd out of sorts situation that you can both move past- if not, if this is a frequent occurrence I would take this as another big red flag and reevaluate what\u2019s going on", "NTA His strong response makes me wonder how he was treated as a child if he didn\u2019t complete a task correctly. Another cause could be growing up with food insecurity so he doesn\u2019t want to throw food away. Adults who grew up with trauma can have outbursts that seem uncalled for to someone who grew up in a more supportive environment or someone who has worked through their trauma. Your reaction was perfectly reasonable.", "People with giant pupils don\u2019t usually eat bagels.", "You keep bagels in the fridge!?", "Wtf\u2026I just took that quiz and it gave me a 5 and told me my partner is abusive, but every single answer I gave was the opposite?!?

Usually after I\u2019ve stayed up all night finishing some project and not sleeping and on the brink of a breakdown because I volunteered for too many things all at once and am overwhelmed. \n\nSo that might be a false point against him, since he\u2019s usually trying to tell me to stop trying to please everyone and to take time for myself \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "You got this!", "Yes 100%. And you didn\u2019t waste his time, he wasted your time because you had to come behind him and finish the job.", "Please OP, take a break from him, just go stay with someone or in a hotel just for a few weeks and see how you feel, I promise you everything will be so much clearer and you\u2019ll be surprised at the sheer RELIEF. Not catering to him, not looking out to see his mood and watching for tiny things. Just taking care of yourself.\n\nI am not one to jump on the Reddit just dump his ass train, but your situation sounds abusive and unhealthy. You deserve your own happiness, please believe that \u2764\ufe0f", "This very much sounds like he was purposefully baiting you. He knew and goaded you until you finally lost it. NTA.", "NTA sounds like hubby might be on drugs.", "NTA\n\nThis is one giant red flag. Please don't remain married to this guy any longer if he's going to be like this over the simplest of things", "Ok so this is a massive red flag situation.  This is manipulative behaviour and is something that I have experienced from an abusive partner.   Please take care of yourself.   Get your sh\u00a3t together.   Get ready to move and get away.   This will only escalate I am sorry.  You are NTA  your other half most certainly is", "NTA\n\nYour hyperalert awareness about the size of his pupils is troubling. It suggests that you don't feel safe around your husband, and you need to be constantly checking for signs of 'agitation'?\n\nThis entire 'argument' between the two of you appeared to be caused by HIM wanting to pick a fight over nothing. Does he do this often? Pick fights over nothing and push you into losing your temper, and then sit back sanctimoniously about how you raised YOUR voice during an argument that he pushed and pulled at? These are very common signs of emotional abuse.", "NTA but your husband sounds nuts. Or this is an act to make sure he never has to do that chore again.", "NTA your husband has anger issues.", "I scored a 27, should I be worried or will everything be okay, he's not physically abusive  but we fight a bit often but its usually it's over petty stuff", "Take extra care these next few days! I\u2019ve heard that when your abuser finds out/has an inkling that you\u2019re leaving that the abuse escalates to the point that your physical safety is in utmost danger. I wish you well, and I hope you get all the help and support to get your life back on track.", "If it talks like an asshole, walks like one... It's...an asshole", "Yeah which point it is matters.
