{"id": 20790, "submission_id": "14kzmfo", "title": "AITA for wanting to keep a can", "selftext": "Yeah, I'm not exaggerating in my title. That's literally it. \n\nI bought an energy drink that had a cool design on the can. I honestly mostly bought the drink just for the can, because it referenced a show I like. \n\nI live in a state where there's a deposit on bottles and cans. So basically you pay \u00a215 extra when you buy a drink, then when you recycle the can/bottle it came in you get your \u00a215 back, so you're encouraged to recycle it and not just throw it away. \n\nMy family has huge bags of these bottles we collect to get the deposit back, and my Mom uses the money she gets for groceries. A store near us will give you 20% more money back if you spend it at their store, so we literally make money by recycling. It's helpful and can pay for lunches for the week sometimes when it ads up. But... each individual can is still only \u00a215. Loosing one isn't a huge deal. \n\nWhen I finished my energy drink I cleaned out the can to put on my dresser and display. My mom saw it and told me I need to recycle it for money to \"help out the family.\" But... I bought it with my own money and it's worth more than \u00a215 to me. \n\nShe got mad at me for wanting to keep it. Even though I spent MY OWN MONEY on the drink and deposit, and that's the main reason I bought it. She told me \"this is hoarding behavior and that's not okay.\" and \"You should care more about us eating than keeping literal garbage.\" \n\nI told her no, she called me \"disrespectful.\" \n\nIt's a few cents...\n\nAm I crazy for thinking I'm not in the wrong here?", "created_utc": 1687926697, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14kzmfo/aita_for_wanting_to_keep_a_can/", "score": 79, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Give her $0.15 and keep the can.", "NTA. Give her a dollar and tell her to get over herself", "NTA. You bought it with your money, case closed.", "NTA, but have a calm talk with your mom and explain that it's not a \"can\", but it's an object that you like and want to keep around.", "NTA I have 3 cans .... definitely a hoarder.", "NTA, i have a can like that myself LOL", "NTA. You bought the can, it's yours. You can do whatever you want with it.", "NTA. It's your money to spend and your can to own.", "NTA. One can is not \"hoarding behavior\", how dramatic \ud83e\udd23", "nta but you totally could fill it with cement so it's unable to be recycled even if she tried", "NTA, but I think there's a good chance your mom will take that can while you're not looking. Would it be possible to buy another one and not open it? She can't recycle a drink you haven't drunk yet.", "nta, its cheap decoration. But moms are never  wrong\ud83d\ude06", "NTA. Hide it.", "NTA but your mom is probably not stoked to have an empty sodacan in your room on display, she considers it trash, you consider it treasure. Same goes the other way around for her lipstick \ud83d\ude09", "Lmao my brother got the basement to live in in our old house (basically your own apartment) and it had three of those small typical \"basement windows\" he plastered one with energy drink cans that looked nice. No particular reason for it he just did because he could and recycled them when he didn't want them anymore. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f As long as it's clean and doesn't attract insects then your mom should back off and chill.", "Go buy another one and don\u2019t open it", "Is it one of the Witcher energy drinks?", "NTA\n\nCan you fill the can with something (such as plaster or maybe tiling grout) that makes it no longer of value for her to recycle? That way, it won't blow around if a breeze came in and get dented/damaged and she will no longer want it, and you can keep it on display. I do this with cans I have drunken the contents of but like the design.", "Yeah idk why I didn't think of that\n\nAlthough I think she'd still be mad at me because \"it's hoarder behavior\"", "Why should he give her anything in the first place?", "By the reaction from mom, I doubt they can have a civil talk.  \n\n\nNTA.", "Omg I\u2019m so sorry for your big hoarding problem.

That way it hopefully won\u2019t trigger your mom and should look better than a can on your dresser.", "Scratch out the barcode if it can be done without messing up the design too much. You could file it off and paint on top of it or something so it doesn't look bad. You could then cut off the top and make it a pen holder or something so it could be useful.\n\nI also live in a country with that system \u270c\ufe0f yet people still throw cans next to the road... Well, free money for me.", "Or they'll keep it and that's cool too."]}
