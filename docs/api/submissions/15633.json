My niece is Zoe and my son is Cole. Zoe and Cole are very close. Zoe's dad was my childhood best friend. He and my sister got married a couple of years before Zoe was born and he died when she was 4 weeks old. After that my sister needed help so I had Zoe with me during the day because I was home while my boyfriend at the time, and now husband, worked. So Cole and Zoe have grown up very close and are like siblings more than cousins.\n\nThe name Ruby has been brought up a few times over the years. Cole told me Ruby was really mean to one of the kids in his friend group. Another time I heard from Cole and Zoe that Ruby got into trouble for pouring water over a bunch of kids lunches, including theirs. Another time she made fun of a child who started wearing glasses and didn't get cool ones but more bulky ones because the parents couldn't afford something more stylish and how she made her cry until she puked. There were other times her name was brought up as well. About 2 years ago my sister mentioned she was dating someone and said she didn't know if it was serious or not. Then a year ago she introduced him to everyone and his daughter, Ruby. My sister remarried 4 months after introducing them to everyone. Zoe and Cole were not happy. Ruby wasn't happy either but wasn't saying anything to me about it directly.\n\nMy sister was aware of the issues with Ruby and the fact there were some long standing bad feelings there. She was not deterred by this and instead she tried to pretend they were all new to each other and attempted to get Zoe and Cole to include Ruby in their play, and for them to be the three musketeers instead of two peas in a pod. Zoe told her mom it was never going to happen and that Ruby doesn't belong in the family. She got punished harshly for that. Cole told my sister he didn't like Ruby and just because she was Ruby's stepmom now, it didn't change anything. My sister looked for me to back her up and tell him it changed everything but I did not. She told me I should have had her back.\n\nA few days went by and then she told me we needed to talk and said I needed to support getting the kids to bond together and give Ruby a chance because she has no extended family and she's having a rough time in school. I asked my sister what she meant by that. She was reluctant to say. I asked if her husband was getting calls about how Ruby treats other kids. She didn't deny it. I told her she can't erase what Zoe and Cole think of Ruby and she needs to accept that. That Ruby has not proven to be a friend to them and they have more history with her being mean to others than they do with her being her stepdaughter.\n\nShe said they're 10 and have so much more room to grow. I told her this is true, but you can't ask people to like someone who is mean to them and their friends. My sister said I am being too hard on Ruby and I'm an AH for defending Ruby being excluded.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1682414121, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12ydt23/aita_for_telling_my_sister_she_cant_erase_what/", "score": 62, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your sister and her husband need to face up and deal with Ruby and her behavioural issues before trying to force her onto Zoe and Cole.\n\nIf Ruby continues on this path, she will go from being a mean little girl to being a mean adult. She obviously has issues which need addressed and maybe a therapist could assist her.\n\nUntil then your sister needs to back off trying to force the whole happy family scenario or the other kids are just going to dislike and resent her more.", "As I told the principal who tried to make my \"nice\" kids play with the class bully; her having no friends is a direct consequence of her behaviour. You have to help her get whatever help she needs to be a good person, and my children do not \"have\" to play with her. You forcing them makes you a bully too, and I will not tolerate anyone who forces my children to engage in behaviours or situations that make them uncomfortable. That's a dangerous precedent to set for many reasons. End of story. Your sister is T A. You are NTA", "NTA. That kid is obviously mean as F and I'm actually a bit taken aback, that your sister is trying to downplay that. You should never force kids to \"like\" or include someone who clearly bullied them and their friends and I'm actually questioning your sisters intelligence for acting like that.", "So your sister married the father of her and your kid\u2019s bully? And she\u2019s *shocked pikachu face* that they\u2019re not bonding? Wowowowow. NTA but your sister sure is.", "NTA - This isn\u2019t a workplace where Zoe and Cole have to get along with Ruby regardless of her behaviour. These are kids and her behaviour is *the only thing* that will change their minds.", "NTA\n\nSounds like Ruby has been lashing out at others for some time now. The kids aren\u2019t going to integrate into a family unit without her behavioral issues addressed, either through therapy, discipline, or a mix of both.", "NTA\n\nYou are having the kids' backs and I'm glad someone is. Your sister needs to listen a bit more to her daughter. It's good she's trying to include her stepdaughter but she would be better putting that energy into getting help for the very obvious bully nature this girl has. The girl has serious issues from the way it sounds and that's a larger problem then the kids not being open to trusting her right now.\n\nGood luck", "NTA. At her age it's really not Ruby's fault but her parents need to actively address her behavioral issues. I know this sub is full of 'go to therapy' suggestions but if it's a possibility to get Ruby some professional help then I don't think that's a bad idea. Based on my experience she does seem to be quite young to be getting into all this trouble.", "NTA at all. In any situation that involves step family, you can't force a connection. There's no law that says step siblings have to have a relationship. They need to treat each other with respect, sure. But they don't have to be buddies.", "NTA. Ruby is part of Zoe and Cole\u2019s blended family now. That\u2019s okay. At the same time, they already had a relationship. Not a good one. It would be nice for Ruby if her bad actions didn\u2019t have consequences. But that\u2019s not how the works works. It\u2019s not how Zoe and Cole work, and forcing them to pretend otherwise would send a terrible message to them. The appropriate message is \u201cRuby\u2019s now part of the family\u201d. I\u2019m not sure exactly what that changes - it probably means that Ruby will be present at more family events, perhaps even on a day to day basis. Maybe it means her behavior towards her new family members will change - time will tell. Until then, taking Zoe, Cole or Ruby that they have to feel differently is a terrible message. Their feelings are valid, and the reality of modern blended families is that not everyone likes everyone, and that\u2019s okay.", "NTA. She seems to want her own daughter Zoe and her nephew Cole to do all the attitude readjustment and \u2018grow\u2019.  Are she and Ruby\u2019s father having some serious come to Jesus sessions with Ruby about her behavior?", "NTA\n\nKids don't tend to be awful without a reason, so it's likely that Ruby was really struggling at home and didn't have the right supports and emotional outlets, so she acted out. Especially at the age you first heard about it, but even at 10, I can't really blame this on Ruby. She certainly has plenty of room to grow and change and become a perfectly lovely person.\n\nAt the same time, the other two have had nothing but bad experiences with her, and that doesn't magically go away because she's family now. They *do* need to understand that she's family, that she has just as much of a right to be in the family as they do, and that she's not going anywhere. They *don't* have to like it or to be her friend right away. Hopefully as they all grow up and Ruby recovers, they'll form a closer bond, but you can't force a bond on kids. If you try to force it, all you'll build is their resentment.", "NTA. Ruby is a bully. She is young enough to change but how can that happen if nobody does anything about it. She should probably be in therapy.", "NTA but I think your sister is just trying to get the kids to build a relationship since they are living under the same roof. Ruby is obviously troubled and this is probably due to not having a mom and having her dad spend his time with a new woman. Zoe and Cole are excluding Ruby in is what now her home and I get she's a bully but you as an adult shouldn't support them excluding her as well because she's a kid. Maybe you should also spend some time with Ruby. I honestly just don't want people to give up on Ruby because she can be helped at this point in her life. You and your sister can be the women in her life that she never had and teach her not to bully. That being said I am impressed with the boundaries these kids have. You guys must have raised them well. I recommend getting Ruby some help if nothing else works, but I honestly don't think shunning should be the answer.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Reach back into your memory and find the name of child your sister could not stand when you were kids. Ask her to put herself in her daughter's shoes. If your parent had married that child's parent, would she have been able to instantly forgive and forget, and bond with that child as if they were siblings?\n\nFor that matter, imagine if a coworker she can't stand were to move into her home.

It could greatly improve Ruby's life to figure out the reasons behind her actions. It will hopefully mitigate the bully issue and these relationships can start to heal themselves without force.", "Ruby isn't having a rough time in school. She's running a one girl terror campaign.  The other kids aren't going to bond with her or be able to stop her. What's going to be more likely is Zoe is going to get blamed for Ruby's behavior as her \"sister.\" Be prepared for your niece basically moving in with you. \n\n>My sister remarried 4 months after introducing them to everyone.\n\nThat was a mistake by itself. Your sister is a massive asshole. How long did you basically raise her kid? Did she even talk to Zoe about any of this? You should not have your sister's back here.

I'm not sure of exactly how long this goes back exactly but my kids have mentioned incidents since 1st grade", "Yes and I started hearing about these incidents when they were all in first grade, but it could be going on longer than that even.", "I'm not sure about Ruby's father but I know my sister doesn't have the relationship with Ruby to have that kind of talk with her.", "They might never want to be her friend. The vibe I get from Zoe is she will never be truly happy about it and I can see she resents her mom/my sister for marrying Ruby's dad and making Ruby family. But she also lives with her. Cole at least doesn't have to see Ruby as much. I know that makes it easier for him to... he's not okay with it, he doesn't like the fact or want it to be true, but it's not as tough for him as it is for Zoe. Honestly she wants to never be at my sister's house. She even talked about wishing she could go to a different school. I can't blame her for that. Ruby is still treating kids that way today and as far as I can see there is no real action being taken about that. Maybe there is and I'm simply not aware of it. But I have a bad feeling this is going to bubble over in a few years.", "This stuff doesn't happen in my sister's house. It normally happens at our parents or sometimes mine. When we're all together. My son doesn't really go to my sister's house, never did, but now he doesn't want to because it would mean seeing Ruby and Zoe does what she can to see Ruby as little as possible (doesn't help that they're all in the same class and so Ruby and Zoe are around each other a lot).", "I'm sorry but can we move past the \"she is a bully because she is troubled so everyone should make amends for her\" bs?? No, she is a bully because she is spoiled and her parents weren't able to properly raise her. That doesn't mean that her victims have to put up with it. And it definitely doesn't mean their parents should force their kids to accept their bully. They shun her because she is meam to them. Why does op has to spend time with a child who bullies her child?? The \"she is a kid\" excuse is bs. So are op's son and niece.", "By", "That's a shame. For all the kids involved really, but the kids clearly aren't comfortable around her and you're right not to try and force that bond. Hopefully your sister and her husband can manage the situation appropriately. If they can't then it's good your niece has a trusted adult she can talk to. \n\nBest of luck", "Yeah, you're right. It might never improve. Ruby might never improve, or Ruby might improve but too late for it to make a difference to Zoe or Cole. They might fight like cats and dogs until one of them moves out. They might have forgotten they ever hated each other by the time they're 15. It is impossible to know with kids this young.\n\nBut regardless of what happens, none of the adults involved can do anything about those feelings. You can and should correct behaviours. You can and should have open and honest conversations with all three about their feelings on a regular basis. You of course can and should support each of their individual needs, including your sister and her husband seeking therapy for Ruby. But even with all of that, their relationship at the end of the day is going to be whatever it's going to be :/"]}
