My niece is Zoe and my son is Cole. Zoe and Cole are very close. Zoe's dad was my childhood best friend. He and my sister got married a couple of years before Zoe was born and he died when she was 4 weeks old. After that my sister needed help so I had Zoe with me during the day because I was home while my boyfriend at the time, and now husband, worked. So Cole and Zoe have grown up very close and are like siblings more than cousins.\n\nThe name Ruby has been brought up a few times over the years. Cole told me Ruby was really mean to one of the kids in his friend group. Another time I heard from Cole and Zoe that Ruby got into trouble for pouring water over a bunch of kids lunches, including theirs. Another time she made fun of a child who started wearing glasses and didn't get cool ones but more bulky ones because the parents couldn't afford something more stylish and how she made her cry until she puked. There were other times her name was brought up as well. About 2 years ago my sister mentioned she was dating someone and said she didn't know if it was serious or not. Then a year ago she introduced him to everyone and his daughter, Ruby. My sister remarried 4 months after introducing them to everyone. Zoe and Cole were not happy. Ruby wasn't happy either but wasn't saying anything to me about it directly.\n\nMy sister was aware of the issues with Ruby and the fact there were some long standing bad feelings there. She was not deterred by this and instead she tried to pretend they were all new to each other and attempted to get Zoe and Cole to include Ruby in their play, and for them to be the three musketeers instead of two peas in a pod. Zoe told her mom it was never going to happen and that Ruby doesn't belong in the family. She got punished harshly for that. Cole told my sister he didn't like Ruby and just because she was Ruby's stepmom now, it didn't change anything. My sister looked for me to back her up and tell him it changed everything but I did not. She told me I should have had her back.\n\nA few days went by and then she told me we needed to talk and said I needed to support getting the kids to bond together and give Ruby a chance because she has no extended family and she's having a rough time in school. I asked my sister what she meant by that. She was reluctant to say. I asked if her husband was getting calls about how Ruby treats other kids. She didn't deny it. I told her she can't erase what Zoe and Cole think of Ruby and she needs to accept that. That Ruby has not proven to be a friend to them and they have more history with her being mean to others than they do with her being her stepdaughter.\n\nShe said they're 10 and have so much more room to grow. I told her this is true, but you can't ask people to like someone who is mean to them and their friends. My sister said I am being too hard on Ruby and I'm an AH for defending Ruby being excluded.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1682414121, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12ydt23/aita_for_telling_my_sister_she_cant_erase_what/", "score": 3600, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You forcing them makes you a bully too, and I will not tolerate anyone who forces my children to engage in behaviours or situations that make them uncomfortable. That's a dangerous precedent to set for many reasons. End of story. Your sister is T A. You are NTA", "NTA. That kid is obviously mean as F and I'm actually a bit taken aback, that your sister is trying to downplay that. You should never force kids to \"like\" or include someone who clearly bullied them and their friends and I'm actually questioning your sisters intelligence for acting like that.", "So your sister married the father of her and your kid\u2019s bully?

Your sister needs to listen a bit more to her daughter. It's good she's trying to include her stepdaughter but she would be better putting that energy into getting help for the very obvious bully nature this girl has. The girl has serious issues from the way it sounds and that's a larger problem then the kids not being open to trusting her right now.\n\nGood luck", "NTA. At her age it's really not Ruby's fault but her parents need to actively address her behavioral issues. I know this sub is full of 'go to therapy' suggestions but if it's a possibility to get Ruby some professional help then I don't think that's a bad idea. Based on my experience she does seem to be quite young to be getting into all this trouble.", "NTA at all. In any situation that involves step family, you can't force a connection. There's no law that says step siblings have to have a relationship. They need to treat each other with respect, sure. But they don't have to be buddies.", "NTA. Ruby is part of Zoe and Cole\u2019s blended family now. That\u2019s okay. At the same time, they already had a relationship. Not a good one. It would be nice for Ruby if her bad actions didn\u2019t have consequences. But that\u2019s not how the works works. It\u2019s not how Zoe and Cole work, and forcing them to pretend otherwise would send a terrible message to them. The appropriate message is \u201cRuby\u2019s now part of the family\u201d. I\u2019m not sure exactly what that changes - it probably means that Ruby will be present at more family events, perhaps even on a day to day basis. Maybe it means her behavior towards her new family members will change - time will tell. Until then, taking Zoe, Cole or Ruby that they have to feel differently is a terrible message. Their feelings are valid, and the reality of modern blended families is that not everyone likes everyone, and that\u2019s okay.", "NTA. She seems to want her own daughter Zoe and her nephew Cole to do all the attitude readjustment and \u2018grow\u2019.  Are she and Ruby\u2019s father having some serious come to Jesus sessions with Ruby about her behavior?", "NTA\n\nKids don't tend to be awful without a reason, so it's likely that Ruby was really struggling at home and didn't have the right supports and emotional outlets, so she acted out. Especially at the age you first heard about it, but even at 10, I can't really blame this on Ruby. She certainly has plenty of room to grow and change and become a perfectly lovely person.\n\nAt the same time, the other two have had nothing but bad experiences with her, and that doesn't magically go away because she's family now. They *do* need to understand that she's family, that she has just as much of a right to be in the family as they do, and that she's not going anywhere. They *don't* have to like it or to be her friend right away. Hopefully as they all grow up and Ruby recovers, they'll form a closer bond, but you can't force a bond on kids. If you try to force it, all you'll build is their resentment.", "NTA. Ruby is a bully. She is young enough to change but how can that happen if nobody does anything about it.

This one girl started coming in - which was totally fine, we were open to the public - but she was pretty immediately a massive pain and unpleasant to deal with. Talking loudly through shows and movies (including spoilers if she'd seen it already) while the lights were down and everyone else quiet, getting loudly annoyed that other people played boardgames she wasn't interested in, butting into conversations solely to argue or say someone was wrong (when they weren't, and even if you pulled out proof on your phone or something she'd reject it), only ever disagreeing and arguing about where to get food from when someone went out to pick up a group order and refusing to compromise, putting down other people (clothes, hobbies, interests), and somehow steering *every conversation* into her historical fanfiction where she was friends with Ben Franklin and they time travelled together, and which she spoke about like it was real (\"oh, that's just like when Ben and I-\" \"that reminds me of when Ben-\") This meant none of us bonded with her, and we stopped engaging, though we had a basic charter (required for all student groups), which included rules and how we were to deal with violations. We'd been trying to be nice at first, thinking she might just be neurodivergent or something, but after months of dealing with her, it was apparent she was just TERRIBLE at socializing and was extremely inconsiderate. She started getting warnings, including being told that after 3 violations in a month she could be banned from the room for the quarter. 3 warnings was a violation, and warnings were things like \"don't tell everyone spoilers on this brand new episode of the show we're watching as a group and all waited to watch together\", so it took a LOT to get kicked out. You were told when a warning counted towards a violation, and would be shown the rules if you asked for it. All of the rules were basic politeness, like cleaning up after yourself, not leaving food in the room, that sort of thing.\n\nOne day a new girl came in while we were watching a movie. PITA instantly glommed onto her since the rest of us had no interest in sitting with her. Newbie looked around and *quietly* asked why PITA was sitting waaaaaay on the other side of the room alone. The LOUD repy was \"oh, that's cuz the rest of these guys are jerks who don't want to be friends with me.\" She then launched into a full-volume conversation - asking newbie if she'd ever heard of historical fanfiction. Our pres stood up, paused the movie, and turned on the lights. Another member spoke up; \"serious question - if you know you're not friends with any of us after *months* of coming in here, why do you still come in here every week?\" She burst into tears, jumped up, and literally ran from the room. We apologized to the new girl for the scene and indicated there were seats and snacks closer to the big screen if she wanted to move up, and she did. She was fine, and became a regular attendee.\n\nBy the end of the week, everyone was called into the student life office to talk to the director in charge of all the various groups. We were told that PITA's mom had come in and raised a big scene, shouting and threatening to sue, saying her daughter was being bullied and unfairly excluded. We presented our (approved when we formed) charter, as well as the notebook where we recorded warnings and behavior issues, including MONTHS of 'soft warnings' where we'd not counted things against PITA in the hopes she'd get better, but still informed her she was breaking etiquette and rules. The director was relieved and said we had handled everything perfectly, we'd done nothing wrong, and if she came back we were perfectly in our rights to ban her entirely - including that we could call on security to remove her if she showed up and was being obstructive.\n\nThe following week, she swaggered in, interrupting the show we'd put on, and pres quickly and quietly paused it and turned on the lights again. She looked around at us smugly, and said \"my *mom* spoke to the director and now you *have* to let me be in here, so that means *I* **won.**\" When the response was rolled eyes, smirks, and being ignored, she was baffled. VP gently took her aside and explained that no, we had no obligation to include her, and that while we'd been willing as a group to give her a chance, the way she'd just reentered was intentionally bad-spirited and a definite rule-break, so besides having the director's go-ahead, by the club's charter she was out for the quarter and we could have her removed by security.\n\nShe grabbed up her bag, *shrieked*, and fled the room again. For the next couple weeks she sat in a booth near our meeting room, and would loudly accost people (to no effect, and if anything drawing people in) saying we were all bullies and rude.\n\nI eventually went out to her and asked what she thought she was accomplishing. I asked if this was what made her happy; why she preferred harassing people she wasn't friends with over hanging out with her real friends. She didn't have a response. I asked if she thought this was how you make friends or look like someone who's fun to be around and be friends with. She shook her head. I asked if her mom had ever 'talked to the school' while she was growing up to 'make other kids play nice,' and she admitted, yeah, it had happened a few times, including getting other kids moved out of classes or working with her when they didn't want to.\n\n\"Well, we're adults now. Mom can't force other adults to be your friends. If you don't get along with other people, the normal thing to do is move on, or do some introspection and figure out what *you* are doing that doesn't mesh - and if you can't or don't want to change, you accept that you're not compatible and move on anyway. You've been out here every week just to tell other people not to check us out, and it's not even working. It's not healthy. Care about yourself more than to waste time on people who aren't your friends. There's a writing club, have you checked them out?\"\n\nShe was quiet for a minute before saying she went a couple times but people didn't like her critiques, so she stopped going. \"But you weren't kicked out or anything?\" Head shake no. \"Well, maybe go back and try to be nicer or something?\" Continued chatting for a bit, and it was painful. It was obvious she was mom's perfect angel, and everyone else could either suck it up or get out of her way... until now.\n\nShe stayed out there a while longer after I went back in the room, but after that we didn't see her around except incidentally on campus, and she just avoided us.\n\nI ran into her at a store years later where she was working as a cashier, and she was extremely polite but wouldn't make eye contact. I pretended I had no idea who she was.

You said Ruby's behaviours won't change overnight, which is accurate of course, but they aren't even pretending to address these behaviours. They will NEVER change if they are not addressed. It is not a matter of waiting it out.\n\nWhy would OP meet them in the middle when they are not willing to do the same? What the sister is suggesting is forcing the children to behave how she wants them to, without regard for their actual circumstances. To spend time with someone actively bullying their friends, and who has actively bullied them in the past, without so much as an apology OR adjustment to her behaviour. The child isn't the problem, the parents are. OP's sister and her husband need to look at why Ruby is behaving like this and get her help. Forcing children to take the brunt of the bullying would help Ruby, how exactly? Mean people (even children) should not get designated practice dummies to learn to behave. especially if they have no interest in changing.\n\nI can understand your point and I think it would be very very different if Ruby's parents were actively addressing her bullying behaviours and understanding their children's perspectives, but they are not. They are failing Ruby by trying to force friendships rather than teach her how to earn them.", "There's no evidence that she has changed at all, though, and I don't know where you're getting that from.  \n\nSure, if Ruby was actively in therapy and starting to realize that her awful behavior is the reason she has no friends, that would be one thing.... but according to OP's sister they're still getting calls from the school about her bullying other kids, and they're still pretending that the only thing she needs is for her stepsibling to be forced to like her.  \n\nSo with no indication that she has changed, and a complete rejection of the idea that Ruby has any issues at all, your suggestion is that OP force her child and her niece to just accept Ruby's abuse until the magical day she wakes up and doesn't want to be a bully anymore? If the parents don't want to do anything about Ruby's behavior, nothing will change unless she gets a wakeup call from the kids at school standing up to her.", "Many years ago when my oldest was in middle school, there was this bully that liked to trip and push people in the hall. He pushed my son one day and caused his glasses to fall and get damaged. I came to bring him his extra pair and see if the other pair could be fixed. They couldn't, so they made a new pair. The pair that was damaged had all the bells & whistles that you used to have to pay extra for- polycarbonate lenses, Crizal anti-glare, Transitions UV blockers and scratch resistant coating. All together it was about $400 for the new pair.\n\n I took the bill to the school and asked the principal if the school or the kids parents were going to pay for the replacement. He sputtered, trying to say it was just an accident and the parents or school shouldn't have to pay so I told him that I was going to file a report and the possible charges would include  assault & battery since my kid was pushed & fell down, criminal mischief/damage to property for the cost of the glasses and he should make himself available because my attorney would be calling him. \n\nI guess he thought I was bluffing but when my attorney called the school and school board, I was told I could come pick up a check for the cost of the glasses and to notify me that the student had been expelled and would attend alternative school for the rest of the year.", "And let's not forget the amount of damage done to the bullied kids in the meantime. Whether Ruby gets in serious trouble for it later or not, that kind of severe bullying can have lifelong repercussions for someone's mental health. Ask me how I know. The dad needs to get this kid under control before she winds up driving someone into actions that may have lifelong consequences.", "Sounds like the kid has all sorts of unaddressed trauma and instead of addressing it sister wants to ignore it.", "Which behaviors, specifically? Is she still bullying Cole and Zoe? Has she been asked to apologize and refused?\n\nTo me, the \"even then, they should be able to say no given what has happened\" is where you're wrong. It's reasonable to ask for some evidence of progress before you back your sister up. It is unreasonable to say that you would support your son never forgiving his step-cousin for things that happened in elementary school.", "OP said she doesn't know how they are addressing the bullying behaviors\u2014it sounds like the sister has had calls with the school and is trying to figure that out.  So I don't think it's fair to say that the sister and father \"aren't even pretending to address these behaviours.\" They are. For example, based on the response to my comment, it doesn't sound like Ruby is actively mean to Cole and Zoe anymore. Small steps for sure, but that is progress.\n\nAnd, maybe I missed it in some comment, but we don't know that sister hasn't asked Ruby to apologize for past behaviors or tried to get Ruby help. That's not in the post. And we certainly don't have OP suggesting that the sister try to get Ruby help and *then* she'd back her up when they saw some progress. My vote would flip if that were the case because that would be a reasonable ask. OP's post reads like a closed door, and if the kids don't want to ever forgive her or include her despite her making progress, so be it. And her last response to me confirmed that: she said even if Ruby made progress in rehabilitating herself, she would support Cole saying no to including her. i just find that too harsh.", "We have no evidence to the contrary.  OPs comment does not say but she doesn't say...\"If Ruby doesn't change,\" she said Rudy should be ignored.  I am opposed to assuming the child has no hope.  OPs answer was black and white.", "She is still actively mean to other kids in school. One of the more recent incidents (as in this year) is she called one of Cole and Zoe's friends the R word (you know one used to insult intelligence). Another more recent incident is she accused a kid of wetting herself in class and laughing.", "That might be true, but if it is the case, I think the sister has an obligation to discuss how they're moving forward and not just shut down the conversation. OP is not just the aunt here, she also has a child that has been mistreated by Ruby, and is still subject to watching her bully others, even if the bullying towards Zoe and Cole has stopped. Ruby no longer being mean to those two specifically doesn't indicate to me at all that she's gotten help or that her bullying is being addressed, especially if the parents are still receiving calls from the school. It might just mean that she's smart enough not to do it to her new family, or it might mean that she's beginning to come around. There's no way for us to know, or for OP to know if the sister refuses to engage honestly about the situation. \n\nOP wrote, \"\\[OP's sister said\\] she's having a rough time in school. I asked my sister what she meant by that. She was reluctant to say. I asked if her husband was getting calls about how Ruby treats other kids. She didn't deny it.\" It's true that this isn't completely rejecting the conversation, but she certainly isn't open to discussing the reality of the situation. If the sister wants OP to have faith that Ruby will behave differently, she needs to be willing to discuss it. I agree that a completely closed door is unfair; Ruby is ten, and for everyone's sake she will hopefully get better. I do not think that Ruby is the problem here. But that doesn't make it right to force her on children she has previously hurt, especially when she is still hurting their friends (as OP posted in another comment). \n\nIf the sister and Ruby's dad are addressing things, great! Based on this post, they seem to be deflecting when directly asked but of course we have no way of knowing. But they cannot ignore OP's rightful concerns and refuse to discuss them.", "you\u2019re right about that, and i don\u2019t know if i\u2019m just super jaded at this point but i can\u2019t think of that many people i grew up with who didn\u2019t have differing levels of this dynamic at home. i definitely grew into a person who refused to even consider having kids because i couldn\u2019t guarantee that i wasn\u2019t setting up someone else for the same fate down the road", "Okay, so name-calling, bad words, and teasing. She needs to improve, but these aren't exactly irredeemable, unforgivable qualities when the kid is 10, such that you should feel fine telling your son that he never has to forgive his step-cousin if she does manage to turn it around.\n\nWhat about my other questions? Is she still mean to Cole and Zoe? Has she been asked to apologize to them and refused?", "Yeah, I'm just skeptical they are deflecting or not trying to address the concerns based on OP's responses. I didn't read it as the sister refusing to discuss, I read it as the sister asking OP to back her up, and OP just saying no. One thing that's really hard about these posts is that OPs often leave out pretty important information, which this OP did, such as the fact that Ruby lost her mother at a young age. And the quote you copied also set off flags for me because it sis so vague -- why is sister so reluctant to discuss the specifics of the calls with OP? Maybe to respect Ruby's privacy\u2013it doesn't say whether these are calls from the school or other parents. Or maybe because OP has already set her mind that Ruby is an irredeemable problem child, so her sister doesn't feel comfortable confiding in her anymore. \n\nOP hasn't said what concerns are being ignored or explained what could be done before she'd back the sister up in trying to include Ruby. For example, she indicated in her last response that she has not even asked whether Ruby has been asked to apologize to Cole/Zoe. She doesn't *care* what steps sister is taking. As far as she's concerned, if the kids say Ruby is the black sheep, she is, and that's that.\n\nI think we probably have a similar point of view, actually, but are just reaching different conclusions about what's actually going on based on the post. The one thing that is clear is that OP has said that even if Ruby turns it around, she will support her kid in continuing to exclude her. To me, that's what makes her TA. And I don't say E-S-H because I don't think we have enough info to conclude that the sister isn't asking for something reasonable.", "She is mean to the general group still not Cole and Zoe individually, that I am aware of. She also has spoiled some more lunches still. She has not been asked to apologize to them that I am aware of and she has not apologized to them. Cole and Zoe were never her main or primary targets though. They were always just some of them. And she has added new targets in more recent times as well.", "I do not believe in forcing people to have close relationships with others. My son has known this girl since he was 6 and he has witnessed and been the subject of mean things said and done to him. He has watched one of his closest friends be called many names over many years. That is something that impacts kids and changes their relationships. My son will not be forced to be friends with Ruby if she changes. I will support him regardless because he is my priority. I am his mother. If I don't have his back then who will? I am not saying Ruby is irredeemable at all. But actions have consequences and bullies are not always going to be welcomed by the targets of their bully or the friends of their victims.\n\nI know for a fact that Ruby has never apologized. I did not ask my sister if she was Ruby was asked to because I do not believe that will change anything because the fact is she has not.\n\nI actually had a lot more details in my post originally and it was too long to get posted. I am doing my best to answer questions being asked. But many things were cut, including other incidents and the fact Ruby's mother died and the fact she was a baby or toddler when she died and not in her life before her death.", "NAH.

The people that bullied her, abused her, made her feel like less of a human, YOU have sympathy for THEM??? \n\nYou might claim to be \"stronger than a weak ass bully on the internet\", but you're not strong enough to defend your child. You go so far as to side with the people that destroyed her childhood. That forced your daughter to want to move away from her hometown.\n\nType away at your keyboard, safe behind your screen,  pretending you're not the weakling that couldn't protect the ONE person you're supposed to. \n\nNow go grab your inhaler before you over exert yourself.", "Red flags all over. First, kids who bully others are often bullied at home, though that\u2019s not the only reason. I would look askance at marrying into the family of a notorious bully. Zoe must have told her mother what Ruby was like at school. That alone meant her mother should not have gone on a first date with Ruby\u2019s father, let alone marry him. \n\nSecond, when people remarry, THEY choose their new spouse. Not the kids. Feelings cannot be forced. Only basic civility can be enforced. You cannot make a person you dated love you, and you can\u2019t make children love step parents or step siblings. \n\nFinally, it appears as though your sister is not prioritizing her daughter\u2019s feelings. She\u2019s blowing her off because she wants to start a fantastic new life with a new man. Well, bully for her, but forcing her daughter to live with a girl who\u2019s treated her badly is not the way to do it. \n\nRuby needs counseling to see what\u2019s wrong. I pray it\u2019s a solvable problem, because God help Cole and Zoe if Ruby is antisocial or a psychopath, or if the source of the problem is the father\u2019s mistreatment. \n\nI\u2019m glad Zoe has you. May your home be a refuge.", "NTA.\n\nYour now BIL and his ex failed to parent their daughter and she became a bully. That's on them. If your sister has chosen to pretend that Ruby doesn't have issues and that the experiences the kids have had with her don't exist, there's nothing you can do about that. You can protect your child, and you never have to back her up in her happy family delusion.", "NTA. It doesn't matter the age, you can't force people to like each other or be friends. At this point, Zoe and Cole KNOW Ruby is a mean little girl and she has been for years. Maybe if your sister was more focused on getting Ruby to not be a bully she would have friends and extended family. Until that happens, NO ONE has to accept her behavior because \"ShE'S FaMiLY\"", "Nta", "NTA. It\u2019s hard enough to adjust and accept a new stepsibling after 4 months of your parent dating. That\u2019s a new person you know nothing about. Inviting your school bully into your house and \u201cmaking them family\u201d will only end in disaster. Has Ruby\u2019s bullying ways stopped? Nope, they just want to sweep her issues under the rug.", "NTA, I hope your sister realizes that if she keeps trying to push Ruby onto her daughter and your son, her daughter will spend even less time at home because she won't feel comfortable. 10 year olds are able to know when things don't work. They only see a bully and will only see a bully. Maybe if Ruby stopped bullying other kids it would be different. I would tell your sister to watch the Pixar short Lou and then have the kids watch it. Of course I would tell you as a parent to watch it too before you tell your sister to watch it..Playground Bully gets taught a lesson by a Frankenstein monster of lost and found objects", "NTA she shouldn\u2019t have married and made her sons bully his stepsister. She\u2019s ridiculous!", "NTA, Ruby needs to get into therapy, or she will end up in a school for troubled or problem students.  The other kids will come around once she starts to behave and stop acting out.", "NTA. Protect your son and niece!!", "NTA\n\nRuby is a bully. Her father needs to put her in therapy and your sister needs to stop trying to force her victims to pretend she isn\u2019t a bully. \n\nMaybe the apple hasn\u2019t fallen far from the tree and maybe Ruby\u2019s father is also a vicious bully and that was what your sister liked about him?", "NTA", "NTA\n\nHowever I am concerned for Zoe who actually has to live with a bully, a mother who punishes her for natural feelings and a step father who is almost certainly going to favor his bio daughter's interests.\n\nThings are going to be awful for Zoe in that house - a divorce situation would be easier because at least she would have a safe home for 50% of the time.", "You can\u2019t possibly know that lol", "YES. This is what I was thinking - the sister knew that Ruby was bullying her own child and she chose to marry the parent anyway? That's low. \n\nNTA and I'm glad that Cole and Zoe have their aunt.  I imagine they'll both need somewhere safe to stay when they're older and can't stand living at home any more.", "N T A. They don't like Ruby for obvious reasons, but also they don't trust her. Your sister needs to watch how she tries to push the issue, or they won't trust her either.", "Ohh no the bully is having a a hard time? Tell your sister to kick rocks. NTA. Prepare for the day Zoe is old enough to ask you if she can move in. Your sister ahas already shown she\u2019s going to put herself/ ruby before her own daughter.", "NTA.\n\nYour sister needs to get Ruby to work on herself and her behavior, hopefully with professional help. Maybe if she demonstrates changed behavior in the longterm, your son and daughter MIGHT learn to tolerate her, but they don't owe her anything, attention or otherwise. She's been a bully and she's reaping the consequences of that. It's on her. Forcing her on your son and Zoe is only going to breed further resentment. Your sister needs to get a healthy dose of reality and see things as they are, not as the fantasy world she wants to live in.", "NTA. Your husband is addicted to media. Now, as someone who also is, I am at least able to \"turn it off\" when asked and when it's important to do so. My fiance, she also enjoys watching some shows. So what we do is we have a TV in the living room and the bedroom. \n\nNow I know you say you don't want this due to him watching TV. But my fiance and I take turns using either TV when one wants to watch something the other does not. The difference being when I goto bed, I absolutely do not need the TV on. And if she is watching TV when we goto bed. I can sleep as TV doesn't bother me. Sometimes I'll just watch what she is watching cuz I can enjoy virtually anything as far as TV or movies go.\n\nI get we are an exception to the rule. However, you may want to try it. If he has the living room and you have the bedroom, you can both do your thing. Your husband seems as though he really does consume a lot of media and it's only fair you can too. Tell him the bedroom TV is only for use when the other TV is also in use. Hopefully he can abide by this so when you both go to sleep, that's exactly what you experience, sleep.", "Sounds like Ruby has a lot of growing to do! And your sister too, as a parent \n\nLol\n\nNTA", "NTA\nA bit you may want to share with your sister: these are KIDS we're talking about here.  You can't wave the marriage wand and (poof) make everything better.  Maybe in a year or so they'll grow out of behaviors, but it's not something you can expect in a split second.", "NTA, Ruby's dad need to deal with her as she has issues that can't seem to handle. She probably needs therapy. You can't force her into a group who hates her because of all the things she had done.", "No one one is really TA here. \n\nI\u2019d suggest your sister organize activities with the kids, her & husband. \nNothing too structured but something that allows them to get to know each other. \n\nSit em all down and talk through it. \n\nNothing is a better replacement for parenting than being there", "NTA and your sister is BEYOND clueless.  r.", "This happens too often when the parents try to shove stepkids down each other's throats and favor the stepkids. The parents are so selfish to believe that, because they love each other, everyone will love each other and will punish them until they do. No loyalty to their own kids in favor of their love life. NTA", "It\u2019s a shame that your sister doesn\u2019t realize that things cannot even begin to heal until Ruby\u2019s terrible treatment of others stops.", "Someone needs to take Ruby to therapy and behavior classes. Ruby is mad about something. Passing her into a family did not help.", "NTA, especially if they are just focusing on forcing Cole and Zoe to make room for Ruby. Ruby needs to stop being a bully and show signs of change to start earning forgiveness. Honestly, your sister shouldn\u2019t have married and brought them into the home of things with Zoe and Ruby were this bad. It was irresponsible to not think about how the kids\u2019 relationship would play out.", "So, basically, your sister KNEW that this little brat had been tormenting her own child, her nephew, and their friends.......and essentially told the kids, \"sucks to be you, because MY happiness is more important.\"     \nThat'll end well.\ud83d\ude44", "NTA\n\nOF ALL THE FISH she chose Ruby\u2019s father?\n\nEight years down the road is gonna be shocked Pikachu face and why is my daughter moving in with my sister? Maybe even soon\u2014it\u2019ll be like why is my daughter asking my sister to try and find a way to get custody of her\n\nI bet this is how it actually went down. She was called into the office to have a discussion about Ruby bullying her daughter. She met a guy she thought was hot and decided her daughter\u2019s not important anymore. And so instead of being a proactive mother and caring mother, she\u2019s been ignoring the bullying of her daughter.\n\nI\u2019m just going to comment in general to put into the Reddit ether, I don\u2019t know why parents keep doing this to their children. It\u2019s not your fault. Obviously your sister has issues that she needs to sort out on her own. But I really don\u2019t understand why parents love life/sex life are more important than the well-being of their child. I will accept that children can\u2019t dictate 100% of their parents\u2019 lives. Like if you have to move for a job, you have to move for a job to provide for the child. But why get involved with people that just don\u2019t click with your children. There are mixed families were stepchildren respect their step parent, but don\u2019t necessarily love them. They can cohabitated have a positive working but maybe superficial relationship. I don\u2019t know why people have to do this and find the worst family mix to push on their poor kids. Like is it really that hard?", "They do have a lot of room to grow.\n, and you all have to make an effort, or else that kid will be scarred for a long time\u2026 she needs to know that she has to be kind to family, even step- and -in-law, and the other kids have to be friendly towards her. \n\nGet to know her, and see what she\u2019s like.", "Then she shouldn't have married the father yet", "NTA\n\nMore likely, if your sister does cut you out of Zoe's life and tries to force a sibling relationship with Ruby, she's going to come crying to you when Zoe is over 18 and goes LC/NC with her mother. \n\nShe seems to have rushed into her new relationship with no realistic expectations. If she doesn't smarten up, she will lose her own daughter. Will her new husband and Ruby be enough to fill that void.", "You\u2019re amazing. I wish every kid had a mama like you.", "I\u2019ve mostly gotten over what I was put through and I\u2019m thriving now, but there\u2019s at least one person from high school that if they tried being buddy buddy with me nowadays, I\u2019d tell them to fuck off. I still remember the horrible and cruel things that were said to me, that stuff fucks up your self esteem.", "I think there are a few things to unload from this. \n\n First I just want to start by saying that you are not the AH. Your sister on the other hand needs to be more understanding of her own child\u2019s feelings and concerns towards their new \u201csibling.\u201d That is a huge adjustment for any 10-year-old to have make in such a short amount of time, I mean she only gave her daughter four months to mentally prepare for such a huge life change? I can only imagine how that must feel for her, and will more than likely cause some serious resentment down the road if it hasn\u2019t already. \n\n Also a huge red flag that pops up for me, is why does Ruby have the behavioral issues that she has? 10-year-olds aren\u2019t inherently monsters, something is making/ has made her act out this way. It makes me wonder who your sister married in the first place, and if she vetted his character before bringing him and his child into her and her child\u2019s life. Obviously it may not be the dads fault that she is acting this way, but you can\u2019t help but wonder why nothing has been done to help this little girl deal with her emotions. The whole situation just leaves a pit feeling in my stomach, but maybe I\u2019m just paranoid. Either way I hope Ruby gets the help she so desperately needs, and I hope your sister opens her eyes to the situation she is putting her own child in.", "NTA your sister is enabling that girl\u2019s behavior she will only get worse as she gets older. Also the higher up in education the more likely she\u2019ll be suspended for bullying or expelled a lot of schools are strict on that because all it takes is the victims parents to threaten a lawsuit against the district. That girl is going to have zero friends her whole life because no one wants to correct her. She\u2019s also going to be entitled thinking everyone should bow to her and that\u2019s not how the world works.", "NTA and you are correct in your teasoning. Those kids are never going to \u201cbond.\u201d", "**NTA you\u2019re sisters delusional for more reasons than one**.\n\nFirstly ruby doesn\u2019t have a \u201ctough time at school\u201d ruby **gives kids a hard time at school**. She\u2019s a bully, those kids will never stand a chance so long as your sister and BIL refuse to put her in therapy and give her some serious consequences. They\u2019re coddling her which is only enabling her behavior. **She can feel bad for her sure but she can\u2019t pretend her atrocious behavior doesn\u2019t exist and isn\u2019t the sole reason the kids aren\u2019t bonding**. Second you \u201cbacking her up\u201d won\u2019t do shit, you could beat your sons ass blue trying to force him to hangout with ruby and he\u2019s still never going to see her as more than a bully until she gets the serious help she needs. \n\nCole and Zoe have also grown up together, even if ruby was a sweet well adjusted kid she\u2019s never going to share the bond they do. They may all become friendly maybe even sisterly if ruby changes, but to the level the two of them are is never going to happen. **Lastly she\u2019s going about wanting them to bond the wrong way, the more to force something or someone on a kid the more they push back**. I get it your sister wants to move on, she wants the white picket fence little \u201cfamily\u201d but she\u2019s never going to have that. Blended families while still families are 20x more complex, there\u2019s different extended families, different traumas related their other parent, etc. \n\n**Shes not only not going to get what she wants by trying to force Zoe, but she\u2019s sure as hell going to make her resent her; hell she might even go no contact with her when she\u2019s old enough.** My parents are divorced I\u2019ve got through 1 SM, and 3 SD\u2019s and I hated 3 of them, not because they were shitty people but because it was blatantly obvious they were trying to hard to take my dads place, my mom also had her head so far up her ass she prioritized her fantasy of a family over my needs as her daughter. The only way bonds form with step parents or siblings is if they do it at their own pace, or they\u2019re introduced extremely young (barely forming memories young). \n\nThe fact she\u2019s punishing her for sharing her feelings and speaking her truth makes this so much worse, it\u2019s like she\u2019s actively trying to make her daughter hate her and ruby. Ultimately though **she\u2019s probably going to have to learn that the hard way, people like your sister never listen to reason. They only care about what they want and fuck what it takes to get there or who it hurts because only their feelings and their needs count. She\u2019s going to wake up 20 years from now and wonder why her daughter refuses to pick up her calls, or why she\u2019s not invited to her daughters wedding, then another 20 after that when she can\u2019t wipe her own ass or change her own sheets: she\u2019s going to wonder why her daughter would rather put her in a 2 star nursing home than have her living under her roof**. \n\n**Unfortunately there\u2019s not much you can do to protect her from that future. The only thing you can do is give Zoe a safe place to vent, and share her feelings.\nShe needs that now more than ever, as far as your son just keep doing what you\u2019re doing. You\u2019re under no obligation to make your son uncomfortable to pander to her delusions. You can\u2019t stop her from doing it to Zoe but you sure as hell can stop her from doing it to Cole**. She\u2019s just mad her daughters a living human with logic and feelings and refuses to say how high when her mom tells her to jump. I honestly pray Zoe finds her way out of her moms grasp, sooner rather than later**. \n\n**ETA : This might be far ahead and I know you hope your sister wakes up: but you need to be prepared for the day Zoe asks you to come live with you because she can\u2019t stay there anymore. You need to plan for it op, you\u2019re the only person in her life that\u2019s thinking about her.**.", "NTA. Sure, a 10 year old bully can reform but it's entirely their victims' decision whether to forgive them even if they do reform.", "NTA but do monitor the situation. If Ruby's behavior improves ASK (do not tell) Zoe and Cole if they are willing to give her a chance to show that she's changed. \n\nYour sister needs to talk to her new husband about getting Ruby some professional help though. If she's been the class bully for 5 years she may not be able to make any friends at all.", "I was the one kid at church who tried being friends with the mean girl in my grade. That girl was a scourge on my life and almost no one, including the adults, listened to me about how much of a demon spawn she was. Even years later into adulthood she was pulling the same insidious shit and my friends at the church still wouldn\u2019t listen until they were finally affected by it. I was always nice to the mean kids growing up and finally stopped in college. It felt good once I did. That kid having no friends is not your kid\u2019s problem at all and good on you for standing up to that bullshit. I\u2019m glad my parents did too, just wish I\u2019d listened a lot sooner. Sorry for the rant, it just triggered a lot of unhappy memories ha. Your kids are going to do great in life, keep reminding them they don\u2019t have to interact with bullies. They can be kind from a distance."]}
