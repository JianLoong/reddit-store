My niece is Zoe and my son is Cole. Zoe and Cole are very close. Zoe's dad was my childhood best friend. He and my sister got married a couple of years before Zoe was born and he died when she was 4 weeks old. After that my sister needed help so I had Zoe with me during the day because I was home while my boyfriend at the time, and now husband, worked. So Cole and Zoe have grown up very close and are like siblings more than cousins.\n\nThe name Ruby has been brought up a few times over the years. Cole told me Ruby was really mean to one of the kids in his friend group. Another time I heard from Cole and Zoe that Ruby got into trouble for pouring water over a bunch of kids lunches, including theirs. Another time she made fun of a child who started wearing glasses and didn't get cool ones but more bulky ones because the parents couldn't afford something more stylish and how she made her cry until she puked. There were other times her name was brought up as well. About 2 years ago my sister mentioned she was dating someone and said she didn't know if it was serious or not. Then a year ago she introduced him to everyone and his daughter, Ruby. My sister remarried 4 months after introducing them to everyone. Zoe and Cole were not happy. Ruby wasn't happy either but wasn't saying anything to me about it directly.\n\nMy sister was aware of the issues with Ruby and the fact there were some long standing bad feelings there. She was not deterred by this and instead she tried to pretend they were all new to each other and attempted to get Zoe and Cole to include Ruby in their play, and for them to be the three musketeers instead of two peas in a pod. Zoe told her mom it was never going to happen and that Ruby doesn't belong in the family. She got punished harshly for that. Cole told my sister he didn't like Ruby and just because she was Ruby's stepmom now, it didn't change anything. My sister looked for me to back her up and tell him it changed everything but I did not. She told me I should have had her back.\n\nA few days went by and then she told me we needed to talk and said I needed to support getting the kids to bond together and give Ruby a chance because she has no extended family and she's having a rough time in school. I asked my sister what she meant by that. She was reluctant to say. I asked if her husband was getting calls about how Ruby treats other kids. She didn't deny it. I told her she can't erase what Zoe and Cole think of Ruby and she needs to accept that. That Ruby has not proven to be a friend to them and they have more history with her being mean to others than they do with her being her stepdaughter.\n\nShe said they're 10 and have so much more room to grow. I told her this is true, but you can't ask people to like someone who is mean to them and their friends. My sister said I am being too hard on Ruby and I'm an AH for defending Ruby being excluded.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1682414121, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12ydt23/aita_for_telling_my_sister_she_cant_erase_what/", "score": 418, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You have to help her get whatever help she needs to be a good person, and my children do not \"have\" to play with her. You forcing them makes you a bully too, and I will not tolerate anyone who forces my children to engage in behaviours or situations that make them uncomfortable. That's a dangerous precedent to set for many reasons. End of story. Your sister is T A. You are NTA", "NTA. That kid is obviously mean as F and I'm actually a bit taken aback, that your sister is trying to downplay that. You should never force kids to \"like\" or include someone who clearly bullied them and their friends and I'm actually questioning your sisters intelligence for acting like that.", "So your sister married the father of her and your kid\u2019s bully?

NTA but your sister sure is.", "NTA - This isn\u2019t a workplace where Zoe and Cole have to get along with Ruby regardless of her behaviour. These are kids and her behaviour is *the only thing* that will change their minds.", "NTA\n\nSounds like Ruby has been lashing out at others for some time now. The kids aren\u2019t going to integrate into a family unit without her behavioral issues addressed, either through therapy, discipline, or a mix of both.", "NTA\n\nYou are having the kids' backs and I'm glad someone is. Your sister needs to listen a bit more to her daughter. It's good she's trying to include her stepdaughter but she would be better putting that energy into getting help for the very obvious bully nature this girl has. The girl has serious issues from the way it sounds and that's a larger problem then the kids not being open to trusting her right now.\n\nGood luck", "NTA. At her age it's really not Ruby's fault but her parents need to actively address her behavioral issues. I know this sub is full of 'go to therapy' suggestions but if it's a possibility to get Ruby some professional help then I don't think that's a bad idea. Based on my experience she does seem to be quite young to be getting into all this trouble.", "NTA at all. In any situation that involves step family, you can't force a connection. There's no law that says step siblings have to have a relationship. They need to treat each other with respect, sure. But they don't have to be buddies.", "NTA. Ruby is part of Zoe and Cole\u2019s blended family now. That\u2019s okay. At the same time, they already had a relationship. Not a good one. It would be nice for Ruby if her bad actions didn\u2019t have consequences. But that\u2019s not how the works works. It\u2019s not how Zoe and Cole work, and forcing them to pretend otherwise would send a terrible message to them. The appropriate message is \u201cRuby\u2019s now part of the family\u201d. I\u2019m not sure exactly what that changes - it probably means that Ruby will be present at more family events, perhaps even on a day to day basis. Maybe it means her behavior towards her new family members will change - time will tell. Until then, taking Zoe, Cole or Ruby that they have to feel differently is a terrible message. Their feelings are valid, and the reality of modern blended families is that not everyone likes everyone, and that\u2019s okay.", "NTA. She seems to want her own daughter Zoe and her nephew Cole to do all the attitude readjustment and \u2018grow\u2019.  Are she and Ruby\u2019s father having some serious come to Jesus sessions with Ruby about her behavior?", "NTA\n\nKids don't tend to be awful without a reason, so it's likely that Ruby was really struggling at home and didn't have the right supports and emotional outlets, so she acted out. Especially at the age you first heard about it, but even at 10, I can't really blame this on Ruby. She certainly has plenty of room to grow and change and become a perfectly lovely person.\n\nAt the same time, the other two have had nothing but bad experiences with her, and that doesn't magically go away because she's family now. They *do* need to understand that she's family, that she has just as much of a right to be in the family as they do, and that she's not going anywhere. They *don't* have to like it or to be her friend right away. Hopefully as they all grow up and Ruby recovers, they'll form a closer bond, but you can't force a bond on kids. If you try to force it, all you'll build is their resentment.", "NTA. Ruby is a bully. She is young enough to change but how can that happen if nobody does anything about it. She should probably be in therapy.", "NTA but I think your sister is just trying to get the kids to build a relationship since they are living under the same roof. Ruby is obviously troubled and this is probably due to not having a mom and having her dad spend his time with a new woman. Zoe and Cole are excluding Ruby in is what now her home and I get she's a bully but you as an adult shouldn't support them excluding her as well because she's a kid. Maybe you should also spend some time with Ruby. I honestly just don't want people to give up on Ruby because she can be helped at this point in her life. You and your sister can be the women in her life that she never had and teach her not to bully. That being said I am impressed with the boundaries these kids have. You guys must have raised them well. I recommend getting Ruby some help if nothing else works, but I honestly don't think shunning should be the answer.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
