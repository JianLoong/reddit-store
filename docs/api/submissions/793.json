That comment is incredibly worrisome, and here's why:\n\nOCD is a mental illness. Like any other mental illness it can vary tremendously in intensity, but if he has rituals that last an hour-and-a-half to two hours and that's after he has \"tremendously improved\" then he is in DIRE need of individual treatment. What you are describing is not any objective person's idea of \"improvement\". It is OCD being allowed to run its course pretty close to unchecked.\n\nThe fallout of his mental illness is so significant that it is taking up HOURS of his day, when you have not just an infant to take care of, but one who it seems has, if not a full-blown disability, then extensive care needs. More responsibilities, more work, more exhausting things are falling on you as a new parent (already a very tough job, and more physically demanding because you are breastfeeding) SPECIFICALLY DUE TO HIS OCD RITUALS. And not 5 or 10 minutes' worth here or there, but SEVERAL HOURS A DAY. \n\nAnd the thing is, there is no reason for that. Most people even with very severe OCD find that their rituals and compulsions can be drastically minimised and mitigated with medication and coping strategies . . . BUT HE HAS TO SEE A DOCTOR for that. It's not a cure, but there should absolutely be ways to address his having to spend two hours in the bathroom every single time he has to defecate.\n\nThe fact that your husband \"doesn't see a need\" is, at this point, blatantly selfish. And whoever suggested that you start pumping and using bottles missed the point completely. THIS IS NOT ON YOU TO MANAGE EVEN MORE. If you find that exclusively breastfeeding works for you, then you should not have to change that because your husband refuses to acknowledge or manage his mental illness. He is a grown man, a husband, and now a father. He has a responsibility to his wife and his child, and that includes not ignoring his own health issues - including his mental health. \n\nI strongly suggest that you gently but firmly tell him that his OCD is, at this point, keeping him from holding up his side of parenting duties, and you NEED him to get help, to seek a psychiatrist, therapy and possibly medication if indicated. \"Better\" as it stands is not good enough. You deserve better than this, and honestly, so does he, for his own well-being. NTA.", "NTA.  He needs therapy.", "Get a breast pump for bottles - time for daddy to step up - especially at night.  He get irritable an struggles to see your point?  Then show him.  Pump the bottles, make a list, and let him do it - at least two - four days IN A ROW.  Sometimes it's better to learn things on your own.  Good luck.  NTA", "Nta. If he has to do that a specific time every night then you guys need to work at a schedule and have him take care of the baby well you make dinner or something and then you watch baby and he cleans up", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Does he spend 2 hours in the bathroom every day at work? Or when he has free time? I\u2019m not super familiar with OCD and that definitely adds an extra layer to the complexity, but I don\u2019t have time to spend 2 hours in the bathroom every night and I don\u2019t even have kids. If he\u2019s not able to compromise there, he needs to suggest other areas where he can pick up the slack for you. I also think that if he is not able to compromise on that, it\u2019s time for him to get some serious therapy/look into meds for his OCD. He\u2019s a parent now, that means doing things you don\u2019t wanna do.", "I would suggest seeing a psychiatrist first and foremost.

There is mostly a disbalance in time.", "Thanks for responding so extensively. Its given me some real insight to discuss with him. I agree with him that he has improved a lot, but that just says sonething about how debilatating his situation was before. Better is not good enough (yet).

The issue is his OCD rituals cause him to need to take a lot of time for mental stability.
