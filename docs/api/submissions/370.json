My cousin Maeve (26F) is a selfish and manipulative person. Maeve has started untrue rumors to bully/isolate others since middle school and has never grown out of it. She takes advantage of others, especially family, at any opportunity. My sister Dawn\u2019s best friend gave her a necklace before she passed away. Maeve knew about the necklace\u2019s significance to Dawn yet sold it at a pawn shop so she would have extra cash to treat her own friends to a movie night. When confronted, Maeve tried to justify her toxic behavior by arguing that it wasn\u2019t a big deal since my parents were able to buy the necklace back. Dawn and I exploded on Maeve and we haven\u2019t talked to her since. If Maeve happens to be at a family function, we only give her one-word answers if necessary and otherwise pretend she doesn\u2019t exist.\n\nWe had a recent family event, everyone was just told it was very important and to come if possible. It turns out the party was for Maeve to come out as a lesbian. Maeve came up to me and asked if I was going to congratulate her as well. (Keep in mind, Maeve has never apologized for her toxic/manipulative behavior towards us.) I just said \u201cI guess\u201d and tried to leave, but then Maeve accused me of being homophobic and questioned why I was not praising/congratulating her. I told Maeve that her being a lesbian literally means nothing to me, and her coming out doesn\u2019t change the fact that she\u2019s a shit person. Maeve was obviously upset but I just left.\n\nMost of my friends (many of who are queer) agree with me because being queer has no relevance to someone\u2019s toxic/manipulative behavior. Trash is trash, queer or straight. Maeve being a lesbian doesn\u2019t change any of her toxic/manipulative behavior. But a few called me an asshole because even though I have queer friends, I\u2019m still straight and don\u2019t truly understand how much courage it takes to come out. They said I could have just said I was proud of her for being courageous enough to come out and left it there, instead of starting drama and insulting Maeve at her own coming out party. Some of them are also arguing that it\u2019s very hard having to hide yourself from others, and even though it wasn\u2019t healthy or right to others, Maeve\u2019s toxic/manipulative behavior was just the way she knew how to cope with her emotions. And I could have taken the chance to reach out to Maeve and get to know the new her instead of doing what I did. I know I\u2019m probably an asshole for saying what I did at Maeve\u2019s own coming out party, but I still see what I said as being justified.
