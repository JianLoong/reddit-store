Yesterday my CILs husband asked me to switch his spark plugs on his Mercedes. I went to his house got a picture of his VIN drove all the way to the Mercedes dealership which is like 30 minutes away from my house and bought him the spark plugs with my own money. I took his car home and changed his spark plugs and his timing belt and then I took the car back to his house. \n\n\nMy son has the same model Mercedes that he does but my sons navigation doesn\u2019t work,\nso this morning when my CILs husband and I met up with some of our other friends I asked if I could try my sons navigation cd in his car and it worked so when I gave him cd back and he put it in his car and it wasn\u2019t working. His cd hasn\u2019t been working for a couple of days. Now my sons cd has some scratches on it which how it came when he got the car. \nSo out of the blue this man starts yelling at me saying that I switched his cd with my sons even though my sons cd has scratches and his doesn\u2019t. So I told him if you feel that way you can just take this one. He yelled at me that he didn\u2019t want it and he got in his car and drove off. It was really embarrassing because it happened in front of everyone.\n\n\nWhen I got home I decide that I didn\u2019t want to speak to them anymore because I felt really disrespected. My wife had gone to their house after the interaction and CILs husband asked why I didn\u2019t come which made me even more mad because how can you do something like that then pretend like nothing happened.", "created_utc": 1667154404, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yhlyml/aita_for_being_mad_after_being_accused_of/", "score": 5, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
