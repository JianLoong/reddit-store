That said, the kid didn\u2019t ask to exist and doesn\u2019t deserve animosity for circumstances it can\u2019t help. If you end up interacting with the kid down the line, they deserve respect (by virtue of being a child - sharing a father has nothing to do with you owing the kid respect).

If you plan to continue having some kind of relationship with them when this kid is born, you\u2019re going to have to accept that you\u2019ll end up being around the kid eventually, and you need to be respectful and kind to the kid no matter your feelings towards them or the situation. You don\u2019t have to go out of your way, and you certainly don\u2019t have to act like their sibling, but you do have to be kind and fair.

I don\u2019t have the emotional availability to be there for *another* child that way. I basically had to mother my little brother after my parents divorced (he was 13 at the time), and my sister lets me have a relationship with my niece that is purely as aunt/niece. My little brother still comes to me for things that a kid would normally take to parents. He wants me to know things and be there for things before our parents. I can\u2019t do that again, especially because my dad has leaned on me heavily in the past and my nervous breakdown basically happened because I was a 20 year old mothering my 13 year old little brother and that continued for years. \n\nSo it\u2019s not hate.

I practically went numb and catatonic when my dad told me. Had a series of panic attacks for days afterwards that my service dog kept alerting to. I know my reaction was probably wild as hell and seems over the top. I do. But I just have a lot of trauma surrounding family after what happened with having to parent my little brother.

I practically had to raise my little brother through his teens and then force my dad to be more emotionally involved after a few years when I had a nervous breakdown.

There\u2019s a *lot* of background that got left out if only because I\u2019ve pretty much pushed through and resolved those issues but basically all my sister and I asked was no one our age and then. Well. You see what happened. I pretty much distanced myself from his mess and was forced to focus on my little brother because he was having a really hard time since NW moved in only a couple months after the divorce proceedings started and dad kinda fumbled the ball for a few years with all of that.

You carry the emotional burden for your family, plus he moved (presumably) affair partner in within months, plus she is younger than his daughter and he doesn't seem to notice that that might be uncomfortable for you.  You don't have to have a relationship with new baby, but you probably don't have to announce it either. You've been staying away anyway, just keep that up"]}
