You are none of these.", "Clearly you are in the doghouse, but personally I don't think you should be. 'Pouting for days' is a pretty extreme reaction to not receiving a gift. NTA", "INFO: how long have you been together? Do you have a relationship with her son? Live together?", "NTA, I really don't understand the logic here. Her son isn't your kid, she's not your mom. What is there to celebrate?", "I can never understand why anyone would expect something from a partner,if there wasn't a child they had to buy for. She is not your mother. NTA.", "I'm going with NTA, especially because the kids dad is active and OP said that they did something with the mum to celebrate. I'm confused why the gf would then expect OP to contribute.", "I mean you don\u2019t have to ask us if you are in the doghouse, you seem to be in the doghouse.\n\nI personally agree that the kid isn\u2019t yours and why the hell would you celebrate her moming him. \n\nBut it also may have been nice to simply wish her a happy Mother\u2019s Day or do something nearly microscopic and nothing else.", "Nah, obviously you guys have different expectations. That weren\u2019t communicated. \n\nYes she a mom however its not your child. I understand you not seeing as needing to do something for her on that day. However I also see her side of it. That regardless or not biological her child is not yours. She is still a mom. \n\nLong term if you guys stay together and you take on step parent position. Would you still not get her anything?", "NTA\n\nStill relatively early in the relationship, so still learning things about one another. Talk about the expectations here - I can see why you wouldn\u2019t feel obliged to get a gift, and, judging from the comments here, it\u2019s a bit of a line ball whether you should or not, but why not er on the side of doing something nice for your partner in the future?\n\nThat said, pouting for days about an uncommunicated difference in expectations sounds a little excessive.\n\nEdit: mobile typo.", "NTA . She chose to spend the day with someone else. I don't feel like you owe her card and flowers", "NTA in my opinion. Are people this desperate for gifts and prizes?", "NTA, she's your missus, not your mother. And like you said, it's not even your kid", "You\u2019re not in the wrong, but would it have killed you to celebrate your girlfriend for being a mom?", "NAH but if you\u2019re dating a mother are you open to the possibility of being a step-father one day or will you always have this \u201cnot my kid, not my problem\u201d attitude? You\u2019re only a year in now, but will you still have the same attitude 5 or 10 years down the line? I had no idea people were so divided on this! I wish my sisters Happy Mother\u2019s Day even though they\u2019re not my mother, because I appreciate them and all they sacrifice for their kids but they surely wouldn\u2019t pout if I forgot.", "NTA - she's not your mom, she's not your kid's mom (if you actually had any that is), so it's inapplicable and from my POV inappropriate.  I've never wished it to anyone who's not my  mom or my kids' mom, never have and never will.  It's a frickin' Hallmark holiday - who wants to be a marketing victim?", "Nta", "NTA.\n\nAnd if she doesn\u2019t stop pouting, then you probably need to stop the relationship.", "NTA but need to have a talk about expectations in a new relationship.

Mother\u2019s Day is to celebrate mothers, which she is, even if it\u2019s not your kid. Do you think she\u2019s a good mom? Are you involved in her kid\u2019s life? Do you think she deserves to be recognized for working hard as a mom? At some point you\u2019ll need to decide if you view her as a mother or as your girlfriend, because right now it sounds like you only see her as a girlfriend, and not as a mother- but if you continue a relationship that will have to evolve. Most moms don\u2019t separate their mom life from the rest of themself- to love them is to love a mother, so saying you don\u2019t care or recognize their motherhood is to basically dismiss a huge portion of who they are and what is important to them. \n\nYeah, it\u2019s not your kid, but her being a mom is important to her, and we want what is important to ourselves to be important to our partners. I think you likely have a fundamental mismatch of priorities, honestly.", "Nta but next year, take kiddo to get something special for HIS mother", "NTA", "NTA You give mothers day cards/gifts to YOUR mother so anything she got should be from her kid. Its bollocks like this that show you why you should avoid single moms!", "It's mother's day, not \"my child day\". I'd say NAH, this wasn't really a asshole move on your part.", "NTA\n\nHowever, you are dating someone who happens to be a mother. Maybe just take her and her son out for the day would show her that you care.", "NTA\n\nShe\u2019s not your mother and you don\u2019t have kids with her. Also grow a pair and call her on her crappy behavior. Personally would breakup if this is how petty she is being over something this small. Major red flag imo", "Soft YTA. Yes it's true you don't \\*have\\* to do anything for mother's day as it's not your kid. But would it really have been so much to just give her a card and maybe go out for a meal together? You don't have to do it but it would mean so much to her for relatively little effort on your part.", "ESH. The pouting is childish. However, you could have at least given her a card. My last partner sucked at most things, but he did do that. He just gave me a thoughtful card saying how much he admired what I did for my kids. I gave him a card for Father's Day, even though I hadn't really met his kids", "NTA is she planning on giving you something for fathers day? Cuz you're right unless you have a kid with her or have been in their life for a long time there is no reason for getting her anything yet.", "I dont know, NTA sort of.  \nI mean you sure didnt have to sort something out on mothers day in this situation. but  that doesnt mean that you couldnt do something nice for her.   \nIs she right to be pouting... no.  \nWhat i think is weird though is that she went out to dinner with her ex.", "NAH\n\nNo one is strictly speaking an asshole, but you're both doing the same stupid thing: not communicating well. You and your GF clearly have different perspectives on your roles in each other's lives. You need to work on getting on the same page.\n\nThere's a possible silver lining: if you have a good relationship with GF's son and she associates you with \"family\" holidays, she's probably really into you. If you're long-term interesting in her and you work to iron out the communication issue, you could have a really great life ahead.", "Very soft YTA. Only cuz come on man, you\u2019re with a girl who has a kid that she\u2019s obviously involved with. At least gotta do flowers or something. Doing nothing for her on Mother\u2019s Day kinda makes it seem like you don\u2019t think of her as a mom or value her kid with her. Mother\u2019s Day is for the mothers. Are you not involved with the kid at all? Being with her would make you the Step-Dad. Though it kinda seems like you don\u2019t view it that way.", "YTA. I know it\u2019s not your kid, but your gf is a mom. You have a relationship with her kid. You\u2019ve been dating for a year. You didn\u2019t think to at least get $8 flowers? Cmon man\u2026. Though the pouting for days is a bit much. But I\u2019m sure she is thinking about y\u2019all\u2019s long term relationship goals and whether you can be a good family/spouse and not acknowledging her on Mother\u2019s Day probably upset her more from that aspect", "ESH- you have a relationship with her son, She\u2019s not your mom but she is a Mom and you are dating her! It would have been nice for you to celebrate her. That being said I think pouting for days is a slight overreaction on her end", "YTA/NTA mix- YTA- please don\u2019t be one of those \u201cbut she\u2019s not MY mom\u201d dudes. It is very insulting and cooking her bfast or grabbing flowers is a wonderful gesture as a sign of respect to her as a good mom . \nNow- NTA bc she did dinner with her ex for Mother\u2019s Day lmao not my scene . Her and her kid or thr 3 of you should\u2019ve went , it isn\u2019t Father\u2019s Day \ud83d\ude1d", "YTA, She's still a mom even if it's not your child.", "YTA she\u2019s a mother, one you hopefully like - didn\u2019t have to be extravagant but to not acknowledge her was an AH move.", "YTA it's a celebration of all mothers and motherhood. And just putting that aside, man just have some sense. Are you trying to impress this person or not?", "Ehhh. Barely NTA? Like, not an asshole thing to do, but it would have taken 0 time or effort to so much as get a card for her and it clearly matters to her.", "[deleted]", "I would have thought that as a partner and being a mother, some flowers and a card show that you recognise her as a mother. You don't need to be the child's parent or have your GF as a mother to recognise she is a mother. Just common sense. \n\nThat being said, she's pouting for not receiving anything from you is silly so I make her a soft AH because you are not her child or the childs father but then you are in a serious long term relationship with her so poor show for not acknowledging her as a mom. Soft AH for you too.", "YTA, she is a mother... Actually just save her the ache and cut the relationship.", "YTA.
