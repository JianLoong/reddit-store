Because this is a day about her and I\u2019d want to make her feel as special as possible. His girl is hurt he didn\u2019t acknowledge her, but he\u2019s NTA for not doing so as he just wasn\u2019t sure. Now he knows what she likes for next year. She doesn\u2019t need to pout about it for days though.", "I explained my verdict, you can reread the first sentence on what Mother\u2019s Day is :)\n\nBut if you want my simplified reasoning, because his in a relationship with a single mother, that\u2019s why. It\u2019s odd not to even give a $1 card on Mother\u2019s Day to the woman your in a relationship with, especially if you\u2019ve met her child & plan to be in her life long term.", "Yea.. he can still take them out. Just because bio dad did doesn't mean he can't take them out to do something.", "Yep. Bunch of men in this thread saying \u201cshe\u2019s not his mom\u201d or \u201cnot his kid\u201d\u2026. They\u2019re in a long term relationship and being a mom is an important aspect of her life. Anything that\u2019s important to your partner should be important enough for you to acknowledge. Especially since she\u2019s so upset about it, it was obviously important to her.", "This attitude of \"Not his kid not his problem\" is a bit surprising to me because... he is dating a mom... Why is he dating a mother when he can't even appreciate her actually being a mother? Mother's Day is all about appreciating. He could've at least bought some flowers. Or written a card. Especially because they've been dating for a year and he has a great relationship with her son (according to him). \n\nBut pouting for days is a bit much tbh (+ considering the fact that she spent a day with her baby daddy it's really not that much of a big deal) ... ESH or NAH if it were me.", "That\u2019s for her to raise though. He\u2019s not a mind reader.", "I\u2019m not sure going by Hallmark et al\u2019s capitalistic desire for profits is the best yardstick.", ">I feel like half these Mothers Day disappointments could be avoided if men just asked their wives/girlfriends \u201cIs there anything special you would like to do on Mothers Day? \n\nbut that would mean that these big boys would have to use their grown-up words...\n\nsigh\n\nYou're absolutely right, though.", "I feel like half these mother's day disappoints could be avoided if women told their husbands/boyfriend \"Hey, I would really appreciate it if you could...... for me for mother's day.\"\n\nYes, I know that getting something is nice and thoughtful but communication is a two way street. But early in a relationship saying what you would like and not leaving this dude to navigate this solo would be kind\n\nEdited: spelling", "he's not the kid's dad though. why does that make him an asshole?", "My ex wife and I deal with the other's mother's/father's day parents with the children's it's part of parenting. It seems both parents are going out with the children so no need for step-op to step up.", "He didn't even get her a card.", "Okay but like you wish random mother's happy mother's day in general. It's just a celebration of mother's. It's weird that people are trying to assign the responsibility of  celebrating mother's soley on the dad's and children.", "Are they your romantic partners?", "No no, it\u2019s a holiday for children to celebrate their mothers. Mothers do not deserve presents from everyone in their life on Mother\u2019s Day. It\u2019s not Christmas for mothers. Jfc", "For you, perhaps, but for plenty it\u2019s about your mum and your mum alone.", "I don\u2019t use it often, way less than some people here use \u201cnarcissist.\u201d", "That\u2019s not how it is at all here! I got texts and Facebook tags all day from friends and family and coworkers. We don\u2019t do big gifts for mothers/Father\u2019s Day but my husband absolutely helps the kids and got me a gift (under $10 and all I need) everyone made me feel very special and it was nice. I do the same on Father\u2019s Day, and I don\u2019t see anything wrong with spreading cheer to as many of my friends and family as possible", ">Mother's Day is all about appreciating. \n\nYes, appreciating one's mom or the mom of one's kids.  It's not a general thing for anyone who's ever birthed; that's why it's Mother's Day, not Mothers' Day.  \n\nI find it bizarre when anyone outside my family wishes me a HFD.", "You\u2019re thinking about this a bit backwards. Hallmark wants to make $$$. They are not going to sell cards that aren\u2019t making them money. You could say they put them out in hopes someone will buy them but that\u2019s not exactly how it works, if there\u2019s no demand for the card they\u2019re not just going to stick them out every year. The cards are there because people are buying them.\n\nAdditionally, I shop for cards at the dollar tree, so these cards are 2/$1.25. They\u2019re there because of demand", "Yes, communication is definitely a two-way street. But if you consider that the majority of emotional labor is done by the women in the relationship, men need to learn to initiate communication. I think a lot of moms are just tired of having to initiate everything including presents and special days for themselves. I in no way think OP is an asshole here. It would help his a relationship if he helps initiate communicating about expectations around holidays.", "Yep always gotta put it on the woman. They\u2019re doing 99% of the emotional labor as usual.", "Because it's about celebrating his girlfriend not about celebrating her child.", "Because she's still a mom and a 9 year old is unlikely to take the initiative himself. In my experience, any decent dad/boyfriend takes it upon himself to make sure that their wife/girlfriend has a good mother's day, especially when the kid is too young to do that himself. \n\nHonestly my Dad did this to me one year and I will never understand why. Up until we were like 13 or 14, my Dad would always get my mom a gift from all of us, and then we probably brought home some BS art thing from school for her. Suddenly, one year he said and did nothing for Mother's day and he came to us a couple of days after saying Mom was upset we hadn't done anything for her and that we were old enough to be doing these things for ourselves. He could have at least given us a heads up, but instead he did nothing. I realized a few years later that he had probably forgotten and decided to throw us under the bus.\n\nI'm seeing a lot of these posts and I feel like 90% of them are either the dad forgetting and trying to find an excuse, or could have otherwise been fixed by simply asking Mom what her expectations are for mother's day.", "It's the attitude of not understanding that yeah, dads should celebrate mother's day probably moreso than minor children. I'm not saying it's expected now (though honestly it would just be a thoughtful thing to do for your partner, yours or not) but his lack of understanding on mother's day just shows him to be an asshole dude that when and if he has his own kids will probably be equally thoughtless.", "True. Didn\u2019t remember that..", "Not his mom, not a mother of his child. I don\u2019t see a problem..", "Who in the world is wishing random mothers happy mothers day. That is incredibly weird", "Was that the question?", "If he is not the baby\u2019s daddy or her son, he doesn\u2019t has anything to celebrate. NTA", "She had a mothers day. She literally went Out with the Dad and her child and celebrated it. The DAD did something for mothers day", "Appreciating that he sees all the work she does and that she's important? Why are people so deadset against doing a nice thing for your partner?", "His long term girlfriend is a MOTHER. it\u2019s MOTHERS day. If I see a friend out who\u2019s a mother on Mother\u2019s Day I would say \u201chey happy Mother\u2019s Day\u201d because she\u2019s a mom. If you\u2019re dating someone who is a mother, you should acknowledge that on Mother\u2019s Day.", "Y\u2019all? If I had a child, and my boyfriend wasn\u2019t the father of that child, I wouldn\u2019t expect anything from my bf. But apparently some do, hence communicate!"]}
