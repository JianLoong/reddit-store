Most moms don\u2019t separate their mom life from the rest of themself- to love them is to love a mother, so saying you don\u2019t care or recognize their motherhood is to basically dismiss a huge portion of who they are and what is important to them. \n\nYeah, it\u2019s not your kid, but her being a mom is important to her, and we want what is important to ourselves to be important to our partners.
