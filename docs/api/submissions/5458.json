Even folks for whom math \"is not their thing\" learn enough to understand money, measure how big a throw rug needs to be, and follow a recipe.  Your husband needs to work on getting to a \"just getting by\" level of Spanish.  Even if his Spanish always suck and he never gets past the level of a Spanish-speaking kindergartener, I suspect your family will appreciate the effort and be a lot more willing to bend their \"Spanglish\" toward the English side to help him.

I know this is a very different situation and not the best comparison, but my cousin is deaf, and at family gatherings we don't all use ASL only (most don't know it anyway) or write down what we're all saying for her to read- but if she is nearby and looks like she wants to talk or join the conversation, we will write down what we're saying so she can be included. Why can't the family realize  \"Oh OPs Husband is joining this convo, let's try to speak mostly English or at least help interpret a little better so he can be included as well\"\n\nI gave up when trying to learn Spanish because I struggled, but I also didn't have a full extended family who spoke the language so I had little motivation.
