Even folks for whom math \"is not their thing\" learn enough to understand money, measure how big a throw rug needs to be, and follow a recipe.  Your husband needs to work on getting to a \"just getting by\" level of Spanish.  Even if his Spanish always suck and he never gets past the level of a Spanish-speaking kindergartener, I suspect your family will appreciate the effort and be a lot more willing to bend their \"Spanglish\" toward the English side to help him.

I know this is a very different situation and not the best comparison, but my cousin is deaf, and at family gatherings we don't all use ASL only (most don't know it anyway) or write down what we're all saying for her to read- but if she is nearby and looks like she wants to talk or join the conversation, we will write down what we're saying so she can be included.

I was riding a bus in Colombia, this chick sat next to me, we chatted for over an hour in 100% Spanish - I struggled for words at times but we managed a pretty decent talk.\n\nOn the other hand I also lived in China for almost a year, and in a place with no other westerners around me so I was pretty well immersed (this was Inner Mongolia twenty years ago).  Even though I learned to read about 600-700 characters I never got past the basics of conversation - I could order food, handle simple directions, but that was pretty much it.  Never even got close to what I could do with Spanish.", "Did you leave off the sarcasm tag?", "I would make the most condescending announcement and signs I possibly could - in Spanish only. \u201cOP\u2019s husband is lazy and self-centered, so we\u2019re asking that everyone humor his feeeeelings and speak only English, as that\u2019s the only language he\u2019s capable of.\u201d", "I'm glad and you're welcome!", "I would really like to know how OP thinks the family would enforce the English only utltimatum.", "I haven't even seen the show and I bet I know exactly how she does.", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "It opens up a whole new bunch of job opportunities too - being a native (or at least, well learned) speaker in English + another popular language like Spanish can mean pay raises, translator positions, even interpreter jobs. Pretty short sighted of him.", "My only experience with Spanish is playing duolingo casually for about a year and I understand most of what you posted - enough to get the gist of what you are saying. OPs husband doesn't seem to be even trying.", ">!Pobrecito bebe!\n\n\n\nl\u00e1stima que no aprendi\u00f3 espa\u00f1ol (this is 100% Google translate).", "lmao three milk cake is the whitest shit I've ever heard", "I am from the more French part of Canada and struggled with French my whole life. YEARS spent and man do I still struggle. On the other hand, I learnt Korean in about an eighth of the time I spent with French. My husband is from Poland and I can say maybe two words in Polish. Languages are tough.", "I\u2019m just so fucking sorry. All of my grandparents came to Canada from Ukraine, and I\u2019m almost glad they didn\u2019t live to see this. \n\nI hope your life in Poland is enough for now and you bust out a few hits to keep people warm during this bitter harvest.", "This exactly!! I can't imagine demanding my own family not speak German when my spouse was in THEIR house. The entitlement there is amazing. My family has a lot of different languages mixed in. Both of my brother in laws speak native Hindi but know English and other languages as well. I'm always impressed at how they switch from language to language with ease, I've tried to learn Hindi over the last four years. Going to their families house I'm usually one of the only ones who don't speak it fluently - but they see I make an effort, google translator has helped and they never make me feel like I don't belong there. I just can't get over the thought of feeling like it's my right to say no, you can not speak your language in front of me. It's amazing someone would think this was acceptable.", "Yeah, it's not even that he's not willing to try to communicate. He not willing to take a plate of food, say \"gracias\" and then sit quietly and enjoy being with his wife and the people who make her happy.", ">\u00a1Pobrecito beb\u00e9!\n\nThe second one\u2019s good, haha", "I have relatives in the Netherlands and worked there a couple of summers when I was 21 and 24! I could get away with speaking only Enligsh (and Portuguese with some family) but because everyone around me would be talking to themselves in Dutch, eventually I picked up on enough to understand a few words here and there, some full sentences etc. I love languages so I was more attuned to it but still! 10 years of exposure is long enough for someone to pick up Spanish\n\nEdit to also add: (not bragging, just giving examples) I also worked as a TEFL teacher for a couple of years. Most of my students were from Bangladesh and though they spoke really fast in their language, I was still able to caught on a few words such as \"Understand?\"! An open mind and exposure can really do wonders. This man is l a z y and entitled!", "Funny, I just made a comment that Spanish is relatively easy and that it's not like he's expected to learn Mandarin.", ">The husband seems like he is refusing to learn.\n\nHe'd almost certainly have to be actively trying not to learn to not pick anything up after this long.\n\nWhen joining another's family, there will always be some type of culture differences that need to be accepted to be considered part of the family.  That's not to say you must wholeheartedly agree with every difference but to tell OP's family what language they must use is just silly.\n\nSounds like hubby doesn't like OP's family and doesn't think they're worth the effort.", "This. My brother in law didn\u2019t know any Spanish and within two years of being around us and participating in conversations, he\u2019s able to answer back in Spanish. It\u2019s not fluent but it\u2019s enough to get his points across. OP\u2019s husband doesn\u2019t seem to be trying at all.", "I used to work with a kid who\u2019s family was from India and spoke Hindi. His mother would never speak directly to me, and would always send a child to translate. Until one day she was giving the child the message to ask me in Hindi and I just answered it. Then she started speaking to me directly (in English). I could never speak the language, but around certain topics I could understand enough to get the gist of what was being discussed.", "And how we teach languages in the US is counterproductive.  Kids need to start in elementary school, not waiting for Middle or High school.  Our brains are primed to learn languages early in life.", "Very British Empire white guy vibes.", "For real!!! I have lived in San Antonio and other parts of Texas off and on and I swear you just kind of absorb it unless you _actively try not to_", "100%. I\u2019m definitely not fluent in Spanish, but it\u2019s easy to speak Tex Mex: English is the base language and Spanish is the flavor", "Mmmhm. I'm Australian in an area without many Spanish speakers at all. I have absorbed hits of Spanish from American tv. Him not speaking Spanish after being married ten years sounds like a choice.\n\nUnless he has acquired brain damage in adulthood, he knows at least one language, he can learn a language. He doesn't even need to be able to speak it or understand grammar, he just needs to pick up understanding enough words when he hears it and be able to reply in english for this to be a non issue.", "But the great thing about it is\u2026he doesn\u2019t have to remember the accents and spelling the words and I\u2019m sure they would forgive him if the pronouns don\u2019t match the conjugated verb. He just has to speak. Even if he butchers it\u2026"]}
