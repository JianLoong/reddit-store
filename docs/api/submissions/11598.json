Tuesday she asked if  I knew anyone who wanted a working stove bc she was having a new one  delivered Thursday.  I called two of our farm low income employees.  Joe  says yes and that he can pick it up Friday which was the cut off date  my mother had set; she needs it out of the way.  Done deal.\n\nFriday,  yesterday, Joe's truck is broken so a friend of mine uses his truck to  go to mother's house.  Joe loads the stove in friend's truck and they  bring it back here to temp store in one of our barns.  My wife now sees  the stove and wants to keep it.\n\nWife  says ITA for not asking her first if she wanted it.  I had no idea she  wanted a second stove; she has never mentioned it before.  Just for  clarity sake, we have no place to put a second stove.  However, wife has  been planning on building a room in one of our barns for about 7 years.   I've not seen any of the plans for this room.  Today, for the first  time, she tells me she will use that stove in that possible future room.   I still have no idea what it would be used for.\n\nThis  morning she left a note for me to not give away the stove.  When I told  her I had already told Joe he could have it Tuesday, she called Joe and  told him he can't have it, she's going to keep it.\n\nWe  are a high income family, the cost of a new stove is meaningless to us.   But we are frugal and don't spend money frivolously.  I feel like Joe  should get the stove and if wife really wants one, she can go buy  another one.  Wife says I was wrong to give it away without asking her  first.  I told her, I didn't give it away, my mother did and that she's  stealing it from Joe, a highly valued farm hand that was difficult to  find.\n\nAITA for not consulting with my wife prior to giving this stove to our worker?", "created_utc": 1678070312, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11jlxsa/aita_for_giving_away_a_stove/", "score": 57, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you all want a used stove later then i guarentee you could find one on Clist for near nothing. If it were me I'd probably tell your wife she can keep it then go buy him a new one.", "NTA. \n\nYour wife\u2019s behavior is gross.", " NTA. Tell her to buy Joe a new stove if she wants to keep the vintage one.", "NTA but your wife is something else. She doesn't need this stove and can afford to buy a brand new one if she wants, but for some reason, wants to keep it from someone who actually needs it. I don't know if asshole is anywhere near strong enough a label here. This is just inexplicable to me. Please tell me that Joe is still going to get that stove?", "OP honestly put your foot down because your wife went way beyond boundaries for calling Joe and telling him he can't get it and that you were keeping it after everything that was originally promised.  The last thing that you need is for dissent between the other people working on your farm, as well as getting your mother involved due to your wife's outrageous selfishness.  If you allow it to happen it's just going to be the beginning of the end of a domino effect of how everyone is going to look and treat you with your working relationship.  It's likely just going to sit there collecting dust instead of actually getting used.", "NTA. Wasn't given to your wife. She can buy a new one.", "She might possibly one day build a room that needs a stove? I might possibly buy a house that has a helipad, that doesn't mean I'm going to hang on to a perfect good helicopter that someone else could use first. \n\nNTA. Give Joe the stove and apologize for wasting his time with this nonsense.", "NTA. Your wife sounds like a piece of work. That is the kindest thing I can think to say.  If she is willing to buy Joe a stove of equal or greater value that is fine.  If she wont do that - the stove is joes.", "NTA. Your wife reminds me of a little kid that sees another little kid with something interesting, and suddenly wants it and throws a tantrum for it.", "NTA. WTF is up with your wife? Does she have hoarding tendencies? Because squirreling away a perfectly good stove for a potential project in the far too distant future is crazy.", "NTA\n\nShe doesn\u2019t even have a place to put the stove.  She might, at a later date, but doesn\u2019t right now.\n\nTell her that when the time comes, she can upgrade the stove in her kitchen, and use her old one in the 2nd kitchen.  That way, the mice won\u2019t eat the wiring while it sits in the barn waiting.", "NTA\u2026but married to one.", "NTA but this would have me seriously questioning her motives and integrity. That\u2019s a really heartless move.", "NTA. Lovely wife you\u2019ve got there. You must be so proud.", "NTA but you wife\u2019s selfishness is breathtaking.  Please ensure Joe gets a stove.  Either that one or a new one.  Please don\u2019t stoop to your wife\u2019s level of assholery.", "NTA. Delivery that stove to Joe immediately and apologize for your wife! Yikes.", "NTA. Your wife is being greedy, and weird. Apparently she wants to keep a perfectly good working stove to just sit in the barn until she eventually gets around to making \u201ca room\u201d with no specified use, but that she\u2019ll need a stove for. It would be silly to go along with that. Most likely, the stove would sit in the barn unused, might wind up ruined by the elements, or with mice or other critters nesting in it, and if your wife ever actually gets around to making her room, by the time she does I guarantee she\u2019ll want a new stove. \n\nSo call Joe, tell him your wife was confused and the stove is indeed his. Then tell your wife her demands are bizarre and greedy, and the stove is NOT hers to keep \u2014 it was your mother\u2019s, she gave it to Joe, and that is a done deal. Make sure to tell her if she ever actually gets around to building this mysterious room you\u2019ll find a stove for it, but until then you don\u2019t want to hear any more about it.", "NTA. Let Joe have the stove. Your wife sounds like she only wanted it once it was already spoken for.", "NTA and your wife is letting her frugality make her into an AH that can\u2019t see the forest for for the trees. \n\nShe\u2019s frugal by choice. Other people are frugal by necessity. \n\nShe so fixated on her hypothetical future room, that she can\u2019t see the significant difference this stove could make to folks that are not as well resourced as she is.", "NTA, tell your lovely, greedy wife, she can have mine. It needs cleaning and I'd rather buy a new one than clean this one.", "YWBTA if you didn\u2019t give the stove to Joe after having promised it. Your wife is a giant greedy AH. Joe needs the stove, she doesn\u2019t.\n\nDefinitely NTA for not consulting your wife.", "NTA. The stove is your mother's to give. Her decision through you to give it to someone in need is sensible.  Is your wife even going to use this stove in a timely manner? Is the reno of the barn already underway? If no, she cannot expect you to intuit her desire for a beat up used stove at some indeterminate future time out of thin air. It may not even work after years of storage in a barn as mice chew through it. Just let it go and buy something else (new or used) when the time comes.", "NTA, your wife sounds awful.", "NTA.\n\nThere\u2019s no way you could have known your wife was considering a second stove.\n\nIt\u2019s also not her stove in any way.  It\u2019s Joes stove, and you\u2019re just storing it for him.  (Your mom gave it Joe, not to you.) Regardless of what your wife says, make sure it finds its way into joes truck to take home.", "If y'all got plenty of money, let wifey have the stove and buy Joe a stove, and tell her you're not going to break your word.", "op=NTA\n\nYour wife is being selfish.  \n\nYour mother asked you to find someone who wanted it--you did.  Give it to Joe, stand up to your wife's selfishness.", "It seems like there was miscommunication between you and your wife about the stove, and you had no reason to believe that she wanted a second stove. However, it also seems like your wife's sudden desire to keep the stove and use it in a future room is causing unnecessary conflict and may be causing harm to your relationship with your employee.\n\nIt's understandable that your wife wants to have input on decisions that affect your household, but in this case, the stove was already promised to someone else before she expressed interest in it. It may be worth discussing with your wife why she feels so strongly about keeping the stove, and whether there are alternative solutions that could satisfy both her and your employee.\n\nOverall, it's a tough situation, but it doesn't seem like you are necessarily the asshole in this scenario.\n\nBased on the situation, I would say NAH. It seems like there was miscommunication between you and your wife about whether or not she wanted a second stove, but it's also understandable that you didn't think to ask since she had never mentioned it before. It's also understandable that your wife would want to keep the stove, but it's important to consider the commitment you made to Joe and the fact that it's already been promised to him. Perhaps you and your wife can come to a compromise, such as allowing Joe to have the stove and then purchasing a new one for your wife's potential future room.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

To tip something out from under someone who (1) actually needs it, and (2) is in an uneven power dynamic with you and whose livelihood depends on a trusting relationship with you.

Don't be surprised if he ends up not being one of the farm employees sometime soon.", "Better start looking for Joe\u2019s replacement now that he knows how he rates with your family.", "NTA your wife has bigger issues here clearly...", "NTA - it's your MOM'S decision!

Brilliant.", "NTA That stove will rust away in the barn before your wife uses it.", "NTA. It wasn't your responsibility to guess that your wife might want a stove she's never mentioned wanting before, to put in a room of mysterious purpose, which she hasn't taken any substantial steps toward building for the better part of a decade. By the time you had an inkling that she would have wanted it, the stove had already been given to Joe and it would have been wrong to take it from him."]}
