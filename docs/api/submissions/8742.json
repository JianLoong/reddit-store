She has every right to let her brother stay but he has no right to ask that he leave for a very reasonable reason?", "OP said that the BIL was supposed to \"come back\" today and they didn't even notice that he was already gone, so no, he didn't ask him to just sleep in a hotel, he asked him not to set his feet in his house while his kids were there.", "DING DING DING\n\nThis isn't a few hours at the family cookout.

This isn't a \"very reasonable reason\" Anyways but you don't tell someone they can come stay with you and then after a few days be like \"oh yeah, you can't stay anymore because my ex hasn't met you.\" That's not reasonable at all.

I would never let my daughter stay in a home with someone I don\u2019t know or trust. It\u2019s not even about meeting them. A hi and bye would not change my stance on this in the least bit.

The woman was in his children's life well before the newborn.\n\nIf the woman you send your children to every so often is trustworthy enough to not kick up a fuss about, so is her family.\n\nSaying otherwise is incredibly sexist.", "So it's more reasonable to make the guy leave they told was welcome and could stay there than it is to expect the ex just to come meet the guy if that's what she wants? Really?", "I mean how entitled is the ex really? She didn't make an attempt to meet the guy, she didn't offer to switch weekends, she just says he needs to make the guy leave because she hasn't met him. And he just does.

That's how the world is unfortunately.", "He's not even really leaving, or at least wasn't supposed to; he was just sleeping elsewhere.

He probably just nodded along with the ex and then tried to make it BIL's problem and not his own.", "No indication as to how long they\u2019ve been coparenting.

What makes her such a better judge of character then everyone else?", "Eh, see what makes this feel manipulative to me is they've obviously been divorced for a good long while for OP to be remarried with a new baby. So if this is important to the ex why hasn't it been brought up before? If i had young kids i could see myself wanting to know who they are around and i would bring that up when we were making the parenting agreement and make sure we're both on the same page with that. But instead of raising this issue in the previous year or more, the ex waits until the new wife's brother is visiting and demands he leave. That sounds more like she's pissy about the new baby and him moving on than she legit has an issue with her kids being around people she doesn't know.", "He was made to leave his sisters home where he was told he was welcome and could stay. That absolutely is an issue. Especially when it was far from the only solution to this.", "Oh i agree OP sucks the most, lol. I can't even imagine being the wife who found out after the fact that her brother was asked to leave her home because the ex didn't want him there.", "They've obviously been coparenting for close to or over a year for OP to be remarried with a new baby. This is the kind of thing you put in a parenting agreement, not start springing demands about a year or more in.", "I didn't.  I'm saying it's better to avoid the situation altogether.  No one's accusing BIL of anything; it's simply a precaution.", "He is welcome all day and evening while everyone's awake.  Why would he need to be there when everyone's asleep, as long as he's not paying for the room?", "Right?! Poor wife and BIL are getting blindsided here.", "A year doesn\u2019t seem long to me to have worked out all the kinks. OP say\u2019s elsewhere on here that he\u2019s also allowed to have a say in who spends the night at exes house when his kids are there.

Wife shouldn\u2019t be making it about her vs me.", "Calm down sparky. No one said you couldn\u2019t have your opinion so chill. I\u2019m so glad your life has so wonderful that you don\u2019t have these concerns but for the rest of us not wanting your minor children in a house with an adult that you don\u2019t know is a very valid concern and he nor his ex really know this BIL.", "You cannot live in this world with this type of paranoia.", "I fully disagree. If you're a fit parent who has custody of their kids, it's not the co-parent's business if you invite your relative to stay over. They don't have to meet every person your kids ever come into contact with and if they don't trust your judgement as a parent to keep your kids safe, they need to take that up with court for a change in custody.", "Thats projection, seek some counseling.", "I don't think the op said this guy is a sex offender or that the kids would be home alone with them. Your comment goes 0 to 1000 real quick. The ex was out of line. This father can make decisions on who their child meets. The ex sounds controlling and unreasonable.", "The majority of sexual assaults are by people the victim knows.  As such, if the uncle were to assault one of the kids, it would be more likely that he assault his blood relative children rather than strangers.", "OldSillyGirl, I'm so sorry that happened to you. I may be going off off topic, but in the interest of a public service announcement, I recently learned that the sibling on sibling sexual abuse I experienced is three times as common as parent-child sex abuse. Everyone,  pay careful attention to what the kids are saying and doing, and how much time they are left alone together.", "Perhaps if the OP\u2019s wife had said \u201cBill is coming over, you know, my predatory, paedophile brother?\u201d that might have given the ex-wife cause for concern. \n \nSeeing as the OP does not mention this, and seeing it would be germane to the conversation, I think we can assume that the brother-in-law is not a predatory paedophile. \n\nIt might be a touch awkward for the BiL and the kids but, hey, that\u2019s life.", "I wouldn\u2019t for sure say permanently, but this dude needs to apologize big time to both his BIL and wife. Also brainstorming with wife on how to mend it. At the very least needs to pay a full round trip when/if BIL ever wants to visit.", "\u201cShe doesn\u2019t like my ex so I didn\u2019t talk to her before I kicked her brother out because my ex told me to.\u201d Surely that\u2019ll make her less irritated.", "Four days and he was planning to stay for three weeks", "Then OP should have taken his kids to a hotel.", "Usually", "This doesn\u2019t even make sense. \n\nThe time for lawyers is over. It was his custody time and he chose to kick out his BIL to appease his ex. That\u2019s basically saying \u201cMy kids mom thinks you\u2019re a pedophile and I agree.\u201d YTA", "Sorry but around here the lawyers would agree with her. Id set up a time where they can meet. Both parents have a right to be uncomfortable in this situation.", "We don't talk unless it's about the kids. The kids told her and she reached out to me to express discomfort.", "Dude a ton of co-parents do that for safety. It can even be used against them in court if they have essentially strangers going ariund the kids. It almost hauled to my bil, he broke up with the ex which was a good thing because he didn't know she was a pedo! There is. Reason why other parents would want to meet the new bf or gf.", "It depends on if they'll have opportunities to be alone with our kids.", "Such a weird conclusion to teach about a stranger!", "Not nearly as many as are abused by their fathers or step-fathers.", "But his wife hanst met him yet, and bil could still have red flags if he doesn't then it shouldn't be a problem when they meet and they can take worry off her shoulders. Shes not beinf spiteful and even family can hurt kids. She just wants to meet him first and that's not unreasonable.", "Not this parent. \n\n1. The majority of molestation happens within the family. 2. It\u2019s not HER fucking family. 3. The wife isn\u2019t even mature enough to have calm conversations about her husbands ex and coparents. Why would I trust her random brother?\n\nGTF over yourselves and protect your kids. How tf this isn\u2019t common sense is beyond me.", "No, it is not a reasonable request.", "She actually has zero say during his parenting time unless the children are in danger. And they were not. Just because she has mutual children doesn\u2019t mean she has the ability to run his household. Full stop.", "No thanks. I can share my opinions without your permission. I\u2019m actually quite calm. \n\nI never said that being cautious and having concerns weren\u2019t normal or acceptable. This, however, is paranoia. If the woman had met BIL briefly or even at length over a few hours it would have made zero difference if he had nefarious intentions. As a matter of fact, if he was the creep she was worried about she probably would have loved him. Because abusive people groom. And they groom the adults around children too. In case you were wondering if I know anything about the subject, I\u2019m actually quite familiar with the concerns and dangers and worked quite closely with social workers and victims for several years.", "I don't think you understand what that statistic means, maybe. The BIL would be classified as someone \"the children knows\" for the purpose of these large-scale generalisations. He's not a stranger jumping out from a bush, hence, per this \"standard\" he's someone the children know.", "Still doesn\u2019t mean that I would want my kids around a child molester, even if that molester only molests blood relatives", "It's not like BIL is being given solo time with OP's kids, and I say OP's kids because they're his kids just as much as mum's, he's got the same level of responsibility and care. By asking BIL to stay in a hotel he's basically called the man a nonce, I'd have flown home too in the same situation. What if it was a SIL? If that would have been acceptable then ex is being unjustifiably sexist.\n\nThough I agree the better compromise here would have been swapping weeks.", "Wowww he was going to stay there that long and you never once thought to plan ahead for it? I would be livid if my husband treated my brother this way. This would be unforgivable.", "Yeah, you really screwed up\u2026", "Holy cow YTA. So your wife got a few days with her brother that she rarely sees before you and your ex screwed that up for her? I don't think I'd ever forgive you, tbh.", "Nope. You can never be too careful. I was personally SA'd as a child by someone my mom thought she could trust. All my friends that also endured it thru someone their parents thought could be trusted. The statistics overwhelmingly back this up. I would do the do the same as the ex. Either he stays elsewhere or the kids aren't coming. Of course I would simply postpone the visit instead of completely cancelling, but still.", "It can be unreasonable but the \"I never met this man\" isnt unreasonable. Most people sonr want what is essentially a stranger around their kids. It doesn't matter that it's his weekend... That daid I don't blame him for being frustrated but ex just had to meet bil...", "Yes, but when does it end? How many meetings does the ex need to have with BIL? How long does she get to vet the family of the wife that\u2019s living there? And what does she get to decide? I have no proof he\u2019s a pedophile but I don\u2019t like him so he can\u2019t stay? Do we expect the person to admit to being a predator to mom?", "So it sounds like your wife is probably retaliating for what she sees as inappropriate restrictions on her.\n\nMany of the comments here mention your ex's unwillingness to trust your judgement and ability to keep your kids safe - it looks like you've set that precedent and she's following your lead.", "\"Go to a hotel, BIL, my ex hasn't confirmed whether or not you're a predator. No hard feelings tho.\" \n\nI'm aware you didn't say this with your mouth, but this is how your actions come across. Talk to your wife before making huge decisions *in her home too*, like she's, you know, your spouse or something.\n\nI feel so bad for her having to deal with all this, right after having a baby too...", "What?", "I\u2019m most definitely not reading all that. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\udc4d whatever you say. But I didn\u2019t get my panties bunched up over someone (not talking to me) expressing their opinion. But have a great day.", "> I wasn't saying he legally had to but if your ex is uncomfortable with an adult they haven't met staying jn the house with their child that does make sense to me!\n\nThe guy may be a stranger to the ex, but he is OP\u2019s brother-in-law. It\u2019s an unreasonable boundary for the ex to be allowed to draw.", "Then he should have at least offered to pay the whole hotel room", "If the guy was someone who has sexually assault people before then I\u2019m right there with you. Even if he was generally creepy/shady then I\u2019d get that too. \n\nIt\u2019s pretty obvious that most people aren\u2019t rapists/molesters; and most people wouldn\u2019t appreciate being treated as one either.  Life is going to be hard for you if this is how you treat everyone you don\u2019t know (and in this case both parents know this guy- so that standard doesn\u2019t even make sense)", "So you would let your ex decide who you can and can\u2019t date?", "So you believe that when a couple with kids get divorced, each of them should get to veto each other\u2019s future partners forevermore?", "I understood that, but you can't just assume everybody's a rapist and make people act the way, again that's excessivly controlling behaviour.\n\nYou can't just act like that and not expect repercussions from the people you involve in that kind of behaviour and people feeding into it aren't helping.\n\nTeach kids how to handle situations they don't want to be in, you can't keep them away from harm 24\\7, but you can teach them how to get out safely.", "So ex meets the guy as you suggest. To your point your mother knew the person who molested you. So her knowing him and having an opinion of him was absolutely worthless. She knew him and still molested you. She wasn't the all powerful ,OZ who was able to protect you. Why would this mother be any different. Why is she somehow more capable than the father of determining if someone is safe? Seems pretty sexist especially when your mother failed you.\nYou are proof positive that the mother knowing someone doesn't matter, and that unless you want to lock children up and never meet anyone there will always be some minimal level of risk.", "No she didn\u2019t. They have a custody agreement and she has no legal right to deny him time with the kids or to make such demands.", "Scrolled way to far down to find this comment. OPs ex must have super powers or something if she can tell exactly what a person is going to after meeting them for half an hour, I\u2019m sure even a raging alcoholic can be on their best behaviour for that long and she wouldn\u2019t know. OP and his ex are both AH and the only solution would have been is for them to swap weekends since OP has no backbone to stand up to his ex.", "Not a stranger. And kids get molested by people parents think are safe. This is controlling. If it was some random stranger, sure, but this wreaks of controlling and manipulativeness. What happens if she says I don't want BIL  around the kids ever? Then what? What about grandparents? Is she trained to detect/figure out who molesters are? I doubt it.", "Op shouldnt have invited him during that time in the first place. It was rude but the ex isn't wrong.", "All that. It\u2019s a paragraph. Jesus.", "The mother of your children who they spend the vast majority of the time with isn't a stranger and I think it's fair they get a say in who their kids associate with, legal backing or not. Even if they were a stranger when you got pregnant there's no way they are staying like that if you're both jn your kids lives", "Oh yeah definitely. The way he dealt with the situation was terrible for sure", "Clearly, I didn't think this through. Probably naive of me but I thought me dating wouldn't automatically expose my children to the new person. In that hypothetical situation, I would put a lot of thought and time into deciding when to introduce them, let alone them spending a night under the same roof. And if a relationship did get to that level (all hypotheticals), I like to think that I would listen if my ex raised any valid concerns. But yes as everyone on this thread has pointed out, I am way out of my depth in these type of situations so I would like to bow out.", "Fair points all.", "But you just said you can't easily identify predators. So what gives? I feel like I'm missing something here. Meeting people for a sleepover let's you detect if they're drunks druggies etc. If you can't trust your coparent to handle noticing things like that, the answer is to seek full custody, not control your ex's life.", "Should the ex also get to decide if OP\u2019s partner is acceptable? After all, OP\u2019s partner is a stranger to her initially.\n\nThe more reasonable position is to trust each other to make sensible decisions about the children when they are in each respective parent\u2019s custody, unless there\u2019s some kind of orange flag that suggests otherwise.", "That\u2019s not how it works at all. Even if you would like to argue that it should work that way from an ethical standpoint, there are exactly zero legal grounds for that standard.  Nor should there be, because then any jealous ex spouse would be able to prevent the other parent from ever bringing anyone around their kids.", "I know anyone can be a predator. Teachers, uncles/aunts, grandparents and of course the stranger who lures the children with sweets. But to accuse everyone in the world of that is insane. A one-time meeting will not deter a pedophile person. On the outside you can always present yourself differently. And what does it mean to know some on. Don't you ever want your child to go on school trips? I understand when you say one of the two parents. But both is crazy", "Yea but this isn't 'am I breaking the law' is it?"]}
