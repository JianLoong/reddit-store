She has every right to let her brother stay but he has no right to ask that he leave for a very reasonable reason?", "OP said that the BIL was supposed to \"come back\" today and they didn't even notice that he was already gone, so no, he didn't ask him to just sleep in a hotel, he asked him not to set his feet in his house while his kids were there.", "DING DING DING\n\nThis isn't a few hours at the family cookout.

This isn't a \"very reasonable reason\" Anyways but you don't tell someone they can come stay with you and then after a few days be like \"oh yeah, you can't stay anymore because my ex hasn't met you.\" That's not reasonable at all.

I would never let my daughter stay in a home with someone I don\u2019t know or trust. It\u2019s not even about meeting them. A hi and bye would not change my stance on this in the least bit.

The woman was in his children's life well before the newborn.\n\nIf the woman you send your children to every so often is trustworthy enough to not kick up a fuss about, so is her family.\n\nSaying otherwise is incredibly sexist.", "So it's more reasonable to make the guy leave they told was welcome and could stay there than it is to expect the ex just to come meet the guy if that's what she wants? Really?", "I mean how entitled is the ex really? She didn't make an attempt to meet the guy, she didn't offer to switch weekends, she just says he needs to make the guy leave because she hasn't met him. And he just does.

That's how the world is unfortunately.", "He's not even really leaving, or at least wasn't supposed to; he was just sleeping elsewhere.

He probably just nodded along with the ex and then tried to make it BIL's problem and not his own.", "No indication as to how long they\u2019ve been coparenting.

What makes her such a better judge of character then everyone else?", "Eh, see what makes this feel manipulative to me is they've obviously been divorced for a good long while for OP to be remarried with a new baby. So if this is important to the ex why hasn't it been brought up before? If i had young kids i could see myself wanting to know who they are around and i would bring that up when we were making the parenting agreement and make sure we're both on the same page with that. But instead of raising this issue in the previous year or more, the ex waits until the new wife's brother is visiting and demands he leave. That sounds more like she's pissy about the new baby and him moving on than she legit has an issue with her kids being around people she doesn't know.", "He was made to leave his sisters home where he was told he was welcome and could stay. That absolutely is an issue. Especially when it was far from the only solution to this.", "Oh i agree OP sucks the most, lol. I can't even imagine being the wife who found out after the fact that her brother was asked to leave her home because the ex didn't want him there.", "They've obviously been coparenting for close to or over a year for OP to be remarried with a new baby. This is the kind of thing you put in a parenting agreement, not start springing demands about a year or more in.", "I didn't.  I'm saying it's better to avoid the situation altogether.  No one's accusing BIL of anything; it's simply a precaution.", "He is welcome all day and evening while everyone's awake.  Why would he need to be there when everyone's asleep, as long as he's not paying for the room?", "Right?! Poor wife and BIL are getting blindsided here.", "A year doesn\u2019t seem long to me to have worked out all the kinks. OP say\u2019s elsewhere on here that he\u2019s also allowed to have a say in who spends the night at exes house when his kids are there.

Who are you married to????? \n\n\"He didn't even talk to her before making this impulsive decision\" - UMMM, did you consult your wife???? \n\nThis was YOUR weekend with the kids, why on earth did you allow some other woman to ruin it. Do you know how insulted your brother in law must feel right now. Do you know how this is going to affect your entire relationship with your in laws. \n\nYour decision was very foolish and you're about to pay for it. Meanwhile, your ex is sipping on martinis because she achieved what she set out to do.", "YTA.", "NTA", "Tips for a \u201csuccessful\u201d 2nd marriage.\n\nObey the ex-wife\n\nIgnore the current wife\n\nLol. YTA", "YTA. You unilaterally decided to make decisions because your ex cracked the whip and you folded like a cheap suit. Wow. Good luck on your next marriage.", "YTA", "Say to your ex that the kids don't have to come they could stay with her if she doesn't trust your judgment as a parent. \nYTA there were lots of options and kicking someone out isn't one of them. Moving forward just don't invite anyone ever again.", "ESH\n\nIt's perfectly reasonable for your ex to not what some stranger staying with her children, surely an easier solution would have been to swap when your kids come to stay with you? \n\nBIL shouldn't have thrown a tantrum about the whole thing though, which is why I went with ESH.", "YTA. It\u2019s great that OP is trying to co-parent well, but I think the ex is copping too much of the blame in this situation, and too much judgement is being assigned to the exes stance on \u201cstrangers\u201d around the children.\n\nOP really dropped the ball on communication with everyone involved here. And if I was BIL, I would have left for home as well.", "At every possible chance to communicate and resolve this amicably, OP has made exactly the wrong choice. \n\nYTA. Not a malicious one, but one with no clue how to navigate a relationship.", "Or he could have took his kids and had a slumber party with them in a hotel room. That way wife gets to spend time with her brother, the brother isn\u2019t inconvenienced & he spends time making fun memories with his kids.", "Not only throwing money at him, initially threw 1/2!  Insult to injury!  **smdh", "I'm not saying you're a monster but umm here's some money so you can go sleep somewhere else. No no I know it sounds like I'm saying you're a danger to children but nope I'm not, I'm just saying I can't have you around my kids.", "Oh please. The ex is just controlling is all. That is OPs brother in law not some weirdo picked up off the streets.", "I am not sure about that. I will be wary of my minor kids spending time around a stranger (to me) without me around. In the ex's position, I would have exchanged one of my weekends for one of his when the BIL wasn't around so I have the kids with me when he's there. Maybe its just mom anxiety but better be an asshole than a possibility that your kids get hurt.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo ESH for the ex not to have kept the kids with her if she had objections and prior knowledge of the visit and the OP for disrespecting his current marriage.", "Why are you consulting your ex before your wife? You're letting your ex manipulate you.", "Then she shouldn\u2019t have gotten divorced\u2026", "You do realise though that you low key accused him of being a potential predator, right?\n\nLike, in acquiescing to her demand that no \u201cstrange man\u201d stay in a home where her children are instead of vouching for him and then offering a brief introduction, you\u2019re saying there may be merit to her concerns.\n\nRegardless of whether or not that was your intent, that was the message you gave him.\n\nAnd I don\u2019t blame him for leaving.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t want to be around someone who all but outright said \u201cyeah, I couldn\u2019t be bothered telling my ex you\u2019re not a kiddy diddler\u201d.", "Then don\u2019t get divorced! \n\nI don\u2019t know what to tell you, but you don\u2019t have control over who stays at your ex\u2019s house. Unless your ex is a spineless doormat like OP\u2026", "I found the ex", "What about any partners family members of your ex would you expect that too? YTA you should have discussed this with your wife first and if your ex has an issue agreed to move your kid\u2019s visit!", "A newborn that she pushed out of her body, not him. She probably wanted HER family there for some moral support while OP is too busy sucking up to his ex-wife. If I was her, I'd be going to get OP started in divorce #2.", "Yeah, sorry, but no. Having family guests stay the night occasionally is not some alien thing. It\u2019s not up to ex. Ex has no say, and no right to meet these people. Unless there\u2019s some reason to believe this person is a danger to the kids, OP is completely within their rights and responsibilities to just parent as they see fit during their time. Ex can be as uncomfortable as they want to be, but that\u2019s their problem.", "What? I mean I would get it if it was a stranger or somebody with a criminal background, but now you would have to make your ex-wife meet your new partner's whole family in case of a family get together?  \nThat's reeeally unrealistic and sounds like obsessive behaviour over fear of loosing control.", "I agree. I can kind of understand your ex with the fact she had never met him. But he is your BIL and your family now as well. Your BIL seems to be very interested in your child and maybe he even want to get his step nieces/nephews as well on this trip. By instantly agreeing with your ex, even though you know your BIL, OP comes across as not knowing his BIL. You could or say that you know him very well and that you trust him with your children or BIL and ex could meet when kids are dropped off. You now pushed away your BIL who want to be a uncle for your kids.", "No it's not. It's entirely irrational. You can't decide that your co-parent's judgment when it comes to their family is not good enough, and you can't decide who stays at your ex's house. That's just ridiculous.", "I wouldn\u2019t want my kid to be in a house with a man I don\u2019t know, as well. OP should have anticipated this.", "But OP has the same vision (he meets all of the guests). We are all good and without boundaries and worries... in theory. But then in real life many ex partners just don't trust their children vulnerable at night with unknown people. As a consequence, they want at least to meet the other guests. Or more simply, avoiding the situation directly (this is a situation very, very easily \"easy to circumnavigate\": the guest stay in hotel and has thr whole daytime to be with the family).", "No, it's fear of child abuse when you aren't even in the same house and the other parents are sleeping... As I wrote, we are all good with words but at the end of the day, OP (and many divorcees) do the same. Many adults fear this dynamic and try to avoid it as much as possible, or at least knowing the guests before.", "Then OP should have communicated to his ACTUAL CURRENT WIFE who just had a newborn baby and wanted her brother there, and the BIL, that he'd prefer if he stayed in a hotel from the start. And, of course, fucking paid for it in it's entirety.", "It's not stranger, it's his wife brother", "I agree with that. He failed in the communication department and he/they should have offered to pay for his hotel stay. But it's his fault, not her ex being crazy or possessive.", "At this rate of OP pretending the only parties that have to be on the know of things are him and his ex, he's gonna be onto divorce #2 soon."]}
