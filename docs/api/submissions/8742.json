Then without warning, you're told to leave because you're not to be trusted at night around the children, but here's some money, that'll make everything better. Are you telling me you wouldn't be insulted?", "He's an unknown rando to the kids' mom.\n\nBoth parents in this situation vet the guys who will be around their kids.", "Sure, I guess he could have left his wife with their newborn son and uprooted his kids. Her brother DID stay there for some of his trip. She has every right to let her brother stay but he has no right to ask that he leave for a very reasonable reason?", "OP said that the BIL was supposed to \"come back\" today and they didn't even notice that he was already gone, so no, he didn't ask him to just sleep in a hotel, he asked him not to set his feet in his house while his kids were there.", "DING DING DING\n\nThis isn't a few hours at the family cookout. This is knowing a stranger is a few doors down while your young children are sleeping and vulnerable.", "So her own family is treated with this suspicion?? If we follow that logic chain", "Your wife's sibling that you trust enough to come spend multiple nights with your newborn isn't a stranger.", "Rando to her.  And it's not like pervs don't have family members or that those family members know their hidden proclivities.  \n\nNo, I most definitely would NOT be insulted, aside from the monetary issue.  I've encountered these pervs before and understand why a responsible parent could be concerned.", "In that vein, so is OPs current wife.", "Nope, sorry. That's just not how it works. She has zero actual say in what happens when he has his time with the kids but I'd be with her if there was an actual reason behind it other than \"she hasn't met him.\"", "No. He doesn't. This isn't a \"very reasonable reason\" Anyways but you don't tell someone they can come stay with you and then after a few days be like \"oh yeah, you can't stay anymore because my ex hasn't met you.\" That's not reasonable at all. His response to the ex should have been \"then come meet him because we've already made these arrangements.\"", "Well every abuser belongs to a family of some sort, so I don\u2019t see a parent wanting to know, or at the very least meet, the people who will be *spending the night* in the same home as their child as unreasonable.", "To the ex he is. OP is a bad communicator, he should have spoken to his ex beforehand and introduced them if she was happy with that, otherwise he should have nominated another weekend for BIL to stay.", "The risk from a woman, while it does exist, is rather small compared to males...especially from the mother of a newborn.", "They're co-parenting for the good of the kids; both vet guys who will be around their kids overnight.  That's how it works.", "She has zero say in the execution. But I support her voicing her concerns.\n\nThe real failure was not ironing out all these details before BIL's visit and getting husband & wife on the same page.", "Yeah, it really is though. I would never let my daughter stay in a home with someone I don\u2019t know or trust. It\u2019s not even about meeting them. A hi and bye would not change my stance on this in the least bit. I\u2019m 100% positive that OP is obliging as he wants the same courtesy from his ex if the situation were ever reversed. As he should. Nothing supersedes doing everything in your power to keep your kids safe.", "But then everyone else is saying it\u2019s hard to tell who would be a predator. How many meetings does she require? Will he ever be trusted?", "And if you look down in the comments, OP didn't even talk to his actual WIFE first...", "Please. The woman was in his children's life well before the newborn.\n\nIf the woman you send your children to every so often is trustworthy enough to not kick up a fuss about, so is her family.\n\nSaying otherwise is incredibly sexist.", "So it's more reasonable to make the guy leave they told was welcome and could stay there than it is to expect the ex just to come meet the guy if that's what she wants? Really?", "I mean how entitled is the ex really? She didn't make an attempt to meet the guy, she didn't offer to switch weekends, she just says he needs to make the guy leave because she hasn't met him. And he just does. That's pretty fucked up.", "That absolutely was an error. I mean, why didn't the ex just bring the kids and meet the BIL then if that was the issue?", "Except him and his ex don't have this agreement. If they did he could have planned accordingly. If this is an arrangement two parents want to agree on that's one thing, but for one parent to just jump in and say \"make the guy leave!\" is bullshit.", "That\u2019s up to the parent frankly and something I can\u2019t answer. You may never know unfortunately and if it were easy to tell the world would be a lot safer but it\u2019s not. Sometimes things happen but a parent often just wants a reassurance by meeting or knowing someone and given he was spending the night this isn\u2019t unreasonable. It\u2019s not a bbq where everyone is around he will be sleeping in the same home, it\u2019s a completely different environment and a vulnerable one for a child. It sucks to think that way but this happens all the time.", "Which is why I said he\u2019s a bad communicator. It\u2019s his fault, not his ex\u2019s.", ">If the woman you send your children to every so often is trustworthy enough to not kick up a fuss about, so is her family.\n\nAbsolutely not.  I've known women who are perfectly trustworthy but have a blind spot where their creepy SOs or relatives are concerned.  I spotted one of those well before the others pieced it together.", "That might be preferable but neither is a bad option AFAIC.  I really wouldn't have a problem if I were in the BIL's place.  That's how the world is unfortunately.", "He's not even really leaving, or at least wasn't supposed to; he was just sleeping elsewhere.  He would have missed nothing but the cries of a hungry newborn in the middle of the night.  Being expected to pay for half of the hotel is the only real issue I see.", "OP sounds conflict avoidant and bad at communicating. \n\nHe already admitted in another comment he didn't tell his wife because she doesn't like when he brings up his ex who he shares custody with! So he went straight to BIL instead of dealing with his spouse and his ex first. He probably just nodded along with the ex and then tried to make it BIL's problem and not his own.", "No indication as to how long they\u2019ve been coparenting. I\u2019m assuming new situations arise regularly that coparents need to navigate. Dude should have offered to pay for his hotel in full right off the bat for sure. But again, his ex is totally justified.", "So you're saying the ex has better judgement than the kids dad or stepmother. Why? What makes her such a better judge of character then everyone else?", "Eh, see what makes this feel manipulative to me is they've obviously been divorced for a good long while for OP to be remarried with a new baby. So if this is important to the ex why hasn't it been brought up before? If i had young kids i could see myself wanting to know who they are around and i would bring that up when we were making the parenting agreement and make sure we're both on the same page with that. But instead of raising this issue in the previous year or more, the ex waits until the new wife's brother is visiting and demands he leave. That sounds more like she's pissy about the new baby and him moving on than she legit has an issue with her kids being around people she doesn't know.", "He was made to leave his sisters home where he was told he was welcome and could stay. That absolutely is an issue. Especially when it was far from the only solution to this.", "Oh i agree OP sucks the most, lol. I can't even imagine being the wife who found out after the fact that her brother was asked to leave her home because the ex didn't want him there.", "They've obviously been coparenting for close to or over a year for OP to be remarried with a new baby. This is the kind of thing you put in a parenting agreement, not start springing demands about a year or more in.", "I didn't.  I'm saying it's better to avoid the situation altogether.  No one's accusing BIL of anything; it's simply a precaution.", "He is welcome all day and evening while everyone's awake.  Why would he need to be there when everyone's asleep, as long as he's not paying for the room?", "Right?! Poor wife and BIL are getting blindsided here.", "A year doesn\u2019t seem long to me to have worked out all the kinks. OP say\u2019s elsewhere on here that he\u2019s also allowed to have a say in who spends the night at exes house when his kids are there. Not knowing how far in advance BIL planned his trip or let them know he was coming in combo with being sleep deprived parent to a newborn, OP should have communicated better obviously but BIL should be able to see where the ex is coming from."]}
