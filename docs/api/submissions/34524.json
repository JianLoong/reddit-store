We have never flown together and if the airline screwed up our seats it would be a little crushing not to sit together.  It would be such a huge moment in our toddlers life that neither of us would want to miss.  Flying is the norm for some, but for others it is a very rare or once in a lifetime event.

So definitely NTA here.\n\nAnd I can say that with a very light conscious because I have been the parent traveling with a small child, while my husband got seated elsewhere during our connection flight that was 3 hours long.
