We have never flown together and if the airline screwed up our seats it would be a little crushing not to sit together.  It would be such a huge moment in our toddlers life that neither of us would want to miss.  Flying is the norm for some, but for others it is a very rare or once in a lifetime event.

It\u2019s called having morals and in todays world everything is me me me no one stops to think about anyone else.

As a father I would have been pissed to. The only thing I can say your selfish defense is they should have realized the seats were messed up and asked upon check in if it could be fixed. Don\u2019t listen to these other people selfishly saying NTA because honestly you could have thought of someone else and made that child\u2019s day instead you caused anger and resentment.
