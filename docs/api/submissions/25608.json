I was at the gate and was doing my checks when the sweetest woman came to me with her service dog. It was the calmest dog ever and she was small as well really cute. The passenger asked me if she could get an aisle seat because of her dog and explained that she couldn't reserve it due to extra checks because of her dog. I looked and I saw I had 2 seats open one middle and one aisle. I gave her the seat and told her she could use the other one as well so her dog could sit on it. The woman even asked me if I wanted to pet her dog but I declined cause I knew the dog was working and working dogs are not to be pet.\n\nI saw that a kid constantly came to pet the dog even though the woman said no. The parents didn't do anything. I walked up to the parents and asked them to tell their kid to stop because service dogs can't be pet when working. The mom told me to mind my own fking business and that it is just a dog. I have addressed this another 3 times with the parents and they again told me \"you are just an employee so do your work and leave us alone\". I told them that I am doing my work and their son should stop they said ok. (turns out the seat I gave the owner was 1 row before this family).\n\nSo while boarding I see the kid looking at the dog and walking up to it. I gave the parents one final warning and told them \"if this behavior does not stop and I hear or see your son trying to pet the dog one more time I'll get all of you off the flight before the door even closes\". I had told the cabin crew at this point and yupp after boarding I go on board to do my last checks and the cabin attendant tells me she has warned the parents and they won't do anything. I walked up to the owner of the dog and could clearly see she was uncomfortable. I walked up to the parents and asked them to leave the plane. They obviously refused and I told them \"I warned you multiple times and you still won't listen. So we can either do this the easy way you just get off the plane or I will have to get security and you can spend the rest of your day explaining them why it was so hard to tell your kid that service dogs aren't to be pet\".\n\nThey got off the flight and told me they haven't been on vacation for 5 years and I just ruined it for them and that I should be ashamed. They said I could have just changed the seat of the owner and it didn't have to be a big deal. I am wondering AITA for taking them off the flight?\n\nEdit: guys the owner did complain otherwise I wouldn't have gone to the parents. Also in the aircraft the owner was asking the parents to keep their child away from her dog and she was at the edge of having a panic attack. You could clearly see that she was uncomfortable. The family was removed and the decision was made by me the flight officer and the purser.

They have been warned and refused to listen.", "NTA and good for you!!!", "NTA\n\nI get that little kids sometimes don't obey, when tempted with something as awesome as a dog, but the parents did not even TRY.

I also walked up to her in the plane like I said in my story. A service dog is not to be pet and can not be pet by anyone. These are the well known rules. A woman who was at the edge of having a panic attack. Also an aviation rule. Gate agent and flight officer have the last say at the gate and purser and captain have the last say on the aircraft itself.

I gave them one last chance and they still couldn't behave in the aircraft so they were removed.", "She writes in there that she did tell them not pet the dog.", "Imo It's less about the service dog,and more about a passenger harrasing another passenger.", "why?", "Not really.  You are at 35000 feet when you hit turbulence.  Captain turns on seatbelt sign.  Kid is running up and down the aisle constantly, not on the way to/from the toilet.  You think the parents are going to respond INSTANTLY when the flight crew asks them to?  \n\nThe time to question instructions from the flight crew is after the plane lands and all passengers have left the plane.  If you're already giving the crew grief and the flight hasn't taken off yet?  Yeah, you get the boot.  And the other passengers breathe a sigh of relief.", "I agree with you.", "I wasted my time googling your assertions about airlines and service dogs and can unequivocally state that you are making this nonsense up.", "This whole story is fiction. \n\nAnyone who's flown before knows the gate attendant isn't allowed on the plane. This onboard confrontation is impossible.", "They were on the ground in the airport.", "The gate agent is always allowed on the plane to do her last checks if needed. May change per airline but all the airlines I work with this is allowed. However you are not allowed to make decisions on the aircraft itself. The decision to remove the passengers were made by the purser flight officer and me. I only explained the situation that they were warned 3 times before boarding the plane. The final call was made by the cabin crew", "Doesn't matter.  It's not like someone will grow a brain simply by boarding an aircraft.  If they were identified as a  problem BEFORE boarding, that's even better, actually."]}
