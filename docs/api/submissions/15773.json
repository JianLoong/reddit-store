You tried baking what you wanted when you wanted to, and he complained because he has no self-control and ends up eating something he feels he shouldn't.  You found a good compromise.  The only other option is for you to not bake what you want at all, which would mean that he expects you to deprive yourself of what you want because he refuses to control himself, which is unfair and selfish on his part.  You found a way to indulge in what you want without tempting him, and he's being unfair for saying you were wrong to do it.  If he wanted to know when you bake, he shouldn't have complained when you were baking and letting him know before.", "NTA this is some brownies, not drugs. You shouldn't have to stop baking things when you enjoy it because he lacks self-control. You found the middle ground.

Total amateur move. \n\nSeriously I think yours was a reasonable strategy but you need to be a little more effective. And find a better hiding spot. A cupboard?

I\u2019m guessing not often.", "NAH.\n\nMaybe I\u2019m misreading, but this sounds wholesome and cute. \n\nHe loves your baking, so much so he just has to have some. How dare you tempt him with delicious treats! And how dare you hide them when you do make them! \n\nI feel like he\u2019s more upset that you felt you needed to hide things because of his last reaction. \n \nBeing new parents is tough too! I\u2019m sure you are both tired. \n\nBut this doesn\u2019t seem like something two people should fight about. Take a step back and cool off.

He found and ate the ones in the cupboard. He also complained to me again. I told him, his self control was not my problem, it was/is his problem. I will make and buy what I enjoy eating as I don\u2019t go overboard. I also remind him how much I love him and his weight didn\u2019t bother me. I recommended he consider going for long walks everyday and/or exercising, if he didn\u2019t want to adjust his diet. Needless to say after being a broken record, for awhile, he stopped complaining about the baking. And I really mean, I just repeated the same thing over and over.
