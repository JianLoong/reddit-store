I will make and buy what I enjoy eating as I don\u2019t go overboard. I also remind him how much I love him and his weight didn\u2019t bother me. I recommended he consider going for long walks everyday and/or exercising, if he didn\u2019t want to adjust his diet. Needless to say after being a broken record, for awhile, he stopped complaining about the baking. And I really mean, I just repeated the same thing over and over.

He wanted her to stop baking because he lacks self control.  She enjoys baking.  Sound relationships aren't founded on control, selfishness and emotional manipulation.\n\nShe stopped having the sweets out where they could tempt him.  He isn't upset about her still baking.  He's upset because she still gets to eat sweets and he doesn't.

My husband is working hard to lose weight. I've been breastfeeding for over a year and really like cookies for my late night pumps.

I'm gonna go in the bedroom for 2 minutes and when I come out it would be super cool if there were a few of whatever you've got on a plate\". If they're just there he'd eat what usually lasts me a month in a few days. \n\nShe's not lying, and he's being immature. She's allowed to still enjoy things, away from him while still supporting his needs, even though he's struggling with them. He's being immature and selfish.", "You sound like a controlling misogynist. She does not need to heed every one of his wishes, especially when they're so stupid and she has found a solution for them both to have what they want. It's called compromise.", "Of course she has to do what her husband says. He\u2019s the man after all /s", "But she wasn't eating in front of him. And she answered truthfully.", "Right.  I said she shouldn\u2019t, which she isn\u2019t, as in if she had been then he\u2019d have a reason to be upset but she isn\u2019t doing that.  She did tell the truth when confronted, however the original omission would bother me a little bit but that\u2019s my own standard for relationships.  Clearly the husband is the real AH for being so controlling that he expects her to stop baking."]}
