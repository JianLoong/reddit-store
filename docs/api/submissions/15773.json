I may have the unpopular opinion here but just to give some perspective: when a partner you live with is dieting - it seems like you would try to support them in some way.   \n\n\nFirst of all, hiding it from your partner - like, hiding the actual brownies - must have been very humiliating for him. Food (and sex) should not be used as a weapon or malicious compliance. If my partner hid food from me, it would make me feel like they viewed me as some glutinous pig. How am I supposed to feel supported to lose weight by someone who's treating me like that? He told you to stop baking because he thought cold turkey would be the easiest way. And most people do when dieting. They think, \"Okay tomorrow, I'm eating only salads and water and chicken!\" but then it gets boring and they crave and then eventually, cheat the diet. It never works. It's okay to have things in *moderation.* When he said to stop, you decided to get petty and \"stop\".  \n\n\nWhy not express your needs rather than hide them in a fucking cupboard? And tell him to express his as well. Honestly, I don't know why your first thought was to play games with him instead of talking. \"Honey, I love to bake and I don't want to give it up. I know how much you love my desserts and I'm willing to work with you but you will be responsible for your own eating habits. I know you can do it, and one day you won't be so tempted to over-indulge because you'll find joy in other stuff.\"   \n\n\nBestie, there are so many low fat/sugar, healthier dessert recipes out there. You don't even have to go that route but you could maybe cut back to making a dessert *once a month (maybe twice during holidays).* Now it gets to be special. And I think that's important to you because obviously you get a hit of dopamine every time you bake and get to share it. Just like he gets a hit when he eats it. So how about, we spend a week looking up recipes, a week gathering ingredients, and on the third week we get an extra special dessert that is maybe indulgent but small in quantity, and the next time healthier larger dessert to last a few days? Make whatever dessert but offer to go on a 30min walk with him after every time. IT AINT HARD.   \n\n\nMaybe its just me but I think it could have been handled better.

NTA", "NTA. Your husband is an adult and in charge of his own diet intake. You already went out of your way to remove temptation from in front of his face while still doing something you enjoy. He needs to take some responsibility here.", "NTA. You did stop baking. For him. He can't ask you to stop doing something for yourself if that doesn't affect him.", "Urm.. NTA at all. \n\nIf he wants to loose weight he needs to do the work and resist the temptation to eat things he knows are not good for him. \n\nI've literally not eaten any sweet treats or crisps now for nearly 11 weeks but people are still allowed to keep 'naughties' in their house/make anything they want? Just cause I am not eating it, doesn't mean I control the food in the house as well...", "NTA. He said that he didn't want the temptation of the brownies. You removed the temptation of the brownies. He can't complain when you do the thing he asked you to do because he can't manage his own impulses.", "Should have just told him you weren\u2019t going to stop instead of \u201cstopping\u201d", "He\u2019s the one that\u2019s immature can\u2019t control himself and blames you for that", "NTA. I struggled with my self control so when I was losing weight I asked my husband to put the biscuit jar somewhere I didn't know about rather than by the kettle so I wasn't tempted when making tea. He still gets biscuits and for me they are out of sight out of mind. Win win", "NTA. Your husband is acting like a child. You were being a supportive partner by keeping the brownies (temptation) away from him after he stated he didn\u2019t want to eat sweets anymore. He is not allowed to dictate what you can and can\u2019t eat.", "NTA, You should\u2019ve talked about this with him maybe and found a better solutiom rather than straight up lying, but yeah broski needa learn sum self control", "NTA. As someone who will have been married for 20 years in August, not all hills are worth dying on in a marriage. In the grand scheme of your life, your child, parenting, mental health, etc. hiding baked goods is not a big deal. Your heart was in the right place because he expressed not wanting to be tempted, so you didn\u2019t tempt him. He\u2019s just salty cause he wants the sweets and feels left out. But he brought this on himself.", "I feel like you're NTA outright. I just think that you should talk to him about it more seriously. Lying is never right and I think maybe you should apologize for it (although you were doing it for his sake). Have a conversation with him and tell him how much you value him keeping with his diet but that you also would like to continue your passion for cooking and baking. In your conversation, see if there is a compromise or solution that you both can land on regarding this.", "Comparing people who love sugar to rapists now, huh", "not everything revolves around her husband she wants to bake for herself", "hold up when did she lie though? when he found it she said the truth she never lied to him she was hiding it because he told her to stop baking", "Lmao please re-read my comment, I only compared the logic behind both because it\u2018s in fact similar: trying to exert control over a person, restricting them in their passions, because one cannot control their urges.\n\nMan could\u2018ve said: \u201eI have difficulties restricting myself from eating sugar, could you please keep the baked goods out of my eye-sight?\u201c. Instead he said: \u201eStop doing something you enjoy\u201c.", "You've entirely hit the nail on the head, bravo!", "Mother fucker, she baked because she enjoys sweets. The fuck out of here with that nonsense.", "Its also not fair to ask her to give up a hobby to compensate for his personal failure though. \n\nShe's also not technically lying. His request was that she stop making baked goods available to him and she did.", "That's always bullshit. If you can't watch someone do X without losing your own self control, you need therapy. And if we're talking alcoholics, you need to ditch AA and do real therapy because AA can't help you if you still haven't developed self-control after 10 years of sessions. \n\nIt's not upon the people around you to stop their normal behavior to accommodate your pathological behavior. It's upon you to actually examine the pathology and do something about it.", "BRO. WHAT THE FUCK. STOP DOING WHAT YOU LOVE CUZ YOUR WIFE TOLD YOU THEN. YEAH GO AHEAD.
