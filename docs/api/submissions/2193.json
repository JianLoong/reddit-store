Like thinking your friends definitely won't come to the party. And not wanting to see your friends for your birthday in the first place. \n\nIf your anxiety and \"social awkwardness\" (in conjunction with what sounds like a double whammy of an intense parenting role and an overbearing mother) is causing you to dread the idea of social gatherings or to not want to go out with friends, then IMHO, you need more support. You need it for yourself, but also for the whole \"put your own mask on first\" part of parenting your child.\n\nThe fact that you mentioned your anxiety does suggest you are already self-aware, and maybe have already seen or are seeing a mental health professional about it, so apologies if I am pointing out the obvious.", "Are you in a position to go LC/NC with her if she tends to prioritise her needs in a selfish way?", "Just tell her you won't be there and ignore the inevitable sulking.", "That's very unfortunate, sorry to hear she's not of much help \ud83d\ude0f", "Two of my friends work on Saturday and I know in their jobs that it is hard to get the time off, especially on a Saturday. They have families too and with my birthday being so close to Christmas, it is hard to find the time and funds to go out to celebrate. We always get together just before Christmas to celebrate all of our birthdays together (8th Nov, 23rd Nov, 22nd Dec) so I'm not worried about that aspect.\n\nYou are right in everything else you are saying though and I am getting help, just got to work through it for the sake of myself and my son. I appreciate the concern and the fact that your head/heart means well. We shouldn't shy away from talking about our mental health so thank you :)", "It seems that since my mum got her new BF, she has been distancing herself from us anyway but I see your point. I'll take it into consideration."]}
