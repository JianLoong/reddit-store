His grandmother was friends with the family back then and that\u2019s the only reason he has the photo and when I told him that if he\u2019s ever thinking about giving it away in the future to consider giving it to me he told me he doesn\u2019t plan on giving it away at all. For some reason that got me really upset cause he thinks just cause it was his grandmother\u2019s he shouldn\u2019t give some of the actual photos to the actual family. There will be a time when he passes away and someone will get that photo and I don\u2019t get how anyone like his kids will ever appreciate the photo other than the actual descendants of the family so I just completely stoped talking to him and I\u2019m just so upset about it. \n\nHe scanned it and sent it to me but it\u2019s not the same as getting the original and the little imperfections of the photo through age not being felt by hand just makes it bad.
