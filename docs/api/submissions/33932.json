Probably will be done in spring of 2025. 2025 is also our 10 year anniversary so I\u2019m saving for a trip to Europe plus a house! (We are both saving for the house but I save for the travel). \n\nThat\u2019s the context. \n\nSo my MIL wants to take us and husbands sister and her kids and husband all on a vacation every other year at Christmas. The idea is that they pay for the hotel/food and we pay for the flights. Well, flights at Christmas are double what they are any other time. So that\u2019s not a cheap ask of us. We did this last year and flights were $2500!\n\nThe reason? MIL and FIL had a conversation with my husband and his sister (before I was on the scene and edit: I never knew about this conversation. No travel during Covid but now things are back in full swing) and asked if they wanted an inheritance or if they wanted family memories, which apparently mean a ton of family vacations (that we have to pay a chunk of). They aren\u2019t crazy rich or anything but have very good pensions and some retirement savings. \n\nWe went to Mexico last Christmas together. The airline changed our flights so I missed my family\u2019s Christmas and I got super sick. Not so fun. \n\nSo this Christmas rolls around and they start talking about next years trip!! They want to go Jan 2-7. So around holiday time again.\n\nHusbands sister is a teacher and gets 2 weeks off at Christmas, one week off late March, and 2 months off in summer. She pays $15,000/year to put her 3 kids in private school. All money is spent on the kids that they have so this is a great deal for her, plus childcare from g&g.\n\nI said flights at Christmas are crazy expensive and we will be building a house (super stressful) and it\u2019s our 10 year and I\u2019m saving up for a trip to Europe for fall 2025. So\u2026 we may not have the funds to go over Christmas next year.\n\nWhat about other times I said. Like summer? His sister said \u201cthen I never get to have a hot vacation.\u201d \n\nSo I said what about March\u2026 you get spring break right?\n\nShe said that\u2019s late March and it\u2019s just not good enough cuz it\u2019s too close to spring\u2026\n\nSo basically the only acceptable time to travel according to her is Christmas. Since she is calling the shots, apparently, it doesn\u2019t matter what I think or what I\u2019m comfortable with. \n\nSo I\u2019m thinking\u2026 well no. We can\u2019t travel Jan 2025. And they expect us to all travel together during the most expensive time of the year every other year??\n\nI\u2019m also uncomfortable spending lots of time with his family. We are both agnostic but they are SUPER RELIGIOUS! (Edit to add: homophobic and racist slurs are not uncommon)\n\nIt\u2019s taxing being around people you disagree with on so many fundamental levels. \n\nSo! Would you do this?

This also isn't about whether his parents are paying for hotels. Those factors are irrelevant: his parents money is their money to do with as they please, it doesn't obligate you to anything. His sister's vacation schedule is her vacation schedule. The $2500 you pay for the flights is what is relevant because that is YOUR money. Once you've spent it on trips with his parents, you don't have it available to spend on YOUR priorities. \n\nYou and your husband need to decide what YOU want to do and what YOU are comfortable with. Are you comfortable with spending $2500 on vacations with his family every other year? Are you comfortable thinking ahead to when you have kids and that $2500 turns into $5000?

If it\u2019s so important that we have family memory trips then my thought is they should do them every 3 or 4 years so it\u2019s actually a gift and the parents can pay for it all\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Yeah just trying to get my bearings if I\u2019m normal thinking this is all nuts. \n\nIf we pay for everything and they don\u2019t decide how we spend our money it just looks like us not joining them on their trips. In my mind the trips are really for his sister who gets an almost free trip (parents use their travel dollars on her kids) and free child care. It\u2019s all so \u201cSuzy gets her rest\u201d.", "Yes\u2026 abso-fucking-lutely. Just spent 2 days in a row with them for Christmas and I feel like I need  a week of detox. \u2026 imagine a whole week! See what I\u2019m saying? It\u2019s exhausting", "My choice. For instance, this year my grandma forgot to invite me to Christmas. I got a text the day of from my mom, who is narcissism incarnate, and she said that I WAS invited. But receipts prove otherwise. She told me I had to come drive 1 hour in bad weather last minute to join because grandma may not be alive much longer. This is also the gathering that included my aunt and uncle who hopped on the QAnon MAGA train who haven\u2019t spoken to anyone in my family for 2 years. So there\u2019s a nice emotional blackmail story for you. So being forgotten, and then gaslit by my mom that I wasn\u2019t forgotten and demanded I come to Christmas is not my choice. \n\nI did decline and now deal with the backlash of that from good old mom.", "Their family dynamic is different than yours. Except for the homophobia, they're not wrong for that. It's okay to be religious, it's okay to like Christmas break trips, and it's okay to want to travel every other year with your parents paying for everything but the flights. There is nothing wrong or illogical or weird about their arrangement (minus, of course, the homophobia.)\n\nIt's also okay if you don't want to do that. It's not wrong to dislike that arrangement for yourself. You can tell your husband he can join without you. Maybe some years you'll be interested in going; maybe you never will be. But it's still not wrong just because it's not the family dynamic you would have chosen or the one you grew to with. Just like it's not wrong of you not to like it. This will get a lot easier if you stop seeing this as a right vs wrong thing and start seeing it as a \"everyone has different preferences and that's okay\" thing.", "Maybe stay over the next trip with them (use the house and anniversary-excuse), and see where you are when planning start for the next trip? \nGood luck!", "So just don't go. In the post you're upset that your MILs plans interrupted Christmas with your family. But you family is miserable and stressful. So why aren't you taking the excuse to not be there?\n\n>So being forgotten, and then gaslit by my mom that I wasn\u2019t forgotten and demanded I come to Christmas is not my choice.\n\nTheir demands do not actually dictate your actions.", "This is a reasonable response!!", "If I don\u2019t go and he does won\u2019t they see that as not being a unified front? And I\u2019m being difficult and rejecting them and then it adds all this negative light to it? I don\u2019t see it as right or wrong so much as no right answer. Rock and a hard place.", "Thanks! That\u2019s the way it\u2019s gotta be.", "Why does that matter? \"Thanks, in-laws, but we're fine. Husband is going to enjoy his trip and I'm going to enjoy relaxing at home. I look forward to hearing about it when you get back!\" Rinse and repeat. \n\nYou're an adult. You don't need their approval. You don't need them to agree with your choices. You don't even have to stay in the same room as them if they start to criticize you. You can just thank them for their concern, say that you're fine, and then leave.", "Being a unified front is not synonymous with joined at the hip. It means that you both agree with how to approach a situation. If you and husband decide that you\u2019ll go on the family trip every four years and husband will go every other year and both of you enforce those boundaries, that\u2019s a unified front. \n\nTo be honest, I\u2019m wondering if you don\u2019t have a unified front right now because both of you are ignoring the other one\u2019s desires. In your explanation, neither of you sound like you know exactly what the other wants.", "Thanks for the insight \ud83d\udc4d", "NTA \n\nTalk to your husband about all of this. Building a house is an enormous expense so you have an excuse this year. But why are you, alone, saving for a European vacation while you\u2019re both paying for this house?", "NTA", "INFO. You should let/make your husband go without you. If you have kids, they can go with him half the time. You can celebrate Christmas with him before. That way he gets his inheritance of travel and you get your peace. It costs them the same whether or not you go and you can use the money saved on your flights for things for yourself.", "NTA\n\n  \nThis is easy: NOT doing ANY vacations with your in-laws is COMPLETELY FINE.", "NTA for not going, but YWBTA if you prevent him from going. \n\nYou have trickle-truthed this thing - you don't like his family and fundamentally do not *want* to go. You can handle the house building by yourself for a week - focus on projects you don't need his skills for. Only takes one to paint a wall.", "NTA. They\u2019re giving you a \u201cgift\u201d that forces you to spend your own money, and that\u2019s not a true gift. I\u2019d say \u201cwe can\u2019t afford to do this every other year\u201d and maybe go with them every other trip (so once every four years). That seems like a reasonable compromise.", "NTA.  A present that requires you to spend thousands you can\u2019t afford is not a present or a gift.", "NTA. You gave it a try, but it's not working out. Time to get off the carousel of madness. No one should have to put out that kind of money on FORCED 'obligation' trip, and certainly not more than once. When your 'holiday memories' are being turned into dread and misery, then that is reason enough to put the brakes on. \"Vacation\" time is precious and should not be spent on Obligation trips that are for someone else's pleasure; and to do so on a repeatedly? No. That's too big an Ask.", "NTA\n\nThey can offer, but you and hubby need to decide IF you are going.  \n\nJan 2 - 7 shouldn't be holiday pricing, though.  Usually, just after Jan 1 is cheap to travel.  Jan 2 might be pricy, depending on the day of the week, but Jan 7 shouldn't be.  \n\nWe love going on memory making trips with our adult children.  We pick a place and date, and OFFER to host them.  It is an OFFER not a mandate.", "Just the organization of funds. He pays all our bills and saves for retirement. I save money for travel and discretionary income. Yeah it\u2019s like\u2026 $450,000 in just build costs \ud83d\ude31", "Sounds like heaven to me", "We can\u2019t afford flights next year I is a perfectly reasonable answer that your husband should share.", "Impossible to know where the project will be at what point. If you don\u2019t get the house painted you can\u2019t get the floors in which holds up other trades so yeah\u2026 kinda need both people to be all hands on deck when you\u2019re paying interest on the build costs. Jan 2 the house might be done and we are selling our current house we live in. Might still be getting things done that don\u2019t need us\u2026 he might need to be installing flooring then. But not to worry. If he misses this one there\u2019s plenty more in the queue", "So STOP doing vacations with the inlaws.\n\n  \nIf your husband wants, let HIM and the kids go.", "You just said you'd miss the next one too - so how old are his parents? Clock is ticking on those memories, dude.", "That information changes everything. You were not fully informed before you married, and therefore can't be expected to stick to something you never agreed to. It's ridiculous to expect for nothing to change in your adult children's lives over a decade, much less the rest of their lives. More importantly, husband doesn't have a leg to stand on continuing to abide by that long ago conversation. YOU are his family now- two yesses, one no, on major outlays of money and vacation plans. Time to start creating your own family memories.", "So you should stay and your husband should Go. It's after the holydays, so you wouldn't be apart during this time. He shouldn't miss a important family trip every two years (wich sounds pretty reasonable) because of you. His family of origin is important too.", "What's wrong with him going by himself, though? He should just do that, it's his 'inheritance' (that he has to pay for, lol).", "I have to agree with you. You need to be around and supervise the building. Otherwise mistakes are made and not reversible. We were at our build everyday and caught so many things that were incorrect. Don\u2019t go and have husband home also because it does make a difference.", "Maybe his wife would like a vacation with her husband, and maybe she doesn't want to outlay a bunch of money for trips she's not going to go on. I'd say a family trip without her is fair every 3-4 years, because she wasn't warned about any of this.", "So the parents choose every time? You and DH never get to suggest a location? I\u2019d say no to this anyway, but that\u2019s another big reason to decline.", ">It makes me want to cry thinking of spending a week with them again.\n\nThen you should not be spending money you don't have on something you do not want to do. NTA but you and your husband need to have a discussion.", "When she specified that *she* saves for their vacations but they *both* save for the house, this led me to believe that their finances are separate enough for him to spend his money on something he wants.", "Yeah I hear that. But I feel like the optics of that scenario are that I\u2019m the bitch that\u2019s staying behind and what\u2019s so wrong with me that I can\u2019t go and we must be divided on it. Idk maybe that\u2019s just the way it will have to be. I guess it\u2019s ok if they don\u2019t like me very much. Right now they do because I pretty much hide who I am from them (like don\u2019t speak up with the homophobic remarks and all the Jesus talk). I\u2019m so concerned with them liking me. But maybe it\u2019s ok if they don\u2019t.", "Apparently sister chooses when and parents choose where\u2026 like wtf", "I think it is ok to stay home. Just tell them you are trying to save money for your big trip and your new home.", "LOL, sucks to be you. Why you care for their approval, no clue \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. Your husband is the problem not the in-laws \ud83e\udd23."]}
