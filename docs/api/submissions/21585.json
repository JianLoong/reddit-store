Then she complained that London was too crowded and expensive. \n\nWe took our kids to Disney World and we rented a condo with a kitchen and laundry room. She insisted on doing all the cooking and even went to the Publix to buy laundry stuff to do laundry. Then she complained about having to cook and do laundry on vacation.  \n\nSo this time around I asked her a place she might want to go. She chose a Canadian National Park. \n\nI made sure our hotel had a free breakfast and I budgeted for lunches, snacks and suppers. Our hotel had a laundry service but no facilities. \n\nI then told her that I wanted her to write down every day everything she did. I told her that the kids and I would be doing the same. \n\nSo we spent a week in Banff at a very nice hotel. We hiked and biked and are some great meals. Our kids made sure that they picked up after themselves and on our last night I sent all our dirty clothes out for cleaning. \n\nWe had her sister over to the house yesterday and she was telling her all about the trip and how hard she had to work to make sure we all had a good time.  \n\nI asked her what all she had done on the trip? She didn't cook, clean, do laundry, plan the days, or anything else. Literally all she did was wake up, eat, spend the day doing fun stuff, spend time in the pool or hot tub, and drink. \n\nShe said I didn't understand all the things she actually did so I asked her to say exactly what she did. She couldn't say exactly what she did.

How is childcare divided up in the home? On the vacations, how do you divide up the work the kids take (if they're young enough, who gets them dressed, who wakes them up, who pushes them to take showers, who picks out places to eat based on the children's food needs and preferences?) You mention making sure they cleaned up the last day, but there is so much more to watching kids than just making sure they clean up. I used to work in childcare. Kids are work even when you don't clean up after them and don't personally need to feed them. There's a whole industry around childcare for a reason and I'm getting the sense, from your post, that you may not be recognizing all of the effort it takes because you do come off a bit like \"fun dad\" who isn't seeing it. \n\nAre you guys ok financially? It reads to me like you're doing alright enough to vacation, but that it still requires pretty close budgeting and being cautious. I could easily see why financial concerns would push your wife to want to cook and do laundry to save money, but then coming away feeling like there hasn't been a vacation. Your telling her not to worry about it may not be enough to actual stop the stress about money. If this is the case, I would suggest that you pitch in to help. I notice you talked about your wife choosing to take on those jobs, but if she's doing it for the financial good of the family and she doesn't see you helping her out when she's elbow-deep in dishes and dirty clothes, I could see how resentment could grow.\n\nWhen you've planned the vacation stuff, has your wife recognized possible issues you didn't see and/or does she have higher standards for things like hotels? And what I mean by that is, does she more critically consider choices and how they work for your family? \n\nHonestly, I would judge this as YTA if I was a bit more confident in the things I'm picking up. But I recognize that that judgement would require several points of making assumptions. Here's what I'm picking up, rightly or wrongly, from your account:\n\nYour wife is primarily responsible for the home and your kids. She's either in a position where she's a SAHM, or doesn't feel financially secure enough to use money for non-needs that make life easier. She is generally the person who takes in the mental load of the family to the point where it's difficult for her to put more of that energy into vacation planning, but also possibly being concerned that not giving her own input means all the little things caregivers need to think about with children won't be considered by the parent who doesn't have to think about then every single day. It feels like you don't recognize the work she puts in and, in the one case where I do feel confident making an actual call on things, you reduce and dismiss her experience with the pretty gross suggestion that this is a sexual thing for her. That's the talk of someone wanting to be an asshole instead of actually reflecting on themselves. \n\nI really think you two should invest in therapy or counseling because what you have now isn't working and it seems like you're getting further from a resolution.", "NTA\n\nIf she wasn't a whiner, she wouldn't look like one in front of anyone.", "ESH\n\nHonestly, couples counseling.

Why do you think that is?\" or \"Sometimes it feels like you really focus on the negative when I see there is a lot of positive to focus on instead.\" \n\nMaybe your wife is just freaking insufferable.

Who managed the transportation to and from these activities?\n\nI could go on but I think that's more than a decent jumping off point. To clarify, I'm not insinuating your wife did ALL of this while you did none, just that the mental load is real and far more complex and in-depth than most people who aren't carrying it realize. The biggest takeaway here is that you two need counseling to start communicating more effectively or your marriage is honestly doomed.", "YTA just for those first three sentences. Your wife may also be an AH, but you asked. She is a human being, and no matter how much you loathe her complaining, she deserves equal respect.

Who handles the mental load of the day-to-day stuff in your house? \n\nI'm gonna hold back on judgement for now. Maybe your wife is a total jerk here, maybe you're oblivious to all the work she's doing. The invisible mental load of running a family is exhausting, and many (not all) men are oblivious to how much their female partners are doing to keep things running.

Loves it. I think it might be a sexual thing with her. \n\nI took her to Jamaica and she complained about the sun and sand. \n\nI let her completely plan our next vacation and she complained about having to do all the planning. Then she complained that London was too crowded and expensive. \n\nWe took our kids to Disney World and we rented a condo with a kitchen and laundry room. She insisted on doing all the cooking and even went to the Publix to buy laundry stuff to do laundry. Then she complained about having to cook and do laundry on vacation.  \n\nSo this time around I asked her a place she might want to go. She chose a Canadian National Park. \n\nI made sure our hotel had a free breakfast and I budgeted for lunches, snacks and suppers. Our hotel had a laundry service but no facilities. \n\nI then told her that I wanted her to write down every day everything she did. I told her that the kids and I would be doing the same. \n\nSo we spent a week in Banff at a very nice hotel. We hiked and biked and are some great meals. Our kids made sure that they picked up after themselves and on our last night I sent all our dirty clothes out for cleaning. \n\nWe had her sister over to the house yesterday and she was telling her all about the trip and how hard she had to work to make sure we all had a good time.  \n\nI asked her what all she had done on the trip? She didn't cook, clean, do laundry, plan the days, or anything else. Literally all she did was wake up, eat, spend the day doing fun stuff, spend time in the pool or hot tub, and drink. \n\nShe said I didn't understand all the things she actually did so I asked her to say exactly what she did. She couldn't say exactly what she did. Then she called me an asshole for trying to make her look like a whiner in front of her sister. \n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

However... That doesn't necessarily mean that she did absolutely nothing nothing.

It may not seem like a big deal, but maybe those are the things she is doing and it still may be overwhelming to her.

That\u2019s the only reason to complain like that.", "Nope. SHE NEEDS THERAPY. This is not a couples issue. Thus is an individual woman's issue.", "This sounds like she\u2019s exhausted carrying the mental load in the relationship. I don\u2019t know that for sure, but I\u2019d suggest couple\u2019s therapy and bringing that up to see if that\u2019s what she was grasping to explain. This is a very common and under recognized issue in relationships.\n\nEdit: mental load examples for vacations: who packed the kids\u2019 bags? Who did all the laundry prior to ensure you had everything you need available to pack? Who cleaned so you could come back to a clean home? Who made sure the passports were available and accessible? Who got the plane tickets ready and checked you in prior? Who coordinated the ride to and from the airport? When you got to the hotel who unpacked? Who checked to make sure things were clean and in working order before settling in? Who made sure everyone was up in time for the activities you planned? Who got the kids bathed, dressed, etc? \n\nI could go on and on about mental load. It\u2019s exhausting and, in most relationships, falls almost entirely on the woman. Because of that they never really feel able to relax because they are always having to make sure everyone else is okay because no one else will.

We're divorced now.", "Have you told her how it makes you feel when she complains about a trip you have specifically planned so she wouldn't have to do a bunch of work, rather than shame her in front of another person?\n\nThis could help her understand why you don't like her complaining.", "How is this sexual though?", "ESH because it sounds like you both need to work on communicating your needs more effectively. And also, saying it \u201chas to be sexual\u201d because YOU can\u2019t think of a reason is completely dehumanizing and honestly pretty offensive.\n\nHi, I admit that I am a complainer \ud83d\ude4b\u200d\u2640\ufe0f this may not be specifically how your wife is feeling, but i want to offer an alternative reason/example:\nIt\u2019s complicated and I\u2019m still actively working through it but I\u2019ll try my best\u2014My complaining is rooted in me from my family. They are also complainers. But to us, it\u2019s not really \u201ccomplaining\u201d, it\u2019s sharing an experience. When i complain, i am trying to simultaneously offer up vulnerability/share my feelings and ask if this particular person is also having difficult feelings about anything/allow them to do the same. I think it\u2019s a consequence of not having any healthy outlets for \u201cnegative\u201d emotion (we\u2019re a classic Midwestern family that isn\u2019t allowed to say how we feel without judgement). We complain to each other constantly. It could be the smallest little thing and not actually that big of a deal, but i find myself complaining about these things as both an outlet for my \u201cnegative\u201d emotions. Sometimes I\u2019ll just go and find something to complain about, especially when my anxiety is high. It helps me also compartmentalize and put something to blame for how I\u2019m feeling so i don\u2019t have to take any responsibility for it myself.\nHappy to try to explain further, but I\u2019ve been working through this extensively in therapy (particularly, my anxiety and my hate of \u201cnegative\u201d emotion) and it\u2019s been helping immensely. I recognized i was doing it when i got married and my husband brought it up, ironically, after our honeymoon vacation. \nDoes your wife\u2019s family complain? Do you see this behavior elsewhere outside of vacation? Does vacation stir up anxiety for her? Have you tried asking her what her intentions or wishes are in regards to her complaints?", "Do you like her? Why do you bother to go on a vacation with her at all with this much resentment", "What I've learned about complainers, is that the complaint is the priority. It's what they truly enjoy doing. Therefore, you can never do anything right, because then they would have nothing to complain about. And complaining means more to them than anything. So even if you do exactly what they tell you to do, they will still find fault. Because they have to complain.", "I have observed that in life that there are a solid percentage of humans who have a victim complex and thrive on drama, and complaint. They need to appear to be a victim in their own lives, otherwise who is to blame for them not being everything they \u201cshould\u201d and having everything they want. Perhaps it is because life has become too mundane, that the day to day life is too ordinary, too numbing, that they complain and seek out conflict as a way to feel *something*. I would be willing to bet that if you didn\u2019t go on vacation, she would find lots of other things to complain about that seem equally undeserving of her ire.", "Where does it say the kids cleaned up only on the last day?\n\nAlso, you seem to be selectively reading the text. The OP said she insisted on doing the cooking and cleaning. She could have chose not to do it. \n\nEither way, it wouldn't matter. She would complain about it no matter what happens", "Yeah, the whole post reads a lot like a \"parent\" who wants accolades and a gold medal for *actually parenting.* And maybe the wife was still exhausted during the vacation, becuase the kids are used to her being the one they go to for stuff. I'd bet her vacation was full of \"Mom, look at me on this rock! Mom, look how fast I can go on my bike!\" and her making sure to get pictures, her making sure the kids had a good time. \n\nAnd then OP jumped in saying he sent off the dirty clothes to laundry service like he's a hero.", "Guys really do get the short end of the stick a lot, don't they?", "You mean read the WHOLE post before giving a verdict?

You've bent over backwards to try and craft a vacation that satisfies her without a litany of complaints, including having her tailor the vacation to her own desires. You've spoken to her personally about this. She continued the behavior in front of her sister and you showed her the receipts. When confronted with the facts, she had to admit she really had nothing to complain about. Sounds more like an intervention. Your wife's default setting is \"FIND FAULT\". That's gotta be exhausting and it sounds like therapy is needed.", "If your children had been younger, I would've thought she could be stressed from childcare but with this information that seems unlikely. Does she have hobbies, friends, a job?\n\nFrom what I've read, I get the feeling that you're frustrated because you feel that you're providing for all her wants/needs and she is ungrateful. I think she may feel like she's been putting aside her wishes for the sake of the family -- for example, maybe she didn't really wan't to go to Banff for her own benefit, but thought it would be a good family vacation. Of course, this is just conjecture.\n\nI don't feel comfortable passing a judgement. I agree with many other commenters that you both would benefit from marriage counseling, or at least an honest discussion about your needs and expectations.", "OP is, intentionally or not, being manipulative instead of direct. For instance in response to her dislike for the Jamaica trip, he put all planning on her - ie to make it so that she is responsible for any decision she may later be unhappy with. Same with demanding that she document all her tasks. And, frankly he doesn't really know precisely what she was referring to when complaining to her friend. Maybe she's thinking about certain things that aren't on his radar, relating to packing, preparing things at home before/during the trip, sleep and other habit adjustments for the kids while traveling, etc. \n\nHer complaints do seem excessive and unreasonable BUT my point was that OP is not addressing this in a constructive way.
