He's our first child.\n\nI have a good relationship with my parents, however, they (especially my mom) have a difficult time respecting my boundaries, and they were a bit overprotective of me growing up. I am their only child, so naturally they are going to feel protective of me. While I wouldn't go as far as to describe my mom as a helicopter parent, she seemed to have a hard time allowing me to make mistakes. She would want to have a say in anything I was doing, and offer advice whether I wanted it or not. When I was little, this was totally understandable, but as I grew up it became very annoying. When I moved out, I told her that now that I'm grown up, she needs to respect my boundaries, as well as accept that I might do certain things differently from how she does. I've requested that she please ask me if want help/advice with something, and to please respect my wishes if I say no. She seems to have a very hard time with this; she'll reluctantly say she'll try to do that, but honestly I don't think she's making enough effort. We've argued about this many times. It really feels like she doesn't trust me. When my son was born, I asked both of my parents to please leave the parenting up to me and my wife, and if we need help we'll ask. They agreed, though my mom seemed reluctant (not surprised).\n\nNow, I didn't think it was my place to ask my in-laws to do this, because they're her parents, not mine. I told her that if she would like her parents' help/advice with raising our son, it was fine with me, and the decision of how much or how little involvement her parents had was up to her. I am also more comfortable with my wife's parents because she's the youngest of four children, and therefore they have more experience as parents. They know when it's appropriate to offer help, and when they should take a step back.\n\nAnyways, today we're having a barbecue for the 4th of July. We invited both of our families. It was the first time we've all been in the same room since our wedding. My mom saw how much my in-laws were helping with our son; feeding him, changing him, putting him down for a nap, etc. (they're mainly doing this because my wife is busy in the kitchen). My parents took me aside and asked why I want my in-laws' help but not theirs. I told her the reasons. Dad took it pretty well (he enjoys being a \"fun Grandpa\") but my mom is very hurt. \n\nNow I feel bad. I was looking forward to a fun day with our families, but now I'm feeling guilty. My mom basically is just standing around doing nothing and looks hurt. My feelings of wanting her to leave the parenting up to me and my wife hasn't changed, but I don't know how to express this without upsetting her.

I can understand why she's upset.\n\nYour children are your parents only chance to be grandparents, and you've decided they're not going to get much of a chance to do anything.

Is she comfortable with the boundaries you have drawn? Does she, in fact, prefer those boundaries be in place and that you are managing the situation as you are?\n\nIf you are taking the role of protecting the both of you from your mom's undue interference, then NTA - BUT you also have to accept that the consequence of that boundary-holding is exactly what happened at your family gathering, and your mom's feelings getting a bit hurt. \n\nIt will take her a while to re-learn new behaviours, so I would advocate patience patience patience with lots of talking and more patience with each other.

Why can't your mom feed the baby  or change him\n\nIt's not like she changes him because she doesnt like his outfit, or moves his bassinet  to another room, or rocks him to sleep when that isn't your routine.\n\nGive your mom a chance to learn the boundaries.", "YTA towards your parents.

To be honest, this would cut me to my core if my sister (2 kids) wouldn\u2019t allow me to do anything for my niblings but her in laws had 100% access. If they had actually violated a boundary and you then imposed it, it would make sense. But you aren\u2019t even giving them a chance to do the right thing.

She\u2019s allowed to see everyone else be part of the family but she is only allowed to be a witness to it. Honestly if OP feels that strongly they should go NC. I can imagine it\u2019s hurtful for his mom (who never meant to harm her child and truly thought she was protecting him) to see that her child trusts others with their kid but not mom at all! She might not be mother of the year but she has a right to be hurt. And OP IMO is being a little harsh.

I understand the boundaries talk but it\u2019s pretty cruel to tell her she can\u2019t do anything at all with the baby but invite her over so she can watch the other grandparents be allowed to care for them.", "No but considering the mom seemed willing to be hands off till she saw the in laws were allowed access, I\u2019m not sure mom is as unreasonable as OP thinks. It\u2019s pretty common for grandparents to be way more permissive with grandkids than they were with their kids. I think she would be able to change a diaper without comment. She might struggle with keeping her opinions about screens or something to herself but is she really gonna make a scene over a diaper brand in front of the whole family?", "As someone who has a boyfriend who is an only child with a mother like this, we\u2019re most likely going to adopt the same lifestyle once we have kids.

Just look at the damage OP is already trying to manage from his own upbringing. \n\nProtect your baby, OP, and don't let a bunch of selfish or ignorant folks on Reddit make you feel bad about doing it.

My oldest brother let my Mom be heavily involved with his kids and she stomps all over there parenting. My second oldest brother doesn't live here but has expressed annoyance when she goes to visit and she tries that. My wife and i put a hard no to that with our oldest and it's been a conflict ever since which all our kid's. We even went LC/NC for almost a year. \n\nWhen we have her an inch she took a mile and it makes it difficult to bond because we have to keep going back and forth with her (which is her own doing). So for that I can agree with OP.\n\nI kinda disagree with only leaving parenting involvement to each spouse. Sure you have your spouse handle certain issues between families but both should be in agreement. So OP leaving now much involvement his wifes family has up to her i don't agree with and it should be a joint decision. \n\nBut overall I understand why he took that stance because I have been there for all 3 of my kids and still deal with it with my baby girl now.

She was only asked to do basic tasks while babysitting and she fricking killed the baby", "But OP asked his parents to stay away and they did. They didn't try to be sneaky or anything they respected the boundaries and now learn that the boundaries were only set for them.", "Seems like she's been respectful of them if shes never changed the kid", "Cuz shes the grandma?

It doesn't really make it fair other wise as OP's parents might find it unfair that OP's in-laws are getting \"preferable/special treatment\".

Where does it say she can't hug the baby? It sounds to me like she's just not allowed to do anything parenting wise with the baby not that she's not allowed to interact with the baby at all. Also if she's the only one with a history of way overstepping boundaries then it makes total sense for there to be a rule that applies only to her. Like if every time my friends and I got together to drink and I always way over did it and it negatively affected my friends it'd be completely understandable if they asked me to set a limit on how many drinks I consume or even said you can't get drinks with us anymore but we can still hangout in environments without alcohol. She can be upset but at the end of the day that's not ops fault and op isn't an asshole for holding the boundary. Sure maybe she respects boundaries now but she makes it clear through body language that she doesn't want to and if that's the case she hasn't worked on herself enough to make those boundaries unreasonable. If she didn't respect boundaries for decades then it's hard to believe she could handle respecting those boundaries when ops not next to her making sure they're being respected. There are plenty of cases where grandparents pretend to be respectful of the parents boundaries then the second they're trusted to be left alone with the child they go right back to their old behavior. If the parents have to be next to you while you change a diaper because you have a past of just doing what you want then there's really no reason for you to do it at all.", "Thank you! Not to mention, who\u2019s being an over protective helicopter parent now?! She\u2019s not going to harm the kid if she\u2019s allowed the change a damn diaper. Sheesh.", "There is alot of grey area between \"leave the actual parent stuff to us\" and going no contact. It's not like she can't touch the baby at all and by the sound of it I'm sure she'd hate the no contact more than the boundary. If you claim to respect a boundary but in your head tell yourself that you should be entitled to do what the boundary stops you from doing then you are not respecting the boundary. That's what the mother is doing. She has not exhibited behavior that shows op can trust her not to do what she's done her whole life so I don't blame op for not trusting her. Also she chose to go to the party, she just as easily could've chosen not to since she knew she wouldn't be allowed to care for the baby. If she really wants this to change the way to go about it is to actually be willing to change her behavior. She's not willing to do that(it's obvious by the fit she threw) despite op giving her the chance to show she can change. This route of demanding to be trusted without actually earning the trust is a one way street to never being trusted again.", "Yea, I think it sounds like the in-laws know how to respect boundaries, thus they can have more flexibility and lend a hand here and there whereas OPs mom has shown time and time again that she has trouble respecting boundaries and decisions, so she gets a much firmer boundary. If she were given three same flexibility, it sounds like she'd stomp all over or guilt trip him... NTA", "Many boundary stomping people are \"give an inch, take a mile\". OP knows if his mother is like this, and therefore he cannot give an inch (feeding or changing the baby) without the expectation that she is allowed to do this all the time or that him asking her to do these tasks is opening the door to her criticism.\n\nHer reaction (pouting) is exactly what I would expect from someone like her. Instead of voicing her feelings she is waiting for OP to crumble and give in. She is being very manipulative. Don't crumble  OP.", "Yea but the problem is you can't even give people like that an inch. Day they say ye to letting them give a bottle. Wouldn't be surprised if his mom came back and said \" oh I dumped out the breadt milk you had and put some formula in the bottle so they can get used to formula, that way they can spend the night with us.\" Or something like that. Parents like his that think they know better about everything can take a task as simple as giving the kid a bottle and still find a way to fuck it up. I'm sure op knows his parents well enough that if they aren't even allowed to do the basic things, there's a pretty good reason behind it.", "People are allowed to have different boundaries for different parties. My mother isn't permitted anywhere near my wife and I. Her parents are encouraged to come visit when they have the time.

I can see OP not wanting to give mum any room to go back to her old ways because she's shown time and again she will. \n\nThe in laws have not stomped boundaries and therefore don't have the same hard boundaries because it's not needed.\n\nIt's the equivalent of having two dogs. One roams, refuses to come when called or follow their training.

It's not overreacting or over protective to say \"until it's clear that you have actually worked on yourself and changed your behavior long-term\". The baby is still in diapers and most adults take multiple years of personal work to change behaviors like this.

With the information we have here I'm willing to bet that's what the mother would do so it's not unreasonable to make a rule to stop behavior that only she does. Since the mother is the one with the behavior that killed the trust op had in her then it's on the mother to behave in a way that would rebuild that trust. Op isn't obligated to trust someone that has already exhibited behavior that makes them untrustworthy no matter what blood they may share and trust doesn't rebuild quickly.

Everything should be decided and done as a couple and as a united front. If your in laws are bothering you, absolutely talk to your wife about it and decide together what to do. You can decide from there that it's better if just one of you talks to your respective parents if you think that's better than the 4 of you.

I don't understand why there is one big YTA comment that has gotten a thousand likes. Meanwhile, there are sooo many more comments on here that are NTA and they all pretty much say the same thing. Most of us can recognize that the mom of OP can't respect boundaries. Period. Classic \"give an inch and they'll take a mile\" scenario.\n\nFor those of you who don't see how bad OP's mom is, let's break it down. \n\n**First, OP's parents both have a track record of stepping over boundaries.**\n\n>I have a good relationship with my parents, however, they (especially my mom) have a difficult time respecting my boundaries, and they were a bit overprotective of me growing up.\n\nNote the *present* tense. They *still* overstep even in OP's adult life. OP's mom especially, given the paragraphs that follow. This is a lifetime of being invalidated and being not listened to that OP has to endure. That's pretty horrible if you ask me. \n\n>When I moved out, I told her that now that I'm grown up, she needs to respect my boundaries, as well as accept that I might do certain things differently from how she does. I've requested that she please ask me if want help/advice with something, and to please respect my wishes if I say no. She seems to have a very hard time with this; she'll reluctantly say she'll try to do that, but honestly I don't think she's making enough effort. We've argued about this many times. It really feels like she doesn't trust me.\n\nOP's mom continues her proven track record of stepping over boundaries of her own fully grow adult son who is more than capable of advocating for himself. You really think she won't step over boundaries her son gives about his 3 month-old baby the moment OP turns his back? A child who can't say anything?\n\nThe problem with people like OP's mom is that they think there is no harm in getting their way, that boundaries are just \"small things\". They are not \"small things\". Babies are fragile and one thing can easily lead to another. Accidents happen. For those of you saying changing diapers is different, you can't fathom how even an iota of trust with these kinds of people can mean serious harm to the child down the road. What if the child develops allergies? What if they have special health concerns or dietary restrictions? It is very easy for people who minimize concerns and rules to break them and then endanger the child. \n\nAnd lest we forget, OP's mom has a literal exact history of not respecting a child's needs and boundaries.\n\n>She would want to have a say in anything I was doing, and offer advice whether I wanted it or not. When I was little, this was totally understandable, but as I grew up it became very annoying.\n\nIf OP gave his mom a say in anything now about care for his child, she would more than likely unleash that same kind of hell on OP's child during the formative years. As the son of narcissists, I can say that that stuff is freaking traumatizing and hurtful as hell to a child's sense of trust and their sense of self and self-esteem. OP is more than justified in establishing that his mom gets no say and no involvement in anything care-based. Not even basic care. \n\nStopping this minimizing and invalidating behaviour before it even starts was the right call.\n\n**Second. Some of you who say YTA are claiming OP is being hypocritical though because of how he and his wife handled his in-laws' involvement. Is he truly an AH though?**\n\n>I told her that if she would like her parents' help/advice with raising our son, it was fine with me, and the decision of how much or how little involvement her parents had was up to her.\n\nHe trusts his wife to make that call. That's good co-parenting right there. He follows up with the reasons why he and his wife allow his in-laws to care for the baby:\n\n>I am also more comfortable with my wife's parents because she's the youngest of four children, and therefore they have more experience as parents. \n\nThe \"more experience as parents\" argument is admittedly dubious reasoning here. People can be good parents even if they only have a single child. More children does not necessarily mean better parenting expertise. However, let's keep in mind that OP *was* that single child and he did NOT have a great time. Understandable why he might think that.\n\nBut I digress. The *real* reason the IL's can handle the baby is this:\n\n>They know when it's appropriate to offer help, and when they should take a step back.\n\nIt boils down to a single sentence to describe why OP trusts them for OP. Contrast that to OP's rant on mom. It speaks volumes on how much he trusts the IL's. No shit, of course OP's mom is treated differently. *She is reaping what she sowed. Her own son doesn't trust her.*\n\nWhat gets me is the gall of this woman. Some of you are saying OP is an AH and accusing him of trying to cut her off from her own grandkid. \n\nWith all due respect, that is *NOT* what OP said. OP said she didn't get to change the baby's diapers or feed the baby or put the kid down for a nap. \n\nDoes it hurt to be actively excluded from caring for your grandkid? Yeah, probably. It's true that her involvement is forcibly limited. That probably does hurt. **But she so freaking deserves this treatment.** \n\nThe reality is that OP does not trust his mom to care for the baby properly in very significant but very basic ways. But OP has every right to do so as a parent to dictate how people interact with their child. OP mistrusts her. Ergo, she isn't allowed to be overly involved. Damn good call if you ask me. \n\nHowever, we should also note that OP's mom still gets to interact with the baby. She still gets to play with it, hold it. She gets to talk to it. She's not barred from interacting like some of you are saying or barred from saying I love you to the kid. She wants to be able to take care of the kid in a significant and meaningful way? She needs to earn OP's trust back. \n\nInstead, her reaction at the party was to *choose* to play the victim card and to choose to do absolute nothing but mope about and guilt trip when she didn't get her way. What a childish fit of petulance. Absolutely ridiculous. That is narcissist 101 there. That only further erodes the trust in her. \n\nContrast that to the dad who took it in stride. That is what repairing trust and regaining trust looks like. Starts small. Respecting wishes. Accepting consequence. Going with the flow. \n\nOP I'm glad you stood firm. Good job. I'm sorry your mom is a narcissist and she made you feel shitty and ruined the party. She's the shitty one.

If this were really a type of parent (that I've obviously never dealt with), who really was a problem OP would tell us more about how awful she was and he didn't.

In any other society, that's what we'd call a first-world problem. So yeah, I've no shame in calling OP spolied and I don't mind blaming his mother for it.
