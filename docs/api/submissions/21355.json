He's our first child.\n\nI have a good relationship with my parents, however, they (especially my mom) have a difficult time respecting my boundaries, and they were a bit overprotective of me growing up. I am their only child, so naturally they are going to feel protective of me. While I wouldn't go as far as to describe my mom as a helicopter parent, she seemed to have a hard time allowing me to make mistakes. She would want to have a say in anything I was doing, and offer advice whether I wanted it or not. When I was little, this was totally understandable, but as I grew up it became very annoying. When I moved out, I told her that now that I'm grown up, she needs to respect my boundaries, as well as accept that I might do certain things differently from how she does. I've requested that she please ask me if want help/advice with something, and to please respect my wishes if I say no. She seems to have a very hard time with this; she'll reluctantly say she'll try to do that, but honestly I don't think she's making enough effort. We've argued about this many times. It really feels like she doesn't trust me. When my son was born, I asked both of my parents to please leave the parenting up to me and my wife, and if we need help we'll ask. They agreed, though my mom seemed reluctant (not surprised).\n\nNow, I didn't think it was my place to ask my in-laws to do this, because they're her parents, not mine. I told her that if she would like her parents' help/advice with raising our son, it was fine with me, and the decision of how much or how little involvement her parents had was up to her. I am also more comfortable with my wife's parents because she's the youngest of four children, and therefore they have more experience as parents. They know when it's appropriate to offer help, and when they should take a step back.\n\nAnyways, today we're having a barbecue for the 4th of July. We invited both of our families. It was the first time we've all been in the same room since our wedding. My mom saw how much my in-laws were helping with our son; feeding him, changing him, putting him down for a nap, etc. (they're mainly doing this because my wife is busy in the kitchen). My parents took me aside and asked why I want my in-laws' help but not theirs. I told her the reasons. Dad took it pretty well (he enjoys being a \"fun Grandpa\") but my mom is very hurt. \n\nNow I feel bad. I was looking forward to a fun day with our families, but now I'm feeling guilty. My mom basically is just standing around doing nothing and looks hurt. My feelings of wanting her to leave the parenting up to me and my wife hasn't changed, but I don't know how to express this without upsetting her.

I can understand why she's upset.\n\nYour children are your parents only chance to be grandparents, and you've decided they're not going to get much of a chance to do anything.

Is she comfortable with the boundaries you have drawn? Does she, in fact, prefer those boundaries be in place and that you are managing the situation as you are?\n\nIf you are taking the role of protecting the both of you from your mom's undue interference, then NTA - BUT you also have to accept that the consequence of that boundary-holding is exactly what happened at your family gathering, and your mom's feelings getting a bit hurt. \n\nIt will take her a while to re-learn new behaviours, so I would advocate patience patience patience with lots of talking and more patience with each other.

Why can't your mom feed the baby  or change him\n\nIt's not like she changes him because she doesnt like his outfit, or moves his bassinet  to another room, or rocks him to sleep when that isn't your routine.\n\nGive your mom a chance to learn the boundaries.", "YTA towards your parents.

To be honest, this would cut me to my core if my sister (2 kids) wouldn\u2019t allow me to do anything for my niblings but her in laws had 100% access. If they had actually violated a boundary and you then imposed it, it would make sense. But you aren\u2019t even giving them a chance to do the right thing.

Shes never respected the boundaries op has set it sounds like you are heavily ignoring her past behavior", "I\u2019m not saying OP isn\u2019t TA here, but that saying makes no sense whatsoever.  People should be treated based on their actions, not based on their titles.", "With boundary stompers I love to say \"give them an inch, they'll run a damn marathon\" lol. People who don't have these types in their lives will never really get it. I had to yell over my mom to tell her I wasn't going to make my closet an office when I lived in a *studio* apartment so small I didn't have counter space for a microwave. I ended up hanging up on her every time she mentioned it until she got the point. People often think I'm mean to her but once they get more of the story it usually flips to \"oh my God why do you even talk to her?\".", "Oh my god. This must have been terrifying. I\u2019m so sorry. \u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83e\ude79", "I hear that but she sounds pushy not abusive. She literally loses all unsupervised contact and even then she needs to stand a safe distance from the baby. No touching, no hugs, no talking (bc she might be overbearing), and absolutely no changing diapers! I get OP\u2019s concerns and applaud them for making sure their child isn\u2019t burdened by grandmas fears and opinions but does she really deserve to basically be cut off. But only partially. She\u2019s allowed to see everyone else be part of the family but she is only allowed to be a witness to it. Honestly if OP feels that strongly they should go NC. I can imagine it\u2019s hurtful for his mom (who never meant to harm her child and truly thought she was protecting him) to see that her child trusts others with their kid but not mom at all! She might not be mother of the year but she has a right to be hurt. And OP IMO is being a little harsh. If she accepts butting out (which at this point it seems she has, she only got upset when she saw this was a rule only for her), why are we assuming she can\u2019t change a diaper without a negative comment about the brand or whatever.", "They would be there the entire time, so how much could she do? What everyone seems to be missing is that his wife was getting buried in the kitchen while he was playing Grandparent monitor? It sounds like his mother got to stand around with her hands folded. She could have been involved in some way.\n\n.", "Honestly op should go nc if he feels he can\u2019t even let her feed or change the baby. I understand the boundaries talk but it\u2019s pretty cruel to tell her she can\u2019t do anything at all with the baby but invite her over so she can watch the other grandparents be allowed to care for them.", "No but considering the mom seemed willing to be hands off till she saw the in laws were allowed access, I\u2019m not sure mom is as unreasonable as OP thinks. It\u2019s pretty common for grandparents to be way more permissive with grandkids than they were with their kids. I think she would be able to change a diaper without comment. She might struggle with keeping her opinions about screens or something to herself but is she really gonna make a scene over a diaper brand in front of the whole family?", "As someone who has a boyfriend who is an only child with a mother like this, we\u2019re most likely going to adopt the same lifestyle once we have kids. We\u2019ll look up and his mom would have had our kids baptized in a church before we even get to say no!", "Mm hmm! My mother had 15 years of my adulthood being told to please back off and stop being manipulative and controlling. She is now not in my life at all. You have to have this type of parent to even begin to understand what OP is going through. \n\nTh amount of times people with good parents have told me that I owe my mother access to me and my life is staggering. \n\nNTA", "You're 100% right, but sadly there are far too many people like this reply's OP who view the baby, not just as property, but as community property, as if OP's parents have a right to the baby and he is interfering with those rights. But that baby is a human being, not a bicycle. Taking turns and being fair don't enter into it. The controlling helicopter grandma is a danger to the baby's mental health. Just look at the damage OP is already trying to manage from his own upbringing. \n\nProtect your baby, OP, and don't let a bunch of selfish or ignorant folks on Reddit make you feel bad about doing it. The only thing that matters is keeping the baby safe, even if it's from \"well-meaning\" abusers.", "I completely sympathize with OP because my mom is that way, however, she had 6 of us boys and her boundary stomping is still present to this day. My oldest brother let my Mom be heavily involved with his kids and she stomps all over there parenting. My second oldest brother doesn't live here but has expressed annoyance when she goes to visit and she tries that. My wife and i put a hard no to that with our oldest and it's been a conflict ever since which all our kid's. We even went LC/NC for almost a year. \n\nWhen we have her an inch she took a mile and it makes it difficult to bond because we have to keep going back and forth with her (which is her own doing). So for that I can agree with OP.\n\nI kinda disagree with only leaving parenting involvement to each spouse. Sure you have your spouse handle certain issues between families but both should be in agreement. So OP leaving now much involvement his wifes family has up to her i don't agree with and it should be a joint decision. \n\nBut overall I understand why he took that stance because I have been there for all 3 of my kids and still deal with it with my baby girl now. NTA", "But mom has respected the boundaries. She only got upset when she realized no one else had the same boundaries. If she could accept that she has no say then why are we assuming she would have a strong negative opinion if OP let her change the kid or feed the kid? OP is projecting and punishing his mom bc of how angry he is for her overbearing parenting. While I understand OP not wanting it to repeat with their child, I\u2019m not convinced they aren\u2019t overreacting re: nap, feeding, diapers. And it\u2019s ironic bc they are being very controlling just like their mom.", "agreed. my mom is not like this but my friend's mom is so I get it and it's crazy to me that this is the top response", "How is her feeding the child or a changing a diaper going to affect him? Like, I understand no punishment or life lessons, but helping the kid eat is too much? He\u2019s saying they can\u2019t be grandparents at all, so why even keep them in his life?", "Aw no, she had to face the consequences of your own actions? How sad for her, maybe she\u2019ll actually change now that she sees how real people interact with their grandchildren and children and what exposure that gets them with the kids and what her behaviour gets her", "Remember that story about a grandma who killed the babygirl because she didn\u2019t believe in allergies and rubbed coconut oil all over her scalp? She was only asked to do basic tasks while babysitting and she fricking killed the baby", "But OP asked his parents to stay away and they did. They didn't try to be sneaky or anything they respected the boundaries and now learn that the boundaries were only set for them.", "Seems like she's been respectful of them if shes never changed the kid", "Cuz shes the grandma? Tf", "Changing a diaper is basic childcare, which is lot the same as parenting.\n\nParenting is the decisions about actually raising the child.\n\nOPs mom historically always gives her opinion and insists on involvement. I applaud him for enforcing the boundary that he and his wife get to make the decisions about how their kid is raised. I understand why he has asked her not share her opinion unless explicitly asked for it.\n\nBut letting her help with CARE tasks and bonding with the baby isn\u2019t parenting. Excluding her from these tasks seems a bit mean. Obviously she\u2019s not entitled to care for her grandson, but I feel like OP is overshooting his concern", "I'm not saying that they should be based on their titles I'm just saying that the boundary should be the same across the board. It doesn't really make it fair other wise as OP's parents might find it unfair that OP's in-laws are getting \"preferable/special treatment\". It's a saying I was bought up with and I'm from the UK so it might not make sense to someone from the US but it makes perfect sense to me.", "Luckily for them my fianc\u00e9 was the one getting him so he just went in and grabbed him after giving them 10 minutes to bring him out of it was me I would\u2019ve called the cops", "Yeah I wasn't saying she was abusive. Where does it say she can't hug the baby? It sounds to me like she's just not allowed to do anything parenting wise with the baby not that she's not allowed to interact with the baby at all. Also if she's the only one with a history of way overstepping boundaries then it makes total sense for there to be a rule that applies only to her. Like if every time my friends and I got together to drink and I always way over did it and it negatively affected my friends it'd be completely understandable if they asked me to set a limit on how many drinks I consume or even said you can't get drinks with us anymore but we can still hangout in environments without alcohol. She can be upset but at the end of the day that's not ops fault and op isn't an asshole for holding the boundary. Sure maybe she respects boundaries now but she makes it clear through body language that she doesn't want to and if that's the case she hasn't worked on herself enough to make those boundaries unreasonable. If she didn't respect boundaries for decades then it's hard to believe she could handle respecting those boundaries when ops not next to her making sure they're being respected. There are plenty of cases where grandparents pretend to be respectful of the parents boundaries then the second they're trusted to be left alone with the child they go right back to their old behavior. If the parents have to be next to you while you change a diaper because you have a past of just doing what you want then there's really no reason for you to do it at all.", "Thank you! Not to mention, who\u2019s being an over protective helicopter parent now?! She\u2019s not going to harm the kid if she\u2019s allowed the change a damn diaper. Sheesh.", "There is alot of grey area between \"leave the actual parent stuff to us\" and going no contact. It's not like she can't touch the baby at all and by the sound of it I'm sure she'd hate the no contact more than the boundary. If you claim to respect a boundary but in your head tell yourself that you should be entitled to do what the boundary stops you from doing then you are not respecting the boundary. That's what the mother is doing. She has not exhibited behavior that shows op can trust her not to do what she's done her whole life so I don't blame op for not trusting her. Also she chose to go to the party, she just as easily could've chosen not to since she knew she wouldn't be allowed to care for the baby. If she really wants this to change the way to go about it is to actually be willing to change her behavior. She's not willing to do that(it's obvious by the fit she threw) despite op giving her the chance to show she can change. This route of demanding to be trusted without actually earning the trust is a one way street to never being trusted again.", "Yea, I think it sounds like the in-laws know how to respect boundaries, thus they can have more flexibility and lend a hand here and there whereas OPs mom has shown time and time again that she has trouble respecting boundaries and decisions, so she gets a much firmer boundary. If she were given three same flexibility, it sounds like she'd stomp all over or guilt trip him... NTA", "Many boundary stomping people are \"give an inch, take a mile\". OP knows if his mother is like this, and therefore he cannot give an inch (feeding or changing the baby) without the expectation that she is allowed to do this all the time or that him asking her to do these tasks is opening the door to her criticism.\n\nHer reaction (pouting) is exactly what I would expect from someone like her. Instead of voicing her feelings she is waiting for OP to crumble and give in. She is bring very manipulative. Don't crumble  OP.", "Yea but the problem is you can't even give people like that an inch. Day they say ye to letting them give a bottle. Wouldn't be surprised if his mom came back and said \" oh I dumped out the breadt milk you had and put some formula in the bottle so they can get used to formula, that way they can spend the night with us.\" Or something like that. Parents like his that think they know better about everything can take a task as simple as giving the kid a bottle and still find a way to fuck it up. I'm sure op knows his parents well enough that if they aren't even allowed to do the basic things, there's a pretty good reason behind it.", "People are allowed to have different boundaries for different parties. My mother isn't permitted anywhere near my wife and I. Her parents are encouraged to come visit when they have the time. Just because you would let one family member help with childcare doesn't mean you let every one of your family members have the same responsibility, does it?", "But mom doesn't have a history of being respectful of boundaries.  When she has spent OP's entire life of stomping over boundaries, 2-3 years of good behavior doesn't magically let you have the permissions you want.", "It's been a long, hard fight to get OPs mum to respect their boundaries. I can see OP not wanting to give mum any room to go back to her old ways because she's shown time and again she will. \n\nThe in laws have not stomped boundaries and therefore don't have the same hard boundaries because it's not needed.\n\nIt's the equivalent of having two dogs. One roams, refuses to come when called or follow their training. The other walks just fine, comes when called and shows it can be trusted. \n\nOne would get a short leash and less freedom than the other.  It would be unfair to treat them the same because either the bad one will have too much freedom or the good one will be too restricted and punished for good behaviour, training them to behave badly instead.", "You can't discount a person's prior behaviour in things like boundary issues is the thing. If OP has spent a lifetime of his mother not respecting boundaries then he has all the reason in the world to think he won't respect this. If his father is able and mother not able that could create even more friction", "... it sounds like you're projecting.", "Sometimes with bad past behaviour one has to earn the trust to do what most would call normal things.\n\nMaybe it hasn't been enough time for him to trust his parents with this.  He has stated he trusts his wife's parents more as they've had more experience with children and aren't as overprotective or helicopter parents.\n\nHelicopter parents are fucking exhausting.  They crush all boundaries because \"they know better.\"\nThey don't stop with their kids either, they do the same to their grandkids.  Just ask my mom.  My son is 17, graduated high school, going to college next semester, and my mom still tries to control both my and his lives.  She tries to inject herself into every single situation she hears of from anyone.  They're usually very emotionally abusive as well, not always though.  From what I can tell OPs mom has a thing for guilt tripping, very common for helicopter parents.", "Exactly, tough luck for her. She was nothing but a nuisance for OP growing up, and now, she's facing the consequences because OP doesn't want it repeated. This will be a great teaching lesson for her rather than letting her run rampant.", "What?!? Do you have a link to that one???", "so? different people have different boundaries. maybe they should consider why they are the only ones getting these boundaries instead of crying about it.", "So? Parents are allowed to decide who can and cant help care for their kid. Op\u2019s mom disrespects op\u2019s boundaries which is why she has limited ability to care/parent op\u2019s child.

Op is still letting grandma see and interact with the child", "Changing a diaper is basic childcare\u2026 which is a part of parenting.

I\u2019m so sorry this happened at all.

I\u2019m saying that OP is overreacting and being overprotective. If OP doesn\u2019t trust mom to even change a diaper I\u2019m sure they don\u2019t get much time with the grandkid or get to hold them much. The apple doesn\u2019t fall far from the tree and the irony seems to be lost on most folks here.", "Yeah it's the difference between giving the bottle or changing the diaper and giving the bottle and complaining about what type of formula it is or changing the diaper and saying this other brand is better etc etc ad nauseam.", "Yep classic narcissist helicopter parent move.  Be unwilling to change,  never respect boundaries,  then throw a fit when they don't get their way.  If there was even a small amount of maturity, it would be different. This isn't on OP to fix, it's on their mom. If she can respect boundaries she can earn back the trust she never built up while OP was younger.

I caved and let her keep my baby. I sent her bottles. My oldest had rosacea (kinda like eczema) so she could only use certain soaps and lotions and had an oral medicine from her doctor. I gave her the dosing instructions. I go to pick my baby up and she says \"I didn't give her the medicine because I didn't think she needed it\". The second time was when I told her that my daughters ears ARE SUPER sensitive like mine so she can ONLY wear real jewelry, not costume. I pick my child up and didn't notice she has earrings in. I noticed it that night during bath time. By this time, her skin has created a scab over the post. It killed me to take the earrings out. Some people are \"give an inch and they take ten miles\".

She only got upset when she realized she\u2019s the only one that can\u2019t apparently even touch the baby. That\u2019s cruel. Either go no contact or have faith mom can change a diaper without it being a fight. OP is projecting and being harsh IMO.", "It\u2019s pretty common for grandparents to be way more relaxed with grandkids. Being good for 2-3 years is a huge accomplishment. If she\u2019s so bad OP should go no contact. Instead they are punishing their mom for the past and to be fair to mom she wasn\u2019t trying to harm her child.

What do you mean that's a hazard?\"\n\n\"Oh you know allergies aren't real.\"\n\nThere is an extensive amount of damage someone can do with the every day parenting tasks if they are entirely willing to ignore the directions given by the actual parents. Evidently OP does not trust his mom enough not to stop on his instructions so he has to cut her off from parenting responsibilities entirely.", "I'd hardly call it overprotective. If the mom has been pushy for all of ops life and refused to accept and respect boundaries, why would he believe that all of a sudden she's fully flipped a switch. It's not overreacting or over protective to say \"until it's clear that you have actually worked on yourself and changed your behavior long-term\". The baby is still in diapers and most adults take multiple years of personal work to change behaviors like this. If she's still in a mindset of \"I should be allowed to do this because x, y, or z\" (which it sounds like she is) then she hasn't even actually begun to do that work on herself. Like I said there are plenty of grandparents that pretend to respect boundaries until they can convince the parents to leave them alone with the kid and then all of those boundaries get pushed to the side. With the information we have here I'm willing to bet that's what the mother would do so it's not unreasonable to make a rule to stop behavior that only she does. Since the mother is the one with the behavior that killed the trust op had in her then it's on the mother to behave in a way that would rebuild that trust. Op isn't obligated to trust someone that has already exhibited behavior that makes them untrustworthy no matter what blood they may share and trust doesn't rebuild quickly. Throwing a hissy fit over boundaries doesn't rebuild trust either, legitimately respecting those boundaries is what rebuilds trust. If you're claiming to respect a boundary but you still keep the mindset of \"this boundary shouldn't be here!!\" then you are not actually respecting the boundary.", "Exactly, so why take the risk?

OP is allowed to have boundaries in place for their child at their own discretion, the mom doesn't get a say. She can either accept what is being given to her or get nothing at all.
