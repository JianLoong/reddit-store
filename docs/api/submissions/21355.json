He's our first child.\n\nI have a good relationship with my parents, however, they (especially my mom) have a difficult time respecting my boundaries, and they were a bit overprotective of me growing up. I am their only child, so naturally they are going to feel protective of me. While I wouldn't go as far as to describe my mom as a helicopter parent, she seemed to have a hard time allowing me to make mistakes. She would want to have a say in anything I was doing, and offer advice whether I wanted it or not. When I was little, this was totally understandable, but as I grew up it became very annoying. When I moved out, I told her that now that I'm grown up, she needs to respect my boundaries, as well as accept that I might do certain things differently from how she does. I've requested that she please ask me if want help/advice with something, and to please respect my wishes if I say no. She seems to have a very hard time with this; she'll reluctantly say she'll try to do that, but honestly I don't think she's making enough effort. We've argued about this many times. It really feels like she doesn't trust me. When my son was born, I asked both of my parents to please leave the parenting up to me and my wife, and if we need help we'll ask. They agreed, though my mom seemed reluctant (not surprised).\n\nNow, I didn't think it was my place to ask my in-laws to do this, because they're her parents, not mine. I told her that if she would like her parents' help/advice with raising our son, it was fine with me, and the decision of how much or how little involvement her parents had was up to her. I am also more comfortable with my wife's parents because she's the youngest of four children, and therefore they have more experience as parents. They know when it's appropriate to offer help, and when they should take a step back.\n\nAnyways, today we're having a barbecue for the 4th of July. We invited both of our families. It was the first time we've all been in the same room since our wedding. My mom saw how much my in-laws were helping with our son; feeding him, changing him, putting him down for a nap, etc. (they're mainly doing this because my wife is busy in the kitchen). My parents took me aside and asked why I want my in-laws' help but not theirs. I told her the reasons. Dad took it pretty well (he enjoys being a \"fun Grandpa\") but my mom is very hurt. \n\nNow I feel bad. I was looking forward to a fun day with our families, but now I'm feeling guilty. My mom basically is just standing around doing nothing and looks hurt. My feelings of wanting her to leave the parenting up to me and my wife hasn't changed, but I don't know how to express this without upsetting her.

I get why you don\u2019t want her second guessing every parenting choice you make or mixing in when your child struggles with something but she\u2019s not allowed to interact with your child at all? I understand boundaries and you should set them but does it have to be all or nothing?", "It's one thing to say that you want your parents to stay out of any parenting decisions, but it sounds like you've pretty much asked them to not lay their hands on your son. Feeding and changing are basic care - why can't they help with that?\n\nIt sounds like your mum is trying to stay within the boundaries you've set but is upset that your in-laws don't have the same/any boundaries. I can understand why she's upset.\n\nYour children are your parents only chance to be grandparents, and you've decided they're not going to get much of a chance to do anything. You complain that your mum was too controlling in your childhood - it seems the apple didn't fall far from the tree.\n\nFind a better balance.\n\nYTA", "ESH there is a difference between not wanting your mom to parent and excluding her from helping at all with your son. Boundaries are great and I completely understand having them when your mom is sooooo overbearing/overprotective however, there is a difference between her changing his diaper while your wife is busy and her criticizing you for bottle feeding over breast feeding or something similar. Your mom should talk to you about it like an adult instead of pouting but it also sounds like you are going a bit overboard.", "Before leaping to any conclusions, there is one person whose voice is equally important in this situation - your wife.\n\nWhat is HER take on your mother's role with your child? Is she comfortable with the boundaries you have drawn? Does she, in fact, prefer those boundaries be in place and that you are managing the situation as you are?\n\nIf you are taking the role of protecting the both of you from your mom's undue interference, then NTA - BUT you also have to accept that the consequence of that boundary-holding is exactly what happened at your family gathering, and your mom's feelings getting a bit hurt. \n\nIt will take her a while to re-learn new behaviours, so I would advocate patience patience patience with lots of talking and more patience with each other. As long as you and your wife are both on the same page, I am sure you will figure things out. \n\nCongratulations on your new baby OP.", "I really think YTA. Initially when you said you wanted them to allow you to parent I was with you but the things you described your MIL doing were not parenting tasks. Those were tasks anyone close to you and your child would be allowed do. I understand not wanting her to but in with opinions but why can't she change a diaper or put the kid down for a nap.\n\nIt more sounds like you've tried to push her out of your kids life and keep her apart like she's just an acquaintance.", "I\u2019m going to go with NTA.\n\nSome people don\u2019t know when to quit, so it\u2019s best not to let them get started. It could also be in how the advice is delivered.\n\nWe tried to let all of our parents do the same things with our son, but it wasn\u2019t working out. Some weren\u2019t good with safety, some ignored how we wanted things done, etc. \n\nIt sounds more like your mom doesn\u2019t treat you as an adult, or at least struggles to, and your wife\u2019s family doesn\u2019t have that issue. That is going to cause some problems. \n\nI would maybe sit down with your mom and tell her as she gets better with understand and respecting boundaries, you two (three with your wife) can reevaluate what you\u2019re comfortable with.", "INFO: Does your mother have a strained relationship with your wife? Has she stomped boundaries with her? Been excessively critical? Not taken the time to develop a real relationship?  If the answers to these questions are yes, then N-T-A, what you sow you reap. In that case a perfectly reasonable response would be \"W and her Mom have figured out how to work together respectfully.\"\n\nBut if what is happening is that you are projecting your problems with their relationship into your own, then Y-T-A.", "NTA\n\nFrom your description I imagine you worry letting your mom in on these things would start to result in a lot of opinions about what you\u2019re doing wrong or should change when it comes to feeding, diaper changes, naps etc. Seeing how hurt she was you could always try to give her a small chance with very explicit rules and then pull back if she can\u2019t follow them, but I understand not wanting to after you feel like you\u2019ve given her so many chances in your own life. From your dad saying he likes to be the \u201cfun grandpa\u201d it doesn\u2019t seem like your parents don\u2019t have any access to your kid, they\u2019re just not involved in caregiving tasks.", "NTA your kid, your decision. Your mom showed you she has a hard time respecting boundaries....that is a pivotal element for trusting people with your first child. Remember: this is your first child, you as well are allowed to learn.", "YTA. \n\nThere is absolutely no reason why your mom can't feed or change the baby or even put him down for a nap. That is not her \"parenting.\" And if your boundary is \"leave the parenting duties up to the parents\" then yes, that needs to apply to your in-laws as well. Or you should have been parenting your child while your wife was busy. Why wasn't that an option? \n\nYou hurt your mom. You made it seem like not helping was how you and your wife were raising your child together and it turns out it is the way you are raising your child but not the way your wife is raising your child.  Parallel parenting doesn't really work with a married couple.", "YTA - if you're going to have different attitudes to different parents (by the way, more kids does not = better help automatically!) at least make sure nobody's feelings get hurt in the process. You should have been doing all that stuff if your wife was busy and letting your in-laws (your guests!) relax.", "NTA", "YTA because you are punishing your Mom in her Grandmother role for what you believe are mistakes that she made raising you.  You need to find a way to forgive your Mom for those and allow her to step into her Grandmother role while also respecting your role as parents.  You shouldn't have taken a all or nothing stand with her as that is what is seems like you did.\n\nHolding a baby, playing with a baby, changing and feeding a baby is what grand parents do.  Don't rob that from your Mom.\n\nAnd BTW - for all those hang ups that you have of your Mom, ask yourself did you turn out alright overall?", "NTA. I feel you. I didn't have kids but I have an analogous story. Early in my engagement I had to call my parents and tell them to back the fuck off. They were making me and my partner insane. My in-laws were fantastic and I welcomed their help. My dad got it and was proud of me. Mom was hurt. Tough shit mom, you made that bed.", "Kind of YTA.   Why can't your mom feed the baby  or change him\n\nIt's not like she changes him because she doesnt like his outfit, or moves his bassinet  to another room, or rocks him to sleep when that isn't your routine.\n\nGive your mom a chance to learn the boundaries.", "YTA towards your parents. I can see why they felt hurt seeing the other grandparents doing things you\u2019ve said they can\u2019t, that was really crappy of you.", " Some of us have parents who are still children themselves and have to be in control.  Been there.  Just judge what works best for your kid as parents should be talking to you and respecting you as an adult not as a child.  If they can\u2019t then they end up like your mom.  NTA but give parents the chance to change and be part of your family\u2019s life", "Yta - this is exactly what you wanted, right? Your mom out of it. She's out of it.", "Wow, YTA", "ESH \n\nYou\u2019re not inviting her in at all. She can\u2019t hold him, change him, etc? Why?", "YTA. I think you may have overcompensated by making your parents not have a relationship with your baby. It\u2019s an honor for grandparents to be involved. I\u2019m not saying they should ever go against your wishes. But why can\u2019t they help take care of him?", "Probably your mom also wants to go home and cry.\n\nYTA", "YTA. Your mom sounds super protective and a bit intrusive of your decisions from what you said. But she doesn't sound like a bad person. You gave her limits and that's fair, but maybe your limits are just a little too harsh when she's even uncomfortable to help in basic needs of the baby. Yes, YTA and a big one.", "YTA. For not having these rules with both sets of grandparents.", "INFO can\u2019t you throw them a bone here and let them do a bottle or help with a bath or be with you while you put the baby down for a nap? Even as a teen, my aunt let me give my baby cousin a bottle - that wasn\u2019t me parenting. It was just a nice gesture to include me. To be honest, this would cut me to my core if my sister (2 kids) wouldn\u2019t allow me to do anything for my niblings but her in laws had 100% access. If they had actually violated a boundary and you then imposed it, it would make sense. But you aren\u2019t even giving them a chance to do the right thing.  Of course, it\u2019s your choice, but man this is harsh. At the very least, don\u2019t have them over at the same time as you\u2019re in laws. It\u2019s like you are trying to rub it in their face.", " Some of us have parents who are still children themselves and have to be in control.  Been there.

Like if op allows her to do that then she'll feel entitled to do more", "Man I feel like peoples responses are going to heavily skewed based on whether or not they can empathize with OP. \n\nBeing raised by a guilt tripping, boundary stomping mother I can totally understand his hard boundaries. \n\nThere is no balance because he has a life time of her not respecting his decisions as an adult and has given up trying to reason with her.", "Honestly I feel like this is a case where you have to trust the son to know his mom best. My MIL can participate in childcare how we prefer, my own mom can\u2019t do anything without having the dissenting opinion. We feed our son wrong (we follow the recommendations on BLW and don\u2019t hand feed him), his clothes are the wrong size (no they\u2019re not, my mom just thinks that clothes should always be oversized), we do naps wrong, we should use a different brand of diapers (my son is allergic to a lot of diapers) I breast fed for too long, etc. If he doesn\u2019t think his parents can participate in care within their boundaries, then I think he\u2019s right to tell them not to", "I think puting his son over his mom's feelings is always going to make OP NTA.
