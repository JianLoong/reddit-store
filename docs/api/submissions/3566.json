I told her that I would order it before I left for work so by the time I got home it would be there.\n\nShe texts me back and said that\u2019s fine, but to please order cheese pizza. I asked her why and she said she didn\u2019t really enjoy the topping I usually get which are super normal things like pepperoni, or bacon (mind you this is the FIRST time I\u2019m hearing this, she has eaten pizza with those toppings before) so I\u2019m like okay is there like ANY toppings you would like to eat on you\u2019re pizza as opposed to just having it plain because at that point it\u2019s just not really doing anything for me or filling that craving I had for some pizza. She said no that she just wanted plain pizza. I told her well if I\u2019m buying it I\u2019m going to get what I want on it and suggested that she could pick off the toppings if it bothered her that much or that we could do a sort of half and half deal where half was cheese.\n\nThen she said that she could still usually tell or taste residual flavors or oil from the toppings when she did that and didn\u2019t even want to do that, and said we could just order an entire other pie for her\u2026 neither of us are going to eat an entire pie so that just seemed frivolous to me so I said let\u2019s just forget the pizza idea and scrap it as a whole. Then she started telling me that I was being a jerk and really inconsiderate and I told her I sort of thought that she was being selfish a little bit and now she\u2019s very upset with me and isn\u2019t speaking to me\u2026 AITA?", "created_utc": 1669775928, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z8eo91/aita_for_refusing_to_order_plain_cheese_pizza_for/", "score": 3495, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Like not even a small one? I'm honestly confused", "We do in my house. Husband and daughter eat meat. I can\u2019t eat pepperoni, sausage, or bacon without it triggering a migraine.", "Meh, I\u2019m a firm believer that arbitrary timelines shouldn\u2019t dictate with what you\u2019re feeling. Have French toast for dinner. Ramen for breakfast. Mimosas at eleven pm. It\u2019s your life! Embrace chaos! \n\nSincerely, \nSomeone who hates breakfast food at breakfast but will eat it anytime else", "I get the feeling they\u2019re mad about the two pizza suggestion because that means leftovers and no new fresh dinner from the gf the next night too.", "This is what we do.  He gets his pepperoni and black olive (yuck) and I get whatever I want.  We both get dinner and then lunch the next day.  But really a small cheese pizza is generally pretty cheap it wouldn't have been much to just add it on  to the order.", "It's how I feel for really spicy foods, not just \"hot\" spicy, but foods with very strong seasoning, like curries.\n\nI get tired of people asking why I don't like my food to have flavour.  sometimes, I want to enjoy the taste of, say, teh actual beef, not eleventy one spices and herbs.", "most vanilla flavorings we see today have very little or no vanilla at all.  It's mostly petrochemical synthetics.  Real vanilla is exciting.  Vanilla flavoring, not so much.", "I'm like this. Cheese pizza, vanilla ice cream, plain hamburger, etc. It actually makes it super easy to compare places. People think I'm weird but it's just the way I prefer it.", "I can't upvote this enough.\n\nDude buy a plain cheese pizza and put pepperoni slices on it, if it's not manly enough for you.\nBtw bacon is NOT a normal pizza topping.", "I make a cake with real vanilla beans. It's my most popular flavor. Real vanilla is amazingly flavorful.", "the other day I learned that \"spicy\" means \"spices\", not that it's \"hot\". can't believe it took me that long! I have a lot of unlearning to do as a white person and food is just one of them.\n\nI agree, there's a time and place for everything!", "I can understand her refusal to that. My dad would make half pepperoni half pepperoni and olives and you can taste the olives on the slices closest to the olive half. So I understand her not wanting half and half since the taste of his toppings could still bleed onto her half.", "Using toasted Ametican oak in the secondary adds the most delicious vanilla flavor to mead. If done right!", "Yea, I'm a vegetarian and my husband isn't so when we order pizza it's usually half meat and half plain, but I always inevitably end up with a little bit of his topping on the slices that touch his half. I'm not personally bothered by this and will just pick it off, but I wouldn't judge someone who was bothered. Best cast scenario, go half and half. Worst case, get two pizzas and gf doesn't have to cook tomorrow either. I have 100% over-ordered takeout so I would have leftovers the next day, and pizza is one of the easiest and most reliable leftovers.", "Me too. I hope this doesn't make you too jealous, but I've got two great pizza places in my street, and another 2 or 3 just a few blocks away :D", "He says taster *cups* so I get the impression it's like a child size cup instead of just a teaspoon.", "YTA. If she really didn't want to do half and half (picking off toppings you don't want or like doesn't stop the taste from being there, she's right about that) then suck it up and get 2. That's perfectly fine that neither of you will eat a whole pizza in one sitting, put it in the fridge and heat it up! It's shocking how easy it is to compromise and not be an ah. Relationships are not \"its my way or no way\" that's what you do when you're single.", "Happy wife happy life, next time, get the pizza and some pussy. Treat your queen right.", "YTA for not grasping that your girlfriend eats pizza she doesn't like to be agreeable and the one time she asks you to do the same, you tell her to kick rocks.", "Literally though \"first time I've heard this\" yeah probably because of the reaction that she knew you would inevitably give such as just not getting pizza at all, and then posting on Reddit because you still don't see how you're wrong.... Insufferable lmao", "And called her lazy for not wanting to cook even though she usually cooks \ud83d\ude44", "OP is a unwanted topping on his GFs pizza", "YTA.  Seriously. Pick your battles. What\u2019s a cheese pizza cost? $5-10? Just order it along with the pizza you want. Or if you\u2019re too cheap to do that, do half and half. Such a non-issue that you made an issue.  \n\nWait til you have kids. Plain cheese pizza will be all you ever get.", "This too. I had focused more on the \"what is the problem with half and half\" bit, but medium pizzas exist, and just... pop the rest in the fridge for later, which is half the fun of ordering pizza.", "Cheese pizza, every night.", "I hope she makes him only tiny cheese pizzas", "he should order 5 X Large pizzas and eaten them\nover the next few days bc he won\u2019t have a gf to cook for him anymore lol", "Seriously 5 min in the air fryer at 350, sometimes it\u2019s better than when it\u2019s fresh.", "I'm sorry, but how do so many people like leftover pizza? Not trying to shame what you like or anything, but to me it tastes disgusting.", "You really can still taste all the toppings residue and half the time toppings end up on the cheese side.", "We do. We even have things called personal pan pizza\u2019s at some places too, we have 3 sizes of pizza at most places but OP is being an AH and decided no dinner is some how the smartest option when he gf didn\u2019t feel like cooking for him.", "I caught that too - when she doesn't want to cook, he calls it being lazy. He doesn't seem very open to compromise, and this isn't a good sign in general.", "And it\u2019s not like she stays home while he works. She works too, she just gets home earlier than him. He should be more appreciative of her being willing to cook for him after getting home from work. And he should be willing to buy her dinner as well on the rare occasion she doesn\u2019t have the energy to cook his royal highness a home-cooked meal. He sounds inconsiderate af.", "I bet if vanilla were associated with a color besides white, it wouldn't have that reputation. Which is weird but somehow makes sense to me. I do love when you can see the little specks of vanilla bean in ice cream, though.", "The flavor can certainly spread.  OP can order 2 small pizzas, and have the rest tomorrow for breakfast.  YTA!", "Not just pork oils, but some veggies can release flavor into the other half of the pizza that might not be appetizing for the person eating that. \n\nCase in point: cooked bell pepper gives me horrid indigestion. Even the taste of it makes me sick. (raw I can eat all day!) My husband loves bell pepper on his pizza. We used to do the 1/2 and 1/2 but majority of the time, my half would have either stray bell pepper all over it or the flavor of bell pepper because it was too close to actual pieces of the peppers. And then I don\u2019t eat it. So when he wants bell pepper, we order 2 smaller pizzas. It might be a few bucks more expensive, but there\u2019s no fear of flavor contamination.", "I do something similar with new Thai places always ordering the Pad Thai to see if they're worthy", "See, good vanilla bean is AMAZING, so the whole \"all these options and you get something boring\" logic doesn't even stand. It's more like \"picking something that is extra good if done well, and this is a fancy place where it's probably done well\".", "I also hate pepperoni pizza, but it's my husbands favorite, so we just do 1/2 and 1/2. I've honestly never had an issue with the flavor running to my side, but maybe the place they order from has exceptionally oily pepperoni?", "Not just that but the tips too. That's why I never do half and half when I'm ordering, and I'm sad when a work function only does half cheese with something else \ud83d\ude15", "I poured Tito\u2019s over a bunch of cinnamon sticks I found in the pantry and let it sit for 6 weeks. Gave some to my sister - she adds it to her coffee.  I use it in french toast because the ground cinnamon does not mix well into the eggs.", "Ahh, ok.\n\nI have no idea if [this person here](https://turnkeyparlor.com/your-ice-cream-business-cost-per-scoop-analysis/) is an authoritative voice on ice cream retail costs, but dude estimates an all-in cost of $0.63 per every 4-oz scoop of ice cream. I'm going to just wildly guess and say that a \"taster cup\" is like maybe a half-oz? Some more quick half-assed googling seems to show that most kitchen ice cream scoops are ~1 oz, so a half of a normal home-sized scoop seems like a reasonable sample size. (I mean, maybe. I dunno, I don't run an ice cream shop.)\n\nSo let's call it an $0.08 cost per sample served\u2014so I guess that'd be a mere 3,750% profit margin on sample cups.\n\n(Assuming any of these numbers are right, because i pulled them more or less from my ass.)", "Right! 2 small pizzas and they each have leftovers for lunch or dinner!  What could possibly be easier?", "IDK, I'm inclined toward ESH here. Going half-and-half seems like a reasonable compromise and I'm really not buying: \n\n>Then she said that she could still usually tell or taste residual flavors or oil from the toppings when she did that and didn\u2019t even want to do that\n\nLike, what? Arguing over pizza to his extent like this seems like a red flag to me for this relationship. Both parties seem to want control here.", "YTA. Why not get two smaller pizzas so you each have the one you want? My husband and I order two and not even from the same place. I get vegan pizza but he doesn\u2019t like the non vegan pizza from the vegan pizza place, so he gets a regular pizza from a completely different place. The world of delivery is at your finger tips. There is 100% no reason everyone can\u2019t get what they want.", "YTA\n\nThis is a completely useless fight you two are having. Just order two damn pizzas. One plain for her and one with the toppings you like. Really. Fucking. Simple. Everyone wins. \n\nIgnoring this super simple solution is a very odd hill to die on.", "My husband and I always order two 10\u201d pizzas, one for him with his gross black olives and pineapple and one either plain cheese or BBQ chicken for me. We never finish both but then that just means cold pizza leftovers which are the best! YTA, she always cooks for you, the least you could do is order her the pizza she wants.", "YTA. You know you can get toppings on half a pizza, right? Just get it half plain.", "You're a huge asshole. You don't get to dictate what others eat because you've offered to pay.\n\nHow could you even wonder why she hasn't mentioned anything before if this is your childish reaction?\n\nUgh.", "Not only that but OP doesn't have a fridge or oven/microwave? Like, \"neither of us can eat a whole pie.\"\n\nOh no! If only there was some way to store the remaining pizza for later consumption.", "Take an award.  \nOrdering a second pizza is logical. \nDo better next time,  OP.", "What is this \"leftover pizza\" you speak of? I have never heard of it.", "Pineapple does this, when it's removed it still leaves that acidy taste behind.", "Here we just ask for half cheese and half with toppings!", "toppings on half is the better value play... small pizzas are a fucking racket lol.", "Listen, I struggle to eat in the mornings at all due to a medical condition. If I force myself it doesn't end well.\n\nYour breakfast is valid af, and I personally give you permission to tell anyone who gives you crap to fuck right off.

The higher the butterfat in the ice cream base the higher the cost by a lot. And adding quality flavorings are also expensive. Real vanilla bean is not cheap. Your numbers probably work for Burger King or McDonald's level ice cream. Sonic and Culver's are excluded from your numbers already and they are still fast food. Specialty places? Food cost is probably around 30% if they manage it well and then you have significant labor costs. Most of those places struggle tbh.", "I got those numbers from a rando site on the Internet. I don't know shit about how to run a restaurant, fast food or otherwise.\n\nBut I _do_ know that $3 for a \"tasting cup,\" even if it's an entire half-oz of ice cream, is a pretty bold fuckin rip off.

Just that.\u201d*\n\n*Historically, the spices I have in my cabinet are an embarrassment of riches. I have there a large container of whole black peppercorns which I grate fresh over my food.

Kings and emperors have not eaten food so well spiced.*\n\n*I have vanilla ice cream in my freezer (cold! frozen! when the rich would pay fortunes to send for ice from mountains to chill fruit in the summers).
