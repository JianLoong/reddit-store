Today she was feeling lazy and didn\u2019t really have any ideas for dinner (no big deal) so I told her I had been craving pizza and wouldn\u2019t mind ordering that for dinner and she agreed. I told her that I would order it before I left for work so by the time I got home it would be there.\n\nShe texts me back and said that\u2019s fine, but to please order cheese pizza. I asked her why and she said she didn\u2019t really enjoy the topping I usually get which are super normal things like pepperoni, or bacon (mind you this is the FIRST time I\u2019m hearing this, she has eaten pizza with those toppings before) so I\u2019m like okay is there like ANY toppings you would like to eat on you\u2019re pizza as opposed to just having it plain because at that point it\u2019s just not really doing anything for me or filling that craving I had for some pizza. She said no that she just wanted plain pizza. I told her well if I\u2019m buying it I\u2019m going to get what I want on it and suggested that she could pick off the toppings if it bothered her that much or that we could do a sort of half and half deal where half was cheese.\n\nThen she said that she could still usually tell or taste residual flavors or oil from the toppings when she did that and didn\u2019t even want to do that, and said we could just order an entire other pie for her\u2026 neither of us are going to eat an entire pie so that just seemed frivolous to me so I said let\u2019s just forget the pizza idea and scrap it as a whole. Then she started telling me that I was being a jerk and really inconsiderate and I told her I sort of thought that she was being selfish a little bit and now she\u2019s very upset with me and isn\u2019t speaking to me\u2026 AITA?", "created_utc": 1669775928, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z8eo91/aita_for_refusing_to_order_plain_cheese_pizza_for/", "score": 46, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
