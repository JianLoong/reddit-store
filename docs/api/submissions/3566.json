I told her that I would order it before I left for work so by the time I got home it would be there.\n\nShe texts me back and said that\u2019s fine, but to please order cheese pizza. I asked her why and she said she didn\u2019t really enjoy the topping I usually get which are super normal things like pepperoni, or bacon (mind you this is the FIRST time I\u2019m hearing this, she has eaten pizza with those toppings before) so I\u2019m like okay is there like ANY toppings you would like to eat on you\u2019re pizza as opposed to just having it plain because at that point it\u2019s just not really doing anything for me or filling that craving I had for some pizza. She said no that she just wanted plain pizza. I told her well if I\u2019m buying it I\u2019m going to get what I want on it and suggested that she could pick off the toppings if it bothered her that much or that we could do a sort of half and half deal where half was cheese.\n\nThen she said that she could still usually tell or taste residual flavors or oil from the toppings when she did that and didn\u2019t even want to do that, and said we could just order an entire other pie for her\u2026 neither of us are going to eat an entire pie so that just seemed frivolous to me so I said let\u2019s just forget the pizza idea and scrap it as a whole.

I\u2019m not seeing the part where you give a reason you think you aren\u2019t?", "YTA and I hope she leaves your sorry A", "Just get 2 pizzas and eat left overs for lunch.", "YTA, even my young child knows that you can order a pizza with toppings on just half. This is moronic.", "Yta ever heard of half and half", "yta, add an order of cheesesticks if you dont want to order an extra pizza", "Info: why couldn\u2019t you get half plain or two pizzas?", "My mother loves all things chocolate, and my dad hates chocolate. My mom didn\u2019t know this about my dad until they were married, because my dad loved making my mom happy and would let her order dessert and happily eat whatever she ordered. It makes me sad for your gf that she is with someone with such little regard for her taste and for making her happy. I hope she finds better. YTA.", "Can you not order smaller pizzas? Get a couple of seven inch or ten inch ones?", "You can order a 1/2 and 1/2 pizza \ud83c\udf55 1/2 cheese, 1/2 the flavor you want.", "How about just putting toppings on half? Even if some \"stray\" the majority of her half would be plain. Also, she has been eating pizza your way all this time AND making you dinner almost every night? YTA and selfish!", "I'm just confused why he can't get her a whole pizza. He says she won't eat it all but like.. leftovers?", "But 1/2 and 1/2 is perfectly reasonable.", "Op offered a half and half deal?? I feel like this is a solution to the entire issue and she didn\u2019t take it", "And when she doesn\u2019t cook she\u2019s been eating his pizza preference the rest of the time!", "She's not gonna taste the toppings if it's half and half. If he only offered the pick them off option yes, but NOT when the damn toppings have never even touched her side of the pizza. It's a completely decent compromise.", "Because OP never makes dinner and has been ordering the pizza he wants all the time which GF doesn't want. GF has already compromised, now its his turn and he should get her what she wants.", "Where do you think we are?", "The oil and flavors of the toppings spread on a half and half pizza.  She doesn't normally ask for a separate pizza, but this *one* time that's what she wanted.  Since she cooks most of the time OP should let her get what she wants this *one* fucking time.", "He said he suggested that and she said no to half and half", "She didn't want a half and half because the grease and flavors of the toppings spread to the cheese half while it's cooking.  That's reasonable.  OP is an ingrate and very much TAH.", "Am i taking crazy pills? OP literally says he offered to do half and half and she rejected. I can understand tasting the oils and flavour after picking off toppings, but I'm not buying the whole \"they seep over to the other half while baking\"-thing someone is saying. Half and half is a decent compromise, it IS unnecessary to buy two pizzas. Everyone is saying greedy, these are tough times, maybe OP is trying to be frugal? Two small pizzas cost more than one large. And just because she cooks most days does not necessarily mean OP doesn't do his share of other things - we just don't know anything about this.", "My husband and I get two if we order because he likes plain cheese and I like toppings. Then we both get leftovers for another day or two. It\u2019s a win-win imo so I really don\u2019t see the problem doing that other than him being cheap.", "Leftover pizza is hands down my favourite breakfast of all time", "I usually get a full pizza for myself. Because the pizza is loaded with cheese I'm full after two pieces. I just eat the rest later that day and the next day and give some my boyfriend to snack on. Unless they really only habe money for one pizza (in which case they shouldn't order it or at least get the margherita since it's cheaper than one full of toppings) it's ridiculous to order just one pizza for both of them when there's clearly a conflict.\nAlso at least where I am there are usually different sizes for pizza. Just get two small ones ffs.", "Agree, but ordering a small plain really isn't a lot either.", "I home make ice cream. I've done a batch where I didn't add *any* flavouring, not even vanilla... That is what plain, boring ice cream tastes like, and I'm willing to bet your aunt has never ever tried it.\n\nA small scraping of real vanilla bean is delightfully rich with a delicate flavour.\n\nThough my favourite to make is Macadamia and honey.", "Vanilla is the best flavour there is. It's simplicity makes it the most versatile and goes well in almost any desert.", "Fun fact! Because real Vanilla is a relatively subtle flavour, ice cream companies will use their best batches of ice cream base in order to make the vanilla flavours - strong, overpowering flavours like chocolate, mint choc chip, rocky road, etc are made using the lesser ice cream base because the flavour masks the taste of the inferior ice cream. \n\nThe more you know!", "Cold pizza and diet Coke is my favorite breakfast choice.\n\n(Yes, I eat like a savage.)", "We still have cheese pizzas in England. A cheese pizza and Margherita are totally different.", "It\u2019s named after a Queen Marguerite, who it was created for.", "It\u2019s actually the name of an Italian princess! \n\nWhen pizza was invented, there was just one type: Margherita. And it resembled the color of the Italian flag. The inventor was so in awe with said princess that he decided to name the new dish after her, with the Pizza part only being added later.", "And they talk about Americans being dense \ud83d\ude2d", "His GF didn\u2019t want half and half because the grease and flavoring from the toppings he likes gets all over the cheese side.", "[deleted]", "Perhaps, but that is what a compromise is.  And it\u2019s such an obvious and reasonable compromise that half of the \u201cYTA\u201d comments are asking why the guy didn\u2019t just get a half and half, when it\u2019s specifically mentioned in the original post that she shot down the compromise that everyone seems to think would be so reasonable. \n\nClearly a LOT of people are dishing judgment without reading the post.", "I don't know, but it sound slike the person really deserved that YTA.", "I saw it. I'm saying don't give her a choice order half and half anyway", "In my family we always called it the breakfast of champions", "Margherita is cheaper than 1 topping? I\u2019ve never heard of that. Fresh mozzarella is expensive compared to other ingredients.", "I think it is because a lot of fake vanilla flavourings are dull.\n\nBut real vanilla is amazing, it adds so much.", "This is my husband. We will go to 31 Flavors - he\u2019ll get a vanilla milkshake. It\u2019s always vanilla. Won\u2019t even get a tester. He likes what he likes.", "your point? not eating a pizza without toppings ONE time is not gonna kill him.", "We're food twins!", "Now I\u2019m frightened \u2014 what\u2019s on cheese pizza if not mozzarella??", "In the UK in a fast food place it is plain cheese. Sometimes with Fresh tomatoes or mushrooms, but not usually.", "We also have cheese AND Margherita pizzas in England as two distinct pizzas. The other poster must not have come across many decent pizzas. I think the issue is a lot of takeaway places here will call a cheese pizza a Margherita when it\u2019s not.", "I get why. Meat on pizza leaks grease onto the pizza which ends up \u201ccontaminating\u201d the other half.", "I'm old enough that breakfast with my family only happens on rare, occasional holidays\n\nBut in my house \"breakfast of champions\" is something else that happens before you go grab the leftover pizza to eat in bed ;)", "It's usually the cheapest pizza on the menu and (in every pizzeria where I am) margherita is plain pizza without any toppings. Just the sauce and the cheese they use for every other pizza too. So why should it be more expensive if it's the excact same as a pizza salami but without salami or a pizza funghi without champignons? If you want mozzarella on your pizza here you order pizza mozzarella. But maybe it's different where you're at", "Especially as he has been having pizzza that he wants the entire time, I wouldn' tbe surprised if this is the \"FIRST time\" he is hearing aboiut this because it is the first time he ever asked her what she wanted.", "My point was that your suggestion had been addressed in the post.
