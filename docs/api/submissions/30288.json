I call him out on his double standards, he says he\u2019s sorry & he\u2019ll stop since he\u2019s been so hard me with social media.

I go as far back to see that he was saving these photos/videos the day AFTER I gave birth to our daughter. When I called him out on this behaviour I was 3 months postpartum\u2026 he said his sorry\u2019s, he doesn\u2019t have any memory of this, it won\u2019t happen again.

In addition, at the start of your relationship he was controlling to an insane degree.\n\nI get that this is a stress point in your marriage. He is away a lot, you are dealing with the indescribable pressure of keeping a small bundle alive and lacking sleep, alone. But even so, this doesn't look healthy. I know every third post on AITA recommends counselling, but you two are in trouble.\n\nFirst. His porn addiction. It has nothing to do with you. He may say it is because you aren't giving him what he needs, but that is not reality. He is likely struggling and unhappy and this is what he is doing to numb and get through, like an alcoholic drinks or a gambler gambles. It may disgust you and make you feel abandoned, but him feeling shame will actually drive him towards these behaviors and hiding it from you.\n\nSecond. Your loss of interest in him and lack of affection. This may be because you are tired. It may be because you need recovery and love. Or it may be because you don't like your husband very much. The only mention you make is that he wants \"cuddles\" more than you are prepared to give. Sort your own feelings out here. Don't make out that this is a \"him\" problem. This may be connected to his porn addiction of course, but I suspect that this is just an easy way to justify what you were already feeling about your husband.\n\nOn your question. NTA. You never have to accept touch from another human being if you don't want to be touched, and that includes husbands and wives. But your marriage is in trouble, and right now you look to be searching for ammunition and tools to break it, so either break it, and admit to yourself that this is what you wanted, or try to find the actual problems and fix them.", "NTA\n\nI think your husband has a lot of issues within himself that has projected onto you with checking his social media and search history. He also seems to be gaslighting you into thinking you may be at fault here with no reciprocating physical affection. \n\nI think your husband should return to therapy and I also think maybe therapy for yourself may help you reflect on the marriage as a whole. I think you\u2019ve been incredibly strong up until this point but you can only carry on for so long", "YTA\n\nFor staying in a failed marriage. It isn't good for you and certainly not for your baby.\n\nHe has projected his failings onto you because he doesn't want yoh to do to him what he does to you. He will never change.\n\nHe keeps doing it because there are no bad consequences for him.", "NTA for that but YTA for staying in such a toxic relationship AND having a kid with him", "NTA. But seriously you should rethink the relationship. What is the point of being married to someone who disrespects you like that? It even seems like in your mind and heart you know you are already over. \n\nThere are so many red flags, first maling you unfollow people and give him your passwords when you did nothing and its just his insecurity. To me that is enough reason to walk away. The thing is when a person does not trust you not to cheat there is nothing you can do to convince them otherwise. Then he resorts to being controlling which is super toxic and seems like his insecurity is just an excuse to excert control. \n\nThe second offense is he clearly has some issues, maybe a porn addiction? I'm not sure what these issue are, but what I do know is that he is doing nothing to fix it and he is disrespecting you, his wife and mother of his child. \n\nThe third strike (which should mean he is out) he then turns to blame YOU for it. Newsflash the problem is not that he is not getting enough \"cuddles\" the problem is he is  insecure and  controlling person with a disordered sexuality. Do you really want to be married to this guy? Do you really want him raising your child?", "Definitely NTA, but consider your worth, seriously. I wouldn't touch this man either. With a 10 foot pole.  \nYour feelings are valid, and it's crystal clear that you've been dealing with a whole lot of emotional turmoil and disrespect from your husband. Honestly, you deserve so much better.  \nIt sounds like you've been incredibly patient and understanding, giving your partner multiple chances to change his behaviour. It's heartbreaking to read about the constant betrayal of your trust, especially during such a vulnerable time postpartum. You have every right to feel hurt, frustrated, and fed up.  \nI totally get that leaving a relationship, especially one with history and a child involved, is an incredibly tough decision. But please, consider your own worth and your child's well-being. You both deserve to be in a loving, respectful environment.\n\nIf you're still hopeful and willing to give it one last shot, insisting on couples therapy is a good idea \u2013 I always recommend Gottman. However, it's important to be cautious. While therapy can be beneficial for many couples, it's not a guaranteed solution, especially if your partner isn't genuinely committed to change. In some cases, therapy might provide manipulative individuals with the tools to continue their harmful behaviour, using the language of therapy to deceive. If your husband doesn't show sincere willingness to change during therapy, it might be a sign that leaving this relationship is the best choice for your well-being and your child's.\n\nRemember, your happiness matters, and you deserve a relationship that uplifts you rather than constantly bringing you down.", "NTA\n\nOh heck no.  He went from \u201cyou\u2019re right, this is a double standard, I\u2019m sorry\u201d to \u201coh I\u2019ll stop this time, I promise\u201d to \u201cwell it\u2019s your fault I\u2019m looking at these people, because you don\u2019t put out enough!\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s not going to change.

That man has no intention of changing or taking real responsibility.", "It doesn\u2019t matter how many times you cuddle he won\u2019t stop. He\u2019s shown you who he is and you are refusing to believe him. NTA, get your ducks in a row and let him live his sad life from a distance.

Why the hell would you want him touching you?\n\n\n\n>since he\u2019s so frustrated cause he only gets \u201ccuddles\u201d x1-2 per week cause it\u2019s tough working away\n\n\n Never mind, all your problems can be solved by his magic dick /s", "NTA, but why are you still in that relationship.", "YTA to yourself. You are in a relationship with an abuser who hides his abuse behind \u201ctrauma of being cheated on\u201d. You got pregnant and gave birth to a child from a man who doesn\u2019t care about you and sees you as an object for his pleasure. And you are denying the truth that his porn addiction will not stop and he will cheat kn you (emotionally ag the very least). \n\nIf you don\u2019t leave him and save yourself and your child from him, you will be a massive asshole.", "NTA \nIt\u2019s natural to want to work on your relationship when you love someone. But you need to understand when it\u2019s time to stop, and honey, it\u2019s time to stop. \nYour husband does not respect you as a person. \nTell me something, what kind of person goes around telling their partner what to do when they don\u2019t have the decency to reciprocate that? The kind that is controlling, hypocritical and a little misogynistic. \nIf he cannot respect your feelings and/or your boundaries what makes you think he can love you?\n\nMoreover, he is setting a bad example for your child because given the amount of space and opportunities you\u2019ve given him to change and he\u2019s still not taken them seriously, I doubt he\u2019ll do that in the future. \n\nYou said he\u2019s done therapy in the past, was he unaware that entire time that he\u2019s addicted to porn? If he was aware, why hasn\u2019t he done anything to overcome this? \n\nI understand this is your marriage, and it is ten times more serious when there is a child involved, but you need to think about this for the sake of your child, if not yourself. What kind of man do you want around your baby?", "Nta. Your husband needs help for sure  but it is time to let him walk with his own legs. There's no need to pursue this self-destructive relationship now that you have a newborn to take care of.", "Come on grl, lordy what a stinker. I mean there's things on the net 24/7 and men are going to look. \n\nIt's a losing battle with a man who can't stop himself. Get you and your baby out before you can't,  he will never stop. Do it before baby and dad have any more time to bond. Find a man who respects you. You will. Sorry to break your heart. \n\nThis is not going to end well. You already know this", "NTA it sounds like he may have an addiction and doesn\u2019t want to do anything about it. Even if it\u2019s not to that point he only cares about his own needs and has shown you that repeatedly. Get out.", "NTA. You really need to shit or get of the pot though, he's making no effort to change and when you call him out on it he turns it around and blames you for his actions. Either you accept that this is who he is or you leave, making empty threats solves nothing.", "NTA. Whether your expectations were reasonable or not is beside the point. You described your boundaries. He agreed to them - twice - but then continued regardless.\n\nThe point isn\u2019t whether he should or should not be \u2018allowed\u2019 to look at those kind of photos. It\u2019s rather an issue of trust. Don\u2019t agree to something and then fuck around regardless.", "Have to agree. No consequences.", "Wait...

Get used to it.", "Maybe you can have an agreement that he can watch porn but no cringe stalking at instagram, which would include deleting his account. Saving this pics is a heavy sign for addiction and the need to feel being in control. It could really be that having regular sex would help him, but it doesnt make any sense if it makes you uncomfortable.

Your husband is a liar. Move on.", "I vehemently disagree that the wife is the asshole here. This is quite obviously an emotionally abusive relationship and this is another case of the victim being blamed for staying. \n\nThe wife is a victim of years of gaslighting, lies, intense control and manipulation, and calling HER an asshole for staying is essentially blaming a victim of abuse for not leaving. Most people don\u2019t want to blow up their lives and years invested into a relationship, and often try to work on it and find solutions because they don\u2019t yet realize they are in an abusive situation. They don\u2019t leave until it gets so bad, they reach their limit, and different people have different breaking points.\n\nIt\u2019s so easy for people on the outside to harshly judge victims, and this makes it harder on victims by adding shame for not leaving to the mix and making them feel stupid, emotions they already feel about themselves thanks to the abuser. I can\u2019t tell you how many times I\u2019ve heard the words \u201cJUST LEAVE\u201d said with rolled eyes when validation and support would have been so much more helpful. It took 6 months of planning, saving and secretly packing and a year and a half of contentious litigation to finally leave my abuser after over a decade. Years later and I still doubt myself for leaving and sometimes feel intense guilt for leaving him. I almost went back several times, because forging a new life has been extremely hard, but my therapist has been invaluable in helping me remember how bad it was with him.\n\nYou get brainwashed when you\u2019re in an abusive relationship; it\u2019s like a cult of two where the abuser tries to make you doubt your reality, perceptions, confidence and self-worth, and over time their tactics erode your sense of self and decisiveness away. You sympathize with your abuser and want to see the best in them, and the cycle of abuse where they are nice and make steps to change makes you think things are finally getting better, so you stick it out.\n\nPlus you often have family, financial, social and, in some cases, religious or ethical pressures to stay.\n\nVictims of abuse aren\u2019t assholes for not leaving their partners; they are victims of years of control, manipulation, love bombing and gaslighting. Many people stay in abusive relationships due to self esteem issues, manipulation, financial abuse, trauma bonds or other reasons that make it difficult to leave (like an expensive housing market).\n\nOP is NTA, she is trauma bonded to her abuser, and people shaming her for staying just don\u2019t seem to understand how hard it is to leave an abusive relationship.

I ended it almost 2 years ago and couldn\u2019t be happier.", "Hi Rosiebees, it isn't my judgement, it is her husband's. I think it is extremely variable between different couples, and I absolutely don't have an opinion on what is too much, too little, or just right. It also changes constantly through a relationship. He was connecting his porn problem to her unwillingness to be intimate more than 1-2 times a week. I think they aren't causally linked.", "Er... no. My advice is that husband's problem are his, and likely very little to do with OP. OP is mostly writing about her husband here, not her own experience, and only touches on not wanting to be touched, does not explore the reasons why in much depth. Which is probably better in a vounselling session than here anyway, or with a very close friend. If she doesn't want to be touched, then don't let him touch. If she wants out of a relationship, then get out. If she wants to work on it, then work on it.\n\nI wrote a long post. Sorry if you are reading judgement of OP in there. It was not intended. And ultimately, like every other keyboard warrior, my thoughts and advice is my own. OP gets to use or ignore it. If it helps, great. If it is entirely off base, then hopefully other advice also exists.", "Oh c'mon, he's been doing this for years, it has nothing to do with post baby \"cuddle\" times!\n\nThe thing the other commenter didn't tell you that a lot of addicts don't turn their lives around until they hit rock bottom. He didn't have to face real consequences for his actions for years, didn't seek help on his own all this time. What makes you think he'll suddenly turn around?\n\nI mean sure, giving therapy and counseling a try, it is certainly not a bad idea, but don't lie to yourself. He is the one pushing you away, not the other way around.", "HE needs professional help for his porn addiction. Couples' counseling alone will not suffice. He also needs to take responsibility for his actions and for hurting you. If he's willing to do this work, there is hope. If he just wants to sit with you and a counselor and whine about all the outside forces that \"made\" him behave so badly for so long (including you, in his mind), there is not.", "Sure sounds like an addiction. Wish you all the best to get over it together!", "Agreed. He wants it to be her fault so he won't have to change his own behavior."]}
