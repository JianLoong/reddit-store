My sister in law has a Service Dog who has been with her for about six months now (he is 18mo).\n\nIt was my sons birthday party last weekend, which she was at, and obviously had a whole ton of young boys running riot around my house. My daughter also had two friends over (younger siblings of the boys) as well as pur pets. All in all there was nine children, three dogs and a cat causing chaos. At one point one of our rabbits escaped and was running around too.\n\nMy SILs dog couldn't cope. He was so excited and wasn't paying any attention to her. My daughter and her friends said hi to him but otherwise left him alone. He was losing his shit the whole time and my SIL had to leave.\n\nMy son was a little upset but overall didn't mind, just asked that she could come over for a mini birthday. \n\nYesterday was that \"mini birthday\". It was much quieter, just the family, and the dog was still losing it. He was jumping around and she wasn't able to control him. She had a flare up which he ignored.\n\nShe got quite frustrated and asked my children to leave the room. They did and he finally calmed down. They came back in and ge got excited again.\n\nThe kids weren't comfortable so they went to play and we had a conversation. I basically said if she can't control him I don't want him in my house. She replied that he's a service dog and goes everywhere with her, so I'd essentially be banning her.\n\nI said that he was a shit service dog as he'd ignored her flare up and wouldn't listen. She then blamed my kids, saying my daughter had got him excited last time and now he thinks that kids mean \"playtime\".\n\nI told her that if her service dog can't ignore children while working he's not really a service dog. \n\nShe got upset and left, saying she was uncomfortable with me. Later on my husband pulled me aside and asked me to apologise because I'd hurt her feelings. I said I didn't think an apology wouod be worth it because I'm not sorry - I meant what I said. He told me he understood but that it's a bitchy move to not even try to apologise. \n\nShe then texted me and said that he had a \"situation\" with a child when he was in training, but she is paying out money to get him retrained.\n\nI don't know what the situation is but I do feel bad. I think she was trying to use my kids to socialise him and it hasn't worked and I feel much worse. \n\nI haven't yet responded, because I do still somewhat stand by what I said, but I also feek awful about making her feel so insecure.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1701780626, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18bba4g/aita_for_telling_my_sil_that_if_her_service_dog/", "score": 4441, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Dog IS  a lousy service dog rn - he's not doing his job at all.\n\n18 months old is very young to be a service dog too - barely out of puppyhood. What breed is he?

They are extensively trained and extremely expensive. It sounds like she got a dog and someone train it and is calling it a service dog. 18m old sounds kinda young also.", "Your husband is wrong to insist that you apologize since you did NOTHING wrong.  A dog that can't stay on task around children isn't an acceptable service dog.   This is a \"her and her dog\" problem not a YOU problem.  Not sure what type of \"flare ups\" she has but if they are life threatening rather than just inconvenient then you've done her a HUGE favor by pointing out the problems with her dog.\n\nDo thank her for letting you know that she's actively working on the DOG'S problems and that once the dog is retrained they are both welcome to come back to your home. \n\nNTA", "My parents have adopted multiple dogs that did not pass service dog training.\nThe first dog had an incident with a child during training, and it was the reason that the dog failed out of service dog training. \n\nYour SIL's dog is not a real service dog if it can not do its job in a high-energy situation, whether children are involved or not.", "So was this animal sourced from an accredited kennel with a certification in training service animals?

And most of them won\u2019t have the future handler training them, because then the trainers would be training the handlers to be trainers, and then the dogs as well. \n^^\nThey go through a period after their training where they are familiarizing themselves with their new handler, and that does come with training, but it\u2019s not the same as the extensive training that the trainer did with the dog. And by then, the dogs are most definitely socialized. \n^^\nIf the future handler was also a dog trainer, I supposed they could train the dog themselves, but then this whole situation would have been handled completely different. Trainers know you don\u2019t remove the situation from the dog, you remove the dog from the situation. That did not happen here. The SIL asked the kids to leave, she didn\u2019t take the dog away to calm down. \n^^\nIf this dog had an issue with kids during its service dog training, and that issue wasn\u2019t able to be corrected, ***no reputable service dog company would have allowed the dog to pass the certification and allow the dog to be adopted as a service dog.*** \n^^\nIf this were a trained service dog, I would say the owner would be an ass, but they also technically have every right to not allow animals in their own private home. In this case, the term \u201cservice dog\u201d is being glaringly over-exaggerated, and the homeowner has every right not to allow a hyperactive dog in their home.\n^^\nApologies if this comments ends up being a brick wall after I press the button, I\u2019m doing this on my phone.", "Info- is it an actual service dog for a medical condition/physical limitation trained(special training) to perform a specific task?\n\nOr is it an \"emotional\" support dog with literally no training and she just takes it everywhere anyway? \n\nI am in no way saying that emotional support animals are not needed and perform a valuable service- I AM saying that people who slap an \"emotional support\" label on their pet just to bring their pet everywhere without any proper training(even regular obedience training) are Dicks.\n\n My son was in the process of getting a service dog, he was in the last phase of getting to know the dog and taking him public places a bit to see if they would be a good fit together(the dog trainer came along with her own service dog for these sessions). If all went well, the dog and him would be matched officially. The organization was very strict with their vetting- which is a fantastic thing when it comes to service animals.We were all at the mall one day- me, my son, the trainer, and my friend and our group was attacked by a fake service dog who went crazy with 2 other dogs and an autistic little boy who were close to him. My son was making noise but wasn't causing a huge ruckus. The service dogs rushed to protect their owners and got between their people and the other dog. Long story short both service dogs got seriously injured and had to be retired, my friend and son were emotionally traumatized with my son being disqualified from having a service dog from that organization because of his new severe anxiety around dogs, and my wrist was injured trying to get the mutt off. The owner tried to sue us because his dog got put down by animal control- saying we ought to know better than to \"harass\" his dog(ie my son making stimming noises etc) and that we ought to know not to bring other dogs near his \"service dog\"\n\nSo, I hate fake service dogs with a passion.

Service dogs have to be able to focus on the person they are serving - especially if they\u2019re having a flare up.\n\nAs for if she was hoping to use your family to socialise the dog; a chaotic children\u2019s birthday party is the worst way to do that. And if she\u2019s been looking to work on that then you needed to be involved.\n\nI don\u2019t think you owe her an apology, and if anything I think it\u2019s a good boundary to not apologise if it isn\u2019t genuine.", "Unfortunately medical response animals don't get the training most service dogs do, and don't have \"accredited training centers\" nor do they have \"service dog papers\" what that means is any sam dick or harry can run around saying \"I'll train your puppy to be a service dog and give you this harness I bought on amazon and BOOOM you have a service dog!\" then you get an 18 month old puppy who isn't trained who can't handle kids and ignores things it should alert to. you're NTA but whoever your SIL is paying to train her bloody dog is. \n\n(this does not mean there ARE NOT good trainers who do their job out there, there are some VERY REPUTABLE medical alert trainers out there you just need to find them. And they are NOT CHEAP)", "NTA. The dog is not yet a *TRAINED* service dog. And I agree that the dog is not quite old enough. Most dogs I know left puppy hood at around age 2.

I quickly picked up the carrier and turned to the woman, and she apologized and said oh he's just never seen a baby before. I told her that maybe she shouldn't be bringing him into public stores yet.

They took a NJ transit train into NY together, walked to various touristy places together, and all ate at Bubba Gumps restaurant.

The dogs that make the program are paired with blind and sight-challenged people. Those that don't qualify for whatever reason are then offered as other career paths, including bomb sniffing dogs.\n\nTSE puppy raiser clubs meet bi-weekly for training and practice at not being distracted by other dogs and people. They are encouraged to take puppies to varying levels of noise and distraction exposure as they get older and older.

SIL tried to use your family to help socialize a service dog that seems to still be in training and does not seem to fully grasp what the laws involved require or allow, and what they restrict. The label alone doesn't give the dog a free pass, and a misbehaving service dog can and will get her legally kicked out of businesses and public places (in the US). For that part she really needs to actually read the relevant information about the law and how it interacts with service animals, and what the ADA does and does not consider a service dog (ESAs do not count). If she doesn't understand parts, she needs to speak to an expert in those laws to help her understand. Otherwise she not only makes her own life far more complicated but invites possible legal problems. If she got a dog and is self-training, as I would guess by the dog's reported behavior and age, then she especially needs to not only learn that portion of the law but also needs to get on top of the dog's training ASAP. The longer the dog goes on like this, the harder it will be to break the bad habits and establish the required good ones. I speak as a disabled person who has been exploring the possibility of a service dog in the future if the symptoms from my chronic illness get severe enough to require that or a human caretaker.\n\nWhen it comes to training, I think anyone who tries to use someone else to help socialize their animal without talking to the other participants beforehand to keep everyone on the same page and ensure that everyone is fine with helping and knows what to do is an ignorant idiot or an entitled asshole. Consent is huge, and she did not seek it before involving you and your family. That, and she did not elaborate what the incident she referenced was, so this dog may in the end be unsuited to service dog work if they are immediately distracted to the point of being out of control by the presence of children.\n\nOverall, intentional or not, your SIL is being an A H to herself and those around her based on the information provided. She can get hurt feelings all she wants, but is an adult and is responsible for her own choices and the consequences of those choices, and \"feeling bad\" is not an automatic pass on that responsibility. As an adult, she is responsible for her feelings and if she feels bad because of what she did, it is up to her to make amends, and she is not entitled to forgiveness of those she wronged or hurt. If her dog does anything, as its handler she is 100% responsible, and laws about service animals will not protect her if a bad enough incident occurs. Ignorance of those laws will also fail to protect her if a bad enough incident occurs, especially if she has knowledge of prior incidents with this particular animal and children. To save herself, SIL needs to work around her feelings and get on top of things yesterday.  \n\n\nEdit: noticed typos & missed a point", "That\u2019s not a proper registered service dog.

Also it can take years to get a proper service dog you don\u2019t just decide you want one and next week have them. They take so long to train and not all dogs can do it so there is a real shortage.

It sounds like she may have pushed too far too fast with kids, and her dog wasn\u2019t ready for something as overwhelming as a kid\u2019s party yet.  That is at least as much handler error as it is a dog problem.  When you have a service dog and your dog is overwhelmed by a situation and you can\u2019t get them under control, the handler needs to remove the dog from the situation.  When you just sit there with the dog out of control, you teach the dog that being out of control is part of working.  And that means that if a situation feels similar to the dog, they\u2019re likely to be out of control again, because you\u2019ve taught them it\u2019s acceptable.\n\nIs your sister a first-time service dog partner?  It sounds like she needs to sit down with her service dog trainer and talk about what to do when the dog misbehaves.  I know when I got my service dog (he came to me fully trained from a service dog school), our classes mostly consisted of 3 things: connecting with our new partners, learning to train new skills, and figuring out how to get back on track when you and your dog get derailed.  It sounds like she\u2019s lacking in that third area, and she\u2019s a.ways going to struggle as a handler if she doesn\u2019t learn.  It means that sometimes you have to cut short or even skip things that you want to do because your dog is struggling.  That\u2019s one of the drawbacks of choosing a service dog over a non living device.\n\nI am a bit confused about why you\u2019re banning the dog, though.  She\u2019s going to need opportunities to work on this issue, and instead of helping, you\u2019re cutting her off.\n\nSo I guess ESH - her for not making the call she needed to as a service dog partner, you for making nasty comments and cutting her off instead of at least staying neutral (obviously asking how you can help would be kinder, and the sort of thing most folks would expect if you have healthy family relationships).", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

My sister in law has a Service Dog who has been with her for about six months now (he is 18mo).\n\nIt was my sons birthday party last weekend, which she was at, and obviously had a whole ton of young boys running riot around my house. My daughter also had two friends over (younger siblings of the boys) as well as pur pets. All in all there was nine children, three dogs and a cat causing chaos. At one point one of our rabbits escaped and was running around too.\n\nMy SILs dog couldn't cope. He was so excited and wasn't paying any attention to her. My daughter and her friends said hi to him but otherwise left him alone. He was losing his shit the whole time and my SIL had to leave.\n\nMy son was a little upset but overall didn't mind, just asked that she could come over for a mini birthday. \n\nYesterday was that \"mini birthday\". It was much quieter, just the family, and the dog was still losing it. He was jumping around and she wasn't able to control him. She had a flare up which he ignored.\n\nShe got quite frustrated and asked my children to leave the room. They did and he finally calmed down. They came back in and ge got excited again.\n\nThe kids weren't comfortable so they went to play and we had a conversation. I basically said if she can't control him I don't want him in my house. She replied that he's a service dog and goes everywhere with her, so I'd essentially be banning her.\n\nI said that he was a shit service dog as he'd ignored her flare up and wouldn't listen. She then blamed my kids, saying my daughter had got him excited last time and now he thinks that kids mean \"playtime\".\n\nI told her that if her service dog can't ignore children while working he's not really a service dog. \n\nShe got upset and left, saying she was uncomfortable with me. Later on my husband pulled me aside and asked me to apologise because I'd hurt her feelings. I said I didn't think an apology wouod be worth it because I'm not sorry - I meant what I said. He told me he understood but that it's a bitchy move to not even try to apologise. \n\nShe then texted me and said that he had a \"situation\" with a child when he was in training, but she is paying out money to get him retrained.\n\nI don't know what the situation is but I do feel bad. I think she was trying to use my kids to socialise him and it hasn't worked and I feel much worse. \n\nI haven't yet responded, because I do still somewhat stand by what I said, but I also feek awful about making her feel so insecure.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Temperament testing of young pups is of only limited usefulness. The pup one has at 4 months, may not be the pup one has at 12 months or at 18 months.  There's issues that don't even become evident until the pup gets closer to adulthood (full mental maturity is usually around 2 years of age).  \n\nThe training for service work requires a dog who already has the foundations of self-control, focus and judgement. Immature dogs can be goobers and it's best to allow them to get that gooberness out before going into training.  Asking for too much mental maturity too soon is a good way to ruin a potential service dog. \n\nA future service dog does get a lot of training before starting learning his job but it's pricise and careful socialization plus laying the foundation for advanced training.\n\nAnyway, I have major doubts that OP's sister got a service dog in one week.  It's not like there's Service-Dogs-R-Us stores with a full selection at any old time.  Not just any dog can do service dog work and it takes time and experienced trainers to find one and match it correctly to a disabled person.  \n\nWe have a lot of puppy raisers for Seeing Eye in our area and I'm always impressed with the pups. They tend to be remarkably steady, calm and thoughtful. The guide school trainers have high standards and there's dogs that are rejected for minor reasons for seeing eye work.  These rejects are still extraordinary dogs and many are passed to other service dog work.  Some are allowed to be adopted by the puppy raisers and there's a few who become available.  They are in extremely high demand.   \n\nIf OP's SIL's dog is a future service dog, she's setting it up for failure.

At the first sign of over arousal, the pup and handler move away and work on regaining composure and focus.", "Most professional SD training agencies don't even start training their dogs until they're at least 18 months, many wait until they're 2 years old.  Before then, the goal is just to make sure that they get solid obedience training and then exposure to as many unique situations as possible.  It's certainly possible for a service dog to need a bit of a refresher, and the initial adjustment period when one goes home with their new person can occasionally spur on some less-than-desirable behaviour, but the agency should be aware of that and have support available for the person who the dog is meant to support.\n\nI agree that this seems like a case where either the dog flunked out of training or it wasn't an agency dog at all and OP's SiL thought she could train it up on her own.  Even if that's not the case, she's almost certainly either not being honest with the agency about what's going on or isn't following their advice on how to manage the regression (or both).  None of which excuses her blaming the behaviour on the kids, and none of which means that OP should welcome the dog back into her home until there's good evidence that the behaviour has been handled.\n\n(Though I would encourage OP to teach her kids not to even acknowledge a service dog while it's working.  Although a well-trained one should be able to return to attention once the stimulus is gone, having kids \"say hi\" to it can still be distracting and momentarily break it out of work mode.  It's certainly not as big a deal as SiL is making it, but still good practice to gently correct the kids and teach them proper SD manners.)", "Even if it's a well trained dog, exposing them to that kind of chaos is asking for a laps in training. 3 dogs, a bunch of rambunctious kids, and then a rabbit gets loose?

Excessive barking, aggression, inappropriate urination, etc. So if you have someone come in who claims to have a service dog, but the dog is behaving badly, you can tell them to leave\u2014 even if the person keeps insisting it\u2019s a service dog, that doesn\u2019t matter, because bad behavior negates the privileges of a service dog.\n\nThis is in place to allow people to train their own service dogs, because professionally-trained dogs are cost-prohibitive for most people. Service dogs are functionally medical equipment and this puts them in reach of people who ordinarily cannot afford assistive equipment. \n\nIn my opinion, it\u2019s a pretty good law.

Anyone who behaves badly can get told to leave. It\u2019s only discrimination if you kick them out because they are an animal (and even then in certain circumstances you can still kick them out).", "That\u2019s because it creates an expensive barrier that makes having a service animal inaccessible to most disabled people. \n\nPeople who rely on government assistance for their disabilities in the US (specifically Medicaid) are usually living at or below the poverty level.", "Ada does not apply to private family gatherings in someone's home. It could be the most legit service dog ever and OP could kick her and the dog out without legal consequence", "For a business yes, but OP isn\u2019t a business and neither is her home. Even if it was a service animal she is allowed to ban it from her home. This isn\u2019t a matter of legality.

That includes obedience, socialization, and task or work. That dog's \"ignore\" is severely lacking.", "A friend of mine worked to start a legitimate service dog training group:  CHAMPS .  They are located in St Louis county. They train a specifically chosen dog for  specific client.  The dog is free to the client.

As a parent, if my kids did something they weren't supposed to, that was my fault.", "People just don't like being told no so they think service dog is a cover all shield they can hide behind with their obvious PET. I always notate in our front desk log \"Rm XxX has a 'service dog' in it\" but maybe I can prevent these folks from checking in. Another big issue is they don't tell you until they're in front of you, five states away, with their fur baby. But I'm thinking about incorporating these questions into my reservation process. Doesn't help with online/third party but it's something at least.", "Yep, I agree that the term service animal is being abused, and I do see a ton of stories (anecdotal I know) of people trying to pass off their pet as a Service animal, but it is what it is...lol", "I\u2019m aware. I\u2019m simply stating that asking is illegal. That\u2019s why I said especially for businesses. I was more focusing on that because a lot of people think you can just ask in public/in a business when it\u2019s not the case.", "It doesn\u2019t sound like the dog is unsafe?

Every morning I wake up she jumps around the house waiting for me to pet her and take her outside. \n\nShe listens to me almost always except when any of my family members visit and she gets so excited and is so desperate for their attention I may as well not exist lol. \n\nI love her and she's the best companion dog ever but she just couldn't pass SD training (though she does alert me before I have an episode).", "A friend of mine fosters service dogs in training for one of the professional service dog groups. They go with him to restaurants and lie quietly under tables, they walk in public, and in general they are habituated to early dog skills.  Then, when they're old enough, he surrenders them to the professional trainers and starts all over with another dog.\n\nThe goodbyes are hard on him, of course.

He was always asked to sit and once his butt was on the ground the person approached. If he broke his sit, the person moved away. He realized pretty quickly that jumping, bouncing, or doing anything that took feet off the floor meant no attention from the person. \n\nWatching him say hi is hilarious. He\u2019ll drop his butt on the floor and then scoot forward until he can lean on the person. He\u2019ll lift his head and tilt back for throat scratches and cuddles and head/ear scratches. It\u2019s been fantastic and it was so heavily reinforced when he was a puppy it\u2019s now habit that he\u2019s older. I love how politely he greets people but it took a lot of work and a lot of patient people willing to approach and back off before rewarding him with their attention. The one problem I\u2019m having now is how he solicits attention. But it\u2019s minor, I just say \u201cCap, check\u201d and he immediately makes eye contact with me and gets a reward. He\u2019s getting better but he does love trying to get folks to give him attention when he\u2019s training or out in public! He\u2019s my very own little social butterfly. \n\nIt\u2019s not too late for your dog!

There have been a lot of stunts, like one journalist who brought all sorts of ridiculous animals into all sorts of inappropriate places, then wrote an article about how badly behaved her emotional support alligator was and how people put up with it because they thought it was a service animal.", ">its not illegal to ask for credentials\n\nJust to reiterate: In the USA, there's no such thing as service dog credentials.\n\nA reputable charity could issue paperwork saying that they trained a dog properly etc, but that wouldn't be official in any way.", "He says it got excited. You\u2019re right the incident could have been anything, but in the service dog world that could have been a kid running up to the dog and grabbing it and now the dog gets hyped when kids are around. I\u2019m just not sure \u201csafety\u201d is the main concern. \n\nEither way it\u2019s not well trained and needs retraining before it can be around kids again.", "Yep, my dad does it. Guide and autism dogs. One ever one at a time, and NO ONE even starts any form of real training before a year. At the year, they move to their next stage but I've been to their \"graduations\" and they're all fully aged dogs by then. Not 18mth old pups.

Was a great well mannered puppy outside this but dangerous.  \n\nHe was - even by service dog trainers - a perfect candidate.  I exposed him to everything I could just to get him to that year mark and he was doing super great.\n\nLosing him was, devastating not just age - but just how well he was doing.\n\nThen my second attempt no one would leave alone, no matter what I did. He was great with people, but soon as I taught him to ignore someone else (adults and kids) ran up to him.   At 18 months the trainers said he was not viable.  And that was it.  He's in a happy home as a pet now, and around 7 years old?  The new owners were just surprised at how well trained he was. \n\nI've given up at current - and may do it again in the future - but you are fully right that Ops sister is setting up the dog for failure.", "I was a k9 handler (explosives) for a private company.  We used purpose bred dogs (german shepherds and Mals) for our company but we bought another k9 company that mostly uses guide school drop outs for detection work.

A friend fostered seeing eye dogs and she was told not to play with balls so her dogs never chased balls since that wasn\u2019t something they had ever done. Kids were different. You can\u2019t avoid kids when you take your dogs for a walk so that needed a different approach where behavior was corrected.", "I want to think SD2 provided guidance to SD1 when on break from working for their human.", "Some guide dog schools - Guiding Eyes for the Blind for example - retain ownership of the dog so if something happens they will take the dog back and find it a home. I think most guide dog schools would help out if you asked.", "Most people I know were able to keep up the task training.  It\u2019s the public access excitement that was the big issue for many.  It wasn\u2019t hard to work through, just needed a bit of patience and practice, and time to do it.  Human adults, I noticed, had the same trouble as the dogs!
