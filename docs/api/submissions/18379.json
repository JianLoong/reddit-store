Guy is out there supporting the family - we have no idea what he does; could be a fireman or a laborer or any number of underpaid under-respected brutally taxing fields.  Maybe he does deserve a medal.  He should respect his wife but there is no basis here to minimize his contribution to the family", "Yeah I agree he\u2019s the AH in this limited situation.  I just always find myself offended on behalf of the unrepresented party in this board.", "Kind of like implying because she had a baby she can complain all she wants instead of them working together like couples should and solve the issue.\n\nWow they both have responsibilities, everyone gets a medal (or metal in your case).\n\nHow about instead of complaining nonstop they compromise? She can pump milk and he can feed the baby throughout the night, or they take turns. Damn, look at that! Now they are both getting some sleep and she isn't repeating herself!\n\nHoly shit, its like relationships and parenthood are all about compromise...everyone gets medals!\n\nEDIT: and just gonna block you since you're stalking me", "How have I never heard of this what", "That is unfortunate. People have also been killed by seatbelts, pain killers and peanuts.", "I agree that Dad sleeping in another bed until the breastfeeding phase is over is a good solution to OP\u2019s problem. Regardless, I stand by what I said - bed sharing is not super dangerous and to say as much is uneducated.", "You see it as a solution, I do not. Comprising on what is best for an infant and new mother is not a solution in my eyes.", "My bad! I read it wrong. I was just thinking 4yo breastfeeding? Yeah that\u2019d definitely hurt your back!", "But objectively in this moment he is being selfish and thoughtless. We only have this post to go on so responses are going to be in response to that. If there was a whole bunch of other behavior listed maybe it would be worded differently. But in this situation, he is being selfish and thoughtless and there's nothing wrong with pointing it out. That's *literally* how comments sections work.", "Japanese people sleep in such a wildly different way than we do. We barely even sell mattresses firm enough for safe sleep in America, and I've never heard of someone buying a new mattress just for cosleeping, they just say theirs is firm enough. It's not.", "I totally get where you're coming from, and I'm not trying to say he doesnt do anything, especially finacially supporting the family, but that's not all a father, or a working parent is supposed to be. Being a parent is putting in the work and the effort, marriage is supporting your partner, even in parenthood. It just sounds like he's prioritizing his own sleep and comfort and then minimizing her exhaustion because its annoying. Raising a baby is also work.", "Maybe lay off Reddit or this sub for a while then, if it \"triggers\" you so much.", "That's an extremely lazy rationalization. I'd also call it dangerous if they were giving an infant peanut butter, excessive amounts of painkillers, or put them in a car with a standard seat belt.  \n\nYou can very easily reduce the risk of a baby being suffocated by their sleeping parent to 0.", "How about what's best for the family?\n\nYou completely disregarding the father is shameful.", "Definitiv and not only the back, I'm sure. \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "Agree, he should respect his wife and her burdens.", "You are very obviously purposefully misconstruing what I said. It doesnt make you correct and it doesn\u2019t bolster confidence in your opinion.", "No, it is not shameful. There are seasons in the life of a family. This is a season that prioritizes the mother and child.", "You don't see it as shameful, I do", "I can\u2019t understand that. How could any decent husband or wife not want to prioritize an infant and new mom.", "I don't understand how someone who has a fraction of the whole picture could say all the nonsense you're saying...but I guess that's why we will never see eye to eye.", "You also have a fraction of the story and seem pretty confident in what you think the whole picture is...\n\nYou are also making assumptions based on things you dont know..."]}
