I will admit it was extremely hard and the longest time of my life because of my lack of sleep. What did I do? I started pumping and building a milk bank in the freezer. That way when I was too exhausted to breastfeed husband could take over and I could rest. I also got me a bigger mattress, so we would all fit comfortably. \n\nMy vote will be NAH. This is his bed that he uses to sleep too, so you should be adjusting yourself and kiddo before he gets to bed so is less of a problem. Also, I know for a fact that when someone is complaining about something constantly - yet not attempting anything to fix the issue, it is aggravating to constantly hear the same complain over and over.\n\nSo where you're not really 100% an AH for complaining, he has reached the end of his patience for this complaint and is time to look for solutions.", "INFO: Why do you have to move over when he comes to bed?

Mom should pump a little bit after each feeding to create a supply for a bottle feed. If dad tends to be up late, you do the evening breast feed and then go to sleep. Dad does the next feeding.

Developmentally, the baby should be sleeping through more of the night, even if you are co-sleeping, which I hope you are doing safely. It's time for the two of you to sort this out.

Maybe a therapist can get you to understand each other's method of communication.", "Its amazing how many prople are jumping on the co-sleeping thing. That is not what this post is about. \n\nFor the actual question I am going with ESH. Yes he could be more supportive. But you said the baby is 6 months old. Honestly if my spouse was complaining about something for 6 months I would get fed up too. And since you are both sleep deprived then both of you are going to be snappy and irritable. It probably does irritate him that he has to fight for bed space all the time when he just wants to go to sleep too. Then be griped at for it. Day after day week after week month after month. That stuff adds up. But from the post it doesnt sound like you have done much to alter things to compromise on the situation. Both of ya'll need to get on the same page and figure out what can be done to help with the situation instead of just complaing about it all the time.", "I can see both sides of this. You are choosing to breastfeed. You mention that you have to move so he can lay in his own bed to sleep. Maybe put your child in one of those co sleeping bassinets that position against the bed?\n\nI can understand his frustration but he should also be supportive of you and maybe have a conversation with you about those frustrations.", "ESH.

Personally, moving our baby from our room was one of the hardest and most beneficial things we did as young parents. When everyone is sleep deprived nobody is really thinking clearly.", "ESH, STOP COSLEEPING. That's super dangerous.
