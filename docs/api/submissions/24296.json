I was excited, I always wanted to be a mom, he was not, confessed he had children and his oldest was older then me, along with a wife. I said I was keeping it, so he better tell his wife or I would. I would never sleep with a married man knowingly. I feel extremely guilty, and had a long talk with her. They decided to continue their marriage.\n\nMy babyshower is coming up, and my baby father texted me asking why his wife still had not gotten an invite. I was just like wtf? Why would he want his wife there? I said I wasn\u2019t inviting her, it felt wrong and awkward to me. I said I wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable at my own shower if she was there. He then said I\u2019d be a horrible person if I didn\u2019t invite her, since I had already slept with her husband and now I am keeping her from her stepchild\u2019s baby shower.

He's chastising you for not inviting his wife to the baby shower?  Let's see who has made the bigger mistake ..... I'm going with him - married boss sleeping with an employee!\n\nBut, be careful.  If he's already announcing that you're keeping his wife from her stepchild so he might have plans to try for custody of the child.  I'd speak to an attorney if I were you.", "NTA. That would be super awkward and uncomfortable for everyone. You might want to take this opportunity to establish what if any boundaries you want to set where the wife is concerned. This could be a sign that your ex wants his family wife to be an equal mother to the baby. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they petitioned for full custody at some point. You\u2019re a young, first time mom and they\u2019re an a older, established couple who have raised kids. If you\u2019re not careful with them, they could completely take over and try to minimize your role in your daughter\u2019s life.", "NTA. Why does my paranoid mind go right to \u201chis wife and him have an agreement to stay married and take your child from you to raise it as their own\u201d \nHe\u2019s trash and just bc she\u2019s staying with a lying, cheating loser doesn\u2019t mean she gets an invite to your baby shower or has any day in your future co-parenting relationship.", "NTA - Remind him you were put in this horrible situation because he was a cheater. You have no desire to have a future with his wife and because of the baby, you're stuck with him for the next 18 years. The family he did not tell you he had has no right to your life and child and they are not invited.", "NTA. That would be weird as fuck to invite his wife. \n\nBack when I was stationed in Yokosuka, Japan, I was seeing a Japanese woman. About 3 months into it, she invited me to her birthday party. After I agreed, she said that I could meet her husband and kids. I noped out of there.", "NTA. You\u2019re willing to be cordial with her - because you\u2019re an adult - but you don\u2019t need her there at your baby shower. Bizarre this even came up.", "Maybe Dad should have his own baby shower. He can invite his wife to that one. After all, he's going to need all the baby gadgets, just like you.\n\nNTA.", "INFO: are you inviting the husband and not the wife? or are you inviting neither husband or wife?\n\nYou should probably get used to the idea of her being around whenever the husband is around. She's probably not going to love the idea of you spending 1:1 time with her husband given your history.", "NTA - This is a weird ass request. There will be plenty of time for her to hang with her stepkid. You are not wrong saying no.", "NTA: your boss is delusional, if he thinks it would be a good idea to bring his wife, to his mistresses shower. Your safety is paramount above all else", "NTA. It's your baby shower, not an event for him and the women in his life. I've never heard of anyone in her situation demanding a place because she'd be the future stepmother. That feels icky. \n\nForgive me, but it's like he's trying to bring his marriage partner into your celebration (and into your womb) to make up for his cheating. Gross. Keep them both away.", "NTA.\n\nSucks for this kid.", "uh no, WTH? NTA.", "NTA for not wanting your babies StepMother there, but you didn't even have to tell baby daddy you were having a baby shower at all. I'm sure he would assume you'd have one but why tell him at all? You do not need to really deal with him until after the baby is born. You are coming off as very young which you are and na\u00efve. The only hookups with you in a hotel, huge red flag that he might be married. I do wish you Good Luck.", "Is he going to want her in the delivery room? WTF?? NTA", "Get an attorney now! \n\nCause based on the post and your comments about the delivery room, to me it feels like he\u2019s going to fight for full custody and right now they\u2019re using you as a surrogate for the baby. This whole thing feels icky and you need to protect yourself and the baby. \n\nEither this is what\u2019s happening or I\u2019m watching too many Lifetime movies!", "NTA\n\nThis is freaking weird. You didn't even know this woman existed until after you were pregnant. Just no.", "What single guy needs to use hotels? You\u2019re life is going to be hell. I hop you\u2019re ready for it. NTA and don\u2019t invite anyone that you don\u2019t want there.", "NTA, but she did nothing wrong and will be your child\u2019s stepmother and their children are your baby\u2019s siblings, so you\u2019re going to need to mature quickly and understand that she will be caring for the baby, too.", "OMG HE WANTS YOU TO INVITE HIS WIFE?!? \n\nNTA, but he certainly is!", "NTA - she probably doesn\u2019t really /want/ to be there either. It\u2019s not your responsibility to make help him save his marriage that he put at stake.", "NTA. But now is the time, well before the baby's born, to work out what your relationship with the baby's father and his wife is going to be, and seek legal counsel if you need to. You definitely don't need to invite her to your shower but you do need to think 1, 5, 10 years down the line and decide to what extent they're going to be involved in your life.", "NTA, but also I would get a firm parenting plan and big boundaries in place ASAP. Don\u2019t need him trying to get the Mrs in the delivery room or anything.", "Get an attorney ASAP. I've read your comments and they are...concerning in regards to his behavior. He wants his wife to be in the delivery room!\n\nI would be very, very concerned that he might go for full custody. Get all your documents together, too, when you talk to the lawyer.", "Considering that she may be involved in his life for the next couple of decades, wouldn\u2019t it be prudent to establish a cordial relationship with her now?\n\nShe wasn\u2019t the cheater.  She didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\n\nThis might be a great opportunity to strike up a bond that will prove useful.\n\nPlease don\u2019t treat her as the offending part of this trio.\n\nMention to her that the invitation is late because you were concerned about her and the awkward factor.  Give her a chance to decline the invitation.  Take away any ammunition that might be used for bad blood in the future.\n\nJust curious, how did the baby daddy learn of this shower?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's best for your baby in the grand scheme of things, if everyone gets along and can at least be marginally friends. I wouldn't go announcing to everyone the whole situation since it's no one's business, but shunning her after all that the two of you have put her through isn't the answer, IMO.", "Rather than focus on who is or isn't invited to the baby shower, it is time to sit down with the 2 of them and as what is up. Sounds like she wants to take an active role in the child's life. The 3 of you need to have the custody conversation. \n\nYTA if you are looking at the larger picture here.
