Months ago we'd promised we won't masturbate  behind each other's backs, but he never trusted me so I told him he can check my phone after consulting me whenever. I did try to check his phone in front of him once but he'd take it back as soon as I touched it so I never tried It again.\nHe was so distrustful of me he'd hide all my toys which is still happening.\nRecently we did however agree that it's a stupid rule and we can both do whatever we want when it comes to this stuff, so we allowed each other to essentially do stuff alone.\n\nThat's why him checking my phone without a valid reason hurt, but I still feel like since I allowed him in the past it wasn't adequate to be mad and change my passcode so I might be guilty.

I've done this after he went through my phone behind my back. He has done it in the past and I allowed it then, but the rule we had about it is not going on anymore.

Sounds like this guy who is dating a girl he has no business dating based on age is a weirdo control freak. 32 years old and he's giving you the silent treatment because you masterbated? You might as well be dating an evangelical teenager.", "NTA. Once the rule that gave access to something is no longer a rule, access is revoked. \n\nBut girl you need to run far away from that man. He's 32 and grabbing his phone out of your hands while lurking through your phone and he's still hiding your sex toys? This dude is a control freak who feels entitled to your body, privacy, and property. No grown ass man needs to be out here acting like this. Get out.", "NTA.  He\u2019s playing a double-standard.  He can check your phone any time he wants, but you cannot touch his?  That\u2019s BS.  \n\nTell him that he can either trust you or not, and that all rules go both ways.", "No, he was the asshole for violating your privacy. I would advise you to change your passcode regularly", "NTA\n\nHe has no right to go thru your phone. That's disturbing controlling behavior. He should be an ex boyfriend as of tomorrow.", " NTA: I think your boyfriend is super insecure if he's hiding your toys. Also, what kind of rule is it that you guys won't mbate? You say \"behind each other's backs\" as if it's something you guys need to keep secret from one another, it's not as if you're cheating on each other if you do. But you guys should discuss whether watching adult content can be seen as cheating, as some couples do. This sounds as if he's insecure in his skills with you in the bedroom, maybe that he can't get you off or something. The fact that he was iffy on letting you see his phone but didn't mind going through yours while you were gone leads me to NTA. You guys should discuss this more.", "NTA. I don\u2019t get the rule of not masturbating behind each others back. That just seems\u2026weird to me. Like someone controlling when you can or can\u2019t have \u201cyou\u201d time seems like a quick slide to controlling other parts. But that being said, there\u2019s a lot of red flags going up when he checks your phone but won\u2019t let you do the same. It sounds like he\u2019s up to something on his phone and is projecting it onto you. Good luck girl!", "Girl, this is a scary relationship. The age gap, he doesn't let you mastubate by yourself (wtf?), and has double standards about privacy. Please get somewhere safe and  then dump him", "Dude, NTA. Everyone has a right to their own privacy, and do their own thing when they\u2019re turned on. Especially if you both agreed to it. But also, a factor to consider would be how long y\u2019all have been together. However, him grabbing his phone after you touch it is another red flag \ud83d\udea9", "NTA. He should have asked you first- you told him that he can check your phone after consulting you. Instead he waited until you weren't present and (in my opinion) invaded your privacy.\n\nIt's unfortunate that your BF is insecure to the point of being a weirdo and hiding your adult toys, and sneaking onto your phone when you weren't looking.  top of that he's a hypocrite for calling you an untrustworthy  asshole.", "Yeah\u2026\n\nGet out of there, ASAP.", "NTA. \n\n1.  You\u2019re too young for him. The age gap is not the issue. The stages of your lives is. \n\n2.  He doesn\u2019t trust you. A relationship is nothing without trust.", "NTA he\u2019s fucked", "NTA. Your bf is controlling, manipulative and insecure. Going through your phone and checking your browser history is a complete red flag and you were right to yell at him (he was lucky you didn't dump him.on the spot).\n\nAlso the whole not masturbating behind each other's back is ridiculous, that is no way a form of cheating and just another way of controlling you (I'm sure it was more his idea than yours).\n\nSeriously consider ending this relationship or it will damage your mental health and self esteem.", "NTA. You are in an abusive relationship and what is he doing with someone so much younger. Dump the creep and find someone closer to your own age that will treat you with respect. One of the secrets of my 20 year relationship is we stay out of each others devices, hobbies ect.", "Run!!!!! And remember your sex toys - that stuffs expensive!!!

Not letting you go through his phone (edit: even in his presence), but waiting until you're in the bathroom to go through yours.\n\n4. Holding whatever he found there over your head.

He\u2019s controlling you and he is holding you to a different standard than himself. He can look through your phone but you can\u2019t look through his.

But that is for you to decide and maybe notice that old red flag shop outback.", "NTA\n\nJust an aside question as I don't understand - you said that you both \"promised we won't masturbate behind each other's backs\". Do you, or does he, consider masturbation to be like cheating, or not being honest to other?\n\nOr does it depend if you masturbate while viewing porn that it becomes unacceptable?", "NTA\n\nWhat's more clich\u00e9d than an immature, insecure older man who is way too controlling of his younger girlfriend?", "NTA\nThe age difference isn't an issue.\nHis lack of trust is the issue.\nTrust is the most important thing in any relationship.\nAlso, he sounds very controlling which is a big red flag.", "NTA I would advise leaving him no trust=no relationship", "NTA \u2026the rule was he could check your phone **after** consulting you.

This guy is manipulative & controlling. One rule for you & one rule for him? How about NO.\n\n2. Masturbating is normal & in no way cheating. If you getting pleasure from toys is making him insecure, that's an issue he needs to work on.\n\n3. Why does he not trust you? Trust is something you give, not something someone \"earns\". No healthy relationship comes from a starting point of having to earn anything. If he has Trust issues from previous relationships that isn't your cross to bear.\n\n4. Long term - is this the sort of partner you see yourself living with, marrying & raising a family (if that's something you want)?

You're allowed to have privacy and you're allowed to masturbate.\n\nI read adult content and I would honestly be mortified if my husband read it.

I get off on reading porn that aren't actual kinks I have in my own sex life so it's uncomfortable for me to talk about.\n\nIt's super normal to maintain some privacy around that kind of thing - and super abnormal to try and control your partners masturbation habits.", "All of this. ^^^^\n\nHis behaviour is not ok. \n\nOP you are NTA\n\nReddit is always quick to jump to the suggestion of ending a relationship but in your case, I really think you should consider it. \n\nThis is neither healthy nor loving.

As a soon to be 28 year old woman. There\u2019s a reason why women around his own age won\u2019t date him. He sounds manipulative.", "It doesn\u2019t make sense at all. You can touch yourself and use toys, because it\u2019s your body and you\u2019re not cheating or doing anything bad. If he\u2019s uncomfortable he has to take a long hard look at himself and decide if he\u2019s ready to date again or not, but he can\u2019t tell you what to do with your body. That\u2019s controlling and wrong.\n\nAnd mocking you (???) for what he found snooping on your phone is vile. Honestly, if it was me I\u2019d be terminally turned off, no way the relationship would go on.", "It doesn't make sense though...He has no right tell you what to do with your body. Read what you typed out loud, and tell me it's not ridiculous. If a friend came to you with this story, what would you say? As others have mentioned, he sounds controlling af, and there's a reason why he's dating someone so much younger. Women his age wouldn't put up with this bs, you shouldn't either. There are men out there who will treat you like you deserve. They won't check your phone, won't manipulate you, and treat you with respect. Dump this dumbass. This isn't going anywhere positive. Unless he is able to acknowledge what he's doing is wrong and fucked up, and wants change. We all know that won't happen...So unless you want to live like this for the rest of your life, get out now! He's shown you who he is.", "How can you type that out and not see the problem? Masturbation is a completely normal thing to do.", "Think about if you want this to be the rest of your life. Because you will never be able to change him, and he will never respect your body. Damn. Dating young is sad."]}
