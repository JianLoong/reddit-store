Playing sports is a normal and healthy part of childhood, when the child chooses to play.  Your reasoning for denying your son a rewarding part of his life are a) horrendously selfish and b) flimsy AF.  It\u2019s normal for a kid who plays sports to have injuries appropriate to the sport, and won\u2019t raise the specter of abuse unless you have obviously wrong things like handprint shaped bruises showing up.  I\u2019m very fair skinned and have a genetic disorder that makes me get bruised and cut easily (didn\u2019t get diagnosed until age 25), and I played soccer from about age 7 through adulthood, and rarely had anyone ask about my sports-related injuries.

You are an AH regardless!\n\nMy STBXSIL kicked out my daughter (his wife) and 3 kids so he was free to sleep with the babysitter.  Daughter moved in with us and has been here since.\n\nThe oldest child, LOVES sports - something he didn't really get to do at home due to lack of money (dad had to have his drinking money!) and opportunity.  With us, he has gotten an opportunity to try everything his heart desires.  He made a select baseball team - which practices multiple times a week, and he started bowling because he would go to grandpa's league night for some guy time.  We got him into a coached kids league and they have been working with him and he's met some great kids from nearby towns that he loves to hangout with.  So if you want to see this boy, you need to get on his calendar early!\n\nDad objects strenuously to these activities.  He refuses to support them by paying money towards them or showing up.  My grandson has gradually started refusing to go to his dad's because he would have to miss bowling or baseball.  Dad is ticked.\n\nNow little sister wants to do dance or gymnastics.  Dad is ready to kill us for even suggesting it.  Baby sister wants to fo these as well.  So what do you do?  Is it fair to tell the kids they have to stop doing things because their father, who threw them out with their mother, is pissed he can't pick them up every weekend?  Then add in that he has told the kids and their mom that the only reason he is demanding to get them every weekend is that he wants to establish that he has them 50% of the time so he doesn't have to pay child support  \n\nDad of the year here.  Geesch.\n\nI went ahead and signed the girls up for a summer dance class.  He FAFO so to hell with him.  I told my daughter I will drain my 401k to pay for a lawyer to take him for everything if he so much as raises a stink about it with the kids.  He uprooted their lives and he doesn't get to spend the next 10 years screwing them up and over so he can play petty games with her.  \n\nSo, OP, you are an ASS.  All you can do is whine about how it affects you.  Did you ever bother to see your son's side?  Did you ever bother to go to a practice or game, and cheering him on?  You know if you did, you might end up with a relationship with him as he gets older.  If you persist, don't be surprised if he goes to a judge as soon as he can and say he doesn't want to visit you any longer.  Then he grows up and goes no contact with you.

Your first concern is your time with him, his injuries seemed to be an after thought. By the time I was his age I'd had a broken leg, broken arm and a long list of cuts, bruises and the occasional head injury...because I was a kid with very little fear of those things. To be fair, I was his age in the 80's, so there weren't as many health and safety rules, but I just look back at it as being part of growing up. And to cut off support because of it is a pretty shitty trick. You're punishing your son for literally enjoying being an active kid.\n\nETA: Consider this. You somehow manage to take away his sports so he can spend more time with you. How do you reckon he's going to feel about you while you're together? Do you think he'll be all \"Yay, more time with dad!\", or do you think he'll be feeling more like \"I could be playing soccer with my mates right now\"?", "YTA. As a divorced dad who gets his kids 5 days on 5 off I\u2019m pretty disgusted you only spend two weekends a month with your son and you cry about your time. You\u2019re a poor excuse for a father.

I can't believe you think that not playing or liking sports yourself is a valid excuse for not spending that time with your son. It sounds like you're just lazy.  Your other excuses are lame as well.

And ask if could you slightly modify the schedule slightly to better distribute those hours.\n\nOf course, the answer is probably no, since your comments have pointed out that you can\u2019t even go to the games to support your son and cheer him on.

He drove, sometimes 4 hours round trip in a day, to watch me compete and spend time with me (overall, he was probably at more shows than my mom), he always loved photography as a hobby, so he got really good at taking pictures of me and my friends riding - to this day (I\u2019m 43 now, lol) I have soooo many pictures he took at shows - and I know he gave up a lot of his custody time so I could be at the barn. \n\nHe wasn\u2019t a perfect parent by any means, and definitely had his flaws, but all these years later, what stands out most is that he showed up, took an interest, got involved, sacrificed a lot so that I could participate and excel in the sport I loved, and used it as a way to bond and spend time with me. \n\nThat\u2019s how a parent should respond to a situation like this, imo. OP, you\u2019re a huge, gaping AH.", "Gosh, I really want to believe this is a spam post and OP really doesn't think he's more important than his son.

You do it for them not for you.  Seriously.

No child of divorce likes spending time at other parent\u2019s house with literally nothing to do. His sports give him a sense of normalcy. When I was young, I was terrified to make plans on the days my dad was supposed to have me. I would have had such an easier time if he supported me doing my own things on the days he didn\u2019t have anything out of the ordinary planned. I spent so much time sitting on his couch having major fomo because of what I knew I was missing (friend\u2019s birthdays, general fun plans, etc). If my dad made plans with me to do fun things I wouldn\u2019t have missed out so much. It sounds like OP\u2019s dad wants all the benefits of being a parent without the work.

I have attended so many soccer games, karate tournaments, gymnastics meetings, bowling games, badminton tournaments and when I couldn't make it to my oldest son's guitar recital before Christmas as my youngest was sick, I made sure grandma was there so that at least he had 1 person in the audience (my husband was out of town for work). \n\nMy youngest REAAAALLLY wants to play tennis, there is no local tennis team/group/meetups so I'm buying gear and gonna learn too. I'm NOT a sports person either, but this is what we do as parents, we support them. \n\nOh and broken bones? Kids do that, heck my youngest fell when he got off the chair at the table and broke his arm on new years eve, we spent the new years in the ER. Shit happens. Bruises? Even my kids don't know where they got 90% of them, they are rough and that's ok.", "I will NEVER understand this. I am childfree by choice and absolutely don't want to have kids ever. One of the very few things I've thought would be great about having kids would be watching them at all of their activities. Whether that was sports, band concerts, dance, school plays, etc. Like, that would be the very BEST parts of being a parent!", "> My dad used to go out of his way every day to collect me at lunch from school and drop me home, then bring me back. It added 2 hours to his work day just to see me for 15 minutes. I came to really appreciate this when I grew up and realised exactly what he was doing. \n\nExactly! Maybe you didn\u2019t know exactly what he was doing when you were a kid, or why, but it meant something, and made you feel loved and special, and most importantly, you remembered it (in a good way). \n\nAnd maybe even more importantly - I\u2019m not a parent, so I can\u2019t say - he modeled what being a good parent is, so that you can be that type of parent you your kids, and create that legacy, if that makes sense.", "They wanted the social status that comes with being a \u201cfamily man\u201d while also relying on their partner to maintain the home and raise the kids. \n\nSo many people are convinced they need to have kids because that\u2019s what adults do.", "Ugh, people. Sorry you had them for parents", "You\u2019re a grade A asshole. I don\u2019t like/never played sports either but if my kid liked them, I\u2019d be there for him every weekend.", "YTA\n\nIt's really shitty for you to try to interfere with your son's interests because you don't share them. \n\nAnd it's your weekend but you're not attending these games? WTF, man.", "This is probably why his mom has full custody", "YTA. I think of you try to take that to a judge he will just ask your son what he wants to do. You son is at the age where he probably does have a say in where he spends his time. My guess is that he will want to play sports rather than stay with you for the weekend.", "What are you even going to the lawyer about? Boys and girls both play sports and it\u2019s actually very healthy for them. \n\nA supportive dad would be at those games watching and cheering for your son. \nA supportive dad would ask to go bowling with his son. \nA supportive dad would tell his son that he\u2019s proud of him for finding something he enjoys that is keeping him active and healthy. \nA supportive dad would nurture his son\u2019s interests and encourage him/ practice with him so that he can get better. \nA supportive dad would workout with his son and watch his form to prevent any incidental injuries that might occur. \n\nInjuries occur in anything and it\u2019s not just sports. I work in an combined urgent care/ physical therapy clinic and we\u2019ve seen all kinds of injuries in kids that don\u2019t play any sports. Kids get injuries from having fun and that\u2019s just a part of being a kid. \n\nAlso, a kid playing a sport is a lot better than a kid glued to an iPad, social media, etc. Childhood obesity is becoming a real problem and often childhood obesity becomes adolescent and then adult obesity. In simple terms the weight you have as a kid is harder to \u201close\u201d once you get older. That\u2019s due to the fact that fat cells don\u2019t disappear they just shrink. \n\nSo while there is a risk of orthopedic injuries there is also an advantage in that he is lowering his risk for metabolic issues.\n\nYTA in case you couldn\u2019t guess.", "Like dude, it\u2019s your job to go to his soccer matches. JFC I go to games of my nephews and nieces just to be a supportive uncle. They\u2019re not even my kids!!! What is wrong with you?", "How many of us as kids played a sport that our parents didn't care about do you think? I doubt my mom or dad wanted to spend every Saturday for a decade getting super involved in the intricacies of elementary school soccer, but they still showed up to watch their chubby gremlin of a son attempt to chase a ball around a field for a few hours. You don't do it for the love of the sport, you do it for the love of the kid, and to see them happy", "OP: Wah wah it's so hard to go to my kid's sports events, learn a new thing, spend some time outside in the fresh air, and talk to other parents. Like Jesus, get a grip dad.\n\nYeah YTA", "Oh, because it interferes with his time... Having kids will do that /s.", "seriously TA.", "I mean OP's ex has full custody for a reason tbh. We're just getting a glimpse here of why that is.", "Absolutely this. Good parenting involves getting excited for what your kid is interested in, even if it bores you to tears. That\u2019s how you develop a bond. \n\nDo you think I enjoy reading the same book over and over or repeating the same phrases during pretend play with my 2yo? It\u2019s boring as shit. But my 2yo fucking loves it and my involvement makes her happy. Her happiness and our bond trumps my boredom.", "I am a father to 4 girls and have been divorced from their mother for 6 years. They have done competitive dance, cheer, volleyball, soccer, basketball, and now softball. I have never missed a practice, a game, or a competition whether it took place when they were with their mom or not. If you want to spend time with your son, go to his practices/games. Those are times you will never be able to get back. Hard YTA.", "Exactly!!!!!", "Goddamnit, take the angry upvote!", "This whole thing seems like it was wrote by a 10 year old so I doubt he even knows how to spell supportive", "This guy has Reddit moment energy. \u201cWhy should my son play the sports ball?!\u201d", "Seriously. I'm a dancer, but my worst injuries are always outside of dance. Sprained an ankle doing laundry. Jammed a finger putting paper in a printer. I'm safer at the studio!", "Bingo, El Ringo!", "i\u2019m not even in sports, never have been, and still broke my ankle after walking on an uneven sidewalk at school", "But like imagine the conversation with the lawyer.\n\nSo sir why are you here?\n\nMy 13yo enjoys sports!\n\n*gasp*", "This is awful.", "I didn't even think twice about it I read it normally too until I saw this next comment lmao", "Yeppers", "Judge is going to invent \"negative custody\" just for OP", "I come from a large family as well and many of us played sports. My dad never took much of an interest and rarely attended any event (he was very much the \"I work all day and earn the money so don't expect me to do much\" type). And if he did attend, he was just kind of a lump. He definitely gave off the vibe that he was only there because he felt obligated to be there. It wasn't any kind of treat to have him there. \n\n My mom, however, was always attending games, picking the kids up from or dropping them off at practice, taking us shopping if we needed to buy something for our sport, picking us up when we'd get back from away games late at night, etc. \n\nHow she managed that, I'll never know, but she was always there and I'm assuming she was in a constant state of exhaustion, but you'd never know it as she would cheer louder than anyone. \n\nI don't think you have to love sports as a parent but your kids will definitely be able to tell when you don't give a shit about the things they enjoy.", "> every god-awful recital \n\nHaha, as I wrote in another reply\u2026 Does anyone actually like the recorder? \n\nBut seriously, I\u2019m not a parent, and even I know that those \u201cgod-awful recitals\u201d are part of what you sign up for when you have kids. Like, they might be objectively awful, but you show up and enjoy them anyway, because that\u2019s *your* kid up there. Right?", "His kid should be sitting at his dad\u2019s place all day on weekends eating stale saltines and watching daytime television, as god intended", "Yeah, because I'm sure that the ex realizes how badly that would likely blow up in OP's face, either taking away his pitiful as it is custody completely, or getting it put in writing that he *has* to take the son to his activities if he wants to keep it.", "I am a little impressed you just kept climbing after the first, second and third fall.", "I love this, and thank you for sharing!", "It sends a big message that he can\u2019t even be bothered to try to share his son\u2019s interests. Or even feign interest in them.", "Me too!", "I know right! Reddit has ruined us.", " Kid bones are both ridiculously tough and stupidly fragile all at the same time. My parents still let me try out for soccer; I got hit in the face 3x and broke my foot by *tripping over air.* I was amazingly clumsy as a kid. I'm now slightly less clumsy adult.", "I don\u2019t think he\u2019s concerned about the kids safety since his only reason for bringing it up is that he\u2019s worried people might think he abuses the kid", "Same.. I was bracing myself to be heartbroken when her dad tore her away from her beloved horses, then the story did a complete 180!", "\"I think the other difference between my dad and OP is that my dad really wanted to be a parent, so seeing me happy and supporting my interests\"- u/jericha your dad was the best, compared to OP being an absolute whining deadbeat.", "lol so impressed that I\u2019m pressed"]}
