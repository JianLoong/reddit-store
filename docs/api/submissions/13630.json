Playing sports is a normal and healthy part of childhood, when the child chooses to play.  Your reasoning for denying your son a rewarding part of his life are a) horrendously selfish and b) flimsy AF.  It\u2019s normal for a kid who plays sports to have injuries appropriate to the sport, and won\u2019t raise the specter of abuse unless you have obviously wrong things like handprint shaped bruises showing up.  I\u2019m very fair skinned and have a genetic disorder that makes me get bruised and cut easily (didn\u2019t get diagnosed until age 25), and I played soccer from about age 7 through adulthood, and rarely had anyone ask about my sports-related injuries.

You are an AH regardless!\n\nMy STBXSIL kicked out my daughter (his wife) and 3 kids so he was free to sleep with the babysitter.  Daughter moved in with us and has been here since.\n\nThe oldest child, LOVES sports - something he didn't really get to do at home due to lack of money (dad had to have his drinking money!) and opportunity.  With us, he has gotten an opportunity to try everything his heart desires.  He made a select baseball team - which practices multiple times a week, and he started bowling because he would go to grandpa's league night for some guy time.  We got him into a coached kids league and they have been working with him and he's met some great kids from nearby towns that he loves to hangout with.  So if you want to see this boy, you need to get on his calendar early!\n\nDad objects strenuously to these activities.  He refuses to support them by paying money towards them or showing up.  My grandson has gradually started refusing to go to his dad's because he would have to miss bowling or baseball.  Dad is ticked.\n\nNow little sister wants to do dance or gymnastics.  Dad is ready to kill us for even suggesting it.  Baby sister wants to fo these as well.  So what do you do?  Is it fair to tell the kids they have to stop doing things because their father, who threw them out with their mother, is pissed he can't pick them up every weekend?  Then add in that he has told the kids and their mom that the only reason he is demanding to get them every weekend is that he wants to establish that he has them 50% of the time so he doesn't have to pay child support  \n\nDad of the year here.  Geesch.\n\nI went ahead and signed the girls up for a summer dance class.  He FAFO so to hell with him.  I told my daughter I will drain my 401k to pay for a lawyer to take him for everything if he so much as raises a stink about it with the kids.  He uprooted their lives and he doesn't get to spend the next 10 years screwing them up and over so he can play petty games with her.  \n\nSo, OP, you are an ASS.  All you can do is whine about how it affects you.  Did you ever bother to see your son's side?  Did you ever bother to go to a practice or game, and cheering him on?  You know if you did, you might end up with a relationship with him as he gets older.  If you persist, don't be surprised if he goes to a judge as soon as he can and say he doesn't want to visit you any longer.  Then he grows up and goes no contact with you.

Your first concern is your time with him, his injuries seemed to be an after thought. By the time I was his age I'd had a broken leg, broken arm and a long list of cuts, bruises and the occasional head injury...because I was a kid with very little fear of those things. To be fair, I was his age in the 80's, so there weren't as many health and safety rules, but I just look back at it as being part of growing up. And to cut off support because of it is a pretty shitty trick. You're punishing your son for literally enjoying being an active kid.\n\nETA: Consider this. You somehow manage to take away his sports so he can spend more time with you. How do you reckon he's going to feel about you while you're together? Do you think he'll be all \"Yay, more time with dad!\", or do you think he'll be feeling more like \"I could be playing soccer with my mates right now\"?", "YTA. As a divorced dad who gets his kids 5 days on 5 off I\u2019m pretty disgusted you only spend two weekends a month with your son and you cry about your time. You\u2019re a poor excuse for a father.

I can't believe you think that not playing or liking sports yourself is a valid excuse for not spending that time with your son. It sounds like you're just lazy.  Your other excuses are lame as well.

And ask if could you slightly modify the schedule slightly to better distribute those hours.\n\nOf course, the answer is probably no, since your comments have pointed out that you can\u2019t even go to the games to support your son and cheer him on.
