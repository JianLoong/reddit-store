The only upsetting thing about this whole post is that you even thought of questioning yourself enough to post it here.\n\nYour siblings and their partners are dipshits, and they're raising the next generation of fuckwits we're all going to have to deal with.\n\nIf those kids have any chance of not growing up to be. Well. What their parents are, it's you teaching them the lessons their parents won't by absolute schlam dunking on them just like this whenever you get the chance.\n\nAnd every time anyone complains you should absolutely tell them all of that.", "NTA. Drunk parents allow kids who can\u2019t swim to run around a pool pushing people in and recording it - and they blame **you**? Frankly, there was every chance they\u2019d have ended up in the water at some point anyway, given what they were doing. I\u2019m glad the kids weren\u2019t hurt (yes, they were behaving badly, but kids will do that and it\u2019s up to the adults in charge of them to deal with it) - and think it\u2019s a very fair consequence that the negligent parents lost their phones.", "Do you really have to ask?\n\nNTA", "NTA - That shit is super dangerous.\n\nThere was a bride awhile back who got pushed into the pool at her reception and became a quadriplegic", "Gee, I wonder why the OP doesn\u2019t like them. They sound absolutely charming. NTA! Those poor teachers.", "NTA. The kids FAFO. IF the parents' phones got ruined in the process, that's on them for not controlling their little hellions. I can see why you avoid family get togethers. Hopefully, next time, your wife won't allow herself to be guilted into making you go.", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA. \n1. Your dad is epic.\n2. I would have done the exact same as you. \n3. Your siblings and their families sound like pure joy. I'm being 5000% sarcastic here and I don't blame you one bit for staying away from them.", "Absolutely not the AH.  Their parents are.  You did not mention the ages of the children but they certainly got a dose of their own medicine.  The parents should have dealt with their children when they pushed the neighbor in the pool.  It sounds like your sisters and bil's are  lousy, lazy parents.  No reasonable person would expect you to let the kids push you in when you were fully clothed.", "\ud83d\udc4f congratulations \ud83c\udf89 I would have done the same thing", "NTA, reminds me of going to an outdoor reception with a pool for daughter\u2019s impending marriage. Father of the groom was drunk and was edging toward me before rushing to knock me in. I grabbed his coat and made it clear it would be both of us or neither of us. Neither won out.  Sober, he apologized.", "NTA. People tried being asses to you. You avoided them.", "LMAO. NTA.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI aspire to be the dad in the whirlpool when I grow up.", "NTA \n\nThey should  e watching their children and the kids should have been punished after knocking the neighbor into the pool. It's the parents and kids fault.", "Go DAD!\n\nNTA\n\nSounds like a nightmare to be honest. What terrible brats - both child- and adult-sized.\n\nAt least you got a margarita before it all went down. Hope they paid insurance for their phones though ;)", "Hahahahahaha", "NTA. Two points:\n\n1) For the kids: if you are going to try to push people in the pool, winding up in the pool yourself is a risk you take. Therefore, if you don't want to get wet, don't try to push people in. This is even more important if you can't swim.\n\n2) For the parents: They are your kids. They are **your** responsibility. It's fine to have fun at a cookout, but if there is an obvious danger nearby, **like a pool**, it is your responsibility not to get so drunk that you can't keep an eye on your own kids should they do something stupid like try to push people into the pool that don't want to get wet.\n\nYou are fine in this situation. There is no reason where you should have to be terrorized by kids just because they are bored.", "NTA.  Crap like this needs to be shut down.", "NTA. Whilst you seem like a bit of a downer, you had every right to step out of the way. They 100% should have been watching their kids. Not your fault in the slightest. Now if you had been pushed in and been pissed that your phone was broken, I bet you would have been the ass then too. And I bet nobody would have fished it out for you, and had you have demanded payment I bet nobody would have offered either. \n\nStand firm.", "NTA \n\nThe parents KNEW their kids could NOT SWIM and took them somewhere with deep water and were not watching THEIR kids.", "NTA. I can definitely see why you didn't want to attend in the first place. Kids sound out of control and the parents are just as bad.", "This should be written into a movie. Great scene!\nNTA.", "NTA. There was a similar post to this the other day . Would the Parents have bought you a new Cell if it had gone it the pool with you? What about if you had gotten injured ? All you did was avoid the kids.\n\nDrunk or not, Parents are ultimately responsible for the safety of their own kids, not you.", "> One of my BILs got into the pool to try to retrieve the phones but his BMI and BAC made that impossible.\n\nlol NTA\n\nthey are lucky the neighbor they pushed didn\u2019t get hurt, those kids sound terrible", "NTA. Good for you and thanks for the laughs!  Maybe they will now control their circus & monkeys. But, I doubt it!  Lol", "NTA\n\nTalk about raising your kids to be disrespectful AHs, and being irresponsible parents. What kind of parent gets shitfaced when their children are playing in, and around a fucking pool? Especially when they know that their kids can't fucking swim!?", "Action, meet consequence.\n\nNTA.", "NTA \n\nAnd your dad is the Zen master of family BBQs", "NTA. Although pro tip bring your swim trunks and cooler and hang out in the whirlpool with Dad.", "Of course NTA", "NTA\u2026I would have done the same thing. Kids have to learn and of they can\u2019t swim they shouldn\u2019t be running around a pool. You are right\u2014their parents should be watching them and also not allowing them to push people in the pool.", "NTA\n\nConsequences for choices? Yep, got \u2018em, right here folks.", "I get selective story telling vibes here....", "OK first you are NTA. Second I love your dad. Third not your kids not your responsibility.", "Nta. They decided to drink instead of being a parent. It\u2019s not your problem. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "NTA. I would dearly love to see the video of that whole incident.", "Obviously NTA. And now maybe you won\u2019t even be invited wouldn\u2019t that be a shame?", "NTA and your dad is a legend", "LMAO and NTA.", "Dad, of course, never got out of the whirlpool.\n\nGoals tbh. NTA on your part anyway.", "You simply got out of the way. \n\nThis sounds like a win for you and your wife. \nToo rowdy, no thanks.", "I like grandad.. Never batted an eye from the comfy spot.. But you sir are nta, you weren't in a suit and swimming so you saved yourself and probably phone, keys and wallet/money..", "NTA.\n\nMaybe those little shits will learn something.", "NTA", "NTA", "Lol. NTA. Guess they learned their lesson. Side note: What irresponsible parents have their kids anywhere near a pool these days when they don\u2019t know how to swim? Swimming is a life skill. Your sisters and BILs are definitely to blame any way you try to look at this situation. 2nd side note: I love your dad \ud83d\ude02", "NTA. Next time follow dad's lead.", "\u201cMy folks decided to host a barbeque because I guess that's what older people do.\u201d This is such a strange way to frame the context of the story that I\u2019m at a loss. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re TA for stepping out of the way; however, there is something about how you are telling the story that makes me really want to hear another perspective from someone present.", "90% of these stories don't even belong on here. For the most part they go like this. \n\nI made 100 steak dinners for a homeless shelter, USDA prime, top of the line. Well little Suzie Q wanted lobster instead of steak. I told her sorry but I don't have any, steak is all I made. So AITA?", "That's probably the one positive thing that will come out of this. Wife is much more tolerant and forgiving than I am towards my siblings but based on what she was saying on the way home I think she's had it with them as well.", "What is FAFO?\n\nEDIT: Thank you everyone. Means Fuck around and find out.", "The kids are fine, by the time I left they were inside watching TV. I think they're 7, 9, 10, 10, and 11. It was the middle three who played kamikaze with me. I'm guessing the 11 year old egged them on, she's usually the ringleader.", "They got away with doing the same wrong thing to the neighbor so they tried a repeat performance. Punish kids the first time, Jesus. How else will they learn?", "And with a cell phone.", "I realize they're just kids and they were just having fun. The fact that they though this was OK is more of a reflection on their parents than them.\n\nJust wish we hadn't gone. It's nice to see my folks and their neighbors but I really, really don't like my sisters or their husbands. They don't hide their envy of us and they're just exhausting to be around.", "Oh yeah he obviously wanted no part of that shit show.", "That man knew exactly where to be based on years of experience.

They have the classic great-for-entertaining house and are always coming up with a reason to get together. They'd wanted everyone to be at their place for the 4th of July but one of my sisters and her family were on a vacation, so this was a \"fake\" 4th of July party complete with flags, red white and blue decorations, barbeque, a margarita machine, etc. Sparklers were promised to the kids.

NtAH.  THE parents are 10000% responsible for the entire mess and karma just sent them a clue.  As a parent if mine had done that, I would have fished them out, tore them a new one and had them apologize.  I would then offer congratulations for dunking them.  They apparently needed a come to Jesus moment and a good old fashioned dunked usually has that effect.  \n\nYour dad sounds like a true dad.  He let it play out and let the girls he raised deal with the consequences because this was a direct result of their crappy choices- both parenting and drinking wise.", "Well, if there's a next time, don't go.", "Clearly a sign of very poor parenting. You did nothing wrong.", "I'm sorry, no, they are not just being kids. This behaviour is absolutely unacceptable and sounds like a parenting failure. \nMy kids and also their friends would never dare pushing anyone into a pool at a party like that, never. This is not normal child's play at all, they are terribly spoilt and badly brought up. Completely unacceptable.", "I think you improved their prank. They should be grateful. Wheres their sense of humour!", "They were toast the moment they were in more than 6ft of water. Even the best IP ratings go to 6ft deep for 30 mins, if the phones were in the deep end they're fried. Bonus for OP, they'll have fun tryna get into their apple IDs without the phone to send a code to for two factor authentication", "Was anyone getting a wide shot at least, on a phone that isn't now toast?", "Honestly that kind of thinking is fucking terrifying to me as a parent. \n\nI used to be a lifeguard when I was younger, there is a reason I don't let anyone take my kids swimming, on a boat, or even camping near a lake or river without me. I've seen waaay too many kids almost drown, because their parents looked away for even a couple of minutes. \n\nHell even being a certified life guard, I almost drowned as a teenager after getting sucked 400 yards out from the shore line by an invisible rip tide. If it hadn't been for a couple of paddle boarders that saw me, I would have drowned, because the under tow kept sucking me back down.", "This clarifies nothing, as none of this detailed extra information has anything to do with \u201cwhat older people do\u201d, and none of it was necessary. \u201dMy parents hosted a barbecue\u201d would have been entirely sufficient context for the story. There seems to be a not-so-subtle antipathy or disdain towards the parents, the sisters, the BILs and the children throughout the post. You\u2019re NTA for stepping out of the way, but I do wonder if you are a person whom most people present would have rather enjoyed seeing pushed into a pool.", "Well, you do understand that for some people, being around (certain) other people can be very exhausting. Yes? Not everyone is an extrovert. And not everyone one knows does one necessarily like."]}
