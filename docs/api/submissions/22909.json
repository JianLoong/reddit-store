Well.

Frankly, there was every chance they\u2019d have ended up in the water at some point anyway, given what they were doing. I\u2019m glad the kids weren\u2019t hurt (yes, they were behaving badly, but kids will do that and it\u2019s up to the adults in charge of them to deal with it) - and think it\u2019s a very fair consequence that the negligent parents lost their phones.", "Do you really have to ask?\n\nNTA", "NTA - That shit is super dangerous.\n\nThere was a bride awhile back who got pushed into the pool at her reception and became a quadriplegic", "Gee, I wonder why the OP doesn\u2019t like them.

You did not mention the ages of the children but they certainly got a dose of their own medicine.  The parents should have dealt with their children when they pushed the neighbor in the pool.

Two points:\n\n1) For the kids: if you are going to try to push people in the pool, winding up in the pool yourself is a risk you take. Therefore, if you don't want to get wet, don't try to push people in. This is even more important if you can't swim.\n\n2) For the parents: They are your kids. They are **your** responsibility. It's fine to have fun at a cookout, but if there is an obvious danger nearby, **like a pool**, it is your responsibility not to get so drunk that you can't keep an eye on your own kids should they do something stupid like try to push people into the pool that don't want to get wet.\n\nYou are fine in this situation. There is no reason where you should have to be terrorized by kids just because they are bored.", "NTA.  Crap like this needs to be shut down.", "NTA. Whilst you seem like a bit of a downer, you had every right to step out of the way. They 100% should have been watching their kids. Not your fault in the slightest.

That\u2019s just bad parenting", "Pools, kids and drunk parents are not only a toxic mess but life altering (or ending).  Who the hell gets hammered while their kids are running around pools and can\u2019t swim?!  Also why don\u2019t those kids know how to swim when their family clearly has a pool?  That\u2019s negligent on multiple fronts.  My MIL had a pool, my son started swim lessons and getting safe around water before he could walk and was a fully safe and a good, strong swimmer by 4, private lessons are way better than group lessons in my opinion especially with young kids, and before that he was never allowed near the pool without a life jacket or another float type suit (not water wings)", "I have to admit, this was my favorite part of the story.", "80's movie dad vibes", "I was thinking the same.", "Yup.

They didn't spank us often, only when we did something REALLY bad.", "Typical lazy, entitled parents. \"Why should we watch our kids? We're saints for creating them! Worship us! Serve us!

His hair also grew in gray where his head hit the pool although there was no skin breakage, no blood. I felt horrible then and still feel bad. His parents were very nice about it, he was, too. It was the only time I wasn\u2019t careful around the water and lived to regret it.", "I can see why they're envious, but they all CHOSE to procreate. I don't believe anyone forced them, and having kids is absolutely not mandatory.", "Totally beside the point, but children that age should fully be able to swim. Or at least know how to not drown?", "Also, all of those kids are old enough that they should know how to swim. That is also very irresponsible and dangerous for childen to not know how to swim at that age.", "7-11 year olds should be able to swim well enough to get to the side of a pool. Their parents are completely irresponsible for not teaching them swim basics when they have access to a pool.", "I was at my bros house he had friends over. They were drinking. One of the kids started drowning because it went into the deep end. I pulled the kid out and gave its mother a stern talking to about how her kid needs a life jacket if it wants to swim and her reaction, \"but none of the other kids are wearing a life jacket\" well those kids can all swim you dumb fuck. I told her to comply or no swimming at all. My bro said I over reacted and let the kid go if it stayed in the shallow.\n\nHe then pulled the kid out because the kid had started drowning a second time.\n\nThey still did not get pool privileges revoked.", "Maybe so, but the first person they terrorized wasn\u2019t a family member but a neighbor.", ">two of the kids had been videoing the trick using their parents' iPhones, which were now at the bottom of the pool.\n\nThat part was the icing on the cake, for me..!  LOL.\n\nServes them right!\n\nNTA.", "IF you were in a swimsuit and IF they were quite a bit younger and you saw them coming, it might've been the cool thing to do to let them getcha.

They have no authority and by the same token no responsibility.", "Im guessing he didn\u2019t even want to have a pool party in the first place and it was planned unilaterally \nNTA op this was an epic read", "I remember another thread about drowning on Reddit, and someone posted a link to this series of \"Spot the Drowning Child\" videos on YouTube.\n\nIt's crazy.

I\u2019m a paramedic and it is never my circus, never my monkeys. Unless it\u2019s the patient\u2026then sadly, it is my circus and the monkey is usually very very drunk.", "Right?! The biggest assholes in this story are the parents for 1) not ensuring their kids know how to swim; 2) letting said kids hang out by a pool; and 3) getting drunk and assuming others will supervise them. \n\nThey're real lucky that the other guests fished their kids out of the pool. As a soon-to-be parent, I can't imagine getting drunk and just assuming someone else will look out for my kid.", "Heck even if they could swim the parents getting that drunk is irresponsible at the best of times around children nevermind when a real danger like a pool is around as could slip while running around it or other things as even people who are solid swimmers can still drown in pools.\n\nEven an olympic level swimmer has had to be rescued from drowning before.", "\"Trying to get to the bottom is basically resistance training!\" - what I tell myself when I'm at the pool", "Tell me he\u2019s fat and drunk without saying he\u2019s fat and drunk \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "OP's Dad probably didn't even have a say in the matter either, so I agree with ya 100%.", "If you\u2019ve married someone who doesn\u2019t allow you any day in raising your own family, then you made a big fucking mistake.

It didn't matter how many good memories I had with him...They're always overshadowed by the bad drunk memories.\n\nOn the flip, my husband never even saw his dad drink.\nMy husband has overdone it on a couple of occasions...we're talking falling out of the car puking in front of our kids. I lost my shit. Absolutely lost my shit. He got it wasn't cool but didn't get why it was such a huge deal. I said because your 10 year old daughter is 100% going to remember that moment for the rest of her life. Get your shit together or we will no longer be attending anything where you have the opportunity to get drunk.", "And even if they *were* all capable of swimming, from the sound of things these little hellions were pushing people into the *shallow end*, where it would be *very* easy for them to get concussed and be in need of rescue.", "Excellent point!

They pushed an adult in the pool.", "Definitely not normal behavior for kids especially if they\u2019re pushing elderly and people in street clothes into the pool, probably to post on TikTok.

Even then, just bc someone is a bad person doesn\u2019t mean their parents failed them. There\u2019s plenty of examples of loving parents who have kids that grow to be heinous criminals. Doesn\u2019t mean the parenting was bad.", "Yeah we are big on water safety and I have very little tolerance for people who are flippant about it. Yes, let's have fun in the water, but in order to have fun we need a designated, sober person who's keeping an eye on the children.

It\u2019s not fun, nor pain-free", "I\u2019m sorry, but no. As a parent of two young children, it\u2019s my job to enforce discipline. At my parents or in-laws house, they can set the standard for acceptable behavior, it\u2019s my job to make sure my kids follow it. At least one of us between my wife and I is also going to be sober at these get together, doubly so if there is a pool.", "Seeing as it was the Mom who pressured OPs wife to come, there was probably a side conversation of \"okay, we can have the barbecue, but I'm not dealing with the kids this time while their parents are drinking...because that always happens\" or something along those lines.", "If the Dad  was sitting alone in the wirlpool drinking during the party it was not his idea .. I\u2019m sure his wife convinced him to do it.", "As a dad, probably in his general age range, I figure it was the grandmother's idea for the pool party and he objected but allowed it to happen.

He took the right approach and let her choices lead to the natural consequences.", "Who said they were cohosts?

My dad talking sense while my mom just wanted to make a moment so bad she could never see the impending disaster that was so blatantly clear to everyone else. My dad passed in October, now my mom is just a runaway train. My sisters and I finally realized just how much he actually did rein her in.. My dad didn\u2019t have a whirlpool, but he had his chair. And he took great joy in sitting there and tripping the kids as they ran screaming through the house. Never took his eyes of the tv. Like a damn ninja that size 14 EEE foot would shoot out so fast at the last second they never even figured out it was him. I used to watch him awe", "This is exactly what I was thinking, mostly because my mom is that grandma lol.", "This guy barbecues.", "Your suggestion is everyone must be a hermit or an AH like dad. Imagine taking a cooler of beer off to one side for yourself at your party lol", "AMEN!", "Absolutely agree. We have a pool and often have kids and grandies over. Our golden rule is NO ONE is allowed to run around the pool, and NO ONE is allowed to push anyone in....EVER, or they are banned.", "Not only that but those same things could have happened to one of the kids, or multiple of them!! Running and slips before getting to the person? Like good grief this was a mess!!", "My cousins phone fell off a pier into the ocean, they figured it was toast, it washed up on shore, someone found it and was able to call her brother, got it back and it was fine.  My husband also found a phone while snorkeling; no idea how long it had been sitting there but was able to fish it out and it worked fine.", "My family is overall very close and we all get along well in general. However, I think it's a Grandma thing. My mom will do whatever it takes to \"make everyone happy\" when in reality, nobody ends up happy.\n\nLike I said, not a real issue in my family, but I think it's a pretty universal feeling.", "She could have seriously been hurt! Then what?", "That's so weird to me you should be able to have infinite amounts of alcohol at a party it's up to the adults to police themselves and if their parents then one parent at minimum if not one parent for each set of kids or whatever should be staying sober...", "So admittedly I\u2019m not the best judge of normal adult parent child relationships, my parents have been completely hands off with me since I was 16 (not a positive thing and I lived alone for 2 years finishing high school), so I wouldn\u2019t expect my parents to do or say anything, but I also regulate my own behavior because I\u2019m an adult and I don\u2019t think adults with children of their own should need to be told how to act by their parents.", "Lol my wife dropped her phone in the ocean when we were getting in a boat. When we tried to get it replaced, there was some extra payment necessary to use insurance because we didn\u2019t have the old one. \n\nWe spent the better part of the day on the docks with progressively long fishing nets, diving to the bottom, etc. but that phone was Lost.\n\nI\u2019m imagining someone finding it in a crab trap and it being fine after the year+ lol.", "That struck a chord with me, too. My grandma had a pool when I was young, and the most stressed rules were no running, no pushing people in (they could hit their head or something), no jumping in the shallow end, and no going in the deep end without floated until you learned to swim. An aunt made sure we could all swim by 4.\n\nIt\u2019s insane having a pool without enforcing the most basic and common sense rules, at least when young kids are present.", "No the phone in the lake"]}
