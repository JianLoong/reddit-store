The only upsetting thing about this whole post is that you even thought of questioning yourself enough to post it here.\n\nYour siblings and their partners are dipshits, and they're raising the next generation of fuckwits we're all going to have to deal with.\n\nIf those kids have any chance of not growing up to be. Well. What their parents are, it's you teaching them the lessons their parents won't by absolute schlam dunking on them just like this whenever you get the chance.\n\nAnd every time anyone complains you should absolutely tell them all of that.", "NTA. Drunk parents allow kids who can\u2019t swim to run around a pool pushing people in and recording it - and they blame **you**? Frankly, there was every chance they\u2019d have ended up in the water at some point anyway, given what they were doing. I\u2019m glad the kids weren\u2019t hurt (yes, they were behaving badly, but kids will do that and it\u2019s up to the adults in charge of them to deal with it) - and think it\u2019s a very fair consequence that the negligent parents lost their phones.", "Do you really have to ask?\n\nNTA", "NTA - That shit is super dangerous.\n\nThere was a bride awhile back who got pushed into the pool at her reception and became a quadriplegic", "Gee, I wonder why the OP doesn\u2019t like them.

You did not mention the ages of the children but they certainly got a dose of their own medicine.  The parents should have dealt with their children when they pushed the neighbor in the pool.

Two points:\n\n1) For the kids: if you are going to try to push people in the pool, winding up in the pool yourself is a risk you take. Therefore, if you don't want to get wet, don't try to push people in. This is even more important if you can't swim.\n\n2) For the parents: They are your kids. They are **your** responsibility. It's fine to have fun at a cookout, but if there is an obvious danger nearby, **like a pool**, it is your responsibility not to get so drunk that you can't keep an eye on your own kids should they do something stupid like try to push people into the pool that don't want to get wet.\n\nYou are fine in this situation. There is no reason where you should have to be terrorized by kids just because they are bored.", "NTA.  Crap like this needs to be shut down.", "NTA. Whilst you seem like a bit of a downer, you had every right to step out of the way. They 100% should have been watching their kids. Not your fault in the slightest.
