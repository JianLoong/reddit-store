So I\u2019m curious", "NTA sleep is essential for health and function, daily and over time. Whether you work or not, and you do, it is so inconsiderate and juvenile (in the scenario you shared). I am pissed off on your behalf. I sleep heavily and if someone wakes me up it better be to call 911. If my dog wakes me up, it never bothers me, because she relies on me and adults are self sufficient. Is he drinking or using substances? You deserve uninterrupted sleep and this is an explicitly disrespectful behaviour. I suggest you tell him he better have money for a hotel to sleep in until he gets his suit together. I am not joking. For your health! And mostly out of respect. He can\u2019t stop? Fuck that guy, there are plenty out there.", "NTA\n\nHe's putting his desire to talk above your need to sleep.    When you're trying to sleep the last thing you want is for someone to chat to you.", "NTA, he is. He wakes you up so he can talk? He wakes you up so he can whine? How old is this man?

If he wanted to polite then maybe he should let you get enough rest to be reasonable. I personally think that the guest room is a great place for him.

And for this to complain about the dogs, that like you said, doesn\u2019t affect you at all.\n\nHe is definitely TA now, and he needs to learn to be quiet when he goes to bed. Or start sleeping in another room.", "NTA, sleep is important and respecting someone\u2019s sleep definitely not something to be cavalier with.

If it\u2019s truly a medical emergency he will keep trying over and over and you\u2019ll get the hint. \n\nYou should have waited until the morning to talk about what had happened that night instead of going off on him. Being confrontational can sometimes blur the point we want to get across, as the other person can get super defensive. In the morning or when things have cooled off you can talk about your experience and how and why it bugged you. After that you two could then work on a compromise. \n\nAlso from one light sleeper to another, I totally recommend a fan or a white noise machine if it\u2019s a constant issue between you two.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

His want to talk things through at any hour of his preference does not trump your biological need for sleep. \n\nThis is a very reasonable boundary that you need to set consistently.

But as a person that have sometimes problems with getting in touch with my own feelings and moreso with talking about them I feel like I would have done something similar, when I would start to feel a bit lonely and crave some more contact.

He loves to talk and share. We talk at least an hour every evening, after I finish work, he comes back from gym, before I eat and go to bed. I show him all the photos and videos I took of the dogs, or things happened at work. More on my days off. A lot of time the things that he tells me at night are repeatation - expansion of what we already spoke. Or something he remembers / happens  after I already go to sleep. It can be as random as he was hungry so he ate more, or a dream he had last night that he just remembered, or even how high the dog jumped trying to take the balloon off his hand.. Like literally random stuff. Things that, in my opinion, are not urgent to share at 3 am while the other person is trying to sleep.", "Thanks.
