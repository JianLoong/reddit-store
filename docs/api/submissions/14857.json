Its incredibly frustrating that they cannot organise themselves properly or be on time.\n\nLike them your mum is just being rude and not thinking of other people.  Sounds like she is a bit of a narcissist if she is complaining about other peoples unhappiness on her forgetfulness but doesn't acknowledge its her fault.  Unfortunately your dad is just enabling it so she won't change because she doesn't have to suffer any consequences of her insensitivity.  \n\nIf I were you I would talk to your dad about it and team up to see what can be done to either alter her behaviour or accommodate the way she is.  If your dad won't help or doesn't see it as a problem then you probably won't be able to do anything about it because he will keep enabling her.", "See, I believe things happen in life where you forget stuff and it's normal. But you said it's a constant back and forth with such and that can be frustrating.\n\nI can't imagine ever driving an hour back because I forgot something. What could be so important?\n\nHonestly, I'd be a bit annoyed too and it's valid to feel a bit annoyed.

At first I was going to suggest perhaps your mother has developed memory issues or a health problem, but then I saw you say she\u2019s been like this your whole life. Chronically late and disorganized people are the worst kind of disrespectful, and I\u2019d be pissed, too. \n\nMy two questions are: \n\n1) why didn\u2019t you tell her an extra early time this time, as you have in the past, so there would be hope of her being ready on time?\n\n2) in the future, is there any chance you and your dad can take some of these trips alone, since you said your mom has been to the destination before and it sounds like both you and dad be much happier leaving mom at home?

You're an adult.  Why are you still holidaying with your parents if you know this is how it's going to go.
