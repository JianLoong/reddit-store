When I\u2019m not involved with the trip, she can do what she wants, but if I\u2019m involved, especially if we\u2019re leaving early and/or have to be somewhere at a specific time, you best believe I\u2019m making moves ahead of time. I ask if she\u2019s already packed, if she needs to do laundry, if everything fits. If she\u2019s not, I ask what she\u2019s taking and start gathering. And then I run through the trip with her (which is standard for me for even trips by myself): \u201cwake up\u2014you\u2019re in pjs. Are those packed? You\u2019re walking around the place\u2014do you need slippers/house socks? You go to the bathroom\u2014do you have your toothbrush? Special soaps/lotions?\u2026\u201d and we go through the whole trip that way, in as broad strokes as we can. \n\nI make it a point to try not to nag, to make it just nice time when I\u2019m hanging out with my mom helping her pack, not me nagging the hell out of her or snapping at her for an hour. At this point, she accepts the help, having demonstrated many times that she\u2019s not always great with this, but in the beginning, if she\u2019d get annoyed, I\u2019d say \u201cbetter we annoy each other a little now, than have an avoidable emergencies and running around tomorrow.\u201d It was a little annoying, but I remembered the times when I was a kid and she had to help me get ready for things. And I\u2019d really much rather possibly be annoyed/annoying for a little bit before the trip starts than have to deal with chaos when there\u2019s no time to fix the problem.", "NTA", "Nta. My mom is also chronically late, and I've gotten to a point where I make my displeasure with it very well known.
