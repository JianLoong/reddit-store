I got all the names in the book from everyone. I even had a boy break up with me because I went to school for a month without wearing glasses and then I came back after fall break wearing glasses and he told me that he didn\u2019t want to be seen dating an ugly four eyed nerd. It was also back when I had no say of what kind of glasses I wore. They only gave me the small oval or square metal framed, which I absolutely hated because it made my vision worse than it already is. I don\u2019t have eye insurance so I had to pay for three exams and my glasses myself, and it costed me about $450 USD or \u00a3396.95 where you live. I recently had to get a new pair for driving reasons. I got the only pair in the store that was both metal and plastic and they\u2019re bigger so I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m only looking at frames. Also, my glasses are clear so I don\u2019t really see them at all anymore. With my new glasses that I\u2019ve had for about three years now, I actually enjoy being out in public because I\u2019m not afraid that people will make fun of me. I get lots of compliments now with them. (My boyfriend really likes them too)\nI really really really hope that things get better with you, from the sounds of it your mom is not going to change how she thinks until you are out of her house, and you no longer speak to her. \nI wish you the best and I hope you get your glasses soon\ud83d\udda4", "Haven\u2019t gotten my glasses back yet, turned out she broke them and I need to get new ones now \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\n\nI\u2019m staying at my friends place for a bit until everything is calmed down, my mother has come over to try and \u2018talk\u2019 to me but my friend helps me to get her out of the house she invited herself into", "Or the mother is manipulating other people to believe only her side of the story", "Thank you so much and I\u2019m so sorry about everything you went through \ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95", "Can you call the police? She\u2019s not a fit parent and your brother needs to escape too since you\u2018re both legal adults.", "Of course doll! And I appreciate it! \ud83e\ude77\ud83d\udda4\ud83e\ude77\ud83d\udda4Honestly most of that stuff happened between 2005-2015 so it\u2019s been awhile since something like that has been said. I\u2019ve come to terms with my right eye being 20/20 and my left eye (lazy eye) being 20/65 for the rest of my life. I hope they continue making these glasses bc these are the only ones I want.", "Already have placed restraining order, me and my friend are wondering what to do next as she is helping me"]}
