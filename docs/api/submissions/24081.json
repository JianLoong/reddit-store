We have an autistic son that proved \u201cchallenging\u201d in many ways. I need not go into what challenging means but at 17 we worked with social services and Derek  moved to a group facility. A really nice facility in the country (Derek lives the outdoors) \n\nThat was years ago. He is now 57 has his own apartment and has planned activities daily. Some with staff and some with other \u201cresidents\u201d.  \n\nWe see Derek often and he comes to our house a few times a month. He calls my wife daily (2:30pm exactly) as well as his brothers, sisters, in laws, etc. \n\nWe could never have supported Derek at home. The cost was not the issue - the emotional support /demands were never-ending. \n\nThe nice thing is the benefit given to our entire family, beyond Derek. Basically everyone has learned to be extremely tolerant and the whole family enjoys being together. \n\nNext week my wife is flying Derek to see his sister (Oregon) and other brothers (in LA) are flying up to join. \n\nSo- yes it\u2019s tough. But there are resources. And we have learned that through the thick and thin of life - Derek is the happiest. Happy every day\u2026. Well, most days. \n\nSo these are at least some options to share.

You can only meet the needs of one of them. It is what it is.\n\nTo me it's about accepting what you can and are ready to do. You've already made a decision about the older sister - she's not moving in with you. Accept it. Then you have to decide on the younger one. If you know you can take in Rosie, but don't, I think that is what you need to work out. At aged 2 she's still highly adoptable so get counselling and decide if you want Rosie or focus on having your own kids only.\n\nThis is a hard decision and you are a good person for trying to sort out what's best for you and the kids. It's ok if you take in one or none. And I am sorry for your loss.", "Very gentle YTA. They lost their parents, now they lose each other?

This sucks.", "I don\u2019t think there is a right answer here - you just have to do the best you can do.  Did you ask the social worker if there was a way to get support services for Lily from the state?  Sometimes when you\u2019re adopting a kid, that\u2019s an option.  Ideally, the government likes to keep families together when they can, so some states have provisions for providing support to disabled kids who are being adopted, even if they wouldn\u2019t qualify for them in their natal family.\n\nAs it\u2019s unlikely for the girls to be placed together, I think I would choose to keep Rosie, in your shoes.

It\u2019s quite probable that they wouldn\u2019t be kept together, especially considering lily\u2019s needs. It\u2019s not my decision, but I think you should keep Rosie with you (her older sister), rather than risk them both going separately into care.\n\nLater in life, you will tell Rosie that you couldn\u2019t afford Lily\u2019s level of care. You couldn\u2019t give her the level she needed, and that you could only afford to keep Rosie at the time and meet her needs. You tell her that in an ideal situation you could have financially afforded both, and that ideally you\u2019d have not needed to work and taken care of Lily. But that it just wasn\u2019t possible.

I'm so sorry for your losses and pain of the decision you are having to make.\n\nI was all set to judge you. Bc I am a parent of an 11f with Down Syndrome.  I also have a 16m. I am also poor, disabled myself and divorced from their deadbeat dad. And I love my daughter very much.  I wouldn't change her in anyway bc she has taught me so much about love, patience, acceptance. BUT. \n\nBut I made myself think about the fact that my daughter is fortunate in that she has minimal health issues. She is abt 5 yrs behind developmentally in school. (6th grade but on kindergarten or 1st level). She has major speech issues.  She's mentally on par with a 6 or 7 yr old. Sometimes she's a normal 11 yr old too. It's unpredictable. \n\nI recently had to deal with her having her first period.  How do you even explain that to a 6 yr old? It was a day I had been dreading for yrs. She came through like a trooper,  took everything in stride as is her way and I needn't have worried so much. But this is just 1 small struggle I face. I can't afford special therapies beyond what school provides. I have made peace that she will be with me forever. And if she had more medical issues? Which is more common with down syndrome? I dont know. I don't know what that would have looked like. \n\nSo I cannot judge you on this bc I didn't have a choice but I don't think I would have chosen this path if I had the choice.  It is hard, and lonely, and frustrating.  For all the good there is bad.

Honestly the best thing you could do is adopt Rose and try to maintain a relationship with her sister. You are a lot more likely to do that than another couple who is not related to her. Absolutely NTA for not taking on more than you can handle. Further down the line you may well feel like you can handle it and there's a good chance Rose would still be available if that happens.", "NTA.

Clearly, you and your husband have thought deeply about the situation, and social services have encouraged this solution. No one is blaming you. You don't feel equipped to care for a child with special needs, and it's absolutely okay not to take on that responsibility. You're providing Rosie with the chance to be in a family connected by blood, where she can get to know her father through you.\r  \n\r  \nPerhaps there are ways to maintain a connection with Lily without taking on full responsibility for her?", "NTA.

Adopting a child you don\u2019t think you\u2019ll be able to give that is just sound.

Still you\u2019ll know the truth. \n\nI don\u2019t know the future. \nBut the truth is everywhere. You can go look at any  nine year old her age with Down syndrome in the system and see for yourself if you\u2019d like. \nShe will certainly not go live out her life on some happy far away farm, with more than everything she could ask for, nor will she have it ended with the shotgun, why should you delude yourself with this fantasy, it\u2019s not true for dogs and won\u2019t be for your sister. what\u2019s coming instead will be merciless. \n\nThis story has a sad ending. \nThe other one will of course know why she was spared. Lily  will grow up and understand that she was a mistake and was not wanted. And no matter how good of a job you do with Rosie, every time you look her in the face and say you love *her no matter what*- she\u2019ll know you\u2019re lying too, long before you ever dare say the truth you yourself. \n\nHad she had Down syndrome\u2026well, let\u2019s not talk about that.

But what\u2019s coming next is almost certainly going to suck- if you can\u2019t take on that responsibility that\u2019s absolutely fine.

In my family, it was me my brother, my sister, my other brother and then my two cousins. Broken families rarely just crack on one fault line. And to this day I ask myself what made me different. What made my sister different, compared to my cousins- and it is this: we accepted our position early on. My cousins on the other hand they\u2019re in their 30s, and they member stopped hoping\u2026and now they\u2019re  broken- and I dare say still, deep down inside, hoping for someone to come along and save them. Those of us who made it out okay saved ourselves. Lily will have to do the same. \n\nI suppose that\u2019s why I\u2019m telling you- to not lie to Lily. At all. The truth is the least you can do. Be strong enough to at least be honest. The truth will hurt you. But the lie will always hurt Lily more. And Rosie will question your love. Regardless. She will never trust your love if you choose instead  to lie to her about this choice. You\u2019ll see that no matter how much the truth can hurt, one will eventually become accustomed to it and one can also become accustomed to running away from it.

It's best for the older child to be in a place where she's getting better care for her, It's better for you guys to not be financially crippled and quite frankly exhausted and mentally pushed to the limits caring for her, and it's best for the youngest child to have parents that aren't in a situation where they're financially and emotionally drained.", "This whole post is gross and stinks of the kind of softball ableism that lets people justify why they feel disabled children are \u201cjust too much\u201d for them to handle.

And continuing to foster a sibling relationship between the girls, even if you are not raising Lily, is incredibly important.", "NTA.  There is a reason that checking if down syndrome is possible during pregnancy.  Everyone isn\u2019t suited to deal with that responsibility.  That decision to birth and care for a special needs child was your father\u2019s and step mom\u2019s.  It\u2019s 100% not your responsibility.  I can\u2019t imagine growing up in foster care.

Living in a country where English isn\u2019t the most commonly spoken language and teaching any nine year old how to be understood and understand what\u2019s being said to them is a big ask\u2014 asking a child with learning difficulties to do the same might be even more challenging and could lead to her being isolated by her peers.", "There\u2019s no simple answer here.

Obvs Rosie is v young but the bond will be strong both ways because they only know each other right now. So for me instead of considering hypothetical in 15 years questions, you need to be comfortable with leaving Lily alone now, as you live abroad so continued contact will be a challenge.

This is a very complex situation and whatever OPs reasons are for not being capable of caring for a child with special needs that is not hers, she is NTA.", "Hey, you adopt that kid if you want. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2642\ufe0f Instead you are here criticizing, tryna make people feel bad. Wow. What a net positive. \n\nOP helping out one is better than none. \n\nYou're not a good person with making a comment like that dude lmao, you're just a critic when you offer no viable alternatives.", "Yeah, of course. We\u2019ve discussed it at length and we\u2019re both willing to do counselling to help with the transition. For me, I don\u2019t care if Rosie came out of me or not, if she\u2019s my kid she\u2019s my kid, and I believe my husband feels the same way. But of course things like that are never linear and we\u2019d work on it. \n\nIf we adopt Rosie, we likely won\u2019t be having any more kids, so for us she\u2019ll never be any less than our daughter.", "I think your response is manipulative due to your own trauma, dude. Not one thing you said was helpful. You just spewed your own anger into this situation. What you could have answered to help guide the decision was if either of your adopted/fostered special needs siblings stayed tg. \n\nThese are such huge decisions and you can see its weighing on her grately. She has already stated that Lily will most likely never be out of state care and that her disabilities are not financially feesable to them. \n\nThey do not have the capabilities to take on a disabled child. They did not birth her, and thats the unfurtante truth. Lily isn't any less loved. I dont think you should take a special needs child to a country where healthcare might be less than adequate to where they already are\n\nNow, onto Rosie, she is 2 they have the financial means to adopt her and keep her  in touch with Lily and OPs family.\n\nTake your trauma out and look at the facts if she leaves rosie, rosie, and Lily will most likely never see each other again. Nor will they have a relationship with their biological family.\n\nOP, im so sorry. You are going through this. You are NTA. It sounds like you already know the right decision, and with time and the help of child therapists explaining age appropriate ideology to help understand as they age, it will be okay. You're not abonding Lily. I know that you won't be able to check in as often, but make sure you still face time call and visit often.\n\nI dont think you should take a special needs child to a country where health care  might be less than adequate to where they already are.", "OP is living in a country where they aren't a citizen and an adopted Lily won't have the same free healthcare a citizen of the country would.  The healthcare costs alone associated with downs syndrome make this very different to an extra mouth to feed.", "Obviously every kid is different, every kid has needs. Rosie might despise air travel to the point we can\u2019t get her in an airport, and we would have to deal with that. Kids are unpredictable, I know that. I just think, I can only make decisions with the information I\u2019ve got. If I tried to anticipate every eventuality I wouldn\u2019t leave the house. This is the information I\u2019ve got today. \n\nIf three years down the line things turn out to be different then that is what it is. I just feel like I have to make the best choices of the ones I\u2019ve got today.", "Yeah sorry! that\u2019s been happening lately. I\u2019ll delete it \u02d9\u25e0\u02d9", "Is there anything like Social Security Survivor Benefits in the UK?  In the US, they would receive benefits until the age of 18 if a parent(s) died.  Adoption might disqualify them for that, I don't know.  Would Lily qualify for any benefits in your country?", "And your country of residence doesn't make funds available to reaise a child with down syndrome?", "It depends but this is not categorically true", "They did. When my uncle lost custody of my cousins. We took them in and my parents were given money. That was about 12 years ago. It might have changed now", "Yes, you get a stipend and food assistance. The foster agencies want to keep the kids with family when possible. Had to foster 5 at once, so that was a big help.", "100% I agree. But anyone can become disabled at any point is what I'm saying. The sister that is able bodied, can easily become unable. People need to recognize that as well. If that were to happen, would she dump rosie' as well? If you cant take care of the disabled child, dont care for either. Find someone who can and who will keep them together.", "I don\u2019t think you understand how important it is to have the proper care for someone with DS. If they know that can\u2019t give her the proper care then why would they adopt her? That could lead to her suffering more so either way she will still suffer. She needs to be put with people who can properly and safely take care of her.", "You seem to be so invested, perhaps you could foster Lily then. Especially since you too have children! You have the same amount of responsibility to her as OP does.", "I want to be clear I think you are NTA. You aren\u2019t obligated to adopt either of them and anyone who isn\u2019t stepping up to adopt a disabled child, can just sit right down. Some people are acting like you are giving up your disabled child. You are not. It\u2019s frankly amazing you are willing to adopt either of them. You are under no obligation, moral or otherwise, to take in your father\u2019s children who he apparently did not adequately plan for. \n\nThat being said Rosie may grow up to have very complex and potentially bitter feelings about you not adopting her sister. Rosie is going to be your daughter. And so Lily is now your daughter\u2019s sister that is being left behind. I\u2019m not saying this is your fault. It\u2019s not. But Rosie may end up resenting you for whatever happens to her sister. \n\nOr she may not. She\u2019s young. What I\u2019m saying is this is extremely fraught. And make sure you\u2019re walking in with your eyes wide open.", "Apologies. I took the way you phrased your travel lifestyle as a choice & leisure not that it was necessary for your jobs. Are there no other jobs that both of you can take with your skill sets that will have less travel with comparable pay? There may not be, but has it been considered?", "Adding on that ive worked in a facility with people who have Down\u2019s syndrome and it is almost certain that at some point they will have to put lily in a group home. It isnt fair for anyone here in the comments to tell OP to adopt her without knowing the full scope of what care entails. We had two live in, full time assistants caring for 2 people with down\u2019s syndrome and 2 with extreme epilepsy. One assistant would take the night shift as sleep walking out of the house or sneaking out of the house was such a common occurrence. This would be asking OP or the husband to leave their job of be in a constant state of exhaustion to do. If the circumstances were different and one was planning to be a stay at home spouse, then sure its  mildly possible since Lily is still young. But those arent her circumstances and if she wants to have a child of her own in the future its unfair even to a stay at home spouse to care for 3 children full time all at once. \n\nGroup homes may be something OP should look into in her country and see if there are any state funded options regardless of citizenship. This way they can all be in the same country. Or if its possible to bring Lily with the intention of putting her in the foster system in their country (unlikely, but still worth getting an answer to)", "I took the way OP phrased lifestyle & travel as a choice & for leisure. That is something that can be changed to save a child from a lifetime of abuse because that\u2019s what\u2019s most likely going to happen to Lily. With OPs response, I now understand that the travel is necessary for their jobs & my apologies for the wrong assumption. That\u2019s very different & may not be able to be changed depending on their skill set.", "Good, I\u2019ve seen a lot of neglected adopted kids growing up once the Naturals arrived. Just wanted to make sure you took that into consideration.", "Lilly is absolutely less loved. Multiple people have mentioned to OP the possibility of advocating for Lilly even if they can\u2019t adopt her and OP hasn\u2019t said anything about advocating for Lilly or anything like that. \n\nBut as someone raising a disabled child, I can\u2019t imagine anyone could do this without resentment and possibly abuse if they didn\u2019t love the child. \n\nSo since OP isn\u2019t willing to help Lilly in any way she definitely shouldn\u2019t adopt her because then she could potentially become the abuser to Lilly.", "Yeah she only cares about how she would live consciously with the decision of Rosie, not the decision of Lily. She also only mentions in her post the life her dad would of wanted for Rosie, but mentions nothing of the life he would of also wanted for Lily. \n\nShe\u2019s not adopting Lily because she has Down syndrome, correct.", "I was very sympathetic to you until you started preplanning all the reasons Rosie can\u2019t see Lily. I can\u2019t help but think you want to wash your hands of Lily and live your life as if she never existed.", "Healthcare is not free here if you aren\u2019t a citizen, and we aren\u2019t. Nor would lily be.", "I get your feelings. I would have been devastated to ever be separated from my siblings. But this mindset just seems so callous and unfair to Rosie. Like she needs to be condemned by her sisters disability that she has zero control of or understanding the situation.", "You're asking OP to locate foster parents? How?", "I understand that. I said this in another comment but at least if she ends up hating us, she\u2019ll have had years of a stable, loving home, and a good education and access to mental health support. She\u2019ll be able to hate us or cut us off with a cushion of having somewhere to go, of a good start in life. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the right thing to not give her all of that just because someday we might have to have a difficult conversation for *me*. Not that I\u2019d ever be looking forward to it, mind you, but at least we could tell her we did the most we were able to.", "Even if it wasn\u2019t for their jobs, it\u2019s not her responsibility to take on something she doesn\u2019t feel prepared to do, and whatever happens to the child beyond that is not OPs fault.", "Have you considered that if OP takes in Lilly when they don\u2019t want to or have the means to that the stress could make OP abusive to Lilly?\n\nOP I mean no disrespect with this comment but I myself am raising a medically complex child and it is not easy. It is very difficult mentally emotionally physically logistically and financially. I\u2019m only able to make it work because my husband and both our parents are all incredible in helping make things manageable and because we live in the US where my son gets free healthcare. \n\nI remember when he was in the NICU and I saw all these videos of people who shook their babies and all of them were nice normal people who got so stressed beyond what they could handle with NORMAL babies that they ended up doing the unthinkable. It happens. \n\nDon\u2019t take Lilly if you can\u2019t handle it emotionally or mentally because if you do you could grow to resent her or worse. \n\nBut if your concern is only financial, please try to look at every possible option. If you adopt Lilly wouldn\u2019t she gain citizenship in your country so could therefore access your country\u2019s resources?\n\nCould your family relocate to the UK permanently? \n\nEven if you can\u2019t do so, can you be her lifelong advocate and sister while she\u2019s in foster care in the UK so that she always has someone truly invested in her future and looking out for her?", "I never said I don\u2019t care about Lily. What I meant by all that is, I can\u2019t adopt Lily, it\u2019s not an option. No amount of me feeling guilty for that being the truth will change it. I have concrete, legitimate reasons why I can\u2019t adopt Lily. I have an unlikely concept of an idea of why I shouldn\u2019t adopt Rosie. One is easy to explain, the other is not.", "The \u201cpre planned\u201d reason is school. Literally a mandatory demand on our time. Of course we\u2019d keep the girls in contact via phone, email, and visits, but Rosie would be in school 180-odd days of the year so it\u2019s not so easy to get on a flight all the time.", "Which is fine. You are given siblings you don\u2019t pick them.", "So what about the other sister? She doesn't even get a second thought. Is that not callous? A child MOT being chosen for a disability out of their control. If that isn't more callous I dont know what is. Godfobid we have disabled people to care for\n This is just a perfect thread of how society views disabled peoples. \"Hard to care for, difficult, needy\". Humans are all those things. We need to just be better. This isn't better.", "How absurd. She can be an advocate for her disabled sister.... that's not what she's doing.", "I 100% agree. Best of luck to you and your family!", "They are not citizens in the country they are currently residing in.", "Plus the bizarre argument that Rosie, who is only 2, might despise air travel. And this:\n\n> I wouldn\u2019t be able to keep much of an eye on it. My husband and I live abroad.\n\nIt\u2019s clear you want to avoid visiting to Lily. For that, YTA.", "\"Find someone who can and will keep them together\" how?", "That comment was in regards to lifestyle changes, not visiting lily. If you misinterpreted the comment, I can\u2019t help you."]}
