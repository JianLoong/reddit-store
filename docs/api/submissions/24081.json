We have an autistic son that proved \u201cchallenging\u201d in many ways. I need not go into what challenging means but at 17 we worked with social services and Derek  moved to a group facility. Really a really nice facility in the country (Derek lives the outdoors) \n\nThat was years ago. He is now 57 has his own apartment and has planned activities daily. Some with staff and some with other \u201cresidents\u201d.  \n\nWe see Derek often and he comes to our house a few times a month. He calls my wife daily (2:30pm exactly) as well as his brothers, sisters, in laws, etc. \n\nWe could never have supported Derek at home. The cost was not the issue - the emotional support /demands were never-ending. \n\nThe nice thing is the benefit given to our entire family, beyond Derek. Basically everyone has learned to be extremely tolerant and the whole family enjoys being together. \n\nNext week my wife is flying Derek to see his sister (Oregon) and other brothers (in LA) are flying up to join. \n\nSo- yes it\u2019s tough. But there are resources. And we have learned that through the thick and thin of life - Derek is the happiest. Happy every day\u2026. Well most days. \n\nSo these are at least some options to share.

Good luck with this tough decision.", "NTA. It's better to know your limitations and make decisions accordingly. Here is what you know: you know you can take in Rosie.

You can only meet the needs of one of them. It is what it is.\n\nTo me it's about accepting what you can and are ready to do. You've already made a decision about the older sister - she's not moving in with you. Accept it. Then you have to decide on the younger one. If you know you can take in Rosie, but don't, I think that is what you need to work out. At aged 2 she's still highly adoptable so get counselling and decide if you want Rosie or focus on having your own kids only.\n\nThis is a hard decision and you are a good person for trying to sort out what's best for you and the kids. It's ok if you take in one or none. And I am sorry for your loss.", "Very gentle YTA. They lost their parents, now they lose each other?

This sucks.", "I don\u2019t think there is a right answer here - you just have to do the best you can do.  Did you ask the social worker if there was a way to get support services for Lily from the state?  Sometimes when you\u2019re adopting a kid, that\u2019s an option.  Ideally, the government likes to keep families together when they can, so some states have provisions for providing support to disabled kids who are being adopted, even if they wouldn\u2019t qualify for them in their natal family.\n\nAs it\u2019s unlikely for the girls to be placed together, I think I would choose to keep Rosie, in your shoes.

It\u2019s quite probable that they wouldn\u2019t be kept together, especially considering lily\u2019s needs. It\u2019s not my decision, but I think you should keep Rosie with you (her older sister), rather than risk them both going separately into care.\n\nLater in life, you will tell Rosie that you couldn\u2019t afford Lily\u2019s level of care. You couldn\u2019t give her the level she needed, and that you could only afford to keep Rosie at the time and meet her needs. You tell her that in an ideal situation you could have financially afforded both, and that ideally you\u2019d have not needed to work and taken care of Lily. But that it just wasn\u2019t possible.

I'm so sorry for your losses and pain of the decision you are having to make.\n\nI was all set to judge you. Bc I am a parent of an 11f with Down Syndrome.  I also have a 16m. I am also poor, disabled myself and divorced from their deadbeat dad. And I love my daughter very much.  I wouldn't change her in anyway bc she has taught me so much about love, patience, acceptance. BUT. \n\nBut I made myself think about the fact that my daughter is fortunate in that she has minimal health issues. She is abt 5 yrs behind developmentally in school. (6th grade but on kindergarten or 1st level). She has major speech issues.  She's mentally on par with a 6 or 7 yr old. Sometimes she's a normal 11 yr old too. It's unpredictable. \n\nI recently had to deal with her having her first period.  How do you even explain that to a 6 yr old? It was a day I had been dreading for yrs. She came through like a trooper,  took everything in stride as is her way and I needn't have worried so much. But this is just 1 small struggle I face. I can't afford special therapies beyond what school provides. I have made peace that she will be with me forever. And if she had more medical issues? Which is more common with down syndrome? I dont know. I don't know what that would have looked like. \n\nSo I cannot judge you on this bc I didn't have a choice but I don't think I would have chosen this path if I had the choice.  It is hard, and lonely, and frustrating.  For all the good there is bad.

And one is absolutely better than none imo. So maybe see if it can be arranged so the girls can still see each other regularly.  My heart breaks for Rosie and lily. But also for you. I'm so sorry for all this pain.", "NTA, but would it be possible for you to be Lily\u2019s permanent foster parent, so (hopefully) getting more resources from social services than if you adopted?", "NTA", "NTA. I used to work in the foster care system. I can\u2019t tell you how many kids I saw \u201cage out\u201d because of attempts to keep siblings together when one of them could have been successfully adopted on their own. I also saw siblings get adopted when the adoptive parents only wanted one child and that never turned out well either. You  are also Rosie\u2019s sister. Instead of thinking about it as keeping Lily from Rosie think of it as keeping Rosie with her other sister\u2014you.", ">That said, we don\u2019t have the financial (my husband makes good money but we are supporting all our surviving parents as well as ourselves), or practical resources to take on caring for a child with additional needs such as Lily\u2019s (the extent of these was explained by the social worker).\n\nYet you were willing to try for a child yourself? Strange choice. \n\nCan\u2019t you get financial support for adopting a special needs kid? Don\u2019t you have free/cheap healthcare?", "NTA, by adopting Rosie, YOU can ensure she has a relationship with her sister, wherever she is placed. A 2 year old healthy baby doesn't sit in the foster system forever and they will most likely try to place her quickly which wouldn't include Lily in most cases as most people aren't equipped or willing to deal with a special needs child. \n\nIf you do nothing the girls will most likely be split up and her relationship with her sister might not be fostered by her adoptive family.", "YWNBTA by doing what you can to help who you can.

An even bigger commitment to take on a special needs child. It\u2019s ok if it\u2019s too much for you. Make sure that you spend heaps of time with Lily. You don\u2019t have to be Lily\u2019s primary carer to keep her place in your family.", "NTA", "The social worker was being conservative with her statement. There's almost no chance that the two girls would be adopted together. Children as young as Rose are adopted out very quickly. Children like Lily will most likely age out of the system. Honestly the best thing you could do is adopt Rose and try to maintain a relationship with her sister. You are a lot more likely to do that than another couple who is not related to her. Absolutely NTA for not taking on more than you can handle. Further down the line you may well feel like you can handle it and there's a good chance Rose would still be available if that happens.", "NTA. I don't think there's ever going to be a right answer to this. Either way you choose, you'll be left with some form of regret or what ifs. So I guess choose the regret you are willing and able to live with.", "NTA although I would urge you to explore any resources available for Lily, along with anything from your father's estate that might be beneficial to help care for Lily. You are recognizing that you don't think you can give Lily the care she needs, but can for Rosie, which is fine, but before finalizing everything, just see what is available as far as resources and funding for care.", "NTA\r  \n\r  \nThis story is heartbreaking. Clearly, you and your husband have thought deeply about the situation, and social services have encouraged this solution. No one is blaming you. You don't feel equipped to care for a child with special needs, and it's absolutely okay not to take on that responsibility. You're providing Rosie with the chance to be in a family connected by blood, where she can get to know her father through you.\r  \n\r  \nPerhaps there are ways to maintain a connection with Lily without taking on full responsibility for her?", "NTA. It seems the girls might be split up either way and this way she will be with family. She is also very young and it will probably, to be blunt, be easier to feel like Rosie is your own than Lily since you are going to raise her from the \u201cbeginning\u201d. \n\nAn argument could probably be made that you are the AH if you don\u2019t want to adopt Lily because of her DS. I wouldn\u2019t think so either. Adopting a child is no small affair and it is important that the child feels loved and safe. Adopting a child you don\u2019t think you\u2019ll be able to give that is just sound. On the other hand you\u2019d probably be an AH because of your views instead\u2026 on the other hand a child with a disability also require more attention and alters the life more so maybe it would you wouldn\u2019t be\u2026 idk, but that don\u2019t seem to be the case so\u2026  NTA", "Nah.

The social worker gave you the open and clear information they did for this exact reason: so you could make an informed decision not overrun by emotion.\n\nI can't imagine what you're thinking and feeling right now. What I will says is, taking only one of them is fine if you can only afford one, whether that is financially or mentally. But don't take *either* of them if you don't think you can handle it.\n\nKeep in mind something you didn't mention. If you take in Rosie you will one day have to tell her about Lily and explain what happened. What you were thinking and feeling and dealing with. Be ready.", "NAH this doesn\u2019t have a correct answer. If you decide to adopt Rosie, tell her stories about her adoption and you can sneak in that there is a sister who was too sick to live with you and is in more suitable place. You need a child psychologist to help with writing the story, but that way facts don\u2019t surprise her. You are a good person for trying to figure out the best outcome for the kids", "NTA.  This is just a terrible situation to be in.  There's no option that isn't painful.  I hope you find what works best.  My condolences to you and your family.", "NAH. I think it\u2019s good that you\u2019re conscious that you might not be the best home for Lily to be in but it\u2019s also worth noting that if you had a biological child (or even with Rosie) there\u2019s no telling what will happen to them and whether at any point they may develop a disability that requires additional care as well. You need to do what\u2019s best for you and your family, including the kids, whatever that happens to be.", "NTA \n\nThis is made easier by the fact that Rosie is 2. I think for that reason the splitting up issue isn't as big of a deal as you're worried about. At least not compared to her living her life in foster care or somewhere not guaranteed to be as good as your home, assuming you are confident you can provide for her a good upbringing.", "NAH, it\u2019s a complicated situation for sure. One aspect to consider is how you will talk to Rosie about her sister. She will probably have questions about her sister and you will need to be thoughtful in how you will answer.", "My state continues to give the stipend after adoption. They don't want financial reasons to prevent a child from being adopted. Kid so continues to get healthy insurance.", "As an adult Rosie will understand the financial, emotional and physical limitations her parents were faced with and understand they made a very wise decision in not letting guilt make them make bad choices.", "I get that, but I can be diligent about that, but according to the social worker, foster care probably won\u2019t be so the girls may end up apart anyway?", "Easy for you to say. OP doesn\u2019t have the finances nor does she sound mentally equipped to be able to care for a special needs child.

We\u2019ve discussed what we would do in those situations.", "There are very accurate very early tests that can tell op that if she's concerned during her own pregnancy. Having a sibling with Down syndrome generally doesn't increase your chance of having a child of your own with Down syndrome though.", "You\u2019re probably right. As I said, I don\u2019t know why I would do if an adult Rosie turned up on my doorstep and asked why I left her in foster care, with no guarantee she\u2019d go to a good situation. \n\nMy husband and I only planned on having one child. If we adopt Rosie then she\u2019s it for us, and we\u2019re both perfectly happy with that. It\u2019s just hard to close the door on her growing up with her sister and making a concrete decision that that\u2019s what\u2019s best for her. But you\u2019re right, you have to do what you can I guess.", "I don\u2019t have access to the kind of resources needed to do that as I\u2019m not a social worker? How does one go about that? Also, I live abroad. \n\nI understand what you\u2019re saying, and I don\u2019t want that to happen either. If the social worker said they would definitely be adopted together then I wouldn\u2019t be here, but she has told me numerous times that there is a very small chance of that happening.", "The chances of there being a home out there for the two of them together is low.", "You know Jack shit about the system or foster care. More than likely that Lily will be abused", "I wouldn\u2019t be able to keep much of an eye on it. My husband and I live abroad.

We\u2019re both from there so we can move there while the adoption process is happening etc., but long term we will be moving back, and the health system here is complex, especially for a non-citizen, as Lily would be, there\u2019s not a lot of help available as far as we know. \n\nYeah, that\u2019s the thing. If Rosie ended up adopted by a good family then that\u2019s one thing, but I have no guarantee that would happen. So, if someday a grown up Rosie knocks on my door having been through foster care and god knows what, I don\u2019t know that I could ever forgive myself having known I could have been a mother to her and given her everything she deserves.", "Both my husband and I feel like we are ready to be parents, we are planning to be, and we\u2019re at the right point in our lives. Obviously adopting is slightly different to going through pregnancy and everything but we\u2019ve got the names of good professionals, for us and for Rosie. I do feel like we can do this, I just don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the right thing.", "I feel like it\u2019s kind of above anyone\u2019s pay grade, but like I said, my shrink can\u2019t tell me what to do, so Reddit seems as good a place as any.\n\nThey are together now, in a short term foster home/emergency placement.", "It\u2019s great that you\u2019d be able to do that for your family, but not everyone has the same capacity or resources. This woman is dealing with an incredibly difficult choice and situation.", "We actually live abroad, so while we would move back to our home country for the period of the adoption process, long term we will be moving back. Plus, it\u2019s not just the financial aspects. Our lifestyle is fundamentally incompatible with lily\u2019s needs.", "Me and my husband spoke about that before agreeing to start planning a family. I won\u2019t discuss our choices further but it was considered.", "We live abroad currently. We can and would move back to our home country for the period of the adoption process but long term we will have to return. Obviously we would keep the girls in contact as much as possible but once Rosie is in full time education, they wouldn\u2019t see each other in person much.", "We would definitely do that. I have stepsiblings on my mum\u2019s side and my husband has a sister, we would have a plan. Also we\u2019ve been starting to put away money for a trust fund for our future child so hopefully by the time anything we\u2019re to happen there\u2019d be something available financially as well.", "The problem is, we live abroad. We\u2019re still citizens so we can and would move back for the period of the adoption process but long term we would have to return home. I would never cut off contact between the girls or anything like that, and it\u2019s not a long flight, but the reality is once Rosie is in full time education they wouldn\u2019t see each other often.", "Yeah, definitely. My therapist is on the journey with me so he knows that we\u2019ll be working on that.", "We wouldn\u2019t be adopting Rosie out of guilt. We are planning to start a family, and Rosie is already family, why shouldn\u2019t it be her?", "Yeah this is my thought. I can't blame OP but I'm so sad for poor Lily.", "We are not in the US, neither are the girls. I very much doubt that with the severity of her condition that Lily would ever be out of state care in some capacity. \n\nI understand what you\u2019re saying, but I\u2019m your experience, are the girls likely to get adopted together? Adopting Lily is not an option for us, but if someday Rosie grows up and reaches out to me, how do I tell her I could have adopted her but didn\u2019t?", "Yeah, that\u2019s what I keep thinking. If an adult Rosie turned up on my doorstep having been through foster care or even a bad adoptive home I don\u2019t know if my answer of why I didn\u2019t save her from that would be good enough.", "Yeah, no easy response here.", "I thought this, too.  OP sounds way too empathetic to get through this without regret, no matter what she chooses.  This is heartbreaking.", "It\u2019s not only a case of money.

Obviously having a child changes your lifestyle drastically but we don\u2019t anticipate that it will change enough for us to have the practical capacity to take adequate care of Lily.", "Also to add, if Rosie has a great life with OP then she may be open to contacting Lily in the future. If Rosie ended up not adopted because of Lily, she may resent Lily entirely and disown her later on down the line. \n\nOP, you've said that the sisters are living abroad in another country. Obviously, if Rosie is adopted by you, she'd have rights to live in your country with the aim to become a citizen in due course. Is there legal scope in your country to provide Lily (as your sister) with the right to live there, and be transferred to your country's foster/adoption system?

You never know what is going to happen; your child could suffer traumatic birth injury, or have another genetic illness not screened for, or a profound developmental disability, or get cancer, or have an accident. Signing up to be a parent means potentially signing up to be a medically complicated parent, ALWAYS. Just some food for thought, and something I wish everyone considered before they had children.\n\nNAH incidentally; this is an IMMENSELY difficult situation with no easy right or wrong answer.

Someone\u2019s even offered to throw me a baby shower. I\u2019m grateful for the support it\u2019s just been a lot. \n\nMy husband and I have discussed it, mostly just a rehashing of the discussions we had prior to family planning. I know for my husband it\u2019s Rosie or neither of them, which honestly is the only viable choice. \n\nOur country doesn\u2019t have free healthcare, you pay into an insurance plan. Some of it is state funded, but very very little of it is state funded if you\u2019re not a citizen, which Lily wouldn\u2019t be. It\u2019s also not just the cost.

I didn\u2019t meant to say that Lily is any less family to me than Rosie.", "No, I am asking is adopting her when her sister will remain in foster care is the wrong thing to do for her. I know I am not obligated to take Rosie, and if we do she will be very much wanted and very much loved.
