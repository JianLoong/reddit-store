{"id": 21806, "submission_id": "14v9m2v", "title": "AITA for asking my dad to choose me?", "selftext": "My (30M) dad and our extended family were raised in a codependent way. He and his siblings need to see each other at least 2x a week. When I was in high school, I was required to come with him even if I had an exam the next day or got off work late. If I didn't come with him, I got grounded.\n\n\r  \nEventually, I moved to a different state for grad school and was the first one among my cousins to get married. My wife Amy (30F) and I have been together since we were 20. She moved with me for grad school, and everyone was proud and happy. When Amy got into medical school, I had graduated and gladly moved with her.\n\n\r  \nMy parents didn\u2019t like that I didn\u2019t move back home but were happy to have a future doctor as part of the family. My dad's eldest sister Sarah (matriarch of the family), however, sent my wife terrible messages about how a woman's place is by her husband, not the other way around. Sarah told my wife to either get out of my life or be shunned from the family. My mom and dad were apparently very heartbroken by this and became stressed. My cousins fully supported Sarah's actions after seeing how stressed my parents became, because my dad is like a second father to them. Maybe even the only father figure some of them have. They claimed my wife's career was tearing apart the family, so they called other cousins, aunts, and uncles, and many either sent Amy mean messages or blocked her. After a lot of confrontations, I went no-contact with them outside of some holidays.\r  \n\n\nMy parents never stood up for Amy. They just told her that people in the family are emotional. My dad loves his extended family and still supports them whenever possible. A cousin gets fired for smoking on the job? He invites her to stay in my old. He throws many birthday parties for them. The cousins always ask for financial and emotional help, because he is so giving. One time at Christmas, I asked Sasha and my cousins why they insist on being so terrible to Amy. They said that no one had a problem with how they treat Amy, since my dad still treated them the same.\r  \n\n\nThis week, Amy is starting her first week of residency and we are also pregnant! This was not planned and we're both happy. Maybe we made the mistake of telling my parents, because one of my cousins is also pregnant and unblocked Amy just to text her that our baby will never be accepted and as loved as the others, because Amy chose medical school. That was the last straw. I tried showing my dad the message, but he said he didn't want to see it but that people are probably just emotional. \r  \n\n\nI asked him finally to choose between us and these extended family members who hurt us for no reason. My mom said that was out of the question and that I am an ungrateful child for trying to control my parents' decision making. She now blames Amy for my sudden need for them to pick a side, and I feel like the AH for inadvertently bringing more hate onto Amy during her first week of residency and early pregnancy.\r  \n\r  \n", "created_utc": 1688936348, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14v9m2v/aita_for_asking_my_dad_to_choose_me/", "score": 70, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your dad's family doesn't respect your choices because they blame Amy for everything instead of accepting everything has been a mutual decision.

Your family sounds incredibly toxic, and its obvious your dad has chosen his side.

I'm so sorry that you have to go through this. You are doing the right thing standing up for your wife. Unfortunately, I think you should be prepared for your parents to not choose you, as it sounds like they don't have the capacity to. But good people would not send so much hate onto someone, especially someone who is pregnant.\n\nI wasn't in the same situation as you, but my own father became estranged from me because I wouldn't cut off contact with my mother when they got divorced, and his family and fiends supported him in this, so I have a little taste of what you are going through. All I can say is hold those who *really* love you closer and don't waste energy on those whose love for you is conditional on you giving into their demands.", "It's time to cut contact.

To me that's even worse, it means that that person couldn't even be bothered to learn. This type of family is toxic, as codependency always ends up being.
