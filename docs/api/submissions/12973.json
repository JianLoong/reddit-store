Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. -1 Corinthians 13:4-7\n\n>But if anyone does not provide for his relatives, and especially for members of his household, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever. -1Timothy 5:8\n\nI would hope that your mother would treat you with the patience and understanding... and the *respect* we've been called to show to all of mankind.
