True Christianity is about respecting everyone's freedom to choose his or her religion. \n\nBut like what many others mentioned, from a practical point of view you might just want to play along till you and your sister are ready, then move out together.", "NTA. But you now know the price of continuing to live with them: attending church on Sunday. Either comply (do it with them) or live on your own (with your sister if you two can do it).\n\n(edited to finish - I hit return too soon)", "I got bullied into being confirmed, yet another reason to turn my back as soon as I could get away.", "No if you aren\u2019t religious then they should not make you go. It isn\u2019t fair to you.", "NTA\n\nReligion is a personal choice and parents should not try to impose their beliefs on their children especially when they are adults.", "NTA- but you need to look at the big picture in terms of your future. \n\nIf you move out with your sister- have you finished high school and what are your plans to find a sustainable career for yourself that you do not need your parents financial support to get started in? We\u2019re you looking at a college path? Trades? Military? All are good options. It may not be the path of your dreams- but your parents will financially cut you off if you move out in order to bring you back home and back to the church.\n\nI get it. Left a different church at 18. Totally support you getting out. But I would, in your shoes, make sure you have all your bases covered before the two of you make that leap.", "NTA.  I had the same conversation with my parents, declared officially after Roe v Wade.  But I hadn\u2019t gone in decades before that.  Nothing short of a funeral will get me to go.\n\nWhen I was a teen, my brother and I told them we preferred a different late mass than their early one, and just hung out shopping or at a park instead.", "NTA and I cannot stress enough how much admire your bravery towards your parents.\n\nThink about religion what you want but it the be voluntary. Religion in itself really doesn't make any sense in an age of science and progress and there wouldn't be a lot of \"believers\" if it wasn't for parents forcing children against their will to participate in church stuff.\n\nHot take: Religion =/= church. And Church is one of the biggest criminal organisations in history.", "NTA\n\nBut, if a condition of living there is going to church then you probably should until you can move out. Ending up homeless would only make things harder for you.\n\nI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re in this situation.", "NTA. If they're upset, tell them that god made you this way.", "NTA. I don\u2019t like parents who try to magnify their life\u2019s into their kids. You are you\u2019re own person. They told you to leave if you don\u2019t life their beliefs. So you made a safe plan to move out. \n\nI will say older siblings are more likely often to try and agree with parents naturally. They tend to end up and the third adult of the house, yet are still kids. Naturally becoming a bridge of reasoning between younger siblings and parents. So to her she might just want you to play along to just make it less chaotic as she may feel that you getting too involved will create chaos and put you both in a mentally unstable situation. I can\u2019t say for sure but that would be my best guess. But once again, you are not your parents second chance at life, you are not your parents clone, you are you. You have the right to believe what you want. I think something parents need to understand that just because they raised you doesn\u2019t mean you owe them your life or control of your life! You do you, and I\u2019m proud that you discovered that you are unique before it\u2019s later on!", "Nta. You have made a choice and moving out is probably a good idea.", "Nta but I understand this completely. If you not going to church is so importantthat they want to kick you out.... that's just messed up putting church before your kids.   Adult children or not", "NTA, I did the same thing. Catholicism was too creepy and ritualistic that led me to have more questions than answers so I left, tried other religions even but now I\u2019m happier being agnostic", "You aren't TA.\n\nHowever I'm going to just put this out there...\n\nA lot of times, people, no matter the age, will leave a situation very quickly without thinking thru several steps ahead. \n\nWhen you leave, make sure you leave with a good foundation, mentally and financially. A few extra months is not a lot compared to years of, for lack of a better word, freedom. \n\nI wish you all the luck and blessings this world has to give you!!!\n\nCatholic school survivor 1976-1990 :)", "NTA. I\u2019m an atheist in an Orthodox Christian family, and unfortunately your sister is right. It\u2019s better to play along for now until you can successfully move out. I also pretend I\u2019m christian and go to church if they make me, but it doesn\u2019t have to mean anything. It\u2019s very frustrating, but you heard your parents - religion is more important than keeping their own child close to them. Their love is conditional. Go along with it for now, but start looking for new places along with your sister.", "NTA.  I don\u2019t understand why parents think forcing their kids to go to church is going to do anything when they are not interested.  No matter how much you force it, you can\u2019t make someone believe something they don\u2019t, so it\u2019s just a pointless exercise in control.", "NTA\n\nAs far as I\u2019m concerned, everybody should respect everybody else\u2019s beliefs, to the extent that it doesn\u2019t affect somebody else\u2019s life.\n\nThat means you should respect the fact church is important to them, and I hope it brings them happiness, but on the other side respect the fact that you don\u2019t get the same thing out of it.\n\nYou\u2019d hope that people who learn a religion would understand the concept of respect, love and humanity, however, sadly, that isn\u2019t always the case.\n\nMy advice, be calm when you talk to them, respect their ethics and principles, point out they\u2019ve brought you up with the same principles and ethics, but you don\u2019t feel you need to go to church to live your life.\n\nGood luck.", "I agree that you should probably 'play along' until you have actually found a new place to live, because I wouldn't want you to become homeless and I've heard of parents who find public displays of religion more important than human relations with their own children. Still: NTA.", "NTA Look up what the Bible says about supporting family and then you'll see how the faux holy pick and choose.", "Keep your head down and go along until you can actually move out. They wouldn't be the first religious parents who kicked their own child out on the streets. Get your ducks in a row first.", "You are absolutely, 100% NTA. People who have a strong faith need to understand that they are not allowed to force other people to believe what they believe, or participate in the rituals they feel the need to participate in.", "NTA. Your beliefs - or lack thereof - matter, and you shouldn't be coerced into performative self erasure for their comfort. Be well.", "Basically kicking you out because you don\u2019t want to go to church? I would definitely go NC. That\u2019s excessive.", "Nta . Congrats on escaping", "Nta you can\u2019t be forced to go, you\u2019re an adult and can make your own choices. Couldn\u2019t think of anything worse than spending sundays at church so id be the exact same as you", "NTA but you are 18, so if you wanna make 18 year old choices you will have to face 18 year old consequences.  Start looking for ways to move out, or quiet down and attend church.  That's how being 18 works.", "NTA.\n\nWhat I would do, if I was feeling rebellious, is go but not do any of the rituals. Don\u2019t do the sign of the cross, don\u2019t stand up, don\u2019t pray, don\u2019t say peace. Just sit there, doing nothing. Chances are they\u2019ll be so embarrassed by you \u201cmaking a scene\u201d that they will eventually say that you shouldn\u2019t come. Do remind them that a fake believer is far worse than a non-believer and that\u2019s why you don\u2019t want anything to do with it.", "\nNTA for not going to church anymore. But living with your parents come with certain conditions. Like abiding to house rules. Not going to church was never an option. They made that very clear. You being 18 doesn\u2019t change that. Even when you\u2019re visiting them for a few days with your children when you\u2019re 45, you\u2019ll need to put up with going to church on Sundays. If that\u2019s not an option for you, go and stay in a nearby hotel\n\nEdit: lol didn\u2019t think that it would be so controversial to be realistic to save someone a fight. I stand by my words. This is not unlawful. And no, it\u2019s not OP\u2019s job to learn catholics how to be a catholic.", "NTA - it's a difficult situation for sure.\n\nMy wife's Polish (and therefore brought up Catholic too). I'm agnostic, and they tried guilt tripping my wife into getting me 'converted' to Catholicism - which included what's essentially a course and test.\n\nI don't know if this is because in Poland, Catholicism and culture are so intertwined, but most of her family claim to be strong Christians, yet have never read the Bible (I'm agnostic, and have read the Torah, Bible and Quran). For most Polish (or people from Catholic countries) I think Christianity is more about cultural identity than it is religion.\n\nTHAT BEING SAID - while you're not a minor, you're still living for free under their roof, and that comes with certain obligations. If you don't like it, then you'll need to move out unless you want to damage your relationship with your family.", "YTA\n\nI get your opinion and I'm totally against religion as well, but if it means that much to your parents, why not do it? I go to temples and stuff all the time and even though I have 0 devotion to God. Rather, I enjoy seeing my family spend time together and seeing those who are religious being happy. \n\nI'm pretty young, but I don't want to think back and regret being stubborn just because of some conflicting beliefs. \n\nHow about instead of forgoing it altogether, ask your parents for a treat or something to make it worth your while. Maybe going out for a movie or shopping after church or something could maybe make it easier for you to get along?", "Slightly YTA, you sound bitter, judgmental, a little entitled and ungrateful towards your parents. You and your parents want different lifestyles. So yeah move out do what you want it\u2019s your life. But don\u2019t talk down on your parents for practicing their religion. Be respectful. You\u2019re so caught in hating the church lifestyle you all lived you missed all of the values and principles anyone can learn from atheist or any religion.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

And that is what the church cares about. Also, the church is built on the tradition of suffering and just praying for change, instead of taking action to change something. That is dangerous heresy.", "Simply: No. If you or the parents made an effort to look up what catholicism says about forcing someone to go to church, you would find out that it is discouraged as a bad practice.", "They give catholics bad press. And the Catholic Church as a whole would indeed not like that. But I don\u2019t think that this will cause any change in the church OP grew up in. If this church didn\u2019t think that this behaviour was acceptable, they would have changed the parents minds when they disgraced a sacrament and tried to bully OP into confirmation. This church community is the \u201cholier than thou\u201d type. They will not side by OP", "Correct, but this type of people tend to ignore or dismiss what they don\u2019t like. Even the pope would not be able to get this into their heads. So I rather be realistic and save OP a crusade.", "Trust me mate, I know more about Catholicism than most for a variety of reasons.  There is very little you will find, if *anything* that says Catholics should not mandate going to church for their children.  Discipline is an important part of being a Catholic, and a fondational knowledge and education on the discipline of regular church attendance is really known as one of the greatest tools you can give your child.\n\nNot that any of that matters in the slightest, because if you live in someone elses house, it doesn't matter if you are 18 or 81, you live by the rules they give you, or you don't live there.  It's really really simple.", "\"they will never admit they are in the wrong\" is very different from your original \"it's their house and they have the right to make any rule and everybody must accept it\"  Also, I am not sure if you are catholic or excatholic like me, but there is a lot of focus on community and following of authority in the catholic church. So if your priest has a talk with you about how you should handle family affairs, you know you better follow his advice.", "No it\u2019s both. They have the right. And they will not admit to being wrong. I focused on the lawfulness, because OP\u2019s an atheist. She should take lawfulness as her standard, and this rule is not unlawful. OP shouldn\u2019t be obligated to learn catholics how to be catholic. So I disagree with you trying to get her to change her parents mind about how they practice their Catholicism"]}
