We purchased tickets for a family event which included a ticket for his elderly aunt. Traffic was so bad the streets were hard to maneuver, but with patience, it was doable. He began to get nasty with our son (7) and me because of the traffic. He raged and critiqued other drivers. We were in traffic for over an hour, I offered to drive, and he refused. The aunt was uncomfortable during the ride and started to pet his shoulder to try and calm him down. We were four blocks from the event, and he yelled, \"That's it,\" and angrily got out of traffic and drove us away from the event. My son started to cry. I said let me out with our son so we could attend, and he told me no, I was acting stupid, and he would not wait around for us when it was done. I said I would find my own way home. His aunt said \"he tried\" and felt it was too stressful and told me not to argue; it was not worth it.\n\nAfter dropping off his aunt, he told me I was an a$$hole for not understanding how he felt in traffic and that I was not listening to his needs. I told him that everyone was listing to him and that he took fun family time away from his aunt, son, and me. He told me he did not want to hear how upset I was because it was not fair to \"make\" him sit in traffic any longer.

His anger towards me. He felt fine in traffic and doing things now, but he still wasn\u2019t treating me any better.

He could hurt your son. He could storm off and leave your son in an unsafe environment or situation without supervision or help. And he acts like a giant tantrum baby. That is abnormal for an adult!

If he\u2019s seeing a therapist, maybe see if you can bring it up with them. Also, see if you can look into more in-depth, perhaps, even inpatient programs.

Why you might ask? Traffic headed to the beach. Your husband is showing your son every day, by his actions, how to treat you and all the other people in his life.
