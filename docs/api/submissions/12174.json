I remember what it was like sitting in the back of that car, trapped, while one of the people I should be able to trust most in this world became increasingly unhinged and deranged. I remember the anxiety of knowing what was coming but there was nothing I could do to stop it. \n\nMy first vivid memory as a child was having a panic attack at the school gates in the morning because dad had woken up angry that day. By the time I was in my teens I would trigger his verbal assaults because having a grown man significantly bigger than me screaming at me inches from my face was less anxiety inducing than waiting for him to explode by himself. We all knew when he was angry. The tension would be palpable. That tension was something I grew up knowing as instinctively as not touching a hot surface because my parents taught me well what that tension meant. But, like you, my mother just put up with it because it was was \u2018not worth it\u2019.\n\nSo I say this on behalf of your son, who is likely a decade away from being able to put his feelings right now into words: YTA. You\u2019re not the biggest AH- that\u2019s your husband for subjecting you both to this abuse - but you are the only one who has the power to protect your son from this and you\u2019re choosing not to. He won\u2019t stop because he knows you won\u2019t leave. He\u2019s got no reason to. (And before you all come at me for victim blaming, I know she\u2019s not responsible for the abuse but give me a moment to project my anger at my mother for not protecting me onto OP)\n\nYTA for not getting out of the car the moment the tension started to rise and forcing your son to sit there and be verbally abused because \u2018it\u2019s not worth it\u2019. YTA for not leaving until he\u2019s actually got his anger under control. YTA for not protecting your son from this man. \n\nI love my father, but I don\u2019t like him as a person. I\u2019m in my 40s and live very far from him (like in another country far - I find I love him a lot more when I\u2019m in another country) so I only have to see him every few years. When I do see him, I do not tolerate this aggressive behaviour from him. The minute I feel his anger rising, I make him aware and he knows I\u2019ll walk away if he doesn\u2019t shut it down. And he does. He doesn\u2019t have anger issues, not really. He\u2019s just never been held accountable by anyone for his anger. \n\nIf you love your son, start holding your husband accountable. Deliberately putting himself in situations a that will frustrate him so he \u201chas an excuse\u201d (in his mind, anyway) to launch a verbal assault on you and your son because it alleviates his own stress should never be an option again.

I think you believe that too, why else would you still be with him. If he owns his issues and mistakes and puts in the work he can get better, only if HE wants to.
