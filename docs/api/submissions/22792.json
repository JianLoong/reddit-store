The Barbie movie looks like it would be one of those \"brainless fun\" movies, if you're into that sort of thing. I am, when I'm in the right mood, but when something gets over-hyped and shoved in my face 24/7, I tend to drag my heels a bit and tune it out. I was that way with Harry Potter and Game of Thrones. Still not crazy about GoT and HP got iffy because of JK being an ass.  Bottom line, I'm not going to spend any extra money to go see it.
