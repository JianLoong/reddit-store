I say this as a mostly all-black-wearer who's really looking forward to seeing the movie!

I mostly wear black too, listen to metal, drink beer, you get the idea. In my experience some people take it as a personal insult like I'm trying hard to be different, a snowflake, whatever. Especially women, oddly enough. So I think OP was coming from a similar place, explaining how she gets some very much unwanted attention for that, and her share of baseless accusations.\n\nLike that delightful conversation I had with my coworkers about romantic movies, I find a lot of them a bit dumb and/or stalkerish. They immediately tied that to my style, like it's some reputation I have to uphold. (I don't. Make better movies.) I tried to explain that I do like some, but I hit a brick wall there.", "Same for me. Man, I am a metal head. My husband is a metal head. Does this keep us from watching a movie or to party with other metal heads every time they play \"I am a barbie girl\" right before a concert? She has every right not to go to a movie she doesn't want to watch, but something tells me she really just want to be edgy."]}
