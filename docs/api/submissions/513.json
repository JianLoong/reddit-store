However, 3 times in the last few months, she has used my dishes without asking first, and proceeded to leave them in the sink for several days. I'm especially upset by this because I'm squeamish with several day old bits of food, and my dishes are often surrounded/buried by other dirty dishes that are not mine & I didn't use. \nI want to know if I'll be the asshole if I ask her to wash my dishes that she uses in a more timely manner, especially because some days she can't do much.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If she is well enough to use the cooking utensils, then she\u2019s well enough to wash them. Tell her she\u2019s welcome to use them as long as they are washed that day. If not, she will need to get her own. She is using her medical condition to be lazy and you need to speak up for yourself.", "You're NTA but you're also 20 years old in college and you gotta have the grit to speak up about your butter knife in this world friend.", "Actually you can say that. You should say that and she should wash them. But like you said she is sick and she can use that to start an argument.\n\nYou need to talk on very thin line.
