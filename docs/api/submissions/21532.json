That she was going to play fairy godmother and help turn you into a magical princess bride for her beautiful boy. And that is a lovely daydream, but that's all it is, because you were never her Bridal Barbie.\n\nYou are a human being. A whole person, with feelings and a lifetime of experiences, excited for your wedding. And HER excitement about this \"experience\" should have been about experiencing all of this ALONGSIDE you, as you make these choice for yourself (and yes, perhaps even hear some of her opinions politely) on the journey to becoming a part of her family (and her son becoming a part of yours). She was meant to be happy to be present and welcomed to be your company as you took these very exciting steps towards your wedding, to share your excitement. This was not meant to be \"her party\" as it were . . . but for her to be a guest at yours. \n\nI would sit your fianc\u00e9 down, if I were you, and gently present it to him this way: that it's not about wanting to ruin his mother's excitement, but that you're concerned that she was maybe so excited that she forgot that she was the much-loved GUEST in this experience, and not the director of the show. That you very much want her to be a part of your journey, but that you're sad that she can't be excited for you as a bride and her future daughter-in-law as much as for herself. She had her wedding . . . it would mean so much to you if she could now support you in having yours. \n\nNo matter how this goes, though, you are NTA.", "NTA.  I wonder if her mother or MIL controlled her wedding so much that she wasn't able to have what she wanted.  Which could mean that's how she thinks it should go, or she's trying to get her dream wedding - forgetting that it is not, in fact, her wedding.", "NTA she needs to be living her own life not trying to live yours and your partner\u2019s lives for you. If she hasn\u2019t got enough going on in her own life to keep her entertained then that\u2019s her problem, don\u2019t let her make it yours. \n\nYou need to make sure your partner has your back.

Your fiance was upset with you? If she wanted to go dress shopping with the bride, she should have had more children. She should have at tried to have another child to get a daughter. The mother of the groom traditionally has no say in the Bride's wedding dress. This is a bride, mother, sister, best friends event. Not the mother of the groom. \n\nHe needs to step up & tell his mother to apologize. I don't see how you could have been nicer. She stepped out of her lane and you let her know to get back in.

No, there was no need for you to be \u201cnicer\u201d.

You will be depending on him to have your back with everybody, family included.  And you will have his.  That means sticking up for each other in public, and only disagreeing in private.", "This as well. If she's going to complain about wedding dresses today then she's going to complain on and about your wedding day, your first new home, the moments after delivering your children when all you'll be wanting is just support, love, and privacy to bond with your new born and husband, and when it comes to child rearing.\n\nShe clearly doesn't want to acknowledge and respect your boundaries.

But not in a fun way.", "agreed, OP has a husband problem", "I mean, she's always been obsessed with my fiance getting married, i'm pretty she planned our whole wedding the second we told her we were engaged.

As MIL,  we had no input on attendants  clothes, flowers, venue, photography.....which is as it should be.\n\nI was invited to go with bride, her mom and bridesmaids  to look at wedding dresses.

It was called her own wedding.", "His mom has always been sad about not having a daughter so he thinks i should understand that she behaves with me like she would with her own daughter. I don't know if it changes anything tho because i wouldn't want my own mom to insist on getting a dress she likes either", "The only question I had was whether OP was as civil in word and tone as reported. As presented, she was fine. The fiance's response either means she was more harsh than we were told, or he is a mealy-mouthed numpty who believes whatever mumsy says without trusting hit supposed partner.", "NTA Spend some time browsing r/JustNoMIL for preview of life with this woman & her Mama's boy.", "Oh but I'm her only kid and this is her only grandchild. She deserves to be there. \n\nOh well it may be her second grandchild now but it's her first granddaughter she totally deserves to be in the hospital room. \n\nOh I know she keeps mentioning our parenting and criticizing us but you have to understand they're her only grandchildren. \n\nAnd it will go on and on and on...", "You probably pretty much right. And nobody would be mad if she's there to support you. But it's still your wedding and not hers, so she has to accept your decisions even tho she has other things in mind.", "Well,  too bad for her.  I have a daughter and I still wouldn't be as involved as your FMIL.\n\nNTA  start building that brick wass boundary", "Make sure you have a password with all your vendors in case your vision isn't right for her.", "She can go help him find his suit/tux she has a son she can participate in his parts. You and you alone get final say on your dress there is nothing to be understanding about its YOUR dress.", "Participating doesn\u2019t mean being really rude while dress shopping. Her crying (I mean really?) at the end doesn\u2019t negate the fact she was being super rude. The dress is yours, being so opinionated and rude to you is not okay. She\u2019s pretending she\u2019s the victim to get her way. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t let her participate anymore. She lost her privileges by acting like a child who can\u2019t contain their emotions. She\u2019s too obsessed with this.", "So because she'd be overbearing and controlling with her own daughter if she had one, you just have to put up with her being overbearing and controlling with you instead? You should probably have a talk with your fiance before the wedding about the fact he's now meant to be supporting you instead of appeasing his mother", "I feel sorry for him growing up knowing that he wasn\u2019t what his mother wanted", "Well your mom needs to realize that once you're an adult, access to your life and the special moments in it are a privilege and that privilege can be revoked.\n\nShe clearly has issues with respecting you and your gfs' boundaries and wants to constantly meddle in things. What does your mom hope to benefit from?", "Oh I was just predicting the future of the relationship the OP is in. It will be one after another boundary stomped. This will be their future.\n\n\nMy m i l tried to boundary stop with me and found that my own mother had hardened me to such attempts.\n\nI am an immovable object. \ud83e\udd23", "This needs to be said to MIL, kindly as possible.
