That you very much want her to be a part of your journey, but that you're sad that she can't be excited for you as a bride and her future daughter-in-law as much as for herself.

Who the heck does she think she is? This is your wedding. She has no role other than to cheerlead and be of support when asked. It's not your job to be the daughter she wished she had. This is not the time to focus on her needs. It is a time to focus on the couple's wants, desires, and needs.
