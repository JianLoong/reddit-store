{"id": 17428, "submission_id": "13jiukh", "title": "AITA for brushing my teeth in public at the farmer's market?", "selftext": "So while going to the farmers market with my mom and brother. My breathe smelled and I wanted to brush my teeth, so I brought my tooth brush and tooth paste. As we walked out to the market I squeeze a bit of toothpaste onto my brush and poured some water in my mouth from my own water bottle to get some foaming action. I start brushing my teeth and make sure to keep my distance away from vendors and stalls. I am pretty much away from people, up until I walk up to my mom and she's interacting with a lady or potential friend for her.  The lady looks at me funny and I pause brushing to say my breathe smells, continue brushing and walk over to a water drain hole by the parking lot to spit out the foam, the area is clear and the hole is intended for rain water to prevent flooding.\n\nThe next day my mom tells me that what I did was really weird, and the lady that saw me brush my teeth didn't pick up any of my mom's calls, and it may have been because I was acting \"WEIRD\" brushing my teeth in public. I genuinely feel bad that the other lady didn't pick up my mom's calls because I want my mom to make new friends and be happy.\n\nNow my mom is upset with me and told me to never brush my teeth in public again, and framed it in such a way that she didn't want people to hurt my feelings or be unkind to me. At the farmer's market no one really cared or treated me poorly. The only people who made me feel \"weird\" and bad about brushing my teeth was the lady who looked at me with glaring eyes and my mom.\n\nTLDR: AITA because I brushed my teeth at the farmer's market, away from others, then near my mom and a random lady my mom wanted to be friends with. The next day the lady doesn't pick up any of my mom's calls and she feels like I am partly to blame for my weird public teeth brushing behavior. Mom says to never brush teeth in public again. I feel bad : (\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Scouts honor and promise to reddit and the internet to not brush my teeth in public again. I am listening and I am learning.\n\nEDIT2: In my messenger bag I always carry with me a toothbrush, toothpaste, floss, water, and mouth wash, and GUM. At my work I noticed some of my coworkers brushing their teeth, and they shared with me in Brazil it is very common to do, and also in Korea as well. I do brush my teeth in restrooms and always try to do so in a private stall.\n\nEDIT3: I talked things through with mamma bear, apologized, and she said she loves me dearly and doesn't care about the lady who didn't pick up, she just wants to protect me.

I made every attempt to be discreet- not because teeth brushing is embarrassing, but because forgetting is. Its an indicator that your grooming habits are rushed at the last minute instead of done regularly, so possibly not a priority.

We are licenced and checked throughout the day. The rule book for our municipal area of the city is 42 pages.

Farmers\u2019 markets tend to only happen weekly or monthly because compared to running old school market stalls with clothes and fruit and veg it is a really complicated organisational thing. We started prep at 4am and would be totally packed up by 6pm and that included paperwork guaranteeing everything to the rules of operation.\n\nThis could for us get the market suspended, cause other people to review us as problematic wrecking our reputation and our traders (we expected a relaxing Sunday but we were unsettled by a person brushing their teeth by the artisan cheese. In a pandemic!!!) You are shopping, but that is usually private or municipal land with the by laws and also currently a workplace.\n\nAnd while clearly I love farmers\u2019 markets I have to say the shoppers there are really different to street markets.
