While we were gone, my mother (50F) and her boyfriend (20M) threw a party, which his little brother (7M) attended. \n\nWhile he was here, he completely trashed my brother and I\u2019s rooms. When we returned, in my room, he had dumped out my trash can and scattered the trash all over the room, and in my brother\u2019s, he dumped out all of my brother\u2019s markets and multiple baskets of his things.\n\nUpon returning to see this, I was frustrated. The party had happened several days before we came back, so they had plenty of time to clean up after him but they just\u2026 didn\u2019t. In my fit of frustration, I did snap at my mom, asking why there was trash scattered throughout my room and why the child was let in in the first place.\n\nI did later feel remorseful and apologize, and they did clean up my room after being confronted about it, but they didn\u2018t clean my brother\u2018s. I find it rather impolite that they let this seven-year-old enter our rooms without our permission, let him scatter things everywhere, and didn\u2019t even think to ask him to clean up nor clean up until confronted about it.", "created_utc": 1672586612, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/100lt73/aita_for_wanting_my_moms_boyfriend_to_clean_up/", "score": 341, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Are you able to spend more time with other family members like your grandparents or your father? \n\nGenerally I find it pointless to judge an age gap but in this case there is a serious gap in maturity between a 50 year old mother and a 20 year old. Your mom's boyfriends maturity is closer to yours than it is to hers, and it sounds like you're more mature than he is.  The addition of throwing a party, trashing you and your brothers room without any concern shows her head might be not in the best space. It's not your problem to solve- she is the adult.  I am guessing this incident isn't the only thing that has happened in your life lately. Do you have any adults in your life that you can talk to about this?", "NTA, but your mom is dating someone who is old enough to be her son.", "Whoa\u2026. That\u2019s a big age gap \n\nINFO: how does the bf treat you?", "NTA - your room is your private space, nobody else's kids should be messing around in there. Mom needs to get her act together and make it clear to her boyfriend that his kid isn't allowed to trash rooms.", "NTA, Not sure who taught you manners, but you did not get them from your mom apparently. That is a really rough homecoming. And you are right, that 7 year old had not business in your or your brother's room. Why did they not clean his room up?", "I\u2019m sorry your moms a creep. NTA.", "Is this for real?\n\nYour mother is a cougar? Wtf lmao", "You are NTA!  Your mother and her bf should definitely clean up your brother\u2019s room. Doesn\u2019t matter that you are the kids - they are being RUDE!", "NTA. Please go to [al-anon.org](https://al-anon.org) and look at the resources for teens. I'm sorry your mom is a train wreck, please do what you can to help yourself and your brother.", "Also unless there's some kind of special needs situation going on, a 7YO is more than old enough to be expected to not just trash a room like that.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The boyfriend is generally polite, but it seems like my mom has a tendency to sway him the wrong way, as she is an alcoholic, and when drunk no one\u2019s head is right.\n\nI\u2019ve told my grandparents about her drinking, and my grandma wanted me to stay, but my grandpa talked her out of it, and now she\u2019s trying to stay here and just talk to my mom, but she\u2019s worried about her getting defensive, snapping, and forbidding her from allowing to speak to us (though I think what is more likely is my mom would start a huge argument and take the anger out on my brother and I after my grandma departs).", "Grandson in Alabama", "The boyfriend is generally polite towards my brother and I, and likes to talk with us and play games with us, yet my mom tries to get him away from us and more towards her, and sways his decision-making", "And a bad mother", "Unfortunately it\u2019s real, I thought it was weird at first too \ud83d\udc80", "I am so so sorry sweetie. It sounds like you have really tried to mend the situation and it's falling on deaf ears. If your grandparents are unable to help is there another adult in your life you trust?", "If the roles were reversed, she\u2019d be called a creepy old man, which is correct.

Thank you for your advice and help though, I really appreciate it, and am trying to talk to my grandma about it :)", "Lmao right?! I was trying to understand what the mum meant by that.

Wish you the best and sending strength towards you <3", "Hi dear. I just wanted to let you know that:\n\n1- you are NTA, this is a ridiculous situation. The bf is exposing his school aged brother to substance using adults. \n\nAnd 2- you DESERVE BETTER. You are inherently deserving of your parents\u2019 love, care, and respect. You deserve a safe and stable home, where people take responsibility for their roles, behaviors, and share of work. \n\nAsking adults in the home to clean up messes they\u2019re responsible for is not mean, it\u2019s holding them accountable. You cannot control how others act, but you can choose to advocate for yourself and your brother. \n\nTalk to someone at your school, a teacher or social worker, who can help you get the resources you need. A counselor would also be helpful, as you\u2019ve been exposed to some very unhealthy dynamics that are influencing your understanding of personal responsibility and appropriate boundaries. Living in a home with a substance used is an adverse childhood event (ACE) and can affect your relationships in the future, if you don\u2019t get help. \n\nAgain, none of this is your fault. You deserve better. All the hugs.", "Seriously tho. I'm 40 and my oldest (of 3 children) is 21. So squicky.", "Oh it\u2019s weird all the time, not just at first.

He probably has more in common with you and your brother than he has with your mom.", "I\u2019m sorry the whole \u201cif the role were reversed\u201d it would look worse in society. Older women and younger man is seen as less weird", "I think this is good advice. Tell someone. Teachers are mandated reporters of child abuse and neglect. What\u2019s happening is not ok.", "It sounds more like part of a gaslighting attempt to me, to minimize it and make OP feel like they are the one reacting poorly and being ridiculous. If successful, this would create doubt in OP and make it harder for them to stand up for themselves in the future. \n\nOP, NTA, and I'm scared for you in this situation, along with your sibling and even your mothers bf. I was groomed at 21 by a 38yr old. \n\nTake photos and try to document things (privately) as they happen. Date, and as much detail as you feel you should add. Do not let your mom know about it.", "Ok, going to put this huge age gap to the side. Your mom is 50 and knows as a mother of 2 that she needed to keep little kids out of your rooms. She also knows that she and her boyfriend are 100% responsible for cleaning up after the boy. NTA", "NTA. Is there something wrong with this kid? Why is he playing with trash? Why are your parents allowing a child to sift through trash cans? Gross.", "NTA.   \n\n\nYour mother's boyfriend is basically another child, and it's good you set a boundary.", "NTA.  Get a lock on your door.", "I\u2019m an asshole and would tell his parents.  Bill them for whatever needs to be replaced.", "50 and 20? that's not a boyfriend that's a boytoy!

Hell, even I\u2019m a teenager and I still wouldn\u2019t dream of acting this way towards anyone.\n\nI\u2019m unsure of the details of the party, as I was absent and I doubt my mother would happily disclose them truthfully to either my grandma or I, and my brother probably wouldn\u2019t care much to ask. I think my mom and her boyfriend were supposed to be babysitting, though.\n\nAnd yes, my mom is an alcoholic so unfortunately, liquor was served. I recall calling her during the party to wish her a merry Christmas and she even sounded blackout drunk, I could barely understand a word she was saying. The boyfriend\u2019s mom is a drug addict, and she eventually showed up and started to beat my mom and her boyfriend, and that\u2019s all I know (which is an entirely different story to unpack I\u2019m so sorry but so much happens here).\n\nThank you for your kind words, I appreciate it so much :)", "I get they are consenting adults but the dumb logic gets me...\n\nIf the roles were reversed, as she said, then you would start dating a 45 year old.  \n\nWould she be ok with that? My guess is probably not ..", "Me too, I don\u2019t like it at all but really, there\u2019s not much I can do about it because her defenses are only \u201cit\u2019s legal\u201d, \u201cif the roles were reversed\u2026\u201d and \u201cwhy do you support the LGBTQ+ but not this?\u201d", "grandma to the little brother", "She\u2019s robbing the cradle for real lol", "NTA, but your mom is dating someone who is old enough to be her son.", "Thank you so much, your words really do mean a lot to me. :)\n\nUnfortunately I\u2019m online schooled, so I cannot reach out to a school counselor, but I am hoping something happens while my grandma is visiting here so she can see just how severe the situation is and hopefully take my brother and I for at least a few months, and give my mother real consequences so she can actually correct her behavior. Again, your words mean a lot to me, thank you so much <3", "24/7/365 weird", "Agreed, I\u2019ve told her that but all I\u2019ve gotten is the \u201cit\u2019s legal\u201d argument. It can be legal but still be weird", "Hey you can also look up free mental health resources online. Sometimes we need someone not connected to us to vent to and get advice, just like this Reddit post. But somewhere dedicated to mental health is safer and they can often point you in the right direction for other services :)", "If you go to the drs or a dentist they are also mandated reporters. Be honest and tell them you think your mom needs help.", "Oh boy. Mom needs some therapy. She\u2019s stunted age wise. I work with people like that. You\u2019re more adult than she is."]}
