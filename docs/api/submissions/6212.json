While we were gone, my mother (50F) and her boyfriend (20M) threw a party, which his little brother (7M) attended. \n\nWhile he was here, he completely trashed my brother and I\u2019s rooms. When we returned, in my room, he had dumped out my trash can and scattered the trash all over the room, and in my brother\u2019s, he dumped out all of my brother\u2019s markets and multiple baskets of his things.\n\nUpon returning to see this, I was frustrated. The party had happened several days before we came back, so they had plenty of time to clean up after him but they just\u2026 didn\u2019t. In my fit of frustration, I did snap at my mom, asking why there was trash scattered throughout my room and why the child was let in in the first place.\n\nI did later feel remorseful and apologize, and they did clean up my room after being confronted about it, but they didn\u2018t clean my brother\u2018s. I find it rather impolite that they let this seven-year-old enter our rooms without our permission, let him scatter things everywhere, and didn\u2019t even think to ask him to clean up nor clean up until confronted about it.", "created_utc": 1672586612, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/100lt73/aita_for_wanting_my_moms_boyfriend_to_clean_up/", "score": 61, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Are you able to spend more time with other family members like your grandparents or your father? \n\nGenerally I find it pointless to judge an age gap but in this case there is a serious gap in maturity between a 50 year old mother and a 20 year old. Your mom's boyfriends maturity is closer to yours than it is to hers, and it sounds like you're more mature than he is.  The addition of throwing a party, trashing you and your brothers room without any concern shows her head might be not in the best space. It's not your problem to solve- she is the adult.  I am guessing this incident isn't the only thing that has happened in your life lately. Do you have any adults in your life that you can talk to about this?", "NTA, but your mom is dating someone who is old enough to be her son.", "Whoa\u2026. That\u2019s a big age gap \n\nINFO: how does the bf treat you?", "NTA - your room is your private space, nobody else's kids should be messing around in there. Mom needs to get her act together and make it clear to her boyfriend that his kid isn't allowed to trash rooms.", "NTA, Not sure who taught you manners, but you did not get them from your mom apparently. That is a really rough homecoming. And you are right, that 7 year old had not business in your or your brother's room. Why did they not clean his room up?", "I\u2019m sorry your moms a creep. NTA.", "Is this for real?\n\nYour mother is a cougar? Wtf lmao", "You are NTA!  Your mother and her bf should definitely clean up your brother\u2019s room. Doesn\u2019t matter that you are the kids - they are being RUDE!", "NTA. Please go to [al-anon.org](https://al-anon.org) and look at the resources for teens. I'm sorry your mom is a train wreck, please do what you can to help yourself and your brother.", "Also unless there's some kind of special needs situation going on, a 7YO is more than old enough to be expected to not just trash a room like that.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
