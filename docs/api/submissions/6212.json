The party had happened several days before we came back, so they had plenty of time to clean up after him but they just\u2026 didn\u2019t. In my fit of frustration, I did snap at my mom, asking why there was trash scattered throughout my room and why the child was let in in the first place.\n\nI did later feel remorseful and apologize, and they did clean up my room after being confronted about it, but they didn\u2018t clean my brother\u2018s.

Your mom's boyfriends maturity is closer to yours than it is to hers, and it sounds like you're more mature than he is.  The addition of throwing a party, trashing you and your brothers room without any concern shows her head might be not in the best space. It's not your problem to solve- she is the adult.

The bf is exposing his school aged brother to substance using adults. \n\nAnd 2- you DESERVE BETTER. You are inherently deserving of your parents\u2019 love, care, and respect. You deserve a safe and stable home, where people take responsibility for their roles, behaviors, and share of work. \n\nAsking adults in the home to clean up messes they\u2019re responsible for is not mean, it\u2019s holding them accountable. You cannot control how others act, but you can choose to advocate for yourself and your brother. \n\nTalk to someone at your school, a teacher or social worker, who can help you get the resources you need. A counselor would also be helpful, as you\u2019ve been exposed to some very unhealthy dynamics that are influencing your understanding of personal responsibility and appropriate boundaries.

Hell, even I\u2019m a teenager and I still wouldn\u2019t dream of acting this way towards anyone.\n\nI\u2019m unsure of the details of the party, as I was absent and I doubt my mother would happily disclose them truthfully to either my grandma or I, and my brother probably wouldn\u2019t care much to ask. I think my mom and her boyfriend were supposed to be babysitting, though.\n\nAnd yes, my mom is an alcoholic so unfortunately, liquor was served. I recall calling her during the party to wish her a merry Christmas and she even sounded blackout drunk, I could barely understand a word she was saying.

Online classes should also provide some kind of counsel. You are so well spoken and sound so intelligent, educated and smart, that you could be a major success story, get yourself out of that toxic environment, even ask legal counseling for emancipation from your mother, and work towards putting all that mind into something bigger.

Do you have better options than living with an alcoholic?\n\nI wish I had understood what was happening when this happened to me, but I don't know how much it would have helped.  If validation is helpful, you have mine; your family life is not what you deserve.  You were not wrong to expect your mother and her boyfriend to practice some sort of discipline with his brother, and you were not wrong to expect them to clean up after him when they failed.  You are not wrong to suspect the age difference between your mom and her boyfriend is not healthy.  She is wrong to equate that with anything to do with alternate sexuality.  You deserve a chance to be the child in this relationship, and it is heartbreaking that she is not stepping up to be the mom.  I'm sorry.", "NTA and this whole situation is super weird and messed up. How does your mom\u2019s boyfriend\u2019s family feel about their relationship? It seems very weird that they\u2019d let their 7-year-old run amock at a party and make a mess, playing with literal trash. Is this typical behavior for your mom? Or is she dragging everyone down with her in her midlife crisis? Idk how you would even go about this in your situation and at your age but you need a door that locks from the outside. And new parents.", "I'm so sorry. I've spent time as a person your age dealing with adults like that. All you can do is forge your own path. Thank goodness for your more stable relatives. \n\nChaos is hard when you're a reasonable person. My thoughts are with you and your brother.", "Ok I know it sucks, but it is time to tell someone else. Maybe seek out your own therapist online or see if your school counselor/teacher can recommend one. Situations like this can get really dangerous very quickly (even though this is already really bad, I\u2019m sorry), so you just need to have a foot in the door with someone else, who can jump in to help. \n\nAnother reason I\u2019m suggesting you start talking to a therapist is to protect your future. Speaking from experience here - kids raised in households like this become desensitized to abuse, neglect, etc. when we start dating people. For example, I knew my mom was a p.o.s. so I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d fall victim to an abusive relationship\u2026 but I definitely did. It was just different than the abuse I grew up with, and I was desensitized to it bc it \u201cwasn\u2019t as bad.\u201d \n\nI would pay big money to have realized how numb I was sooner, so that\u2019s my wish for you.

On the other end of the monitor is still a real-life teacher and those people are obligated to report anything suspicious to the authorities.

I wish you and your brother the best!", "Uhh surely that depends on your country or state.", "NTA. Yes it's legal and all but her actual children should always come first, at least until you guys are adults. I'm guessing she's partying pretty hard and mentally checked out. That's not good for the two of you, and heck, it's not good for the kid either to be around all that. I really hope your grandparents can be the support you guys need!"]}
