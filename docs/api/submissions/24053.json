We don't even allow smoking in the house,  I don't smoke in my car and we both do our best not to bother non-smokers.

I agree she\u2019s not the AH, but i\u2019ve never seen someone so out of touch with the smoking issue. You say smoking is \u201cnow low-class and unacceptable\u201d, it always has been. Tobacco companies never marketed to the informed and educated, they market specifically to the low-class as a thing rich people do. Why? Because they\u2019re more likely to smoke and it\u2019s easier to convince them to smoke. When your life consists of working 12+ hours a day, a little dopamine hit from a cigarette is sometimes the only bit of joy you get in the day. In third world countries, they\u2019re so cheap that someone who can barely even afford food and shelter can easily afford them. That\u2019s why it\u2019s considered \u201clow-class\u201d (which is supposed to be an insult?). Also, pressuring someone to quit never works. They need to quit themselves. You can have your whole family tell you to quit for years and you still won\u2019t. It changes your brain chemistry, not to mention the huge genetic component to addiction. My grandad and his brothers smoked, my dad smoked, and I also picked up the horrible habit. I didn\u2019t want to, somebody offered me one and I just woke up one day and realized I was addicted. Nobody *wants* to be addicted, they just are.

Granted, he's noticed and he doesn't like it. He feels like he can't watch the show because it drives me away. Which doesn't make sense to me. I'm not telling him to stop watching it. I don't force him to watch my hallmark Christmas movies or when I put on a sitcom and watch it over and over, and it doesn't bother me when he leaves.", "OP has no obligation to accommodate a smoker.", "does the friend know you don\u2019t like smoking? i mean, i guess it would be hard to miss. idk, when you pull out your stinky health destroyer (hi, i smoked for years and it was not good for me) you do kinda have to respect that some people won\u2019t wanna stick around for it. \u2026and telling you you\u2019re acting up like he\u2019s your dad or something is just obnoxious. if this is a relationship you\u2019re very attached to, just tell him you\u2019re not going to stick around when he lights up and let him decide from there, but either way, nta.", "Where I live, cigarettes are extremely expensive.

He is the one starting off the behavior, it is on him to not be rude.  \u201cI am about to light up a cigarette, can we continue the conversation when I have finished?\u201d  Would be an example of the person who is creating the problem taking responsibility for the outcome. \n\nManners are not meant to force others to be polite in the face of rudeness.", "That\u2019s not really how having friends over at your house works though.
