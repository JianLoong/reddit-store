You taught them nothing, and you made your wife (your partner) feel less than equal in this dynamic. \n\nYou're not wrong in thinking that your daughter shouldn't always be told yes, and while your sons are clearly VERY sweet young boys, I understand that you don't have an issue with them or a power dynamic between the kids, but you don't want your daughter to grow up entitled and selfish. \n\nHOWEVER, you are handling this HORRIBLY. \n\nTeach her in other ways, let your sons dote on her, and teach all three that they are all equal, and while it's great to indulge one-another, it's good that they ALL reciprocate and treat each other that way, not just a one-way street. \n\nThe way you're doing it is achieving nothing. \n\nPS: Apologise to your wife for marginalising her views and unilaterally making a decision on how to parent your children despite knowing her side of things. Very dismissive attitude, and you suck for it. You're wrong for how you acted, and she deserves the apology for that.

Do you have any actual reason to believe that they\u2019re being forced into acting this way by your wife or pressured by your daughter? It seems more likely that they just know they\u2019re older and twins with a unique relationship, and they\u2019re trying really hard to ensure she knows they love her and want to include her. It baffles me that angers you so much when I think it\u2019s something to be proud of.\n\nYou could have just said, \u201cthat\u2019s a very sweet gesture, but I think this would be a more special gift as a birthday present.\u201d Instead you chose to blow up at your whole family.", "INFO: were your sons ever encouraged to engage in pretend play like tea parties by themselves?

Toy marketing tends to push girls towards that kind of play and boys towards the more physical, but kids really need both. What if one or both of them really enjoys tea parties? You just didn\u2019t know that because they never had a chance to explore those kinds of activities.\n\nSoccer is great, but it can be nice to change things up sometimes. Also, a really nice benefit of having an opposite-gender sibling is that you get exposure to things you might otherwise be discouraged from playing with.\n\nTry to be open to your sons honestly enjoying tea parties and see if things still feel as unfair.", "YTA!

The fact she howled when she didn't get something and the boys offered to give up their chance at a something so she could get the toy is very odd for children unless it has been taught to them. I'm guessing mom has been telling the boys to be good brothers they need to do whatever their sister says and that sister can get whatever she wants and if it's to expensive they should give up their share for her.

They don't have to be directly told to indulge her whenever she's sad or doesn't get her way. If mom indulges sister whenever she gets mad about something and the boys see mom struggling to keep her under control and buy her compliance, they would learn that giving sister what she wants to \"help\" mom.

And that's what these boys are doing.", "I love my Daughter. I love my Sons. I treat them all the same and i want all of the equally happy and I want that the needs of all my kids are met. I will not apologize for that.", "You would have been completely in the right to say that each kid has their own budget to spend on themselves. You could have said \u201caww, that\u2019s so thoughtful but it\u2019s important to be fair so each of you will get an equal gift. Your sister will have to pick something in her budget\u201d Keep emphasizing the importance of fairness and explicitly telling them that it\u2019s important to you that they are treated equally. But the way you approached it makes you look like an AH to everyone rather than having a teachable moment. \n\nRegarding play, it\u2019s common for the younger child to go along with the oldest. They will grow out of it as they get older. It\u2019s not harmful", "You need to have a calm and concise conversation with yer boys away from mom to get a gauge on what home with mom is. Then talk with your wife about what you have noticed and spoke with her boys about. But more importantly you need to take each kis out to do stuff by themselves so they gain value as individuals and you get to know them as individuals. But make sure that odd giving up a trip toy to make sister happy is not the norm. I could be wrong about guess and you may not have noticed the equal time and effort the boys do get. Remember you aren't around all the time, so are seeing one part of the picture. Also make sure when you talk with your wife it's about the boys giving up their toy so sisters tantrum stopped, that's the big point. The tea time isn't so bad or spending time doing what she likes. But that giving up a toy so she could have the expensive toy you said was more a gift gift not a trip toy was a big problem as that's not usual for 10 yr olds. Plus the tantrum is  concerning too", "She's the baby of the family. You're making up wild stories in your head. The only person who is obsessed with gendered favouritism is yourself. \n\nYou're acting like your sons have been parentified; which is all kinds of hilarious to me given the state of the world.\n\nMy son and daughter were the same when my daughter was born. It's not because she was a girl; it's because she's baby. Girls do the same with little brothers all the time. \n\nDidn't stop them from conflicts when they were teens and my son absolutely had to learn to hold back because he grew to 6 feet tall. \n\nYTA", "I think it\u2019s something else. she wants her boys to treat women the way she wants to be treated. shes raising them to be subservient husbands\u2026 which can hurt them in the long run if they end up with domineering narcissistic women trying to recreate that relationship. they need to be taught to say no.", "I am the sexist?! What about the mother who thinks her own sons need to be around their sister all the time to act civilized?", "That\u2019s a fantastic Idea. Thank you! I will talk to my Mother and my Wife about this.", "No chance she's catered to \"constantly.\" I am betting she doesn't dictate the dinner menu, e.g. And she's 8, so presumably she goes to school where her classmates and teacher don't just bend to her will. Dad seems to barely tolerate her.", "Y\u2019all have some weird views of family. I can\u2019t keep dishing out therapy like this. \n\nNothing was \u201cat their expense\u201d they are CHOOSING to do what she wants \ud83d\udc80 an 8 year old can\u2019t force them to do anything.", "It\u2019s weird that you think kids have such an incapability to genuinely love their siblings without being \u201ctaught\u201d it lol\n\nWhat if the boys sacrificing for true sister is what brings them happiness? What if they are happy when she is happy? Oh", "They're kids. I have a brother and we would do anything for each other. I prefer stories like this to stories of \"my kids hate each other and always argue\"", "It says the sister is \u2018sad\u2019 not that she\u2019s throwing tantrums. And yeah, my brothers used to be the same, I was the middle child, the 2 younger than me used to leave me out a lot, so my 2 older brothers used to play my games with me, it made me really happy. And I love them for it, because they didn\u2019t have to\n\n\nShould the boys have time to themselves? Absolutely\u2026 but should they be the ones to decide when and where. Absolutely. \n\n\nAnd here\u2019s an idea\u2026 why doesn\u2019t OP spend some time with his kids playing too. Spend some one on one with each. Sounds like the parents aren\u2019t engaging as much as they should", "\"started to cry\" != 'tantrum'\n\nAnd punishing an 8 year old; just losing it on her at the store because her brothers thought the problem was money, when the problem was the dad trying to play mindgames with young children. \n\nMaking a grandiose gesture to kids to get them something 'nice', then berating them in public because they don't understand your mind games would more easily qualify as a 'tantrum' then an 8 year old girl who decided to choose a practical pair of boots when told she could pick out something 'nice'. BOOTS! FFS BOOTS! \n\nY'all are both hateful or brain damaged. The two little boys were made to feel that they had to protect the young sister from their dad. That little maneuver is gonna cost you.", "YTA and you do not sound like you love your daughter at all. sounds like truly despise her.", "I agree with equal treatment of all of your kids, but your words are dripping with resentment for your daughter.", "Bro, stop watching bald guy with Bugatti or jestertophsinsen videos and see this for what it is: siblings being siblings. Is she coercing them? Bullying them? Forcing them? Or are they just protective of her?\n\nFfs, people call me old fashioned, this new wave of \"what if the roles were reversed\" is making me cringe. If the roles were reversed, Itd be two sisters adoring their handsome brother. Let your boys love their sister, wth is wrong with you?", "Dude, that\u2019s your wife. It doesn\u2019t really sound like you like her, but you chose to be with her and have kids with her, so consider having a real, honest, non-combative conversation with her instead of villainizing her on Reddit.", "It sounds like at home, she is catered to constantly by her siblings.   I'm not sure what a dinner menu has to do with anything.", "By at their expense I meant expense of time and items. They are playing what she wants and when she wants but she isn\u2019t reciprocating. Similar incident in the store, where they gave up their items to purchase hers. It\u2019s a very unequal dynamic. And it\u2019s unhealthy. On the outside as kids it seems like they\u2019re doing something nice, but as adults the behavior they\u2019re exhibiting is called \u201cenabling\u201d.", "It's the extreme that's taught not the normal love. If that's the case I'd be wondering why they give up everything they like for her, it's more dad's noticed and wife is too happy about it and saying it's normal despite dad not agreeing. The part that sold this is abnormal is they toy situation. The boys knew to give up their toy for sister, that's a give and take most 10 yr olds don't know about unless told. And that sister has a tantrum because she's denied he wanted expensive toy and brothers jump to stop he crying by giving up their happiness, give me golden sister vibes.", "As long as you\u2019re doing things for each other, that is awesome. That is not what sounds like is happening in the OP\u2019s narrative.", "This is not true. I resent the current situation but I could never resent my baby girl. Never ever. I was angry when writing here (again the situation made me angry not my daughter) and maybe it now looks this way but I can assure you it is not the case. I will talk to my wife. I will talk to my boys and navigate the situation. I want to nurture the relationship they have with their baby sister and at the same time also doing the stuff they like to do.", "The catering to sister comes from the boys giving up their toy so she could have a toy she was told was too expensive. That's learned or taught to them. As at 10 it's odd to make that connection without some other stuff going on. Because that idea should be in a child's head, give up what you like so someone else can be happy or less difficult.", "Maybe daughter does things for them too. From op's narrative it seems that he kind of resents his daughter. Which might be why the boys are being extra attentive to her.", "I mean, sure, you can teach your kids to think about other people's feelings. Most parents I know try to teach that. And if you think that's odd for a 10-year old, you need to hang out with a better class of 10-year old. It's just so weird to me how many people in this conversation think it's somehow unusual for kids to be kind and generous. Sure, they can be little shits sometimes, just like the rest of us. But kids can be really amazing humans.", "I try not to assume things. Just going by what the OP wrote."]}
