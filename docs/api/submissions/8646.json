You taught them nothing, and you made your wife (your partner) feel less than equal in this dynamic. \n\nYou're not wrong in thinking that your daughter shouldn't always be told yes, and while your sons are clearly VERY sweet young boys, I understand that you don't have an issue with them or a power dynamic between the kids, but you don't want your daughter to grow up entitled and selfish. \n\nHOWEVER, you are handling this HORRIBLY. \n\nTeach her in other ways, let your sons dote on her, and teach all three that they are all equal, and while it's great to indulge one-another, it's good that they ALL reciprocate and treat each other that way, not just a one-way street. \n\nThe way you're doing it is achieving nothing. \n\nPS: Apologise to your wife for marginalising her views and unilaterally making a decision on how to parent your children despite knowing her side of things. Very dismissive attitude, and you suck for it. You're wrong for how you acted, and she deserves the apology for that.

Do you have any actual reason to believe that they\u2019re being forced into acting this way by your wife or pressured by your daughter? It seems more likely that they just know they\u2019re older and twins with a unique relationship, and they\u2019re trying really hard to ensure she knows they love her and want to include her. It baffles me that angers you so much when I think it\u2019s something to be proud of.\n\nYou could have just said, \u201cthat\u2019s a very sweet gesture, but I think this would be a more special gift as a birthday present.\u201d Instead you chose to blow up at your whole family.", "INFO: were your sons ever encouraged to engage in pretend play like tea parties by themselves?

Toy marketing tends to push girls towards that kind of play and boys towards the more physical, but kids really need both. What if one or both of them really enjoys tea parties? You just didn\u2019t know that because they never had a chance to explore those kinds of activities.\n\nSoccer is great, but it can be nice to change things up sometimes. Also, a really nice benefit of having an opposite-gender sibling is that you get exposure to things you might otherwise be discouraged from playing with.\n\nTry to be open to your sons honestly enjoying tea parties and see if things still feel as unfair.", "YTA!

The fact she howled when she didn't get something and the boys offered to give up their chance at a something so she could get the toy is very odd for children unless it has been taught to them. I'm guessing mom has been telling the boys to be good brothers they need to do whatever their sister says and that sister can get whatever she wants and if it's to expensive they should give up their share for her.

There's nothing wrong with it, it's completely natural, and playing with \"girls' toys\" didn't effect him in the slightest as a grown man with a family of his own. \n\nYes, you do need to teach your kids about fairness, but the way you went about it was all wrong. Throwing a tantrum in a store does not set a good example. As someone said, the appropriate response would have been to tell them that although the gesture was kind, they each needed to choose something for themselves in the budget allotted, including your daughter.\n\nYou need to apologize to your wife and quit interfering in your children's relationships with one another.", "YTA. My sons are the same way with their little sister. They absolutely adore and dote on her. My husband nor I did anything to \u201cmake\u201d them be this way, they just are. They\u2019re kind, compassionate young men and I am so proud of them. Your sons seem like absolute gems and if you continue on like this, you\u2019re going to ruin the relationship they have with their sister. \n\nAlso, your comments throughout this thread just drip of resentment toward both your wife (whom you refer to as \u201cthe mother\u201d) and your daughter (whom you call a brat.) I think if you find the kindness your sons show to your daughter so mind boggling, it says far more about **you** than them. Seek help, seriously. You\u2019re going to implode your family with this attitude.", "YTA\nYou could have told the boys: \" Ah, that's really sweet of you, but I want to buy you all a present, not just for your sister.\" and continu looking for a present for each of the kids.\n\nI do wonder though, why the boys treat their sister like that. It's not something I have ever witnessed (mom of 3 aged 16, 18 and 20, and I'm a childminder).", "NAH\n\nI think it\u2019s reasonable to not want your daughter to be spoiled and to let your sons know they don\u2019t have to sacrifice to give her whatever she wants. 8 is old enough to know she can\u2019t always have her way or get what she wants. So it makes sense to check in and make sure they aren\u2019t being encouraged to give up stuff for their sister. But once you got your answer, let it go. Yes, monitor the situation but let them do what they are doing. For the store, a simple no is just fine. Then explain it\u2019s a treat for everyone and no one person should only get something. The age difference isn\u2019t that great for their to be a lack of understanding on anyone\u2019s part. Also it does sound like she\u2019s lonely. Your sons are twins and have each other so they want her to feel included. Let them do their big brother thing while making sure she acts appropriately for her age and the sons don\u2019t go without. You can do that without making anyone feel guilty or unfairly punishing your daughter. I do think you should talk to your wife. Yes it can be cute but it can also lead to your daughter being spoiled. It\u2019s a delicate balance.", "YTA. Sometimes that\u2019s how older siblings are with their younger ones. I did the same thing when me and my little brother were growing up. It was because I loved him and felt partially responsible for him. We were best friends when we were growing up and we still are now.", "YTA. I also have twins and a younger one, and I would give my arm for them to have this kind of relationship instead of endlessly bickering. If you are worried about your sons, take them out for a one to one with you and ask them how they feel about family relationships. They might be perfectly happy making her happy. After all, it feels good to be kind and to be able to think of yourself as a kind person. If it bothers them, then you can have a talk with your daughter and tell her what you\u2019ve notice, and let her know you are going to try to make things more fair in the future. You are lucky to have such sweet kids.", "What an idiotic misogynistic response", "No, just no.", "She's not a baby anymore, though. She's eight. He didn't handle this well, but an eight year old should be able handle hearing \"no\", and \"pick something in a more reasonable price range\". Nice is nice, but nice isn't always good.

That's a very small age difference.", "You\u2019re not wrong to be concerned, since your daughter does sound like she\u2019s acting spoiled. But you\u2019re going about all this wrong. If you\u2019re worried about them always doing what she wants, why don\u2019t you ever start an activity with the 3 of them you know the boys like? Take them to the park to play soccer. Maybe even split the twins up on teams, you with one twin and your daughter with the other. Because she may feel excluded being the non-twin. If she has a tantrum about wanting to do something else and not soccer, you remind her that the family came here to play soccer. If she doesn\u2019t want to participate in soccer, she can sit and watch. The family is not changing the activity because she wants to. She either participates or she watches.\n\nBefore you go to the store, you teach them more about the value of money. \u201cI\u2019m giving you $10. You can get anything you want for up to $10. If you want something more expensive, you can either save this money and combine with the money you get later and buy it next week (or however long it takes) or keep that item in mind for your birthday or Christmas.\u201d Be firm that you don\u2019t want the combining of money because you want them to learn the value of money, saving, patience, etc. Because you can\u2019t tell them it\u2019s because the boys needs to be more selfish or that their sister is spoiled.", "All that and all you took away was the wife comment\u2026YTA - my daughter has twin cousins who are boys and a year older and guess what. They play what she wants to play because most of the days the twins are together, at school, doing what they love there\u2026 With each other.

That\u2019s so awesome, girls used to be made fun of for that kind of stuff by boys. Unless the daughter has some kind of blackmail file, I\u2019m not seeing coercion. \n\nTo answer your question, yes older girls need to include a younger boy. Yes he gets to suggest activities and yes the girls can agree to those every time if they want to. If there is a conflict then they can take turns. There is a difference between the two scenarios bc historically if girls wanted to be included they had to opt for neutral or boy stuff. It was very uncommon for a boy to participate in a tea party and now I see dads and siblings doing it all the time and it\u2019s wonderful.", "I don't think you or I could make that determination based on the post.

Maybe that needs to be addressed but I wouldn't exclude at all that (rather than a gender or \"mom's manipulation\" thing...) it's the twins being very sweet and wanting to overcompensate the \"not all of us are twins\" situation and it shouldn't be assumed that it's something weird/manipulation.", "The person I was responding to said counselling was urgently needed.  It isn\u2019t.", ">it\u2019s common for the younger child to go along with the oldest\n\nthe sons are older", "approached it like a kid throwing tantrum himself", "I think mom may be doing it accidentally because there is a point in a young boys life (at least mine) where we\u2019re taught about chivalry and treating girls right so the boys may be taking that as being a doormat to their sister", "I disagree. He's recognizing a favoritism that isn't healthy. Is she actively telling the boys to favor their sister? Who knows. But she is actively enabling it. It isn't healthy for any siblings, of family members, even friends, to constantly give into the wants and demands of another person. He is one hundred percent valid for being upset. Yea, he got mad and showed his temper and made everyone go home. Holy moly, that is not a trauma, and he's not an AH for showing some frustration at a general situation.\n\n\nEveryone gets frustrated and sometimes goes off the cuff. Yes, even in front of children. No human is perfect. He wasn't abusive in any kind of way. It sounds like he's at his wits end and needs his wife's support to raise children equally. This situation isn't benefiting anyone long term.", "Where are you getting that from?", "Have you ever considered that your children all enjoy spending time together? That maybe as much as your sons enjoy other things, they also like having tea time together? I\u2019m sure as your children get older they\u2019ll naturally start to drift apart into their own interests more, and you should encourage it, but right now they\u2019re forming a bond that will hopefully last their entire lives, beyond the point where you and your wife are no longer around. \n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019d be an A-hole for not letting your daughter get the boots. But everyone here can see an undercurrent of misogyny in your post, that likely isn\u2019t intentional. But so deeply engrained. \n\nYou keep asking what if the genders were reversed. That\u2019s something men tend to ask over and over and they can\u2019t seem to accept that our reactions would be the same.\n\nIf your wife truly has planted this behavior in your sons brains, then it\u2019s still ESH because you\u2019ve reached a point where, intentionally or not, you\u2019re trying to pull your children apart, and allowing yourself to have outbursts over it in front of your children.", "My dude calm down, firstly your boys are lovely and yes I think they should cater to their needs as well. However I think youre speaking out of turn, they clearly love to spoil their sister as they wouldn\u2019t do it so frequently and happily if they don\u2019t. What I do think you should do, is encourage your daughter to join your brothers in their activities sometimes and try teach her to also spoil her brother since she loves them and so teach her to show her love. I dont know why you are victimising your boys and your gender and talking about role reversal because that\u2019s irrelevant. Thhe underlying factor is that your boys love their sister, this would have been the perfect opportunity to teach them about how loving people doesnt mean always putting yourself last for them. Teach them about healthy love so that they also don\u2019t carry it on into future friendships/relationships. Also why are you so against your wife? Have you heard her tell your sons to give up their things? Have you seen her exclude them in favour of your daughter. You\u2019re kind of right but you\u2019re really trying to find a bad guy and your poor wife is being painted as a villain. I would have said N A H, but the way you\u2019ve handled this makes me think there is more to the story and you have misogynistic views. NEWSFLASH, your boys aren\u2019t weak or gullible because they like to make their sisters happy and please do not project your misogyny onto them as they seem lovely.", "Also (of course every family is different) it isn't weird that for some years, the \"little children of the family\" is the prince/princesses... This dynamic is even more stressed when it's all older daughters and a younger brother, or all older brothers and a younger sister. Of course it can become excessive but most things mentioned by OP aren't even deserving to be mentioned as worrying (for example them wanting to do tea party instead of her wanting to play soccer... Usually it's normal that the easier/less demanding activity is done to please the youngest; learning to play sports is another level of difficulty and it's also way easier that someone just doesn't want to put effort into that compared to other immediately fun activities that requires no particular effort).\n\nOther aspect: they are twins. Twins often have their whole world. I wouldn't be surprised if the sister noticed and was a bit sad once or twice... and them as a response are \"overbalancing\" because they don't want her to think she is less. And they do \"their\" things alone and they perceive it as a long enough time. When it's twins involved, some dynamics can be more difficult. Maybe the boys need some \"confidence shot\" but I don't know, OP isn't exactly describing a worrying scenario. The only too much is the shop scene but even that one was blown out of proportion by OP.", "Well it sounds like the tea party is only 1 part of it. At the store, they went out of their way to sacrifice their own purchase just so the sister could have what she wanted. She wasn't told a hard no, just that it was too much for a shopping trip and fit more for a birthday. Her breakdown and their immediate sacrifice to make her happy definitely isn't just about gender roles.\n\nBeing taught to be selfless in every situation no matter what is not healthy. People need to learn when to be selfish so they don't turn into doormats, and a shopping trip to get what they want is a very apt time to teach that.", "Older by 2 years!!", "I mean, sure, mom could be accidentally reinforcing this behaviour, but in the other comments OP also says: \n\"-Yes. I have talked to them several times. They said, that their sister feels sad when they are not playing with her (playing with her of course means playing whatever SHE wants and never what they want) and that they like spending time with her and making her ,,a part\u201c of them. I directly asked them if their Mother has her fingers in this and instructed them to act this way. They say she didn\u2019t but I can feel that something is going on behind my back.--\"\nSo when directly and undirectly asked, the boys say no, the mom ISN'T making them act like this.\nIt really sounds like OP has already decided, that his wife is a manipulator, and that really, really does not make a healthy homelife.", "He gave two instances where his twins voluntarily decided to do the thing their little sister wanted to do with no indication whatsoever that they were upset, unhappy, or unwilling to do so.  He seemed more upset that his manly man sons would rather attend a tea party with lil sis than play the manly man sport of soccer.", "Let's say that one of his responses to this situation is go doing camping with the boys and \"maybe the daughter can do fun activities with her mother\". I am starting to think that maybe the twins genuinely saw that their sister (or the \"opposite gender sibling\" in other families/TV show) is excluded and they are trying to avoid it. Maybe exaggerating, sure. But OP responses kind of point in a \"soft enforcement of gender roles\" mentality (and as a consequence, \"the dad can only have real fun with the boys\") that the twins may have noticed. As well as noticing that maybe there is something off between OP and the mother and are trying to create their little world so she can be happy and they distract her (again, not a weird possibility at all considering that he thinks his wife is a mastermind manipulator).", "This is the commenter turning op's logic against him", "Right, two big sister adoring and playing with their little brother sounds adorable. How can OP possible think the reserved genders would be an issue?\n\nNow, there *could* be an issue with the sister taking advantage of her brothers' kindness (which isn't out of the ordinary for child behavior) and I think the parents should monitor to make sure they all learn to treat each other equally and take turns. But OP's insistence that this is a sexism issue and his inclination to blame his wife, and not the result of normal childhood behavior, makes me think this is all in his head and he's got his own issues with gender roles. \n\nLike, one of his examples is that the boys would play tea party with her instead of soccer. What if the boys just wanted to play tea party with her? It sounds like the idea OP is struggling to believe his boys would want to do a social activity over an active one, or that they would want to play with their little sister at all, and I think that's being really unfair to the boys and letting them explore what they want to do.", "Yta", ">Reply\n\nDid it ever occur to you that spending time with their little sister makes the boys happy? Did it ever occur to you that you're the only one in the house who looks at your daughter, who is 8, as an entitled brat who forces everyone to do what she wants and MUST get her way? Seriously, get a reality check and handle your internalized misogyny.", "Well you resent your wife. It's more of a general dislike for your daughter.", "And about the shopping trip\u2026 taking OP\u2019s tone into consideration, which reads like resentment towards his daughter, I wonder if the reason why the boys played \u201cknights\u201d as OP puts it and offered up their item so their sister could get her boots is because OP was being unkind or unfair in denying her the boots. Obviously there\u2019s nothing wrong with telling a child they can\u2019t have something but something about the OP\u2019s attitude towards his daughter makes me wonder if there was more to it and perhaps the boys were just trying to make it up to her.", "You know whats also not healthy? Dad full on flipping out and storming out of the shopping centre because of his conspiracy theory that his wife hates his sons. It seems very possible to me that the boys stepped in to stop their sister crying because they knew an explosion from their dad was going to happen if she didnt stop. \n\nBased on the information we have, I don't think the mother is the problem, I think its a different parent.", "Everything you said goes back to my point about them mistaking chivalry to being a doormat\n\nI am not saying that mom is doing this but for example a 10 year old may not see the difference between helping mom out around the house and parentification and the same is possible with this\n\nI don\u2019t personally think mom has purposely done anything malicious and I think the kids genuinely care about their sister and her happiness but at some point one of the parents need to see that this is an issue that needs to be addressed and resolved sooner rather than later", "BINGO. The boys might actually enjoy tea time but he can't even fathom that because it's gaaaaaay.", "But the boys don't indicate in any way that this is the case tho?\nWhen directly asked if mom had anything to do with this, they didn't say anything in the style of \"mom says you should be nice to girls\" or \"mom says that sister is sad if we don't include her\" or something. You'd think that if there was this huge push from the mother for he boys to be chivalrious, they would at least acknowledge it in some manner?", "What part of accidentally are you not understanding? \n\nSimple things such as \u201cbe nice to your sister\u201d because she was crying one day because they didn\u2019t want to play something with her can be misconstrued as do whatever your sister wants if not told otherwise and it isn\u2019t directly telling them to behave this way\n\nI\u2019m saying this as somebody who has been a 10 year old boy before and as somebody that is a father to an almost 5 year old boy simple things that as adults we understand to have nuance don\u2019t always register that way in a child\u2019s brain and it\u2019s not malicious or intentional but if not noticed and addressed as early as possible it will cause issues in the future", "I get this weird feeling that you are missing point and arguing against something that I really did not say.\nI mean, you did reply in my comment where I said \"I mean, sure, mom could be accidentally reinforcing this behaviour,--\" so I don't get why you keep on arguing this.\nI am saying that OP is TA because he clearly has a huge issue with his wife where he is constantly accusing her of manipulation, when there is zero evidence that she is, you know, manipulating. Accidentally reinforcing certain behaviour is not manipulation."]}
