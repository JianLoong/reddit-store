You taught them nothing, and you made your wife (your partner) feel less than equal in this dynamic. \n\nYou're not wrong in thinking that your daughter shouldn't always be told yes, and while your sons are clearly VERY sweet young boys, I understand that you don't have an issue with them or a power dynamic between the kids, but you don't want your daughter to grow up entitled and selfish. \n\nHOWEVER, you are handling this HORRIBLY. \n\nTeach her in other ways, let your sons dote on her, and teach all three that they are all equal, and while it's great to indulge one-another, it's good that they ALL reciprocate and treat each other that way, not just a one-way street. \n\nThe way you're doing it is achieving nothing. \n\nPS: Apologise to your wife for marginalising her views and unilaterally making a decision on how to parent your children despite knowing her side of things. Very dismissive attitude, and you suck for it. You're wrong for how you acted, and she deserves the apology for that.

Do you have any actual reason to believe that they\u2019re being forced into acting this way by your wife or pressured by your daughter? It seems more likely that they just know they\u2019re older and twins with a unique relationship, and they\u2019re trying really hard to ensure she knows they love her and want to include her. It baffles me that angers you so much when I think it\u2019s something to be proud of.\n\nYou could have just said, \u201cthat\u2019s a very sweet gesture, but I think this would be a more special gift as a birthday present.\u201d Instead you chose to blow up at your whole family.", "INFO: were your sons ever encouraged to engage in pretend play like tea parties by themselves?

Toy marketing tends to push girls towards that kind of play and boys towards the more physical, but kids really need both. What if one or both of them really enjoys tea parties? You just didn\u2019t know that because they never had a chance to explore those kinds of activities.\n\nSoccer is great, but it can be nice to change things up sometimes. Also, a really nice benefit of having an opposite-gender sibling is that you get exposure to things you might otherwise be discouraged from playing with.\n\nTry to be open to your sons honestly enjoying tea parties and see if things still feel as unfair.", "YTA!

The fact she howled when she didn't get something and the boys offered to give up their chance at a something so she could get the toy is very odd for children unless it has been taught to them. I'm guessing mom has been telling the boys to be good brothers they need to do whatever their sister says and that sister can get whatever she wants and if it's to expensive they should give up their share for her.

There's nothing wrong with it, it's completely natural, and playing with \"girls' toys\" didn't effect him in the slightest as a grown man with a family of his own. \n\nYes, you do need to teach your kids about fairness, but the way you went about it was all wrong. Throwing a tantrum in a store does not set a good example. As someone said, the appropriate response would have been to tell them that although the gesture was kind, they each needed to choose something for themselves in the budget allotted, including your daughter.\n\nYou need to apologize to your wife and quit interfering in your children's relationships with one another.", "YTA. My sons are the same way with their little sister. They absolutely adore and dote on her. My husband nor I did anything to \u201cmake\u201d them be this way, they just are. They\u2019re kind, compassionate young men and I am so proud of them. Your sons seem like absolute gems and if you continue on like this, you\u2019re going to ruin the relationship they have with their sister. \n\nAlso, your comments throughout this thread just drip of resentment toward both your wife (whom you refer to as \u201cthe mother\u201d) and your daughter (whom you call a brat.) I think if you find the kindness your sons show to your daughter so mind boggling, it says far more about **you** than them. Seek help, seriously. You\u2019re going to implode your family with this attitude.", "YTA\nYou could have told the boys: \" Ah, that's really sweet of you, but I want to buy you all a present, not just for your sister.\" and continu looking for a present for each of the kids.\n\nI do wonder though, why the boys treat their sister like that. It's not something I have ever witnessed (mom of 3 aged 16, 18 and 20, and I'm a childminder).", "NAH\n\nI think it\u2019s reasonable to not want your daughter to be spoiled and to let your sons know they don\u2019t have to sacrifice to give her whatever she wants. 8 is old enough to know she can\u2019t always have her way or get what she wants. So it makes sense to check in and make sure they aren\u2019t being encouraged to give up stuff for their sister. But once you got your answer, let it go. Yes, monitor the situation but let them do what they are doing. For the store, a simple no is just fine. Then explain it\u2019s a treat for everyone and no one person should only get something. The age difference isn\u2019t that great for their to be a lack of understanding on anyone\u2019s part. Also it does sound like she\u2019s lonely. Your sons are twins and have each other so they want her to feel included. Let them do their big brother thing while making sure she acts appropriately for her age and the sons don\u2019t go without. You can do that without making anyone feel guilty or unfairly punishing your daughter. I do think you should talk to your wife. Yes it can be cute but it can also lead to your daughter being spoiled. It\u2019s a delicate balance.", "YTA. Sometimes that\u2019s how older siblings are with their younger ones. I did the same thing when me and my little brother were growing up. It was because I loved him and felt partially responsible for him. We were best friends when we were growing up and we still are now.", "YTA. I also have twins and a younger one, and I would give my arm for them to have this kind of relationship instead of endlessly bickering. If you are worried about your sons, take them out for a one to one with you and ask them how they feel about family relationships. They might be perfectly happy making her happy. After all, it feels good to be kind and to be able to think of yourself as a kind person. If it bothers them, then you can have a talk with your daughter and tell her what you\u2019ve notice, and let her know you are going to try to make things more fair in the future. You are lucky to have such sweet kids.", "What an idiotic misogynistic response", "No, just no.", "She's not a baby anymore, though. She's eight. He didn't handle this well, but an eight year old should be able handle hearing \"no\", and \"pick something in a more reasonable price range\". Nice is nice, but nice isn't always good. In this case, it's not creating a fair situation for all of the children.", "They are 10 and she is 8.  That's a very small age difference.", "You\u2019re not wrong to be concerned, since your daughter does sound like she\u2019s acting spoiled. But you\u2019re going about all this wrong. If you\u2019re worried about them always doing what she wants, why don\u2019t you ever start an activity with the 3 of them you know the boys like? Take them to the park to play soccer. Maybe even split the twins up on teams, you with one twin and your daughter with the other. Because she may feel excluded being the non-twin. If she has a tantrum about wanting to do something else and not soccer, you remind her that the family came here to play soccer. If she doesn\u2019t want to participate in soccer, she can sit and watch. The family is not changing the activity because she wants to. She either participates or she watches.\n\nBefore you go to the store, you teach them more about the value of money. \u201cI\u2019m giving you $10. You can get anything you want for up to $10. If you want something more expensive, you can either save this money and combine with the money you get later and buy it next week (or however long it takes) or keep that item in mind for your birthday or Christmas.\u201d Be firm that you don\u2019t want the combining of money because you want them to learn the value of money, saving, patience, etc. Because you can\u2019t tell them it\u2019s because the boys needs to be more selfish or that their sister is spoiled.", "All that and all you took away was the wife comment\u2026YTA - my daughter has twin cousins who are boys and a year older and guess what. They play what she wants to play because most of the days the twins are together, at school, doing what they love there\u2026 With each other. Especially since both parents work, then they are at daycare together. If your family is close to the same your kids only have the weekend and after school with their sister. \n\nCould she be told no, yes. Redirect her. Make it a game tell her the price limit and send them on a hunt. Your boys generosity and kindness isn\u2019t bad but they just need direction. Yelling eff this and storming out isn\u2019t teaching them crap.", "I was a little sister who did everything for my big brother. Nothing to do with encouragement from my parents, I just idolised him. It would have been really weird for our parents to make it such a big deal like you have.", "The statements say that the kids choose to do this over other things they like. He even says they treat her like a princess. They even stood up for their sister at the store. He\u2019s mad they wanted to have a tea party with their sister. That\u2019s so awesome, girls used to be made fun of for that kind of stuff by boys. Unless the daughter has some kind of blackmail file, I\u2019m not seeing coercion. \n\nTo answer your question, yes older girls need to include a younger boy. Yes he gets to suggest activities and yes the girls can agree to those every time if they want to. If there is a conflict then they can take turns. There is a difference between the two scenarios bc historically if girls wanted to be included they had to opt for neutral or boy stuff. It was very uncommon for a boy to participate in a tea party and now I see dads and siblings doing it all the time and it\u2019s wonderful.", "I don't think you or I could make that determination based on the post.  So I guess my reaction is sure, it could be, could also be something else.\n\nI just think emotional manipulation is a trait of a low quality person so I'd make every effort to nip it in the bud if possible.", "I'm not saying they need counseling, but I wouldn't hurt to show the daughter that she can't always get what she wants and show the sons that it's ok to do the things they want. I don't think the situation is anything to get super upset about, but these behaviors could eventually become concerning, not saying they will just that it can't hurt to make sure", "He doesn\u2019t seem to like his wife or daughter much. He talks about them both as if they\u2019re evil masterminds manipulating the boys. I think OP\u2019s problem is not that his wife thinks boys are \u201cuncivilized\u201d, but that he thinks girls and women are manipulative and sneaky.", "Deranged is the perfect word for it", "Oh that\u2019s a good point. The boys might be so loving towards their sister because they\u2019re trying to compensate for their father\u2019s resentment towards her. Meanwhile, he\u2019s blaming his wife for poisoning the boys even though they outright denied she was doing such a thing.", ">. I believe they are told to act this way by their Mom. I have no evidence for this\n\nYeah, so the real problem is your relationship with your wife. You have no evidence, your sons have said nothing that would point to this direction, but no. You still think she must be this horrible manipulator and on the side you talk in a kind of resentful manner about your daughter. YTA, talk to your wife, this ain't healthy.", "Or are you just so against your boys doting on your daughter because you love your girl less?", "Surely OP is TA then for demonstrating low quality traits to all of his children by punishing them without explanation, reason or even logic.", "Your tone says otherwise. Kinda sounds like you resent your daughter for bringing out the softer side of your sons.", "So they\u2019re just sweet thoughtful selfless kids and OP is mad about it? It actually sounds like OP might have some hang ups about gender, like why make a big thing about them playing tea party with their sister? Maybe they like playing tea party.", "This should be the top answer!", "!!!", "The twin boys are the *OLDER* Children.", "Your baby girl? Are you talking about the girl you called and entitled brat?", "Rain boots aren\u2019t a toy, pretty sure the shopping they were doing was for clothing."]}
