{"id": 30236, "submission_id": "17mvawc", "title": "AITA for not wanting to babysit on a saturday because it means I have to be out until 12.30am?", "selftext": "Stick with me here, I'm not the best at explaining everything so if this gets confusing - I apologise in advance.\n\nSo my sister (24) and her partner (30) have recently had a baby (almost 5 months old, who I will call LO throughout this story). It is coming up to my sister's birthday and she is going out for the night to watch a musical.\n\nThe original plan was for her friend (27f) to watch LO for the night as she has a baby who is a similar age and this was agreed since before both babies were born. However, my sister has recently said to me she doesn't want friend to watch the baby as they have different parenting styles (fair enough) and it made her feel uneasy to leave LO with her.\n\nI have since made plans for this night but when my sister asked me if I could watch LO (2 months ago), I agreed and have now cancelled the plans I had. For context, I live a 50 min drive from sisters house which isn't ideal but I had assumed since the original plan was for friend to have LO over night, I was too. So having approached the conversation of LO sleeping at my house (2 days ago), sister acted shocked and said she wasn't comfortable with this and not ready for LO to sleep out yet.\n\nNow, I totally understand not being ready for your baby to stay out however this was the OG plan that she seemed comfortable with besides the fact she wanted someone else to watch her. So when I asked for the timings of when they'd be out until sister told me the musical starts at 7.30, is on for 2 hours 55 mins (basically 3 hours) meaning they'd get out for about 10.30 ish and then have to uber home which would take atleast 30/45 mins meaning they'd be home for (earliest scenario) 11.30/11.45pm.\n\nWhen I said to sister this is a bit unreasonable as this means we would then have to drive back home and this means we wouldn't get in until 12.30 ish she hit back with 'well the past few saturdays you have been out since midnight anyway so what's the difference of one more when you're spending time with LO so it should be an easy yes, and it's my birthday. You get every saturday to yourself I'm just asking for one. Do I not deserve that?' - I thought this was completely out of order as she chose to have a baby, this isn't my responsibility/problem that she doesn't get weekends out now\n\nand I'm around in the week atleast once a week to help them have a break, I will get to them after work for 6pm and completely take over until I leave the next day.\n\nThis hurt my feelings majorly but she thinks that there's no issue with what she said and still thinks I owe her the weekend? Is it me who is in the wrong\nEDIT- \nWe can\u2019t stay the night as she has nowhere to host us and has refused a double air mattress. My partner has to come as I don\u2019t drive so he will be driving me.

I've watched some of my family members push around other family members nearly on a daily basis once they agreed to babysit on their terms.
