I'm saying NTA because I don't think you were trying to hurt anyone and it doesn't seem like step-sis was hurt even unintentionally. Your mum may be a minor AH for being so heavy handed, but also I would question the wisdom of making you share a room instead of the two sisters. Two years isn't enough of an age gap to justify that imo and it seems like she (and your stepdad) may have been attempting a bit of social engineering by forcing you two together.
