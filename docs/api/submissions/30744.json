We are worth so much more than this.  As a 14 yo I would urge you to focus on education, on developing strong interpersonal skills, in enjoying life and figuring out who you want to be.  Your personality is so much more important than your looks.

I'd also watch youtuber mathew Hussey (watch now to prepare yourself for when you're older and ready to date, you're 14 enjoy your childhood a little longer) to teach you about men and how to didge men like your father as we often when getting older date simular men as that's what we're used to and is somehow feels like comfort when in relaity it makes everything worse. You got to put the work in for self love, manifesting and growth. You're perfect just the way you are!

Discover a form of activity you enjoy doing and people won't be able to stop you doing it.\n\nIt may be culturally unacceptable to point out the raw truth to your parents, but it categorically *should* be unacceptable to nag your child into neurosis over their food intake. Unlike smoking or drinking, everyone *has* to eat something to survive. \n\nIf OP's parents catch sight of this thread: FGS stop and think what you're doing. Encourage healthy eating & stop nagging her & making her paranoid about everything she puts in her mouth. Everyone has to eat in some form to survive. Do you really want to induce anorexia in your child?", "NTA\nWhat you said was exactly right. He is worried about how you \u201clook\u201d and not your health. Your mom should have defended you. \n\nFirst off, I hope you feel better soon, and that you see a dr for whatever is causing this. Losing weight quickly like that is serious, and indicates something is wrong. \n\n2: having a couple extra pounds (sorry, American here and I\u2019m ignorant of other terms) is not a problem, it does not detract from your beauty, and should not be even mentioned by your father. Your worth and beauty are not tied up in looking like a cookie cutter Barbie doll. \n\nAnd again, I can\u2019t comprehend how he isn\u2019t more concerned for your health? \n\nYou gave him a reality check that he desperately needed. He is mean, and has no issue hurting by your feelings, but god forbid you defend yourself. Now his \u201cpoor feelings\u201d are hurt?

It started age 6/7. \n\nI remember snippets of my parents\u2019 conversations about me. How they are thin people with \u201cnormal\u201d sized bones. How I must be sneaking food. How unhealthy I looked. How I come from people with a smaller frame so I must never over eat or I would become a danger to myself. \n\nMy mother would tell stories of how she would force feed me as a baby and how I would throw up. How she would have to clean me up and start the process again. \n\nWhen I was 7 a picture was taken of me and of course I still had a little baby fat. I was shown that picture to demonstrate how my fat was unsightly. \n\nAgain, a picture of me at 10 was kept to show my fat. It was shown to me and spoken about-explained how I was fat and not very pretty. \n\nI was constantly accused of sneaking food. I wasn\u2019t. \n\nWhen I was 14 the forced fasting diets started. I was given a piece of bread with mustard and a thin slice of deli meat. That was supposed to fill me up and carry me through the day. No extra food was given and no lunch money for school was given. I was allowed a small apple for a snack and then a portion controlled dinner. I was 14. \n\nBy the time I was 15 I was actively trying and participating in fasts with my mother. She encouraged it. Also we worked out together like crazy. \n\nStill they said, \u201cYou must be sneaking food.\u201d\n\nI remember being so hungry. I would dream about food. One day I was in the kitchen with my mother and she gave me a can of tuna and said, \u201cThat\u2019s your lunch for today!\u201d\n\nWhen I opened it I was shaking so much from hunger that my hand slipped and I sliced my palm open on the can. The sight of all the blood leaving and the hypoglycemia I was experiencing cause me to faint. \n\nI was told to, \u201c Stop being dramatic.\u201d\n\nI remember multiple times of being dragged around by my hair to to scale to weigh me. Pushed and pulled onto the scale. Enduring the humiliation of standing on the scale while my mother screamed at me about the numbers and my father stood silently, his face also contorted into disgust at me. \n\nI was 5\u20196\u201d and weighed 135ish pounds. Not even remotely overweight for my height. \n\nThe constant policing of food. Comments about my body. It never stopped. Not even as an adult. \n\nWhen I moved out and was able to get food for myself I went overboard. I packed on the weight and stayed overweight for a long, long time. \n\nOver two decades I learned how to help my body feel good and be healthy. \n\nEven when I took off the weight and I was finally in a good weight range for my height my mother decided to slap away my hand from something I wanted to eat. I was 42 years old. I owned my own home. Had children and a husband. Completely independent. \n\nThat day without thinking I smacked her hand back. Hard. God. That felt good. And it shut her up. \n\nWhen I asked my father why he never stepped in and stopped horrible things from happening he didn\u2019t really have anything to say. Not even \u201csorry for not protecting you\u201d or something generic like that. \n\nThere were many things that happened over my lifetime with my parents. Since they couldn\u2019t treat me respectfully I have since cut them off. There is much abuse in my life story. I could fill volumes of books. \n\nMy point is that children grow up and become independent adults who can pick and choose who to spend their spare time with. I choose not to have anything to do with my family off origin. They are all toxic and not nice people to me. \n\nI will never understand why my mother did what she did. I will never understand how my father could sit by and watch what she did and never step in. Since they choose not to change then what is the point of spending what time I have on this planet with them? \n\nI look back at pictures of me and I grieve for that little girl. At 7 I was healthy. Just the baby fat in the cheeks. All those pictures show a little girl who is in a healthy weight range with a forced smile and sad, empty eyes. \n\nI see those eyes still when I look in the mirror. I try every day to make it my best and do my best. I no longer wish to die every day. I teach my children to listen to their bodies and help them learn why certain foods have more nutrition than others. \n\nBut hear this parents of OP: you get one chance to have a lasting impact on your child, don\u2019t you want that to be a positive one?!?!\nWhat will your legacy be?", "You are the exact height and weight as me, I would've had the same reaction as you did.

I'm 42 and even though I'm probably small or skinny to others, I still feel very low about my physical appearance. I think I have body dismorphia. He seems to be projecting his shittiness onto you and good for you for standing up to him. Keep doing that when he feels the need to comment on your physical appearance", "NTA. My dad used to make similar comments. I tried talking to him several times and making him understand how much it hurt me, but it didn't work. It wasn't until I exploded and said very, very offensive things to him that he finally stopped. At the time, it took around 2 months for us to talk normally again, but it's been years since then, and he hasn't mentioned my weight again.

That\u2019s so rude and gross of him, and him commenting on your food and portions is also rude and uncalled for, and everything everyone else already said here.", "NTA.

I'm sure he wants you to be fit, healthy, and happy in your body. But he needs to clearly channel that better.\n\nYou're angry, but it's clear that you want to resolve this.

Their favorite name was \"piggy\" When I'd come to the table my father would make oinking noises. They encouraged my brother to it. It completely blocked any self-esteem I might have developed. Even when I lost weight in high school and looked great, I always felt like a \"fat pig.\" Years later I asked my mother why she did it. She said  \"we thought we could shame you into losing weight.\" Don't let your parents do this to you. Bravo you for having the confidence to stand up to him. Yeah, granted he was hurt. How hurt were you every time he said something derogatory about your looks? Maybe sit down and tell him how much he's hurting you and that's why you lashed out.", "NTA - And you shouldn't apologize to your dad. He needs to apologize to you.

And honestly, does he think the attention of men is what, women want these days? There's never been such a time in history where women are more disgusted by men than now. Those kind of comments are in part exactly why that is.\n\nFuck your dad. Never apologize for standing up for yourself. He's the one who went too far.

I also made peace with my father. He apologized. Said he never wanted to hurt me, but was worried about my getting fat. If I followed the pattern of my mother, I would have would been fat, with type 2 diabetes, circulation problems, high blood pressure, diabetic neuropathy, clogged heart.
