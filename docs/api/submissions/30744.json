I (29F) have a chronic illness and pretty bad mental health problems. Due to a combo of a new med and even worsening depression, I\u2019ve unintentionally lost 9kg since July from having no appetite. I used to weigh the same as you and I was perfectly healthy (weight wise), now I can see my ribs and my thighs no longer touch, which is a weird sensation.\n\nMalnourishment really fucks you up. I feel so weak all the time, my brain fog is even worse than normal, and I just feel shit about myself in general. The amount of people who say \u201cI wish I had that problem!\u201d about me unintentionally losing weight is insane. People don\u2019t seem to be able to comprehend that someone losing weight without trying, who doesn\u2019t need to, isn\u2019t having a good time.\n\nWhat you said to your dad was pretty mean, but what he said to you was way worse.
