We are worth so much more than this.  As a 14 yo I would urge you to focus on education, on developing strong interpersonal skills, in enjoying life and figuring out who you want to be.  Your personality is so much more important than your looks.

I'd also watch youtuber mathew Hussey (watch now to prepare yourself for when you're older and ready to date, you're 14 enjoy your childhood a little longer) to teach you about men and how to didge men like your father as we often when getting older date simular men as that's what we're used to and is somehow feels like comfort when in relaity it makes everything worse. You got to put the work in for self love, manifesting and growth. You're perfect just the way you are!

Boomers gotta learn it's not cool to make comments about people's bodies", "NTA AT ALL!\n\nGood for you for standing up for yourself. Not enough people do that in this world. It's a good trait to have in life. You're Dad is an asshole and your Mom is a bitch for sticking up for him. You did nothing wrong, so don't feel like you did.

Make sure the message sinks in. Same with your mother", "My mum, sister and I have fielded these comments from my dad as long as I can remember and it fucking sucks. My sister did too, went through an incredibly unhealthily skinny period as a teen. I spent the good part of my adolescence/early adulthood with BED. My mum is now orthorexic, it was so scary at first people thought she had cancer. \n\nOf course, he kept congratulating her on the weight loss and continued to make comments on everything we eat until about 2/3 years ago when I ripped him a new one every time he even mentioned what was on our plates. It felt GOOD to release all that anger. In my opinion, keep speaking up as long as it takes to drill it into his sexist brain. NTA.", "NTA, definitely. I don't know how \"skinny\" your dad wants you to be but that is indeed unhealthy and your comment was something he needed to hear, imo. If you're gonna apologize, please let hem know (and your mother because somehow she agrees with him???) your frustration about his comments because they are hurtful and so not necessary!! \nI had to have surgery to get to 60kg because I was overweight but my parents never made me feel awful about it.", "NTA\n\nAnd I say this as a mum myself\u2026..WTAF is wrong with BOTH of your parents?!", "Good for you! You weren\u2019t mean, your dad was. He finally got a reality check on his bad behaviour as a parent. He\u2019s the AH! Always fight your corner! There\u2019s no space for body shaming.   Glad your sister is in your corner! Good luck!", "NTA\n\nI legit want to ask your mom why she's on the side of a bully.

He needed to hear it.", "NTA - I'm not a dad, but when I think about what kind of a dad I'd like to be one day, and what I'd not like to be like. Almost every woman and many men I've met in my life have a really difficult relationship with their bodies, and stuff like this is the root of much of that.\nSo it's really really irresponsible to make comments like that. Good on you for recognising that and speaking up for yourself!", "Definitely NTA. I would have gotten further as to not speak to him again and straight up ignore him every time he would mention your weight.\n\nI went through something similar cuz my dad sometimes would mention I was starting to get a belly (I'm also 60KG but I'm 1,75M) and it annoyed the shit out of me cuz it was obvious that it was after I've had a meal and was still full. Now I simply smile and say \"I know~ I love my lil belly\" every time he says something about it", "You didn't go far enough as far as I'm concerned.", "NTA. Seems like your dad is shit at parenting and banter. Tell him that he's invited to your next tea party and to wear his favourite dress.", "NTA, but your father and mother are. You're losing weight because you're sick, and instead of being worried your father said that? And he thinks it's ok? Nope, there's something wrong with him. \n\nGood for you for standing up for yourself, OP.

I've got a real bone to pick with ~~parents~~ adults who ~~their kids~~ bully young people.", "NTA\n\nYou didn't go too far at all. Your father is *celebrating that you are sick*, I celebrate that you stood up for yourself when your mother failed to have your back.\n\nThey are the adults in this situation and refuse to act like it. \n\nIf he was worried about *you* first off he wouldn't celebrate you being sick but worry for your health, he would help you with a healthier diet and overall wouldn't just be concerned about what amount of boys you will bring home (wtf)... \n\nI can be pity - that being said instead of apologizing personally I'd even top it off by adding that if he wants you to resent him in the future for causing an ED he can continue with his path, but if he genuinely would worry about your *health* he would change his behaviour towards you. But that's not an advice at all, more so what I would be doing in that situation. I just don't like when parents act that way.", "NTA\n\nHe's either having a bit of banter but by giving it back to him he knows you're not finding it funny.", "NTA\n\nAnd your father needs to be re-educated. He has an entrenched and unhealthy attitude towards women's appearance and how they're worth more if they weigh less.\n\nIt's not uncommon but it doesn't make it right", "NTA, i wouldn't apologize if i were you.", "NTA. Lend your Mum some backbone, she clearly needs it.", "NTA. You are a young person, still learning to self-regulate. In general, yelling isn\u2019t a good way to communicate. Maybe print out or send him some articles about how dangerous parental emphasis on weight/appearance can be, and how fathers can damage their daughters by acting like misogynistic pigs. Well, you know what I mean.", "Your father is verbally abusive (and that comment about attracting more boys is alarming honestly you're a child ffs) and your mom is an enabler.", "NTA. Your dad sounds gross.", "NTA glad it hurt feelings. You told him the t it's and you have nothing to apologize for. He was happy about his daughter's image while you were sick.

I\u2019m only 17 and still look back at photos of me from all ages and wonder how I felt the way I did about my body then. I remember feeling \u2018too fat\u2019 to wear a skirt at 9, and looking back I was a normal weight for a child. Nowhere near overweight. I was miserable in middle school because I always thought I was too big, and looking at those photos that are only a few years old, I feel ridiculous for thinking that way, because I wasn\u2019t at all.\n\nAnd he\u2019s absolutely a failure of a parent if he\u2019d be happy about his daughter being so ill she\u2019s lost weight. He should be concerned, and your mother should be pissed at him too.", "First of all, NTA, your dad is, and kinda your mom, I'd say your screaming is a little bad, but considering your age and what I've seen, you've restrained yourself plenty, good for you.\n\nSecond off, the whole your body your choice, you shouldn't gain or lose weight for the sake of boys and so on and so forth, I bet you heard those,\n\nThe third point, and the one I wanted to talk about, is, the whole weight and skinny/chubby thing is definitely a culture thing, which makes it even more ridiculous than if it was an international standards, \nI'm 24, 152cm, and, (discovered the day before last) I'm 46.8 (my normal weight range goes between 48 to 52, so this was kinda weird and might be worrying if it continues decreasing), and supposedly I'm skinny (not true, at least for me) and everyone say I'm overly skinny, and here is the conundrum, comparably, in my country/culture, I'm skinny, in the culture that I follow the most, I'm normal range and maybe a little chubby in the thighs, and with that discovery, it made me realize that society really invades the mind even if you do your best to avoid all stereotypicals, \n\nSo, Consequently, what helps keep the mind at ease, and puts your health in the forefront, is keeping within your Healthy BMI Range, which I'm pretty sure being 60 kg at your age and height is considered good.\n\nAnd maybe don't wait till your feelings boil over to talk so you'd have to apologize later, try to be straightforward and not curb and bury everything till it just bubbles out in the heat of the moment.", "He is an asshole for makin the comments but that weight is to high for that lengt unless you workout alot and its muscles. \nDefentily look after yourself.", "I wouldn't apologize.  And if you do, prolly to keep the peace, do so on yhe condition that he stops referring to your weight. \nJust use a simple, small 'stop' next time he does say something.

This idea people have that parents can speak to you any way they want just because they're parents needs to end. Just sitting silently and allowing someone to insult you is not respect, you do not owe anyone that and no one should expect that from you.

Your *dad* can't do that for his teenaged daughter. I wouldn't apologize without making it known that it *does* make you a terrible parent to find joy in your kids suffering just because \"it's helping you lose weight\".
