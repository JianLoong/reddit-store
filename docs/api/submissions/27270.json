I am sure if I was planning to bake something and bought yeast, I would come home to find him completely distended and surrounded in empty yeast packets. I usually stick to the same grocery list every week, and I feel like if I buy something out of the ordinary that is clearly an ingredient for a larger meal, he could at least ask before devouring it. Last night, I bought two baguettes, which I have only every purchased to make French bread pizza for him and our kids. I bought these at 11pm, and they were not even here twelve hours when I saw them on the counter, with the first six inches ripped off of each loaf, scanned the house, and saw my husband chewing. If it had been one loaf, okay. If he had used a knife, maybe. But the fact that he didn\u2019t ask if they were going to be for dinner and then ripped the top off of both of them like that final boss bloater in The Last of Us that lumbers out of the hole and rips the guy\u2019s head off, this is unforgivable. He insists I should tell him when I buy things if they are for a specific purpose. I say I am already taking on the burden of grocery shopping and cooking and the least he can do is ask. Am I the asshole here?\n\nEdit: Some pertinent information:\n1) We have two snack cabinets that he is free to snack from, not to mention whatever\u2019s in the fridge.\n2) The bread was in a cabinet that is mostly ingredients.\n3) There was regular sandwich bread for the taking that was unharmed.\n4) For those who have stated that this is raccoon-like behavior, it really does feel like I am running a wildlife rehab operation, but the only patient is a 37 year-old software programmer.\n5) To the dude who said that my husband is going to \u201cleave me for another woman who will give him peace,\u201d tell me you\u2019re still bitter about how things ended with Sheila without telling me you\u2019re still bitter about how things ended with Sheila.", "created_utc": 1695229709, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16nqnyd/aita_for_yelling_at_my_husband_over_bread/", "score": 592, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

May I suggest that whenever he does this you simply refuse to cook unless he goes to the store and replaces what he ate.  Also, hang a sign in the kitchen, \"All food in this kitchen is for a specific purpose. Ask before mindlessly devouring.\"\n\nHe won't stop until he realizes the problems his actions are causing you.  You have to make this his problem.", "NTA. OP shouldn't have to label every food item that comes into the house. Especially since this is a pattern, the husband should learn to ask first. It's not hard to say, \"Hey, are you saving these baguettes for something? Because if you're not, I want to tear six inches off each one and leave the mangled remains on the counter.\"", "NTA, he's doing it on purpose. He resents that you are expecting him to NOT have free access over every single piece of food that comes into your house, and he's making a point to eat anything he sees that you obviously have plans for. It's selfish behavior. \n\nIt's either that, or he's insufferably stupid. \"He can't read her mind!\" but he shouldn't HAVE to, it should be obvious that if something is there that isn't normally there, you ASK why it was bought before you rip into it like an animal. \n\nSo. Either he's too stupid to understand that not all food belongs to him, or he's doing it for control. And I'm leaning towards the control. He even made sure to tear up BOTH loaves, so there wasn't even one intact loaf to use! That was on purpose!", "NTA. Just because he ate off of both loaves before finishing the first one. Who the heck does that?", "NTA. Anyone who struggles to understand what are routine groceries and what are special groceries through the context of living with someone 24/7 is socially maladjusted. You shouldn't have to spell it out each time.\n\nAnd who rips the top off each baguette rather than just has one baguette to themselves? Sounds like someone with zero social awareness tbh.", "He ate pieces of \\*different\\* loaves. Either he has failed basic comprehension of food safety and storing, or he is intentionally eating things you bring for dinner. You also said it was in the \"do-not snack\" area. Consider a divorce before it becomes your keys, your wallet, etc. NTA, but your husband loves being one.", "> I am sure if I was planning to bake something and bought yeast, I would come home to find him completely distended and surrounded in empty yeast packets. \n\nNTA because that's the funniest sentence I've read in a while.", "Don't feed him. \n\nYour husband only understands with Consequences, not words.", ">ripped the top off of both of them like that final boss bloater in The Last of Us that lumbers out of the hole and rips the guy\u2019s head off\n\nI'm dying! NTA.", "NTA: Every time he does this make him go and buy the replacement.  If you are not the meal planner or chef you stay out of the food with out asking, that is just common sense.  Especially if it is special.  Also really with the ripping the ends off both, what were you raised in a barn?", "NTA that's not a husband that's a raccoon", "NTA.  He's behaving like a child.  In future, make him do a fair share of the cooking and/or shopping.  Sounds like he is not involved enough.", "God, he sounds annoying.", "NTA send him out to buy more so you can make dinner. Hopefully he will get tired of running to the store last minute because he can\u2019t communicate before devouring food. What was his reasoning behind eating a part of both loaves?  An alternative is telling him that was for tomorrow nights dinner, now he is in charge of planning & cooking dinner.", "He is now in charge of dinner.\n\nYou two should communicate better, OP.  However, this sounds like a recurring problem, and since you just went to the store there must have been *something* else in the house that he could eat if he were hungry.\n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nYes, there is potentially a lack of communication problem here, and there's a potential for OP to adjust behaviours going forward to further make it clear that items aren't up for grabs (a note on the item, designated spaces to put items with special intention, etc). But it's also clear that this is not a one time thing, and it's been talked about before. \n\nBut it also sounds like OP's husband has a see-food problem as well as a bit of main character syndrome. \n\nOP, if you're looking for advice, my suggestion would be that if there is enough left over for yourself and the kids, make the meal as planned, and husband gets his without the bread (aka some sauce/cheese/toppings on a plate) because he ate his portion already. That might help him realize how his actions are impacting others by making them only impact him.", "I had an ex like this, if I bought myself a drink on the way home and popped it in the fridge to chill it was immediately gone, more than once he ate my packed lunch for the next day, sometimes while I was actively cooking he would try to take all of something I'd just chopped up that was supposed to go in the dish. It was about entitlement and control and it didn't stop with food and that's why he's an ex.", "Ripped a chunk out of each bread!? He's a monster. nta.", "NTA that is definitely some passive aggressive bs.", "NTA. But since this is a habit you have spoken with him many times about I\u2019d tell him that dinner is now his responsibility. The dinner you planned and prepped for can no longer happen due to his choices so he has to fill the gap. And no not with the groceries you bought for other dinners that week.", "NTA. The fact that he desecrated BOTH loaves tells me that he was being TA on purpose. No pizza for him!", "NTA\n\nMy dad used to do this as well. Drove my mom and I batty. And you could never trust him to replace it, even when he said he would. He'd forget or get the totally wrong thing. While it was an annoyance now that he is gone I sometimes miss it.", "i thank you for the imagery, what a refreshing post", "I am sure if I was planning to bake something and bought yeast, I would come home to find him completely distended and surrounded in empty yeast packets.\n\n\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "NTA.\n\nI hope you then made French bread pizza for yourself and the kids, and none for him, since he'd already eaten his share of the French bread.\n\nThis isn't stoopiditity \"oo, baguette, me eat now\", because that would have just eaten one baguette. Ripping hell out of both baguettes is territory-marking \"I control every food item that comes into the house and don't you forget it\".\n\nI'd suggest putting a lock on the fridge and food cupboard.", "NTA, he should ask if it's intended for something in particular, or just household snack food. Id go ahead and make the pizza  *for myself*, and let him scrounge something else for himself, because he ate the dinner you planned for him already.", "NTA and I agree with another comment say that if he eats without asking you won\u2019t cook dinner and follow through until he realises that it\u2019s not all about him. He\u2019s not 12. Maybe say I\u2019m buying \u2018something\u2019 for dinner when doing a shop if you really think it\u2019ll help but honestly he didn\u2019t need to halve two baguettes - if it was truly an honest mistake he\u2019d of just used one to munch on or make a sandwich. I think he\u2019s doing this on purpose - I just wonder why", "NTA, this enrages me.", "NTA. He clearly knows what he\u2019s doing. Even if the bread had been for snacking not dinner, ripping the top off both loaves is beyond inconsiderate.", "This is NTA instead of NAH for me because he ripped off both baguettes! Who does that? It seems subconsciously intentional. Like why would you eat off both?", "Um, bread.... you are in a mind blowing argument over bread.  Maybe he should start helping with the shopping and the cooking so he understands why you're so frustrated.   NTA.", "NTA for your own sanity I would probably label stuff, but you shouldn't have to do that.  Maybe he should be put in charge of grocery shopping for a while.", "NTA, does he not know how to cook?", "NTA.  My husband does this too, specifically with potato chips.  Sometimes I'll plan to have hot dogs on the grill or sandwiches for dinner if we have something going on, and I can prep all the stuff like 3 days after I bought them, and they'll be all gone.  He'll eat the whole bag in one sitting.  It's unbelievable.", "NTA\nI hope you aren't silly enough to cook for him after he eats thw ingredients. Set down the food for yourself and the kids, even if you have to make something different, and tell him he ate his portion already! That would drive me nuts.", "Make the pizza tonight, serve him just the toppings since he already ate his bread.", "Is your husband a child? Took half from both instead of a whole one at least?", "NTA\n\nWhy do people do weird dominance shit like this with their partners. Why can't people be normal and respect their partners and participate as equals instead of acting like incompetent toddlers?", "Lol NTA!\n\nThe biggest fight my husband and I have ever had was over 3 Oreos. We had our own packages of them, mine being in the fridge. He went through his whole package, then proceeded to make his way through mine. Normally I don't mind. That day I did. He left me three. I always eat 4 in a sitting. It was the only time I've raised my voice in his direction.", "NTA and you\u2019re a fantastic storyteller! If something out of the ordinary appears in the house, he needs to ask about it before putting his mitts on it!", "This is why so many women are getting divorces lol\n\nIm sorry, but this made me laugh so much, the way you wrote it.\n\nI feel your pain, lol", "NTA.  Lawyer up.", "Maybe e s h in general but NTA for the specific baguette incident.  Who tears the tips off 2 separate baguettes?  It\u2019s incredibly selfish. Sort of like taking a bite out of each slice of pizza and leaving the rest for others. \n\nIn general you need to have a system like stickers or a specific place you put stuff he can\u2019t have.", "Nta. It takes 2 seconds to check. Sounds selfish af.", "Treating those baguettes that way is the equivalent of biting into a Kit Kat without breaking it into sticks first, or like eating a string cheese without peeling it. NTA", "NTA & I feel you! I finally made a snack shelf and a rule. If it is on the snack shelf, eat it, please, for the love of all that is holy get it in your belly and out of my house. If it is not on the snack shelf, whoever eats it is cooking for the week, doing the shopping and planning too, and might still face the wrath of side eye as I tell the dog nasty things about them in a judgmental tone. If one wants something not on the snack shelf as a snack then we use our words and over communicate. If he needs to have all of his socks mismatched for the rest of the year as penance for the baguette beheading I think that is justified.", "NTA. \n\nSeriously, one doesn\u2019t need to explicitly label or talk about every single thing bought for the house. \n\nHe should be asking.\n\nI\u2019m going to assume that most people run things like our house (large family here, so maybe we are less basic than I think). \n\nThere are always a pile of things - the same things\u2014 that are open season. Like cut up veggies, fruit, crackers, sliced white bread, tortillas, milk, ice cream, yogurt. Popsicles\n\nIf a child or adult runs across one avocado, they think \u201c hmm, I bet it it for something specific\u201d. If they find 10 avocados, they are pretty certain we are hosting something or providing a meal somewhere and Don\u2019t Take My Ingredients! Or at least ask. \n\nBakery bread is ALWAYS for something (unless I bought it on the 25 cent rack). Usually either garlic bread or meatball subs.  Which everyone ducking loves, and if the bread gets eaten, the backup meal is like quesadillas or grilled cheese. Which is also yummy but is a frequent lunchtime thing, not really wanted for dinner. \n\nChocolate chips, marshmallows, etc\u2026it only took a couple time of those being\u201dmissing\u201d to find out there is no dessert for anyone.   So sad. And the food muncher in most definitely shamed into asking before swiping by the younger family members in the house.", "Op, your husband is a greedy inconsiderate AH! His behaviour is childish, surely he can wait for you to make the food before he decides to mutilate your bread! He must realise that you were planning to use it for something and could have just asked.  Clearly this is not the first time this is happening, you need to talk to him upfront and tell him why his behaviour is annoying.  \n\n 'like that final boss bloater in The Last of Us that lumbers out of the hole and rips the guy\u2019s head off, this is unforgivable.'

He told me I was \"too controlling\".", "NTA. \n\nAny time he eats something that impacts dinner, exclude him from dinner or absolve yourself of the responsibility altogether. \n\nSorry, kids. Dad devoured the ingredients needed so he's on the hook for dinner.", "NTA make him go buy two new loaves and serve peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for dinner. Tell your kids how dad ate the ingredients for dinner again. Seriously though I think the real solution is to have your husband do the meal planning and shopping for a month.

Because if so it's OK.", "I\u2019m sorry, did you say he ate yeast packets..?", "NTA, because why would he need to eat pieces of both baguettes? That was a pretty hostile thing to do. \n\nE S H, overall, because you know by now that you need a better system to indicate when you buy food for meals as opposed to snacks. Designate a shelf that is open snacking, and go on from there. \n\nAnytime he eats recipe ingredients that aren't on the designated shelf, he gets to immediately go buy more, using his allowance to pay for it.", "INFO\n\nDo you communicate to him \"Please don't eat this - I have plans for it\"?  Or do you just put it in the kitchen with the *assumption* he won't eat it?", "[deleted]", "ESH, your hubby is a bit of a jerk, and you're being childish by not just talking to him.

My god", "NTA lol, he\u2019s being pretty inconsiderate but maybe he\u2019s bored by you buying pretty much the same stuff every week. Maybe mix it up some? It\u2019s easy to get in a rut with the grocery shopping and cooking, I\u2019m a housewife so I get it. Men are like big kids lol, but for the future they make these lock boxes for kitchen stuff I think that would be a funny way to get your message across. Give him a hug, it\u2019s so easy to get frustrated with eachother after so long over small stuff.", "wait did he eat dry yeast??\n\nDoes he have a disordered relationship with food? Maybe he needs to see a therapist if he's eating non-edible stuff like raw yeast.", "I'm gonna go with NAH.\n\nThis sounds like you both have different family backgrounds with different home cultures. He probably existed in a house where what was in the pantry was what there was to eat.\n\nIt seems like your understanding of a pantry is a lot more organized and stringent. We have our regular items, and then the meals are planned, and any special items will be bought and allocated to that purpose.\n\nAll that being said, if you're feeling unfairly burdened or unappreciated, that's a different conversation. Both of you should be trying to understand each other and meet each other's needs.", "ESH but NTA for the bread incident. I'm sure this has been building in you awhile. A possible solution going forward is to have a space in your kitchen that is free to whatever purpose. Have your list handy so he can add to it if he wants something specific, everything else, he needs to agree to leave alone unless he has checked to see if it's needed for a meal plan. Some communication from everyone could solve this.", "ESH \n\nHe's wrong for just tearing into whatever, but also you are assuming he's just going to know what is off limits. \n\nPerhaps just put a sticky note or something on stuff you are saving for a specific meal.

I am sure if I was planning to bake something and bought yeast, I would come home to find him completely distended and surrounded in empty yeast packets. I usually stick to the same grocery list every week, and I feel like if I buy something out of the ordinary that is clearly an ingredient for a larger meal, he could at least ask before devouring it. Last night, I bought two baguettes, which I have only every purchased to make French bread pizza for him and our kids. I bought these at 11pm, and they were not even here twelve hours when I saw them on the counter, with the first six inches ripped off of each loaf, scanned the house, and saw my husband chewing. If it had been one loaf, okay. If he had used a knife, maybe. But the fact that he didn\u2019t ask if they were going to be for dinner and then ripped the top off of both of them like that final boss bloater in The Last of Us that lumbers out of the hole and rips the guy\u2019s head off, this is unforgivable. He insists I should tell him when I buy things if they are for a specific purpose. I say I am already taking on the burden of grocery shopping and cooking and the least he can do is ask.

It is perfectly legit to except him to ask first.", "NTA, sounds like you need a system. Food on X shelf in pantry and fridge is for snacking, everything else is planned as part of a meal. Or vice versa (dedicated shelf for ingredients). This is pretty self-centered behavior from your husband as everyone who's lived in a household that meal plans should know.
