We are civil and try to help each other when we can. \n\nA few days ago, ex asked if I could watch one of the kids (10) so that she and other kid (8) could go to a birthday dinner. Kid was sick, that\u2019s why they couldn\u2019t go. I said ok. Went and got kid and they were really sick. She picked him up after the dinner and they didn\u2019t go to school the next day. \n\nYesterday, I woke up sick with same stuff. My wife is upset with me because she says we shouldn\u2019t have kept the kid when sick. They should have stayed at home, even though my ex wouldn\u2019t have been able to go to the dinner. \n\nHer reasoning is that she has a job where she doesn\u2019t get paid unless she works and is worried she will get sick too and she has a chronic illness which makes her more prone to getting sick and illnesses are harder on her than others. \n\nBut it\u2019s my kid and if I need to keep him, I need to keep him. This is what parents do. \n\nSo Reddit AITA??\n\nUpdate: wife didn\u2019t expect kid to stay home alone sick, she says ex should have stayed home with sick kid. Wife did avoid kid and disinfected everything and I still got sick. If I get sick, she usually does too. Wife has kids too and if hers are sick they stay with her ex. She says since it wasn\u2019t an emergency like for ex to work or something that they should have stayed there. Like it wasn\u2019t worth the risk. I love my wife and just want to know the right thing to do.\n\n2 Update: some clarifications - my current wife has an autoimmune disease and has had complications from normal sickness in the past that has put her in the hospital. That happened once. \nthe birthday dinner was for one of my ex\u2019s friends, not the ok kid.

I'm sure Co-parenting is difficult enough when you are acting as a team, let alone if you add resentments in the mix.

And figure out a plan to reduce exposure to your current partner if you (or anyone in your home) do get sick, masks, alternate sleeping arrangements, ventilation, etc. We can get exposed to illnesses in lots of ways and looking after your kids (emergency or not) is a completely understandable, noble and recurring situation.
