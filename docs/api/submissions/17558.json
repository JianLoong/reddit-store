We are civil and try to help each other when we can. \n\nA few days ago, ex asked if I could watch one of the kids (10) so that she and other kid (8) could go to a birthday dinner. Kid was sick, that\u2019s why they couldn\u2019t go. I said ok. Went and got kid and they were really sick. She picked him up after the dinner and they didn\u2019t go to school the next day. \n\nYesterday, I woke up sick with same stuff. My wife is upset with me because she says we shouldn\u2019t have kept the kid when sick. They should have stayed at home, even though my ex wouldn\u2019t have been able to go to the dinner. \n\nHer reasoning is that she has a job where she doesn\u2019t get paid unless she works and is worried she will get sick too and she has a chronic illness which makes her more prone to getting sick and illnesses are harder on her than others. \n\nBut it\u2019s my kid and if I need to keep him, I need to keep him. This is what parents do. \n\nSo Reddit AITA??\n\nUpdate: wife didn\u2019t expect kid to stay home alone sick, she says ex should have stayed home with sick kid. Wife did avoid kid and disinfected everything and I still got sick. If I get sick, she usually does too. Wife has kids too and if hers are sick they stay with her ex. She says since it wasn\u2019t an emergency like for ex to work or something that they should have stayed there. Like it wasn\u2019t worth the risk. I love my wife and just want to know the right thing to do.\n\n2 Update: some clarifications - my current wife has an autoimmune disease and has had complications from normal sickness in the past that has put her in the hospital.

Your wife is right that your ex and other kid should have skipped the birthday party rather than expose her (and potentially all the other people at the birthday party) to a contagious illness. You\u2019re also an AH for describing your wife as dramatic over this when she\u2019s immunocompromised and has been hospitalized in the past.

It should be a shared partnership. Fun fact, in my area, you had to complete a parenting class when custody was ordered. The class actually said that parents should still exchange the child when the child is sick. Now, obviously, if the child is VERY sick that\u2019s different. This was validating for me as my daughter\u2019s father wouldn\u2019t take her if she so much had the sniffles. I\u2019d also like to add that this was years before Covid so things may have changed. However, I change my mind to YTA as your wife has an autoimmune disorder. Now, her disorder shouldn\u2019t ever prevent you from your parental obligations. But this wasn\u2019t necessarily a need.

That poor kid had to be so uncomfortable SMH", ">And when she gets sick she has had to go to hospital before. She isn\u2019t usually dramatic about it.\n\nShe isn't \"dramatic\" about it cuz she's probably dealt with it long enough that she's numb to the process. But you need to pull it together and stop taking her level-headedness and calm as unofficial approval to dismiss your wife's health and treat it as a minor issue.\n\nAsk yourself this OP, if your wife ends up in the hospital and dies, how will you feel then about the fact that you risked her life for a birthday party?", "So I think it's fair you should step up and watch your sick kid, even if it's not an 'emergency'. I'm sure Co-parenting is difficult enough when you are acting as a team, let alone if you add resentments in the mix.

And figure out a plan to reduce exposure to your current partner if you (or anyone in your home) do get sick, masks, alternate sleeping arrangements, ventilation, etc. We can get exposed to illnesses in lots of ways and looking after your kids (emergency or not) is a completely understandable, noble and recurring situation. But unless you are putting consideration into actions you can take to not let your partner get sick then YTA.", "A good rule of thumb to remember is that you don't exchange kids during sickness. If a kid gets sick at 1 parents, they ride out the illness there until nobody in that house is sick again. General rule of quarantining, you don't add more people into the loop.
