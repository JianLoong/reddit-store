We are civil and try to help each other when we can. \n\nA few days ago, ex asked if I could watch one of the kids (10) so that she and other kid (8) could go to a birthday dinner. Kid was sick, that\u2019s why they couldn\u2019t go. I said ok. Went and got kid and they were really sick. She picked him up after the dinner and they didn\u2019t go to school the next day. \n\nYesterday, I woke up sick with same stuff. My wife is upset with me because she says we shouldn\u2019t have kept the kid when sick. They should have stayed at home, even though my ex wouldn\u2019t have been able to go to the dinner. \n\nHer reasoning is that she has a job where she doesn\u2019t get paid unless she works and is worried she will get sick too and she has a chronic illness which makes her more prone to getting sick and illnesses are harder on her than others. \n\nBut it\u2019s my kid and if I need to keep him, I need to keep him. This is what parents do. \n\nSo Reddit AITA??\n\nUpdate: wife didn\u2019t expect kid to stay home alone sick, she says ex should have stayed home with sick kid. Wife did avoid kid and disinfected everything and I still got sick. If I get sick, she usually does too. Wife has kids too and if hers are sick starting at our house she keeps them and takes care of them but if they start sick over there they stay with her ex. She says since it wasn\u2019t an emergency like for ex to work or something that they should have stayed there. Like it wasn\u2019t worth the risk. I love my wife and just want to know the right thing to do.\n\n2 Update: some clarifications - my current wife has an autoimmune disease and has had complications from normal sickness in the past that has put her in the hospital. That happened once. \nthe birthday dinner was for one of my ex\u2019s friends, not the ok kid.

I'm sure Co-parenting is difficult enough when you are acting as a team, let alone if you add resentments in the mix.

And figure out a plan to reduce exposure to your current partner if you (or anyone in your home) do get sick, masks, alternate sleeping arrangements, ventilation, etc. We can get exposed to illnesses in lots of ways and looking after your kids (emergency or not) is a completely understandable, noble and recurring situation.

And most of all you should have ofc known better than to maybe compromise her, hope she doesnt catch death.", "did you take any real precautions to prevent your wife from getting sick? did you make your sick child wear an N95 mask at home? are you wearing one now? \n\nare you distancing from her within your house? sleeping in a separate room? not eating in shared spaces? \n\nyou say you think the risk of your wife getting so ill she's hospitalised is low.... how low? like come on dude, you're playing Russian roulette and trying to justify it by saying the odds are on your side. okay so if that's the case, what odds are worth playing?\n\nan ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, and that's a million times more true for people who are already disabled\n\nyou gambled your wife's life. yes I understand that sounds dramatic to you, but that's what you did. you don't fuck around with auto immune conditions. okay so she's only needed to be hospitalised once. are you *trying* to increase that number? are you *trying* to increase the risk of permanent complications? are you *trying* to increase the risk of death? the goal for your wife's health is to avoid getting sick whenever humanely possible and avoid hospitalisations and complications and even if she does an amazing job at that, she's living with a condition that can seriously lower her life expectancy and that puts her at serious risk for further complications\n\nand all of this wasn't for an emergency or even for work, it was so that your very likely contagious ex could go out to dinner and potentially infect many more people! \n\nhow are you any different than the people who get COVID and go out to eat anyway? except oh yeah, the person whose life you're needlessly endangering is *your own wife's*", "Exactly. I was thinking if this was so contagious, the ex and other kid shouldn't have been going out anyway.", "So do 43 year olds!!", "Yeah, OP and his ex definitely both suck here. I\u2019m just curious for more insight into his thought process. Or was there even one? \n\nIt\u2019s just interesting how all he says is, \u201cKid was sick, that\u2019s why they couldn\u2019t go. I said ok.\u201d Is he glossing over his considerations into his decision because he now realizes his mistake? Or was that literally all the thought he afforded to the situation?", "Oh i want to know how corona went with your attitude. YTA", "INFO Did you tell your wife beforehand? Or as soon as you found out? If you told her and she didn't object it's her fault, but you do need to communicate.", "Wow. YTA. And have learned nothing from over 1 million passed.", "I\u2019m sorry", "Yes and I\u2019m sorry", "Oh sorry then\n\nI thought it wasn\u2019t major\n\nMy apologies", "I know now\n\nSorry", "Some other redditor told me it was serious so I didn\u2019t really know but that doesn\u2019t give you the right to consider me below human beings\n\nYOU are one of the reasons why killers exist\n\nWhat if I took this to heart and inflicted pain on others? This is the exact reason why killers are born\n\nNot because nobody helped them but because people insulted them in a way that crushed their hearts\n\nI apologize for what I said but you equally if not worse then me", "I apologize another redditor explained to me the harm of the wife\u2019s condition\n\nI\u2019m sorry", "Yeah, but as you can read in the post, her case is severe like mine and you don't even know what her condition and medications are.", "You\u2019re gonna have a tough time on Reddit, kid.", "I've actually wanted to try that but for some reason I haven't dared to (no idea why). But it's definitely on the list!\n\nI'm also lucky to hardly come across those types I think. The most outspoken one was in a supermarket a couple months back. He didn't say anything directly to me, but the coward loudly complained about \"scared people still wearing masks\". Unfortunately he had too small kids with him (poor kids) and I was out with my wheelchair so I was a bit scared for myself and the kids to go for a confrontation. \n\nMostly it's taxi drivers (I use a disabled taxi service, which makes this so much worse) who make comments or ask about it rudely. I usually give one of my many reasons, ranging from \"I have previously healthy friends who can do less than I can now\" or \"Everyone with my specific illness who had it came of worse\", or something like it. This in a very sharp tone and it shuts m right off.", "YTA \n\nAs someone with an immunocompromised immune system who falls sick every couple of months with the most random illnesses. You don\u2019t do that. \n\nI can tell you from experience being immunocompromised sucks, you don\u2019t know when/where or how you\u2019re gonna get sick. All you know is you will, and the severity is usually higher than normal for our sicknesses. \n\nFor example while wearing a mask I got locked inside a full metro for 10 minutes. Next day I had ringing in my ears and vertigo, 2 days later I got diagnosed with vastibular neuritis. That took me out for 2 weeks, I couldn\u2019t raise my head from my pillow without instantly becoming dizzy again. \n\nIf you\u2019re living with someone immunocompromised and who has an autoimmune disease you have to do whatever you can to accommodate that person. Because what you think of as simple illnesses could be their downfall. OP you shouldn\u2019t have taken your sick kid, he should\u2019ve stayed at home with his mom. \n\nYou\u2019ve know put your gf at great risk for a dinner. Hope you\u2019re proud of yourself.", "As someone with an autoimmune disease, I kinda have to side with your wife. I\u2019m sure you know sicknesses can hit us hard. But you\u2019re NTA for looking after your kid. It\u2019s a catch 22 situation here and nobody wins sadly", "Coming from someone whose brother has Cystic Fibrosis (a lung disease where a normal illness can become serious or fatal) YTA. Seems like you're putting your ex's wishes over your wife's needs/safety/wishes. And it wasn't even your kid's birthday dinner? If my brother were in this situation I would be mad so I'm mad for your wife. But, this really hits home for me. Maybe you don't quite understand your wife's autoimmune disease to the extent that you should or if you do, you're showing that you're not taking it seriously. All I have to say is, do better friend. You better grovel because she was probably scared of getting sick and for someone like her you know getting sick is a big deal.", "I\u2019m torn here. I have an autoimmune condition as well. But you are a father. I\u2019d say it\u2019s complicated and I\u2019m going with the wife is an asshole. I mean she knew she married a man with kids.", "Someone i know got sick. And get with us, later with other people to. To much people got really sick  include me. I'm not immuncompromised but it felt so bad. It was so annoying because it was easily avoideble. Like this. Her illnes makes is worse ofcourse. But just don't get other people sick", "Tell that to my ex husband.", "It\u2019s the same here. Every-time I weak a mask or use hand sanitiser people give me weird looks. And I\u2019ve been told before \u2018COVID\u2019s over\u2019"]}
