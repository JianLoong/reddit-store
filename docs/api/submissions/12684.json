His name is Apollo and I (26F) adopted him from the humane society at 3 years old in 2018, with my ex husband. Fast forward to August 2021, I finally leave my ex husband in Kansas and move back to Texas. From this marriage we had to split our pets. I took my cat Apollo, and my dog Nyx. During the transition I started dating my current boyfriend 28M. \n\nApollo is now 8 years old and I\u2019m living in my own apartment with him and my dog. I really love my cat. My boyfriend and have have now been dating for over a year and have been talking about getting engaged and moving in together. When my boyfriend comes over he complains about headaches and blames them on the cat. He states that allergy medications don\u2019t help and that he shouldn\u2019t have to rely on them on a daily basis to live in his own house. He does not want to take allergy shots. I have made several adjustments to try to accommodate for his allergy, but he says nothing helps. This includes keeping Apollo out of the bedroom, two air purifiers in my 770 sq ft space, wiping Apollo down with an anti allergy solution, and vacuuming multiple times a week. He said nothing helped his headache. Mind you, he complains of no other symptoms. He has allergies in general I believe, because he taken Claritin since started dating.\n\nHe dotes all over my dog but clearly hates my cat. He has stated he wants me to rehome him to one of his friends so at least I can \u201cstill see him\u201d. Despite this one thing, we get get along great, our values are aligned, and I can truly see a bright future together. I truly love my Apollo. He is such a laid back little guy and is super loving. I just don\u2019t think I can rehome him, but at the same time I don\u2019t want to break up with my boyfriend. \n\nWhen I told my boyfriend this, he couldn\u2019t believe I would pick a cat over the relationship. AITA for asking him to let me keep my cat despite his allergy?", "created_utc": 1679243413, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11vps7k/aita_for_wanting_to_keep_my_cat_even_though_my/", "score": 307, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

NTA. Keep him ditch the guy", "NTA you've had the cat for 5 years and only have been with this guy for one year. Put that into perspective..and if keeping the cat is a break or make for the relationship, it was never strong to being with and not worth rehoming your cat.", "NTA. Pets that were with you before any new partners are entitled to stay with you more than anyone else. Getting rid of a pet because a selfish person comes in later, for any reason, would make you TA. Anyone that even so much as utters a thought along the lines of \"it's the pet or me\" clearly doesn't respect you or your existing bonds enough to be a keeper. That's a textbook red flag. This is a slope that is going to steepen dramatically as soon as you try to take the first step. If he has allergies this bad to basic and common household pets, it's his fault for not bringing it up far earlier into the conversation before your relationship progressed this far.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have so many allergies I'm basically allergic to the planet itself. If I'm allergic to something and I'm noticing a reaction, I'll get away from it. Your boyfriend needs to make that decision. He may not even be telling the truth about having an allergy and may just be trying to convince you to get rid of the cat because he just doesn't like cats, or wants to make himself the only family member for more control, or something else.", "NTA , Apollo predates the BF, cat gets to stay. BF knew he had an allergy, he doesn't get to dictate what anyone else does with their pets just because he failed to plan ahead.", "\"He dotes all over my dog but clearly hates my cat. He has stated he wants me to rehome him to one of his friends so at least I can \u201cstill see him\u201d. Despite this one thing, we  get along great, our values are aligned\"\n\n\nBut they aren't. It isn't just one thing. It's a big thing. He wants you to rehome your pet that you love and he's refusing any sort of real compromise. And from what you've described, he's trying to back you into a corner. Behaviors like that won't be isolated to one thing. Not telling you to break up. Just adding a perspective. He isn't even thinking about how that cat and dog are a part of your new life after your divorce. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. His immediate reaction was that you're picking your cat over your relationship? Well, he's picking not trying to find meds that work over your relationship, now what? First of all he should check if he's really for sure allergic to cats because right now who knows? Maybe he's wrong about that.", "NTA\n\nYou made a commitment to that cat when you adopted him. Animals aren't just toys to be given away when they become inconvenient.\n\nYour boyfriend could get allergy shots but chooses not to. The shots would probably help him; my best friend is allergic to cats but gets the shots and has an ex-feral living with her now. \n\nHe could try different medications. Not everything works for everyone. \n\nLong story short, cat was there first and it's not fair to dispose of him due to him being inconvenient. I don't know what your solution is but in your shoes I wouldn't give up my companion for someone I've known for less time.", "NTA. He knew about your cat early on and still chose to pursue a relationship. Its unlikely that allergies come as headaches exclusively. Headaches are usually a result of sinus pressure  issues. Typically there are breathing issues, runny nose, itchy eyes and throat as well. I'd be willing to bet he just doesn't like cats. If he's unwilling to try different meds or shots he's the problem, not your cat.", "NTA. Your relationship with your cat pre-dates this boyfriend. It's unfair of him to ask you to rehome a cat you love. And it sounds like you've tried everything to accomodate your boyfriend. Is your boyfriend giving you an ultimatum? The fact that he can't understand your perspective is worrying.", "Also, I have a litter robot that gets changed every couple of days because I don\u2019t like smelling my cat. So automatic changing that he would never have to do.", "NTA\n\nHowever if you rehome your cat for a\n1 year relationship\u2026 You will 100% be TA.\n\nWhen you adopt an animal youre making a promise to be there until the end. Your cat is already 8 years old and probably only has a few more years left. Not to mention you two have been dating for 1 year, I think you two can hold off on moving in and getting married a bit longer. Statistically you two are still in the honeymoon phase anyways! Wait to see if this even lasts past that, damn.", "Absolutely NTA, the cat was there first", "If you love your cat, then this boyfriend isn't the right man for you. You've had the cat longer than you've had him. There's plenty of time to find another boyfriend who loves BOTH your pets.\n\nSeriously. I let everyone I ever dated know that I love my pets. There will be no choosing, because \"you\" will always lose. Pets are a lifetime commitment - not \"until I start dating\" commitment \". Any guy who doesn't understand that doesn't deserve to be with us. My husband loves our cats. Just like I love his kids.\n\nSome people are just not compatible...\nNTA", "NTA\n\nthe cat was there first so the cat does have priority and is he actually allergic or just faking it? there are plenty of meds on the market for allergies, has he tried any of them? \n\nyou don't get to enter into someone else's life and then demand they give up their pets for you, that is just selfish and being an ahole, pets are not toys to be discarded whenever you feel like it, they are living beings with emotions and attachments to their humans\n\nsounds like its time to rehome the bf and be happy with the cat", "NTA, I'm willing to bet he isn't even allergic", "NTA I\u2019d pick my cat too. Also, why doesn\u2019t he try to  work in the direction of fixing it or making a compromise of some kind. As you stated, you clearly have been trying to accommodate him but he has done nothing to accommodate Apollo? He sounds really selfish by asking you to rehome him, when he hasn\u2019t even made any efforts to fix it.", "NTA\n\nAfter a certain time, pets become family. 5 years with a pet is a very long time, and you can't just give up someone you love. \n\nAlso, just to be 100% sure, have your boyfriend do an allergy test. He could take allergy shots if he actually does have an allergy. Relationships are about compromise and understanding, and he should understand that giving up your family isn't exactly easy. Taking allergy shots won't do him any harm, considering he isn't allergic the shots in itself.", "Keep the cat, let the bf find someone who hates cats as much as he does. NTA.", "NTA. Sounds to me like bf is a dog person and is trying to manipulate you to get rid of your cat.", "NTA. You love your cat, and it's normal to make him a top priority in your life.", "NTA - My partner has 3 cats that I am very allergic to, but fortunately science has created this cool new product called allergy medication. I take an over the counter one & it works great. It\u2019s totally worth it to me to be able to spend my time with my partner in our home surrounded by our ENTIRE family. If he wanted it to work he\u2019d make it work.", "NTA.\n\nYour boyfriend is the one who's the asshole here. It sounds like he's jealous of the attention you're giving little Apollo, honestly. You've put so much effort into accommodating for his alleged allergies, and yet he won't even do his part into taking care of them himself? Nope. Dump him and live happily ever after with your precious fur-baby", "NTA\n\nIm like highly allergic to a million things. Very allergic to my cats. I still love those lil fur babies though. I cant take allergy meds because of other medications im on and im in school so allergy shots are not a viable option at the moment. Just due to the back and forth from home and them being a weekly responsibility. I find that as long as I keep my cats away from my eyes/face and wash sheets/blankets regularly. Along with special nasal spray I got from my doctor its pretty well managed. I have a suspicion he may just hate cats.", "Oh no, NTA. There is some magical combination of meds out there(trust me I\u2019ve done them all). If he actually cared about you he\u2019d make it work. You don\u2019t just rehome a cat like that.\n\nAssuming he\u2019s not just faking that is.", "NTA, NTA, NTA. \n\nHe refuses to get allergy shots, he hasn't recognized the effort you put into it to make sure his allergy would lessen. \n\nImo this is controlling behavior. If you'd gotten a cat *after* you'd moved in with him knowing he was allergic, I'd say YTA. But not in this situation. \n\nPlus, his symptoms of 'allergies' don't really sound legit either. If he's only getting a headache, it could easily be something else causing them. \n\nHonestly, it's callous as hell to expect you to rehome your cat. I'm a bit allergic to cats, and I would never suggest that in a thousand years. I certainly wouldn't be shocked that you would \"pick a cat over him\" either o___o.\n\nListen, from the way you've written your post you already know that this shit isn't ok and shouldn't be tolerated. If you acquiesce to a request like this, there's no telling what other boundaries he'd be happy to cross for his own comfort.", "NTA. You made a commitment to the cat well before you ever met him. There are any number of things he could do to help this situation and he has refused. His solution is simply to ask you to make a sacrifice. Dump the guy, keep the cat.", "NTA.  Pets are literally like family members, so it's pretty upsetting to see how he's not empathetic to you about possibly rehoming your cat.  \n\nI have severe cat allergies, and I mean severe enough that being in the same room as a cat makes my throat itchy and hard to breathe.  But I adore pets, cats included, and suck it up when my friends have them.  They do their best to accommodate, and I also prepare the best I can when visiting. Honestly Ive even built a tolerance to one of them, still cant touch my face but breathing has been fine. \nIf i choose to date someone who has a cat, that's a choice I knowingly made and shouldn't expect my lover to just dump their cat for me.  If im serious about that person id take allergy shots, the whole mile if im financially able.  Your bf doesnt want to put in the effort.\n\nIf your bf dated you and the whole time he was planning on you to get rid of your cat, he's an asshole.  Also, even if you did rehome your cat and visit it, you would still bring back dander and hair flairing up his allergies.  He's either full of bs or didn't think things through, neither which are good to make a serious decision about your pet", "NTA. As someone that is also very allergic to cats, I have never even entertained the idea of a relationship with anyone that has had a cat. Not fair to me, not fair to the cat. \n\nSounds to me like this will unfortunately end up as a relationship ender. It's not fair to ask you to get rid of your cat, but if your BF is that allergic it's just not likely to work out long term.", "NTA! Rehome the boyfriend, not the cat.  Pets are a lifetime commitment.  Your boyfriend knew you had the cat, and he wants you to get rid of it for his convenience.  I'd be willing to bet he isn't actually allergic to cats, but just wants you to get rid of it because he doesn't like cats.  \n\nIt's YOUR apartment, YOUR cat that you have loved for years.  He has no right to insist you get rid of the cat, and you are NOT the AH unless you get rid of the cat.", "NTA. The cat has superiority. I'd be the same way with my own cat. She comes first.", "NTA. That cat was there for you when you needed it, and has been yours for 5 years. You tried accommodating him, if he isn\u2019t willing to try anything to compromise besides you doing what he wants, take that into consideration. If his only symptom is a headache, he probably needs to consult a doctor because that isn\u2019t a common reaction to a cat and it could be something completely different causing it too.", "NTA.  It's hard for me to think that someone who loves you would expect you to get rid of a cat you've had and loved for 8 years.  Also that would be an unusual allergy symptom.  Is he willing to get tested?  My guess is he isn't even allergic, he just doesn't want the cat and thinks his wants are more important than yours.  Also I say this as someone who is allergic to cats and lives in a household with them.", "If he knew you had a cat and still suggested/agreed moving in together then no you wouldn\u2019t the AH", "NTA, but it sounds like you're moving too fast in this relationship. you've only been together for a year, there's no rush (esp at 26 with a divorce under your belt!) to get married or move in together.", "NTA.\n\nYou love both your boyfriend and your cat. Wanting to keep both of them in your life is totally understanable and does not make you an A-hole. This is such a difficult situation to navigate and I sincerely hope you two can come up with a solution.", "Nta. Cat was around before the bf. He knew he was allergic when yall started dating. He can either take meds or kick rocks", "Keep the cat. Find a new partner who understands that animals are a long term commitment. NTA", "NTA\n\nThis sounds like more that the bf just doesn\u2019t like cats.\n\nThere is an (expensive) cat food that reduces dander in many cats.  Give it a try.  Meanwhile, if you are cleaning daily and running air filters, it is highly likely that the headache your BF gets is from something else, not the cat.", "NTA. You've been with the cat longer. Of course you should keep him.\n\nYour BF seems to think pets are accessories that can be passed on at will. You yourself say he \"hates\" the cat. Take this as a warning sign. If you did move in together I'd worry about the cat going \"missing\" or something worse.\n\nKeep the cat. Ditch the boyfriend.", "NTA but your boyfriend is. Demanding\nA person rehome their pet is gross. He can take some allergy meds. This would be a dealbreaker for me personally as a pet owner.", "NTA anyone asking me to get rid of my family will find themselves bouncing down the street with how quick and efficient I\u2019d be \u2018escorting\u2019 them out of my life.\n\nEdit a word", "NTA He's probably a cat hater looking for an excuse to convince you to rehome the cat. If he really cared about you he wouldn't be pushing you to abandon a family member and would get allergy shots.", "NTA, you're being accommodating and a good pet parent. Mr Apollo is part of you as your little family,  and the fact that your partner would want to have you abandon your fur baby is... well, gross and insensitive. \n\nIf he's not willing to go to the full length to accommodate you in the way you're doing for him, then you are already showing that you are willing to put more into the relationship than him. Stand strong! Be matter of fact about the fact that your home is Apoolos home. Besides, Apollo has done nothing but be your little love and support furball.He deserves to be in his home with his parent. Guarantee your cat loves you purely in a way your partner is showing he doesn't. \n\nPets are not a convenience that should be tossed aside when we feel like it. No one should be treated like that, and you should explain that to him. If he doesn't understand, why should he be trusted not to toss other living things aside when it suits him without regard to anyone else's feelings and respect?", "Nta. I also don't think allergies to cats give headaches so think he's inventing symptoms", "NTA\n\nApollo = 8 year relationship.  Allergic boyfriend = less than two years (over a year) relationship.  Apollo is grandfathered in.\n\nI\u2019m just curious though.  If OP\u2019s boyfriend is as allergic as he claims to be, why does he want OP to rehome Apollo to one of HIS friends?  You would think he would want OP to rehome Apollo to one of OP\u2019s friends.  You know, someone Apollo might actually know.", "NTA.\n\nIt\u2019s not picking a cat over a relationship. It\u2019s choosing not make yourself \u201csmall\u201d (and your wants small) for another person.\n\nYou have compromised\u2026which is what relationships are all about. Forcing someone to give up their pet with an ultimatum? Not so much.\n\nAre you sure this relationship is a \u201cgreat\u201d as it seems if you look at little deeper at how he treats you when you disagree?", "NTA. It's a sign of more to come.\nI'm allergic to cats and I would never consider doing this. It's a sign of who he is, I'd expect more narcissistic demands to follow. I strongly suggest not moving in with him until the NRE fades and all the orange flags start to show how red they really are.", "NTA\n\nYour boyfriend is being unreasonable. Your pets are your children, if he can't see that and make consessions, than he is the one that has to go. Do not let him wear you down. Would you send one of your children away because he didn't want to live in the same house with them? He can take allergy meds or get shots if he really wants to be with you. If he really loves you he will take you with EVERYTHING that you are, including your children!", "NTA my now fiance is allergic to almost anything furry. I have multiple cats, rats, and at the time we met 2 dogs (both have passed now and recently adopted another dog)  he knew this when he met me, knew that I also foster, and am planning to be a vet. Not ONCE has he ever suggested removing the animals. Most of then were here first, any new pets were of course a mutual decision. He'd be out the door the moment he suggested removing animals when he KNEW this is who I am and what I like.", "NTA. Your cat is a beloved pet.

I'm guessing he tried to make it work in the beginning with medications etc and it's failed and now you are at this crossroad. It's easier said then done to just dump him like most on here say but honestly it's not right to just dump the cat. \n\nI can say dating the guy in the first place if he had issues was wrong and learn from it.

This cat has only you to rely on and you chose to rescue him. \n\nIf it's just a headache and no other symptoms going on and he's interacting with you multiple times a week I say thats the worst and he could suck it up or decide it wasn't right to date.

His name is Apollo and I (26F) adopted him from the humane society at 3 years old in 2018, with my ex husband. Fast forward to August 2021, I finally leave my ex husband in Kansas and move back to Texas. From this marriage we had to split our pets. I took my cat Apollo, and my dog Nyx. During the transition I started dating my current boyfriend 28M. \n\nApollo is now 8 years old and I\u2019m living in my own apartment with him and my dog. I really love my cat. My boyfriend and have have now been dating for over a year and have been talking about getting engaged and moving in together. When my boyfriend comes over he complains about headaches and blames them on the cat. He states that allergy medications don\u2019t help and that he shouldn\u2019t have to rely on them on a daily basis to live in his own house. He does not want to take allergy shots. I have made several adjustments to try to accommodate for his allergy, but he says nothing helps. This includes keeping Apollo out of the bedroom, two air purifiers in my 770 sq ft space, wiping Apollo down with an anti allergy solution, and vacuuming multiple times a week. He said nothing helped his headache. Mind you, he complains of no other symptoms. He has allergies in general I believe, because he taken Claritin since started dating.\n\nHe dotes all over my dog but clearly hates my cat. He has stated he wants me to rehome him to one of his friends so at least I can \u201cstill see him\u201d. Despite this one thing, we get get along great, our values are aligned, and I can truly see a bright future together. I truly love my Apollo. He is such a laid back little guy and is super loving. I just don\u2019t think I can rehome him, but at the same time I don\u2019t want to break up with my boyfriend. \n\nWhen I told my boyfriend this, he couldn\u2019t believe I would pick a cat over the relationship. AITA for asking him to let me keep my cat despite his allergy?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The fact that he doesn't have itchy or watery eyes, or sneezes around Apollo makes me kind of think he's not actually allergic to the cat. Maybe it's just my personal experience, but I'm wary of anyone who claims they are allergic to cats. I feel like a lot of people say this even when it's not true, just because they don't like cats.

Of course, if he can\u2019t build his tolerance after time, there are other options.

Solution was at least weekly injections or remove the allergen. We moved.\n\nThe crux of this issue is simple. He will not live with the cat. She wants both. She has a decision to make and refuses to make it. She\u2019s the asshole here, as the guy has made it quite clear, the cat needs to go for me to move in, while she pines and whines for both.", "Same here. All of mine and my fianc\u00e9's symptoms with our cats are itchy eyes, stuffy/runny nose, sneezing, and such. They don't ever give me headaches but the times I've seen other people get headaches from it, it is because of the other symptoms. The fact that the guy only gets a headache is very suspicious.", "Right, I get a headache as the end result of severe allergies after I've been sneezing and congested for several hours. I don't just get a headache by itself.", "Not necessarily visible ones though. Like I get pain radiating from my cheek bone to my ear but you can't see that so you need to trust me.", "Not for everyone. And umm flushes do more then clean air....", "And a person who hates a cat as much as op's boyfriend might make sure it has an \"accident\"", "Is it hyacinth? I hsve yearly issues with thinking those are pretty before they try to kill me", "I love that. You gotta love when they run after them when they hear or notice them \u2764\ufe0f", "I've heard the neti pot does wonders. I was curious if that would work for me. \nI avoid now antibiotics at all costs. It has made my immune system crap itself so I get that. Food avoidance helps with my nose atm as well. I dont do dairy to stop a flare up", "And that\u2019s fine. He shouldn\u2019t be expected to undertake monthly shots he may not be able to afford to be in a relationship. Doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s a bad guy.", "For me, this is the issue. He hasn\u2019t actually gone to an allergy specialist to get his allergies tested. Before I asked someone to make a decision like that I would definitely try everything possible to manage it. It sounds like he refuses to even consider allergy shots. He knows OP loves her cat. He should be willing to go to an allergist if he\u2019s serious about this relationship. That fact that he\u2019s not, is a red flag to me.", "Yeah, I don\u2019t trust that this BF has actually tried anything other than Claritin which he claims he takes for other allergies (but doesn\u2019t want to rely on daily meds to live at the same time?). Between that and the only symptom being a headache, he should at the very least get an allergy test to make sure he\u2019s actually allergic to the cat and not, say, the dog.", "Why is she the asshole when he started dating her knowing she has a cat and claiming he\u2019s allergic to it? And why isn\u2019t he the asshole for simply breaking up with her rather than forcing her to make the choice?", "But the headache is in fact not your only symptom and I am guessing you also have congestion in your sinuses which would be another symptom", "People who can do such things are truly evil.", "I think it was an orchid? But I could be remembering it wrong", "I can already see it, forcing her to get rid of the cat, then systematically making her get rid of the dog next", "It's obvious he hasn't got serious allergies and he can deal with a headache in my opinion. I get infections and rashes and at this moment my eyes are watering and im itchy as hell. So what lol I love my cat and wouldn't change that. Just when I need to stop I can't snuggle the furball lol he's full of shit to me", "He doesn\u2019t seem to be the one pushing for both. She does. She wants him, and the cat. He said I can\u2019t be around the cat. But she wants both. That\u2019s why she\u2019s the asshole. He\u2019s pretty plainly put the choice out there, she won\u2019t make it.", "Weirdly enough no! Like I can feel the pressure further up but I don't sound congested and I can breathe through my nose.\n\n(This is where reddit tells me this isn't a sinus headache isn't it? Oh well. If they hsve ways to fix it I'm all for it.)", "I don\u2019t know I am not a doctor but I wish you luck. You do have sinuses located  kind of next to your nose/ cheek area and you can google tricks to drain them.", "No, I get these, too. For me, it's from the sinuses swelling. Decongestant meds work, despite not feeling congested.", "Yeeep. Unfortunately my supermarket delivery sent a different type of cold meds and that is why I am flat on my back in bed browsing reddit after the room went all swoopy"]}
