This was a girl (18F) who currently was living in another family's home around 15 minutes from my old high school. She didn't have a car and thus felt bad that she was asking her host family for rides to school events, friends' houses, etc. The host family decided to put up a Facebook post up saying that it was not extremely urgent, but that she would love a host family closer.\n\nKeep in mind this is all being told to me for the first time while in front of my friend.

I ask where she will be sleeping, and they say something along the lines of \"obviously in your bed.\" My parents both laugh at me and say that I am just jealous my brother will have a girl in the house. It was an extremely weird atmosphere because my parents seemed to have decided before telling me, but had waited until the final days of my summer vacation to inform me. I went to bed with a feeling that was unwell, and when I eventually flew out, it was all I could think about.\n\nBy the second week I was gone, and the girl was already moved in.

I would have given my bed to this chick, even though I haven't met her, I wouldn't kick her into the common space, especially because my bed is where she had been sleeping for a month now.

Your parents are not considering your feelings at all, and in fact seem to think that any discomfort or distress you are feeling at the choice they made is outweighed by their charity.  That's a dangerous way of looking at life . . . the \"ends justifying the means.\"  I would not take their actions as a sign that they love you any less.

While some of the other comments calling you an AH have a point, especially about the fact that it's your parents house and they can make whatever rules they want,  they disregard the fact that that is also your home, and YOUR room until the day that you have permanently moved out of the house into your full adult life. What those folks are missing is the fact that your safe space (your room and your home) has been taken from you, and you have basically been relegated to a temporary guest instead of a member of the household. Your parents did you and your sibling(s) a giant disfavor by not discussing hosting anyone for a length of time with all of you. This should be your home as much as theirs, and any drastic change that can or will affect everyone should be discussed and agreed upon by everyone. As for going home for holidays, politely inform your family (particularly your mother) that while you love them, you do not agree with being treated and made to feel like you are a distant family member that will be temporarily housed out of politeness instead of their son/sibling who should have a right to be treated as a close family member with a longterm place in the home. Make it clear that you would not have had an objection to an exchange student in the home, and even the use of your room so long as it had been discussed with you instead of taking an attitude that made you feel they might as well have asked you to pack all your things and leave to never come back. Something you may want to consider for future visits is staying at a reasonably priced hotel for the few nights you would be there (or one of those extended stay places that you can pay by week if it will be longer) as long as there isn't room for you in the house. The sofa would be fine for maybe one night for an immediate family member, but not longer. If your parents get upset by this, politely tell them that they are the ones who have made you feel like the distant guest, and typically it is only polite for distant guests to use a hotel and not invade someone's home even if they have permission.", "INFO: what exactly are you mad about?", "NTA\n\nnow, I want to make something clear...they have every right to take in an exchange student and that room is theirs to use.\n\nHowever, the way,they did it was shittty and you are perfectly find to have hurt feelings. \n\nThe flippant way theu have treated you is why they are AH. \n\nI have never understood families keeping rooms like shrines when kids have moved out.\n\nMy children will always have a safe place to stay with me, but that doesn't mean I am  keeping a room as a tine capsule either.", "[deleted]", "ESH here except the foreign exchange student.\n\nYour parents should have told you what was going on before your last day home.\n\nYour mom should have had more tact in talking about Thanksgiving arrangements.\n\nYou should not take your anger out if this poor girl who was thrown into this situation.\n\nYour decision to not go home for Thanksgiving is wise on many levels.\n\nYou will not be happy being there\n\nYou would end up taking it out on the foreign exchange student\n\nIt is likely you would have an argument with your parents about this.\n\nStay at school and figure out a way to get past this before Christmas break.

Outside of one week it doesn\u2019t impact you at all. This is kinda petty but you are 19 and you are in the impulse control stage of life while your brain finishes development. Not an excuse.

That being said, I think it\u2019s worth it to reach out to your mom and talk about this. \n\nI am a mom and my youngest just turned 18. My next oldest is 19.5. They both still live at home.

Your parents didn't ask you if it was okay to give up your room and didn't even ask if you wanted them to pack up your personal things.

Its not your room if you've moved out. But it's your call who you spend your holidays with.", "YTA.  You have moved out of the house and into the next chapter of your life.  It\u2019s pretty common for parents to change over a bedroom when a kid moves off to college, precisely because the plan is for that kid not to live in that room again, except potentially for intermittent periods like school breaks and summers.  You have to stand on your own two feet and move forward into your own life, rather than focusing on the loss of no longer being in childhood.", "NAH. Your parents didn\u2019t consult you about the use of a room that you no longer live in. Would you expect your parents to get your permission to use you former bedroom as a guest room? Or an office, or gym, or anything else? Of course not, it\u2019s there house, and they can do with it what they want.  You feel a certain way about \u201cbeing replaced,\u201d and your feelings are perfectly valid, whether or not you are correct about the situation.

It does seem childish that you\u2019re expecting the house you\u2019ve moved out of to be kept as a shrine for you in your absence. On the flip side your parents are making a fuss over this exchange student and I can understand why that would feel disorientating. But there\u2019s other weird stuff. You said they would normally call you on the weekend since you\u2019d moved interstate but by that time you were in week 2, so basically they called you week 1 and this was now your expectation as the \u201cusual\u201d from then on? It does come across like jealousy but I\u2019d wager 80% of it is in your head and the focus you\u2019re putting on the interactions not being as you expected them to go - maybe you thought the parents would be feeling sad that you were gone and that\u2019s not happened really.

I don't understand this attitude- you want your parents to close your room off as a shrine for the sake of a weekend? Hosting a child from overseas is an incredible experience- I work in this field and it's phenomenal. It's not like they're adopting, it's just for an academic year, or semester. And no, it's usually not paid, and you're expected to do activities with them on weekends, but it's a chance to have a cultural experience that most people treasure their entire lives. I've had a host family and the bonds were amazing. And I'm very glad my host family were not as selfish as you were. \n\nWould you not go home if you had family visiting? Have you really never had to give up your room around the holidays when families come together to celebrate? It's really sad if you haven't- we don't do Thanksgiving much in my house but at OP's age we used to have two to three families at home during the holidays and yes, it can get to be a lot, but I wouldn't exchange those times for anything. That is how you build your village. \n\nLook, you're an adult, and there will be adult consequences for this. You can spend the holiday alone, and miss out not just on family time, but also the chance to meet a host sibling because you were mad that she's using your room. They will have fun without you and eat a delicious meal. But remember that she will always know you as the host brother who didn't want to come home and meet her because you were mad at the fact that your parents didn't ask your input before deciding to bring her into their home, and that's going to be her impression of American teenagers.", "INFO: What is your current level of financial support from your parents? Who paid for the plane ticket?", "NTA", "NTA\nIt seems strange to me that your keeping your room and your stuff you don't need to take to college wasn't the default assumption in this situation. Your attending college includes short term housing, which many (if not most) families view as \"being away\" rather than \"moved out.\" Yeah, you can't control your parents' decisions about their home. This decision changed your room from your familiar reliable soft landing place to a \"spare room\" that may have different occupants. \n\nWhat happened to your belongings that you expected to leave in your room? Did you, or they, move them? Are they still in that room, and available for any guest to use? Is there any place in their home where your belongings are stored and your privacy respected and protected?\n\nYour feelings and perspective are valid. I'd feel \"moved out\" by my parents. Even temporarily, your personal space in their home no longer exists. Whatever safety and security you felt for your room in your parents' home was erased by their decision to give it away AND by the calculated way it was sprung on you, so the expected push back would be minimized for them. It's normal that you didn't plan nor expect to be \"moved out\" of your small personal space in the home because you go to college. \n\nThey've made a series of decisions that have stripped you of the sense of belonging and security you had in their home. They now treat you as an extra visitor, to couch surf while a tenant occupies your former space. You have the right to choose not to participate in events and situations that feel bad.", "NTA\n\nIt might be useful to write your parents a letter explaining how you feel. I find this a useful tactic when dealing with conversations with people who may not be as open to hearing what one has to say. You can explain how you feel pushed aside, and how your objection comes from how they chose to communicate all of this to you. \n\nSo many issues on this sub are due to a break down in communication. Little rifts become big ones because no one is a mind reader. You are well within your right to not go home for Thanksgiving.

The \"you are sleeping on the couch\" comment is especially rash.\n\nHowever, you are 18 and moved out for college. Being able to return home after attending college and being able to stay there for potentially a few years in your off time is a huge benefit you should be grateful for.\n\nA lot of people have to move out at 18 get a job and support themselves without their parents assistance.

Having your room taken from you and being so clearly forced into the role of guest must feel very alienating. NTA", "Nope", "NTA \n\nEnjoy your thanksgiving with your cell off.", "So you\u2019ll have to deal with this for a year maybe? I understand why you\u2019re mad but I still think YTA, they didn\u2019t adopt a 2nd child", "NTA. You were being a brat right up until you were expected to sleep on the couch.", "NTA. Honestly I wouldn\u2019t even go back for Christmas.", "What was with the comment about being jealous that brother will have a girl in the house? Are they hoping brother hooks up with exchange student? What does it matter if it's a girl or a boy...if they are moving someone into your room regardless of your feelings, would have made things better on your end if it were a boy? Doubtful. \n\nFeeling replaced doesn't have to be a son for son thing, it could have been a treadmill or a puppy...whatever was moved in to make it so you don't feel welcome in your childhood home is an issue. \n\nBut also, what exchange student is already in town so long before school starts that they have enough time to know they live too far away from their friends? It all reads as a little too weird for my liking. \n\nNTA", "INFO: Where do you want her to sleep for thanksgiving? What resolution are you looking for?", "Yes you are.", "NTA at all! I couldn\u2019t imagine treating my kids like your parents are treating you. And I\u2019m sorry that your parents are like this.", "Life happens though, even after someone goes to college. My parents moved cross-country a month after I went to school so I had no bedroom to go home to for Thanksgiving either and I didn't cut them out of my life for it.  A friend of mine's mom turned his room into a sewing room once he was out of the house.  This really isn't out of the normal (though I think OP's parents are being needlessly rude about it).  Some people get lucky and they have that space preserved for them.  Others have parents who assume once the kid is out of the nest, they aren't coming back.", "[removed]", "[removed]", "His room?? How entitled is that?  How about their room they provided and pay taxes on.", "Honestly it looks like they were already damaged by pretty much pushing OP to the side in favor for the new girl", "I didn\u2019t know leaving for college was \u201cmoving out\u201d that\u2019s really just leaving for a while because most dorms don\u2019t allow students to stay over the holidays or summer breaks. So op was well with in their rights to expect to have their room to come home too. That would almost be like giving a away someone\u2019s room that was in the hospital for a little longer then average or an extended vacation.", "I agree with the calling part but I disagree with the eviction part. His parents knew and expected him to be home for weeks at a time during the year but still gave his room up to a stranger in his eyes as soon as he was gone. They expect him to sleep on a mattress on the floor in what is supposedly meant to be his home and made no compromise.\n\nHis parents have the right to do what they want in their home but, they also shouldn't expect others to be understanding when their child is treated like a guest in the home their grew up in.", "And he IS handling it, by choosing to spend his time somewhere else. He isn't berating his parents or the foreign exchange student, he's not doing or saying anything malicious.\n\nHe just made a choice of his own which was, of course, in response to his parents' decision, but that's also a part of being an adult: acknowledging and accepting that one's actions will engender reactions, and that another person's reactions are not under our control.\n\nAs far as I can tell, it seems that the only people failing to recognize this fact are OP's parents.", "Yeah, this sub is mostly filled with teenagers and \"adults\" who failed to launch.\n\nOP, you sure sound like a child to me. Which to be fair, you're at that age where you could go either way. How embarrassing for you, that your parents estimated you to be in the \"adult\" category and you almost immediately showed them otherwise. YTA, probably best you don't go home now anyway, cause (if your family is like mine) you'd be sitting at the kids table, where you belong.", "He just moved for school. Ask it's his room, it's filled with his personal items, so yes it's his room. And the parents are big assholes about how they did this.", "Why is op the ah? He didn't say they couldn't he just isn't coming back. That doesn't make him an ah", "He was literally kicked out of his own room, being dismissed of his feelings, and her mother was very unempathetic about it. Why would he be going home to an environment that's uncomfortable? Why spend time with them when they clearly don't care about his feelings?", "This is the actual adult take on the issue that I was hoping for. I understand OP being a bit broadsided by the whole thing, but to continue to hold a grudge shows a distinct lack of introspection and self-awareness. I hope they use the time at college to grow up and learn to function in the adult world.", "He won't. Being uncomfortable in your own home is way worse than be alone.", "And we allllllll winnnn\n\nThe world is all rainbows and unicorns farting glitter", "This is an exact copy from a larger comment from three hours earlier.

Too often someone reacting appropriately to an insult is then blamed for \"damaging the relationship\" instead of the person insulting them in the first place.", "Were they really \"pushing\" him to the side? He went off to college a state away! Jeez, yes the parents handled it horribly but come on this is basically crying over spilled milk. OP is 19 not 12.", "Yes.  But, he is best served by trying to not make it worse.", "Only on Reddit", "You know what moving out for school is called? It\u2019s called moving out. The room is not his.", "Your relationship to your parents will be damaged because they temporarily took in a foreign exchange student to help them out? Seriously?", "For a weekend! Not for his entire life. And he is away at college. It's not as if it's been remodeled. Maybe his generation grew up differently but in mine we often had to around the holidays. That was part of opening your home, which (aside from genocide) is supposed to be the entire point of this one! It's part of having a community and not just a nuclear home. And the best part is that your host sibling will always open their door to you too.\n\nMaybe it's just me, but if am 18 year old tells me they're sleeping on the couch for a weekend, I'm just shrugging and saying okay and not feeling any real need to be empathetic. Because I've done this a bunch of times and it's really not a big deal.", "The first few months of college are a really hard time for a lot of kids, and knowing they still have a home base can be really psychologically important. Like, a 12' x 12' dorm room that you share with one or two other people and doesn't have room to fit both your summer and winter clothes at once is NOT \"home.\" This is the same vibe of parents who turn a kid's bedroom into a hobby room and get rid of their stuff the week they leave for college. A gradual transition is the loving thing to do - at minimum they should have a bed to sleep in when they come home the first time.", "I'm gonna go out on a limb and say that the law of action and reaction extends further than reddit's domain", "Cause they want to play happy family.", "Also what if they drop out or something else happens? When the 'rona first hit, tons of students were kicked out of their accommodations, what if that happens again? What if OP falls seriously ill or gets injured? Are they supposed to heal on the couch?\n\nThere's just so many things that can go wrong at that stage of life and not considering that is really stupid and really rude to OP.", "I mean I speak from personal experience. I went to college 1000 miles away and my parents changed up my room. I didn't care because I was 1000 miles away. What did it matter to me? For me I considered the whole house my space so a particular room didn't really matter.", "This part I don't get. Why didn't OP call her parents either?", "That's the case for you, specifically. Op clearly isn't of the same mindset hence this post.", "You say you didn\u2019t care but the way you\u2019ve worded this seems to suggest it did matter to you, lol. \n\nIt\u2019s not about the *space* it\u2019s about his parents constantly reminding him he\u2019s less important than this random person they just met.", "I mean I get it - my parents were at the extreme other end of the spectrum and basically left my room untouched through grad school, which at some point was honestly kind of insulting. Like, I had a whole-ass apartment and adult life in another state. Obviously every kid is different - some thrive immediately at college and don't feel as much like they need that safety net. For me personally, if I have the resources (e.g., younger siblings aren't sharing a room) I will try to keep my kids room more or less \"theirs\" for the first year of college at least (not saying I won't put a desk or workout equipment in there, but mostly reserved for them). If that's not possible, I would involve them in the decision making and get their input on how they want to handle it - and make sure they have a freaking bed to sleep in at Thanksgiving.", "Notice how you said mindset. So yes his feelings are valid. I mentioned such in another comment on this thread. But does that really justify missing Thanksgiving?\n\nOp got upset his mom teased him about sleeping on the couch. His feeling are not invalid on feeling bad about that. But that tease is the equivalent of saying haha u/Mittrel has mismatched socks *points and laughs* haha. \n\nWill it make you feel bad for your socks? Yes. But it's socks at the end of the day.", "It didn't matter because I'm not using it. Idk how you're getting the opposite out of that.\n\nAnd how are they constantly reminding him he isn't important? They could have just moved her in without telling him. They could have just not invited him back for Thanksgiving. Op, who is paying for college? And your daily expenses?\n\nThey temporarily gave up a room. They didn't tear it down. She won't even be there when he goes home for winter break. So what's the problem", "My in-laws had my husband's room entirely persevered until he was 33 years old and married with multiple children - right down to his middle school drawings in his desk.  It's still mostly intact but they've taken his posters off the walls at this point.", "Yeah moving someone into your room, into your bed without your permission is a violation. Doesn\u2019t matter for how long it is. \n\nEspecially with all the snide reminders about how OP will have to sleep on the couch. Also, OP could be a scholarship student, but even IF his parents pay for him that doesn\u2019t somehow magically make this okay on their part. Them fulfilling their parental duty to take care of their kids doesn\u2019t absolve them of asshole behavior.", "Honestly if my parents hadn't gotten divorced and sold the house I am CONFIDENT this would be true for me too.", "Paying for college =/= parental duty. That's an asinine opinion. \n\nMy point about them paying his expenses post 18 is an example of how they aren't shoving him to the side, replacing him, or treating him poorly. This one event does not justify the reaction. I almost want to say he's throwing a tantrum looking for attention by not going for home for Thanksgiving. Almost, but I won't because at the very least his feelings are valid.", "It's very interesting as a wife to be able to visit a shrine to one's husband's youth."]}
