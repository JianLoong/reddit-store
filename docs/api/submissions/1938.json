This was a girl (18F) who currently was living in another family's home around 15 minutes from my old high school. She didn't have a car and thus felt bad that she was asking her host family for rides to school events, friends' houses, etc. The host family decided to put up a Facebook post up saying that it was not extremely urgent, but that she would love a host family closer.\n\nKeep in mind this is all being told to me for the first time while in front of my friend. I bring up instantly that it feels like as soon as I am going away for college it feels like I am being replaced. I ask where she will be sleeping, and they say something along the lines of \"obviously in your bed.\" My parents both laugh at me and say that I am just jealous my brother will have a girl in the house. It was an extremely weird atmosphere because my parents seemed to have decided before telling me, but had waited until the final days of my summer vacation to inform me. I went to bed with a feeling that was unwell, and when I eventually flew out, it was all I could think about.\n\nBy the second week I was gone, and the girl was already moved in. My parents normally call me on the weekend to catch up as I am a state away, and it's not something I normally think much of, but the call didn't come that weekend.

I would have given my bed to this chick, even though I haven't met her, I wouldn't kick her into the common space, especially because my bed is where she had been sleeping for a month now.

Your parents are not considering your feelings at all, and in fact seem to think that any discomfort or distress you are feeling at the choice they made is outweighed by their charity.  That's a dangerous way of looking at life . . . the \"ends justifying the means.\"  I would not take their actions as a sign that they love you any less.

While some of the other comments calling you an AH have a point, especially about the fact that it's your parents house and they can make whatever rules they want,  they disregard the fact that that is also your home, and YOUR room until the day that you have permanently moved out of the house into your full adult life. What those folks are missing is the fact that your safe space (your room and your home) has been taken from you, and you have basically been relegated to a temporary guest instead of a member of the household. Your parents did you and your sibling(s) a giant disfavor by not discussing hosting anyone for a length of time with all of you. This should be your home as much as theirs, and any drastic change that can or will affect everyone should be discussed and agreed upon by everyone. As for going home for holidays, politely inform your family (particularly your mother) that while you love them, you do not agree with being treated and made to feel like you are a distant family member that will be temporarily housed out of politeness instead of their son/sibling who should have a right to be treated as a close family member with a longterm place in the home. Make it clear that you would not have had an objection to an exchange student in the home, and even the use of your room so long as it had been discussed with you instead of taking an attitude that made you feel they might as well have asked you to pack all your things and leave to never come back. Something you may want to consider for future visits is staying at a reasonably priced hotel for the few nights you would be there (or one of those extended stay places that you can pay by week if it will be longer) as long as there isn't room for you in the house. The sofa would be fine for maybe one night for an immediate family member, but not longer. If your parents get upset by this, politely tell them that they are the ones who have made you feel like the distant guest, and typically it is only polite for distant guests to use a hotel and not invade someone's home even if they have permission.", "INFO: what exactly are you mad about?", "NTA\n\nnow, I want to make something clear...they have every right to take in an exchange student and that room is theirs to use.\n\nHowever, the way,they did it was shittty and you are perfectly find to have hurt feelings. \n\nThe flippant way theu have treated you is why they are AH. \n\nI have never understood families keeping rooms like shrines when kids have moved out.\n\nMy children will always have a safe place to stay with me, but that doesn't mean I am  keeping a room as a tine capsule either.", "[deleted]", "ESH here except the foreign exchange student.\n\nYour parents should have told you what was going on before your last day home.\n\nYour mom should have had more tact in talking about Thanksgiving arrangements.\n\nYou should not take your anger out if this poor girl who was thrown into this situation.\n\nYour decision to not go home for Thanksgiving is wise on many levels.\n\nYou will not be happy being there\n\nYou would end up taking it out on the foreign exchange student\n\nIt is likely you would have an argument with your parents about this.\n\nStay at school and figure out a way to get past this before Christmas break.

Outside of one week it doesn\u2019t impact you at all. This is kinda petty but you are 19 and you are in the impulse control stage of life while your brain finishes development. Not an excuse.

That being said, I think it\u2019s worth it to reach out to your mom and talk about this. \n\nI am a mom and my youngest just turned 18. My next oldest is 19.5. They both still live at home.

Your parents didn't ask you if it was okay to give up your room and didn't even ask if you wanted them to pack up your personal things.

Its not your room if you've moved out. But it's your call who you spend your holidays with.", "YTA.  You have moved out of the house and into the next chapter of your life.  It\u2019s pretty common for parents to change over a bedroom when a kid moves off to college, precisely because the plan is for that kid not to live in that room again, except potentially for intermittent periods like school breaks and summers.  You have to stand on your own two feet and move forward into your own life, rather than focusing on the loss of no longer being in childhood.", "NAH. Your parents didn\u2019t consult you about the use of a room that you no longer live in. Would you expect your parents to get your permission to use you former bedroom as a guest room?

You feel a certain way about \u201cbeing replaced,\u201d and your feelings are perfectly valid, whether or not you are correct about the situation.

It does seem childish that you\u2019re expecting the house you\u2019ve moved out of to be kept as a shrine for you in your absence. On the flip side your parents are making a fuss over this exchange student and I can understand why that would feel disorientating. But there\u2019s other weird stuff.

It does come across like jealousy but I\u2019d wager 80% of it is in your head and the focus you\u2019re putting on the interactions not being as you expected them to go - maybe you thought the parents would be feeling sad that you were gone and that\u2019s not happened really.

I don't understand this attitude- you want your parents to close your room off as a shrine for the sake of a weekend? Hosting a child from overseas is an incredible experience- I work in this field and it's phenomenal. It's not like they're adopting, it's just for an academic year, or semester. And no, it's usually not paid, and you're expected to do activities with them on weekends, but it's a chance to have a cultural experience that most people treasure their entire lives. I've had a host family and the bonds were amazing. And I'm very glad my host family were not as selfish as you were. \n\nWould you not go home if you had family visiting? Have you really never had to give up your room around the holidays when families come together to celebrate? It's really sad if you haven't- we don't do Thanksgiving much in my house but at OP's age we used to have two to three families at home during the holidays and yes, it can get to be a lot, but I wouldn't exchange those times for anything. That is how you build your village. \n\nLook, you're an adult, and there will be adult consequences for this. You can spend the holiday alone, and miss out not just on family time, but also the chance to meet a host sibling because you were mad that she's using your room. They will have fun without you and eat a delicious meal. But remember that she will always know you as the host brother who didn't want to come home and meet her because you were mad at the fact that your parents didn't ask your input before deciding to bring her into their home, and that's going to be her impression of American teenagers.", "INFO: What is your current level of financial support from your parents? Who paid for the plane ticket?", "NTA", "NTA\nIt seems strange to me that your keeping your room and your stuff you don't need to take to college wasn't the default assumption in this situation. Your attending college includes short term housing, which many (if not most) families view as \"being away\" rather than \"moved out.\" Yeah, you can't control your parents' decisions about their home. This decision changed your room from your familiar reliable soft landing place to a \"spare room\" that may have different occupants. \n\nWhat happened to your belongings that you expected to leave in your room? Did you, or they, move them? Are they still in that room, and available for any guest to use? Is there any place in their home where your belongings are stored and your privacy respected and protected?\n\nYour feelings and perspective are valid. I'd feel \"moved out\" by my parents. Even temporarily, your personal space in their home no longer exists. Whatever safety and security you felt for your room in your parents' home was erased by their decision to give it away AND by the calculated way it was sprung on you, so the expected push back would be minimized for them. It's normal that you didn't plan nor expect to be \"moved out\" of your small personal space in the home because you go to college. \n\nThey've made a series of decisions that have stripped you of the sense of belonging and security you had in their home. They now treat you as an extra visitor, to couch surf while a tenant occupies your former space. You have the right to choose not to participate in events and situations that feel bad.", "NTA\n\nIt might be useful to write your parents a letter explaining how you feel. I find this a useful tactic when dealing with conversations with people who may not be as open to hearing what one has to say. You can explain how you feel pushed aside, and how your objection comes from how they chose to communicate all of this to you. \n\nSo many issues on this sub are due to a break down in communication. Little rifts become big ones because no one is a mind reader. You are well within your right to not go home for Thanksgiving.

The \"you are sleeping on the couch\" comment is especially rash.\n\nHowever, you are 18 and moved out for college. Being able to return home after attending college and being able to stay there for potentially a few years in your off time is a huge benefit you should be grateful for.\n\nA lot of people have to move out at 18 get a job and support themselves without their parents assistance.

Little do they know another teenager isn't the same, but it is kind of them to do what they are doing.\n\nHaving hosted 10 exchange students, I can confidently say the student also sucks in giving up on a perfectly fine host family so early in the game just because of transportation--a common theme among students who come from countries with better mass transit than ours.  Most kids would have given her rides and sounds like the host family was willing to help her out, she was just being spoiled.\n\nCalm down, don't go home for Thanksgiving if you don't want to, but chill.  This is a VERY temporary situation--the student will be gone by next summer and you and your family don't want to permanently damage your relationship just because you're a little jealous right now.", "You will probably end up marrying her lol.  But yeah, it's just a temporary thing so you should probably not get too upset about it.", "NTA, but your parents aren\u2019t either. It\u2019s normal to consider how to use space in a home after a child leaves. My room became a formal guest room about 5 minutes after I left for college. And I was only 45 minutes away. I respect your right to spend Thanksgiving as you choose though. And if being a guest in your own home doesn\u2019t feel good, go find the international crowd who doesn\u2019t go home,", "NTA. Personally, I\u2019d stay at school over Christmas too.", "I\u2019m going with NTA. But I think what\u2019s happening here is that both you and your parents are failing to understand the other\u2019s perspective. I can speak to this one as someone who once went through a similar situation, and as someone who is now many years on the other side of it. (In my case, my mom moved my brother into my room when I left for college, and out my stuff in his smaller room. Then once he graduated, she moved into a 2-bedroom condo\u2014while I was still in college\u2014leaving me, effectively, without a room to come back to.)\n\nI think what your parents (and mine) failed to see is how much we needed that sense of security and stability even as we were going off into the wider world. Like, everything else in your life is changing, so you still want that sense of having a home base to come back to when you\u2019re sad, or scared, or lonely. In allowing the exchange student to stay with them, they have taken away that feeling from you.\n\nBut from your parents\u2019 perspective: your room would be sitting empty for months while you were at school, and they had the space and the opportunity to do a favor for a friend of yours. They didn\u2019t need to ask your permission, because you wouldn\u2019t be there anyway! (Also, the whole \u201cit\u2019s our house, because we pay for it\u201d mentality may come into play.) Her presence is temporary. And maybe it is, in some ways, a means of distracting themselves from missing you. But in their minds, you\u2019re off stretching your wings and becoming an adult. To them, it\u2019s just a room. They aren\u2019t preventing you from coming home. They\u2019re still there, and your brother. But it doesn\u2019t make sense to displace this girl when you\u2019re only going to be using the room for a few days! \n\nI think the onus should be on your parents to have the emotional intelligence and maturity to realize how much this sense of displacement is hurting you. But you\u2019d be amazed at how many blind spots parents can have when it comes to their kids. My mom never got it either, and I didn\u2019t know how to explain it to her at the time. But my guess is that they never wanted you to feel like you\u2019re being replaced, nor are they actually trying to replace you. They\u2019re just trying to give you the space you need to grow away from them. What they don\u2019t realize is that you\u2019ve got space, but you need security.\n\nSo my suggestion is this: if you can, talk to them. Tell them how you\u2019re feeling. Focus on your emotions, rather than their actions. Don\u2019t be accusatory. Hopefully you can try to come to an understanding so you can come home for Thanksgiving. And if you can\u2019t\u2026I get it. Again, parents\u2019 blind spots can be HUGE, and if yours are anything like mine they may become defensive. (That\u2019s why you should focus on your emotions and not their actions.) But I think it\u2019s worth trying to resolve this before Thanksgiving, and figuring out if there\u2019s a way you can spend the weekend at home without it fueling anger or resentment. \n\nGood luck!", "Yup. A week after I'd moved out, every sign I'd had a place in my parents house was scrubbed away. It... okay, yeah, they could do whatever, it was their house. I get that. But I won't deny that my feelings about it are... complex even more than a decade and a half later. And, yeah, it absolutely changed how I looked at them.", "Wait a minute...\n\n...you just made me realize OP has a brother.\n\nINFO:  OP, why wouldn't you be sleeping on a decent air mattress in your brother's room????\n\nThere are twin air mattresses out there now that are super quiet, and they work all night evening out your weight.  They are amazing.  You could check Amazon, find one reasonably priced, and send it to your home address.", "My husband and I both went through what you went through. Now we have 2 college aged kids. We sold the 3 bedroom house and bought a 5 bedroom with 5 baths so that our kids will always have a bedroom and their own bathrooms to come home to whenever they want. Perhaps we overcompensated a bit because of our own trauma, but I have no regrets. The other two bedrooms are a guest room and a study.", "May i ask how the relationship is with your parents now?", "My parents busted through the wall my bedroom shared with their bathroom and turned both rooms into their master bath.

I personally do not know any parents in my circle who do either. Kids come HOME on breaks.  My daughters room will be hers until she literally takes all her things and can support herself after graduation.

This isn\u2019t so much about the physical room in the house. It\u2019s about the emotional room in the house. \n\nIt\u2019s about them giving his room to someone else without even having a proper conversation about it. \n\nIt\u2019s about them suddenly not calling and checking in like they normally would.\n\nIt\u2019s about them not caring to hear his feelings or opinions on the matter and brushing them off repeatedly. \n\nIt\u2019s about the way they minimize his feelings and treat him like he\u2019s wrong for having said feelings. \n\nIt\u2019s about him feeling they *replaced* him.

When I visited my parents a couple months ago I stayed in my old room that became his old room that has now become a guest room. His old room is kinda just storage for our crap we haven't sorted through yet. There's a bed under all the junk somewhere, and next year when we're both there at the same time I'll probably let him have my old room during the day, because he'll be working remote. I'll need it at night because I'll be working remote, but EU hours. We'll both sleep in his first room or the living room or whatever my dad decides, because it stopped being my house like a decade ago, and brother's 7ish years ago. \n\nLike, sure, would be cool to have my room preserved like a tiny museum to 17 year old me, but they kept all my stuff, which is more than some get, and ultimately it made no sense for him to keep using the smaller, worse room for 3 years when mine was empty. Plus mine had the better window for sneaking out of, and was further from the centre of the echoey open plan house. He'd have been in there all the time anyway to study or whatever. like he was before I left.\n\nThat said, in OPs situation I feel like it's NAH or possibly parents are TA, purely because of the way they communicated. But all I see is them saying what's going on in their house/their lives as a way of update, not asking permission, because it's not his anymore. Like, maybe a warning to move your stuff if there's anything you wanted to keep private or whatever, but if it wasn't important enough to take with you, it'll be fine in storage for a bit.", "This is what I was thinking too, I'm honestly surprised to see so many disagree.

Most people I know had their old room turned into a guest room or hobby space. \n\nThe way the parents handled it was not great, and they sort of sprung it on him last minute, which does suck. I'd agree with NTA for that reason. But at the same time, once OP left it was essentially an unused room in their house. I don't get the comments angry at the parents for daring to put it to use.

The loss of the room shouldn't be the focus here because that's just something that happens when people move out of a home (which was my point).  The parents being pretty rude about it is a separate issue.  The Iranian yogurt is not the problem.", "The situation is a pretty spot-on analog, IMO. He moved out, his parents got rid of his room or used it for something else (in this case for *someone* else). That's their right, and something that's bound to happen for families that don't have disposable space. His parents could have handled the delivery better, gotten his opinion, etc. and that makes them TA here. Still doesn't seem worth potentially severing bonds with your parents over. OP should sit them down and explain how it made them feel, if they shrug it off then cancel your flight.", "Exactly, so as he said he'll return for Christmas break when that happens. Seems like s logical response to a slight. NTA", "I feel like OP hadn't really considered what going back for Thanksgiving would be like. Then his mom made that comment and he realized he isn't ready to go back yet. That's his choice. I'm not sure how easy it would be to talk to his mom, she doesn't seem like the sensitive type.\n\nIf not going home for Thanksgiving changes their relationship, they didn't have much of a relationship to begin with.", "Your opinion that op\u2019s parents finances play a roll in this is asinine. Money = \\ = love.", "1. You still ignored big parts of my comments.\n\n>Saying \u201cmy culture is better than your culture\u201d\n\nI never said which one if better, i said i disagree with your, learn to read. What I do think is superior is that in my culture we are still welcome home after school, etc. You also do know that not all white culture is the same? Like a polish is almost the opposite of the Swiss (which i don't like either because of the same reasons I mentioned above)\n\n2.\n>my culture is better than yours.\u201d\n\nI never said this.\n\n3.\n\n\n>I\u2019m not saying you are a racist.\n\nYes you were saying that. Not outright, but the structure of your comment did reflect on this.\n\n4. Why are you trying to make a race \"problem\" about this? I never mentioned any races, so dumb thing to assume...."]}
