Two days before I had left, I had a friend over to eat with us. My parents decided right then was a great time to discuss bringing a foreign exchange student into our home. This was a girl (18F) who currently was living in another family's home around 15 minutes from my old high school. She didn't have a car and thus felt bad that she was asking her host family for rides to school events, friends' houses, etc. The host family decided to put up a Facebook post up saying that it was not extremely urgent, but that she would love a host family closer.\n\nKeep in mind this is all being told to me for the first time while in front of my friend. I bring up instantly that it feels like as soon as I am going away for college it feels like I am being replaced. I ask where she will be sleeping, and they say something along the lines of \"obviously in your bed.\" My parents both laugh at me and say that I am just jealous my brother will have a girl in the house. It was an extremely weird atmosphere because my parents seemed to have decided before telling me, but had waited until the final days of my summer vacation to inform me. I went to bed with a feeling that was unwell, and when I eventually flew out, it was all I could think about.\n\nBy the second week I was gone, and the girl was already moved in. My parents normally call me on the weekend to catch up as I am a state away, and it's not something I normally think much of, but the call didn't come that weekend. I didn't actually hear from them other than through texts for another two weeks.\n\nNow we are in week 4 of classes, and my mother tells me it is time to buy a thanksgiving ticket home. Before I have said anything, she tells me \"remember you have to sleep on the couch!\" I hung up the call. I would have given my bed to this chick, even though I haven't met her, I wouldn't kick her into the common space, especially because my bed is where she had been sleeping for a month now. Even so, it was the way that my mom said it like I didn't know that, which got me upset.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI decided in the end that they chose to have thanksgiving with this girl over me, and that I have every right to spend my thanksgiving with who I wish to as well. I will be back home over Christmas break when she has left. They chose a girl they hadn't met before who was sad she lived 15 minutes from school rather than 5. She wasn't even a new foreign exchange student.\n\nMy parents are calling me childish for acting this way.\n\nso, AITA?\n\nedit: (grammar)", "created_utc": 1668057439, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yr655c/aita_for_canceling_my_plane_ticket_back_home_for/", "score": 59, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The way they told you about the exchange student (clearly having made up their mind before that), only texting and the couch comment. \n\nSeems like you don't want to celebrate Thanksgiving with them? Well that's up to you. \n\nEver noticed that when people do not like decisions they will call those decisions childish.", "NTA. Your parents are the childish ones. It almost sounds like they are being deliberately mean.", "Absolutely NTA. Your parents are completely in the wrong here by allowing this girl, a stranger, to live in YOUR room without consulting you, and then telling you that you'd have to sleep on the couch when you came home. OP, you deserve to spend Thanksgiving with people who care for you and respect you.", "NTA.  Your parents are not considering your feelings at all, and in fact seem to think that any discomfort or distress you are feeling at the choice they made is outweighed by their charity.  That's a dangerous way of looking at life . . . the \"ends justifying the means.\"  I would not take their actions as a sign that they love you any less.  People do strange things when they miss someone or anticipate missing someone.  Do take some time to write them an email explaining how all of this has made you feel, though, before you return for Christmas, and to dispel any continued belief on their part that you are acting \"immature.\"", "NTA.  Your feelings don't have to be endorsed or agreed to by others.   Your decision is your business.   But, think it through because family relationships could be damaged by your decision.", "NTA", "NAH.  Awkward!  I don't think your parents are AH but it is sort of off-putting that you've had your old bedroom given to someone else and are now expected to sleep on the couch.  I think under the circumstances missing Thanksgiving but being home for Christmas is a reasonable solution.", "I'm going to say NTA. While some of the other comments calling you an AH have a point, especially about the fact that it's your parents house and they can make whatever rules they want,  they disregard the fact that that is also your home, and YOUR room until the day that you have permanently moved out of the house into your full adult life. What those folks are missing is the fact that your safe space (your room and your home) has been taken from you, and you have basically been relegated to a temporary guest instead of a member of the household. Your parents did you and your sibling(s) a giant disfavor by not discussing hosting anyone for a length of time with all of you. This should be your home as much as theirs, and any drastic change that can or will affect everyone should be discussed and agreed upon by everyone. As for going home for holidays, politely inform your family (particularly your mother) that while you love them, you do not agree with being treated and made to feel like you are a distant family member that will be temporarily housed out of politeness instead of their son/sibling who should have a right to be treated as a close family member with a longterm place in the home. Make it clear that you would not have had an objection to an exchange student in the home, and even the use of your room so long as it had been discussed with you instead of taking an attitude that made you feel they might as well have asked you to pack all your things and leave to never come back. Something you may want to consider for future visits is staying at a reasonably priced hotel for the few nights you would be there (or one of those extended stay places that you can pay by week if it will be longer) as long as there isn't room for you in the house. The sofa would be fine for maybe one night for an immediate family member, but not longer. If your parents get upset by this, politely tell them that they are the ones who have made you feel like the distant guest, and typically it is only polite for distant guests to use a hotel and not invade someone's home even if they have permission.", "INFO: what exactly are you mad about?", "NTA\n\nnow, I want to make something clear...they have every right to take in an exchange student and that room is theirs to use.\n\nHowever, the way,they did it was shittty and you are perfectly find to have hurt feelings. \n\nThe flippant way theu have treated you is why they are AH. \n\nI have never understood families keeping rooms like shrines when kids have moved out.\n\nMy children will always have a safe place to stay with me, but that doesn't mean I am  keeping a room as a tine capsule either.", "You're an adult no longer living at home or even in the state. It's their house and they can do what they want. Should they have talked to you about it first? Yes. NTA for your feelings on that. But YTA for your feelings about the foreign exchange student. They didn't pick her over you, it's not a competition, and the comment how she is not even a new foreign exchange student, just one who was sad she lives 15 mins away instead of 5.  Ok, imagine living in another country without any family, with a family you just met, and then imagine having to ask them for rides any time you want to do anything or go anywhere. It's awkward and your parents are doing a good thing for her. They should have been more considerate of your feelings in how they went about it, but your negative feelings should not be towards this girl at all, she did nothing to you or anything wrong and h honestly will probably feel terrible when she finds out you aren't coming home or that you are upset by her being there.   \n\n\nYou should consider whether you might regret not going home for thanksgiving. Maybe go meet her and get to know her because you are probably going to have to hear them talk about her for a while, at least be able to know the person they are talking about.", "ESH here except the foreign exchange student.\n\nYour parents should have told you what was going on before your last day home.\n\nYour mom should have had more tact in talking about Thanksgiving arrangements.\n\nYou should not take your anger out if this poor girl who was thrown into this situation.\n\nYour decision to not go home for Thanksgiving is wise on many levels.\n\nYou will not be happy being there\n\nYou would end up taking it out on the foreign exchange student\n\nIt is likely you would have an argument with your parents about this.\n\nStay at school and figure out a way to get past this before Christmas break.

You said you don't mind sleeping on the couch, so what's the problem? You could have called your parents to catch up with them, in fact, you should sometimes. Don't be daft, go home for Thanksgiving.

They saw a need and had space that would only impact you on thanksgiving. It\u2019s not that big of a deal really. They were nice enough to inform you of their decision. FYI since you wouldn\u2019t even be living in the state in a way what you think about them having a foreign exchange student really doesn\u2019t matter. Outside of one week it doesn\u2019t impact you at all. This is kinda petty but you are 19 and you are in the impulse control stage of life while your brain finishes development. Not an excuse. It just seems so petty. I mean I\u2019m not going to my parents for thanksgiving but that\u2019s bc my mom isn\u2019t willing to make sure the Turkey even fits my kiddos\u2019 dietary needs and told me to cook and being an entire thanksgiving dinner to their house 2 hrs away by 11 am.

Your parents handled all this really badly.", "Oh, sorry, somehow I missed the 120 days part. (Have had a long day and have a headache, my reading comprehension is poor!)\n\nI think my judgement is NTA, primarily due to your mom\u2019s comment about having to sleep on the couch. That being said, I think it\u2019s worth it to reach out to your mom and talk about this. \n\nI am a mom and my youngest just turned 18. My next oldest is 19.5. They both still live at home. Thinking about it from a mom\u2019s perspective, maybe she was feeling really sad about you going away to college and decided that having the exchange student would help keep her from feeling sad. \n\nIt\u2019s kind of like you said, \u201creplacement child\u201d, but it\u2019s not because she *wants* to replace you. It\u2019s because she doesn\u2019t want to *miss* you so much, because it hurts, and is sad, and reminds her that she\u2019s getting older, and she doesn\u2019t feel needed as much now. \n\nI could be wrong, of course, but consider reaching out to your mom. Let her know you love her and still need her, even while you\u2019re away at school.", "They reminded the OP to come home for Thanksgiving. (I don't know who's paying for that, but I'll bet its the one with more money.)", "You are kinda right about me not including the 120 days part, I meant to kinda imply it because summer break ends in August. \nMay to August = 120 days", "Paying tickets doesn't mean a thing when they go weeks and weeks without calling. Paying for the ticket is the minimum because it would look terrible to friends, family, and coworkers of they didn't. Unless a family is extremely strapped for money, it is expected that parents help their college students come home for the holidays. If they don't, it is just a huge scandal.", "Yeah after 4 weeks of little contact only texts and that it."]}
