This was a girl (18F) who currently was living in another family's home around 15 minutes from my old high school. She didn't have a car and thus felt bad that she was asking her host family for rides to school events, friends' houses, etc. The host family decided to put up a Facebook post up saying that it was not extremely urgent, but that she would love a host family closer.\n\nKeep in mind this is all being told to me for the first time while in front of my friend.

I ask where she will be sleeping, and they say something along the lines of \"obviously in your bed.\" My parents both laugh at me and say that I am just jealous my brother will have a girl in the house. It was an extremely weird atmosphere because my parents seemed to have decided before telling me, but had waited until the final days of my summer vacation to inform me. I went to bed with a feeling that was unwell, and when I eventually flew out, it was all I could think about.\n\nBy the second week I was gone, and the girl was already moved in.

Your parents are not considering your feelings at all, and in fact seem to think that any discomfort or distress you are feeling at the choice they made is outweighed by their charity.  That's a dangerous way of looking at life . . . the \"ends justifying the means.\"  I would not take their actions as a sign that they love you any less.

While some of the other comments calling you an AH have a point, especially about the fact that it's your parents house and they can make whatever rules they want,  they disregard the fact that that is also your home, and YOUR room until the day that you have permanently moved out of the house into your full adult life. What those folks are missing is the fact that your safe space (your room and your home) has been taken from you, and you have basically been relegated to a temporary guest instead of a member of the household. Your parents did you and your sibling(s) a giant disfavor by not discussing hosting anyone for a length of time with all of you. This should be your home as much as theirs, and any drastic change that can or will affect everyone should be discussed and agreed upon by everyone. As for going home for holidays, politely inform your family (particularly your mother) that while you love them, you do not agree with being treated and made to feel like you are a distant family member that will be temporarily housed out of politeness instead of their son/sibling who should have a right to be treated as a close family member with a longterm place in the home. Make it clear that you would not have had an objection to an exchange student in the home, and even the use of your room so long as it had been discussed with you instead of taking an attitude that made you feel they might as well have asked you to pack all your things and leave to never come back. Something you may want to consider for future visits is staying at a reasonably priced hotel for the few nights you would be there (or one of those extended stay places that you can pay by week if it will be longer) as long as there isn't room for you in the house. The sofa would be fine for maybe one night for an immediate family member, but not longer. If your parents get upset by this, politely tell them that they are the ones who have made you feel like the distant guest, and typically it is only polite for distant guests to use a hotel and not invade someone's home even if they have permission.", "INFO: what exactly are you mad about?", "NTA\n\nnow, I want to make something clear...they have every right to take in an exchange student and that room is theirs to use.\n\nHowever, the way,they did it was shittty and you are perfectly find to have hurt feelings. \n\nThe flippant way theu have treated you is why they are AH. \n\nI have never understood families keeping rooms like shrines when kids have moved out.\n\nMy children will always have a safe place to stay with me, but that doesn't mean I am  keeping a room as a tine capsule either.", "[deleted]", "ESH here except the foreign exchange student.\n\nYour parents should have told you what was going on before your last day home.\n\nYour mom should have had more tact in talking about Thanksgiving arrangements.\n\nYou should not take your anger out if this poor girl who was thrown into this situation.\n\nYour decision to not go home for Thanksgiving is wise on many levels.\n\nYou will not be happy being there\n\nYou would end up taking it out on the foreign exchange student\n\nIt is likely you would have an argument with your parents about this.\n\nStay at school and figure out a way to get past this before Christmas break.

Outside of one week it doesn\u2019t impact you at all. This is kinda petty but you are 19 and you are in the impulse control stage of life while your brain finishes development. Not an excuse.

I thought it was a temporary move, but when I came home for the month long Christmas break, I was given a mattress on the floor in my sister's bedroom as there was not enough floor space left in the other bedroom.\n\n\nMy parents knew I would not be living full time in college, but it was clear I had no place in their home.   \n\n\nOver 45 years later I still cannot understand why they thought this was a reasonable thing to do without any warning.

I think they just ....forgot I wasn't full time in college? .....time ran away?......thought I'd want to stay away?\n\n\nI  went back to my high school to see a favourite teacher, who helped me sort out what to say to them.

It\u2019s pretty common for parents to change over a bedroom when a kid moves off to college, precisely because the plan is for that kid not to live in that room again, except potentially for intermittent periods like school breaks and summers.

It does come across like jealousy but I\u2019d wager 80% of it is in your head and the focus you\u2019re putting on the interactions not being as you expected them to go - maybe you thought the parents would be feeling sad that you were gone and that\u2019s not happened really.

I don't understand this attitude- you want your parents to close your room off as a shrine for the sake of a weekend? Hosting a child from overseas is an incredible experience- I work in this field and it's phenomenal. It's not like they're adopting, it's just for an academic year, or semester. And no, it's usually not paid, and you're expected to do activities with them on weekends, but it's a chance to have a cultural experience that most people treasure their entire lives. I've had a host family and the bonds were amazing. And I'm very glad my host family were not as selfish as you were. \n\nWould you not go home if you had family visiting? Have you really never had to give up your room around the holidays when families come together to celebrate? It's really sad if you haven't- we don't do Thanksgiving much in my house but at OP's age we used to have two to three families at home during the holidays and yes, it can get to be a lot, but I wouldn't exchange those times for anything. That is how you build your village. \n\nLook, you're an adult, and there will be adult consequences for this. You can spend the holiday alone, and miss out not just on family time, but also the chance to meet a host sibling because you were mad that she's using your room. They will have fun without you and eat a delicious meal. But remember that she will always know you as the host brother who didn't want to come home and meet her because you were mad at the fact that your parents didn't ask your input before deciding to bring her into their home, and that's going to be her impression of American teenagers.", "INFO: What is your current level of financial support from your parents? Who paid for the plane ticket?", "NTA", "NTA\nIt seems strange to me that your keeping your room and your stuff you don't need to take to college wasn't the default assumption in this situation. Your attending college includes short term housing, which many (if not most) families view as \"being away\" rather than \"moved out.\" Yeah, you can't control your parents' decisions about their home. This decision changed your room from your familiar reliable soft landing place to a \"spare room\" that may have different occupants. \n\nWhat happened to your belongings that you expected to leave in your room? Did you, or they, move them? Are they still in that room, and available for any guest to use? Is there any place in their home where your belongings are stored and your privacy respected and protected?\n\nYour feelings and perspective are valid. I'd feel \"moved out\" by my parents. Even temporarily, your personal space in their home no longer exists. Whatever safety and security you felt for your room in your parents' home was erased by their decision to give it away AND by the calculated way it was sprung on you, so the expected push back would be minimized for them. It's normal that you didn't plan nor expect to be \"moved out\" of your small personal space in the home because you go to college. \n\nThey've made a series of decisions that have stripped you of the sense of belonging and security you had in their home. They now treat you as an extra visitor, to couch surf while a tenant occupies your former space. You have the right to choose not to participate in events and situations that feel bad.", "NTA\n\nIt might be useful to write your parents a letter explaining how you feel. I find this a useful tactic when dealing with conversations with people who may not be as open to hearing what one has to say. You can explain how you feel pushed aside, and how your objection comes from how they chose to communicate all of this to you. \n\nSo many issues on this sub are due to a break down in communication. Little rifts become big ones because no one is a mind reader. You are well within your right to not go home for Thanksgiving. But unless your parents understand their mistake, things will not get better.", "NTA, your mom is definitely brushing aside your feelings and then not contacting you for weeks, I can understand your resentment completely. The \"you are sleeping on the couch\" comment is especially rash.\n\nHowever, you are 18 and moved out for college.

So when your parents inevitably say or do something that annoys you, particularly if it\u2019s something relating to the exchange student, it\u2019s going to magnify your negative feelings and reactions and resentments. \n\nSo, I think it is quite wise to skip Thanksgiving.  But be prepared for them to complain about this during Christmas break.  Be ready to have a calm discussion with them about how you felt and explain it to them the way you did to us.  Your feelings of displacement are normal, even for an adult.", "ESH.\n\nYou've got jealousy issues.  You are not being replaced.  Your parents are doing a nice thing to help a student have a fuller experience during their one year in the country.  \n\nThat said, your parents should have told you they were going to do this privately, not in front of your friend.  They should have made an effort to find the student a different bedroom, or spoken with you about using your room in your absence.  They should have done better about being in contact.  They are probably struggling with you going off to college and wanted to fill that gap in their home.  Little do they know another teenager isn't the same, but it is kind of them to do what they are doing.\n\nHaving hosted 10 exchange students, I can confidently say the student also sucks in giving up on a perfectly fine host family so early in the game just because of transportation--a common theme among students who come from countries with better mass transit than ours.  Most kids would have given her rides and sounds like the host family was willing to help her out, she was just being spoiled.\n\nCalm down, don't go home for Thanksgiving if you don't want to, but chill.  This is a VERY temporary situation--the student will be gone by next summer and you and your family don't want to permanently damage your relationship just because you're a little jealous right now.", "You will probably end up marrying her lol.  But yeah, it's just a temporary thing so you should probably not get too upset about it.", "NTA, but your parents aren\u2019t either. It\u2019s normal to consider how to use space in a home after a child leaves. My room became a formal guest room about 5 minutes after I left for college. And I was only 45 minutes away. I respect your right to spend Thanksgiving as you choose though. And if being a guest in your own home doesn\u2019t feel good, go find the international crowd who doesn\u2019t go home,", "NTA. Personally, I\u2019d stay at school over Christmas too.", "I\u2019m going with NTA. But I think what\u2019s happening here is that both you and your parents are failing to understand the other\u2019s perspective. I can speak to this one as someone who once went through a similar situation, and as someone who is now many years on the other side of it. (In my case, my mom moved my brother into my room when I left for college, and out my stuff in his smaller room. Then once he graduated, she moved into a 2-bedroom condo\u2014while I was still in college\u2014leaving me, effectively, without a room to come back to.)\n\nI think what your parents (and mine) failed to see is how much we needed that sense of security and stability even as we were going off into the wider world. Like, everything else in your life is changing, so you still want that sense of having a home base to come back to when you\u2019re sad, or scared, or lonely. In allowing the exchange student to stay with them, they have taken away that feeling from you.\n\nBut from your parents\u2019 perspective: your room would be sitting empty for months while you were at school, and they had the space and the opportunity to do a favor for a friend of yours. They didn\u2019t need to ask your permission, because you wouldn\u2019t be there anyway! (Also, the whole \u201cit\u2019s our house, because we pay for it\u201d mentality may come into play.) Her presence is temporary. And maybe it is, in some ways, a means of distracting themselves from missing you. But in their minds, you\u2019re off stretching your wings and becoming an adult. To them, it\u2019s just a room. They aren\u2019t preventing you from coming home. They\u2019re still there, and your brother. But it doesn\u2019t make sense to displace this girl when you\u2019re only going to be using the room for a few days! \n\nI think the onus should be on your parents to have the emotional intelligence and maturity to realize how much this sense of displacement is hurting you. But you\u2019d be amazed at how many blind spots parents can have when it comes to their kids. My mom never got it either, and I didn\u2019t know how to explain it to her at the time. But my guess is that they never wanted you to feel like you\u2019re being replaced, nor are they actually trying to replace you. They\u2019re just trying to give you the space you need to grow away from them. What they don\u2019t realize is that you\u2019ve got space, but you need security.\n\nSo my suggestion is this: if you can, talk to them. Tell them how you\u2019re feeling. Focus on your emotions, rather than their actions. Don\u2019t be accusatory. Hopefully you can try to come to an understanding so you can come home for Thanksgiving. And if you can\u2019t\u2026I get it. Again, parents\u2019 blind spots can be HUGE, and if yours are anything like mine they may become defensive. (That\u2019s why you should focus on your emotions and not their actions.) But I think it\u2019s worth trying to resolve this before Thanksgiving, and figuring out if there\u2019s a way you can spend the weekend at home without it fueling anger or resentment. \n\nGood luck!", "Yup. A week after I'd moved out, every sign I'd had a place in my parents house was scrubbed away. It... okay, yeah, they could do whatever, it was their house. I get that. But I won't deny that my feelings about it are... complex even more than a decade and a half later. And, yeah, it absolutely changed how I looked at them.", "Wait a minute...\n\n...you just made me realize OP has a brother.\n\nINFO:  OP, why wouldn't you be sleeping on a decent air mattress in your brother's room????\n\nThere are twin air mattresses out there now that are super quiet, and they work all night evening out your weight.  They are amazing.  You could check Amazon, find one reasonably priced, and send it to your home address.", "My husband and I both went through what you went through. Now we have 2 college aged kids. We sold the 3 bedroom house and bought a 5 bedroom with 5 baths so that our kids will always have a bedroom and their own bathrooms to come home to whenever they want. Perhaps we overcompensated a bit because of our own trauma, but I have no regrets. The other two bedrooms are a guest room and a study.", "May i ask how the relationship is with your parents now?", "My parents busted through the wall my bedroom shared with their bathroom and turned both rooms into their master bath.

I personally do not know any parents in my circle who do either. Kids come HOME on breaks.

This isn\u2019t so much about the physical room in the house. It\u2019s about the emotional room in the house. \n\nIt\u2019s about them giving his room to someone else without even having a proper conversation about it. \n\nIt\u2019s about them suddenly not calling and checking in like they normally would.\n\nIt\u2019s about them not caring to hear his feelings or opinions on the matter and brushing them off repeatedly. \n\nIt\u2019s about the way they minimize his feelings and treat him like he\u2019s wrong for having said feelings. \n\nIt\u2019s about him feeling they *replaced* him.

When I visited my parents a couple months ago I stayed in my old room that became his old room that has now become a guest room. His old room is kinda just storage for our crap we haven't sorted through yet. There's a bed under all the junk somewhere, and next year when we're both there at the same time I'll probably let him have my old room during the day, because he'll be working remote. I'll need it at night because I'll be working remote, but EU hours. We'll both sleep in his first room or the living room or whatever my dad decides, because it stopped being my house like a decade ago, and brother's 7ish years ago. \n\nLike, sure, would be cool to have my room preserved like a tiny museum to 17 year old me, but they kept all my stuff, which is more than some get, and ultimately it made no sense for him to keep using the smaller, worse room for 3 years when mine was empty. Plus mine had the better window for sneaking out of, and was further from the centre of the echoey open plan house. He'd have been in there all the time anyway to study or whatever. like he was before I left.\n\nThat said, in OPs situation I feel like it's NAH or possibly parents are TA, purely because of the way they communicated. But all I see is them saying what's going on in their house/their lives as a way of update, not asking permission, because it's not his anymore. Like, maybe a warning to move your stuff if there's anything you wanted to keep private or whatever, but if it wasn't important enough to take with you, it'll be fine in storage for a bit.", "This is what I was thinking too, I'm honestly surprised to see so many disagree.

She's gone when he gets back during winter break. He's getting his room back. It was never permanent.", "He was feeling replaced from the get go. Yet back in September he was still planning on going home for Thanksgiving. The pivot point in this entire thing is his mom's teasing. I agree in the validity of his feelings. That was a shitty dig. But why can't he have an adult conversation with his mom on that? \n\nI'm speculating but ops relationship with his parents seems pretty good other than this one event.

The parents being pretty rude about it is a separate issue.  The Iranian yogurt is not the problem.", "The situation is a pretty spot-on analog, IMO. He moved out, his parents got rid of his room or used it for something else (in this case for *someone* else). That's their right, and something that's bound to happen for families that don't have disposable space. His parents could have handled the delivery better, gotten his opinion, etc. and that makes them TA here. Still doesn't seem worth potentially severing bonds with your parents over.

Annoying, but I WASN'T LIVING THERE so it made sense to me, and wasn't permanent.  And even if it was permanent, there was an expectation that after high school (and they generously paid for college and most costs associated with that) we were responsible for figuring out how to be adults and that they were there for support anytime but it might look different.  30 years later, that exchange student is a permanent member of our family - she and I are carpooling to mom's for Thanksgiving next week.  \n\nThings change.

There is nothing particularly weird or wrong about telling you about an exchange student moving into your room over dinner while you had a friend over; it's not a particularly sensitive conversation, after all. There probably was no conspiracy to hide this from you until just before you left; either they had just decided it or they just assumed you would be fine with it. You say your parents didn't call you once a week and you expected them to, but you had moved out for the first time, and unless you had specifically agreed they would call once a week it doesn't seem outrageous for them to think you were OK with texting them and calling them when you decided to. You say the exchange student will have left by Christmas break, so you not having your old room available is only really a problem if you're back for the weekend or Thanksgiving, not for weeks or months of holidays. And finally, you're belittling her desire to move closer to school, when in reality needing others to give you a ride to go anywhere is a pretty big deal for the social life and mood of a teenager.\n\nFor what it's worth, I still have my old room available at my parents' place a decade after I moved out. However, I had to sleep on a spare mattress in my sister's room when I came back and someone else (my sister's friend, my grandmother, my cousin etc.) was staying in my room, and it's not like I had to give permission.

They now live in a 2 bedroom house that is small enough that their kids can\u2019t actually all visit at the same time. (For context, money is not an issue and they had 4-5 bedroom houses before this)\n\nMy parents were planning on moving into a new house for some time and wanted either the same size (3 bedroom, I am the oldest of 2) or bigger so that when we got married and had kids we could come back and easily visit for holidays. They ended up in a 4 bedroom with a bonus room that can be used if necessary and for thanksgiving my husband and I will be visiting, my brother still lives at home, my grandma will be staying, and two of my cousins are staying over.\n\nMy mother keeps a room ready for us (not my childhood room, just a guest room) so that I, or any other family, can visit at the drop of a hat! We feel welcome, so we visit more often!!\n\nI keep a guest room for the same reason!", "I dream of being able to do the same. It was such a stark moment in my life when I moved into my dorm and my mom said I could never come back, since I was now an adult. That moment is cemented in the back of mind, and the insecurities that stemmed from that core moment are have led to some really poor life situations. You and your husband sound like thoughtful parents.", "I told my son that his room is his until he says it's not.", "Why should OP spend money to be somewhere that they don't feel welcome?", "You're right.  It is not his house.  It was his home.  See the difference?", "It has also been his home for his entire life. Just because he doesn't own the house doesn't mean that he isn't entitled to have feelings about his spaces being given to a stranger the minute he left for college, his parents barely keeping in contact, or being told that he would have to sleep on the couch if he wanted to come for Thanksgiving.\n\nParents can suck it up for one holiday.", "Then he can spend 1 holiday away from them? The math adds up", "It\u2019s not about the room. It\u2019s about parents who take kids for granted and do whatever they want to do. Yes it\u2019s their house and yes it\u2019s their room. But they are also OPs parents who choosing to prioritise a random girl whom they hardly know to their son who just left home for college.", "I kind of feel like until the child has their own independence it's the child's room.", "So because it's in the parents house,  they should disregard that it is the space that their own child had been staying in for likely most of his life? Just because the room \"is free and the child doesn't own it,\" does that mean it shouldn't be respected as OP's space? Providing a private space within their house is the job of the parent and that child's space should be respected.", "He didn\u2019t move out tho? He\u2019s away to college? He even admits that if asked he would have said yes. But he wasn\u2019t asked. They just did what they wanted without consulting him. They just sprang that on him in front of company and didn\u2019t allow him to react.", "By telling him at the last minute before he left for school they have him no opportunity to make accommodations for his things that he previously would have thought would be fine left in his room at home.  I agree that if you move out you don't retain rights to your room at home forever.  I would argue that his bed and other furniture were things he probably reasonably considered \"his\" but have now been given to someone else.   Had OP been consulted he may have had time to arrange something but his parents had not just given his room away but his bed as well.   That's the part that stepped over a line IMO and makes OP NTA.", "Going to school isn\u2019t really moving out the same way.

He hasn't moved out yet, that's his room where he sleeps (or WOULD sleep) when he comes home between semesters until he moves out on his own. You're making a huge exaggeration to take \"please don't give my room away until I've finished college and moved out\" to \"you can NEVER change my room EVER\"", "His parents chose to have a kid, and by doing so, gave him domain over his childhood bedroom. It\u2019s inconsiderate to not consult him beforehand, especially because it sounds like if he had been asked, he would have been more open to it.

I am not surprised you guys feel the way you do.", "This may be a surprising concept, but parents have lives, too. Are parents supposed to live in suspended animation for the 9 months their adult college kids are away, leaving the home completely unchanged for their periodic, brief return visits?\n\nI rented out the house after my kids left for college and bounced around. When they returned for breaks, I included them in whatever accommodation I was in, which usually meant being a little creative and sharing rooms, etc. It's been fun, my kids think I'm more interesting than most parents. For us, it's turned out that home is just being together, it's not a building.", "Yeah, I feel like communication is key here.\n\nWhen I went to college my mom decided to get rid of the house and rent a 1 bedroom because it was wildly cheaper and I slept on the couch. When I was finished with the mandatory dorm year, I rented an apartment (also way cheaper than the dorms) and then got to host my family, and didn\u2019t have to go through the nightmare that is traveling for the holidays lol. Win-win.\n\nMaybe everyone in these comments are just very wealthy or something? I would never expect my parents to pay to keep an empty room for me that I barely use while also paying for my very expensive education lol? That is a weird/very privileged perspective to me\u2026", "I think that\u2019s fair, but in that situation, you\u2019re just as unable to host your children as you are any guest. My lean towards parents being TA here is that I suspect OP is being treated differently than a guest. If a relative or friend visited, I suspect the parents would offer them a bed rather than insist they sleep on the couch or consider that the expectation.\n\nWhen the child lives with you, it would be understandable to expect their room to be the one offered up for a guest (although my parents never made me do this). But OP does not live with them, does not have a room at their house, and is now the guest himself. It\u2019s like he\u2019s getting the worst of both worlds. Imo if he\u2019s not a resident there but now a guest, he should be afforded the courtesy of a guest", "Sigh me too. I remember when my sister left for college- my mother was seriously depressed,  not helped by them quitting lifetime smoking habits around then. Parents who make their lives about their children have a difficult time adjusting when their children leave the nest, whereas OP is experiencing independence and seems to want them to remain on pause until he returns. Hopefully he realizes this is a healthy and productive way for his parents to manage this buffer time period, and goes home to welcome their temporary visitor.", "Similar here. They decided to turn my room into the guest bedroom when I was a freshman in high school. The other spare room was an office workout room. I lived there full time. I left home at 17 and have no contact with my family.", "I just wish I had a picture of their expressions when it happened.", "Those sadly are IMO usually the same parents who when they need help when get older demand you come home or that they move in with you. In those situations I would consider sending nice brochures for retirement homes with the reminder that they were the ones who said adults can never come back.", "I feel like kids who know they have a safe place to come home to feel better leaving honestly. Jumping out of the nest isn\u2019t nearly as scary if you know it will be there if you come back.", "It never even occurred to me that it needed saying when my son left for college. Of course it's his room. Or now, more accurately, \\*their\\* room since he lives with his fiance and she can use the room whenever she wants--with or without him.

My old bedroom in my parents house was their property, and when i visited i rotated between that room, the spare bedroom, or the couch or a mattress on the floor if the rest of the house was full of other guests.\n\nMany college towns have a summer semester, so finding a short term summer lease is reasonable. Many students leave campus for jobs elsewhere, so occupancy in off-campus apartments in my 40K Big Ten university town was something like 30 %. Summer leases are relatively cheap as a result, some rental income is better than zero income.", "I know my school *would* let you stay in dorms for winter and summer break if you requested it, they would keep one dorm open and consolidate all of the remaining students into that. \n\nBut also where I went to school, getting an apartment was like a third of the price of the dorms anyway, so getting a short term apartment was pretty common.", "Yeah it would be different.

As an adult you should be thankful not demanding. Would be a very different story if OP was still a literal child but that is not the case here. And damn there are plenty of children who are not properly taken care of and plenty of young adults who would be damn grateful for the help. Being inconvenienced for a single holiday?

It is difficult to be in her position and feel like a burden constantly.\n\nAlso, it may not really be about the distance from school--something may have happened with the previous family that your parents are not allowed to tell you. Most host families are great but sometimes students do need to be moved on short notice because of issues with a host.\n\nTry to have a bit more compassion for the exchange student because there may be something going on in her life that you are not aware of. \n\nI would suggest going home and trying to get to know the exchange student at Thanksgiving.

I was erased in a way but it felt like they just wanted me there as part of their \"perfect happy family\" image. They just wanted my physical self there but for me to suppress all of my actual personhood. It was like being a living picture in a frame.

They're in a very small town, they've lived there all their adult lives, all their friends live within 5 minutes of their house, my sister's grave is nearby. According to them, they're only leaving that house in a casket. So, as they'll never sell that house, I don't see how turning the spare bedrooms into storage rooms or whatever parents do with them would help anything. All that would do is make us uncomfortable when we visit, especially my sister as she takes my nephew to see his grandparents at least 2 weekends a month.\n\nAs far as they're concerned, that's not just a house, that's the family home which we'll inherit one day and we all have a say in what's happening to it.

We went through our childhood stuff, kept what we wanted, got rid of the rest and then redecorated each room to suit adults rather than kids. Now we stay there when we visit with our partners/families. \n\nNo one was chucked out the minute they turned 18 and went to university. Students still need somewhere to go for at least 3 months of the year, and we never had to worry about where we'd sleep. We were treated well by having our spaces and privacy respected.

A small town where everyone owns enormous (seriously, 4 bedrooms?) houses and doesn't need to use half of them. \n\nI never said anything about moving or selling. But lots of people repurpose their kids rooms into craft rooms, guest rooms, etc. You can keep your possessions at home without needing to have your childhood bedroom made up like you still live there. \n\nI also see absolutely nothing disrespectful in having one's bedroom changed.
