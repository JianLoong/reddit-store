She met her husband three years later. He was a widower with a 7 month old son (I think he was 7 months old when they met). She instantly moved them in and started claiming his son as her own and raising him like us. She got engaged to him and a few weeks before the wedding our dad died. By this point my mom had just become estranged from her entire extended family. She told my dad's parents that if they wanted to see us again soon, they would need to come to her wedding and watch all three of us (including my stepbrother). She then told them after the wedding that going forward if they wanted to see us, or spend time with us, they had to include him. They hadn't wanted to. They tried to argue for time with just us. Offering to pay for it all 100%. But mom said no. She said they needed to come to the house and make an effort with all three and not just take two with them.\n\nMy sister and I would argue with mom over one day in particular. My dad's birthday. We celebrated that every year with dad's family after he died, but she wouldn't even let that day be just us and them. Our stepbrother had to be there. She said they did not get to be just our family and we shouldn't see him as any less deserving of being present. But we did. He was not our dad's kid, and had never met him. So why was he deserving of being there? I never got that. She called us selfish for the mindset.\n\nLast year I turned 18 and I moved in with my girlfriend. Once I left home, my stepbrother was no longer invited to anything to do with my dad's family. He no longer saw them. My sister and I also stopped spending any time at mom's house. Then we stopped speaking to them at all. It was quiet for several months and then last week mom showed up where I work and demanded we talk. She told me how she was tired of one of her kids being left out and how sick was it to discard him that way, and why weren't my sister and I advocating for him. I told her she only had one kid, her stepson, and that my sister and I were no longer her kids and my family were no longer forced to include him to see us and that it was all her fault for forcing it in the first place. Then I wished her luck, which was kinda sarcastic not gonna lie, and then asked her to leave. She texted me later that night to say she had been a good mom to all three of us and to say she only had one kid was low.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1667826936, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yomjy5/aita_for_telling_my_mom_she_only_has_one_kid/", "score": 15991, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I 100 percent agree with you on the permanent cutting of ties with toxic mom.", "Say it louder!  I have cut toxic family out of my life and constantly hear shit like \"you need to stop with the hate in your heart\", or \"I cannot believe you are doing this to them\".  Um, I don't hate.  I nothing them.  I am not doing anything to them, I am literally doing the opposite.  I am keeping myself sane.", "It also makes it look like opportunism \u2014 she took advantage of her ex\u2019s death to exploit her control of their children. She wouldn\u2019t have been able to do what she did if her ex hadn\u2019t died, but it otherwise didn\u2019t change her living situation at all.", "Perhaps Mum was trying to compensate then", "Lots of older kids dote on younger relatives.", "Yes, he is the AH for not standing up to his wife.", "And imagine, apparently some people said this kid is an asshole.

His stepmother created the poor relationships with her bio children by forcing him on the grandparents (not related to him in any way) with her \u201call or none\u201d stance and not letting her children honor their father without including someone who never met their father. She guaranteed they would never be close.", "Ugh. This right here. The nerve of her to call OP \u201csick\u201d for wanting to leave the stepbrother at home. A big part of getting through grief is to stay close with those who are going through the Same or a similar loss. Shame on her for threatening to cut off their support system on this issue!", "It is brutal. Its bad enough we lost our daughter at a young age but in a sense we also lost our grandson but I feel we will prevail in court,", "And they may very well have become family without forcing it.  But she did, and she needs to own it.", "You are correct. I'm in a weird situation where the father of my boys passed away prior to me coming into the picture so no split custody with the kids and we looked into a guardianship in case anything were to happen to their mom the boys would stay with me so there wouldn't be any fight over who was going to get them.", "On top of that he had to wonder if he was loved by Smom, and his dad who was willing to let him go and not have alone time.  Just a pawn to his parents.", "It seems the \"family\" only went 1 way. It would make sense that if their grandparents had to accept step brother, then step brothers grandparents would need to accept them. But there is actually no mention of stepdad, his parents or his deceased wife's parents or family. \nAlso it is implied that neither OP nor their sister were allowed 1 on 1 time with their grandparents. Which makes me guess they maybe were parentified in regards to their step sibling", "Given how quickly he moved on to a new woman. After his wife died. He was probably just looking for a wife to take care of his kid and didn't want to rock the boat.", "My guess is he married her so she would do all the work of raising his son. His son wasn\u2019t even a year old so he was a widower less than a year when he moved her in. That screams of built in nanny. I would even bet he cheats on her unless she\u2019s that beautiful but since her inside isn\u2019t at all beautiful, her outside won\u2019t be enough ti keep him faithful.", "Sorry! I raised them so I always refer to them as my twins! They are my youngest siblings :)", "I will never understand why some people really do NOT grasp that their children/step children are NOT their exes family. Was it harsh what you said? Sure. Did she have it coming? Yes.", "Totally NTA \n\nYour mom not only destroyed your relationship with her but also your stepbrother I'm sure is super confused and hurt that what he thought of as his \"family\" now wants nothing to do with him. I'm sure he's waaayy more hurt now than if the mom had just explained to him that your dad's family is separate from his family and if a relationship naturally developed then it would have been so much better. She has no one to blame but herself on how it went down.", "Nta.\n\nOut of curiosity, why did your parents divorce?", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA, you'd have to be very brainwashed or sumthn to not see it. u/beingsydneycarton makes a good points.", "NTA. Your mom\u2019s obsession with shoe-horning a child everyone\u2019s life is what caused this.

Your mum is a jerk xx I\u2019m so sorry", "NTA Definitely NTA", "NTA. He should not have been included in anything related to your dad's family. Your mom is lucky that they did, but they or you don't have to now.", "Nta. Her stepson had 2 sets of grandparents already from his own parents. So why was she forcing this child onto her ex husband's parents? It's madness she would send him for your dada birthday, the step brother was not related to your dad in anyway.", "NTA It's harsh to say, but the truth is harsh. She essentially blackmailed her former family into taking along this boy they had no ties to, and refused to allow you and them to any time to be there without him. On top of that, you were 7 and 8 years older than the boy and essentially she forced the family into taking care of a baby, which likely meant you had to do it. She also created a situation that was destined to hurt the boy since anybody could predict that they'd cut ties as soon as possible and he'd be left wondering why. Forcing him on you and them prioritized him over you every. single. time. You didn't matter as much as he did. So now you have no interest in a relationship with him or her. Color me not surprised.", "NTA.  Your mom has made some terrible decisions.  That being said, I feel sorry for stepbrother.  Her actions bred an environment where he was hated and resented. That's a shame.", "NTA. She tried to force her view of the family on everybody, and I guess she's found out how well that didn't work. \n\nIt's sad, and I imagine your stepbrother doesn't exactly feel amazing about it, but that's on his dad and his stepmother, sounds like...", "NTA ignore all the YTA they are gross.

Now she's paying the consequences from ignoring and manipulating you, your sister, and your grandparents.", "NTA, and ouch, this one's heavy.\n\nI get why she wanted to have the stepbrother included - it was probably actually well-intentioned, but terribly, terribly misguided. She then proceeded to f\\*ck up everything else in a way that was just cruel to you, your sister, and your extended family.\n\nI'd probably just block her number, that's the best bet, but I would be so tempted to respond to the last text with something like \"A good mom? If you were even a passable mom to sis and I we wouldn't be in this position, would we? You should seek professional help to deal with your delusions of adequacy.\"  \n\nDon't do that though, it's petty and doesn't do any good. Just cut her out of your life.", "NTA - Question, why didn\u2019t your mother spend time alone with step-brother while you were with your grandparents? Also, why didn\u2019t step-dad put a stop to his kid going to your father\u2019s family\u2019s home?", "NTA. I don\u2019t see why I saw some comments say you\u2019re the AH. She forced the stepchild into your father\u2019s side of the family despite said stepchild not even knowing him. Also, her manipulating your dad\u2019s side of the family into letting your step-sibling go to events w you and your sister in order to see you guys was a low blow.

I would consider a restraining order due to the fact that she harassed you at work.", "Blending implies some level of integration. She was grafting these families", "This was my first thought- she wanted a day off, lol. OP is NTA.", "Yea true, plus she seemed so determined to have her stepson be \"treated the same\" as her own kids by others who aren't even related to him I honestly wouldn't be surprised if she would have tried it if OPs father was alive. It would probably be like if OPs dad wanted to take OP and his sister on holiday somewhere it would be \"your taking OP and his sister on holiday? Then you have to take stepson too so it's fair\".", "NTA\n\nI can understand wanting to create a blended family with all children considered siblings & treated equally. \n\nI can understand OP's mother quickly forming a maternal bond with a motherless infant. (It seems inevitable considering she had to take on most parental responsibility.)\n\nI can admit it's at least possible that OP's mother was motivated by good intentions. Which makes her treatment of ex-in-laws & bio children even more puzzling - especially as it went on for years! \n\nSome facts I consider important: \n\n# OP's parents were divorced for 3 years (approx) before his death & her remarriage.\n\n# After divorce from their son, OP's mother no longer considered ex-in-laws to be her family. Access to grandchildren would have been arranged via their son (OP's father)\n\n# OPs suggests mother's motivation to include ex-in-laws in 'blended family' was self-serving - None of the other grandparent options were willing and/or able to take on an active role. Her ex-in-laws were the only ones with potential to be useful.\n\n# OP's father had been dead for less than 2 weeks when mother approached her grieving ex-in-laws. But NOT to reassure them they'd still get access to their grandchildren. Instead making it clear she held control to grant or deny access and that she could/would set the terms of any visitation. \n\n# OP states his mother did NOT adopt stepbrother. It's unclear what her actual legal parental rights/responsibilities were for her stepson. \n\n# OPs mother did NOT supervise all (if any) of her children's visitations with their paternal grandparents. Her ex-in-laws would collect children, have unsupervised visitation and later return children to mother.\n\nOPs stepbrother was very young at the time of their parents marriage. His step-siblings were 8 & 9. An age difference which made it ridiculous to claim all 3 had exact same needs & must be treated 'equally'.\n\nStepbrother's *exclusion* existed at this point solely in the mind of OP's mother. It only become an issue if adult chose to make it one. \n\nIf children's wellbeing was truly her main concern she'd have welcomed the opportunity for quality 1-1 time with her stepson while her older children were with their grandparents. \n\nBut not only did she decide stepbrother must be included in any & all visitations - she made it an ultimatum which her ex-in-laws MUST accept in order to ever see grandchildren. She asserted her power & control.\n\nHer ex-in-laws were grieving their son's death and two children were grieving the loss of a father. All four were extremely vulnerable at this heartbreaking time. Not knowing if (or when) they'd be able to see eachother again could only add to their pain.\n\nShe could have reached out to offer solace to her ex-in-laws. Or to seek a source of comfort for her grieving children. Instead she chose to make demands & offer ultimatums. All so she could regularly offload her young stepson onto people who were essentially strangers to him.", ">She texted me later that night to say she had been a good mom to all three of us and to say she only had one kid was low.\n\n\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\n\nIn what universe was your mom a good mom to all three of you?

I find it hilarious parents will treat their children horribly and still expect them to be around as adults", "Mom: *tramples boundaries* why are you and your sister excluding me and your step brother?!\n\nOP: Because you trampled over our boundaries and tried to force a relationship at the expense of erasing our dad. Also, we\u2019re not your kids, step brother is your only kid.\n\nMom: *surprised pikachu, even though she found your work and started harassing you there which is literally trampling over your boundaries again*\n\nNTA Op.

A guy he never met. A guy that divorced his step mother before he was born. The step brother HAS an active father in his life\u2026 \n\nI could understand the mother wanting her kids to include the boy. But her dead ex husbands family?", "Sweetheart, humans ARE migraines!

They do not seem to have the life experience to understand what it's like to be the adult child who was traumatized, neglected and abused!"]}
