{"id": 19020, "submission_id": "141acr2", "title": "AITA for moving back furniture that was rearranged without my permissions?", "selftext": "Alt account for privacy. My wife and 2 kids and I live far away from both of our families - like, 6-9 hour flight far. The grandparents visit several times a year, usually a few weeks at a time. We get along well with all of them, tho there is tension between my wife and her mom & stepdad more than the others. She does, however, like their decorating taste, so she often rearranges stuff at our house when they're around. (It's led a fight before when she sorta used them to do stuff I explicitly said I didn't want, but we're over that now.) Our general agreement is that I manage my family and she manages hers, so we don't put each other in awkward situations of fighting with the other's parents. \n\nLast time they were here, my wife and I took a multiday trip, since the only time we can do anything without the kids is when grandparents are visiting. After we came back, my in-laws had rearranged a few things in the house, of which one really made me angry. Our kitchen/dining/living room is an open space in the shape of a rectangle, except with a corner \"cut off,\" so it really has 5 sides. I had our living room rug placed so it was aligned with the 4 major walls, because that way all the kids' play areas were soft. Because the kids mess with it and because toys kept getting under it and tripping people, I used loads of double-sided tape to get the rug where I wanted it - I mean, it was clamped down hard. \n\nHowever, the couch is along the angled wall, and apparently they didn't like that the rug was at an angle to it, so they removed it, including all the tape, and angled it so it is aligned with the couch and nothing else. There were gaps where the kids play (so it's colder & harder), and one corner reached into the dining room, so the chairs constantly snag on it and people spill food or drink in that area. They said (as they always do) \"oh if you don't like it you can move it back.\" Thanks for giving me a few hours of work, but I didn't say anything then. (My wife didn't comment, but that could mean she didn't want a fight with them...or with me.)\n\nBefore they left, they took a day trip with my wife and the kids while I had some work to do. Once I finished I realized that the only time I'll have the house empty for a few hours is now, so I moved all the furniture off, realigned the rug, and placed it where I wanted it. When they came back they were upset that I had changed it back, and my wife was mad at me for doing it while they were still in town. She agreed that there would never be a time to do it when they're not but said it could wait until the next grandparents visit us (which hasn't been scheduled yet, so it's probably months away).  \n\nI think I was entitled to take my ILs on the offer to put it back if I didn't like it, since they did this without asking and it was clear from the mass of tape that I didn't put the rug there lightly, but AITA for not waiting until they were gone?", "created_utc": 1685961746, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/141acr2/aita_for_moving_back_furniture_that_was/", "score": 1638, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Rearranging someone else\u2019s house without their consent is unbelievably rude.  Like, on the \u201cwho the hell does that?\u201d level of rude.  They\u2019ve got no right to be upset that you\u2019re restoring your house to the way *you* like it.  They don\u2019t live there and it should be set up in the way that the actual residents of the house want it.  All you did was highlight exactly how rude they were being.", "Hard NTA\n\nYou took them at their word.  They said you could put it back if you wanted to. I would have said something like... you lied to me?  You said I could put it back if I didn't like it and you lied to me?  This was not the truth?  (Let them explain themselves out of that mess)\n\nIt is beyond rude to rearrange the house when you are only a guest. You were full within your rights to take them up on their \"offer\".  It is so presumptuous as a guest to move furniture, and then to say you can move it back, as if you need their permission. What planet are the from?  They sound like aliens who know nothing of earth culture and common sense.", "Obviously NTA\n\nYour in laws feel too entitled to your home and your wife needs to put a stop to this nonsense ASAP. She needs to be on your side and should have said something to her parents the moment you came home and saw the change. If she is not there to make a stand with you then nothing will change and they will look at you as the irrational one.", "NTA. As someone with OCD, my response would be *nowhere* as level-headed as yours. Instant stressor and I would be absolutely livid. If I have something somewhere, it is there for a reason!\n\nAnd hey, they said you could move it back. They have no right to complain about this considering they moved everything around without permission in the first place. However, I think it would be worth explaining to your ILs \"hey, the rug is this way *for a reason* because the kids play there.\" Hopefully explaining the set up to them will prevent them from doing this in the future", "NTA\n\nI would kick anyone out of my house that took it upon themselves to rearrange my furniture. I don't care if it's my wife's parents. Who the hell do they think they are? That's completely unacceptable.", "NTA of course you should have changed it back, the masses of tape were a hint and a half that the rug was meant to be at that angle. How rude and arrogant to think they know better than you about your own home.\n\nGood lord imagine having enough free time to rearrange other people\u00b4s houses every time you visit, they need to play animal crossing or something so they can build their own little island and arrange things", "NTA.  You\u2019re in-law\u2019s behavior was both rude and presumptuous.  They had no right to rearrange your home to their tastes without consulting anyone.  You had every right to put it back the way you had it.  And there was no need to spare a thought for their feelings on the matter, because they didn\u2019t bother sparing a thought for yours.", ">They said (as they always do) \"oh if you don't like it **you** can move it back.\" \n\nThis would tick me off.   How nice of them to tell you that you can fix your own home the way you like.  It was the way you liked it before they moved things around without your consent.  And now the onus is on you to undo their handywork. \n\nNTA.  Your wife has to tell her parents not to do any reorganizing of anything without prior consent.", "NTA, you live there, therefore they should ask you before rearranging", "NTA. You really need to start enforcing some boundaries with these people. \n\nAlso, and this doesn't affect my verdict, what do you mean you wouldn't be able to move it back until the other Grandparents visit? Is it not possible for the kids to play elsewhere for a couple hours or do it when they're out/in bed?", "NTA. The gall of those people\u2026.", "NTA.  Who the hell rearranges the furniture in someone else's house?  Especially without permission, WTF.", "NTA but I think you should have talked to them or your wife to stop rearranging.", "NTA but it shouldn't have escalated to this stage. Your wife should have nipped this in the bud a while back. Guests offering input is fine but straight up rearranging is not ok.", "NTA.  They are so rude.   I be petty and start moving things at their house -  oh I rearranged all your kitchen cabinets - good luck finding stuff!", "NTA they are for moving your furniture around pulling up your rug. That\u2019s just not ok.", "NTA\n\nThat is INSANE though, that is YOUR living space and you clearly put thought into it, if it was a minor thing that can easily be moved around? Sure, who cares ya know, but something you taped down with purpose like that?? Even worse is that they complained about you taking them up on that offer??? You can (re)decorate your house at any time given, the fact that your wife didnt jump in to defend you is also kinda wild, especially with the \"everyone takes care of their own family\" thing", "NTA. \n\nWho goes to someone's house, as a guest, and just helps themselves to rearranging the space without permission??? That is poor guest etiquette. And I'm sure they wouldn't appreciate it if you went to their house and did that. So, I'm not sure why they feel they have the right to do it in your space. \n\nYou have every right to put the place back the way it was, the way YOU want it, in YOUR own house. haha. And they don't really get to be upset if you do. It's not their place. I do think, though, that your wife should speak to them about it, since that is the agreement you two have (her responsible for her parents, you for yours) to express boundaries. Though, I'm not sure why they even need a conversation to let them know this behavior is not okay...  \n\n\nAnyway....haha.", "You're NTA. It is **your home, not theirs** and it is ridiculous that they're pulling the wounded feelings card on you for putting your own living room back together as you had it. If anything, it is incredibly rude on their part to alter someone else's furnishings.", "\u201cOh, if you don\u2019t like it you can move it back\u201d.\n\nOk, done. NTA", "So, like, they should absolutely not have moved it- and the rug clearly doesn\u2019t fit the space when arranged \u201caligned\u201d.\n\nAlso it sounds like the wife doesn\u2019t disagree with the arrangement, just didn\u2019t want to spark a fight. Which absolutely would happen the next time they come to visit.\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonally I\u2019d have handed them a fresh roll of tape and made them put it back. As it stands\u2026 NTA", "NTA. The best way for them to not get annoyed with you undoing their changes to your home, is for them to simply not change anything without discussing with you beforehand.", "NTA. What they did - they claimed your home as theirs to do whatever they please. So rude. And they are even disappointed seeing everything back!", "I'm thinking ESH, your in laws for thinking they had any right to re-arrange things without permission, your wife for telling you you should have waited, and you for (apparently) not letting your wife have any say in the way your (and her!) house is decorated.", "You are certainly well within your rights to arrange your furniture however you choose but I\u2019m finding it very hard to believe you couldn\u2019t wait until they left. You apparently were able to put everything back by yourself in a very short amount of time & your IL\u2019s had no problem moving things when kids were at home. So maybe it wouldn\u2019t have been that challenging to just hold off until they left. Perhaps you had another reason for not waiting? \n\nThey annoyed you, so you annoyed them. You\u2019re even now. If your wife never explained to her parents that you didn\u2019t appreciate them constantly rearranging your stuff \u2014 they probably know now. Hopefully.... hopefully, that\u2019s the end of it. \n\nESH\n\neta", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

They have proved that they can\u2019t be trusted. Visitors are two yeses, one no.", "I agree - but also, there's A LOT of I.... I....

She rearranges my furniture and decor every time she visits. The funniest time was when she was helping us move in to our last house. She moved a picture of our family to put a picture of my sister in law on her quince\u00f1era front and center on our mantle. It was the most prominent thing up there. I pointed it out to my husband and he went immediately and put our family photo back up. Sure enough, the next day she moved the photo of my sister in law back again. \n\nThe time that made me the most upset was the most recent time. My mom passed away 10 years ago. I have a small urn of her ashes and a few of her things set up together as a kind of little shrine. It\u2019s nothing you\u2019d look at and think was decor, a pair of her glasses, a pin she liked, a cheapy little bracelet she liked, etc. They were all set up in a shelf. My husband and I don\u2019t have family that live close so when they visit we try to get a date in. We went to the movies and when we came home the shelves were all rearranged and all of my mom\u2019s things were taken off. I\u2019m sure she didn\u2019t realize what they were but for fuck sake. Just don\u2019t touch my shit. It took me days to find where she put everything but I finally put it all back. It", "NTA. You said your wife has problems with his stepmom & dad, so this may have been just a way for them to push her buttons. By you putting everything back how it was shows that you have her back. She was probably mad that you didn't wait till they left because she had to hear about it for the rest of their visit.", "Thank you!!! Finally!!! Finally *someone* is saying what I was thinking all along!!! \nFirst off, wtf is it with their entitled attitude that HE can move it if he doesn't like it??? \nThe mere fact that they feel entitled and comfortable to even move things without their consent!!! \nAnd if you REALLY wanted to push it after being fucking rude and moving things that don't belong to you, in a house that's not yours, you BETTER return it back to exactly how it was before they come back?? \n\nI would never in my wildest dreams, even think if moving and rearranging IL's house!! Unless there was furniture that was seriously in the way and I was staying for a long time!! It's just unfathomable!! \nAnd the audacity they had to tell HIM to revert back to something that THEY changed!!! No THEY must change it back! How dare they put work into hands like that??? The audacity!!!", "Not only that, but the sheer audacity of giving someone \"permission\" to move their own furniture, in their own home, is absolutely wild. The disrespect is insane. That is not a conversation that would have gone well for them in my home.", "Nah they shouldn\u2019t even try to rearrange someone else\u2019s home period, idc if they ask permission. If they think something might be helpful they can make suggestions. That\u2019s it.", "Wait, how is OP wrong to move their own furniture back to where it had originally been?", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

Probably rearrange the refrigerator too.  But I'm pretty vindictive if you come to MY house and move stuff around.", "I would still argue that it should be set up the way they want it. Regardless of whether or not they actually use it that way, it's still their house, and their wants come first.", "A good friend from college rearranged my kitchen cabinets and told me, \"Since you're so short, now you can reach everything easily!\" I just responded, \"Knucklehead, put everything back where you got it from.

What would drive me nuts though is that we often would host for holiday meals since we had the room to entertain my hubby\u2019s/in-laws\u2019 larger family and my SIL and MIL help by doing the dishes and cleanup. But then they put things in the cupboards where I don\u2019t usually put them and then I can\u2019t find anything for weeks. Hubs would then claim I did it to aggravate him and I would point out it was his mom who put things elsewhere, what purpose would it serve me to suddenly put something somewhere else after two years? I\u2019m not the type to \u201cprank\u201d in that form either.", "THIS! Like OP even needed permission to move things in his own home! Insanity.", "This response is why I actually think this is a mild ESH.\n\nYour In-Laws: are definitely AHs here. You don't re-arrange someone else's space without explicit permission from both parties.\n\nYou: It is perfectly justified to feel violated that your in-laws moved things without your permission, but also remember that these people just took care of your children so that you and your wife could have very precious alone time together. Are you grateful at all for that? It doesn't justify or excuse the furniture re-arrangement.\n\nIn the above comment you mention that it would be a PITA to change the arrangement later while just your family is in the home, but it would be possible. You were probably aware that moving everything back would create bad feelings. So to avoid inconvenience to yourself, you created drama for your wife. It was a self-centered action, but may not rise all the way to being an AH.\n\nYour wife: In several of your comments you state that you are not certain how your wife actually feels, but you do mention in the original question that your wife does like the decorating taste of her parents. Did she actually want you to move things back or did she like the way her parents had arranged things? It is likely you don't know because your wife values current harmony above making her real opinions known. This is actually detrimental to your relationship.\n\nFrom personal experience, my wife and I had been married for ten years before she told me that I had been mildly steamrolling her the entire time. This was in small decisions like where to eat out or what TV show to watch. I make decisions about what I would like faster than my wife does, so I would state what I wanted and wait a bit for her to state what she wanted. Getting silence for a few moments I would assume that she agreed and just move on with what I wanted to do. Ten years in she realized that nothing would change if she didn't speak up that she wasn't done making a decision. I was devastated that I had been overpowering her for so long. She says that she really should have spoken up sooner.\n\nYour wife should really speak up. And you should just listen.", "> but that\u2019s probably a UK thing\n\nSo is the word \"whilst\", though it used sometimes (from my looking it up on google) in Australia.", "I'm about to do an online order for niknaks thanks to your comment.

The IL's keep making power plays, wife allows it and OP is getting rightfully tired of it...His rearranging wasn't just because the timing was convenient but he was also making his own statement.  He's said he and his wife communicate well to each other, that's why they made the decision for each to handle their own families and changes to the home had to be a two people decision, not just one spouse's.  Its just that OP's wife should've shut this down a while ago but she refuses to so yeah, OP needs to communicate to his wife how fed up he is with how she's not handling her family.
