{"id": 19020, "submission_id": "141acr2", "title": "AITA for moving back furniture that was rearranged without my permissions?", "selftext": "Alt account for privacy. My wife and 2 kids and I live far away from both of our families - like, 6-9 hour flight far. The grandparents visit several times a year, usually a few weeks at a time. We get along well with all of them, tho there is tension between my wife and her mom & stepdad more than the others. She does, however, like their decorating taste, so she often rearranges stuff at our house when they're around. (It's led a fight before when she sorta used them to do stuff I explicitly said I didn't want, but we're over that now.) Our general agreement is that I manage my family and she manages hers, so we don't put each other in awkward situations of fighting with the other's parents. \n\nLast time they were here, my wife and I took a multiday trip, since the only time we can do anything without the kids is when grandparents are visiting. After we came back, my in-laws had rearranged a few things in the house, of which one really made me angry. Our kitchen/dining/living room is an open space in the shape of a rectangle, except with a corner \"cut off,\" so it really has 5 sides. I had our living room rug placed so it was aligned with the 4 major walls, because that way all the kids' play areas were soft. Because the kids mess with it and because toys kept getting under it and tripping people, I used loads of double-sided tape to get the rug where I wanted it - I mean, it was clamped down hard. \n\nHowever, the couch is along the angled wall, and apparently they didn't like that the rug was at an angle to it, so they removed it, including all the tape, and angled it so it is aligned with the couch and nothing else. There were gaps where the kids play (so it's colder & harder), and one corner reached into the dining room, so the chairs constantly snag on it and people spill food or drink in that area. They said (as they always do) \"oh if you don't like it you can move it back.\" Thanks for giving me a few hours of work, but I didn't say anything then. (My wife didn't comment, but that could mean she didn't want a fight with them...or with me.)\n\nBefore they left, they took a day trip with my wife and the kids while I had some work to do. Once I finished I realized that the only time I'll have the house empty for a few hours is now, so I moved all the furniture off, realigned the rug, and placed it where I wanted it. When they came back they were upset that I had changed it back, and my wife was mad at me for doing it while they were still in town. She agreed that there would never be a time to do it when they're not but said it could wait until the next grandparents visit us (which hasn't been scheduled yet, so it's probably months away).  \n\nI think I was entitled to take my ILs on the offer to put it back if I didn't like it, since they did this without asking and it was clear from the mass of tape that I didn't put the rug there lightly, but AITA for not waiting until they were gone?", "created_utc": 1685961746, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/141acr2/aita_for_moving_back_furniture_that_was/", "score": 582, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Rearranging someone else\u2019s house without their consent is unbelievably rude.  Like, on the \u201cwho the hell does that?\u201d level of rude.  They\u2019ve got no right to be upset that you\u2019re restoring your house to the way *you* like it.  They don\u2019t live there and it should be set up in the way that the actual residents of the house want it.  All you did was highlight exactly how rude they were being.", "Hard NTA\n\nYou took them at their word.  They said you could put it back if you wanted to. I would have said something like... you lied to me?  You said I could put it back if I didn't like it and you lied to me?  This was not the truth?  (Let them explain themselves out of that mess)\n\nIt is beyond rude to rearrange the house when you are only a guest. You were full within your rights to take them up on their \"offer\".  It is so presumptuous as a guest to move furniture, and then to say you can move it back, as if you need their permission. What planet are the from?  They sound like aliens who know nothing of earth culture and common sense.", "Obviously NTA\n\nYour in laws feel too entitled to your home and your wife needs to put a stop to this nonsense ASAP. She needs to be on your side and should have said something to her parents the moment you came home and saw the change. If she is not there to make a stand with you then nothing will change and they will look at you as the irrational one.", "NTA. As someone with OCD, my response would be *nowhere* as level-headed as yours. Instant stressor and I would be absolutely livid. If I have something somewhere, it is there for a reason!\n\nAnd hey, they said you could move it back. They have no right to complain about this considering they moved everything around without permission in the first place. However, I think it would be worth explaining to your ILs \"hey, the rug is this way *for a reason* because the kids play there.\" Hopefully explaining the set up to them will prevent them from doing this in the future", "NTA\n\nI would kick anyone out of my house that took it upon themselves to rearrange my furniture. I don't care if it's my wife's parents. Who the hell do they think they are? That's completely unacceptable.", "NTA of course you should have changed it back, the masses of tape were a hint and a half that the rug was meant to be at that angle. How rude and arrogant to think they know better than you about your own home.\n\nGood lord imagine having enough free time to rearrange other people\u00b4s houses every time you visit, they need to play animal crossing or something so they can build their own little island and arrange things", "NTA.  You\u2019re in-law\u2019s behavior was both rude and presumptuous.  They had no right to rearrange your home to their tastes without consulting anyone.  You had every right to put it back the way you had it.  And there was no need to spare a thought for their feelings on the matter, because they didn\u2019t bother sparing a thought for yours.", ">They said (as they always do) \"oh if you don't like it **you** can move it back.\" \n\nThis would tick me off.   How nice of them to tell you that you can fix your own home the way you like.  It was the way you liked it before they moved things around without your consent.  And now the onus is on you to undo their handywork. \n\nNTA.  Your wife has to tell her parents not to do any reorganizing of anything without prior consent.", "NTA, you live there, therefore they should ask you before rearranging", "NTA. You really need to start enforcing some boundaries with these people. \n\nAlso, and this doesn't affect my verdict, what do you mean you wouldn't be able to move it back until the other Grandparents visit? Is it not possible for the kids to play elsewhere for a couple hours or do it when they're out/in bed?", "NTA. The gall of those people\u2026.", "NTA.  Who the hell rearranges the furniture in someone else's house?  Especially without permission, WTF.", "NTA but I think you should have talked to them or your wife to stop rearranging.", "NTA but it shouldn't have escalated to this stage. Your wife should have nipped this in the bud a while back. Guests offering input is fine but straight up rearranging is not ok.", "NTA.  They are so rude.   I be petty and start moving things at their house -  oh I rearranged all your kitchen cabinets - good luck finding stuff!", "NTA they are for moving your furniture around pulling up your rug. That\u2019s just not ok.", "NTA\n\nThat is INSANE though, that is YOUR living space and you clearly put thought into it, if it was a minor thing that can easily be moved around? Sure, who cares ya know, but something you taped down with purpose like that?? Even worse is that they complained about you taking them up on that offer??? You can (re)decorate your house at any time given, the fact that your wife didnt jump in to defend you is also kinda wild, especially with the \"everyone takes care of their own family\" thing", "NTA. \n\nWho goes to someone's house, as a guest, and just helps themselves to rearranging the space without permission??? That is poor guest etiquette. And I'm sure they wouldn't appreciate it if you went to their house and did that. So, I'm not sure why they feel they have the right to do it in your space. \n\nYou have every right to put the place back the way it was, the way YOU want it, in YOUR own house. haha. And they don't really get to be upset if you do. It's not their place. I do think, though, that your wife should speak to them about it, since that is the agreement you two have (her responsible for her parents, you for yours) to express boundaries. Though, I'm not sure why they even need a conversation to let them know this behavior is not okay...  \n\n\nAnyway....haha.", "You're NTA. It is **your home, not theirs** and it is ridiculous that they're pulling the wounded feelings card on you for putting your own living room back together as you had it. If anything, it is incredibly rude on their part to alter someone else's furnishings.", "\u201cOh, if you don\u2019t like it you can move it back\u201d.\n\nOk, done. NTA", "So, like, they should absolutely not have moved it- and the rug clearly doesn\u2019t fit the space when arranged \u201caligned\u201d.\n\nAlso it sounds like the wife doesn\u2019t disagree with the arrangement, just didn\u2019t want to spark a fight. Which absolutely would happen the next time they come to visit.\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonally I\u2019d have handed them a fresh roll of tape and made them put it back. As it stands\u2026 NTA", "NTA. The best way for them to not get annoyed with you undoing their changes to your home, is for them to simply not change anything without discussing with you beforehand.", "NTA. What they did - they claimed your home as theirs to do whatever they please. So rude. And they are even disappointed seeing everything back!", "I'm thinking ESH, your in laws for thinking they had any right to re-arrange things without permission, your wife for telling you you should have waited, and you for (apparently) not letting your wife have any say in the way your (and her!) house is decorated.", "You are certainly well within your rights to arrange your furniture however you choose but I\u2019m finding it very hard to believe you couldn\u2019t wait until they left. You apparently were able to put everything back by yourself in a very short amount of time & your IL\u2019s had no problem moving things when kids were at home. So maybe it wouldn\u2019t have been that challenging to just hold off until they left. Perhaps you had another reason for not waiting? \n\nThey annoyed you, so you annoyed them. You\u2019re even now. If your wife never explained to her parents that you didn\u2019t appreciate them constantly rearranging your stuff \u2014 they probably know now. Hopefully.... hopefully, that\u2019s the end of it. \n\nESH\n\neta", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I mean the entitlement these kinds of people must feel on a daily basis is insane.", "When i stayed with my sister and husband, i used to dust the house and pick up after them and hence rearranging lot of things not arranged originally. But they were unattached utility items. not thickly stuck rug and their couch positioning.", "I've actually had a relative do it to me once when I let them stay over. I was so annoyed but at least when I reamed them out they agreed to put everything back properly themselves lol. They like...rearranged my living room furniture for \"better flow\" and I was like so help me if you don't fix it Right Now...\n\nI've never thought to change stuff myself. The most I do is move portable ticking clocks out of any room I'm sleeping in and I always put them back in the morning.", "Obviously NTA\n\nYour in laws feel too entitled to your home and your wife needs to put a stop to this nonsense ASAP.!!", "I would have insisted they move it back immediately. And if things like that kept happening, they wouldn't be welcome in my home.", "No way in hell I would've waited until they left.  This wasn't just about moving furniture, it was a power play by the IL's to show they had power in their daughter's home.  OP just took the time to show them that in fact, no they didn't have power....at least not over him.  It was very apparent when they said \"you can change it back\" but then got angry when he did.  You don't allow toxic people to do what they want...especially in front of the children!!  OP is teaching them he's not putting up with their bs toxicity....as he should.\n\nThe parents/IL's are the only AH's in this story.  The wife needs to learn how to stand up to her parents and set boundaries or go LC.  You don't get to pull that ish in my home and I sit idly by and let you do it.", "Why should he have waited? That's dumb.   He can have it done whenever the hell he wants.   In fact, it never should have been moved to begin with.   The inlaws should  be the ones putting it back when HE wants, and not a moment later.", "I take it you don\u2019t have a snack where you are called niknaks? They are awesome. I\u2019ve only ever seen the ornaments, bric a brac etc spelled knick-knacks, but that\u2019s probably a UK thing", "Someone did this to me in my hs hostel room. It was kind of lame considering how little furniture and stuff we were allowed.\n\nIt's meant to be a shared room but seniors get priority if there are unfilled room and they don't want to share. \nVery basic furniture, 2 beds and  2 study desks. Generic layout was bed, desk x 2, bed, with furniture being an upside down U.\n\nI was too tired to move things back that night so just left it how it was for the night. Ended up realizing I actually liked having the bed by the window.\nSo I just pushed them together.\nPutting the desks on either side made it seem like I had a king bed and large side tables.", "This is not the first time this rearranging has happened. Who knows what wife has told her parents. Sure go ahead & rearrange it. Apparently, wife has no issue with that.\n\nSeems like this family needs to learn how to communicate better.", "Again... people keep missing this is not the first time this has happened. What\u2019s the wife\u2019s perspective here? For all anyone knows they told her they were going to do this before OP & wife left. She apparently has no issues with parents rearranging her home.", "its knick knacks or nick nacks in america ive never seen niknaks", "Rib & Saucy NikNaks for the win!", "Which country/ school did you go to because my hostel had the same rules for seniors getting priority if their where empty rooms and every Aprils fool they did the exact same thing although they didn\u2019t quite get so lucky at to flip my bed when I made it to Matric", "It seems to me that your wife is more upset about the fact that there is drama to deal with. She knows her mother can be a PITA, so she\u2019s just trying to get through the visit.  Because you change things back, now, your wife has to listen to her mother. When you aren\u2019t used to having other people in your house, that can also be very stressful. I would just give your wife some grace.  Sometimes apologizing, even though you don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re wrong is worthwhile.  You could even structure your apology around the idea that you recognize that she is stressed with people in the house, and how you didn\u2019t mean to add to her stress.\n\nAll that said, you are NTA", "They\u2019ve just brought out the scampi ones again - haven\u2019t seen them since I was at school (somewhere back in the late Triassic)", "Exactly right. It\u2019s not quite the same, but when we moved into our current house my wife\u2019s mom decided she was going to arrange my office for me. I went along with it because my wife just wanted to placate her mom. Few months later I rearranged my space to be more comfortable for me\u2026 and then found out later that MIL was furious at me for doing that! She didn\u2019t say anything to me, though, but my poor wife had to hear it. And I\u2019m thinking, it\u2019s my room, I work in here every day, but I\u2019m not supposed to have any input into how it\u2019s set up? Weird.", "Ooh, I\u2019ll have to try and find some! Only 1 supermarket in 4 near me sell any niknaks at all."]}
