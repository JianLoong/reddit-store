{"id": 19020, "submission_id": "141acr2", "title": "AITA for moving back furniture that was rearranged without my permissions?", "selftext": "Alt account for privacy. My wife and 2 kids and I live far away from both of our families - like, 6-9 hour flight far. The grandparents visit several times a year, usually a few weeks at a time. We get along well with all of them, tho there is tension between my wife and her mom & stepdad more than the others. She does, however, like their decorating taste, so she often rearranges stuff at our house when they're around. (It's led a fight before when she sorta used them to do stuff I explicitly said I didn't want, but we're over that now.) Our general agreement is that I manage my family and she manages hers, so we don't put each other in awkward situations of fighting with the other's parents. \n\nLast time they were here, my wife and I took a multiday trip, since the only time we can do anything without the kids is when grandparents are visiting. After we came back, my in-laws had rearranged a few things in the house, of which one really made me angry. Our kitchen/dining/living room is an open space in the shape of a rectangle, except with a corner \"cut off,\" so it really has 5 sides. I had our living room rug placed so it was aligned with the 4 major walls, because that way all the kids' play areas were soft. Because the kids mess with it and because toys kept getting under it and tripping people, I used loads of double-sided tape to get the rug where I wanted it - I mean, it was clamped down hard. \n\nHowever, the couch is along the angled wall, and apparently they didn't like that the rug was at an angle to it, so they removed it, including all the tape, and angled it so it is aligned with the couch and nothing else. There were gaps where the kids play (so it's colder & harder), and one corner reached into the dining room, so the chairs constantly snag on it and people spill food or drink in that area. They said (as they always do) \"oh if you don't like it you can move it back.\" Thanks for giving me a few hours of work, but I didn't say anything then. (My wife didn't comment, but that could mean she didn't want a fight with them...or with me.)\n\nBefore they left, they took a day trip with my wife and the kids while I had some work to do. Once I finished I realized that the only time I'll have the house empty for a few hours is now, so I moved all the furniture off, realigned the rug, and placed it where I wanted it. When they came back they were upset that I had changed it back, and my wife was mad at me for doing it while they were still in town. She agreed that there would never be a time to do it when they're not but said it could wait until the next grandparents visit us (which hasn't been scheduled yet, so it's probably months away).  \n\nI think I was entitled to take my ILs on the offer to put it back if I didn't like it, since they did this without asking and it was clear from the mass of tape that I didn't put the rug there lightly, but AITA for not waiting until they were gone?", "created_utc": 1685961746, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/141acr2/aita_for_moving_back_furniture_that_was/", "score": 3336, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Rearranging someone else\u2019s house without their consent is unbelievably rude.  Like, on the \u201cwho the hell does that?\u201d level of rude.  They\u2019ve got no right to be upset that you\u2019re restoring your house to the way *you* like it.  They don\u2019t live there and it should be set up in the way that the actual residents of the house want it.  All you did was highlight exactly how rude they were being.", "Hard NTA\n\nYou took them at their word.  They said you could put it back if you wanted to. I would have said something like... you lied to me?  You said I could put it back if I didn't like it and you lied to me?  This was not the truth?  (Let them explain themselves out of that mess)\n\nIt is beyond rude to rearrange the house when you are only a guest. You were full within your rights to take them up on their \"offer\".  It is so presumptuous as a guest to move furniture, and then to say you can move it back, as if you need their permission. What planet are the from?  They sound like aliens who know nothing of earth culture and common sense.", "Obviously NTA\n\nYour in laws feel too entitled to your home and your wife needs to put a stop to this nonsense ASAP. She needs to be on your side and should have said something to her parents the moment you came home and saw the change. If she is not there to make a stand with you then nothing will change and they will look at you as the irrational one.", "NTA. As someone with OCD, my response would be *nowhere* as level-headed as yours. Instant stressor and I would be absolutely livid. If I have something somewhere, it is there for a reason!\n\nAnd hey, they said you could move it back. They have no right to complain about this considering they moved everything around without permission in the first place. However, I think it would be worth explaining to your ILs \"hey, the rug is this way *for a reason* because the kids play there.\" Hopefully explaining the set up to them will prevent them from doing this in the future", "NTA\n\nI would kick anyone out of my house that took it upon themselves to rearrange my furniture. I don't care if it's my wife's parents. Who the hell do they think they are? That's completely unacceptable.", "NTA of course you should have changed it back, the masses of tape were a hint and a half that the rug was meant to be at that angle. How rude and arrogant to think they know better than you about your own home.\n\nGood lord imagine having enough free time to rearrange other people\u00b4s houses every time you visit, they need to play animal crossing or something so they can build their own little island and arrange things", "NTA.  You\u2019re in-law\u2019s behavior was both rude and presumptuous.  They had no right to rearrange your home to their tastes without consulting anyone.  You had every right to put it back the way you had it.  And there was no need to spare a thought for their feelings on the matter, because they didn\u2019t bother sparing a thought for yours.", ">They said (as they always do) \"oh if you don't like it **you** can move it back.\" \n\nThis would tick me off.   How nice of them to tell you that you can fix your own home the way you like.  It was the way you liked it before they moved things around without your consent.  And now the onus is on you to undo their handywork. \n\nNTA.  Your wife has to tell her parents not to do any reorganizing of anything without prior consent.", "NTA, you live there, therefore they should ask you before rearranging", "NTA. You really need to start enforcing some boundaries with these people. \n\nAlso, and this doesn't affect my verdict, what do you mean you wouldn't be able to move it back until the other Grandparents visit? Is it not possible for the kids to play elsewhere for a couple hours or do it when they're out/in bed?", "NTA. The gall of those people\u2026.", "NTA.  Who the hell rearranges the furniture in someone else's house?  Especially without permission, WTF.", "NTA but I think you should have talked to them or your wife to stop rearranging.", "NTA but it shouldn't have escalated to this stage. Your wife should have nipped this in the bud a while back. Guests offering input is fine but straight up rearranging is not ok.", "NTA.  They are so rude.   I be petty and start moving things at their house -  oh I rearranged all your kitchen cabinets - good luck finding stuff!", "NTA they are for moving your furniture around pulling up your rug. That\u2019s just not ok.", "NTA\n\nThat is INSANE though, that is YOUR living space and you clearly put thought into it, if it was a minor thing that can easily be moved around? Sure, who cares ya know, but something you taped down with purpose like that?? Even worse is that they complained about you taking them up on that offer??? You can (re)decorate your house at any time given, the fact that your wife didnt jump in to defend you is also kinda wild, especially with the \"everyone takes care of their own family\" thing", "NTA. \n\nWho goes to someone's house, as a guest, and just helps themselves to rearranging the space without permission??? That is poor guest etiquette. And I'm sure they wouldn't appreciate it if you went to their house and did that. So, I'm not sure why they feel they have the right to do it in your space. \n\nYou have every right to put the place back the way it was, the way YOU want it, in YOUR own house. haha. And they don't really get to be upset if you do. It's not their place. I do think, though, that your wife should speak to them about it, since that is the agreement you two have (her responsible for her parents, you for yours) to express boundaries. Though, I'm not sure why they even need a conversation to let them know this behavior is not okay...  \n\n\nAnyway....haha.", "You're NTA. It is **your home, not theirs** and it is ridiculous that they're pulling the wounded feelings card on you for putting your own living room back together as you had it. If anything, it is incredibly rude on their part to alter someone else's furnishings.", "\u201cOh, if you don\u2019t like it you can move it back\u201d.\n\nOk, done. NTA", "So, like, they should absolutely not have moved it- and the rug clearly doesn\u2019t fit the space when arranged \u201caligned\u201d.\n\nAlso it sounds like the wife doesn\u2019t disagree with the arrangement, just didn\u2019t want to spark a fight. Which absolutely would happen the next time they come to visit.\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonally I\u2019d have handed them a fresh roll of tape and made them put it back. As it stands\u2026 NTA", "NTA. The best way for them to not get annoyed with you undoing their changes to your home, is for them to simply not change anything without discussing with you beforehand.", "NTA. What they did - they claimed your home as theirs to do whatever they please. So rude. And they are even disappointed seeing everything back!", "I'm thinking ESH, your in laws for thinking they had any right to re-arrange things without permission, your wife for telling you you should have waited, and you for (apparently) not letting your wife have any say in the way your (and her!) house is decorated.", "You are certainly well within your rights to arrange your furniture however you choose but I\u2019m finding it very hard to believe you couldn\u2019t wait until they left. You apparently were able to put everything back by yourself in a very short amount of time & your IL\u2019s had no problem moving things when kids were at home. So maybe it wouldn\u2019t have been that challenging to just hold off until they left. Perhaps you had another reason for not waiting? \n\nThey annoyed you, so you annoyed them. You\u2019re even now. If your wife never explained to her parents that you didn\u2019t appreciate them constantly rearranging your stuff \u2014 they probably know now. Hopefully.... hopefully, that\u2019s the end of it. \n\nESH\n\neta", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I\u2019m talking about things like taking a queen bed and a set of bunk beds and swapping them.  \n\nMy husband would have horrible bookends to his vacation because he would start it and end it moving furniture.", "Maybe they'll get the point that it's rude to rearrange other people's houses without asking and without their permission. Probably not, but hope springs eternal. NTA", "NTA - but your wife needs to have your back on this situation.  She was \"low key\" the AH for siding with them.  Your behavior was a boundary to them.  Stop messing with my house.  \n\nYour wife getting mad at you for having boundaries with your ILs sucks.  She needs to do better and be a better partner.  She should ALWAYS have you back - especially in a situation like this - when they are crossing all sorts of mad lines.", "Anyone who rearranged my stuff would not be welcome back without a serious talk about boundaries and respect happening first. My space is my safe haven and I would not tolerate anyone disrespecting that. Absolutely NTA, your wife should not only be supporting you on this but should be the one having this conversation with her family.", "NTA, it's not their house to arrange things in without permission. It seems insane to me to do that at all, let alone to continue when they encountered the tape (a sign that someone obviously wants the rug to stay in it's place). \n\nIt does also seem a bit strange to me that your wife is so non-confrontational with her parents to the extent that she herself was upset with you for moving the rug while they were there. Granted, I don't know their relationship and expect there could very well be some sort of background for that", "NTA talk to your wife and tell her if your ILs do this again you\u2019ll divorce her.  That\u2019ll put a stop to the nonsense.", "NTA do you ever do trips to visit the parents? Do it to them.", "Nta. Establish dominance.", "NTA\n\nDon't move stuff in my house!", "NTA - Who rearranges furniture in someone else's house.  \n\n\nWTF?", "Honesty they would have to stay in a hotel next time. Or they could never be in my home by their selves. And your real issue is with your wife. I would not be surprised if she told them they could do it and then got you out the house.", "NTA. Repeat after me \"this is my home, this is my home.\" \n\nMoving furniture is such a silky thing to do, but if you sometimes like their style, make sure to ask about a specific area. Start telling them areas that are off limits or why you have things a certain way.\n\nHonestly, I think you gave the impression that they could do whatever they like because you haven't enforced boundaries. \n\nIf your wife supports your reasoning, then she should explain the error to her parents and apologise for not giving them the heads up this time.", "NTA, they don't live there and you didn't ask. It's not an insult to have different decorating tastes, and if they're going to be this fragile about it they shouldn't be redecorating other people's houses", "NTA\n\nThey told you you could move it back if you didn't like it. So you did.\n\nWhy did they give you that option if they didn't want you to take it? Yep, so they can pretend they're holier than thou.", "Why was your wife mad, is she a baby?", "AITA YouTube channel https://youtu.be/pCwXmeO4a2g", "We had a weird version of this once in my church group.  One couple was house sitting for another.  The owners encouraged the sitters to entertain since they didn\u2019t have their own place at the time (lived with in laws).  There was a great dinner party with a few volunteers to help clean up.  That\u2019s when we realized that when searching for an item during prep we should have made a note where to put it back.  A debate ensued on whether to leave a bunch of clean items out for their return or potentially hiding them when we guessed where they belonged.  I don\u2019t remember what was decided.", "NTA\n\nHopefully they'll get the message to leave stuff in YOUR house alone", "NTA. This isn\u2019t animal crossing where you can go in and re arrange your villagers home the way you want . They had no right to move the carpet and the couch. Shame on them!", "NTA. That\u2019s some bullshit if I ever heard it. Why on earth would anyone feel entitled to rearrange furniture in another person\u2019s house? \n\nI\u2019d love to rearrange the dishes in my sister\u2019s cabinets but I would never. I wouldn\u2019t even have the audacity to ask. \n\nNo way. NTA.", "NTA \n\nThey were wrong to make that change. \n\nPro tip: do the same to their home if you ever get the chance.", "Growing up my Mom had a housekeeper come in once a month to do the heavy-duty house cleaning. She would move stuff and place it where ever. OMG...that would piss me off soooo badly. She would also rearrange the furniture in our rooms. Granted we were kids, but still, they were OUR rooms, not hers. Ever since then, I can't stand for my stuff to be messed with. \n\nNTA. IL's should have asked permission before re-arranging ANYTHING!", "Right? I did some yard work for my inlaws (they have some mobility issues) but I talked to them about everything I saw that I thought needed to be done before I did it. I cut back a bunch of branches and moved some small bushes that were getting bigger and started to lay over the sidewalk. I had a few ideas of my own but again, I asked even though obviously I thought they were good ideas. I can't imagine just moving things around without permission/being asked to. \n\nI hate when people just move things, I put stuff where it is for a reason.  I hired a then friend once to help clean (she did this part time) and all she wanted to do was redecorate. Like, ma'am, please. This isn't helpful. She wanted to keep my dog's waterbowl on the counter \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "You've never met my in-laws, lol.\n\nThey live all of ten minutes away, and make it a point to come to our house and move shit around at least once a month.  It could be our chairs, couches, and rugs in a room get moved to a new orientation.  They could decide they don't like how our kitchen is arranged, so the pots/pans/etc find themselves moved into a different cupboard.  Or they could decide they don't like the closet something is in, and so move it to a different closet.   If we can't find something, there's probably a good 75% chance the in-laws took it upon themselves to move it at some point in the last 6 months.\n\nThey also take it upon themselved to clean.  The house is clean already, but they feel a compulsion to clean things to \"their standards\".  Since they were going to clean anyways, my wife decided to pay them as if they were housecleaners, so at least she can at least dictate how things should be done like a customer would.  They've been this way since I met my wife 15 years ago, and somewhere around ten years ago I just sort of accepted it as our normal - I'm pretty laissez-faire about it all.  My wife though hates it when they move things.  She's told them a hundred times over the years to leave things alone, but they don't.  So at this point, for the sake of harmony, she puts up with it.\n\nOutside of this one invasive thing, they're very good people.  But it's like a compulsion for them - they do this at their house too.", "I'd simply ask \"why did you think it was okay to move in the first place?\" and whatever nonsense they ramble off, follow up with a \"please do not rearrange our belongings again\"", "He just put it back", "Not even a little bit", "That helps how?", "My brother and I swapped our living room and dining room (open concept, my house is basically a box with two bedrooms on one end) when we were teenagers, my dad was on a work trip or vacation or something, so we thought it'd be fun to mess with mom at 2am. Totally worth the \"wtf\" look on her face in the morning \ud83d\ude02", "That's a life-time ban in my house!", "Sorry - but also rib n sauce are brilliant!", "[removed]", "Probably a good thing I hadn't watched Puppet Master yet.", "I think you might be mistaken I am speaking about boarding school the hostel in my question is in regards to the students residence were the residents roughly ranged from 13-18 so when it came to April fools day we essentially went ham pranking each other this include flipping beds, putting gel soap on door knobs and other mundane pranks. As for why they didn\u2019t get the chance is because I was up most of the night writing a History essay and finishing off an IT Practical"]}
