That place is dirty as fuck. Pretty much every story I have heard from friends and family about that place involves the kids coming home sick.\n\n2. It's also super expensive. Rooms go for at least $400. And that's not including meals, snacks, souvenirs and whatever else, all also at a premium.\n\nAs the month continues to roll by, her & I continue to plan presents for the kids. She had never said anything more to me about it, so I figured she had decided against it (the presents were ordered by her bc the Amazon Prime is on her account, but I knew what she was getting.) Anyways, on the 16th, she let me know that she had booked the trip.\n\nI immediately asked her why she had gone against me & she said that the kids wanted it and that it would be fun. I told her that we really couldn't afford it, especially being last minute and over New Years (I already had taken the week between Christmas and New Years off), with inflation (we're both making pretty much the same as pre-pandemic when you adjust for inflation), plus helping to pay my mother's hospital bills from this fall, and she said we would figure it out.\n\nI had also been planning to surprise her by taking her out to a nice dinner and drinks on NYE, and had even let our baby-shitter know and put in a reservation at her favorite nice restaurant, both of which I had to cancel.\n\nI have decided that I will not be going and have told my wife as such. I have also told the kids and when they asked me why I told them that it was a work conflict, as to not worry them.", "created_utc": 1703700082, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18s6slt/aita_for_refusing_to_go_on_a_trip_my_wife/", "score": 1403, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Whatever issue you have with the way your wife handled things, punishing your kids for it shows that you are a terribly selfish person. Go, have fun with the kids and handle the situation with your wife as 2 adults.\n\nI honestly think we are missing some context.

Still, I don\u2019t condone her way of doing.", "Nta\n\n\nMight get slammed, but here is my take.\n\nYou told her no, she didn't discuss it more. Then, plan and pay for it with I am assuming both of your incomes. \n\nSo she has learned she can do and spend what she wants without your agreement. She can use the kids. Your wants, needs, thoughts, and input mean nothing. So, going only shows you will continue to cave to her making choices without your agreement.\n\nI am assuming she agreed to pay your mom's medical bills. If not, then you are TA for that. If so, then she is beyond wrong. \n\nTo a point that such a display will get to be the normal, and I personally would go through bills and what is made. Then separate finances. A joint for bills for the family. Based on pay depends on who pays what. Then, the rest you put money into three things. One a savings for moms medical. Two savings for vacations and holidays. Three the rest to pay things like anything with just your name and what not. \n\nIs it extreme. Yes, but for a spouse to just blow money like that is not ok. To be expected to just accept it, especially if you are struggling, is not ok. Because it means less time with kids while working more to pay bills. That is a form of abuse. It is also a consequence to her actions that could mean losing a home or car and many other things. \n\nSo from then on, either you both pay for the vacation, or it doesn't happen. That way, you both pay for gifts, or it doesn't happen. This way you have money to pay bills and she can just learn that as a team you make big spending choices together or they don't get access to money you make to do as they will with it. \n\n\nYes, I will get slammed, but if OP was female, reddit would be up in arms on how abusive this is. She is making choices with money that is partly his. She is taking money not agreed upon to use how she wants. He is worried about bills, but hey, he is being an AH because he is helping with medical bills. I am assuming she agreed to help pay. He is an AH by refusing to give in to her and show she can do as she wants, but he is going to be the person suffering because of her actions having to make up the money lost. I am sorry, but a joint account is that joint. If both don't agree, then it doesn't get spent. Period.", "ESH. \n\nYou shouldn't just assume that since you raised some objections that meant your wife was going to immediately capitulate to your rule.\n\nShe shouldn't have booked it without further discussion and getting to a point you could agree on.\n\nYour first argument against the place - that it is \"dirty as fuck\" is anecdotal at best and quite likely untrue. I'm reading from the comments that this is a water play park? Is it not chlorinated to the max like every other mass water amusement facility? There are industry and legal standards that places like that must comply with to ensure safety for patrons. \n\nIt's somewhat amusing that you are mad that the plans your wife made without your knowledge ruined the plans that you made without her knowledge. \n\nYou guys need to get on the same page and learn to communicate and compromise.", "YTA.

That place is dirty as fuck. Pretty much every story I have heard from friends and family about that place involves the kids coming home sick.\n\n2. It's also super expensive. Rooms go for at least $400. And that's not including meals, snacks, souvenirs and whatever else, all also at a premium.\n\nAs the month continues to roll by, her & I continue to plan presents for the kids. She had never said anything more to me about it, so I figured she had decided against it (the presents were ordered by her bc the Amazon Prime is on her account, but I knew what she was getting.) Anyways, on the 16th, she let me know that she had booked the trip.\n\nI immediately asked her why she had gone against me & she said that the kids wanted it and that it would be fun. I told her that we really couldn't afford it, especially being last minute and over New Years (I already had taken the week between Christmas and New Years off), with inflation (we're both making pretty much the same as pre-pandemic when you adjust for inflation), plus helping to pay my mother's hospital bills from this fall, and she said we would figure it out.\n\nI had also been planning to surprise her by taking her out to a nice dinner and drinks on NYE, and had even let our baby-shitter know and put in a reservation at her favorite nice restaurant, both of which I had to cancel.\n\nI have decided that I will not be going and have told my wife as such. I have also told the kids and when they asked me why I told them that it was a work conflict, as to not worry them.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

No. That\u2019s crappy, especially if money is a real issue.

The gift and blessing is for all the ways that they're an amazing person, not for being so transactional that paying for hospital bills comes with a \"well what do I get for this\".", "Except she didn't decide to take the kids away, she decided his plans for him and is now mad she doesn't have control over him.", "That makes me think of an ex who would say crap like that and then when the money came up short, it meant we were late paying bills or I was scrambling to find a side gig to cover the shortfall.", "That\u2019s just the room (and probably on the low end).  Food, gas, and everything else when going on those trips at least doubles the cost.", "Are you saying they shouldent have helped pay for his mothers medical care?", "Yea, that\u2019s a instantly disregardable opinion. OP isn\u2019t a brat for attempting to be fiscally responsible and being upset when their significant other makes a major financial decision behind their back. I hope you don\u2019t gaslight your partners with absurdities like this. Its easy to be blas\u00e9 with other people\u2019s money", "my kid just licked the wall in a HOSPITAL today! Kids will always just be gross little germ magnets lol, that\u2019s life. If you can\u2019t handle kids being sick, don\u2019t have kids cause they get sick ALL the time lol", "\"Her and I continue to plan presents for the kids\"\n\nReading sure is hard. It being ordered through her account because she has prime does not mean he didn't plan any of the presents out. He also planned stuff on his own without her. Is she now the shitty partner?", "Just as an aside, if you happen to be a firefighter or police officer, they may offer you a discount based on that.  It's been a while, but it was a nice surprise for my husband and I the last time we went.", "Hmmmm. So resorts being a cesspool of germs and bacteria are assumptions? The tickets being expensive were assumptions? Arent these things facts? You see where the bias shows here? For the second point, as unreliable a narrator OP is, as long as it's not in the story, i cannot say for a fact that his wife reacted negatively so I agree with you there that maybe, this is where i show a bias towards what info was given.\n\nStill, we are all just discussing in hypotheticals so you could definitely be right. Hope you a great new year ahead, thanks for the convo here :)", "The point is not if the wife disagrees with the spending for grandmas bills or if there is \u2018equivalency\u2019 between waterparks and medical bills. \n\nPeople can compromise on something, rationally agree with it but still not like the consequences. And hubby can be a bit more appreciative of the fact that wife rationally agrees with the extra spending and accepts the negative consequences this has for their family life.\n\nIn this case the impact is that she wants her kids to have great memories growing up. Kids for example grow out of waterparks. Not in a couple of months time obviously, but this is why hubby could have been more understanding of wife\u2019s fundamental point and suggested a compromise (later, more modest).\n\nThat is the point which hubby did not get. He got attached to this exact proposal at this exact time for this exact cost and did not have the empathy and mental flexibility empathize with the wife tat she is right that these experiences are great for the family while at the same time making the argument to postpone it and to go for a more modest proposal at this point in time.\n\nHubby has low empathy for what his wife finds most important. There is some cashflow apparently and he wants NYE dinners with babysitters for him and his wife and she wants to spend those funds on great family memories.\n\nYou are misrepresenting the wife\u2019s perspective and you reducing this to a \u2018need versus want\u2019 discussion removes all nuance about how the family\u2019s needs can be taken better into account while also taking into account that money is tight right now.", "No-one here said that grandmas bills should not be paid. The point was that given that there apparently is spending money available (NYE dinner, drinks and babysitter), hubby could have redirected that spending towards a more modest family activity - or pushed that activity back in time when money is less tight. Anything else really than outright saying no and leaving the underlying need unaddressed.\n\nLike the husband, you are stuck in the frame that because grandma is sick everyone should just soldier on. Wife is more focused on what the family needs and how some unique family experiences can be created for the kids. While it is extremely valid help is given with grandma\u2019s bills, ensuring family experiences are created is also a valid goal that should be nurtured.", "He decided plans for her as well. And he\u2019s decided to divert funds from the family for his mother. He\u2019s an AH", "Uh, yeah", "This really has nothing to do with his mother and everything to do with the fact that when he wants to he\u2019s willing to shell out thousands but when his wife wants to he won\u2019t. Marriage is about compromise, his wife hopefully agreed to help his mother and it\u2019s reasonable to expect him to compromise with his wife.  He doesn\u2019t have a responsibility towards his mother/her finances, but he does towards his wife/kids and it\u2019s not unreasonable to ask him to spend time with them even if it costs him money.", "I don't live in a particularly HCOL area. My husband and I priced restaurants for NYE and every single one of the decent places is only serving a prix fixe NYE menu with the cheapest starting at around $100-$125 pp. You can have a champagne add on for another $50 or order a la carte drinks at $10-$12 each. Babysitters are on premium rates that night so a sitter for my kid is looking like $30/hr and up. So around $500 sounds about right if we want to have a nice night out. We could literally spend a couple of nights in the mountains for the same price or less.", "Mine is a big fan of trying to lick the conveyor belt at the grocery store. No matter what we do, kids are nasty AF by nature. There\u2019s enough chlorine in the water to kill damn near anything and if you\u2019re worried about walking in surfaces, get some cheap water shoes. Bam, problems solved!", "I'm pretty sure you're OP on his main, lol", "I haven't written anything assuming the wife's perspective, are you sure you're replying to the right person? All I have said on OP's situation specifically is that I agreed with a comment that said he needs to communicate better with his wife.\n\n I was replying to a comment which represented the spending on OP's mother's **hospital bills** as something which was a compromise or concession from his wife. I have no idea how his wife feels about that spending, there's nothing about it from OP, so I'm not going to assume anything about her or how she felt about the spending. \n\nMy comments following were to commenters who brought up the bills as a point of compromise hypothetically. My point remains that in any situation, people shouldn't treat the hospital bills of a close family member as similarly equivalent to a holiday (which they are doing by speaking about the spending on hospital bills as a compromise). It's not something to be appreciative of specifically, it's a basic expectation of your partner that goes both ways. We shouldn't create this hypothetical of a specific person being a saint for doing something that's part of the basic decency of being in a relationship (and once again, I repeat, I have no idea how OP's wife feels about this, we have nothing to assume here and I am not disparaging her for this in any way, this is entirely aimed at the beliefs pushed by some of the comments here).", "i don't think you know what a compromise is", "Sometimes that is the case. Like with medications and treatment. Keep being ignorant though.", ">hubby could have redirected that spending towards a more modest family activity - or pushed that activity back in time when money is less tight.\n\nNever disagreed with this.\n\n\n>Like the husband, you are stuck in the frame that because grandma is sick everyone should just soldier on.\n\nNegative, if the above situation works here money for taking other relatives shouldn't be part of compromise.\n\n>Wife is more focused on what the family needs and how some unique family experiences can be created for the kids.\n\nSo, why can't the wife redirect spending?", "I don't see where the husband went wrong. Wife proposed the park, Husband didn't like the sound of it, why is all the compromise on him? Why did the wife drop it, start buying the kids other presents with him, and go behind his back to get this one specific park. If other parks were a compromise, why didn't she bring it up?", "It's funny how often that's brought up when we have no knowledge of how his wife responded to him spending money on mom. It really shows the misandry of the sub.\n\nEdit: PSA do not interact with self admitted misandrists", "Gone to them a bunch on the east coast and never gotten sick.  Kid slept great from being exhausted!", "Man, reddit is wild.   \"Oh yeah, I am unironically saying that a three day vacation is more valuable and reasonable than caring for a close family members.  He has no responsibility for his mother's wellbeing..\"\n\nI can't decide if most of the posters are children or are just that self-absorbed.", "Sorry but no, when you get married and have kids your immediate, nuclear family is home. Not mom anymore.\n\nIt's great to help out family members when needed and when you can, but that doesn't mean that your wife and kids should miss out as a result when there is other options. \n\nMedical bills don't affect credit anymore, and like others have said they are usually able to be talked down to a lower payment that can be afforded. Kids shouldn't be missing out on family activities because of a voluntary, unnecessary expense. \n\nAnd this isn't to shit on OP, because it is an honorable thing to help out his Mom. But his priority should he with his wife and kids, and if helping his mom means they can't even take a small family vacation he needs to look at other options to lessen that burden that he chose to take on.", "Not with hospital bills in the US unless it's elective treatment.  The medicine has already been given before the bill ever arrives.", "Use whatever excuse you like. But I stand by what I said. He\u2019s an AH for being a selfish whiny brat about not having his way.", "We have visited the one in Scottrun PA without noticable health issues.", ">   \"Oh yeah, I am unironically saying that a three day vacation is more valuable and reasonable than caring for a close family members.  He has no responsibility for his mother's wellbeing..\"\n\nNo one said anything close to that.  Marriage is about compromise. He asked his wife to help his mother and they did.  Now his wife asked him for a family vacation and he refuses to even consider it and that is not fair to his wife who when he asked her for help, agreed and did so.  This is not about money, he just doesn't want to go and refuses to do this for his wife and kids.  He is selfish and marriage is not about being selfish.  He needs to give not just take.", ">Not with hospital bills in the US unless it's elective treatment.  The medicine has already been given before the bill ever arrives.\n\nLook at you, all confidently incorrect. \n\nThere's a difference between palliative care and treatment. \n\nEx: Can afford painkillers this month but not the actual drugs that treat my illness.", "I was mad at myself for not springing for the magiquest last time! We're definitely doing it on our next trip."]}
