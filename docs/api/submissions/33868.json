That place is dirty as fuck. Pretty much every story I have heard from friends and family about that place involves the kids coming home sick.\n\n2. It's also super expensive. Rooms go for at least $400. And that's not including meals, snacks, souvenirs and whatever else, all also at a premium.\n\nAs the month continues to roll by, her & I continue to plan presents for the kids. She had never said anything more to me about it, so I figured she had decided against it (the presents were ordered by her bc the Amazon Prime is on her account, but I knew what she was getting.) Anyways, on the 16th, she let me know that she had booked the trip.\n\nI immediately asked her why she had gone against me & she said that the kids wanted it and that it would be fun. I told her that we really couldn't afford it, especially being last minute and over New Years (I already had taken the week between Christmas and New Years off), with inflation (we're both making pretty much the same as pre-pandemic when you adjust for inflation), plus helping to pay my mother's hospital bills from this fall, and she said we would figure it out.\n\nI had also been planning to surprise her by taking her out to a nice dinner and drinks on NYE, and had even let our baby-shitter know and put in a reservation at her favorite nice restaurant, both of which I had to cancel.\n\nI have decided that I will not be going and have told my wife as such. I have also told the kids and when they asked me why I told them that it was a work conflict, as to not worry them.", "created_utc": 1703700082, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18s6slt/aita_for_refusing_to_go_on_a_trip_my_wife/", "score": 784, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Money is always going to be tight. You're never going to know that any hotel or resort is 100% spotless and disease free before you book it.

Whatever issue you have with the way your wife handled things, punishing your kids for it shows that you are a terribly selfish person. Go, have fun with the kids and handle the situation with your wife as 2 adults.\n\nI honestly think we are missing some context. The way your wife acted tends to make me believe that you would actually refuse to listen to anyone else\u2019s argument so you would deprive your kids of something they want to do just because you don\u2019t like it. Still, I don\u2019t condone her way of doing.", "Nta\n\n\nMight get slammed, but here is my take.\n\nYou told her no, she didn't discuss it more. Then, plan and pay for it with I am assuming both of your incomes. \n\nSo she has learned she can do and spend what she wants without your agreement. She can use the kids. Your wants, needs, thoughts, and input mean nothing. So, going only shows you will continue to cave to her making choices without your agreement.\n\nI am assuming she agreed to pay your mom's medical bills. If not, then you are TA for that. If so, then she is beyond wrong. \n\nTo a point that such a display will get to be the normal, and I personally would go through bills and what is made. Then separate finances. A joint for bills for the family. Based on pay depends on who pays what. Then, the rest you put money into three things. One a savings for moms medical. Two savings for vacations and holidays. Three the rest to pay things like anything with just your name and what not. \n\nIs it extreme. Yes, but for a spouse to just blow money like that is not ok. To be expected to just accept it, especially if you are struggling, is not ok. Because it means less time with kids while working more to pay bills. That is a form of abuse. It is also a consequence to her actions that could mean losing a home or car and many other things. \n\nSo from then on, either you both pay for the vacation, or it doesn't happen. That way, you both pay for gifts, or it doesn't happen. This way you have money to pay bills and she can just learn that as a team you make big spending choices together or they don't get access to money you make to do as they will with it. \n\n\nYes, I will get slammed, but if OP was female, reddit would be up in arms on how abusive this is. She is making choices with money that is partly his. She is taking money not agreed upon to use how she wants. He is worried about bills, but hey, he is being an AH because he is helping with medical bills. I am assuming she agreed to help pay. He is an AH by refusing to give in to her and show she can do as she wants, but he is going to be the person suffering because of her actions having to make up the money lost. I am sorry, but a joint account is that joint. If both don't agree, then it doesn't get spent. Period.", "ESH. \n\nYou shouldn't just assume that since you raised some objections that meant your wife was going to immediately capitulate to your rule.\n\nShe shouldn't have booked it without further discussion and getting to a point you could agree on.\n\nYour first argument against the place - that it is \"dirty as fuck\" is anecdotal at best and quite likely untrue. I'm reading from the comments that this is a water play park? Is it not chlorinated to the max like every other mass water amusement facility? There are industry and legal standards that places like that must comply with to ensure safety for patrons. \n\nIt's somewhat amusing that you are mad that the plans your wife made without your knowledge ruined the plans that you made without her knowledge. \n\nYou guys need to get on the same page and learn to communicate and compromise.", "YTA.

That place is dirty as fuck. Pretty much every story I have heard from friends and family about that place involves the kids coming home sick.\n\n2. It's also super expensive. Rooms go for at least $400. And that's not including meals, snacks, souvenirs and whatever else, all also at a premium.\n\nAs the month continues to roll by, her & I continue to plan presents for the kids. She had never said anything more to me about it, so I figured she had decided against it (the presents were ordered by her bc the Amazon Prime is on her account, but I knew what she was getting.) Anyways, on the 16th, she let me know that she had booked the trip.\n\nI immediately asked her why she had gone against me & she said that the kids wanted it and that it would be fun. I told her that we really couldn't afford it, especially being last minute and over New Years (I already had taken the week between Christmas and New Years off), with inflation (we're both making pretty much the same as pre-pandemic when you adjust for inflation), plus helping to pay my mother's hospital bills from this fall, and she said we would figure it out.\n\nI had also been planning to surprise her by taking her out to a nice dinner and drinks on NYE, and had even let our baby-shitter know and put in a reservation at her favorite nice restaurant, both of which I had to cancel.\n\nI have decided that I will not be going and have told my wife as such. I have also told the kids and when they asked me why I told them that it was a work conflict, as to not worry them.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "YTA, I took my kids there and it's a wonderful experience for them.

No. That\u2019s crappy, especially if money is a real issue. But it sounds like spending money on stuff that matters to you (paying your mom\u2019s bills, going out for NYE) is not something you clear with her first is it?", "NTA\n\nThat kind of $$$ needs to be agreed upon before committing.\n\nYou discussed and disagreed.
