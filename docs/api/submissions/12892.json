We came back to my home country and my ex's new \"home country\" for 3 weeks.  For 1.5 weeks, my son planned to go hang out with my ex (in a different state), and for 1.5 weeks, I would spend time with my side of the family. \n\nAbout 5 days into spending time with his (ex) step-dad, he calls to tell me he wants to come back to me because they have gotten into a verbal fight and no longer talking. I told him he won't see him again for another x months and to work it out.  \n\nA few days later,  my ex called to tell me to book a ticket because my son still wants to leave, and they aren't getting along. I told him that he is the adult and they need to work it out.  I will not buy a plane ticket.  I point out that my son will be leaving the house anyway in 4 days.  They both (my son and my ex) have been hounding me to get to a new plane ticket because he wants to leave. \n\nI have suggested that if my ex wants him gone, he can buy the ticket.

This one was the straw that broke the camel's back.  My son said there were other things that led up to it in similar issues.\n\nThat is why I said to work it out.

I would say talk to your kid and make sure it's the usual nonsense though.  Just in case something else (more serious) happened / is going on.", "INFO why does it have to be you buying the ticket?\n\nTo approach this coldly, I'd bill half of the ticket to the ex, and half from your son's future saving. The heck with their toddler-like behaviors.", "ESH or maybe NAH. It seems as though everyone has there reasoning as to why they want things to be their way, but overall it\u2019s just not readable to please everybody. You want them to work it out (understandable) and to not have to get another ticket since I\u2019m assuming the original is round trip. He no longer wants to be there due to an argument (need context as to what about) and I\u2019ll agree is acting a bit childish. Your ex doesn\u2019t want him to leave, but for some reason won\u2019t tell him that, which would most likely fix the issue and refuses to find the ticket back that would do the same. No one really wins and no one really loses as this is supposedly over an argument that may be something trivial.", "INFO: When you say \"foreign country\", are we talking short-haul or long-haul travel costs, and how affordable/unaffordable is this for you? Unless there's a child safety/welfare issue at stake, you shouldn't have to take the financial hit on this alone. One thing's for sure though, if/when there's a next time, always pay extra for a fully-flexible ticket!", "NTA. He needs to work through his conflict. He's not in danger.", "I have to say YTA: everyone keeps saying the kid is acting like a toddler. However, if this is the kind of living situation he has been brought up in, it's no wonder he doesn't know how to act. He isn't equipped to deal with or voice how he's feeling because you never had his back. You say your ex would joke in ways he didn't like- but did you ever once step in and stop that from happening? Now with you refusing to buy a plane ticket back, you're showing him he can't count on your help once again. \n\nI think counseling would do you all a world of good, quite frankly.", "YTA... what are you trying to teach your son, that he can't count on you?  If so, congratulations.  You win the crap mom of the year award.", "YTA, he is a minor wanting to come back to you because he is uncomfortable. If he was an adult that would be different. As a minor, your kid deserves to feel safe in your care.", "ESH. The parents in this situation should work it out for the best interest of the child. The ex is capable of communicating with his son and buying a plane ticket for him. He is choosing to do neither. You are the mother to your child and if he is uncomfortable, he needs to removed from the situation if it isn\u2019t safe.", "INFO: Is there a reason why ex can't pay for a plane ticket?Like is he struggling financially?

You're forcing your kid to spend time with a man he's not comfortable with. Yes, he seems to have chosen to visit him, but if it's not working out anymore, he shouldn't be forced to stay. I would buy him the ticket and going forward I would tell him that if he wants to see his stepfather he will have to pay it from his allowance money, or the stepfather will have to pay. You can teach them both to be more responsible after the crisis has passed. \n\nAlso: you say your son was acting like a toddler during his fights with his step dad. Children learn from the adults in their lives. He was not at fault, he was just mimicking the behavior of his father figure.", "NTA\n\nYou son wanted to spend time with your ex, he isn't in any danger and needs to see it through.  \n\nIt is a very petty argument to have but on a serious note the need for precision is something very similar to my friends son.  He is very literal and likes for things to be precisely defined.  They had him assessed as he was having trouble at school and was diagnosed with Aspergers (called high functioning autism now).  This has helped no end as he now has the support network at school and helps him and his parents.  He is much happier now as a result of all this.  Not saying that this is the case with your son but the precision thing and the resulting arguing reminded me of my friends son.", "Yeh we kinda need more information.

This led to a lot of fights between me and my ex. I kept trying to tell him he has to respect how my son likes and doesn't like joking around. \n\nUltimately,  these fights were part of the reason we divorced.", "It sounds like mom is teaching the son that he is at an age where he should rely on himself more and his mother less to solve his interpersonal problems", "I disagree, discomfort is not harm and children need to learn how to handle discomfort in order to become capable adults. The son is 14 and is not a baby anymore or even a little boy. Based on the facts we have (which are few) it sounds like this may be a time for the child to practice age appropriate coping skills", "Nothing about her post indicates that it\u2019s not safe.  Just that a teen kid doesn\u2019t like his dad.", "He lives with me full-time in a foreign country.  When he visits his step-dad, he has his own bedroom.", "Exactly, we need a bit more context as to what type of argument. I\u2019ve had plenty of verbal arguments with my sister over trivial things and our mom would come home to us asking her to put a stop to it. No need for a trip home if it\u2019s something like who ate the last slice of pizza.", "Honestly your son needs to learn that other people have boundaries. While he is precise, others are not and he needs to learn that sooner rather than later. He'll have many many of these arguments if he can't learn to let that shit go. \n\nNTA. He needed to stay and work through it. \n\nAlso, therapy. He needs it. This is not normal behavior. Is your son autistic?", "Then NAH. That\u2019s the worst reason I\u2019ve heard of to start an argument. Sorry you have to deal with that I\u2019m sure it gets annoying sometimes. Also with a language barrier, even a small one, that stuff will happen.", "Sounds like to me that mom wanted time alone and wasn't giving it up for anything or anyone", "True, it could be. I also wonder about the financial impacts, for example flying my kid home 4 days early for $100 versus $800 would make a big difference in my perception of what kind of problem makes it worth it. Or what their budget looks like. A ticket could be \u201cjust felt like coming home\u201d or it could be more like \u201cwe\u2019re all going to have to sacrifice for a while, but we need to get you home.\u201d"]}
