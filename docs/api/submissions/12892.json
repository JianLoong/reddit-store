I told him he won't see him again for another x months and to work it out.  \n\nA few days later,  my ex called to tell me to book a ticket because my son still wants to leave, and they aren't getting along. I told him that he is the adult and they need to work it out.  I will not buy a plane ticket.  I point out that my son will be leaving the house anyway in 4 days.

The heck with their toddler-like behaviors.", "ESH or maybe NAH. It seems as though everyone has there reasoning as to why they want things to be their way, but overall it\u2019s just not readable to please everybody. You want them to work it out (understandable) and to not have to get another ticket since I\u2019m assuming the original is round trip. He no longer wants to be there due to an argument (need context as to what about) and I\u2019ll agree is acting a bit childish. Your ex doesn\u2019t want him to leave, but for some reason won\u2019t tell him that, which would most likely fix the issue and refuses to find the ticket back that would do the same. No one really wins and no one really loses as this is supposedly over an argument that may be something trivial.", "INFO: When you say \"foreign country\", are we talking short-haul or long-haul travel costs, and how affordable/unaffordable is this for you?

However, if this is the kind of living situation he has been brought up in, it's no wonder he doesn't know how to act. He isn't equipped to deal with or voice how he's feeling because you never had his back. You say your ex would joke in ways he didn't like- but did you ever once step in and stop that from happening? Now with you refusing to buy a plane ticket back, you're showing him he can't count on your help once again. \n\nI think counseling would do you all a world of good, quite frankly.", "YTA... what are you trying to teach your son, that he can't count on you?  If so, congratulations.  You win the crap mom of the year award.", "YTA, he is a minor wanting to come back to you because he is uncomfortable. If he was an adult that would be different. As a minor, your kid deserves to feel safe in your care.", "ESH. The parents in this situation should work it out for the best interest of the child. The ex is capable of communicating with his son and buying a plane ticket for him. He is choosing to do neither. You are the mother to your child and if he is uncomfortable, he needs to removed from the situation if it isn\u2019t safe.", "INFO: Is there a reason why ex can't pay for a plane ticket?Like is he struggling financially?

You're forcing your kid to spend time with a man he's not comfortable with. Yes, he seems to have chosen to visit him, but if it's not working out anymore, he shouldn't be forced to stay. I would buy him the ticket and going forward I would tell him that if he wants to see his stepfather he will have to pay it from his allowance money, or the stepfather will have to pay. You can teach them both to be more responsible after the crisis has passed. \n\nAlso: you say your son was acting like a toddler during his fights with his step dad. Children learn from the adults in their lives. He was not at fault, he was just mimicking the behavior of his father figure.", "NTA\n\nYou son wanted to spend time with your ex, he isn't in any danger and needs to see it through.  \n\nIt is a very petty argument to have but on a serious note the need for precision is something very similar to my friends son.  He is very literal and likes for things to be precisely defined.  They had him assessed as he was having trouble at school and was diagnosed with Aspergers (called high functioning autism now).  This has helped no end as he now has the support network at school and helps him and his parents.  He is much happier now as a result of all this.  Not saying that this is the case with your son but the precision thing and the resulting arguing reminded me of my friends son.", "Yeh we kinda need more information. When I was that age I would ask my parents to fix all kinds of minor problems for me where in all honesty I needed to learn to problem solve myself and they rightly told me no. This could be that.

This led to a lot of fights between me and my ex. I kept trying to tell him he has to respect how my son likes and doesn't like joking around. \n\nUltimately,  these fights were part of the reason we divorced.", "It sounds like mom is teaching the son that he is at an age where he should rely on himself more and his mother less to solve his interpersonal problems", "I disagree, discomfort is not harm and children need to learn how to handle discomfort in order to become capable adults. The son is 14 and is not a baby anymore or even a little boy. Based on the facts we have (which are few) it sounds like this may be a time for the child to practice age appropriate coping skills", "Nothing about her post indicates that it\u2019s not safe.  Just that a teen kid doesn\u2019t like his dad.", "He lives with me full-time in a foreign country.  When he visits his step-dad, he has his own bedroom.", "Exactly, we need a bit more context as to what type of argument. I\u2019ve had plenty of verbal arguments with my sister over trivial things and our mom would come home to us asking her to put a stop to it. No need for a trip home if it\u2019s something like who ate the last slice of pizza.", "Honestly your son needs to learn that other people have boundaries. While he is precise, others are not and he needs to learn that sooner rather than later. He'll have many many of these arguments if he can't learn to let that shit go. \n\nNTA. He needed to stay and work through it. \n\nAlso, therapy. He needs it. This is not normal behavior. Is your son autistic?", "Then NAH. That\u2019s the worst reason I\u2019ve heard of to start an argument. Sorry you have to deal with that I\u2019m sure it gets annoying sometimes. Also with a language barrier, even a small one, that stuff will happen.", "Sounds like to me that mom wanted time alone and wasn't giving it up for anything or anyone", "True, it could be. I also wonder about the financial impacts, for example flying my kid home 4 days early for $100 versus $800 would make a big difference in my perception of what kind of problem makes it worth it. Or what their budget looks like. A ticket could be \u201cjust felt like coming home\u201d or it could be more like \u201cwe\u2019re all going to have to sacrifice for a while, but we need to get you home.\u201d", "I think NTA, but I feel like we need a little more context in terms of what they were arguing about. It sounds like your ex needs to grow up or pony up the dough for that ticket.", "You are 100% right. I didn't want to mention his diagnosis here, but my ex knows it too.", "Short-ish hall... about a 9 hour from airport to airport. I agree,  flexible from here on out!", "My ex doesn't like spending money unless forced to.  Yes,  he does have ASD.", "Honestly I think that editing your post to mention that his preference for exactness is due to autism would help a bit. The way its currently described makes your son look like a brat and quite immature. He expects ex step dad to accommodate his quirks but he isn't willing to understand that ESD has issues with it not being his first language. They're both being childish and need to work together on ways to communicate better and be more understanding of one another.", "9 hours is shortish??", "why are you forcing your son to visit a man who is no longer his step father. like you're forcing your kid to spend time with someone he don't need to b since yall aren't married anymore. yta. keep it up and whe he turns 18 you won't see him.anymore. you sowed your son yourenot going to be here for him probably may times over his short 14 years here", "Yeah, when I saw that, I thought the same thing. I had an overwhelming need for exactness as a child and teenager, and had to learn to manage it. I still prefer exactness now, and I find out tomorrow if I'm autistic. My need for exactness was one of the main focuses for my assessment - out of 3 hours of questions, about 30-45 minutes were on different ways I'm highly specific where other people wouldn't be", "Yes, he is.", "The other places we've lived has been about 24 hours to return.  So, yes :)", "Where does it say she forced her son to visit? She said her son planned to visit his ex step dad and she was going to then visit family for the same amount of time he planned on visiting ESD.", "Your son sounds like he needs to be taught how to behave in a way that isn\u2019t grating for other people.", "For nearly 20 years I lived in a country 24 hours' flight away, but I'd still consider anything longer than 6 hours long haul!", "You are the AH. You left out very important information while acting like your son's behavior is just petty and ridiculous. He can't change being how he is. \n\nMy best friend has an autistic son and she doesn't let him go to visit family that requires a plane ticket because she knows he doesn't understand what's involved in the mechanics of a trip and even if he wants to go, he will want to come back very quickly when the situation isn't how he wants it. \n\nYou and your ex broke up in part because he kept upsetting your son and their personalities didn't mesh. Your son should have not been sent to your ex without a back up plan or possibly not at all. This was pretty much guaranteed to happen. \n\nDid you just want a break and don't care how you got it?", "Then I'm gonna go with NTA. As someone with ASD too, I know how uncomfortable it can be. However both your son and ex agreed that your son can stay with your ex, and since your ex is some sort of father figure for your son, he's just as responsible and can just pay the plane ticket himself if it's that bad. \n\nYour son doesn't seem in danger and it's not like you abandoning him, as he definitely has a flight back, just for a later time. NTA", "My requirements for a long haul is 2 meals served lol", "Why is it wrong to need time alone?", "My husband's always on me about how specific I need questions to be, but I genuinely don't understand how anyone else doesn't require specificity. Like... We'll be watching a show, and a character will have a whole long monologue or scene diving into their thoughts & feelings across an entire season or some massive series of events and he'll be like \"have you felt like that?\" And I'm like \"felt like what? The part where he resents his mom, where he resents his illness, or when he said he loved Disneyland?\" Like... Sorry babe, your question is covering a lot of ground and I've never even been to Disneyland. I absolutely lose my mind when people expect me to understand vague pronouns (it, they, that, etc), even when I actually do, I think largely because both my mother and childhood best friend used the word \"thingy\" for everything, and communication was just a big guessing game where I had to suggest nouns to finish their sentences while they went \"nooo, the other thingy thing! The thingy! You know?\" It's the most loathsome form of communication, like playing Taboo without points. The amount of \"she told her that the thingy is theirs\" sentences I've had to parse through in my life quite possibly drove me a little insane.", "Yeah I hate ALL of that \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 I refuse to play the guessing game either unless they're going to be specific about it, like if they've forgotten the word for something and try to use thingy instead, I don't say anything and wait for a proper description, and do the same myself.\n\nLike say I forgot the word \"pan\", I'll say \"Oh, I need the thingy, you know, the round metal thing with a handle that I use for cooking?\" And wait for that sort of description from them if they're the ones who've forgotten the word", "This isn't his dad nor is it your husband. Your son should not have to be forced to stay there when he clearly doesn't want to. YTA", "YTA so you kept your son with a man who has the emotional problem solving skills of a toddler who you apparently stayed with too long despite knowing said man was an asshole specifically to your son... and now you want your son to just deal?"]}
