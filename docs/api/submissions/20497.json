None of their business where you get to sleep.  Its your plane.  They have no right to demand they get your accommodations. They are acting very entitled to your things.  You did what you told them you would. Enjoy your plane.", "NTA. She had a right to be surprised but getting upset over free accommodation and demanding you give her yours is not a great look.", "NTA. They weren't sleeping on the bare ground, they had cots. I don't see what their problem with this is.", "ESH, Everybody Sucks Here.\n\nA camping \"tent\" would mean (to everyone I know) a typical enclosed tent with a bottom and sides that zip closed. What you're describing is more like a  open-sided lean-to using a tarp. So yeah, I think you should have been more clear up front.\n\nRegardless, her reaction about it was too much.", "NTA,.. but i can understand your friend being surprised that there was no floor. photos are always good. Your friend over reacted and is an AH for feeling entitled to sleep in your plane.", "NTA.

You didn't give them a tent in the slightest, you gave them a tarp and some cots. If somebody says \"You can use my tent\" that generally includes a floor.", "NTA.  #firstworldproblems", "NTA, especially because there were cots. It's not like she was actually sleeping on the bare ground.", "NTA. Beggars cant be choosers.", "ESH. Ashley\u2019s being pretty ungracious, it\u2019s pretty clear you didn\u2019t purposefully mislead her about the tent floor, and it\u2019s pretty rude for her to demand to sleep where you\u2019re planning to sleep after you already offered to let her use your tent and (off the ground!) cot. On the other hand, the spirit of the weekend seems to be that everyone is sleeping outside in tents, so you sleeping in your plane is a little douchey.", "NTA all the way. Its a tent with cots, exactly what you said.", "ESH. Of course she was upset about not having a floor in the tent. Even if it has walls and a door, it's not going to keep bugs all the way out. She shouldn't have demanded to sleep in the plane, though.", "NTA    she was going to be sleeping on a cot, not the floor, big difference.", "YTA for lying about having a tent", "NTA. That literally is a tent and two cots?", "NTA. Beggars can't be choosers. They had no camping gear. You're the one doing them a favour be offering them a place to sleep. Sounds to me like Ashley should be grateful for your help instead of constantly coveting everything else of yours.", "NTA. She\u2019s not sleeping on the ground she\u2019s sleeping on a cot. Enjoy the plane that sounds cool at.", "NAH, poor communications on everyone\u2019s end but no bad intentions from either of you. Sucks when it happens but it\u2019s just a misunderstanding", "NTA Beggars can\u2019t be choosers", "NTA.", "NTA.\n\nThey didn't have to BUY or RENT some camping gear.\n\nGet her a t-shirt reading \"CHOOSING BEGGAR\"", "NAH", "NTA you brought them your own camping gear they didn't supply anything but complaints.\n\nAshley is welcome to sleep under the stars.\n\nNeither had any issues until they found out where you're sleeping", "So first off Ashley arrives at a camp type getaway with no camping supplies, so someone has to give her stuff to use, so OP does, and then when OP does what he usually does, which is to sleep in the plane, Ashley threw a fit and wanted that. Is that the size of it?", "Ashley is a perfect example of a choosing beggar. NTA", "But he didn't have a tent, he has a tarp covering. Everyone will expect a tent to be something that has a floor and a door that basically seals and will keep most of hte bugs out.\n\nIf you tell people you can use my tent and then they find out they are sleeping with bugs they'll be pissed off.", "Maybe bugs? No actual door? It's a tarp essentially. Not a tent.", "They aren't beggers, they stated they didn't have camping gear and he offered. Why buy a tent if OP can lend them one. No where did OP say they were begging or couldn't buy their own, simply that he offered. \n\nExcept when you offer a tent people expect a tent, not just a top cover.", "Except OP would likely have slept in is tent setup but instead he loaned it out. So then he needed to have another place to sleep and that's why he ended up sleeping in the plane.", "How is it douchey? If he had a motor home would it be douchey? They are staying outside because there isn\u2019t enough room in the cabin.  No one said there had to be tents.", "She wasn\u2019t upset until she learned that the plane was an option though.", "That said run into town buy a cheep blue tarp that\u2019s all tent floors are essentially", "I agree - I do interior camping etc. not having a floor would have surprised me and wigged me out a bit when I wasn't expecting it. Not enough to cause drama over but it would be a surprise that communicating ahead of time would have solved.\n\nNTA", "I mean.... It's camping, you be sleeping with bugs anyway", "Actually a lot have doors and are completely enclosed except no floor. Depends on which he has.", "OP is NTA. I'm from Texas, where they have rattlesnakes, water moccasins, and copperheads in addition to mosquitoes that are probably bigger than OP's plane. \nIf somebody offers me to sleep in a tent you better believe I'm going to ask if it has a floor and a door. \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc0d\n\nAshley and Jen should have asked, too", ">When that is done you have an enclosed tent with everything but a floor.\n\nLooks like there's a door to me, just lacking a floor. And since you're camping, there's going to be bugs no matter what you do. It's a a side effect of camping. (Which is why I don't camp... period.)", "If you dont like the accommodations, make sure to bring your own. I think she was wayyy over the top to demand his spot inside HIS plane", "Op offered a tent is the thing though. Don't offer a tent if all you have is a tarp.", "My thoughts exactly.", "OP says it has no floor and their problem with it was it has no floor.", "Op offered a tent, they accepted, they didn't know what the 'accomodations' were because they were misled. They didn't then have a chance to bring their own. If OP told them he has a tarp cover that fits around his plane, no floor, no sealable door and they'll be sleeping with bugs they would probably have bought a tent.\n\nIf you asked 1,000,000 people what a tent was you'd get a description of a normal tent, not a tarp cover that goes over plane wings. OP called it a tent when no one else would call that a tent.", "That\u2019s not my point they said he is douchey for sleeping in the plane.", "These are actual tents, totally enclosed with doors. They just lack a floor", "Totally agree with you on tent vs tarp.", "I see that this is the hill you\u2019ve chosen to die on \ud83d\ude02", "As opposed to yours, they are beggers without any evidence to suggest so and they should have seen into the future and realised what 99.9% of the worlds population considers a tent, OP didn't when he offered them one and thus should have known ahead of time to buy an actual tent.", "a tent or a tarp... everyone was aware they were roughing it. A surprise , yes, but they are on a cot and on a beautiful vacation.....why beg to go inside a plane?! damn beggers.", "There is a huge difference between sleeping in a tent that can be sealed from the floor and not. \n\nthey wanted to go inside the plane because they didn't want to sleep on the open ground and get bugs in their bed while they slept, not difficult. OP denied them the choice by very obviously misleading them with what he offered them.", "people sleep outside all the time, especially in a beautiful landscape like that. theres not enough of a difference to have a fit over,..unless you are a choosy begger of course."]}
