One bad nightmare shouldn\u2019t be this big of an issue", "I've been tenting for 38 years. I wouldn't assume \"tent\" means \"fully enclosed with watertight roof, walls, door, and floor\" and I would ask if someone was including a ground cloth (plastic sheet to keep the bottom of the tent off wet ground). I know backpacker tents often have minimalist features so I would clarify with someone who does backpack tenting to make sure it's not just mosquito netting or a lean-to/roof-only style. But yeah... I think OP should've clarified about the floor in advance.

I would not like that tent either, especially if they\u2019re in mosquito territory. I wouldn\u2019t sleep a wink.", "Based on his description, it sounds more like this one [here](https://www.euroga.org/system/1/user_files/files/000/045/333/45333/855c7520d/large/2950.jpg)", "I\u2019m surprised they didn\u2019t just make a version of this that has even a partial floor.

I can't imagine why Ashley would complain, especially since she also was being lent a cot...not bad digs for camping when you are borrowing everything!", "No.", "Then let them buy their own tent.", "I have camped a few times and I would definitely assume the opposite. It probably depends on one\u2019s familiarity level. Given that they didn\u2019t have their own gear, I would assume that they fall into that category. Still doesn\u2019t make him ta though.", "Same. And honestly, just the cot and a good bag/blankets would be more than enough depending on the outside weather.", "I believe there are some versions that are more enclosed. But this variety seems to be more common just based on my two second google haha... So take that all with a giant grain of salt", "Then they can buy their own tent. Beggars don\u2019t get to be choosers.", "But it was not an option for her, she just expected it to be an option for her because she wanted it.", "I'm not sure about that.  It's just as likely that he has the tarp and extra cots to help out needy people.  The dude routinely flies his plane to lakefront gatherings.  And would rather sleep in the plane.  He probably has a nice setup inside his own plane.  \n\nDidn't try to sleep with another friend (which is understandable but if it's a friendly gathering, why not keep it in that sort of mood instead of retiring to your PLANE?)", "Absolutely agree about the cot, but OP probably would have slept in the plane regardless. Otherwise, why not trade sleeping arrangements in the first place.", "I've always found it funny how many people go camping and expect it to be this like luxury vacation lol I live in northern canada, and camping is a big thing here. I grew up in the bush in a tent basically. As I've gotten older and done group camping with friends and whatnot, it always happens that someone comes along that was expecting like... a 100 thousand dollar RV instead of just tents and sleeping bags. One time one of my friends new girlfriends came, and was like shocked and astounded that we didn't have mattresses, dishes, a million blankets and pillows, and all sorts of other things to complain about. I was like, I know you didn't notice because you didn't carry anything, but everything we have with us is only what we could carry on the 12km hike in here. Which we then have to carry back out again. If you wanted big fluffy pillows, you should have brought them. I don't understand why you would agree to something like that if you weren't fully comfortable with the idea lol", "I had no idea there are floor less tents. I wouldn\u2019t have asked.", "Yup, I always clarify things like this because \"camping\" varies widely depending on the person.", "Not having a floor wasn't an issue when they learned OP was sleeping in the plane. It was just an excuse to be entitled.", "When I picture this tent being \"over the wing\", I picture a larger than average tent too. I would have been thrilled with this thing and I hate camping.", "It's described as a tarp draped over the wing, so not sure it has a door.", "No, Ashley and Jen were fine with it until Ashley asked where OP intended to sleep. Then, and only then, did she decide that she should sleep there because she did not want a tent without a floor. What difference does it make about the tent having a floor if he was also lending them cots to sleep on? Had she made that remark to me about not wanting to sleep in a tent without a floor, I would have promptly taken it down and said \"I am sorry you changed your mind about my kind offer to lend you some camping equipment for the evening.\" and gone into my plane and closed the door. HE NEVER OFFERED HER THE USE OF HIS PLANE CABIN, HE OFFERED THE USE OF A TENT AND TWO COTS and thy had no issues with it until they realized he was sleeping in his plane cabin. Ashley had an overblown sense of entitlement happening here.", "But he has two cots, so they aren't sleeping on the ground.", "I camp a lot, and have borrowed tents several times. Each time I asked for details about the tent just for stuff like\u2026 figuring out how much space it would have and if i can bring bedding or extras for it. I\u2019ve never borrowed a tent without at least getting a general size description and if it has a rain fly, and more often a full make and model. There\u2019s a huge difference between someone saying you can use their pup tent that is the size of a sleeping bag and their tent that requires four people just to set up", "Lack of planning on your part does not constitute a problem on theirs", "A quick Google search shows that some of them get pretty fancy too. Tents have certainly improved since I was dragged unwillingly out on family camping trips as a kid.", "A quick google search shows that they have a tent flap... though to be technical, you are correct. The tent does not have a *door*", "Middle of the second paragraph, it's described as a tent and fully enclosed once set up?", "They aren\u2019t enclosed then. Bugs can easily get in if there is no floor.", "Yeah that's the key. I would almost understand her point, if she had brought it up as soon as she saw it, but she was fine until there was another option that she thought was better.", "Yes, this is the key. They *were fine with the tent* until OP mentioned the plane. So even if he \u201cwasn\u2019t clear about the accommodations,\u201d they accepted it. NTA", "The ground was not the only issue mentioned lol bugs, no door etc", "I backpack a lot and have seen others Ultra Light Equipment. That's the first time I saw tents that didn't have floors and doors. They're for people up north where it's cool and bugs and snakes don't hang out. Here in Texas we just accept that our tents are going to weigh a little more.", "Expecting a tent to have a floor unless otherwise noted isn't a \"lack of planning.\" As an owner of specialty equipment, OP should realize that his equipment is non-standard and point that out to the obviously inexperienced people he is offering it to, especially when it's something that can affect their comfort.\n\nI'm big into camping and would be totally fine with this setup, but I would be surprised at first because most tents have floors. I've slept on the ground under the stars in just a bivy many times, and prefer to sleep in a hammock when possible. All of my camping gear is very minimalist, my only tent is a tiny backpacking tent. I've let people borrow my stuff before but I always point out that I don't own the type of tent they're imagining and explain how it differs from the Coleman tents they probably have experience with. Because people who need to borrow camping gear from friends probably don't know enough to realize there are possibilities beyond the standard tent, and you don't want them to find out that your gear puts them a little closer nature than they're comfortable with on the day of the event when they have no other options.\n\nIt's rude and entitled of them to demand to sleep in the plane, but it's also pretty uncool of OP to not be specific about the unique and uncommon style of shelter he is offering.", "The picture posted in this thread as an example does show a flap at the end of the wing, but none of the sides even reach the ground! So, door/flap notwithstanding, I'm with you on the 'no camping.'", "You said it wasn't a tent and just a tarp. These are tents.

I\u2019m the type who would have just slept on the cots and been really unhappy about it, but not say anything, though.", "How is it \"completely enclosed\" if it has no floor?", "The ones I\u2019ve seen have a lip that comes inward that are staked firmly across. Everything is firmly pulled and tied  they are pretty solid and also have a few inches all the way around on the ground coming in. But I guess if u want to be completely technical the ground makes it not completely enclosed. They had cots though and could have threw down a tarp if it was that big of a deal. Either way she was fine until she realized the plane was an option and beggars can\u2019t be choosers.", "People do a lot of things. That doesn't mean it is normal for everyone.

But I\u2019m in Canada and have never had a snake in my tent", "Most modern consumer camping tents do have floors, but having a floor is not an inherent part of the definition of \"tent\" as you seem to believe.", "Not all tents. Heck, our only tents are an A frame historical reenactment piece, and a historical wall tent and we've never had an issue with animals wandering in. Any tent without a floor will have a way to nail it down, and frankly it's not that time consuming. The hardest part was keeping the poles up while someone nailed things down, and having a fixed wing solves that issue. It took less time to set those up than the modern tent I used to own that had a floor built in.\n\nIf I'm in a floorless tent I'm brining a tarp for my stuff, but it's not the end of the world.", "The difference is massive and actually ridiculous to act as if it isn\u2019t.", "This guy tents", "Keep scrolling down and a few floorless models start to show up. Having a floor is not an inherent part of the definition.", "Raccoons in the night, other creatures in the night\u2026", "It\u2019s not a tarp.. it\u2019s a specialty tent meant for planes, like you would for a truck bed or SUV.. it\u2019s fully enclosed just the grass is exposed. With  two cots you\u2019re not touching the ground. This dudes NTA, I\u2019m sure your camp a lot but the multitude of different types of camping gear may not be in your wheel house.", "He had cots though?", "This would have been me too.  I would not be happy with that set up.  I could handle it, I've had worse nights in the bush, but only when equipment literally failed us and our rain fly turned out to not be rainproof.\n\nI'm a well experienced camper too.  I've just had enough shitty experiences to consider what he ended up offering as an emergency set up only, not something I'd want for what should be a casual weekend.", "More than raccoons, the mice!  I'm pretty good about not keeping food in my bags, but yeah, that situation will not dissuade chipmunk. mice and raccoons after my toothpaste, and I doubt they're stringing those essentials up in a tree like I do.", "Do you camp much? Understandable if you do not.  Enclosed means walls and top, generally, when it comes to this stuff.  Many backpacking tents also do not have floor and even require hiking pes to use as the posts. You throw a tarp down and bag on top. You are surrounded and covered by the tent to keep the elements and bugs off.... not all bugs, but even with one tha has a floor you are never keeping all bugs out. It's camping, not a hotel.\n\n- A Scout Leader", "My guess is that she just didn\u2019t really want to camp out and suddenly saw the plane as a new option for her.  OP is NTA.", "Honestly, as a heavy camper, I'd never sleep in a tent that lacks a floor or complete bug enclosure.  I technically sleep in a hammock these days, so no floor, but the hammock zips around on all sides with bug mesh on top.  Mosquitoes are absolute monsters where I live, and especially at night will get insistent about squirming into into a space.  \n\nWe have a similar set up to what he's describing that we use as a bug shelter, but especially if the ground is uneven, bugs WILL get in, and  that says nothing about the times it rains and floods underneath.\n\nI don't think I'd properly call a shelter like that \"a tent.\"  Certainly not one that I expect to sleep in.  A shelter, maybe, but not really a sleeping tent.", "I was about to comment this but you said it more eloquently than I could have."]}
