I thought it was helping my anxiety, depression, suicidal thoughts but ***it was only hurting me*** more. One night, I threw up everything I ate because I couldn't stop coughing... I hadn't taken a hit on anything in HOURS!! Has anyone ever done that.. I found myself comparing me to my dad because  I never said Alcoholics or others struggling aren't having a hard time. My father is an alcoholic which is why I had to stop and addiction runs heavy in my family...\n\nTHC, acting through cannabinoid receptors, also activates the brain\u2019s reward system, which includes regions that govern the response to healthy pleasurable behaviors such as sex and eating.   \nLike most other drugs that people misuse, THC stimulates neurons in the reward system to release the signaling chemical dopamine at levels higher than typically observed in response to natural rewarding stimuli. The surge of dopamine \u201cteaches\u201d the brain to repeat the rewarding behavior, helping account for marijuana\u2019s addictive properties.\n\nYou never know what someone else is going through. I never claimed that it hurts everyone.. just me.", "[deleted]", "Actually, teenagers are less likely to drink if their parents talk to them about the dangers of underage drinking between the ages of 8 and 12. I imagine it would be the same with weed, and the sister is still 12, so hearing from her parents would be best.", "Um\u2026 what? What does any of this have to do with my comment? Yes all drugs, prescription, over the counter, and illicit, can have adverse effects. But in this situation, kid is smoking weed. So that\u2019s the only drug that\u2019s pertinent in this discussion.", "Cool and then she\u2019ll just hide it better next time", ">So that\u2019s the only drug that\u2019s pertinent in this discussion.\n\nNo it's not. You said, \"Apples to oranges\" Did you miss the this part? \"*Your sister's going down a very dangerous path because these could mature into alcohol or more serious drugs, which again, speaking from experience but this doesn't mean you shouldn't try to get your sister help.\"* This is from my ***PERSONAL*** experiences. I've quit smoking weed and when you quit, some people suffer from marijuana use disorder, meaning that they are unable to stop using marijuana even though it\u2019s causing health and social problems in their lives. People who use marijuana, do go on to use other drugs (including ***alcohol*** and ***tobacco***)  especially if they started using marijuana at an early age and use it frequently, which again, from my personal experience's.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSorry, i realized i responded to the wrong person with the dextromethorphan comment", "You got me. OP, better let her keep doing it while you try to talk her out of it and then get in trouble when your mom finds out you've been covering for your sister and she's still damaging her brain.", "My \u201capples and oranges\u201d comment was to jm7489 bc it seemed like he was trying to say you can\u2019t be addicted to THC because it\u2019s not the same as ETOH addiction. Not a good argument, imo. \n \nConfident-try, I am totally in agreement with you and really dig the CDC stats you brought in!"]}
