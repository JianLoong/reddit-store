The area most affected is the prefrontal cortex, responsible for controlling behavior, directing attention, and inhibiting impulses. Research, which includes brain imaging, has shown that the brains of children and adults with ADHD seem to function differently than neurotypical brains. People with ADHD may compulsively seek high-dopamine activities and stimuli to achieve a dopamine rush, so people with ADHD may be more likely to engage in impulsive and risky behaviors.
