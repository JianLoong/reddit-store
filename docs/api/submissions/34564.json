It's been amazing and after two kids and loads of adventure, I still love her as much as I did when I got married to her. However, we had a silly argument yesterday, and I wanted opinions on who is right. \r  \n\r  \nFor context, when we got married, we both had good jobs, but we both come from lower-middle-class backgrounds. I have always been very careful with money and investing everything for the future as I have seen the days when we had very little. My wife on the other hand worked very hard growing up and wants to enjoy the luxuries of life. For the most part, I have been very thankful for that, as we would have never taken so many great trips or bought a beautiful house if she had not pushed me. When we got married, I did not know people spent so much on engagement rings. I thought I wanted to spend around 3K on a ring, but she wanted a specific ring, and we ended up spending around 10K. I felt that it was excessive at that time, but it made her very happy and was worth it as she wears it every day. I also love the ring as I feel proud I was able to do something nice for her that made her feel happy.\r  \n\r  \nWhen I asked her what she wanted for our 10th marriage anniversary, she told me she wanted to upgrade her engagement ring. I have never heard of this before and find it weird. The ring symbolizes something to me, and should not be just a piece of jewelry. The ring was supposed to symbolize that I wanted to be committed to her for the rest of my life. I don't see why we need to get a new ring. \r  \n\r  \n She already has a ring in mind and it costs upwards of 40K. Now, we are debt-free, and can easily afford it. I asked her if she wanted to buy something else instead. However, she is adamant that she wants a new ring and thinks I am an AH for not letting her get it. I feel like the old ring has sentimental value to me and she should wear that. She feels it's a piece of jewelry that she wears every day, so wants a new one. Do you think I am in the wrong here, and if upgrading an engagement ring is a thing a lot of people do?\r  \n", "created_utc": 1704679135, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1919gnb/aita_for_not_upgrading_my_wifes_engagement_ring/", "score": 183, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

A 10K ring a decade ago wasn't modest, and doesn't need an upgrade to a 40K version at 10 years. \n\n~~INFO: What is your wife planning for your anniversary gift?~~\n\nSaw your other replies. An engagement ring is more than just \"jewelry.\" Fine for your wife to want a bling-ring for an anniversary gift, but it doesn't have to totally replace the one you proposed with.\n\nNTA.", "What $40k present is she buying you for this anniversary?\n\nUpgraded rings at the (eg) 10 year mark is for when the original was something like $100. \n\nI cannot believe she pushed you to spend $10k in your early years when you weren\u2019t as financially secure (and thought $3k was a \u201cstretch goal\u201d) and rather than being grateful she now is trying for a MUCH larger amount. \n\nWhat $10k present did you get back then?\n\nWhat present is she planning to buy you now?", "What\u2019s your household income and net worth? \n\nIf you\u2019re worth $10mil and make $1mil a year, no big deal. But if you make $150k and net worth is under $1mil, I think a $40k ring is ridiculous.", "When my husband and I got married we couldn't afford much for our rings.  I got a $300 ring with a 50 dollar gold band.  My husband said he would get me a better ring in a year. \n\n10 years later he upgraded my wedding band to one with small diamonds and at 15 years he gave me a better engagement ring.   This was on him because he felt I deserved it.  My new band cost $600.00 and my new engagement ring cost $2,000.   I never asked for the upgrade he did it because he wanted to. \n\nI still have my original ones and love them because he gave them to me with love, I also love my upgraded ones, because he gave them to me with love. \n\n$40,000 upgrade froma $10,000 original ring is just greed.", "NTA - $10k is already a very expensive ring!", "INFO: what would this be in terms of % of household net worth? I mean if you folks are in debt I\u2019d say no, if you\u2019re Elon Musk I\u2019d say go for it?\n\nI think this is more of a bucket budget conversation rather than what the item is. Some folks would spend $40k on a luxury holiday for their anniversary, some like your wife is asking from something tangible, I\u2019m not going to yuck someone\u2019s yum, but it\u2019s a conversation about how you jointly plan to spend your household money.", "Nta.  Upgrading the ring isn\u2019t unreasonable but $40,000 on a ring is absurd.  My husband and I upgraded rings for our 18th anniversary.  He got a new one and I had my diamond reset in a new ring.", "NAH.\n\nBased on the fact you mentioned in a comment y\u2019all are multimillionaires, 40k to you is probably the equivalent of like 4k to (many) of us. A significant chunk of change? Yes! A life-changing amount? Probably not \n\nYou\u2019re not an asshole for focusing on the symbolism of the first ring, she\u2019s not an asshole for wanting something bigger if it\u2019s something you both can well afford. Imo, gifts are for the recipient, not the giver. Good luck!", "NAH\n\nShe has 10 fingers. Yall can figure this out.", "NTA - $40,000 is ridiculous.

Also, he is very pragmatic and frugal and i appreciated every penny he spent on it, regardless if its not flashy.\n\n\nOver the years he has bought me 2 beautiful anniversary bands which i wear with pride, along with my little but mighty engagement ring.", "She\u2019ll just move the goalpost. In 10 years she\u2019ll want a $80k ring. It is going to become more of a statement piece to her than actually holding any sentimental value.

Seems to me there\u2019s more on her mind that you need to uncover. Good luck.", "My wife just went in to get her engagement ring cleaned and inspected and the salesperson asked if she wanted to upgrade the ring and it was the first time either of us had even heard of this. Definitely NTA.", "\u201cNow, we are debt-free, and can easily afford it.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s your first major anniversary and it\u2019s something she really wants that is affordable for y\u2019all. She\u2019ll wear it every single day of her life. \n\nAs you said about the original ring, you spent more but \u201cit made her very happy and was worth it.\u201d\n\nTo me it seems like a no-brainer. This new ring will symbolize your commitment, how you\u2019ve grown together, and all you\u2019ve accomplished together in a decade. I think that\u2019s beautiful.", "NTA. \n\nI would not entertain these upgrades. \nThe past was the past. \n\nBesides \n\nNext is usually the eternity ring\nThen divorce ,, so begins the \nSuffer Ring \ud83d\udc40", "She's a materialist, and it is important to her to show off her prosperity. It's gross to me, but she's entitled to her own values. You'll probably have to accommodate her to maintain a peaceful home.\n\nNTA. Good luck.", "NAH - you can not want to buy it, she can want it. \n\nDoesnt make anyone an AH but dont know what that means for your relationship.", "NAH\n\nI\u2019m going to ignore the cost because you clearly said you can afford it and it is my understanding that cost is not your primary concern.\n\nAs far as the sentimental concerns go, I kind of get that, but I feel you need to perhaps have a greater understanding of what a new ring means to her to understand her take on it.\n\nAs an example, it is not uncommon for people to purchase or be gifted a solid quality car at some point in their lives but feel pride in being able to purchase a higher quality car later in life.  The cars both work fine, but the higher quality car symbolises progress, achievement, stability.  Only your wife can explain to you why it\u2019s so important to her to upgrade her ring and what the meaning is for her and even then you might not quite get it. \n\nAs for your desire for her to wear the original ring because it\u2019s sentimental to you, well that\u2019s tricky and very specific to you.  For instance, personally I would prefer my wife to wear what most signifies her commitment to our marriage, and is most meaningful and symbolic to her but that\u2019s me.  For you, the fact you could achieve the purchase of the original ring might be more meaningful for you.  But then that just highlights my point, the meaning of something can be very important and personal, and the fact that you need to dig deeper into the meaning for her regarding her desire to upgrade her ring.", "I've heard of this, but I can't imagine wearing anything worth even $10,000 on my hand every day. $40,000 would be even worse!", "3k? That was about the price of my wedding, I'd never pay that for a ring. What even. \n\nNeedless to say, I think you're NTA. \nThat said, what is she getting you? Anniversary presents go both ways no? \n\nShe has a ring, why do a newer one, that one won't be the engemant one cause you're already married! It would just be a 40k ring.", "Is extremely expensive jewelry common in her circle of friends?\nI have known women who seem fairly insecure and the jewelry is maybe reassuring to them?\n\nIf my wife said that to me, I would say that if she wanted to spend that much on herself, and that\u2019s what she wanted to spend it on, then go for it.\nBut I already gave her an engagement ring, and it would be redundant to give another.\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to upgrade your car, or other tools, as needed, but tell her you don\u2019t understand her need to upgrade, because from your point of view, the ring still serves its purpose  and you are confused why it no longer does for her.", "I offered a ring upgrade (for both of us) at our 20th, she preferred a trip to Ireland.  I\u2019ll try again in two years at our 40th anniversary.  I worked at Burger King when I bought our rings.  \n\nSentimental value is a thing too.  Reminder of the journey is what my wife cited 18 years ago.", "NTA. You went from a $3k ring when looking to a $10k ring that you couldn't afford but made happen when engaged 10yrs ago. I get how that ring represents much sacrifice and stress you took on to please your now wife. It's actually insulting she wants to get rid of that symbol of your hard work and sacrifice for a new more expensive and unnecessary piece of jewelry.", "NTA", "$40,000 for a ring?   Good lord.   I would be nervous wearing a $4,000 ring, let alone $40,000.   NTA", "The argument seems about money-that if she gets a $3000 ring she has to give something of the same value back.\n\nBut how about other things of value that don\u2019t have memory equivalents? Do you have kids? Who wrecked their body giving birth? And dealt with all the hormones? Who\u2019s the primary caregiver? Who\u2019s the one that does most housecleaning/cooking? Who shuttles kids around to birthday parties, play dates, lessons, school events? Who primarily packs lunches, makes dinners? Gets gifts for everyone including your family members?\n\nAlso, why are you belittling her need? And calling the CC argument silly? If the ring makes her happy-get her the ring.  She clearly doesn\u2019t seem to feel it\u2019s romantic to have that ring. If my husband wanted a $50,000 car (has one) then I have to have a $50,000 car to make it even. I don\u2019t want a $50,000 car but I\u2019d love a piece of serious jewelry.\n\nNot suggesting what you want has to have a price tag-I\u2019m suggesting that we should respect what someone else wants that we ourselves aren\u2019t interested in.", "NAH -- you asked her what she wanted as a gift and she told you. You don't have to give it to her if you don't want to, but she's not the A for telling you honestly what she wants.\n\nYou have admitted that money isn't the issue, and it sounds like you wouldn't object to dropping 40K on a different gift.\n\nYou're hung up on what the engagement ring means to you, and you want to try to control what it means to her -- this is where you start edging towards A territory. \n\nObviously this whole thing is very much Rich People Problems, but conflicts over gifts generally come down to not seeing why the other person might want something, so not being prepared to give it to them.\n\nPeople upgrade engagement rings all the time. They also buy rings to symbolise anniversaries. Rich women who like expensive jewellery, that is.", "Nta. My dad always bought my mom jewelry for their anniversary and as long as I can remember I picked it out. My dad has health issues and had to retire but for their 25th anniversary I went to a pawn shop found a very similar ring to my mom's original but it had extra stones so upgrade and got it for her for 100$. And then had him give it to her as her upgrade. 40k for a ring makes my brain hurt.", "Your wife sounds really superficial. 10K ten years ago is ALOT! I could see reworking it if she picked something trendy she now hates but 40K? Eff that NTA", "Ok. You can afford the ring but are hung up on the sentimentality and are asking if people upgrade rings. Yes, yes they do. Not everybody but many do. I personally got a 7 year upgrade and I often joke that it was cheaper than a divorce. (We were not in any way divorcing, just a joke). I can understand that 40,000 is a ton of money, but you asked your wife what she wanted and she told you. Up to you if you want to listen. I find it interesting that a lot of answers are about what she is getting you and as you said, you get what you want when you want it. Not every marriage is even Steven all the time. As long as you both are getting what you want and need, that is what counts. Having said all that NTA, but I would talk this through with your wife.", "I personally couldn\u2019t imagine spending 40k on a rock. What a waste of money. It\u2019s odd to be that age married that long and care about something so showey and shallow. 10k is a lot for a ring. For context, my ring cost 6k I think. 7 figure income household. Just because you can afford something doesn\u2019t mean you should spend money so frivolously. I recently got a second set because my 6k set was lost (temporarily) and I spent less. I bought a lab created diamond set for about 500 that you can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s real or not.  I think your feelings are justified to be upset about this.", "So let me get this straight... When you were financially not stable, she pushed you to buy a 10k ring. That was 10 years ago so 10k back then was worth more than it's now. \n\nAnd now she is pushing and emotionally blackmailing you to get her a 40k ring?\n\nWhat 10k and 40k gifts is she getting you? And no, a family vacation with the kids doesn't count. And even if it's a vacation, is she doing it with her own hard earned money? \n\nThis is asinine. You're NTA but your wife definitely is. In fact, show her my comment. She needs a reality check. She is extremely ungrateful and greedy and materialistic. If she wants a 40k ring then she can get it herself. You don't owe it to her. As a wife myself I could never imagine treating my husband like this. We have been married for almost 11 years now and we have never forced each other to do anything. \n\nDon't waste your hard earned money on bs like this OP. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. It\u2019s crazy enough that she push you to triple your budget when you weren\u2019t financially comfortable. Honestly, I totally understand you, clearly that ring means more to you than it is to her. That\u2019s your symbol of love and commitment to her but she sees it as a ring that\u2019s now too cheap to her liking. I think if you pour your heart out, telling her that this ring means so much to you and offer to buy her another jewelry that match well with the ring, would she agree?", "NTA\n\nThe original $10k ring was the upgrade. Why give deBeers so much of your money for unethically sourced blood diamonds?\n\nIs she getting pressure from her friend circle? Are they all rich and flaunting expensive jewelry so she feels she has to keep up? I'd be inclined to only agree if you can swap out the gemstones on her chosen upgrade for ethically sourced lab diamonds. \n\nIf you feel the need to acquiesce, then take the same amount for money for yourself and invest it, just for you.", "NTA. At any income level $40k for a ring is insane. I could think of much better things to spend $40k on \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "What kind of neighborhood/country club are you in? If your average neighbor has 25k, 40k isn\u2019t unreasonable.  If she\u2019s trying to keep up/stay ahead, this might make sense. It\u2019s something she wears 365 days/year, her desire may be something that reflects who you both are today.\n\nI have offered my wife a larger ring, but it wouldn\u2019t be appropriate for her work. Her earrings are pretty close to the same size.", "NTA. I'm like you and think the engagement ring is something that simply can't be upgraded due to the sentimental value. And upgrading to a $40 grand ring is ludicrous. \n\nFor our 10th anniversary we bought each other a different ring to wear on our right hand. Mine was a bit pricier than his so I got us a spa day too. What is she proposing to buy you of equal value anyways?", "My initial ring was decent and we could easily have upgraded it years ago but I am way too sentimental about it. It would make me sad if I was a husband whose wife had no emotional attachment to the ring I had gotten her. For our milestone anniversaries, my husband has given me other really special jewelry like earrings and necklaces, and now those hold meaning as well. It\u2019s definitely not unheard of to upgrade but I could never do it. You\u2019re NTA for being upset about it.", "NAH. It's not uncommon at 10 years. Styles change. Price tag is wild but if it's comfortably within your means I guess it's not unreasonable. It's not like you throw away the old ring, a lot of times the old stone is incorporated into the new ring or turned into a matching necklace etc.", "40k for a fucking ring?  I'll admit, I'm not a huge jewelry person, and 80% of the time I forget to put my ring on when I leave for work.  But my 5k ring with a sapphire I got to pick I love.  \n\nI'm about to hit 10 years, and I asked for a huge trip.  10 years ago, so we've saved for an experience.  We have the money, but neither of us would put money into something so materialistic.  A thing.  Tells me a lot about who she is.\n \nEdited to add NTA.  And what's your 40k anniversary gift going to be?", "I've never heard of any woman who replaces their engagement ring unless they lose it or get divorced.  I asked my wife if she had heard of this and she said never, she was pretty stunned a woman would do this.  NTA.  Don't do it, you can spend 40k on something much more important than some bling for your wife.", "NTA. JFC....I'm sorry you have to put up with someone so petty.", "What about getting an anniversary band to add on to the engagement and wedding rings?  If you don\u2019t have a problem with the money, although I can\u2019t imagine spending even the $10k on the first ring.  But if you\u2019re going to put down that much why not just get the diamond she wants and get a band that plays nice with the first two?  But NTA.", "I \"upgraded\" my ring as I was allergic and after pregnancy my body developed or started reacting. \n\nMy new ring actually costs less... it's handmade and a couple hundred.", "NTA she\u2019s being ridiculous.

It makes me happy when he does it. As it will your wife.", "Yikes- you could buy a car with that much money! Way too much to spend!", "NTA. A $40k ring is a waste of money even if you can afford it, and, personally, I'd be hurt that she didn't want to wear the original ring. Maybe go on a luxurious trip instead--something with lasting value.", "NTA but I know several women who added to their original ring on milestone anniversaries with beautiful results.  Sounds like she wants a whole new ring but there may be a nice compromise that is not nearly so expensive.", "NTA I am wearing the modest ring my husband chose for me 30 years ago when it stretched his budget to get this one. He picked it out specifically for me and it is an expression of his love to me. Full stop. I have other, more expensive jewelry he has gifted me and that I wear, but my engagement ring is the one we got engaged with. End of story.\n\nThe jewelers do have a third band option - forget what they call it- but it\u2019s basically a third band that blends with the engagement and wedding bands into one flashier unit. Maybe that?", "When my then BF proposed, my ring was valued at just over 10k USD. It was simple, 1 stone, nothing flash. In the 23 yrs I was married to him, before I divorced him, I'd never once thought about upgrading the ring. \n\nLooking back, it's just a ring. It's sitting in a safe now. I see so many being sold on the secondary market, after failed marriages.\n\nWhat I'd do instead, take the trip of a lifetime! I've traveled heaps but there are still a couple top of the bucket list trips I can think of. If I were still married, an experience with that special someone would create memories that would mean more than an upgraded ring.\n\nNTA", "NTA but you say in another comment you make over 1 million a year and have a high net worth. In that case asking for an expensive ring wouldn\u2019t be that abnormal as a gift, I think you are just hung up on the sentiment of her rings and their meaning. Which is fine, you guys just need to communicate. Maybe she doesn\u2019t understand what her original rings mean to you.", "Upgrade the ring? Nah, you\u2019ve got the money. Upgrade the wife.", "Yikes!  Am a woman and my eyes are bulging out of my head.  Get her an oompahloompah while you\u2019re at it. NTA, man.", "Price certainly sounds excessive. Maybe you could compromise by incorporating the previous stone(s) into a new ring?", "You married a gold digger......", "NTA. You don\u2019t have to buy a $40k ring if you don\u2019t want to. But I understand the urge to wear a big beautiful diamond. My ring is about $40k and I feel like the most beautiful and important woman in the world when I wear it and I love it so much. Do you ever spend a lot of money on yourself? Do you like cars or traveling? You might try to see her POV even if ultimately, it\u2019s too extravagant of a purchase for you to stomach. \n\nWould you be ok if she spent her own money on it?", "NTA. You should consult legaladvice. The engagement ring is a gift. The wife typically keeps it if a divorce occurs. Has to return it if the engagement is broken off. So if you upgrade, that 40k may just be hers and no longer a marital asset.\n\nShe may as well be asking for 40k from your bank account.", "NTA she\u2019s being materialistic \n\nWill she gift you a $40K Rolex?\n\nAnd now that you have kids, what example is she setting for when they possibly get married in the future?", "NAH, as it is differences in opinions and you need to talk through it.  That said, I know many couples where the ring has been upgraded through the years, and 10 year is usually an anniversary where I've seen it happen.", "Upgrading is a thing.  If it\u2019s an insignificant amount of money to you then why not?  \n\nIf it is more than 3mo salary, then it\u2019s a bit ridiculous.  Also, it should be coming from your desire to give her something special.  Most people would say you did that 10 years ago\u2026NTA", "NTA - diamonds don\u2019t really appreciate in value. Gold, yea. Diamonds, no. Well, unless they\u2019re the Hope diamond or something.\n\nAs a woman who went from a 4.5 carat diamond ring to a simple sapphire and diamond ring (I have both but wear the sapphire) I think it\u2019s foolish. It just makes more sense to invest that money into something else, or get a royal suite on a two week cruise and make some memories.\n\nSomething to sit on my finger to impress ppl I don\u2019t like, or make me a target to get robbed\u2026no thank you!", "Nope. NTA. I know people on both sides of the upgrade trend but not a single one would consider a $40k ring. At 20 or 25 years will it be $100k ring she wants?", "NAH\n\nKeep the engagement diamond and have it set into something else, maybe with another bigger stone or another stone of the same size. That way she gets the upgrade and you get the sentimental value of the original stone(s).\n\nAlso, fwiw, for our 20th anniversary I got an anniversary ring that I added to my original engagement/wedding set and now wear all 3 rings together.", "Your wife has lost her mind. It\u2019s just a ring. It\u2019s about who bought it and what it represents, not how much it costs. 10k for a ring is ridiculous. 40k she\u2019s lost her mind. That\u2019s selfish of her to want to take 40k and put it on her finger. Good luck.", "She has little concern for your feelings. You have sentimental value attached to that ring and she doesn't care. She just wants more...and it sounds like she wants more all the time. Cave if you must but that's crappy behavior on her part.", "Boy it\u2019s shit like this that makes me so grateful my wife doesn\u2019t want or expect these types of materialistic gifts.  If I spent 40k on a ring for her, she\u2019d divorce my ass\n\n\nOh. NTA", "If money is not the issue, I don\u2019t see the problem. That\u2019s what she wants.", "NTA. My ring was $1400. Don\u2019t want or need a replacement and $40k is just absurd. To me $40k would be a fantastic holiday not a trinket around my finger.", "NAH does it matter whether it\u2019s a thing or not? The more important question is whether you both want to do it and can afford it. If it hurts to think that she doesn\u2019t like what you could afford back even as a memento, that\u2019s a reasonable point, but not necessarily a deal breaker in my opinion. It sounds like the money isn\u2019t an issue for you, so why not look at it as building on what\u2019s already there to commemorate your marriage hitting a milestone? At 20 years, my mom and dad added a \u201cwrap\u201d to my mom\u2019s plain gold band that had a nice diamond center setting and smaller that kind of \u201cclip\u201d on to the wedding band (probably butchering the description, but basically it took the original and made it *more*).", "NAH, upgrading the ring sure exists.

If you don't get your wife a new ring, it seems like she's going to be ticked off at you, probably for a while. And if you do get her one, well, you spent a HUGE amount of money on another shiny rock for her to show off on Instagram, or whatever she thinks it's for. It seems extremely shallow to me, especially since the first ring felt very lavish at the time. Are you going to be able to convince her she doesn't need one? Probably not (sadly.)\n\nIf you decide to get her one, I guess try to make peace with it. If it becomes something you resent her for, that's extremely damaging to a relationship.

I was self-conscious about it but never said anything. \n\nI don't rember when or how the idea came up (I feel like it was after our child was born, but I could be wrong) we went together and picked out a new stone for me. I like square stones and went for an ascher cut with no visible inclusions. I returned the original radiant cut stone to my SIL to keep to keep it in my ex's family. I was *thrilled* to have a stone that was 100% my style.\n\nPlease consider, since the cost is not an issue and you have had two children and you sound like you enjoy your marriage, going with your wife to pick out her new ring... the original stone/ring could even be resized for her other hand or set into a pendant for her to wear on a necklace. If you genuinely love your wife please don't get hung up on the symbolism of that original ring! Tastes change. Your wife will spend the next few decades enjoying the new ring!!", "These comments are so rude.

You were mad and wanted others to side with you. \n\nBottom line. You asked your wife what she wanted. She told you. You don\u2019t have to like or agree with her choice. But you don\u2019t get to shame her for it, argue about it\u2019s validity or make her feel terrible or greedy for wanting it. This is what she wants.

Keep in mind that everyone will have a different opinion but it is absolutely common in many places for the engagement ring to be upgraded or changed in some fashion. Often the wedding ring is the more sentimental item that doesn\u2019t shift as much as in some marriage ceremonies that is the item that gets placed on the finger and blessed by the officiant. But not always. Everyone is different. \n\nI doubt your wife views her ring as a just a piece of jewelry. That was rude of you to write. I recommend you never say that to her - ever. You are mad that she doesn\u2019t think of it in the same exact way as you and mad she doesn\u2019t share your same values around money and how to spend it. But this doesn\u2019t mean she doesn\u2019t value her ring or consider it a visible sign of commitment. If she is wearing a ring on the special finger everyday she demonstrating that she understands it\u2019s importance. You worry if she stops wearing it not that she wants a bigger one. Stop judging her. \n\nAnyway, YTA for trying to make your wife feel bad about what she wants when YOU asked her what SHE wanted not what WE should get each other. \n\nGood luck to you.

It's been amazing and after two kids and loads of adventure, I still love her as much as I did when I got married to her. However, we had a silly argument yesterday, and I wanted opinions on who is right. \r  \n\r  \nFor context, when we got married, we both had good jobs, but we both come from lower-middle-class backgrounds. I have always been very careful with money and investing everything for the future as I have seen the days when we had very little. My wife on the other hand worked very hard growing up and wants to enjoy the luxuries of life. For the most part, I have been very thankful for that, as we would have never taken so many great trips or bought a beautiful house if she had not pushed me. When we got married, I did not know people spent so much on engagement rings. I thought I wanted to spend around 3K on a ring, but she wanted a specific ring, and we ended up spending around 10K. I felt that it was excessive at that time, but it made her very happy and was worth it as she wears it every day. I also love the ring as I feel proud I was able to do something nice for her that made her feel happy.\r  \n\r  \nWhen I asked her what she wanted for our 10th marriage anniversary, she told me she wanted to upgrade her engagement ring. I have never heard of this before and find it weird. The ring symbolizes something to me, and should not be just a piece of jewelry. The ring was supposed to symbolize that I wanted to be committed to her for the rest of my life. I don't see why we need to get a new ring. \r  \n\r  \n She already has a ring in mind and it costs upwards of 40K. Now, we are debt-free, and can easily afford it. I asked her if she wanted to buy something else instead. However, she is adamant that she wants a new ring and thinks I am an AH for not letting her get it. I feel like the old ring has sentimental value to me and she should wear that. She feels it's a piece of jewelry that she wears every day, so wants a new one. Do you think I am in the wrong here, and if upgrading an engagement ring is a thing a lot of people do?\r  \n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "Its a fairly common thing... scratch that.  I mean to say, I've heard of it.  that the concept of upgrading engagement rings has penetrated my consciousness, then its probably not that uncommon.\n\nAt any rate, not gonna lie, if my SO came to me with \"We need to buy a thing that costs 40k. No it doesn't ... do anything , its an adornment\",  my kneejerk reaction would be \"are you serious right now?  40k?\"\n\nDunno if the number of people that do something is really a good criterion for doing something.  As parents say \"if everyone jumped off a cliff, would you do it?????\"\n\nSymbols of love aside, that is a non trivial amount of money (for me at least).  Perhaps you are uber wealthy and 40k isn't a big deal.  But if we are going to dump 40k, wouldn't there be many many more things that might have some value to both of you, and/or .... useful, and even more of an investment.  you know like, a bathroom or kitchen remodel.  A whole bunch of housing maintenance stuff (new roof+tuckpointing+new HVAC).  Those aren't particularly romantic tho.   So 40k would provide a pretty kickass vacation.  very nice plane tickets, exotic locale, umbrella drinks, romantic getaway.\n\n40k just seems a lot to throw at a ring.   In case its not obvious, Marriage is great (big fan) I am far too aware of the utter scam surrounding the value of diamonds, the manufactured nonsense rules regarding the amount one should spend on a ring.   I don't mean that value is entirely unimportant to such symbols of love and commitment, but there are a lot more important aspects to those symbols.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nThat's a ridiculous flaunting of wealth and greed\nImagine the holidays and memories you could make with your family for that amount instead of an unnecessary cosmetic upgrade\n\nYou're right to treasure that original ring, you obviously worked hard to get it for her and she should appreciate that, plus everyone is right about her not doing anything for you, she obviously values herself in the relationship higher as you need to spend money to bring your own value", "Yes, people frequently upgrade wedding rings years later when they can afford it. \n\nMy husband gave me diamond stud earrings on our 10th anniversary.

What's she trying to prove? To whom?

But sorta TAH for being sensitive about it. She has to wear it everyday. If she wants a REASONABLE upgrade then thats understandable. THough I am not wearing the ring my husband proposed with. We went with white gold and it turned gold and we took it back and traded it in for rose gold. But she's not being reasonable with 40k. I also chose my engagement ring the first and second time. He just took me to pick it out and when we traded it in he wasn't there, I just sent pictures. \n\nPersonally, my husband spent $2,500 and our 5 years is coming up and I don't have a wedding band. I want a nice band. I've given him some options. He is okay with it because he didn't buy me a band at our wedding because he didn't know which is fine I am not mad nor was I. I've also been vocal about wanting a band. I wear my ring everyday and would love a band to go with it. But I've made it very clear from day 1 that I expect the band eventually but I would like to have 10 year bands added for every decade. I would prefer to have extravagant bands because I have three daughters. I want each of them to have their own band and then me be buried with just my engagement ring later on down the road. He's perfectly fine with that and I think it'll be fair for each girl to have the same band with the same significance. But at the same time I'm talking about bands that won't exceed what my actual engagement ring cost. \n\nUnless he hits the lottery. Then I'll get a big Ole diamond. Kidding we laughed at our friend who spent 12k on a ring and then had to take her to court to get it back after she cheated.", "I don\u2019t think anyone is an A H  just different opinions on what they want/value. After a decade it wouldn\u2019t be unusual that your wife has grown/changed and her style preferences may have changed too. I find a 40k present request crazy but you mentioned it\u2019s easily in your budget &  from other comments I assume you can also afford for you to gift yourself something equivalent value (like a holiday) so if it fits your budget then I don\u2019t see the issue. \n\nFwiw I have two sets of rings. One my original one I got after our 10yr anniversary. Both settings are very different to each other. I wear each still I just choose depending on what I am wearing/doing/going. Sometimes I will wear just a plain band or other days nothing at all. My personal preference is to have options I guess. My husband hates jewelry and has never in over 2 decades worn his wedding ring since our wedding day that\u2019s his preference.", "NTA, but based on the info about your financial situation neither is she. It\u2019s perfectly valid for her to desire a new engagement ring, if that\u2019s what she wants. It\u2019s also understandable that you think the original is really special and significant. I don\u2019t think either of you are in the wrong here, but you need to discuss it together and come to a conclusion.\n\nIt\u2019s a pretty common thing to do in many social groups, yes.", "NTA. Ask her if she is planning on spending 40k on you!", "NTA. My engagement ring was around 10k (custom designed) and I feel guilty about it 11 years later.  I\u2019m a nurse and hardly ever wear it - the band is platinum and quite wide so it\u2019s heavy and not great for everyday wear.  I also didn\u2019t realize how much my ring size fluctuates with the seasons, time of day, what I ate etc and it\u2019s almost always too tight or too loose. I actually want to get the band downsized to something lighter and simpler.  Most of the time I wear an incredibly thin gold plated ring I got for less than 100.  I could sell my original but we\u2019d never get back anywhere near what we paid. I wish I\u2019d gone for a simple combined engagement/wedding band. \n\nI can\u2019t even imagine wanting an upgrade ring that\u2019s 4x the price only 10 years later\u2026you\u2019re in big trouble for the 20th anniversary and beyond if this is the precedent she wants to set!", "Did she upgrade yours?", "NTA, I am a woman and that seems excessive, the sentimental value alone if the OG ring that was already expensive is what counts. I am not sure of the psychological stuff going on here but it seems weird. She could have just said she wants a ring, why a replacement ring???", "NAH.\n\nI splurged on a purse that was very expensive to me. I used it daily for over a decade and it still looked brand new. I was sick of the color though. I bought myself the same purse in a different color, because I wanted to.\n\nThere was nothing wrong w the first one. It wasn't broken or even dingy looking (it is a purse made of seat belts. Literally made to last). I just wanted something slightly different.\n\nYour wife just wants something slightly different. She's used the same one for years and just wants something different. She's not upgrading her husband or her marriage...just the thing that symbolizes those things.\n\nYou'd never expect someone to stay in the first house they got cause that signified their family. I don't think you get to decide how she wants to signify something, either.\n\nUsing my new purse made me sentimental for the old one, too. I knew how well it worked, how sustainable it was, dependable, etc. Just like she knows about you and her marriage. She just wants something bigger and better, since your relationship is also bigger and better by now.", "Your wife is fucking insane and that\u2019s all I\u2019ll say. NTA.", "This is so extravagant. Obviously so she can show it off to her friends.  She must be a very shallow person. I would never ask my husband to do something like that.", "NTA because 40k isn\u2019t just an easy amount to decide to spend although, the concept of an eternity ring or additional engagement ring is becoming more popular now and I think you should still consider gifting her a ring.", "Eh, idk. If you can \"easily\" afford a 40k ring, I can see why she wants to upgrade her 10k one. Sounds like your financial situation is amazing and she wants her ring to reflect that.", "NAH sounds like the engagement ring was already expensive. But yes, jewelry (or \"upgrades\") is a common anniversary celebration gift. $40k for a ring is insane imo, but you say that's an insignificant amount for y'all. If it's what makes her happy, and is affordable, that's why you have money. If it breaks the budget, or means there would be no other celebration as a couple, probably not the best use of funds.\n\nImportant thing to remember is that a piece of jewelry isn't worth fighting over. Celebrating your 10th anniversary in a way that makes y'all happy and let's you rejoice at your years together is, however that's done.", "I wonder what SHE will give you, if you give her that very expesive ring?", "I'm over here flabbergasted that 3k was considered a low amount lol \n\nI think an engagement ring should be about what it represents, not how shiny it is. If she wants jewelry as a gift, fine, 40k is wildly excessive, but it shouldn't replace the old ring. NTA.", "Oh hells no.", "Ooof.\n\nI can't imagine any anniversary present you could come up with that wouldn't be a major let down after she asked for a $40k gift. This seems to be setting you up for a massive blowout fight for your anniversary.\n\n\"Upgrade\" rings are a thing, but tend to be only when the original was a budget ring. Like, they couldn't afford a real diamond, so they got a cubic zirconia, which they eventual replace with a real diamond. Or, they could only afford something very inexpensive or sentimental. Poor students who propose with a Cracker Jack ring, for example, might buy a fine jewelry option once they've achieved financial stability.\n\nIt really isn't done for $10k engagement rings unless you are in a Bill Gates situation where you now make astronomical amounts of money from what you did and are hob-nobbing it with people where $100k+ rings are normal and they're all jerks who make you feel self conscious about it. \n\nSince you have sentimental attachment to the current ring, and you say you can easily afford this, you could try getting her a different piece of jewelry, such as a bracelet or necklace, or a 'right hand' ring, perhaps with a colored stone. That way she gets to start a jewelry collection, something I imagine will greatly appeal to her, while maintaining the integrity of the original engagement ring. \n\nI think you need to make absolutely certain your wife's taste for luxury isn't going to wreck your long term finances. It's a bit of an orange flag that she asked for such a huge gift  (how would she react if you said you wanted a brand new car as an anniversary present, for example?), but it is definitely a red flag that she isn't listening to your emotions or opinions about the original ring to instead pout and pitch a fit about getting a new one.\n\nGood luck, I think you're destined for a fight over this. NTA.", "NAH upgrading the engagement ring at the 10th anniversary is actually a very common practice in certain places. My cousins and my friends all did it. So the request is not unusual. If it\u2019s important to her and you can afford it then it is an ok request. However it is a lot of money and it should be a joint decision.", "NTA.  You bought her a very nice engagement ring, and I agree that upgrading it seems rather ridiculous.  Expecting $40k to be spent is definitely a bit much, though I could see a very nice alternate piece of jewelry as a gift.", "Has she considered having that ring she\u2019s been eyeing and having it designed/replicated using lab diamonds? It would be significantly cheaper. I know you said you could easily afford the 40k but I can see spending 40k on jewelry is baffling. Counter offer lab diamonds and a trip instead to celebrate.", "NTA. \n\nYeah, mine was less than $400, 38 years ago.  Never even thought to upgrade it, especially as we got more financially stable.  I can do a lot of different things with $40,000.  New car, update house, pay bills, invest, you know things.  \n\nI will add, I have heard of people upgrading before.  Usually it isn\u2019t that much of an upgrade.  She has some really outrageous expectations for my taste.

But I refuse to part with the original. It\u2019s incredibly sentimental. He, like you did with your wife, asked me to spend the rest of my life with him. Not just the next 10 years! \nI agree with another person\u2019s comment that upgrading rings is done commonly when the original was incredibly cheap or not made to last. That\u2019s not the case here. Maybe you guys can target buying your wife a nice anniversary ring for her right hand as a compromise?", "Yea it\u2019s a thing that a lot of people do and if you want to feel better about it call it an anniversary ring. \n\nYou\u2019re already losing here by wanting to know \u201cwho is right\u201d.", "My mother just gets a new ring every ten years or so.

Diamonds shrink as we get older\u2026 The new ring will represent how committed and successful your marriage is. It can be just as meaningful as the original. \n\nAnother common thing is to buy an anniversary band that can be added to the current ring or worn alone. Sounds like she knows what she wants though. \n\nNAH.", "NAH.  Upgrading a ring at 10 years is common for those who can afford it. Then, the first ring becomes a family heirloom that is used for an engagement ring for their children. There is no right or wrong here, but a conversation about the upgrade and price tag and reasoning behind it would be good for all parties involved.", "I realize I will probably be in the minority on this, but I would never spend $40K on a ring. I won\u2019t spend $40K on a car. If I was going to spend that much on an anniversary present, I would find some charitable project to donate to.

I only ever had the engagement ring, I didn\u2019t want a wedding band. If I ever remarry I\u2019d love to use my ring as I really like the design. It cost maybe $2k. I understand everyone is different but it\u2019s supposed to be a symbol of your love and commitment. If she likes expensive jewelry you can definitely buy her some but swapping out the original ring when you aren\u2019t into it seems not-loving. And it\u2019s a $10k ring.

I\u2019ve never heard of anyone upgrading a $10000 ring, that was one hell of a budget for people who weren\u2019t financially stable yet. Even for people who are well off that\u2019s generous.

Your wife's tastes are a bit excessive, though.\n\nMy wife and I also don't have quite the emotional attachment you seem to have.  A ring is a symbol.  The ring itself isn't necessarily important, but the meaning of the ring is.  The meaning of my ring or my marriage doesn't change whether I'm wearing a $1000 tungsten ceramic one, or a $30 silicone one, and I swap between the two about 50:50.  The ring is the symbol to me, not the literal piece of metal.\n\nWe got married when I was a poor college student and was only working part time, while trying to pay for my last little bit of school.  Her initial ring was about $500.  Within 1-2 years, our situation was totally different, and we traded her ring in for one that was about $3,000.  For years we both thought her ring would look killer with a 3rd band, so for our 10 year anniversary I surprised her by adding a 3rd band and a much bigger center stone, bringing it up to a $10-15,000 ring.  Might swap out a bigger center stone at the 15 or 20 year mark, but it's an incredible ring and looks amazing how it sits.\n\nBut it's all relative.  I have two friends who got engagement rings that were north of $40k, so it's all about personal taste and finances.

That's just crazy and I enjoy some luxury in my life so I'm not adverse to it, but $40K?  That's beyond just an 'upgrade'.  The fact that you clearly demonstrate your love for her after all the time you've been together and show gratitude and respect for your union, quite frankly, should be all the gift she should need.

My wife has in the mean time gotten her ring tattooed on(so have I as I refuse to wear a ring after an almost de-gloving accident, caused by a titanium ring) and also can\u2019t see the point in buying a piece of jewellery worth that much, just to show off. \n\nI told my wife as well when we got married that I will buy her anything else that she reasonably wanted, but I will not waste money on a fancy, expensive ring, and she was ok with it.", "I also asked my husband if we could upgrade my diamond (keeping the ring, only the diamond) for one of our anniversaries a few years ago. I love my ring and it means the world to me. When we got engaged, we didn\u2019t have much money and my father-in-law\u2019s company (where my husband worked) was going bankrupt. He bought me a beautiful ring for $1500 and he had to save up for it. This made it priceless to me.\n\nNow, we make 3-1/2 times what we did back then, we are relatively debt free, and I wanted a diamond that\u2019s a little more substantial for an older woman. Plus, I have larger hands for a woman and I felt it would complement my hands nicely. \n\nI suggested getting a lab created diamond because they\u2019re structurally identical to a natural diamond, they\u2019re more ethically sourced, less harmful for the environment and a lot less expensive. The diamond (3 ct. VS1, E color), was $7K and it was around $300 to have it reset. We kept my old diamond eventually we will get a matching diamond and have them made into a pair of diamond earrings. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t ask for something that expensive though. And if my husband had said his feelings would be hurt by upgrading my original diamond it would have been the end of the story for me at that point because I would never want to hurt his feelings. He\u2019s worth more to me than any diamond no matter how big it was. \n\nYou\u2019re NTA but maybe you and your wife could talk it over and find a compromise that works for you both.", "Wow, 40k on her finger. She's materialistic. NTA", "NTA. A ring that costs 10k is already a lot more than a lot of people get. Some people get pawn shop rings and some people don\u2019t get one at all. I understand she wants to live large but 40k for a RING is ridiculous!!", "I would divorce her. I already wouldn't have married someone who wants to spend 10k on a ring (even 3k is too much), she wants a 40k gift when you could not only do so much right now, but also invest better for the future\n\nLike, everything is better than a 40k ring\n\nNta", "NTA\n\nY'all haven't reached the traditional diamond anniversary.

Not very likable to be honest. \n\nNTA", "NTA - I think 10k is a huge amount for an engagement ring. The price if the ring doesn\u2019t equal how much you love her.

Your wife sounds like she'd go bankrupt in six months without you", "NTA. \n\nTake the pictures of the ring she wants to a local jeweler and see if they can make something similar with a lab diamond for a price that doesn\u2019t make you choke. Since you can afford it, I see no harm in buying her a new ring. But I have a hard time understanding why anybody would want to spend $40k on a ring. In some towns in rural America that is an entire house. If my husband were going to spend $40k on an anniversary gift for me, it had better be an amazing vacation or at least a new car. \n\nI also have a hard time believing that there is any ring on the planet that can\u2019t be made with a lab diamond for under $15k.", "NTA, I'm blown away that your wife is so entitled, do you have a good fund for college for your kids, do you have a good retirement plan?

Still my husband keeps trying to upgrade my ring or convince me to do it.  I keep saying no.  This ring has a meaning,  a history,  as it is.  It comes with memories.

A $10k ring that\u2019s only 10 years old is already really nice. My wedding set in 2017 was $1700 and I love it. We\u2019ve talked about upgrading one day maybe, but not until 25 years.

I want to use the gold and diamonds from that necklace to make the guards for my wedding set so I can actually wear and enjoy these family stones, while highlighting my original wedding set.\n\nPerhaps I\u2019m just superstitious, but I could never imagine \u201creplacing\u201d our original wedding bands!!!\n\nI *could* imagine redesigning the stones and metal from an original ring to create something more suitable later in life.

That\u2019s the high end at the jewelry store we went to. Those are the rings that we were like \u201cwow imagine if we could afford THOSE rings\u201d.", "Well a vacation is great. It's really a gift of time and memories. \n\nI truly believe that \"upgrading\" is yet another ploy from the jewellery industry to get more money. Since she seems to want something more physical of an anniversary gift, I would maybe broach the subject of another special piece of jewelry since the engagement ring means so much to you. I would hope she understands that and you could reach some sort of compromise", "Info - would you buy her another expensive piece of jewellery which isn\u2019t her engagement ring?", "Maybe she'd be willing to wear both the 10k and the 40k? That way you won't feel like the meaning of the first is lost...or less so?", "Are you getting a $40k vacation?", "Making the same doesn't mean she doesn't ask much of you. She's  still asking 40k. The only way she isn't asking much, is if she gives you the same", "My first ring was stolen. I have had 3 upgrades. One every 10 years. I\u2019ve kept all the originals except stolen one obviously. I have my eye on a ring similar in price to the one your wife wants. I have not asked for an upgrade until I tried this ring on.", "Can =/= should", "Studies actually show a mid-range ring correlates to a longer marriage! I think the sweet spot was between $500 and 2k if I remember correctly. My theory is lower means the couple is likely facing financial stress, which is a common conflict point in marriage, and higher likely means poor financial decisions or going in to debt or vanity or some other issue that comes with spending a lot of money. My ring was a bit above that sweet spot, but we could afford it and the main thing about the ring wasn\u2019t the money it was that he spent a lot of time picking out one he though would suit me and a lot of care and effort went in to the ring he knew I\u2019d wear every day for the rest of my life (I made it clear I\u2019d refuse an upgrade which he brought up - I\u2019m too sentimental and would wear the one he proposed with and the one he married me with whatever it was). He made a financial sacrifice/effort, because it was important to him, but one that wasn\u2019t detrimental to us. We\u2019re still happily married.  The ring isn\u2019t the make or break factor in a marriage whether expensive or cheap - but it can be an indicator on population level statistics which I find really interesting.", "My husband never wants anything but a trip. My volunteering to go to the middle of nowhere and wake up at 6am to get dragged up freezing mountains is most definitely a gift.", "A vacation can definitely be a gift. I received a trip for Christmas once it was lovely", ">A vacation with the kids is not a gift\n\nYes it is. I say that as a mom. Whatever brings you joy is a gift. A vacation with the whole family would be a great gift for me. I would not want anything more.", "Not only that, a vacation is such a burden. You need to clean and organise beforhand, pack and doucle check. While on vacation you can't cook properly so you need to account for that. Watch the kids. Make sure the vacationhome is left spotless or you will get cleaning fines. Come home, unpack, do extra laundry etc\n\nMore so when 1 parent feels like they are owed a vacation and the other needs to do both mental and physical work to make it happen\n\nNot to mention entertaining kids while you're there and make sure the picky eaters get a meal", "I want experiences that create memories as gifts. A vacation with my family would definitely fit the criteria.", "It can absolutely be a gift. Time with family is priceless.", "Whaaat?! If your husband pays for it, it\u2019s definitely a gift. You know how hard it is to make that happen and take an entire family on a trip? Wow, I didn\u2019t know women could be so ungrateful.", "But OP says they can afford it. So INFO, bc if they are truly loaded and have no binding budget constraint, luxuries like $40k on jewelry are fine.", "Yeah, my dad upgraded a ring for my mom on their 20th. She wears it on her right hand, and her original ring on her left.", "I'm past the 30 year mark now, and we still haven't got around to it. \n\nObviously we are both NOT jewellery people. \n\nSo not only have I not received an \"Upgrade\" ring, I have not received an original engagement ring in over 30 years. \n\nOriginally, I got no engagement ring. (We just decided, then got married about a month later). I have a simple, antique, wedding band - cost maybe $100-200? Hubby got a wedding band later, broke it gardening, and refused a replacement. \n\nIf we ever did have any spare money over the years, we could always think of something else to spend it on. \n\nThese days, I don't even wear my wedding band. Since retirement, I play in the garden too much, which makes it uncomfortable.", "My favourite piece of jewelry is my grandmother's class ring from the 30s. (Very rare for women in our culture to have access to education.)\n\nI don't usually wear it because I'm usually up to my elbows in something weird, too. Lolz", "I also do not understand it. It just seems like a lot of money. But, as you may guess, I will eventually cave in.", "Exactly. At your income, your circle is probably people with similar income. The women all probably have rings $50k-$$80k easy.", "And are multi-millionaire level wealthy, with 7 figures income per OP. Cost isn't the issue, and the kids will be just fine. Don't know why some people are ignoring that and pretending this is unaffordable when we are explicitly told it's spare cash.", "Ok, but fairly irrelevant as they are financially sound at a very young age and will be able to look after their children well.", "Yes.", "Congrats on such a lovely marriage. Hope we get there and more.", "So your greedy just like ops wife.", "A vacation with the kids is a family gift, but is not a gift for that person.", "Fair, but it\u2019s also a gift for her as I doubt she\u2019ll be staying home while he goes on vacation. She\u2019s not doing anything for HIM in that case, but for them. Hence it\u2019s not a gift. At least, not when she\u2019s demanding something that costs $40k in return.", "Making core memories is a gift but family vacations are not a gift. Family holidays are tiring. They\u2019re great and I love them but they are not recharging or relaxing in the slightest.", "I think it\u2019s less about the affordability of the $40K for the ring and more that the (back then) hugely significant (both money wise and emotion wise) gift is now expected to be simply\u2026replaced. Something that OP thought at the time that his wife would wear FOREVER - and because of that was willing to spend so much more than his original spending plan.\n\nIf this were me, I\u2019d be hurt. I\u2019d invite her to buy her own ring, to wear in addition to the original, but not to replace it.", "My husband doesn't wear his at all/most days as he can't wear them at work or it risks sleeving his hand, and I work from home so don't find myself putting mine often at all(even less with pregnancy weight!).  Pretty sure we wore them the longest ever on our wedding day - jewellery is definitely not high on our lists.", "So the thing about this post that makes me most uncomfortable here is that you're really letting people think that your wife is demanding something completely insane -- but if you are making that much money, it becomes much less extreme. I know you have said that money isn't an issue, but most people are going to think $40k is a lot and when you are bringing home a 7 figure salary (are you?) it's far less unreasonable and even starts to get into what is socially normal in your circles.\n\nAnyway. I tend to share your take more than hers -- I'm not sure I'd ever find a ring worth that kind of money -- but I really feel like you're throwing her to the reddit wolves in how you've framed this conflict. She wants an expensive gift that you can easily afford but just don't see the point of. But people are going to revel in the opportunity to call her shallow, superficial, and a \"princess\" and you're not really correcting them. It makes me side-eye how you think about your wife as a person. I can't imagine how it might make her feel.", "I think your feelings are valid, though. NAH. But I understand why you feel sentimental value is important.", "Do not cave in. This is ridiculous. Just because someone has a lot of money doesn't mean they need to spend it on frivolous bs.", "Can you get her a lab diamond for the same price? A $40k natural diamond would cost as much as a $10k lab diamond.", "Then why bother coming here to ask? That does make YTA That is high maintenance to another level and she obviously knows you\u2019ll cave! I had a $80 sterling band from Robert Redford\u2019s Sundance catalog that worked just fine.", "Don't \"cave in\". Give a loving and voluntary gift. She's an adult woman who asked you for a gift she picked out, not a child begging for something they saw once in a store window.", "I mean\u2026 this may just be me, but what\u2019s wrong with redesigning her current ring? Nicer setting, add in your children\u2019s birthstones, but keep the same sentiment. \n\nI would so much rather a partner put time into planning wonderful trips and a comfortable life together than show off jewelry, and no one know what the future holds. Given that your wife pushed for a 10,000 dollar ring when your budget was around 3,000, it seems like she\u2019s a bit superficial. And if you can afford to be and you\u2019re fine, great. But one of the things that my (very comfortable) parents have told me is that generational wealth is hard to gain and easy to lose.", "Perhaps ask if she'd instead prefer a set of earrings and necklace to match her existing engagement ring? It will feel like you're not replacing something important to you, but you can suggest it's upgrading the existing ring to a beautiful suite of jewellery to your wife to all be worn together (depending on price and design it could even be a simpler practical day to day set and a fancy pendant addition for going out).\n\nJust since the money doesn't seem to really be an issue but more the sentimentality for you. \n\nOr discuss with your wife the sentimentality of it all and how you have no problem financially getting her a new ring but you'd prefer it not be thought of as a replacement for her engagement ring. Maybe she could have it sized for her other hand?", "Fair but seeing as how you can more than afford it, you may as well give her what she wants. Since you have sentimental value to the original, talk with her. Maybe you could have the old one melted down and reuse the metal and diamonds to make a brand new ring. Think of it as the old ring being the foundation for the new ring. It evolved like your relationship.", "That sounds like a great compromise. She maintains the integrity of the original ring and still gets the bling she wants", "It\u2019s totally a gift if that\u2019s what they said they want.", "Came here to say this. ^^^\n\nAlso, is this just an issue (albeit with a couple additional zeroes than most people deal with) that could be solved with a step back and a few perspective shifts for you both? Every couple has some things/items/hobbies/interests one person values and spends time/money on that the other partner personally wouldn\u2019t bother with and likewise every couple has things that one person is sentimental about that the other one isn\u2019t. \n\nJust saying, maybe just having a chat about it (taking the $ amount out of it) might get you closer to a good path forward as a couple? \n\nCongrats on 10 years!", "No, it's insane", "Spending $40k on a major milestone isn't childish if your annual income is 7 figures. Rich people can afford frivolities.", "It\u2019s not voluntary when his wife is making it clear that he needs to buy it. Also your analogy doesn\u2019t work because it\u2019s very much like a child forcing their parent to buy something they picked out"]}
