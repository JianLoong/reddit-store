I recently obtained certification through an online school. Another teacher, let's call her Estelle (probably in her 50s), showed great interest. The thing is, it's a lot of work. The certification is pretty much self-directed and then you have to fill out a ton of paperwork, take an extensive exam and then be evaluated as a teacher. It took me well over a year to obtain mine and it was a huge pain in the ass. I explained this to Estelle and she was on board. I thought that was the end of it.\n\nThen my boss, \"Adrian\" approached me and asked if I could help Estelle enroll as she wasn't familiar with the website. I agreed and we got her signed up. Both Adrian and I stressed that it is a very intensive process and she'll have to do a lot of work. The classes are non-refundable. Estelle said yes, yes, that's fine. She paid for everything.\n\nEstelle approached me today and asked if I could help her order the materials needed. I found this a little weird as the website is pretty self explanitory and there's a big tab that says \"store\" where you order them. But okay, I was still willing to help. We get this done and that's when Estelle started asking me the same questions about the course that I already answered. She still didn't seem to get this is a *self-directed* program. They have an administrator that looks over your work, but it's on you to read the book, do the work and submit it. There are no classes to attend. \n\nLater on, she approached me again and asked if I could help her with the assignments, study, etc. I was clearly hesitant and she said \"Adrian told me you would help. I only signed up for all of this because she promised you'd help me type things up\". \n\nI went to Adrian who claimed \"it's not a lot of work\" and \"just help her out\". I asked if this came with a raise and she said no, as I'd be doing all of this off the clock. I said I'm not a teacher or administrator, I'm not doing this. Adrian wasn't happy but there's nothing legally she can do.\n\nEstelle is very upset and frantic. She says she can't do this by herself, why can't I just help her? She already sunk a lot of money into this. Some of our colleagues are on her side. They say I'm being unfair and it's not fair to Estelle that Adrian lied to her. They say she can't afford to waste the money and really needs to see this through, but she can't do it alone. The thing is, I'm the only one with this certiifcation at the school (most have a bachelors in the field, so they never did this).

If it's on your own time, you shouldn't. You shouldn't do her work for her regardless.", "NTA! Why doesn\u2019t the boss offer to help?", "NTA\n\nThis is on Adrian and Estelle. Adrian was out of his mind to volunteer your services in that way, for free!, and Estelle was out of her mind to somehow be told one thing by you and decide that meant something else entirely.\n\nShe is not out of luck. She just has to buckle down and do it herself.", "Absolutely NTA", "NTA. It\u2019s not your responsibility to help her. You\u2019re not being paid to teach Estelle the material.", "NTA and Estelle can pay you to tutor her.", "NTA. You can help her ON the clock at. work. If Adrian thinks it's so important, accommodations should be made. Otherwise, clock out and go home. Mute all communications from them during your off hours.", "You promise to help sign up that's it. You already did all the courses and passed the classes yourself, so they want you to redo it, but just put her name on the homework?", "No, you are not the ass. Let her figure it out on her own, nobody helped you so since Adrian tried to commit you to doing her work/ then she needs to be taken to HR where she can explain why she thinks it\u2019s your responsibility to help her. I would even file a grievance against both of them. Your NTA!", "NTA. Since it\u2019s not a big deal or that much extra work, let Adrian help her. Also, once she gets the same certification, she could be promoted over you. Hopefully, you\u2019re looking at other positions as well.", "NTA- if the coworkers this YTA, maybe they should help the lady.", "Adrian lied, but Estelle really should have checked with OP that she was happy to help. Especially after OP was so clear that it was demanding and self directed.\n\nI've had a colleague like this who expected me to do all her thinking for her and my sympathy is entirely with OP. I don't think it was age/generation related though, so much as lazy and not wanting to take responsibility for herself. You can find people of all ages who fit that.", "Obviously Adrian should be the one to help; after all \u201cit\u2019s not a lot of work\u201d so she should \u201cjust help her out\u201d.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Adrian was t A because it was not his place to promise your help but also Estelle is. You explained that it was self studying. It took you a zest. You can\u2019t have both jobs. Especially since they expect you to do this in your free time. Nope. Just no. She should have thought things through. And she should have asked for your help first so you would have said no and she wouldn\u2019t have signed up. You\u2019re not at fault for your bosse volunteering you without your consent or even telling you.", "Info: when she says that Adrian said you\u2019d \u201chelp me type things up,\u201d what does that mean? Is she unable to type? If so, why did she sign up for something that requires typing? Or is she illiterate, learning disabled or not a native speaker of English? I suspect helping her type things up is code for giving her the answers and entering them for her so she doesn\u2019t have to do the actual work. In other words, it sounds like she wants you to help her cheat and get a certificate that she\u2019s not actually qualified to get.\n\nSince Adrian played a key role in getting her in this mess, I\u2019d tell both of them that she apparently needs a tutor to teach her the necessary skills to do the course and suggest they work together to solve HER problem since that isn\u2019t in your job description and you don\u2019t have the bandwidth to spend your off-duty hours doing unpaid work that you never agreed to take on in the first place. \n\nMeanwhile since you now have this certification, you might consider looking for a better job. NTA.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"as I'd be doing all of this off the clock. I\" .. This is RIDICULOUS.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"and it's not fair to Estelle that Adrian lied to her.\" .. It is NOT. But that has NOTHING to do with you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\" So no one else can really help her.\" ... Still no reason for you to do it. \n\nBecause: \n\n* Your time is valuable, and you are not getting paid for that.\n* It would be cheating: If she can not swing it, she should not HAVE the certification.", "I do HR for a company that works with children and families.\nJump on the job boards and start looking.  They\u2019re going to retaliate that you\u2019re not \u201chelping\u201d (read: doing the work) for the \u201csweet older lady\u201d.   Frankly if she can\u2019t handle basic website navigation she\u2019s not smart enough for a self directed course.  \n\nWhen I\u2019m onboarding people and they are constantly struggling and needy with basic tasks I flag and give the training team a heads up. so they can monitor performance and we\u2019re not sinking too much time and money training someone who just doesn\u2019t have the capacity for managing the role.  \n\nNTA you did the work. Estelle needs to do the work.", "NTA. What a terrible boss. Such poor management that'll lead to employees doing the bare minium", "Why isn\u2019t Adrian helping her out.  Shouldn\u2019t everyone expect that of her?", "I would tell Estelle that she needs to demand that Adrian pay for the classes since she signed up under false pretenses.", "NTA, what in the world?", "WTF, Type things up for her??? You're supposed to do her work for her?\n\nNTA\n\nWhere I live, I have super helpful public librarians in the resource departments that are computer savvy and can help library patrons with computer assistance. YMMV, but it's worth a shot to send her along to someone who may have skills and training to help and would get paid for it, as it is part of their job. \n\nEither that or tell her to find some neighbor tween who could walk her through things.", "NTA.", "NTA", "NTA. AND OH HELL NO! Unless you're getting paid to tutor, that's some serious BS!", "NTA  you're not obligated to gift your time for the betterment of your colleagues.", "NTA.  If Adrian tries to force the issue tell her you will need an email spelling out the details that you are required to help coworker on your own time after hours and that the work will be unpaid.  This can be used later to turn in to the Department of Labor.   You will 100% win this.", "NTA. It may not be fair the Adrian lied to her, but it's not fair to you either. Either Adrian can help, someone else can help (even if they didn't do this program, if she needs help studying and completing assignments, others should be able to do that), or someone can pay you for your time."]}
