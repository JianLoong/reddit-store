{"id": 11996, "submission_id": "11o6dkl", "title": "AITA for refusing to help this colleague with her schooling unless I get a raise?", "selftext": "I (32F) work in a daycare. I recently obtained certification through an online school. Another teacher, let's call her Estelle (probably in her 50s), showed great interest. The thing is, it's a lot of work. The certification is pretty much self-directed and then you have to fill out a ton of paperwork, take an extensive exam and then be evaluated as a teacher. It took me well over a year to obtain mine and it was a huge pain in the ass. I explained this to Estelle and she was on board. I thought that was the end of it.\n\nThen my boss, \"Adrian\" approached me and asked if I could help Estelle enroll as she wasn't familiar with the website. I agreed and we got her signed up. Both Adrian and I stressed that it is a very intensive process and she'll have to do a lot of work. The classes are non-refundable. Estelle said yes, yes, that's fine. She paid for everything.\n\nEstelle approached me today and asked if I could help her order the materials needed. I found this a little weird as the website is pretty self explanitory and there's a big tab that says \"store\" where you order them. But okay, I was still willing to help. We get this done and that's when Estelle started asking me the same questions about the course that I already answered. She still didn't seem to get this is a *self-directed* program. They have an administrator that looks over your work, but it's on you to read the book, do the work and submit it. There are no classes to attend. \n\nLater on, she approached me again and asked if I could help her with the assignments, study, etc. I was clearly hesitant and she said \"Adrian told me you would help. I only signed up for all of this because she promised you'd help me type things up\". \n\nI went to Adrian who claimed \"it's not a lot of work\" and \"just help her out\". I asked if this came with a raise and she said no, as I'd be doing all of this off the clock. I said I'm not a teacher or administrator, I'm not doing this. Adrian wasn't happy but there's nothing legally she can do.\n\nEstelle is very upset and frantic. She says she can't do this by herself, why can't I just help her? She already sunk a lot of money into this. Some of our colleagues are on her side. They say I'm being unfair and it's not fair to Estelle that Adrian lied to her. They say she can't afford to waste the money and really needs to see this through, but she can't do it alone. The thing is, I'm the only one with this certiifcation at the school (most have a bachelors in the field, so they never did this). So no one else can really help her.\n\nAm I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1678496129, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11o6dkl/aita_for_refusing_to_help_this_colleague_with_her/", "score": 80, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
