He wasn't dropping off the baby at Sarah's family's house, he would have been taking his own baby with him.  Sarah is also that baby's family, they are sisters.  I don't know what kind of jealous/possessive thing you have going on, but you should cut it out.", "YTA. You\u2019re just being vindictive or something. There\u2019s no logical reason for why you didn\u2019t want her to go, you just didn\u2019t want her to? This smells suspicious \ud83d\ude11", "YTA\n\nThere is insecurity here, why don't you trust him with her?\nWouldn't you prefer that those two stepsiblings care for eachother and have a healthy relationship? \n\nYou're being possessive and it's not the way to go.", "YTA - both of the kids have a right to see each other and spend time together with their dad as often as possible but especially on special days. You were putting your own wants and needs above those of your child and step child. \n\nIf family means so much to you, you could have gone with them, but it sounds like there is some awkwardness between you and your partners ex so maybe that's not an option. \nRegardless, your baby going to see her sister for an hour and then coming to your parents house should not be a big deal and refusing was unfair.", "That's Sarah's half sister, correct? So Aubrey would be with her father, and sister? \n\nIt's pretty awesome Sarah feels so close to Aubrey, and great that she wants to have that relationship. I wouldn't put a hamper on it. \n\nI know you probably want to spend the whole day with your baby, but your (I presume) SO/baby's father will only be gone for a bit it sounds like. Take that time to get yourself ready, or relax, or something, and meet back up with them at your family's for lunch.\n\nIs there a reason you can't join them, tho?", "YTA isn\u2019t Sarah her step sibling? \n\nIf so that\u2019s definitely an important relationship. \n\nIf her sister wants to see her you shouldn\u2019t  say no because you think that\u2019s not family enough. If dad took her to her sister\u2019s for a few hours I don\u2019t see that as a big deal.", "YTA.  You want your daughter with her family.  Her half sister *is* her family, and so is your husband.  Not really complicated", "YTA, You should be glad that Sarah loves her sister enough to want to see her when she's not at hour home.\n\nSarah is Aubrey's family  and after parents, siblings are the most important family we have, so why do you want to  discourage that relationship? It's ok for you to take your daughter to your family's at Easter, but not ok for her dad to take her to her sister? \n\nSarah is just as much family to Aubrey as your family is and has just as much right to see her.\n\nTo be honest, it sounds like you didn't want want your husband to visit his daughter, so you have decided that your daughter cannot go to visit her sister.", "YTA. \n\nOh no your daughter would be with her HALF SISTER for a little bit of time before joining you and your family with her father later on and then HIS family, the horror. Now see if you didn't want to be an AH you should have used the excuse that it would be a very busy day for a 1 year old(which it would) but instead you wanna draw some arbitrary line in the sand that will soon enough bite you on the ass when say Sarah's birthday falls on her mother's time and she wants her sister there. There are going to be many events for Sarah in the future that may happen at her mom's place & you're not going to be able to keep doing stuff like this over and over again & think it won't impact both your relationship with your Boyfriend, but also his daughter.\n\nLike for real unless you and his ex have problems there isn't really a good reason for you to have said no to a brief visit today.", "YTA.  A child wanting to see both her father and little sister on a holiday is normal. Sarah shouldn't have been denied that because of your insecurities.", "INFO: were you invited?\n\nIf you were invited, you should have gone. That's your daughter's sister, and your stepdaughter. You all need to be able to do special events together for the children, unless there's a DAMN good reason which I don't see here.\n\nIf you were not invited, I get you not wanting to your small toddler to go without you for hours on a Holiday with people who didn't want you around for some stupid reason.", "op=YTA\n\nSarah is her family TOO.", "YTA. That's her sister, not a stranger.", "I\u2019m not getting all these votes\u2026 letting him take the baby would mean her family missed out on time with their granddaughter because when he came back they were going to see his family. And she would miss out on time\u2026 I understand older daughter wants to see her sister but the compromise there would be splitting the holiday between mom and dad so both can see her. Not taking the baby to 3 different homes\u2026 that\u2019s silly. NTA", "Oof this is tough.\n\nEveryone immediately jumping to Y T A doesn\u2019t seem to realize you\u2019d be missing out on a holiday with your child. And while Matt is her Dad, you\u2019re her Mom. Why do you have miss out because he\u2019s going to see his other daughter? So he gets to see both kids and you are alone\u2026.?? Even more true when big sis can see little sis in less than 24 hours after school.\n\nBUT\nHe\u2019s not wrong for wanting to foster their relationship and was probably excited big sis asked to see little sis. He just didn\u2019t seem to realize him granting the request was at your expense.\n\nIs a compromise available here? No taking Aubrey on holidays and leaving you without your child? But other days are good. Or you drive over separately to say hi for a few minutes and then leave with Aubrey while they finish up the visit?\n\nI can see everyone\u2019s point of view so am going with a NAH for now.", "YTA. Unless you weren\u2019t invited, you should have just gone with and taken the baby for a little bit, or swung by with the baby before going to your families.  You decided to marry someone who has children with someone else, you have to make some more concessions because of that", "Soft YTA. I get that you want your daughter to spend time with family. However her father and her half sister are also family. Perhaps there are other reasons you didn't go into as to why you felt uncomfortable with your BF taking your daughter to his ex's home. Based on what you wrote, soft YTA.", "YTA", "YTA. \"I want Audrey to spend time with her family.\" Proceeds to decline that she spend time on a major holiday with her *sister*.\n\nOP, you are in a blended family. Blended families have interesting extended family relationships. Whether you like it or not, Sarah's mom is going to play a role in Audrey's family relationships, holidays, events, and general upbringing. Sarah's mom/Matt's ex will be part of Audrey's extended family. The reason: Sarah is her sister. You better get used to that, or risk losing Matt.", "NAH. You are right. That is not her family. Why couldn\u2019t husband bring her over for a few seconds to see Audrey and bring her back? I get wanting to see her but the compromise should not be on you. You are 100% right that the only person your daughter has biological ties are the sister. The father has no right to bring over your child to his ex in laws.", "YTA. \u201cAubrey had no reason to go there\u2026\u201d - except she did. To see her sister. And spend time with her dad and sister together. How is that not a reason? Unless you had an ACTUAL competing reason to keep her home that trumps that (it conflicts with nap time, she already made a commitment to see grandma at that time, etc) you shut this down just because you want it your way.\n\nDoes Aubrey not belong to your boyfriend just as much as she belongs to you? Why doesn\u2019t he get an equal vote on when she goes places same as you? Treating him like you\u2019re the parent with a trump-card makes YTA.", "I personally would keep the two households separate. Your daughter can see his daughter at your home. There is no reason for your daughter to go to his Ex's house. When your daughter is older and she goes to visit it could make her feel like an outsider.\n\nMy ex never brought his child over to visit on holidays. They would have no connection with anybody who was there other than my child. We would be kind of course, but I think they would feel like a third wheel when their sibling wasn't with them and was spending time with other family members.\n\nBoth kids are going to face disappointments and be unhappy when they don't get their way, that is part of life. That isn't a big issue. I would start out as you mean to go on. Your daughter has no connection to that family and can see her sister at other times. There is no reason to intermingle the families any more than they are already.\n\nHe could have taken the baby to pick up the daughter and gone to the park for an hour and then brought his daughter back home. It is your daughter spending time with the older child's mother and family in their home I would object to.\n\nI do realize other families are fine with this and have one big extended family, I would not be comfortable with that myself. You and your partner have to do what works for both of you in the end.\n\nETA My child visited with their sibling at the other parent's family home and was not a member of that family. She was treated politely but it felt awkward. There, but not a part of things. At 1 your daughter wouldn't notice, at 6 or 7 she would.", "So you all saying she is TA have considered that OP's family would spend less time with Aubrey because Matt had to take her to her ex's house for her possible 1st Easter?\n\nI'm going with ESH because you could go with Matt and Aubrey to catch up with Sarah and from there going to your parents before Matt's house. If you want to be a family Sarah should be considered in the blend.", "YTA big time\n\nDon't you want Sarah to love Aubrey and feel a close sisterly bond with her?  I guess not.  \n\nThere is no possible kind, loving motive for what you did.   There isn't even an acceptable motive.  \n\nYou might want to examine what kind of a stepmother makes a decision like that.  Who did it benefit?  Who did it hurt?  Do you care about your stepdaughter's feelings and desires?  Do you care about helping to create a close blended family?  \n\nPretty sure the answer to the last question is no.

There should have been that family unit intend PLUS the half-sibling for your ex's kid to spend time with. I'm sure your family doesn't love your ex after he fucked up with you, but he still had the balls to show his face.\n\nThis event was only supposed to be for a few hours- an egg hunt, a meal. This was a Holiday, probably with activities. It's not a casual day-long hangout, I wouldn't think. Plus, I think it would be good for any cousins or whoever to get practice meeting new people and playing with others.

As your daughter gets older and can start to navigate these things herself, I hope it gets easier. Best of luck to you.", "Ok, but can she keep it civil with you during an event for the kids?", "1st paragraph: your daughter's stepmom and half-sibling never went to holidays at your place? Why not invite them all? I mean, your daughter would have hopefully wanted all of them around, and I see no reason why adults can't get along for the sake of family. You should have invited the whole family.\n\nParagraph 2: In the instance of this too thread, the man was only gone for a short time. This was a Holiday, probably with activities and only for a few hours tops. There's very little chance that the new baby would get bored with her dad and half-sister there. That's not a problem in this case.", "Nowhere does it say Sarah hates OP. It\u2019s Sarah who wanted to see her sister not Sarah\u2019s mom", "[deleted]", "We haven\u2019t had this come up often. Our daughter is only a year old so she doesn\u2019t go to a lot of events. And prior to our daughter being born a lot of Sarah\u2019s events were limited because of Covid. Usually when it does happens it\u2019s met with a lot of eye rolling and uncomfortableness. You can feel the tension.", "My daughter had a birthday party with my family and another birthday party with her father's family. Every holiday was split. She would have two Christmases, two easters, two everything. We had a parenting schedule but we worked together to make sure both families had access. Her Dad's parents were the ones hosting these events and her dad would visit there.\n\nWhen she was older, she would visit dad and stepmom with stepmom's family and that was awkward. My daughter loved having two parties for everything, and she never knew another way. Her father and stepmom were not as good to her as his parents were. She is an adult and NC with dad and stepmom and has some contact with her half sibling who lives with his parents in another state. One grandparent is still living and they moved to the state their son is in and she is still close with her.", "Except the sisters can spend time together without the other mom involved, seeing as how the other mom literally does not want to be involved in respecting stepmom. Can't force people to coparent, as tragic as it is.", "There's only one Easter day. Really, most families can only afford one Sweet 16 bash as well. There's only one place you can wake up on Christmas morning. In my opinion, it is better for the adults to be able to get along. In the case of your daughter, if her stepmom was being a half-decent parent at all, she probably would have wanted her whole family to go to eat together after her recitals and eat a Thanksgiving meal together or something. Personally, I also think that it shows a good example of maturity to children as well to not act awkward around other adults for a period of many years at a time. There are benefits to having family events together- like in the case of the original post where the baby probably wants her mommy but she ALSO wants to egg hunt with her sister for once. It doesn't work for everyone, but I think it would have been worth a shot here if OP was ever invited properly.", "[deleted]", "My family had Christmas Eve, the grandparents had her after our party overnight and spent Christmas morning with them. They had her easter morning usually and my family had a gathering around 1 or 2 pm. I had a great relationship with her grandparents. His GF then wife didn't want my daughter around when she was little, she changed her mind when she was 6 or 7.", ">Not that she was disrespectful or didn\u2019t invite her.\n\nUmm, I'm sorry, but if you let your dislike of someone be a reason for them not to bring their child to your party, you are disrespectful AF and you might as well have not invited them. That's just how things are. People can dislike people, but if they are parents they have to be a lot more mature about it.\n\n>They deserve holidays together.\n\nOP only has custody of one kid. OP cannot control that the sister is spending Easter with a vidnictive, toxic woman. That's a good enough reason to keep her child away.\n\n>Y\u2019all also need to recognize Aubrey is that man\u2019s child. He is her father. He can quite literally tell OP to fuck off and take his child wherever he pleases for an hour.\n\nBut he damn well shouldn't be taking his toddler to this woman's home if this vidnictive, toxic woman has made it difficult for no reason for the toddler's mom to attend whilst the toddler is so little as to need her mother. Period. They can have an egg hunt later, they can make all sorts of arrangements I hope, but the little girl should not be alienated from her mother on these Holidays for no good reason. It distinctly seems like someone other than OP is the one who is forcing this difficult choice."]}
