Last year, my brother and SIL moved her to private school since she was getting bullied and she'd gone from an A to a F student. But even a year in, she was still failing. \n\nI knew what she was going through, I'd had some traumatic experiences from my first boss. And even when I quit, PTSD from that cost me my next job too.\n\nOne day she called me upset about it, and I told her I could relate. My first boss was a terrible \"bully\" who really hurt and scared me, (understatement but I had to keep it PG) and for years after I quit I'd be as upset as if it had been yesterday. I'd spend my nights wondering if he was right, or I deserved it somehow. I asked if that's how she felt. She said yeah, and she really wanted to know how to make it stop. \n\nI told her that I started seeing him as dead to me. I'd never have to see him again. For all I knew, he might really be dead. But it didn't matter; in my heart he's been dead for a long time. \n\nShe said she didn't know how to do that, they literally aren't dead. I said that this might sound a little woo-woo but there was an idea my therapist had, that really helped me, burning things that held bad memories. She wanted to try, and my brother said it was fine with him.\n\nSo she put everything that reminded her of the bullies into a box. And if it was online, she sent me a link and I would print it out.\n\nThen one evening, she went through her box at my place, by my fire pit, and we talked a lot about each thing and the memories she needed to get off her chest before she burned it. \n\nAfterwards, I read a bit of writing that I'll share here for context later .. \"Ashes to ashes, dust to dust. All the universe gives us, it takes back in time. You've been given pain you didn't deserve, and you've been carrying it with you ever since. It's time to let go. This box, where you've gathered your pain, is but ash now. The wind will scatter it, till no trace is left. Let us lay (bullies names) to rest in your heart. Let this be the last their names are spoken, if that is your wish. \n\nThat night, she thanked me for it all, and it had obviously been really cathartic. She also asked me if she could keep what I wrote, and I said yeah. \n\nShe told a few friends at school about what we did, and the school administration heard and got concerned, some of it got taken out of context. \n\nThe school called her mom (my sister in law) and she went through her things and found the writing I did, and she called me, literally accusing me of doing witchcraft, which I honestly started laughing at because if I was a witch I wouldn't be so broke. \n\nShe was furious and said I was making jokes when I'd really overstepped, not being her parent, and it was totally inappropriate of me to give the advice \"they're dead to me\" to a kid about other kids. My brother agreed with her.\n\nAITA for the advice I gave, and was I overstepping?\n\nEdit... I was not expecting to have to explain this in the year 2023 but... Can we all please at least agree that\n\n1. Witches who can do death spells are some fictional Harry Potter style shit, they're not real. No disrespect to people who practice spirituality / wicca / etc, but that's not what we're talking about here, the kind of \"witchcraft\" my SIL accused me of doing was the \"Evil hag curses children with death\" sort that only exists in storybooks. \n\n2. Even if there was such a thing as a real witch who could kill with their mind, I am not one, and I am not trying to be one. I said this as a joke at first, but seriously... If I was a witch, I'd be casting some spells to magic my bills away, not some little kids!! \n\n3. I find it fucking ridiculous that I have to explain this to anyone born after the year 1650. I'm not gonna argue any more in the comments about whether I'm a witch.

They also rely heavily on interpretations of meditation and therapeutic practices. Your non witchcraft is hitting similar chords to modern witchcraft, which is often extremely misunderstood.\n\nEven if they weren\u2019t actually similar, young adult girls making that type of speech while surrounding a fire is going to flag Western/Christian fears about witchcraft.

And that kind of letting go ritual is one I've heard from my therapist.  In fact, every year we write things on pieces of paper we want to release and burn them.   \n\nHumans have always used rituals.  Coming of age rituals come to mind.  I'm sure you've heard of them in other cultures, where someone does X and they are a man or woman.  They're not necessarily \"magical\" in the sense your niece's mom thinks of it.  \n\nDon't worry about your niece's mom's complaining.", "NAH. I see it from both perspectives, and it is completely up to the individual. Some people have dealt with bullying as you have. Some can't visualize people as being dead to them, even the worst people. But I think you should respect her wishes to not go full on with the \"dead to them\" thing if she is uncomfortable with it.", "NTA.  You did a good thing.", "NTA.  \n\nPerhaps you could explain that ceremony is part of life in every culture. From christenings, birthdays, to graduations, weddings, and funerals for a reason.  \nThey help us to psychologically close one chapter and prepare to begin another. Ceremony / Ritual is there to mark the importance and brevity of these transitions.  \n\nThe burning of the items which symbolized for her the intensely painful, negative emotions of her bullying experience, coupled with the solemn acknowledgement of the trauma attached to each item / memory; you utilized the art of ceremony to allow her to psychologically set them down as they were placed into the fire.  The fire served to visually symbolize the release of the Bully\u2019s emotional power over her in a tangible, visible way.  \n\nBy using ceremony, instead of physical/verbal retaliation / vengeance / escalation with the bully - your niece was afforded a safe space to speak her truth about the experience, feel heard, validated and given the permission and agency to lay it to rest.   \n\nIt is not that the bully is dead to her insomuch as the POWER and FEAR the Bully had over her is dead to her. That is what needs to be clarified. She\u2019s not sticking pins into voodoo dolls and plotting destruction.  She\u2019s symbolically cutting off their power supply from her perception. \n\nSaying words of meaning over a ritual or ceremony is inherently human. You\u2019ll find it at every Briss, Baptism, Bar Mitzvah, Wedding, Divorce, Funeral etc., Every culture engages in symbolic ceremony.  This moment you respectfully shared with your niece is no different. \n\nTo have someone acknowledge, support and help you work through pain like this as a young teenager is more valuable and positive an impact than one could possibly overstate. \n\nGood job Auntie - a vulnerable 14 year old girl feels heard, seen and more confident in her power to overcome. Show me a person on earth who couldn\u2019t use a little more of that.  \n\nNTA \n\nPLEASE! PLEASE!

Okay, like none of that is technically incorrect?

My family doctor told me (and mind you he's an MD and sworn to do no harm!) He said to just get the bullies aside and beat em up. I was like, no way! you do realize I'm the one gonna get in trouble for that, not them?! He said yeah but it would be worth it because they'd stop bullying me. I said, yep they would-- because I'd be in kid-jail!! Then I walked out and never went back. I was about 11 at the time.\n\nYou are NTA no way no how, your advice worked, it helped her deal, and I wish I'd had it back-when myself!", "NTA\n\nYou offered a ritual that provides a sense of closure. Hell when I was in college burning assignments at the end of a tough year at a bonfire on the beach was a thing. A cathartic moment to release the emotions and move on, instead of dwelling on them.\n\nI can understand the school being concerned when they are getting distorted information, especially involving fire.\n\nBut geez to claim it\u2019s witchcraft is ridiculous. Also children aren\u2019t property - this notion that they themselves especially as teenagers can\u2019t seek out support from an adult they trust is bullshit. Parents shouldn\u2019t isolate their kids from expanded support systems.\n\nYou didn\u2019t overstep because your niece reached out to you. She\u2019s 14, not 9.

Separating because I don't want this to count as an actual vote of y ta and I'll tell you why. \n\nYour intentions were absolutely in the right. You supporting your niece during a tough time in her life is commendable. You standing up for her when her parents seem to be failing to provide the necessary support proves you didn't intend to harm her in any way. So you're technically not the AH in this situation. \n\nHowever, therapy is a very nuanced thing. You have to know how to approach it and it's very different for each person. What works for you may not work for me. You need a professional to guide you to untangle the mess and provide the right approach to heal you. In this case, you took a chance that what worked for you would automatically work for your niece. From your comments, it seems like your niece took it the way you intended, and that's where you got lucky. Because this could have backfired just as easily. And at the tender age of 14, you shouldn't teach her something that might stay ingrained forever, if you're not 100% sure it'll work.\nAnd particularly about death and related topics, it's best to be careful what you say. I know someone who is extremely apathetic to death and funerals (even of close ones) because when they cut people out of their lives, they consider them dead. It probably diminished the actual value of what death means to them. \nI think what you could have done, is set up an appointment for your niece with your therapist, after discussing with your brother and SIL. And always be a safe space for your niece to talk about whatever they're going through. \n\nOverall, NTA because many people just overlook teens being bullied and call it teenage drama. You didn't. Kudos on that.\n\n\nEdited to add actual verdict right on top.", "NTA.

Then she told friends, and it became gossip. Then the school became involved.

You apparently know very little about it and it shows in your words on here.

But if I phrase it like that it sounds kinda mean doesn't it? Rather than saying that it's a religious practice like any other. Catholics have tons of physical rituals but is seen as \"ok\" or \"acceptable\" but pagan rituals are \"crazy\" and \"wrong/bad\". \n\nThe fact that your family members seem to be the flavor of religious that see \"witchcraft\" as a product of \"the devil\". I would think you would know this about your family especially if they specifically sent your niece to a fully religious school.
