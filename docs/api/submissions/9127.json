Last year, my brother and SIL moved her to private school since she was getting bullied and she'd gone from an A to a F student. But even a year in, she was still failing. \n\nI knew what she was going through, I'd had some traumatic experiences from my first boss. And even when I quit, PTSD from that cost me my next job too.\n\nOne day she called me upset about it, and I told her I could relate. My first boss was a terrible \"bully\" who really hurt and scared me, (understatement but I had to keep it PG) and for years after I quit I'd be as upset as if it had been yesterday. I'd spend my nights wondering if he was right, or I deserved it somehow. I asked if that's how she felt. She said yeah, and she really wanted to know how to make it stop. \n\nI told her that I started seeing him as dead to me. I'd never have to see him again. For all I knew, he might really be dead. But it didn't matter; in my heart he's been dead for a long time. \n\nShe said she didn't know how to do that, they literally aren't dead. I said that this might sound a little woo-woo but there was an idea my therapist had, that really helped me, burning things that held bad memories. She wanted to try, and my brother said it was fine with him.\n\nSo she put everything that reminded her of the bullies into a box. And if it was online, she sent me a link and I would print it out.\n\nThen one evening, she went through her box at my place, by my fire pit, and we talked a lot about each thing and the memories she needed to get off her chest before she burned it. \n\nAfterwards, I read a bit of writing that I'll share here for context later .. \"Ashes to ashes, dust to dust. All the universe gives us, it takes back in time. You've been given pain you didn't deserve, and you've been carrying it with you ever since. It's time to let go. This box, where you've gathered your pain, is but ash now. The wind will scatter it, till no trace is left. Let us lay (bullies names) to rest in your heart. Let this be the last their names are spoken, if that is your wish. \n\nThat night, she thanked me for it all, and it had obviously been really cathartic. She also asked me if she could keep what I wrote, and I said yeah. \n\nShe told a few friends at school about what we did, and the school administration heard and got concerned, some of it got taken out of context. \n\nThe school called her mom (my sister in law) and she went through her things and found the writing I did, and she called me, literally accusing me of doing witchcraft, which I honestly started laughing at because if I was a witch I wouldn't be so broke. \n\nShe was furious and said I was making jokes when I'd really overstepped, not being her parent, and it was totally inappropriate of me to give the advice \"they're dead to me\" to a kid about other kids. My brother agreed with her.\n\nAITA for the advice I gave, and was I overstepping?\n\nEdit... I was not expecting to have to explain this in the year 2023 but... Can we all please at least agree that\n\n1. Witches who can do death spells are some fictional Harry Potter style shit, they're not real. No disrespect to people who practice spirituality / wicca / etc, but that's not what we're talking about here, the kind of \"witchcraft\" my SIL accused me of doing was the \"Evil hag curses children with death\" sort that only exists in storybooks. \n\n2. Even if there was such a thing as a real witch who could kill with their mind, I am not one, and I am not trying to be one. I said this as a joke at first, but seriously... If I was a witch, I'd be casting some spells to magic my bills away, not some little kids!! \n\n3. I find it fucking ridiculous that I have to explain this to anyone born after the year 1650. I'm not gonna argue any more in the comments about whether I'm a witch.

They also rely heavily on interpretations of meditation and therapeutic practices. Your non witchcraft is hitting similar chords to modern witchcraft, which is often extremely misunderstood.\n\nEven if they weren\u2019t actually similar, young adult girls making that type of speech while surrounding a fire is going to flag Western/Christian fears about witchcraft.

And that kind of letting go ritual is one I've heard from my therapist.  In fact, every year we write things on pieces of paper we want to release and burn them.   \n\nHumans have always used rituals.  Coming of age rituals come to mind.  I'm sure you've heard of them in other cultures, where someone does X and they are a man or woman.  They're not necessarily \"magical\" in the sense your niece's mom thinks of it.  \n\nDon't worry about your niece's mom's complaining.", "NAH. I see it from both perspectives, and it is completely up to the individual. Some people have dealt with bullying as you have. Some can't visualize people as being dead to them, even the worst people. But I think you should respect her wishes to not go full on with the \"dead to them\" thing if she is uncomfortable with it.", "NTA.  You did a good thing.", "NTA.  \n\nPerhaps you could explain that ceremony is part of life in every culture. From christenings, birthdays, to graduations, weddings, and funerals for a reason.  \nThey help us to psychologically close one chapter and prepare to begin another. Ceremony / Ritual is there to mark the importance and brevity of these transitions.  \n\nThe burning of the items which symbolized for her the intensely painful, negative emotions of her bullying experience, coupled with the solemn acknowledgement of the trauma attached to each item / memory; you utilized the art of ceremony to allow her to psychologically set them down as they were placed into the fire.  The fire served to visually symbolize the release of the Bully\u2019s emotional power over her in a tangible, visible way.  \n\nBy using ceremony, instead of physical/verbal retaliation / vengeance / escalation with the bully - your niece was afforded a safe space to speak her truth about the experience, feel heard, validated and given the permission and agency to lay it to rest.   \n\nIt is not that the bully is dead to her insomuch as the POWER and FEAR the Bully had over her is dead to her. That is what needs to be clarified. She\u2019s not sticking pins into voodoo dolls and plotting destruction.  She\u2019s symbolically cutting off their power supply from her perception. \n\nSaying words of meaning over a ritual or ceremony is inherently human. You\u2019ll find it at every Briss, Baptism, Bar Mitzvah, Wedding, Divorce, Funeral etc., Every culture engages in symbolic ceremony.  This moment you respectfully shared with your niece is no different. \n\nTo have someone acknowledge, support and help you work through pain like this as a young teenager is more valuable and positive an impact than one could possibly overstate. \n\nGood job Auntie - a vulnerable 14 year old girl feels heard, seen and more confident in her power to overcome. Show me a person on earth who couldn\u2019t use a little more of that.  \n\nNTA \n\nPLEASE! PLEASE!

Okay, like none of that is technically incorrect?

Because it's not her responsibility if they hurt anyone else, it's their fault, and the fault of any teachers or school administrators or parents that have a real responsibility to stop it, and let it happen \n\nI felt like she had a deep understanding that this was a symbolic thing, meant for her own healing and closure and that it had nothing to do with literal death. \n\nThe only people who were saying anything at all about rituals or witchcraft or literal death were adults.

The legal system during that time certainly wasn\u2019t monolithic, so it\u2019s hard to make any sweeping generalizations (but that won\u2019t stop me!)\n\nBroadly, there was more leeway than you think.  Being accused of a witch wasn\u2019t always an instant death sentence.  To (over)-simplify, a lot of times an accusation of witchcraft would pit local authorities against more regional authorities, because (very generally) local authorities were usually not allowed to pronounce a sentence of death and carry it out without any oversight.\n\nSo you\u2019d occasionally have cases where local authorities wanted someone put to death, and regional authorities told them to pound sand and stop being ridiculous.  (Which sort of happened with the Salem Witch Trials, after regional authorities caught  wind of what was going on and stepped in.)\n\nOther times, when the push to discover witches came from the more centralized government, sometimes local authorities would push back.  Some of the witch tests could be manipulated.  For example, I remember one test of witchcraft was to injure the witch (with a burn or branding of some sort?) and see how the burn healed after X days.  If you had sympathetic townspeople sneaking into the jails and cleaning and bandaging the wound, it\u2019s going to heal a lot better (which would mean you weren\u2019t a witch.)\n\nYou\u2019d see records of the witchfinder general (or whomever) moving from place to place to \u201cinvestigate\u201d witchcraft, and the conviction/death rates would be pretty high\u2026and then they\u2019d get to another place, and the conviction rates would drop through the floor.  Of course, it\u2019s impossible to know for sure, but a likely conclusion is civil disobedience from people who knew and liked these women and weren\u2019t going to be a part of that nonsense.  They could refuse to testify (or at least refuse to give damning testimony), help manipulate tests for better outcomes, etc.\n\nI always found that to be so hopeful, that even with something as unjust and irrational as witch trials, there were common people, both men and women, who recognized it was bullshit and they weren\u2019t going to take it.", "Ok.
