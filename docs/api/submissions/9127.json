And even when I quit, PTSD from that cost me my next job too.\n\nOne day she called me upset about it, and I told her I could relate. My first boss was a terrible \"bully\" who really hurt and scared me, (understatement but I had to keep it PG) and for years after I quit I'd be as upset as if it had been yesterday. I'd spend my nights wondering if he was right, or I deserved it somehow. I asked if that's how she felt. She said yeah, and she really wanted to know how to make it stop. \n\nI told her that I started seeing him as dead to me. I'd never have to see him again. For all I knew, he might really be dead. But it didn't matter; in my heart he's been dead for a long time. \n\nShe said she didn't know how to do that, they literally aren't dead. I said that this might sound a little woo-woo but there was an idea my therapist had, that really helped me, burning things that held bad memories. She wanted to try, and my brother said it was fine with him.\n\nSo she put everything that reminded her of the bullies into a box. And if it was online, she sent me a link and I would print it out.\n\nThen one evening, she went through her box at my place, by my fire pit, and we talked a lot about each thing and the memories she needed to get off her chest before she burned it. \n\nAfterwards, I read a bit of writing that I'll share here for context later .. \"Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

They also rely heavily on interpretations of meditation and therapeutic practices. Your non witchcraft is hitting similar chords to modern witchcraft, which is often extremely misunderstood.\n\nEven if they weren\u2019t actually similar, young adult girls making that type of speech while surrounding a fire is going to flag Western/Christian fears about witchcraft.

And that kind of letting go ritual is one I've heard from my therapist.  In fact, every year we write things on pieces of paper we want to release and burn them.   \n\nHumans have always used rituals.  Coming of age rituals come to mind.  I'm sure you've heard of them in other cultures, where someone does X and they are a man or woman.  They're not necessarily \"magical\" in the sense your niece's mom thinks of it.  \n\nDon't worry about your niece's mom's complaining.", "NAH. I see it from both perspectives, and it is completely up to the individual. Some people have dealt with bullying as you have. Some can't visualize people as being dead to them, even the worst people. But I think you should respect her wishes to not go full on with the \"dead to them\" thing if she is uncomfortable with it.", "NTA.  You did a good thing.", "NTA.  \n\nPerhaps you could explain that ceremony is part of life in every culture. From christenings, birthdays, to graduations, weddings, and funerals for a reason.  \nThey help us to psychologically close one chapter and prepare to begin another. Ceremony / Ritual is there to mark the importance and brevity of these transitions.  \n\nThe burning of the items which symbolized for her the intensely painful, negative emotions of her bullying experience, coupled with the solemn acknowledgement of the trauma attached to each item / memory; you utilized the art of ceremony to allow her to psychologically set them down as they were placed into the fire.  The fire served to visually symbolize the release of the Bully\u2019s emotional power over her in a tangible, visible way.  \n\nBy using ceremony, instead of physical/verbal retaliation / vengeance / escalation with the bully - your niece was afforded a safe space to speak her truth about the experience, feel heard, validated and given the permission and agency to lay it to rest.   \n\nIt is not that the bully is dead to her insomuch as the POWER and FEAR the Bully had over her is dead to her. That is what needs to be clarified. She\u2019s not sticking pins into voodoo dolls and plotting destruction.  She\u2019s symbolically cutting off their power supply from her perception. \n\nSaying words of meaning over a ritual or ceremony is inherently human. You\u2019ll find it at every Briss, Baptism, Bar Mitzvah, Wedding, Divorce, Funeral etc., Every culture engages in symbolic ceremony.  This moment you respectfully shared with your niece is no different. \n\nTo have someone acknowledge, support and help you work through pain like this as a young teenager is more valuable and positive an impact than one could possibly overstate. \n\nGood job Auntie - a vulnerable 14 year old girl feels heard, seen and more confident in her power to overcome. Show me a person on earth who couldn\u2019t use a little more of that.  \n\nNTA \n\nPLEASE! PLEASE!

What I don't understand is that your brother agreed to the therapeutic burning ceremony (which has been around since the Salem witches' trials, just kidding, but it has been around for ages), and now he's siding with your SIL? I think with the backstory going down a rabbit hole, this calls for a sit-down, a deep discussion between you, your brother, and SIL to clear the air about the symbolism of what was written to exorcise the bullies from their daughter's life as you had done yours.

Okay, like none of that is technically incorrect? But it was taken so far out of context by the time she heard about it that it probably sounded nearer to an accusation I was having her daughter try to put curses on people or some shit, than what was really happening which was me teaching my niece a harmless way to release emotions, that my therapist taught me.", "It is a religious private school, yeah.\n\nShe's really been feeling better and a lot more confident since then, she's started spending more time with friends and her academics are getting better, so I honestly feel kinda mad that her parents are mad at me for helping but never did much to help themselves... \n\nI feel like my brother and his wife were too focused on the academic side of stuff, seeing it as a problem that they had a problem student...

TODAY!", "You're awesome!", "This!!!", "I totally agree about the therapy part, TBH I think that'd help her a lot more than I was able to, but that's not possible financially for her family right now. \n\nI was honestly trying to help the best way I knew, she asked me what worked for me since I'd been through the same shit, and I said what worked for me.

And how even though we both know those girls were probably out there still doing the same cruel stuff, she deserved the healing of closing that chapter of her life and not bearing that burden of feeling responsible for the next victim forever. Because it's not her responsibility if they hurt anyone else, it's their fault, and the fault of any teachers or school administrators or parents that have a real responsibility to stop it, and let it happen \n\nI felt like she had a deep understanding that this was a symbolic thing, meant for her own healing and closure and that it had nothing to do with literal death. \n\nThe only people who were saying anything at all about rituals or witchcraft or literal death were adults. My neice and her friends understood it was a symbolic gesture. And quite frankly, the misinterpreting came 100% from school administrators, and my sister in law. \n\nAdults I would have hoped would have the maturity to know that literal witchcraft isn't real, nobody's putting a goddamn spell on anyone, and life isn't a Harry Potter book...", "The problem is that her parents were obviously one track minded regarding the effects the bullying had on their daughter.
