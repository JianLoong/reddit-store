When you adult you can't just take days of with consequences.", "NTA shit sucks but if you cant get PTO for it and you cant afford to lose the job or miss the shift then thats the end of it", "NTA. You're an adult with responsibilities. I don't know what employment law is like where you live, but if a colleague spotted you or saw social media posts about you going out, you could get in a lot of trouble at work.", "NTA, and the only thing that would make that change in my mind is if you had much more lead time to try and get that particular day off but procrastinated and it became too late.", "I immediately lose respect for anyone who suggests pulling sickies. NTA. It\u2019s just a party, nobody\u2019s gonna die from lack of attendance, but you may lose your job if you do not go.", "calling in sick when you're not sick is an epidemic.  You kids need to stop that.  It is not good to be unreliable, and then you get a smaller paycheck after you forget why you took the day in the first place", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
