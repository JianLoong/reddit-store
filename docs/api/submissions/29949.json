Sometimes, not as much because I have other plans for the day such as finishing my school works so I don't have to cram it later.

Your parents need to talk to your aunt and say \u201cWe understand you have your reasons for practically moving into our home, but my child\u2019s room is off limits to your family.

You really need him to protect you and your home.\n\nUntil your dad grows a spine the best you can do is lock your room and keep asserting to your dad that this is something you can't budge on to retain the last space in the house that is free of their chaos. You need that sanctuary at the very least.\n\nYou don't owe your cousin one more bed to jump on. That doesn't even make sense.
