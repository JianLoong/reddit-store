She has given me the treatment for taking too long in the shower and using all the hot water. She broke down yell-crying at me one day because I was an hour late coming home, and I didn\u2019t answer the phone (there was traffic due to a wreck and I don\u2019t get messages or calls when driving). Crying and saying I hate her and our daughter because we couldn\u2019t agree on a crib. These are just a few examples.\n\nAnyways, I left some dishes soaking in the sink yesterday with the intention of doing them before I left. If I am being honest, I forgot to clean them. She texted me to tell me that I needed to clean the kitchen when I got home, since I left it in such a mess. I apologized and said that I would clean it when I got home in the afternoon.\n\nI got home from work that afternoon and immediately went to shower (if I smell at all from work, she gets nauseous and therefore irritable). By the time that I got out of the shower and changed Anna had gotten home and was cleaning the dishes that I said I would do. When I offered to do them, she said that it was okay and that she\u2019s used to it (this does not happen often). I said that was kind of an unfair thing to say and she raised her voice and said that I\u2019ve always been this inconsiderate and told me to fuck off.\n\nThis upset me probably more than it should have, but I had a bad day at work, and I just felt like she was being unfair. I yelled at her and said that I\u2019m tired of her always being mad at me, and if she wants to find someone better, I will gladly get out of her way. She immediately started crying and said that she didn\u2019t mean it that way, apologized.\n\nI left to go on a drive and cool down and when I got back, she was still crying, now significantly harder in the bathroom.

Because, in my experience, people who \"forget\" to do the dishes and leave them in the sink overnight tend to \"forget\" other things as well.\n\nAnd ultimately you threatened to leave her and make her a single mom. \n\nYour wife is pregnant, hormonal, and rapidly moving into the \"miserable\" phase of pregnancy where your whole body aches, you can't do anything you used to do, your joints ache and your hips feel like they're disconnecting from your body, you feel fat, unattractive, and awful. Your hormones are all over the place. You can't sleep at night. You pee every 10 mins. You get heartburn and reflux if you so much as think about food. You want to be done with this already but at the same time you're terrified of labor. All you can think of is everything that might go wrong.\n\nThis is the point in your marriage where you should be bending over backwards to make things easier on her - not \"forgetting\" to do the dishes or using all the hot water so she can't take a shower.\n\nSo yeah, YTA. Not just for what you did, but for being so completely obtuse about the whole situation.", "Gentle YTA- I would have gone with N A H - if you had just lost it and yelled at her to stop blowing up at you all the time but you essentially told her you were a step away from leaving her- when she is 7 months pregnant. Pregnancy can be awful for some people and as some people have noted she could be dealing with prenatal depression on top of you doing things (unintentionally yes) that would be hard for any pregnant woman- being an hour late and not being able to get in contact with you absolutely can panic someone pregnant. I\u2019ve never felt more vulnerable in my life than when pregnant. You\u2019re not AH for getting frustrated and upset with her but you are for not addressing the issue with her before you went nuclear. You don\u2019t go from zero to threatening to leave your pregnant wife. Not cool man", "From one man to another, soft YTA. I understand why you feel this way, but you could have expressed your frustration with your wife in a better way. You're N.T.A because pregnancy hormones aren't an excuse to belittle your partner at any given opportunity, but YTA for threatening to leave (serious or not) at a point in time when she's incredibly vulnerable and about to welcome a child into the world for the first time. Give it a couple more days, ask your wife to talk and calmly explain your feelings to her (it seems like you both realize where you may have been at fault already), and do your best to make the next 2ish months as stress free as possible for both of you, because the last thing you want is for your relationship to be unstable AND have a newborn to take care of while the two of you aren't on good terms with each other. Show her that you're in this with her (if you really are) and continue to be supportive for her through actions, not just words. Best of luck to the both of you through the rest of this pregnancy.\n\nr/antinatalism would have a field day with this\n\nEdit: Holy fuck I'm not even top comment, but this is the most karma I've gotten in 8+ years on Reddit by far", "Yta you don't like that she implied she is used to your thoughtless-ness while providing three examples of you being thoughtless.\n\nYou aren't doing anything to *purposfully* upset her, but you are, by your own admission, pretty darn thoughtless.", "YTA even only for threatening to leave. In relationships that\u2019s one of the \u201chorsemen of the apocalypse\u201d as it were. If you\u2019re threatening to leave/separate, you\u2019re putting that possibility on the table. If you mean it, then you need to make that decision fast. If you don\u2019t mean it, then you\u2019re either being manipulative or you have very poor communication skills. \n\nPregnancy sucks and she\u2019s doing a lot of the heavy lifting right now. I\u2019m not giving her a pass here because the behavior is clearly draining for you. But when the baby arrives it\u2019s only going to get harder for both of you. She\u2019s going to feel worse for two more months, and then you\u2019re both going to be unbelievably sleep deprived. You both need to learn how to communicate and argue with each other effectively NOW or you\u2019re going to have some brutally nasty arguments at 4am when you both haven\u2019t sleep for three days and the baby is screaming uncontrollably. \n\nIf you get frustrated and threaten to walk out again, she\u2019s going to take you at your word sooner or later.\n\nIf you take a step back and can communicate that you acknowledge how hard pregnancy is and also that find her behavior towards you distressing, you might be able to work together to get through the pregnancy and newborn phase as a team.", "So you wrote out all that, every detail about being a shitty partner and not holding up your end of the deal, and you aren\u2019t sure if you\u2019re an asshole?

So Reddit, AITA?\u201d\n\nOf course YTA.

I figure you both have said things that shouldn\u2019t have been said.", "ESH. \n\nI\u2019ve been pregnant. The hormones definitely can wreak havoc. But that is no excuse to belittle your partner. \n\nYour examples in your OP did NOT all happen on the same day. They\u2019re individual things that happened during the pregnancy. So you\u2019ve been hearing quite a bit about how much you suck. At least in her opinion. \n\nBut threatening to leave and yelling are NOT cool. You lost your temper, and even with 4+ months of treatment that reaction is unhealthy and not very loving. \n\nI can understand why you lost it. I can somewhat understand her short temper because some women do struggle. \n\nShe NEEDS to speak with her OB at her next appointment about her emotional rollercoaster. She needs help. And you both need to apologize. Because adding an infant to the mix will be so not good right now.", "YTA. When she said she was 'used to it', you didn't have to get so defensive because, yes, you were quite inconsiderate at times.\n\n1) You used up all the hot water. 2) Went home late and was unresponsive (she is pregnant and might've felt vulnerable). 3) Left the kitchen in a mess for 1.5 days.\n\n1) and 3) alone makes you inconsiderate, even by roommate standards, let alone a spouse.", "OP, read this.

You gave three examples that can fit tidily into the article instead of dishes by the sink. \n\nYTA", "Imma have to disagree with some people here and say NTA. Was it a great thing to yell at her? No but she\u2019s been a huge AH to you for the past few months. I get pregnancy hormones are a thing (speaking as a woman I know how things can be for us) but it\u2019s not an excuse to treat you like that. I think you both need to sit down and talk things out peacefully. I hope all goes well with you OP. Tho the threatening to leave was an AH move at least you apologized. From what your saying it doesn\u2019t sound like she has", "You have been continuously dropping the ball: not cleaning after yourself, not leaving her enough water to shower, not communicating when running late (there is no reason not to answer a call while sitting in traffic).\n\nSo, your wife is heavily pregnant, and hormonal, and therefore irritable. But these irritations, which she was able to let slide before, are now getting to be too much - and she is reacting.\n\nInstead of feeling victimized, please consider upping your game. Because, if your slacking off is a problem now, imagine what will happen when the baby arrives!", "YTA you have been thoughtless, you fail to communicate, and you don\u2019t even know how to fight fair. DO NOT THREATEN THE RELATIONSHIP WHEN YOU GET CALLED ON YOUR SHIT. You owe her a huge apology that includes a commitment to counseling where you learn how to communicate and how to be organized.\n\nStart with getting a hands-free device and turning phone alerts back on when you are driving so you can answer when she needs to hear from you\u2014what if she went into labor and \u201coh oops\u201d you missed it?", "Without any of the rest of it, wildly YTA for the comment threatening to leave her. You never threaten to leave your partner EVER, for any reason other than you are actually leaving them - and then, it\u2019s not a threat. \n\nYour wife is almost as vulnerable as she is ever going to be, and you threatened to make her a single parent. She feels unlovable and emotional and in pain every day (and is not handling it well by the sound of it) and you just validated every insecurity she has and made her feel as if she is a heartbeat away from losing you. \n\nShe\u2019s not not talking to you because she\u2019s trying to punish you. She is incredibly hurt and possibly afraid to talk to you because she may not feel safe/secure in your relationship (not for her safety, I mean secure in the sense she won\u2019t lose you) so, my dude, you FUCKED UP fucked up. If you don\u2019t actually want to leave her or lose her you better walk that shit back right now and tell her you won\u2019t leave.", "I can\u2019t believe you\u2019d tell your heavily pregnant wife you\u2019d leave her.

I\u2019ve been a pregnant person with hormones. It absolutely can make you feel things more keenly, but given what\u2019s written here, I see no reason to assume (as many Y T A judgements are doing) that you do all these things and more, constantly. Everyone makes mistakes and is inconsiderate at times. It sounds like there\u2019s anxiety and maybe more going on for your wife, and hopefully you can help her find someone to talk to about things. But I\u2019ve been also been the emotional pounding bag for a depressed partner. Her anxiety deserves compassion and some understanding for a little bit of sharp edges, but doesn\u2019t excuse the frequency of sniping and belittling comments you\u2019re describing. I\u2019d advise to get help now in the form of therapy - for both of you. This can be a hard time, and the more help you get getting through it, the better. Left unaddressed, these habits of poor communication may very well intensify once the added stress of a newborn arrives.", "NTA for any of the things you did, except when you blew up you shouldn't have threatened her. That was way out of line.\n\nI'm also shocked at the response for acting like any of the things you did make you an asshole. They are the smallest of issues.", "NTA. I can\u2019t understand why pregnant people get a free pass to be terrible. I would have also snapped back. Even if she needs you to step up a little more she can use her big girl words and have a talk about it without being miserable.", "OP your wife needs some sort of help and her coping method doesnt seem very healthy for your mental health or her own", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

No.\n\nBut you threatened abandonment, knowing it would hurt. Knowing she\u2019d panic and beg because she\u2019s scared of going it alone with a baby that was planned.

Threatening to leave your pregnant wife is way over the line, and is something she\u2019ll probably never be able to forget.

Pregnancy hormones absolutely can make women act in ways they never have before, but there's not much that can be done about it til the baby is born.", "Exactly and their acting like he beat the crap out of her with their reactions. It\u2019s clear what the Dynamics of this sub work out to be.", "Little things add up in a relationship. And it\u2019s not usually about the \u201clittle\u201d things themselves but what they represent - a lack of consideration for your partner\u2019s comfort and wellbeing. It sounds like these three things that he admits to are evidence to his partner of a pattern of behavior.", "If he was in traffic, he could have texted her. It sounds like a personal philosophy.", "Hands free, cell phone mount on the dashboard.  I think most people have them.\n\nOP, just fucking buy one.  The next phone call you miss may be a real emergency.  She's close to that time.", "Okay if that makes you feel better go ahead. It is Telling that you go to that instead of the capital offenses of a long shower and being stuck in traffic.", "Right\u2026a lot of ppl on Reddit have no relationship experience to speak of and/or are teenagers. There are men out here violating their wives. Hot water and dishes? It\u2019s sickening at this point.", "Depends where you live, lots of no signal areas where I live. And my google assistant is locked until I physically unlock my phone, which I can't do while driving. Granted my new car has hands free calls/text, but my 2014 car I had prior didn't.", "I drive through a lot of rural areas and live in one, and do lose service *regularly* in one particular area, despite having a massive, nationwide carrier. \n\nIt\u2019s entirely possible.", "Some additional news: not all of us have cars with that capability. My 2012 doesn\u2019t, even with my BT adapter. I\u2019d rather he be late from traffic and make it home than call while driving and not come home.", "Isn\u2019t that the point? That he doesn\u2019t deserve to get crapped on every day for 3 separate occasions?  So what they live apart till the baby gets there or they work on a solution that lets them discuss things out like adults (which is what I proposed)", "Hormones aren\u2019t a free pass to be mean or yell at your partner, though. You\u2019re still in control of, and responsible for, your words and actions.", "Hormones aren\u2019t a free pass to be mean or yell at your partner, though. You\u2019re still in control of, and responsible for, your words and actions.", "Except texting and driving are illegal in most places for a reason. It's possible to be stuck behind an accident and having traffic moving, just slowly and no way to pull over.", "apple has a dnd while driving mode", "He said he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get them\u201d not \u201ccan\u2019t answer\u201d which leads me to believe he literally cannot.", "I lose cell service driving to my house from town, and people less than five km from me have zero cell service at their house. My 2014 car had no hands free driving abilities, and my phone does the thing where if i am in a moving vehicle i have to push \u2018i\u2019m not driving\u2019 for it to unlock. \nMy husband is always driving it is literally his job and is rarely in cell service, he knows the spots that get it and calls to tell me a rough idea of when he will be home, but that a plus or minus three hours rough idea because stuff happens", "But he's not getting crapped on every day. He's getting called out for his mess ups - which he admits to doing. Don't be thoughtless in your behavior and you won't get called out.", "That\u2019s when you do voice to text.", "You just click \u201cI\u2019m not driving\u201d And that stops.", "What about texting before you get in the car because you know you\u2019ll be home late\u2026..", "How would he have known about an accident on his way home before he left?", "I read it as he\u2019s an hour late coming home and also there was a wreck stopping him from picking up her call", "From my understanding of it, he was late due to the wreck and he doesn\u2019t receive any calls or messages when he drives at all so he couldn\u2019t let her know about the delay"]}
