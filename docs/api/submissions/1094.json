She said she would do it if I paid her.  So I hired a service instead.  Yes I could have paid her but it would have required me to go pick up her unemployed ass from my parents'house and let her stay at my house eating my food and drinking my booze.  The service came in fed and walked my dogs. \n\nWhen I moved out of our parent's home my friends all helped me out.  But not her, she was busy doing school work. But that she would take a break if I paid for her time.  She was watching TV. When she moved in with her boyfriend, now husband, I helped her out. She never even bought pizza and beer. \n\nShe is an amateur photographer but pretty great to be honest.  When I got married it was a small thing in my parent's back yard. To save money I did everything with friends and family. My aunt lent me her wedding dress and one of my friends made the cake. Everyone pitched in to decorate and set up and clean up.  I asked if she could take the wedding pictures. She said only if I paid. So I got a bunch of disposable cameras and used those for the candid shots and paid a photographer for the ceremony and formals only. \n\nI now make enough money that I can afford to make my life easier by just paying for whatever I need.  And this is what I do now for most stuff.  I still do favors for friends and they often return them. \n\nMy sister who wanted to get paid to sit in my house and watch tv so my dogs were okay ended up with a nice guy and getting married.  She called me last week and asked if I could watch her kids so they could go on vacation. Her husband's parents got sick and ours moved to Florida.  So I said I would if she paid me.  She can afford it. But now it's all about how family helps each other out.  I reminded her of all the times I asked her for help and she said I was being petty and vindictive. \n\nShe tried getting my parents on her side but they told her that she had set the ground rules for our relationship.  \n\nNow she is on social media trying to get her friends to make me feel guilty about not \"helping family\". I probably should not have responded but I did saying that her friends were also available to help her out for free.  But I guess she burned a few bridges there too and some of them called her out for always wanting to be paid for a favor.  \n\nIt's become a huge mess.\n\n#EDIT\n\nSo yes I did ask my sister to take pictures for free at my wedding.  The entire out of pocket cost for my wedding came to about $4,000. That includes the $1,500 I paid the photographer for 2.5 hours of their time and the proofs.  My sister wanted $2,000. \n\nAlso my husband did all the wiring in my sister's family room for free.  That was two days of a professional electrician working for free.  So not to be transactional about it but yeah. Once again no beer or pizza.

Years of this behavior and learning from it, and eventually realizing that she's not going to change, that's natural consequences and reasonable consequences, not pettiness or revenge. \n\nI'd say it more likely that she's projecting.

I never said sister was not a major AH and I get OP just being done with her. I would be too and far sooner than OP. But while I'm not a photographer I've actually had a LOT of friends who were. I used to work at an art school for years with a large fashion and a photography program and the pressure some of these students friends and family put on them for favors and free services could be just sickening.
