She is Russian and has gone no contact with her family since around the time we got married since they are alcoholics. She came here as a student. We have a 5 year old daughter.\n\nOur arrangement was that I gave her an allowance for buying anything she wanted for herself and then I paid for other expenses that we both agree on. I make more than enough for all of us.\n\nIt has always been a point of contention and she wanted me to increase her allowance. Sometimes when we disagree on a purchase like a toy for our daughter, she will use her allowance to get it then expect me to reimburse her allowance for it. Additionally she wants to buy expensive makeup and use it even for just going out to see friends casually.\n\nRecently since our daughter started school, she has started doing a few gig jobs like dog walking. I was not for it but I can't stop her from doing what she wants. However the time she spends doing that, means that she has less time to be a SAHM, so I told her recently that I expect her to pay for the house expenses proportionally to what she earns. She disagreed and I said I could just reduce her allowance in that case as she now earns. She got quite angry with me and we fought, things seem better now but sometimes I feel she is still a little upset. She used some minor things against me like the few times I asked her for money as I did not have change for small purchases.\n\nWas I the AH here? I think it is only fair to change the arrangement now that she works.\n\nEDIT: I get it I am an AH. I know I have controlling restrictions on her. We rushed into marriage for her visa issues as she could not find a job and hence married me. I always intended to lessen them once I trusted her and I realize I really do. My dad insisted I be careful because of what people say about Russian brides. She has an Ivy degree in physics and I know her dream is to be in science, I will talk to her if she still wants to get a masters or try getting jobs again now that she has permanent residence.
