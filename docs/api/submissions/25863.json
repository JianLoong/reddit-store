It is easier now that she is a teenager and we have already been twice, but even so it is a special thing and I am sad to miss out. \n\nHeck even if the motive  is not about about being with her kid, but for her own selfish reasons, I still think it might be kind of valid.

A lot of people are simply not comfortable with other people taking their kids overnight or on trips. There's only like one relative I would trust my son to (my sister), period. No one else. My in laws mean well, but Grandma gets distracted way too easily. As nice as you may be, they may have their reasons. Maybe it's just the mom's anxiety, but it's still their choice about who takes their daughter on trips. Undermining their decisions as parents is very much a YTA move.

I worked last Friday, will be working next Friday, and all the other Fridays I'm not here (not really, I get a lot of vacation time, so I take other vacations, but I'm making a point with them). \n\nAnd I still make them do chores! After we went to an MLB game (a Noon game, so we got home around 5 PM after going to the city it was in), we walked in the house and I said \"you (one nibbling) unload the dishwasher, you (other nibbling) load the stuff in the sink into it, and you (bonus nibbling, SIL's niece, and the oldest) find a pot and put water on to boil for me to make the pasta dinner we have planned. I am going to finish unloading the car (we had also done a grocery run), and I expect that all done when I finish!\" They had it all done when I dragged the grocery bags into the kitchen, and asked if there was anything else they could do (\"set up the counter for you to get your dinner once I'm done cooking, and then you're free to go play for about 45 minutes while I cook.\" They pulled out plates and silverware in just a minute and ran off...fun all day and 15 minutes of chores is not asking much! (9 (almost 10), 11, 12...that's not asking much from those ages!)).", "Yep, it\u2019s kinda like how parents wanna see their kids first steps etc. the first time they go to Disney, they wanna be there to see it. Pretty normal for parents to want to see their kids first. Now if they\u2019d already been to Disney and they still want to deny them, then that\u2019s pretty ridiculous.", "Depending on the details, yes absolutely. Because to me there isn\u2019t a can\u2019t afford ever. Given my current situation, something truly catastrophic would have to happen to my family for that to be a reality. Now when she\u2019s older if a friend invites her to go on a trip, that would be different. But for a young child, yup I\u2019d have her wait.", "Bwahahaha. Are you seriously doubting yourself? You are totally NOT the asshole. Your SIL has some big brass balls.", "YTA. Super duper bigtime . You promised Ava.", "Have you read some other Y T A comments? I am def AH to them \ud83d\ude02", "I didn't even talk to Ava about this idea, let alone promise.", "If they went together, OP would probably take care of the kid anyways while SIL enjoys the rides", "NTA\n\n\u201cYou can let Ava know I would take her in a heartbeat, I just can\u2019t also pay to take SIL. I\u2019m not in the habit of paying for other adults holidays.\u201d", "Wtf. Your SIL is the AH. Refusing to let her daughter go if you won't let her freeload? The entitlement of it all.", "I suspect they were trying to take credit for the trip but tell the niece to \u201cthank aunt op too\u201d", "No, they probably aren't lying about her being upset.\n\nThey're just the ones that told her.", "Personally I was thinking initially that the mother was just jealous that her daughter wants to hang out with her aunt... but after the \"just pay for me\" thing I think you're right. NTA", "Yep. She felt entitled to the trip. Good call, OP.", "Or taking the credit for taking her kid to Disney", "I think it\u2019s understandable that a mother would want the joy of seeing their child\u2019s reaction to their first trip to Disneyland - NAH", "This. The SIL is using her daughter as a negotiating tactic to get a free trip. Horrible parenting!", "You said everything I was thinking, wish I had an award for you. \n \nI completely agree. NTA in the slightest.", "Seriously wtf is wrong with people\u2026", "Soo mooching a free trip off of said cool aunt makes them less threatened how?", "Yeah if it actually the reason, one can understand why she might act like that. \nHowever if she actually thinks like that, she would benefit from counseling. That way of thinking makes no sense.", "She honestly just sounds like a choosing beggar out for a free holiday. Most parents would be so pleased and grateful than an auntie is giving their child such an opportunity instead of selfishly trying to wrangle free money for themselves.", "I Haz, Tu hasz, she hats, we hash, them hashers, us hsszz", "However, it\u2019s honestly pretty understandable to me that Mom expects to go and assumes you\u2019ll pay.\n\nSeriously? What kind of entitled person are you? I appreciate not wanting to let you child travel without you. But asking someone to also pay for you because thats your rule? No! Just no! You are not entitled to a free vacation. You tell them thank you, but I'm not comfortable having my child travel without me. When we're ready to take a Disney vacation we'll let you know and you're free to join us then. Not \"I'm coming too and oh, btw, you're paying for me.\" Wow! Just wow!", ">Like no dude, this is real life and that's how people end up in jail with a kidnapping charge.\n\nHe never said to lie and actually take her. He just wanted to test if SIL would join on a camping trip.\n\nPeople in this sub are so stupid sometimes...", "Good thing SIL is not great manipulator. Looking at OPs posts they would probably pay for a bit more that they initially offered for SIL to go if she just asked and showed even a bit of good will instead of just demanding OP pay for her or no one goes.", "Again, I\u2019d be taking her at a later time. If someone had offered to take her last year, I would\u2019ve said no because we have our own trip coming up. The only people my daughter spends the night with besides us are my parents and my ex\u2019s parents. If they wanted to take her somewhere, they would make it a family thing as they have done in the past."]}
