They should have been thanking you profusely for such a generous gift to Ava.", "NTA at all.\n\nSIL is the a h.\n\nShe denied her 9 year old kid a free all expenses paid trip to Disney land because she is selfish.\n\nWow that poor kid", "NTA", "\u201cInstead, we\u2019re going tent camping for three nights at the state park that\u2019s 30 minutes away.

And yeah, totally AH move to expect you to pay, especially for the \"reasons\" given.  If you want to push back, be clear with your brother that you may be willing to still take Ava, but it would be just you two and not SIL.  I bet he'd be on-board but she won't, like the entitled, selfish AH she seems to be.", "Your life choices are not her free ride.\n\nTell her to be a better mother and find away to earn money to afford taking her child do Disney.", "NTA \n\nYou never told Ava much less promised her.  If she is upset it\u2019s because someone else told her.  In which case I\u2019d make sure Ava knows that her mom is the reason she doesn\u2019t get to go on a trip with you.", "NTA you didn\u2019t promise your niece anything. If they chose to tell her your plans before things were settled, that\u2019s on them!", "NTA.. SIL wants a free vacation.  I want to be 5'9\" but that isn't going to happen either. I don't blame you for canceling.  Plan something local with Ava.  \n\nOH, and be careful around Ava. I wouldn't be at all surprised if SIL tells her you were going to take her on a trip and then cancelled.", "Nta She sounds manipulative to me. If she wants to deny her own kid a trip to Disney because she can't get a free trip too, you have to wonder about where her priorities lie.", "Tough situation.  Both brother and SIL are blackmailing you into paying for moms portion of the vacation.  It\u2019s fair that mom pays for half of room costs and her own airfare.  You offered to take Ava, so you pay for half the room and yours and Ava\u2019s airfare.  \n\nIf they told Ava about the trip after knowing it was off, it was to make her resent you for cancelling, and that more than anything makes them both AHs.\n\nUnfortunately, they will probably \u201cpunish\u201d you by denying you time with Ava.  But wait them out.  Obviously they trust you or they wouldn\u2019t let you spend so much unsupervised time with her. \n\nBefore you know it Ava will be visiting again because it means they don\u2019t have to pay a babysitter.", "Nta go anyway", "Absolutely NTA\n\nYou are offering their child an opportunity to do something special that they can\u2019t afford to do with her. Instead of being grateful your SIL is being a greedy, entitled AH.", "NTA. It's clear-cut. No explanation required.", "NTA", "Absolutely not. Both parents needs to come to reality. SIL is using you for personal gain. SMH.  NTA. Obviously they told her.", "NTA. I hate this whole idea that people who are child-free somehow owe something to those who have children, or that because they are child-free that they have unlimited money. \n\nYou are in no way required to give your SIL a free vacation just because she has a child and you don\u2019t. She made the decision to have a child - that is her burden, not yours.", "NTA. SIL thinking she's entitled to your money is ridiculous as well as telling your niece about the trip before it's finalized it insensitive on their part. It feels more like they just told her about the trip to guilt trip you into paying for your SIL to go as well. I'm surprised she doesn't see the trip more as you're taking your niece with you and giving your SIL and brother a mini vacation for them to do something together on their own.", "If she's inviting herself on a trip she can pay for it.

Seems a bit OTT and could be a bit of an overstep. Definitely jealousy inducing at the very least. If I was the mom I'd want to take her myself and if I didn't have the money to, then I'd probably ask if there was any way to cover my coming too... There's a small chance the mum was embarrassed or a little bitter about being put in that position and responded poorly because of that.\n\nI also want to add, there's a chance the parents asked the kid how they'd feel about going to Disney with op and that kid said okay if with mom too ..\nNow they face having to back track, but at the end of the day this is the parents fault and problem and they are definitely the AH for trying to guilt you into paying for everyone.\n\nYou are totally in the right to pull out of the offer, do something else with the kid that's a little less pricey, the camping ideas I've seen on here sound good, it'll take the sting out for the kid -as they probably would be just as happy to spend a few days with you...", "Definitely NTA.

Um. No.", "Yup. Now brother and SiL are upset that OP has a spine and is refusing to be walked all over. At least they know they can\u2019t manipulate her in the future.", "She could also just feel threatened by OP. Cool aunt who makes more money wants to take daughter on a fancy vacation.

Here's how you can be included or we will figure out how to do it on our own at a later date?\n\nAt the end of the day it is SILs kid, and she does all of the hard work on the day to day.

It's not relevant, if OP has kids or not. It's not relevant, if OP has 'enough income' or not. Maybe, OP uses most of her income to save for buying a house or for future stuff. Somehow or other, OP made a reasonable offer which she can accept or decline. Or maybe 'Hmmm... is there any room where you can help me a bit, maybe we can split the cost?' just like normal people do to negotiate.\n\nOr suggest, like others already mentioned, to postpone the trip half a year or so, so she can save up the money.", "Major aholes.", "Having no kids of your own is why you were offering to take and pay for your niece, not a reason for you to pay for another entire adult.
