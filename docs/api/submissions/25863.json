I knew she would love it since we watch Disney movies together all the time. \n\nHe wanted me to ask SIL. Definitely. She said they will let Ava go if SIL can come along with. I asked her if it was because she didn't trust me. SIL said no, she just wanted to come with. \n\nI told SIL she can come along with as long as she pays her way. We can all share the room, so she will have to get tickets (airplane) and her own ticket. She said she didn't have money for it and since I don't have kids or family, and has enough income, I should pay for her to come too. \n\nI didn't like it. Technically I has the money. But I don't like the way she said it and I have my own financial plans. I told her I won't pay for her. She said she won't let Ava go. \n\nThough disappointed, I cancelled the idea. My brother called me next day asking why I cancelled the trip, and Ava was looking forward to it. (I didn't tell her about the trip)\n\nI told him my conversation with SIL. He was upset with SIL but didn't have money to pay for her. \n\nHe asked if I would cover. I said no just on the principle. I felt SIL was forcing my hand and I didn't like it. \n\nNow my brother is calling me AH for refusing to cover SIL and cancelling a vacation I promised Ava.

She never had a Disney trip before or something? She's been missing this her whole life and saw an opportunity for a free ride? So entitled. It's too bad you couldn't get a trip with Ava this time but I hope you can spend more time with her in the future without SIL imposing and mooching.", "Tell SIL you've decided to take Ava camping for a few days instead and SIL can tag along for that for quality time with Ava.  Bet you SIL's answer is going to be a big \"fuck no\", because she's only interested in free Disney.  NTA", "NTA. If SIL wants to disappoint her daughter by refusing to let her go.

Holding your own kid hostage for a free vacation ransom is a new kind of low, and your brother doubling down on that is doubly despicable.", "NTA.\n\nYou never told Ava.\n\nIf anyone told her, it was them.  Still trying to manipulate you into paying her way.\n\nJust offering to pay for Ava is more than you needed to do.  Then they tried to take a mile more.\n\nI would probably talk to Ava and see if she actually knew.  It\u2019s possible she doesn\u2019t and they are again trying to manipulate you.  If she does know, maybe say something like \u201cI would love to take you, but your Mom said she wouldn\u2019t let you come with our her and she said she had to save up some money before she could afford it first\u201d", "NTA. You need to make it VERY clear to your brother that you NEVER told Ava about the trip. If she was told, it was a manipulation tactic by SIL to try to get you to cave. Either that or SIL is lying about Ava knowing and now being disappointed.\n\nYou don't owe SIL a free vacation. I can't imagine the amount of spite it takes to not allow your child to go on a vacation with a trusted adult because YOU can't afford that vacation.

Then trying to force your hand by telling your niece is really underhanded.", "Nta\n\nThey want to guilt/ scam you into paying for sil, and they are weaponizing Ava against you. \n\nIt sounds like they already told Ava about what was supposed to be a surprise, so let her know the whole story. Tell her you were gonna surprise her with a trip, but sil won't let her go unless you pay for her to, which was out of the question, so sil and your brother said that she couldn't go. Make sure she knows who the bad guys are.", "NTA, you want to take your niece, your SIL is an adult and should pay her own way. Why would they just put it on you because you have a good income? Thats insane.", "It's a trip for your niece. Assuming they trust you, there's no need for mom to come along.

NTA\nWhat great mom SIL is, that choose to forbit her own daughter of this amazing oportunity, just because she cant go! \n\nIm sorry for you and your niece, but you were absolutly right! SIL (and you brother) was very entitled and, again, was very bad mother. \n\nAva is now disapointed (SIL must had told her to manipulate you), but make her know it was not your fault and soon she is 18y you two will make a trip to compensate.\n\nNTA. you are not an ATM. The fact you are not married or dont have kids, doesnt mean your brother and SIL are entitled to your money. They should be happy you can provide things they cant!\n\nEdit: correct some gramar", "Your SIL had some nerve to assume you would pay for her and then wouldn't let her daughter go when you wouldn't pay for her.

It doesn't sound like her parents think about her enough to do right by her in the short run, I doubt that they will for the long run.", "NTA.   \n\n**You** didn't promise this to your niece.

They could have said she can go, and SIL can't afford it, but that's okay, we will save up for another time.\n\n**It was very wrong of them to assume, and then to demand, that you pay for SIL's expenses.**  That's greedy, and it's selfish, and it's making a decision that is only yours to make, not theirs. \n\n**They have no right to tell you how to spend your money.**  They have no right to demand you pay for their expenses because they want it.  Your financial decisions are entirely yours to make.  For them to demand you pay SIL's way is just wrong.", "NTA.\n\nIt sounds like your BIL and SIL were working together to try to get SIL a \"free trip to Disney.\"\n\nIt shouldn't be the case, but sometimes parents are jealous of their own kids' opportunities.\n\nAnyway: You did nothing wrong here.", "NTA you didn't tell Ava either your brother or SIL did. You offered to pay for your niece and pay for the hotel. The only things SIL has to cover are her plane ticket and tickets to Disney. That may be too much for her to be able to come and that's fair. What's not fair is to assume that you will pay for her or demand that you pay for her.", "Nta\n\nIt was her decision to have kids.

You had a thoughtful plan to take your niece Ava on a trip to Disney, which is a generous gesture. It was your brother and SIL who changed the conditions by insisting that SIL joins and requesting you to cover her expenses. You have your own financial plans and boundaries, which is completely reasonable. Cancelling the trip might be disappointing for Ava, but it was ultimately your brother and SIL's actions that led to this outcome.

You in no way are responsible for paying for your SIL. She's just a mooch and looking for a free ride.

Tell them you cannot afford to completely pay for two other people\u2019s vacation. \n\nHowever I also think it\u2019s weird that you invited your niece without initially extending an invite to her mom or at least putting your brother and SIL on the same text thread and asking through there. My brother and my husband\u2019s sister also have an amazing relationship with my kids but it would be weird if they wanted to take my kids on a vacation alone and not as a family. \n\nSeems like you and SIL might other issues you need to resolve.", "NTA. Wth?! You budgeted for one kid that you love, not to provide a vacation to another adult. They\u2019re ridiculous.", "She would deprive her child of opportunities out of selfishness and entitlement.
