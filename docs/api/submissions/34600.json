She always called me a \u201cweirdo freak\u201d and said I deserved the bullying I got at school because I was a such a dork. I stopped visiting Beth\u2019s house because of Jill and didn\u2019t see her again until Beth\u2019s 18th birthday, where she told people that I was harassing her boyfriend (I\u2019d literally said hello to him and that was it) because I was too ugly and weird to attract my own guy. Thankfully, she moved away not long after and I was just glad to be rid of her.\n\nNow: Beth and I arranged a dinner reservation with the other three in our group \u2013 Liz (33f), Kelly (34f) and Megan (34f). This was our first real chance to see each other in over two years, due to a number of reasons, and we were all looking forward for a chance to catch up.\n\nBeth offered to drove me and Kelly with her to the restaurant (since neither of us can drive and I have CFS and several types of chronic pain so travelling isn\u2019t easy for me). We caught a bus to Beth\u2019s flat together but it was Jill who answered the door which shocked us both. Beth hadn\u2019t told us Jill was visiting, and we\u2019d have appreciated a heads up since neither of us have good history with Jill.\n\nStill, we were polite. Kelly said hello and complimented Jill\u2019s dress, and I said \u201cHi Jill, nice to see you, how have you been?\u201d. Jill completely ignored Jelly and turned to me and said: \u201cbetter than you, clearly, still a pale freak, aren\u2019t you?\u201d. I couldn\u2019t help it and snapped at her that \u201cat least I\u2019m not a bitter hag still clinging to grudges I started with a 12 year old. Maybe it\u2019s time you grew up a bit.\u201d\n\nJill immediately ran off screaming for Beth and said she\u2019s \u201cnot taking us anywhere until that c\\*\\*t apologises\u201d which confused me and Kelly because why would she be taking us anywhere? That was when Beth came out and revealed her car was broken so Jill was meant to be driving us and I shouldn't have been cruel to her sister and \u201cthat\u2019s just Jill\u2019s humour\u201d. Kelly called bullshit and said Jill is a bully and she only surprised I hadn\u2019t snapped years ago and told me I\u2019d better not apologise. I said I had no intention to. Beth said \u201cwell, you can make your own way to the restaurant then\u201d and kicked us out.\n\nKelly and I called Liz and Megan to update them and say we\u2019d be running late since we now had to pay for a cab and they are split. Liz thought I should just apologise because Beth is siding with Jill and it would cut the tension, but Megan thought this was long overdue and Jill had it coming and Beth needs to accept her sister\u2019s actions have consequences. In the end, I refused to apologise and we got a taxi, only to find out Beth was refusing to join us over what I said to Jill. This was a week ago, and Beth is now refusing to speak to any of us other than Liz, who told her she\u2019s said I was at fault, until I apologise to her sister.

I used to think that it was some borderline sociopathic power play thing, but really it\u2019s just about not being walked on.

Straight up bully", "Beth may have not bullied you but did she ever stand up for you against her sister? Did she ever tell her sister to stop?", "You deserve better in a friend", "Good Jill is crazy. What she expected you to not answer her back\ud83d\ude44.", "It's very odd to me how Jill still acts the same as she did when we were at school.", "Good point. If sunk cost fallacy can apply to friendships, I think I've been using it. Time to give it up I guess.", "Even from the start. Imagine being 17 and having a beef with a 12 year old, it\u2019s disgustingly pathetic.", "Cut Liz off too, she's not helping!", "No she didn't. Beth and Jill's family acting like it was harmless fun and whenever I spoke to Beth and told her how Jill's behaviour (and her own lack of response to it) made me feel, she just said I was being oversensitive and I was a nerd anyway so what did I expect, especially as this was just Jill's humour. Made me feel like I was making a fuss over nothing, basically.", "Thank you. I think I need a chat with Kelly and Megan because I know for a fact when I refuse to back down, Liz and Beth will immediately try to sway them so more of the group is on their side. Honestly, that this is a pattern should really have been a red flag already. I'm feeling very dumb now for how blind I've been for so long.", "some people simply never grow up.", "If Beth never stood up for you and no one ever told Jill she was wrong/an AH and to shut-it, yeah, Jill had no reason to stop. I'm sorry but Megan and Kelly sound like real friends. Who needs enemies when you have Beth, Liz and Jill in your life.", "And I should have added - Beth isn\u2019t just an a-hole for not having your back\u2026It is also inexcusable that she ever allowed her sister to talk to like that, and baffling that she expected you to apologize. It always hurts to lose a friend, but you are truly better off without Beth in your life.", "What's so great about being her friend anyway? What value does she add to your life? Why has Jill been this awful for? So you have health issues and therefore deserve to be treated badly? NTA You need to cut off Beth and Liz as well. Liz is not your friend.", "Thanks, I am definitely leaning towards cutting Beth out of my life completely.", "Liz too, please. Stick with Kelly and Megan.", "Also, as this has continued for several years . . they expect you to continue to be a doormat and sometimes, the others in the group are shocked when you finally stand up for yourself . . .  The bully goes behind your back lying and whining about the whole situation . .  \"I only made a joke\" when it was outright mean bullying put out there in order for you to feel bad. Don't feel bad about yourself . .  feel good because you finally stood up for yourself and keep it that way. Apologizing will only be saying . .  I'm a doormat again . .  step all over me, hurt me . .  be cruel to me . .  because I don't matter to myself . . ..  Believe me; it happened to me. When I finally stood up for myself everyone was shocked and probably didn't know the whole story . . .  But I was tired of the whole thing and ready to move on. After that I was very careful not to pick friends or people to be in my life who are cruel narcissists . . .", "So she has never really been a friend to you.  I don\u2019t think you will be losing much if you cut her out.  I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through this.   Good luck.", "You're not dumb and it happens to a lot of us. It's honorable to trust people and be a good friend. The important part is to continue learning and growing. Now that you have learned their patterns, you can address behavior and move on as needed.", "I've been sat thinking about your questions for the last few minutes and I'm sad to say I cannot think of a single thing I have missed about Beth in the two years since we last saw each other. Our group? Sure, plenty, but Beth herself - no. As we've grown older we've clashed more and more - especially about my health- and I've bit my tongue a lot for the sake of our group, but I think I need to have a quiet word with Meg and Kelly to let them know I'll be cutting contact with Beth and Liz.", "Yes this is the plan now.", "You\u2019re NTA. Jill and Beth are though.", "Cut Beth, Jill and Liz out of your life permanently no question about it. If you want to be real petty posted what happened on social media and tell how long it\u2019s been going on do a video about it you will be surprised at how many people will rally around you with support. Who knows how many more people will come forth about Jill mistreatment or their own personal mistreatment from someone they know.", "Hard to believe this is going on with 30 year olds. Sounds like junior high.", "NTA. Please don't relent and apologise. Jill is a bully at that age and for what?? Jeez, some people never want to grow up.", "nta", "[removed]", "Ask Beth how she would react if Jill's was your sister and bullied Beth, and she said what you did to Jill, and you backed Jill up and said Beth was in the wrong for saying anything. See how she feels if it was the other way around.", "Sounds like you are better off without Beth. Your actions were justified", "Absolutely NTA. Don't apologise, cut them off if you need to and concentrate on the friends that didn't side with the gobshite bully", "I once bought something from a friend\u2019s sister (at an mlm \u201cparty\u201d).  The item arrived broken so, as she had said we should do if anything was wrong, I contacted her, asking how to go about exchanging it; should I do so through her or the company?  No reply.  For the next month or so, I called four more times and still received no response.  My friend said I should keep trying but to understand her sister was soooooo busy.  Uh huh.\n\nMy next message, left on the answering machine again, said I didn\u2019t understand why she would basically steal from me when I\u2019d done nothing other than help her business ( \ud83d\ude44 I know).  I let my \u201cfriend\u201d know that while I doubted my friendship with her sister would survive, I hoped we could remain friends.  Turns out her sister played only the last message for her.  None of the weekly ones for the past month.  Friend accused me of harassing her sister and leaving a message her kids could have heard.  Friendship over.  Okee dokee.  I contacted the company who said not to worry about returning the broken item and they\u2019d refund me immediately.  I was later told by a mutual friend that the company dropped her because it wasn\u2019t the first time this had happened.  I don\u2019t know if friend\u2019s sister was afraid a replacement would harm her percentage or numbers?  Friend & sister bitched about me for ruining her very lucrative business (and any down lines, I\u2019m guessing).\n\nMy point is\u2026sisters will stick together uber alles, especially if one is a bully.  The crappy one will push her sister to get rid of any friend who sticks up for themself.  You\u2019re *so* NTA.  I\u2019m sorry for the chronic pain your shiny spine must be causing but hey\u2026rock on with your bad self \ud83e\udd1f\ud83c\udffb", "Beth sounds like a terrible friend.  Let her go.  NTA", "NTA. Jill is just a horrible human being. I am surprised you continued to hang out with Beth all these years.", "Hell no. If I were you I would have already got that piece of dirt a little talk to years ago. Beth is also an asshole for siding with that little gremlin.", "You're not an asshole. She's not your friend if she allowed you to be bullied and made excuses for her sister. If my sister was rude to my friend I'd tell her to immediately to cut it out. I have two sisters. We've always respected and treated any of their friends like family. So no you should not apologize. Just find some new friends.", "Nope, it was long overdue. And this Beth sounds like a piece of work", "NTA. This bully behaviour is despiccable even for teenage kids. For adults in their 30s it\u2019s just beyond belief.", "Beth was never her friend and also was a lower key bully in a family that thought being a bully was funny. When you were hurt by her sister's comments, she called you an overly sensitive nerd. That's a bully pretending to be your friend so she could also hurt you.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

Beth was as much of a bully as her sister, just more subtly cruel than Jill. She probably had to learn that subtle cruelty to live with Jill, but turned it on you to feel better herself.", ">Beth and I have been friends since I was 12 and she was one of the few people in our year group who didn't bully me\n\nNot bullying you is a very low bar for friendship.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA, and I'd be cutting Beth off.", "OP will hear from Beth when Jill gets bored or frustrated and turns on her. Bullies always need someone to hurt.", "that's so embarrassing.... nearly 40 and acting like a child!", "Sounds like a bully.", "good for you!", "Do it. Your 30s is the time to cut out people that you've been friends with out of obligation. We all (hopefully) hit that point in our lives where we realize that we have to care more about our feelings than the feelings of others. If you haven't missed her in the past 2 years, you probably won't miss her in the next 2 either.\nGood luck!"]}
