She always called me a \u201cweirdo freak\u201d and said I deserved the bullying I got at school because I was a such a dork. I stopped visiting Beth\u2019s house because of Jill and didn\u2019t see her again until Beth\u2019s 18th birthday, where she told people that I was harassing her boyfriend (I\u2019d literally said hello to him and that was it) because I was too ugly and weird to attract my own guy. Thankfully, she moved away not long after and I was just glad to be rid of her. \r  \nWhich bring us to now: Beth and I arranged a dinner reservation with the other three in our group \u2013 Liz (33f), Kelly (34f) and Megan (34f). This was our first real chance to see each other in over two years, due to a number of reasons, and we were all looking forward for a chance to catch up. \r  \nBeth offered to drove me and Kelly with her to the restaurant (since neither of us can drive and I have CFS and several types of chronic pain so travelling isn\u2019t easy for me). We caught a bus to Beth\u2019s flat together but it was Jill who answered the door which shocked us both. Beth hadn\u2019t told us Jill was visiting, and we\u2019d have appreciated a heads up since neither of us have good history with Jill. \r  \nStill, we were polite. Kelly said hello and complimented Jill\u2019s dress, and I said \u201cHi Jill, nice to see you, how have you been?\u201d. Jill completely ignored Jelly and turned to me and said: \u201cbetter than you, clearly, still a pale freak, aren\u2019t you?\u201d. I couldn\u2019t help it and snapped at her that \u201cat least I\u2019m not a bitter hag still clinging to grudges I started with a 12 year old. Maybe it\u2019s time you grew up a bit.\u201d\r  \nJill immediately ran off screaming for Beth and said she\u2019s \u201cnot taking us anywhere until that c\\*\\*t apologises\u201d which confused me and Kelly because why would she be taking us anywhere? That was when Beth came out and revealed her car was broken so Jill was meant to be driving us and I should not have been cruel to her sister and \u201cthat\u2019s just Jill\u2019s humour\u201d. Kelly called bullshit and said Jill is a bully and she only surprised I hadn\u2019t snapped years ago and told me I\u2019d better not apologise. I said I had no intention to. Beth said \u201cwell, you can make your own way to the restaurant then\u201d and kicked us out. \r  \nKelly and I called Liz and Megan to update them and say we\u2019d be running late since we now had to pay our for a cab and they are split. Liz thought I should just apologise because Beth is siding with Jill and it would cut the tension, but Megan thought this was long overdue and Jill had it coming and Beth needs to accept her sister\u2019s actions have consequences. In the end, I refused to apologise and we got a taxi, only to find out Beth was now refusing to join us over what I said to Jill. This was a week ago, and Beth is now refusing to speak to any of us other than Liz, who told her she\u2019s said I was at fault, until I apologise to her sister.

She can give it but she can't take it. That sort you don't apologise to. And Beth is an A too. Gosh what a pair. 38 and running to 34 because another 34 was mean to her...

If this is how she treats her sister's friend, I hate to think how she treats strangers", "NTA, honestly I don't know why you are still friends with Beth. Its clear that she doesn't stick up for you to her sister. Also, what kind of person bullies someone four years younger than them? Someone that's insecure and is projecting their own issues.

Beth is not your friend anymore, and likely wasn't a good one in the past if she didn't defend you against Jill. Jill is a full on judgmental bully and deserves no apology or sympathy. Sadly, if Liz is siding with these two, she's not much of a friend either. \n\nDid your group get smaller? Yes. Will it suck for a bit? Yes. But you will be infinitely better off without any of them in your life.", "NTA.  She did have it coming.  After years of bullying you, you finally stood up to her & she didn't like that.  Beth can hold her breath for an apology bc you don't owe one to anybody.  Jill owes you multiple apologies, & now Beth owes you an apology as well.  Knowing the way her sister treats you, she still sided with her.  She has a lot of nerve asking you to apologize.", "Jill\u2019s an AH-but Beth is an AH and an enabler, which is much worse because she\u2019s backing up someone she knows is wrong.", "Thank you. Beth and I have been friends since I was 12 and she was one of the few people in our year group who didn't bully me. Since we Liz, Megan and Kelly are all friends, it's been easier to just put up with her so it didn't cause tension in the group but after all this I'm seriously considering cutting contact.", "Thank you, Liz and Beth's reactions were making me second guess myself. Tbh, I'm seriously considering cutting Beth off for this if she keeps acting like this is all on me when Jill has been acting like this since I was 12.", "Agreed, and then she backed up her sister-who was clearly in the wrong.\n\nI almost hate to say this but one thing I\u2019ve realized over the past few years is that the people who tell you not to apologize because it\u2019s a sign of weakness have a point. I used to think that it was some borderline sociopathic power play thing, but really it\u2019s just about not being walked on. In this case, OP did nothing wrong, so apologizing would just be admitting \u201cI\u2019m a doormat and you can walk all over me\u201d.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, if you did something that merits an apology you should apologize, but don\u2019t do it just to \u201ckeep the peace\u201d or some nonsense.", "Thank you, Liz and Beth's reactions to this whole thing had me feel I was going insane, and Kelly and I were both really confused about why Beth didn't warn us beforehand. She knows our history with Jill isn't pleasant. Tbh, I'm seriously considering cutting Beth off for this if she keeps reacting this way", "She\u2019s doing this because she knows she can get away with it-up until now. OP was, for whatever reason, an easy target. I highly doubt that Jill acts this way with co-workers or she\u2019d be out of a job. She picked on OP because she could get away with it. Now that OP stood up for herself and called Jill out, she can\u2019t handle it.", "Thank you, Liz and Beth's reactions had me feel I was going insane. Jill is like this with lots of people as far as I can tell, I don't understand why she thinks it's acceptable.", "Beth and I have been friends since I was 12 and she was one of the few people in our year group who didn't bully me. Since we Liz, Megan and Kelly are all friends, it's been easier to just put up with her so it didn't cause tension in the group (thought that's not to say the two of us haven't had some major arguments over the years).  You're right though, it's getting ridiculous now and I'm seriously considering cutting Beth off for this and just dealing with the fallout.", "Thank you for your comment. I said this in another reply, but Beth and I have been friends since I was 12 and she was one of the few people in our year group who didn't bully me.

Plus, she, I and Liz, Megan and Kelly are all friends, so despite our arguments over the years it's been easier to just put up with her so it didn't cause tension in the group. \n\nAfter this whole mess though, I'm seriously considering cutting Beth off and just dealing with the fallout even if it implodes our group.", "Thank you for your comment. \n\nBeth was one of the few people in our year group at school who didn't bully me, and with Jill, she always just said she was staying out of it because it was \"our issue, not hers\". Plus, she, I and Liz, Megan and Kelly are all friends, so despite our arguments over the years it's been easier to just put up with her so it didn't cause tension in the group.

I'm seriously considering cutting Beth off for this and after speaking with the others I am even more determined not to apologise for what I said.", "Thank you, Liz and Beth's reactions to this whole thing had me feel I was going insane. Liz tends to side with Beth no matter what and expects the rest of us to just \"keep the peace\" but I am sick of it and honestly tempted to cut them both off now.", "Thank you :)", "Thank you. I am seriously thinking I should just cut contact.", "They are bullying you now though. I can\u2019t believe someone over 12 years would say insults are like this. Sounds like a child. NTA", "I agree, you should absolutely cut her off. Beth is enabling Jill and it\u2019s not ok.", "Beth didn\u2019t have your back, and she is not a good friend. She is an AH, Jill is an AH, and you deserve better.", "OP Beth has been this way for 21 years and nothing has changed. What makes you think it\u2019ll change now?", "Thank you, Liz and Beth's insistence that I apologise to Jill was making me second guess myself. Tbh, I'm seriously considering cutting Beth off for this if she keeps acting like this is all on me. After speaking to Kelly and Megan, I stand by my actions and I will not be apologising as I really don't feel it's my place to.   \nI agree with you about apologising to \"keep the peace\", I always had to do that growing up and will not be doing it anymore.", "NTA and you *should* cut off Beth.  Allowing her sister to say these things shows us all that she is not your friend, and she may also say the same things to her sister behind your back.  They are off the chain trying to demand an apology for standing up for yourself.  You probably should have done that many years ago. \n\nI really have zero clue why a 38-year-old woman would even try to continue to bully someone like a middle school child.  She must actually be a miserable hag that absolutely needs to grow up.", "People like that are massive cowards. They only do it to people they don't think will fight back. Bet she does it to coworkers but behind their backs", "Firstly, I want to say I'm sorry for the bullying that you went through. As someone that also went through bullying around that age, it really sticks with you all those years later. I totally understand why you want to keep in touch with Beth, cause she offered you some safety, but its clear that while she wasn't the one that bullied you, that she was ok with you being bullied. Now that you are standing up for yourself, she's upset that the status quo is being disrupted. I think you are better off without her, you are stronger than you were when you were 12 and you still have Kelly and Megan. I would talk to Liz first to share your feelings and side before deciding what to do since she did back-up Beth", "I definitely would go NC with Beth and Liz. Keeping the peace is always aimed at the wronged party doing something to accept the \"abusive\" behavior so the \"abusers\" never have to be called out or feel a bad little feeling for being complete jerks. I do not keep those types of people in my life (abusers, condoners of abuse, and/or their flying monkeys). You deserve better, OP.", "Thank you.", "You should definetly cut her out. Jill is almost 40 and behaving like she's 10, and Beth just lets her sister behave like a child as if its cute. They are way too old to be behaving like it's high school.\n\nAs painful as it could be to cut someone off (I had to do it to a whole friend group and it made me feel awful), you gotta put yourself first sometimes", "Thank you for your comment. Writing this all out has made me realise I have been too forgiving of Beth over the years especially where Jill is concerned. I think I will be cutting ties with her for sure.", "Thank you for your kind words and your advice, I will speak to Liz first before deciding if I will keep speaking with her or not.. I'm sorry you also experienced bullying when you were younger, and I hope you're in a happier place now."]}
