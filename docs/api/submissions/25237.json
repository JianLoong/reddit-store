This was a big birthday (as you will find out when you turn 21) and you dropped your sister for a girl who may not even be in your life in the next year or so.", "Edit: based on the answer, YTA, OP. I understand having anxieties and overthinking when you really like someone, but you made a commitment to your sister, and you should be following through on it. If this girl's response is to decide you should just never hang out, then she's not a good match for you (or a good person).\n\nEdit again: name corrected\n\n\nInfo: if Brianna is so wonderful, why wouldn't she understand something like, \"I made a commitment to my sister so I have to go to her party this weekend, but I would love to go out another time. What about next weekend?\"", "Why can\u2019t you just let the girl know it\u2019s your sisters birthday and you want to go out another time or later?", "YTA. \n\nFirst and foremost. This has nothing to do with your sister being autistic. With or without that as a part of this story you would still be the AH. \n\nYou had a chance to go on a date which is great. But dates can be scheduled *around* events that you had already planned to attend. If Briana is a kind person, or even just a reasonable human being, she would understand that your sisters birthday party is a prior commitment you had made. Because you said yourself that you already told her you would be going. That makes your sister's birthday party a *commitment you had made*. You could possibly even have invited Briana to come with you and had a \"proper date\" after the party. Or scheduled for a later date. \n\nAnother point. Yeah there will be other parties/events/birthdays with your sister but there will never be another *21st birthday*. 16 and 21 tend to be important milestone dates for people and you actively chose to ditch the party for a date with a girl who may or may not opt for more dates in the future. \n\nAlso you're 16. Sure there is a super slim chance you could be with this girl forever and ever. But that is *highly unlikely*. So you ditched your sister's 21st for a date that might not even be a blip in your memory when you're in your 30s...but your sister will always remember where you prioritized her for such a milestone birthday in her life.", "YTA. This has nothing to do with your sister being autistic. This is about dropping her so you can go on your date.", "YTA\n\nIt\u2019s your sister\u2019s 21st birthday. Her being autistic doesn\u2019t change the fact that you missed a big birthday instead of simply telling Brianna it\u2019s Fiona\u2019s birthday, but you\u2019d love to go on the date another day.", "YTA.\n\nHave some self-respect, big dog. If a girl asks you out and can't/won't change the date if there's a conflict, then she's not really that into you anyway. Don't be so desperate.\n\nYou're also the asshole for telling us twice that your sister is autistic, as if we're supposed to make the connection that that means she's unreasonable.", "One, if this girl is the kind who would never want to date you again if you said \"I'm really sorry, I have a family thing today, but I would love to take you out tomorrow (or another convenient date for you both)\" then she's definitely not the kind of girl you should be upsetting your family over.\n\nYTA\n\nYour sister's autism is irrelevant here, she's your sister and it was her birthday and it was important for you to be there irrespective of your dad's permission.", "YTA, you planned to go, and made changes not to go after and you expected your sister and mom to understand?", "YTA  Take your date to the party. You may have plenty of days with your sister but how many of them will be for 21st birthday. Only one. Bet you celebrated your 16th birthday, why? Because you only get one your whole life.", "YTA and it seems like you know it.", "Hey I\u2019m an autistic person who recently turned 21 ! So i have an idea of what that\u2019s like.\n\nKid, YTA. I\u2019m not going to sugarcoat it cos hard truths sometimes help.\n\nTurning 21 (I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re American) is a massive deal in your country (and also generally) its like the last step into proper adulthood. Of course she\u2019s being dramatic!! its a big deal and her little brother doesn\u2019t care. He\u2019s decided speaking to a girl matters more than huge milestone! OBVIOUSLY she\u2019s upset. \n\nIf anything you\u2019re the one being dramatic about having to reschedule a date!\n\nHer autism wasn\u2019t relevant to this- I think you know that and trying to use it against your sister when she\u2019s hurt? Dick move.\n\nYou\u2019re 16, time you learn some empathy.", "YTA, why not ask Brianna to move it to an earlier/later date and explain how your sister's birthday is coming up. And what does Fiona being autistic have to do with anything?", "YTA you could have just gone out with that girl on any other day.", "YTA.\n\n21 is a milestone birthday.\n\nThat said, you HAVE to have the date THAT day AND at that time ?\n\nLike it can't be another time on the same day or a different day ?\n\nOr you can't just bring her to the bday party itself ?", "So, 365 days in the year, and the only day was your sisters 21 birthday, you could not have the date another day? You are already wiped are barely know the girl, I understand you are 16 and lead by your little brain but you are an AH.", "YTA- you missed your sisters milestone for some random girl you probably won't even like in 2 months. And your sisters autism has nothing to do with this, but good job trying to use her mental disorder to vilanize her. A+ sibling right there /s", "Part of being mature is sticking to your plans.  And any good partner will be understanding when you have prior commitments.  Actually, they\u2019ll respect and like you more for not being too eager with them.  Keep your plans, keep your cool, and consider your priorities.", "Dude, YTA. Skipping a commitment you previously committed to for another commitment is a dick move unless there is a valid reason. Going on a date is not one of them.", "YTA. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf she's so wonderful, she would understand you going to the party.", "In most cases, you'll have a relationship with your family all your life. You're 16 and you have a crush on someone that you might never see again in a couple years.\n\nIf you choose to go out with her instead of her birthday party you'll probably regret it later in life so YWBTA. You can always ask her if a different day works.", "I don't think it's an asshole situation, but is there a reason you think you couldn't have told Brianna you'd love to spend time, but can it be a different day because it's your sister's birthday party? I mean I don't understand the now or never aspect.", "YTA. Basically, you ditched a previous commitment to go do something more fun. That\u2019s shitty behaviour at the best of times, and the fact that your dad went along with it just means he was enabling the shittiness, not that it was an appropriate choice. The fact that it was a 21st birthday makes you even more selfish - those are big events for many people, and planned well in advance. Your sister\u2019s autism is actually somewhat irrelevant here - your behaviour was rude and unkind regardless of whether your sister is autistic or not.", "YTA. I'd like to think  Brianna is an understanding and empathetic person, surely she'd have no problem with you saying \"Can we go out together maybe next week sometime? I need to be at my sister's birthday party today\".\n\nFiona's autism has nothing to do with it, you made a crush more important than your own sister on her birthay...that hurts A LOT, OP, its not dramatics, you've made it clear that Fiona is not that important to you when a hot girl looks your way.", "Little warning; I\u2019m not sober and I\u2019m exhausted right now so this might be word salad a bit. \n\n\nLast year on my 21st my little brother refused to hang out with me or even wish me a happy birthday because he wanted to hang out with his girlfriend (who I adore and also did at the time) and sleep. Granted we have a smaller age gap, and I didn\u2019t exactly have a party, but I think I can relate to this situation. And honestly? I ended up crying myself to sleep that night. \n\nI\u2019m gonna tell you what I wanted to tell my brother. I know your older sibling probably \u201cisn\u2019t cool\u201d or whatever. But it\u2019s a once in a life time thing. (Edit: specifically 21st birthday is a huge milestone. I\u2019m sure everyone knows what I meant but I didn\u2019t like the way it sounded like I was saying it was her last ever birthday. \ud83d\udc80) She loves you, you\u2019re her baby brother. And as you both get older you guys have probably hung out less and less. This is an important birthday for her, but you\u2019re also important to her. You don\u2019t have to be connected at the hip, especially if she\u2019s gonna end up hanging with friends and family closer in her age and drinking. (Which can get pretty overwhelming.) One day you guys probably will only see each-other every month, or sometimes every other month, sometimes longer. You probably won\u2019t talk very much. You\u2019ll both be getting married and getting jobs and moving into your own places, etc. \n\nYou can schedule another date with this girl. But you both will never get this time with each-other back. \n\nMy advice? Reschedule with the girl. Apologize. Spend time with your sister, even if it\u2019s just a little bit. It\u2019ll mean the world to her.\n\nEdit 2: I\u2019ve realized I can\u2019t read I guess. So, it already happened and my advice is null.\n\nOkay, what\u2019s done is done. I think as far as YTA/NTA, I can see how you think. Because we were all 16 at one point. But at the same time, you must understand why it hurt her. I think for you to be NTA, you have to acknowledge that this isn\u2019t \u201cbecause she\u2019s autistic\u201d. (A disability or mental disorder making you have heightened emotions does not mean you\u2019re dramatic. You just feel things deeper than people.) The hurt comes from the fact you\u2019re close family and\u2026.honestly kiddo, she just probably really misses you. \n\nI\u2019m 22 now and my brother is 20, and I will forever find myself looking at photos of us as kids and wishing I treated him better, and wasn\u2019t so mean when he DID wanna hang out with me. I know that you\u2019re 16, and again your sister just \u201cisn\u2019t cool\u201d, definitely not as cool as a pretty girl being into you. And I\u2019m sure deep down she IS happy for you. (Assuming you came back with good news.) \n\nJust consider talking to her and making up if you can. If both of you are interested, maybe spend some time together?", "You're at the age when you need lots of date experience. You can go to plenty of birthday parties at other times.\n\nNTA. Your dad is smart. He probably remembers what being sixteen was like.\n\nYour sister thinks only of herself, and your mother is against anything that brings a young man independence and joy. Their opinions are worthless.", "Nta idk what your sister being autistic have to do with anything that what's I'm confused about. \nMaybe it me but what 21 year what their underage kid siblings at their party unless she doing a different", "Will go against the grain and say NTA. For 16 yo, when you crash asks you out, it is a pretty big deal.", "NTA, 21 is too old to be getting upset over a birthday.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou DESERVE to have a live of your own - Refuse to become your sisters caretaker and emotional support animal.", "NTA but definitely clueless about matters of the heart.\n\nIf it's meant to be, nothing will stop it. More importantly, if this girl is the kind of girl you really want, she wouldn't want you to miss an important event when y'all could get together another time. \n\nAnd if she never wants to talk to you again because of this? She's not the right girl for you.\n\nThe stars do not align and give you one perfect chance to meet with someone. \ud83d\ude42 Don't sacrifice the rest of your life for what you think is some kind of lottery ticket for love.", "Info Why are people saying 21 is a milestone birthday? Is this a cultural thing? It a perfectly normal year in my country,\u2026 \n\n\nAlso, no a 16 year old would not be badly missed at a party for a 21 year old. \n\nI think a lot of responses here just assume there is this big party going on, but for all we know it\u2019s just a get together for some family at the sisters home sitting around being bored, like most birthdays.", "NTA in the slightest.\nHow would you feel if your sis didn't show up to your birthday cos she went on a date with her long time crush?\nI'd be happy for her and would encourage her to go.\n\nCustody time for a 16 yr old though?

If I was the girl you arranged a date with and I found out you had bailed on your sisters birthday plans, deliberately not caring if you hurt her, I\u2019d think twice about dating you.", "YTA you already had plans and you ditched them because a girl asked you out. All that other information doesn't really matter. You could have just told the girl you'd love to go out but pick another date.", "100% the asshole without question and you know that you are the asshole. In a year or hell a few months this girl will mean nothing to you but your sister will still be your sister. A date can  happen any day but a 21 birthday will only happen once. YTA x infinity.", "YTA\n\nIt\u2019d be one thing if you tried to make it work, and then chose the date over the party when you realized doing both was not possible. To not even try to make it work is what makes you an asshole.", "YTA. You made a commitment to your sister. Girls will come and go, and now your sister will always remember that you ditched her on an important day for one you probably won\u2019t even think about in 3 years.", "You failed to answer the question", "Personally for me that is a major turn off, I\u2019d rather reschedule then have you ditch your sister on her birthday. She\u2019s only going to turn 21 once and for a lot of people their 21st birthday is huge, they are considered an adult.", "If she isn't understanding of previous commitments, especially with family she would be a terrible gf anyway and you'd have dodged a bullet.\n\nYTA.", "Only say thanks to the person that agrees with you lol", "True true", "LOL. The irony of you telling people to reread the post, when you clearly didn't read it well enough considering you're misgendering OP.", "You also risk her not agreeing to see you again when she finds out you ditched your sisters milestone birthday and you didn\u2019t even try to reschedule.  YTA", "[deleted]", "OP clearly says they're 16m, and yet you keep calling him she and her.... Projecting a little, are we??", "Also, I didn't even reply to you????", "Okay. Please show where in the OP it states or even vaguely implies what you are claiming.", "Oops. My bad. Early morning, ADHD...not so good.", "LOL All good. I was a little confused myself because rereading I was like; okay, we seem to be on the same side of this. Where's the disconnect happening?", "No, you're 100% right. Idk why this person identifies so strongly with OP but at this point it's a total self report irt their ableism.", "YTA \nYou offer no explanation as to why the date absolutely had to fall on that day and time.", "YTA. You made a commitment and you should have honored it, and told Brianna you'd love to go out with her but you already had a family event. If she was worth your time, she'd understand and work with you to find another date opportunity.   \nIt doesn't even matter what your plans were----you said you'd go, you go. You don't cancel for a better option.   \nSee this is a learning experience and grow your character.", "it\u2019s nothing you can\u2019t reconcile, but in a technical sense YTA. Should you go to your sister\u2019s birthday? Yes. Would it be a big deal if you didn\u2019t? Probably not. I personally don\u2019t care about mine or others peoples lap around the sun, but a lot of people hold it in higher regards. It\u2019s weird you keep telling us your sister is autistic and is irrelevant to the discussion.", "What the actual FUCK does her diagnosis have to do with anything? Also the terms \"high/low functioning\" are not accurate/useful. YTA.", "As a former hopeless romantic, I understand where you're coming from. You even had your dad's support, which makes you even more split. I think I would have probably told your crush to wait a day or so- that way you hit your sister's party but also don't look depserate to your crush.\n\nYou're kinda a jerk, but you're also young and had your dad's support so that really dampens the jerkiness", "YTA for trying to use your sister's autism to your favour. Not to mention it sounds like you're not mature enough to even date, going by comments you have made.\n\nSure you have many 'other times' to celebrate with Fiona but to bail on a milestone birthday for a date is just another reason why you're a YTA. Also even without autism, Fiona would've been upset not to share such a special day with family.", "YTA OP. If you're so quick to ditch your pre-planned event with a sibling, your crush should take that as a hint that you'd probably ditch her too if something more enticing came up.", "YTA grow a backbone and ask the girl out if you like her. If she likes you back, she\u2019ll understand why you want to go on a date at a different time. She did the hard work for you by initiating the conversation by asking you out.\n\nI do hope she finds out that you\u2019re ditching your sister\u2019s birthday and realizes what a horrible thing to do to your family. I hope she realizes that if you can easily ditch your family for your own self-serving pleasures, then you\u2019ll probably do the same to her when it\u2019s not convenient for you.", "YTA, you know you can just say 'hey, my sister's birthday is that day and she'd be sad that I skipped it, can we pick a different weekend?' and voila! you look like a super caring guy who loves his family, which most girls find very attractive. You fumbled the bag in making yourself look good, and you blew off your sister and made her feel bad too. Brianna might not be very impressed with that.", "YTA. you flaked on a commitment for a date. you WILL have other opportunities to date. you\u2019re 16. Brianna is not the last girl in the entire world, and even if y\u2019all started dating, it\u2019s a high school relationship. those typically don\u2019t last (even though they can be wonderful learning experiences to look back on at 30).\n\nif you had already declined attending your sister\u2019s function, it would be a different story. but right now you\u2019re just showing you\u2019re not even worth your word.", "So after reading your replies YTA. \n\nThere will be other girls you can \"watch\" (creepy by the way. Makes you sound like a stalker.) and go on dates with. Your sister's 21st bday only happens once. You just showed your family that you care more about the possibility of getting laid (we all know what's on a 16 year old boy's mind) then you do about family and honoring your commitments.", "YTA. Her autism has nothing to do with this, it's about your commitment. That's just plain ableist.", "Hot classmate 1, autistic sister 0.", "Having read your replies to this I really hope Brianna sees this, recognises you, and has no further dates with you OP.\n\n\nYou're missing your sisters major milestone without even trying to compromise of times with Brianna. That shows your immaturity.", "NTA, Sometimes, other plans come up on other plans, you do what you want to do.", "I think you may be the A-hole, she's your sister, I understand realy wanting to go on a date with this girl because you have/had a crush on her, but ask if you can change the date of the date to a day later, so you can go on the date and go to your sister birthday, if the girl says no, then dump her, family should always be first in my opinion.", "You can't go to another 21st birthday party though. You sound like a misogynist.", "Going to a milestone birthday party when you said you would is just being a normal decent person, not becoming someone's caretaker. This is gross as hell, autistic people are allowed to have human emotions and being upset someone ditched you is a normal response.", "So you make it a habit of dismissing her valid feelings because autism?", "Go to your sisters bday party! You don\u2019t bail on bday parties of people you care about for first dates. \n\nIf Brianna is worth it she\u2019ll understand, suggest another time later in the week or next weekend. If Brianna gets upset then you dodged a b.", "You should talk to your sister about your date and see if she understands.", "Sorry, but why? Per your story, *she* asked *you* out. You think she's not interested or is going to drop you in a second? Clearly she's interested, she approached you! I'm quite certain someone who is willing to ask you out will be understanding that you already have plans, but would love to go out with her on most any other day.", "Doesn\u2019t sound like your sister\u2019s the dramatic one in this sitch", "Well 21 is generally one of the last big blowouts you can have without people who are bummers about birthdays hassling you. But also, most adults can say, \"hey I have plans that weekend, let's do another.\"", "She is fine to be upset. THat is not the point.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOP is STILL fine to have other priorities.", "Oh so you really did mean to use your sister's autism as an excuse as to why you don't have to give a shit about her feelings. That's absolute AH behavior.", "I\u2019d be gone *so fast*.", "Yeah, this. Not the same situation, but I used to have a friend that would cancel the night before hanging out a lot for other people. It got to the point where we would have plans scheduled like a month or a few weeks out, and then she'd suddenly bail because her other friend who she hadn't seen in FOREVER was coming to town and we could do it next week, right??? She also used to come over to my house to hang out and then ask to go hang out with her other friends/boyfriend because we lived in the same town and she had moved a city over.\n\nIt makes the other person feel whoever you're ditching them for has top priority and you don't actually matter to them, regardless of how true it is. Especially with something like OPs situation.", "You can always revoke your RSVP. It happens all the time. I had people flaking out of my wedding the day before. Was i angry? Nope", "Way to nitpick and miss the point.", "I dunno what culture you grew up with, but this is basic politeness", "This is what's known as an irrational anxiety. She's already asked you on a date -- that means she's interested. She's interested enough to ask you out, she'll almost certainly be interested in you enough to reschedule.", "So you\u2019re ok with risking you\u2019re relationship with you\u2019re sister? What a shame.", "My culture? No clue Why that matters? Its my own beliefs superficial stuff like this isnt that important. If someone doesnt show up at my party Why would i be mad?", "And if she does want to keep seeing him, she\u2019s probably super toxic.", "Or you\u2019re just blind.", "It\u2019s your own beliefs, I adnt gonna change that, have it your way"]}
