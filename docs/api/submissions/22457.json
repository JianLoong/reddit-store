We had planned the trip for a while, since it was our time away from our 3 kids. After setting up camp we cooked some food and went to sleep, around 4:30 a.m I woke up to 3 missed calls from my mother. I didn\u2019t want to wake up my husband so I quietly answered. She told me that my son (4) had an allergic reaction to the food they had given him, and started to cough and turn purple. I started to panic, and didn\u2019t know what to do, because we were in the middle of the woods and our truck was a while away from the campsite. I shook my husband frantically and he just groaned and rolled around. I shook him more and he finally answered by saying \u201cWhat! I am so tired.\u201d I told him about the call, and he told me my mom would take care of it, and we should just enjoy our time away from everything. I told him that I would be leaving to the truck, because I was scared for my son. He mumbled something and went back to sleep. I then rushed out of the tent and ran to the truck. I texted him that I would be back in the morning, as long as our baby boy was okay. The next morning our son was fine, so I returned to the campsite, to find my husband sitting in a chair drinking a coffee, as soon as I came up to him he had a very angry face on. I asked him if he remembered and he didn\u2019t care. He told me he wanted to go home, we packed up and did. On the drive home he started to talk and told me he woke up scared because I wasn\u2019t sleeping beside him.

This is just common knowledge, once again though, apparently not to you.\n\n3. \"No guy was around to be logical\" literally the most dipshit, immature, ridiculous answer.
