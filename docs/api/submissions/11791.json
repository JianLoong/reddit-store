After many failed attempts, SIL was told that she wouldn't be able to conceive due to a medical condition she has, they finally got pregnant. \n\nSince having my niece, the baby has been the center of attention at EVERY family even we've had since she was born. Birthday's, wedding's, family get togethers, you name it. Now don't get me wrong I LOVE my niece, but it can get to be a little too much when my SIL goes on and on about how long they tried to conceive, complications they've had, miscarriages they've had etc. Like a little TOO much info. Many family members have commented on how it's a little bit excessive, but no one has said anything because they don't want to sound like an AH. \n\nAnyway I'm getting married in the spring and my brother and SIL approached me last weekend about having my niece be the flower girl.\n\nNow my fianc\u00e9 (35M) has two children (10M and 6F) from his previous marriage. His son is one of his groomsmen while his daughter had asked to be our flower girl when we told them the news that we were getting married a year ago, as it's something she always wanted to do, so of course we said yes. \n\nSo I explained this to my SIL when she asked me about my niece. She asked if my step daughter can just carry my niece with her? I said I don't think she'd be comfortable with that considering she's 6.\n\nShe then asked why I can't give that role to my niece, and allow herself to carry my niece down as the flower girl? I said no because I already promised my step  daughter.\n\nShe then starting going off about how my lack of effort to incorporate my niece is disgusting to her. I should \"honor her\" in some way since I know how long and hard they tried for my niece. \n\nNow I may sound like an AH for this but I kind of got fed up and snapped and said \n\n\"Incorporate my niece how? By the time the wedding comes around she'll be 2 years old. The ENTIRE family already knows your story about how long and hard you guys tried for her. What more do you expect me to do to honor her?\"\n\nShe started crying and said that clearly I don't love my one and only niece and I'm \"letting her down\". I said of course I love my niece, and obviously she's going to be involved in pictures and stuff. But I'm not going to let my step daughter down by giving my niece a role she's too young to remember anyway. \n\nWell now SIL and my brother are pissed off with me for not letting my niece be flower girl, and are running around telling the rest of the family I don't love my niece. My mom had been trying to stay neutral but thinks my step daughter would understand if I explained to her I need to give that role to my niece.\n\nI'm firm in my decision though, and my fianc\u00e9 is thankful that I didn't let his daughter down.

She's potentially harming her child by putting this kind of focus on her. \n\nBottom line is you did nothing wrong and your SIL is taking this too far.", "Honestly SIL will try to make her daughter the center of attention.

Your SIL needs to get some counseling while the child is still young enough, or she's going to ruin that little girl's life with her weirdness. Entitlement, expectations, the burden of being made to feel special just for having been born. That poor kid should get the chance to have a normal childhood.

Let her do this by herself without princess-niece or later in life we'll all be reading on \"dear reddit AITA for not wanting my step mom's niece at my....\"", "**NTA**\n\nAnd I think it's very concerning, and very telling about how spoilt your niece is likely to become, that your SIL didn't even TRY to frame this as just finding a way for your niece \"participate\" (which might have been understandable), but had the sheer gall to suggest to you that you and your partner, THE ACTUAL BRIDE AND GROOM, owed it to her \"miracle child\" to \"honour her\" at YOUR WEDDING. She actually suggested that this child deserved to be a (if not the) person of honour on your special day . . . several years after her birth.\n\nI mean, how many years does she intend to keep this up for? How many years does she intend to spend insisting that other people \"honour\" her child at THEIR occasions, in place of themselves and their own immediate family members?\n\nIt's not just that it's obnoxious, it's genuinely unhealthy for this poor kid. She's being put on a pedestal and taught that she is different from and above all not just other children but literally everyone else from her life. They're basically worshipping her. \n\nAnd it's not that I don't get it. Aside from siblings who struggled with infertility I have a very, very close friend whose infertility battle meant that he and his wife were married *nearly twenty years* before they were able to have a beautiful, healthy, bio child of their own. Can you imagine? Almost two decades. Theirs was a miracle in the truest sense. And yet, do you know what they DON'T do? Ask other people to worship their kid or place them at the centre of their own special occasions. In fact, they're thrilled to pieces just to hear that people love their kid and think they're doing a good job as parents. That's enough for them, the gift of being parents after all this time, and to see people love their sweet, well-mannered child. \n\nYou are NTA, but OMG your SIL is doing that kid a disservice. Your response is completely appropriate. Your wedding is not the place to \"honour\" someone else's 2-year-old. Not even a beloved rainbow-baby niece.", "NTA\n\nHold your ground.\n\nMy sympathies to the baby though. Imagine growing up your whole life being told you're a miracle and the centre of the universe.

Without knowing her story, or how she came to be part of your life. She's 6 years old, and you've made a commitment to be in her life. The moment you make it official revolves around her as much as it does you.\n\nYou absolutely have every right to honor the stepdaughter over the niece, and these first moments as stepmom are going to cause the ripple that forms the pond that is your relationship for her whole life.\n\nTrust me, if you back down now, and give her spot away, it's going to ruin more than just your wedding.\n\nETA thanks for all the upvotes!!

It is going to have to have so much therapy to get over what is going to be a traumatic childhood by this nut ball mother.", "NTA - Your niece won't know or remember the wedding at all.  So the only one your SIL is trying to benefit is herself.  And to suggest that you remove your husband's own daughter from the wedding so that your SIL can feel special is just narcissistic as hell.", "NTA. Your niece is special to her parents because she the path was long and difficult for them. But everyone else has their own special people for their own reasons. It sounds harsh but miscarriages and IVF are not good enough reasons to impose your own wishes on someone else's wedding. You might make exceptions for people who haven't much time left, perhaps. But as you said, your niece won't even remember the day. It's beyond ridiculous.\n\nThis is you and your fianc\u00e9's day and his daughter should naturally come first.

Sounds like a great foundation for a happy marriage! \n\nDon't let them grind you down.", "NTA, and continue to stand firm.\n\nYour brother/SIL are complete assholes here. They are out of line every step of the way. I'm sure their daughter is great and they think the world of her, it has NOTHING to do with your wedding. For them to even suggest your stepdaughter - a person who is part of your immediate family and who is profoundly involved in your whole marriage - is at all inferior to your niece is, to put it nicely, idiotic and offensive.\n\nYour mom is also a major asshole - she's not staying neutral at all, she's actually trying to justify your asshole brother/SIL's demands. That's awful.\n\nI would probably give them one more chance to drop this completely and accept your decisions about your wedding and show you basic respect. If they are unable or unwilling to do that, I would tell them in some very impolite words just how important they are to the wedding (which is to say, they are not important at all) and how their absence is going to be the only wedding gift you'll accept from them.", "NTA.

You could also have one of your bridesmaids (if you are having bridesmaids) carry her and hold her for the ceremony if you wanted to include her in the wedding party, but my honest opinion is that she is really too young. It would be different if she were your daughter or stepdaughter, or if neither you nor your fianc\u00e9 had children of your own, or if it were very important to you that she be in the wedding party, but it sounds like none of that is the case. \n\nYour SIL should back off and just enjoy the wedding and the opportunity to put her baby in a pretty dress and show her off to anyone who will listen during the reception.", "NTA.\n\nYour fianc\u00e9's daughter asked and was given the role by the two of you.

She is their miracle, and their whole world, but to everyone else the world does not revolve around her.", "NTA.  This is potentially a precursor to your stepchildren being muscled out by your niece, so please continue to stand your ground (it\u2019s bad enough that not only your SIL, but your mother also thinks it\u2019s OK to backtrack on your SD).  You completely have the right end of the stick by standing up for your stepdaughter as her mother, as well as the logistical reasons for why it makes more sense for her to be the flower girl. \n\nIf I were in your family and I heard your SIL\u2019s rants, I would probably think - ah, finally, somebody put their foot down to the self-centred parents.

Your sister is being selfish at the expense of a child who's father is one of the ones getting married. IMO, if the flower girl has to be carried down the aisle, she's too small to be a flower girl.
