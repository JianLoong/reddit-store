Attending university \"was\" the plan.  Then you became a dad.  The new plan is that you need to support your girlfriend and baby, and that means being close to them.  Either transfer to a college in your hometown, attend college remotely, or move her out to you.", "YTA\n\n*My girlfriend recently told me that she feels like she\u2019s doing all the work alone and it would\u2019ve been easier if I was closer*\n\nThat's because she IS doing all the work alone and it would be easier if you were closer. You keep going after your DREAM, no changes, no sacrifice. Your girlfriend had to put her life on hold, is sacrificing daily, and having this baby didn't affect you much. Your girlfriend didn't tell you to drop out, just she'd prefer if you were closer. That's not an unreasonable request for compromise. \n\nYour parents most likely would prefer not to have to pick up your slack, but they've left with not much choice either.", "Of course YTA\n\nThat was the plan *before* you got her pregnant and had a child with her.\n\nOnce that happened, plans changed.\n\nFind a place to go to school that is closer to your baby.", "YTA. \n\nIt doesn't matter that going to this university was the plan before your girlfriend got pregnant.

It's likely your girlfriend has given up FAR more than you to raise this child, and I'm assuming you made the decision to have the baby together.\n\nYou and your girlfriend are equally responsible for this child - and while it isn't fun to have to give up your plans, you have responsibilities now to your child and your girlfriend which, frankly, it sounds like you are really not fulfilling right now.", "YTA.\n\nYou had a bloody kid you muppet.

And also, taking care of a 5mo is exhausting, even if he\u2019s sleeping well. \n\nIf college and marriage is a long term plan for you, then I would recommend reminding everyone of the plan, and prioritizing your gf and child.

Maybe you should stay home with the baby so she can go to college 2 hours away.", "YTA\n\nDude.  You're a dad now.  That's what you are.

You aren't going to be able to live in the dorms, party, have the time of your life.  You have a kid.  That life is not  obtainable to you now.  \n\nThat said, just because you have a child, doesn't mean your life is over and you cannot enjoy it.  You are still a person who deserves to still be a person.  But so does your girlfriend.  You're taking that away from her.  If you continue down this path, fully expect her to leave you for someone else who is present.  Then expect visitation and child support.  Do better.", "I hesitate to come down on you, because you\u2019re a young, new parent, and your girlfriend did say it was okay. But YTA.

Obviously you can't read her mind, and I get it that them making you feel like an asshole is probably very stressful.\n\nBut.. there's also very little information in your post.

You don\u2019t need to even stay with your girlfriend, but you do need to step up for your kid, and that means actually being a parent\u2014not just dropping in a couple of hours most weekends.

I wouldn't be surprised if she left you, I would", "The answer to this depends on whether you actually needed to go there or not - you haven't said anything about this.

If the baby takes a nap during the day you're so exhausted from everything else it's either sleep or get everything else done that you have been neglecting. OP is an AH.

First, the assumption that he\u2019s off partying for four years.  The reality is that his getting a degree could be a game changer when he graduates in terms of providing for his child.

The second assumption is that he lives in an area where he has lots of  school opportunities nearby.   The absolute closest university to my hometown was 2 hours away.  The only thing close by was a vo-tech.   And he hasn\u2019t abandoned the child or mother, they live with the parents.

Maybe you have completely worthless family and my experience is somehow unrepresentative, but grandparents, aunts and uncles, cousins, and even close family friends are usually pretty willing to literally take a newborn to give the parent(s) days and nights off to help take care of a baby, and they are especially eager when you have a tough situation like one parent having to be away because of a job or school.
