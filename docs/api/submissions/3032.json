Attending university \"was\" the plan.  Then you became a dad.  The new plan is that you need to support your girlfriend and baby, and that means being close to them.  Either transfer to a college in your hometown, attend college remotely, or move her out to you.", "YTA\n\n*My girlfriend recently told me that she feels like she\u2019s doing all the work alone and it would\u2019ve been easier if I was closer*\n\nThat's because she IS doing all the work alone and it would be easier if you were closer. You keep going after your DREAM, no changes, no sacrifice. Your girlfriend had to put her life on hold, is sacrificing daily, and having this baby didn't affect you much. Your girlfriend didn't tell you to drop out, just she'd prefer if you were closer. That's not an unreasonable request for compromise. \n\nYour parents most likely would prefer not to have to pick up your slack, but they've left with not much choice either.", "Of course YTA\n\nThat was the plan *before* you got her pregnant and had a child with her.\n\nOnce that happened, plans changed.\n\nFind a place to go to school that is closer to your baby.", "YTA. \n\nIt doesn't matter that going to this university was the plan before your girlfriend got pregnant.

It's likely your girlfriend has given up FAR more than you to raise this child, and I'm assuming you made the decision to have the baby together.\n\nYou and your girlfriend are equally responsible for this child - and while it isn't fun to have to give up your plans, you have responsibilities now to your child and your girlfriend which, frankly, it sounds like you are really not fulfilling right now.", "YTA.\n\nYou had a bloody kid you muppet.

You aren't going to be able to live in the dorms, party, have the time of your life.  You have a kid.  That life is not  obtainable to you now.  \n\nThat said, just because you have a child, doesn't mean your life is over and you cannot enjoy it.  You are still a person who deserves to still be a person.  But so does your girlfriend.  You're taking that away from her.  If you continue down this path, fully expect her to leave you for someone else who is present.  Then expect visitation and child support.

Obviously you can't read her mind, and I get it that them making you feel like an asshole is probably very stressful.\n\nBut.. there's also very little information in your post.

You don\u2019t need to even stay with your girlfriend, but you do need to step up for your kid, and that means actually being a parent\u2014not just dropping in a couple of hours most weekends.

Not to mention, a newborn baby requires so much attention. So many sleepless nights, diapers, changing clothes, pumping bottles, more diapers, and the cycle just keeps repeating itself. If the baby takes a nap during the day you're so exhausted from everything else it's either sleep or get everything else done that you have been neglecting. OP is an AH. Even if his gf was trying to work to support herself, that cost of childcare for a newborn is more than what minimum wage pays out a month. If he wanted to keep his plan and his future path, he should have  been protecting that. Everything changes when a child is dependent on you.", "I mean, I find this one odd as well. First, the assumption that he\u2019s off partying for four years.  The reality is that his getting a degree could be a game changer when he graduates in terms of providing for his child.  He\u2019s certainly going to have a better chance to get a decent job at 22 with a degree than 4 years of a minimum wage job.  The second assumption is that he lives in an area where he has lots of  school opportunities nearby.   The absolute closest university to my hometown was 2 hours away.  The only thing close by was a vo-tech.   And he hasn\u2019t abandoned the child or mother, they live with the parents.  I mean, I understand that this isn\u2019t a great situation for anyone, the reality is that he\u2019s going to school and graduating with a useful degree is the absolute best thing for everyone in the long run.

It was probably far too late to transfer to another college and it made sense just to go to school, start his degree, and see how things went. \n\nThere\u2019s no guarantees that there is another school closer to the baby so this might be it for him.

NOT!", "Yeah, it's a bit lacking information. How often is he home? How much do the parents help? Have they discussed these plans after the baby came?

What has he given up in this situation? Nothing, that\u2019s what.  Meanwhile she\u2019s the one making all the sacrifices.  He\u2019s basically a deadbeat.", "He doesn\u2019t say anything about that not being a decision they made together. There\u2019s no reason to think she kept it when he didn\u2019t want to. What we do know is that he was an equal participant in getting her pregnant so he bears equal weight.", "That's only if he's willing to support them in the long run. But he could very well just tell her to fuck off once his dream is achieved.", "And that's you. OP's girlfriend is struggling now and is asking for help now. Maybe she can't make those 4 years of sacrifice. I always think it's extremely important to listen to immediate needs of people, especially young new mothers, instead of telling them to look years into the future.", "I don't disagree.  What I do disagree with is that he needs to commute 2 hours each way OR live on campus.  Unless it is a true top tier school that he's unlikely to be able to transfer to with an associates, he doesn't need to sacrifice as much now.  2 years to get an associates at a community college with a guaranteed admission to other local school?  Is there another school that is 'good' closer? \n\nIs he in a field like engineering where online isn't likely to be an option?\n\nThe point is, unless there is some specific need to be at that particular school, there are ways to move forward, likely more economically, that would free up more time for him to either work to support baby and baby mama or help with direct childcare.", "Frfr pregnancy and babies are a lot of work I'm tired of people taking that away like we're pregnant well good you can push it out of wait .... You can't", "\"BOTH got pregnant\" pretty sure everyone else knew what that meant.", "How do you think people get pregnant was she not also involved in getting pregnant??", "Well... Did SHE choose? When we've legally removed that choice from a very large number of women, we don't get to use \"she chose to keep that baby!\" as part of our default argument anymore. We don't know that she had any more choice than he did.", "Keeping the baby is NOT 100% the woman\u2019s choice. Do we know where they live? If OP is in the US, there is a good possibility that she had no choice.", "Nope but I think you\u2019re (probably) mature enough to take as many steps as possible to not get pregnant, and have a plan in mind in case of that happening. A 16/17 year old isn\u2019t as good at decision making as a 30 year old, hence them being teenage parents. He has a kid, too bad, college can wait but the baby can\u2019t.", "Abortion could have gotten her arrested in half of the states now", "Abortion is not available as an option for a lot of people anymore.", "People really act like abortion is some easy and quick thing where you\u2019re back to normal a couple hours later. It\u2019s not, it can last days, it mentally and physically takes a toll. Yes, so does pregnancy and being a parent obviously but abortion is NOT an easy choice.", "Abortion is not birth control. If he wanted his life to go exactly as planned he needed to not have sex or be extremely careful, have talks with his gf about the \u201cwhat ifs\u201d before having sex at the very least. He got her pregnant, they have a baby together, there\u2019s no going back and he needs to step up.", "But either way - OP needs to decide whether he's 100% in or 100% out. You can't just half-ass parenting - either be a fully committed parent or don't be a parent at all (and just contribute financially, if that's legally required where you are).\n\nHolding \"well YOU were the one who wanted to keep the baby\" over his GF's head as an excuse to be a less-involved parent is not healthy.", "Oh, absolutely. Just sayin\u2019, likely the pregnancy wasn\u2019t planned.", "Well, we aren\u2019t assuming it was a *choice*, only that the pregnancy wasn\u2019t planned prior to conception. That\u2019s the part of your response that made me want to respond\u2014the whole \u201cwhy are we assuming two teenagers planned a pregnancy?\u201d part. The decision to keep the baby was surely incredibly nuanced, with a lot of factors in play(religion, lack of sex ed, etc), but I just wanted to clarify that at no point was it mentioned that the two kids planned a pregnancy, and it is indeed unlikely they did so.", "Roe v wade was overturned in may the baby takes 10 months to cook and is already here. They had choices before roe v wade overturning came into effect. Not only that but where in this post does op say they\u2019re in the states? Roe only effected the US not every poster is in the US", "Entirely true. But the lack of info from OP in that regard leans more toward unprotected. More often than not, those who's condoms and pills fail make a point to include such info.", "Aussie, guilty", "Depending on what state/country you live in. Abortions aren't legal everywhere.", "That depends entirely on where they live and economic factors. You can no longer say she \"can just go get an abortion\" when it's actively being banned in many states. Its a very real possibility that neither of them wanted it and there was no other available option.", "Use a condom. The number of ppl here getting someone pregnant while using a condom don't add up, so i hope it isnt that excuse again.", "Right gtfo. She just takes care of the child and he gets to be a part time maybe dad. That BS. After the pandemic some many classes are online. He just doesn\u2019t want to help.", "This is what would end a relationship being like \"you gotta do what I say because x\" not even a \"hey maybe next semester take less classes or take classes closer so you can still pursue your dream but I can get more help\" relationships aren't so cut and dry like that. Compromise helps things last longer. Him and myself never said \"fuck then kids\" from what I can tell he's not shirking responsibility he's asking if him pursuing college makes him a dick wen he has a kid. I dont think so I just think they need to sit down and actually communicate.", "So they can be poor for 5 years cause the girl can't handle the kid? She needs to grow up and be a parent I did it she can too this guy helps and his parents help I had no one mondwy- Friday....education matters", "I took care of my baby from newborn-2 years with only her dad home on weekends.....she will be fine was my husband not a parent cause he had work?

I feel like I've heard that before....", "He put his DNA inside her, thats it. So far, that's his contribution. **She** was pregnant, not *both* of them.", "Multiple states already had abortion restrictions in place before the Dobbs decision.", "That\u2019s a very uninformed and shortsighted take.  Access to abortion still was problematic even before it was overturned.  Some states had 1 clinic for the whole state.  Many already had time limits which it\u2019s possible that the mother didn\u2019t know until it was too late.  Many children come from religious families and are pressured into.  We don\u2019t have enough info to make an informed decision.   I\u2019m not saying he\u2019s not the asshole.  I\u2019m just saying, a lot of you are quick to jump to YTA because of assumptions that you made.  Sorry, but my attorney brain just can\u2019t do that.", "Just because your partner is a deadbeat and your resigned to that doesn't mean everyone else should suffer", "You can get an education anytime in life. You only have one shot to father that child. Kid should come first IMO", "Your husband worked and provided money. OP isn\u2019t providing anything. He is in fact actually spending money. Going to college doesn\u2019t guarantee a high paying job at all anyway. I don\u2019t even use my degree. It\u2019s worthless like many other degrees.

He can do his first two years at community college and then transfer.  He\u2019s not trying to do better for his family.  He\u2019s going on to have the college experience he planned on, with pretty much no adjustment or sacrifice on his part.

The commenters whole argument was they may not have had a choice because of the overturning of roe. Roe wasn\u2019t overturned until may of this year. They had access to a choice when they got pregnant.  People don\u2019t have access to choices now.\nOh and nowhere in the post does OP state they\u2019re even in the states so maybe stop assuming that everyone that posts here lives in the states because if they don\u2019t guess what roe didn\u2019t effect another country.", "> Many children come from religious families and are pressured into.\n\nI see this opinion a lot. These \"religious families\" teach abstinence, right? So the teens have already broken that \"rule\" to get themselves into the situation of having an unplanned pregnancy.
