{"id": 23950, "submission_id": "15iyt83", "title": "AITA for going home while my brother is dealing with a custody battle?", "selftext": "I (41/f) have been living in NYC for the last 7 years. I grew up in a very small town in Pennsylvania but moved out in 2010 and had lived in a few other cities before landing in NYC where I started really building a life and am very happy there. I call that place home now. And it's only about a 3 hour drive from where the rest of my family lives in PA. I'm single, no kids, make a decent amount of money and I am able to WFH (self-employed) so I am pretty flexible in where in the world I can be. \n\nMy brother (46/m) has just gone through a terrible tragedy. He was in a relationship (31/f) for three years with a woman who had 2 kids (6/f and 3.5/f) from prior relationships. They were living together and had a happy little family thing going. He was essentially the kids step dad, although they werent married and there was no legal paperwork giving him rights. Well on July 6th she passed away. She had a quick moving infection that sent her into septic shock. This all struck within 24 hours and she lost consiousness while my brother was at work for the day. When he came home he took her to the hospital, they worked on her, she coded. The doctors were able to get her heart beating again but it took too long and she was braindead. Her parents decided to pull the plug the next morning and when they took her off the machine she was dead within two minutes. It was truly fucking tragic.\n\nOn top of that, her parents immediately took custody of the kids and will not allow my brother to see them. Or really even talk to them. He's broken up because he was their daddy for 3 years and he was a good daddy. He is pursuing his legal options to get custody of the kids (in PA non-biological caregivers have rights) and his lawyer said he is basically a shoe-in to get primary custody. \n\nI came to PA the day his girlfriend died to be there for my brother. I have been here for the last month now. I'm supporting him in all the ways I can (even paying for his lawyers retainer fee) and, you know, trying to be a good sister. \n\nThe other day I mentioned to him that I am starting to make plans to go back to the city around mid-september-october. This really really upset him. He basically told me I am abandoning him and his family. That he is working so hard to bring his family together while I am trying to tear it apart. I get that he's going through some shit so I'm giving him some slack on his reactions. I asked him to walk me through that thought a little bit. Basically he told me he's going to need help with the girls and I won't be around to do it. Then he said even outside of babysitting and stuff that I never visited enough and I'm basically telling him I dont want to see my nieces again.\n\nI dont really know how to move forward with this. I wanna check myself.

Your brother is attempting to cast you into the role of mother/babysitter.  Please stand firm and explain you have made an extraordinary effort for him but cannot make a lifetime commitment.", "NTA. If he can\u2019t manage the kids on his own, then maybe he shouldn\u2019t have primary custody of them in the first place.", "Your brother\u2019s life is with his kids and you are helping him get that aspect of his life back. *That\u2019s amazing.* Your life is in NYC and that life never went away- you set it aside to help him during a crisis when his world was upended. The fact that he expected otherwise is a personal problem.\n\nI see two issues here:\n1. He doesn\u2019t recognize that your life is just as valid as his own. If he did, he wouldn\u2019t have automatically assumed that you would be giving yours up forever. That assumption is incredibly disrespectful.\n2. Because he assumed you would voluntarily share parenting duties with him, he didn\u2019t have a realistic expectation of just how difficult single parenthood would actually be. Now he\u2019s upset that he\u2019ll truly have to be a *single* parent.\n3. Claiming that you don\u2019t want to see your nieces again just because you never signed up to be their pseudo-mother is manipulative and shitty.\n\nNTA\n\nIt\u2019s a good thing you mentioned it now. Imagine if he went in front of a judge and told them that you would be sharing parenting responsibilities with him, just for the court to later discover this to be false? Ffs, his inappropriate assumption could have fucked his legal case to get his kids.", "NTA, Although your Brother is going through an awful situation , you still have your own life to live and it seems pretty unreasonable of your Brother to assume you will up sticks because of his circumstances, especially when you say the rest of your Family is in PA, so he will have support.\n\nGrief and Stress don't mix well, give him time and hopefully he'll see sense.", "NTA.  You have your own life, he can't expect you to uproot your life for him.", "NTA - this is his grief and stress talking. You have a right to live your life and that\u2019s not in PA.  You\u2019ve already been physically and financially there to help him transition into life without his significant other.  Staying longer can also keep him from finding his \u201cnew normal\u201d.", "NTA\n\nDon't down vote me but you need to go back to your life \n\nIf he is to get custody then he has to prove he is suitable.

By all means, stay until Octoberish and help him get a plan in place, and come back once a month until thing are more settled. He needs to look into a nanny or au pair. Tell him you'll help him get things set up and will visit often, but his kids are his responsibility.", "NTA. OP, your brother is unreasonable to demand that you give up your home base of 7 years to help him with children he doesn\u2019t even have custody of or currently allowed to see.  His behavior to you is *unacceptable* imho and makes me question whether he should even have custody of his late girlfriend\u2019s children.  Depending on whether the bio grandparents were [documented] as abusive or estranged from their daughter, I\u2019m dubious that his lawyer said his getting custody was a shoe in.  Your brother could probably benefit grief therapy, grief at the loss of his significant other and maybe guilt that he and she did not do what was necessary to ensure the children were legally in his custody in the event of her death. Or that they were provided for in the event of his death.", "NTA\n\nso he wants sole custody of children he isn't prepared to take care of by himself? \n\nGrief is terrible and it's awful his life imploded, but i don't think he's coming at the situation realistically. He has a few years investment in those kids. The children have grandparents who are taking care of them. They aren't on the street or in the system. They are with family members who have been invested since before they were born, since before your brother even met any of them. \n\nIn the event he gets custody of the kids away from their family, does he expect you to move in and take them to doctors appointments and handle making breakfasts and lunches? Because it kinda sounds like it. \n\nYou deserve to live your life. Condolences from an internet stranger.", "NTA. Leave. He wants to use you.", "NTA  You have the right to get back to your life. His decisions and life are not your responsibility!", "NTA, move back, and offer the one last helpful bit of advice that if he wants to have custody he'll need to have all the childcare and services already lined up.", "So... he wants to get custody of the kids so YOU can be their parent?", "NTA. Your brother is in grief obviously and isn\u2019t making rational decisions. As nice as it is to support him you got your own life to live and he needs to get some help from a professional so he can get is life and family back in order.", "NTA\n\nYour life is not in the same city. You have gone to him to support him and he say that. He needs to be realistic about what you can offer and not assume.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
