We all work at the same big-box retail store and we've all worked our way up to being department managers. We see each other almost every day and share a lot of personal details of our lives, which includes discussing stuff like bills and budgeting. I live with my parents, Marie lives in her grandma's basement, and (we thought) Jessica still lived in her grandma's old trailer, which is the reason she gave for never having people over. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nRecently there was some local drama and the land for Jessica's whole trailer park was abruptly sold to a corporation, which means that everybody's leases are up in the air.  We told Jessica that she could stay with us for awhile if the corporation kicked her out and she said she appreciated it, but everything would be okay. Marie's uncle is a lawyer and swooped in to get everyone in the trailer park together for a case, but when Marie asked him about how it was going and about Jessica, he said that he didn't know who that was. So I did a public records search and discovered that six months ago, Jessica had bought a $250,000 house/land outright.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAfter we asked (semi-jokingly) if she was a drug dealer, Jessica admitted that she won about $700,000 gambling two years ago and she didn't want to tell anyone. Marie and I were upset, and I told her that she not only let us worry about her living situation, but that we had commiserated with her about everything from our tires going bald, to couponing for food, to fighting hospitals about medical bills that aren't right. She countered and said that she's not \"set for life\" or a millionaire, and that I shouldn't be looking her up online anyway and being nosy. AITA?\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**ETA:** I do not want her money, and I have not asked her for money. At the time I told her I didn't like that she commiserated with me and Marie about things like (for example) finding a quarter behind the vending machine, or being stressed about a medical bill, or waiting just a little longer to get new tires because ours are bald, when she knew she was flush with cash and Marie and I thought we were all in the same boat.", "created_utc": 1683231488, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/137ynh8/aita_for_doing_a_public_records_search_on_my/", "score": 203, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If she felt safe in being open with you, she would have. Obviously she didn\u2019t \u2014 that says a lot more about you and your other friend than it does her.

None of these are private information", "Basically, this girl is not their friend", "The lawyer didn't tell her about anyone participating in the case since the co-worker wasn't participating", "I will disagree a little. My husband and I bought our house around 10 years ago. We thought it was just a cosmetic fixer. Yeah, turns out it's a complete money pit. We had to replace the roof on the house and garage (both had to be complete tear-offs), new furnace, water heater and air conditioner. Had to have chimneys capped because birds kept flying in and raccoons would occasionally fall down them. The useable fireplace needed relined and needs a yearly cleaning. The stove, washing machine and dryer all died over the years and had to be replaced.\n\nPlumbing issues up the wazoo from every corner. Several times a year we have to have our main sewer line professionally cleaned out and it occasionally backs up in the basement. The pipe is degrading and roots are starting to intrude through. It really needs replaced but we can't afford it, particularly when other big repairs keep popping up. I could go on, but you get the idea.\n\nWe also keep having unexpected vet costs pop up. In December one of our dogs had to be at the emergency vet for 4-5 days. That was a nice $4600 bill. Which had to go on a credit card bringing the balance to around $8,000. So paying that off had to be a priority. Then there are medical costs. Last summer my husband needed a root canal and crown and our portion of the bill was around $2,000. Again, I could go on.\n\nSo even though my husband makes 6 figures, our house if pretty much unfurnished. It practically looks the same as the day we moved in 10 years ago. A lot of our belongings are still in the moving boxes. What few items we do have are either things the previous owners left when they moved or hand me downs from his late parents. A lot of our kitchen items are also hand me downs or wedding gifts. We literally sit in camping chairs in our kitchen. In 10 years we've bought one bed frame, 3 mattresses, curtains for one room, 2 light fixtures, 3 kitchen stools, and a table. The table is library table we won at a library auction years ago and intend to use as a dining table. But we haven't been able to purchase dining chairs yet. Hence the camping chairs. EVERY time we start to think we are getting ahead, nope here comes another shot.\n\nThe amount of money indicates absolutely NOTHING about Jess' financial situation. We don't go around telling our friends we don't have furniture and the house needs a ton of repairs. Part of the reason we loved the house was the layout is PERFECT for entertaining. We dreamed about being able to host my husband's whole family on a holiday. Yeah, the only people that have been to the house are workmen and my parents (a couple of times). Moving boxes everywhere. Barely anywhere for anyone to sit and what is available is all janky and beat to hell. It's embarrassing.\n\nWe have some savings. Which are kept for emergencies (which seem to crop up a couple of times a year). We also have some investments that are for retirement. My husband's is in an IRA so he would take a huge penalty if he pulled any money out early. \n\nAgain, my husband makes 6 figures. But we still have to budget and save up for things. Like when we realized the oven wasn't working properly and couldn't be fixed, I made do only using the burner until the big appliance says. That was a few months, but I was able to score a $1200 stove for $400. Did the same with the washer and dryer. So there were several months of my husband taking all of our laundry to the laundromat. All the cars we've owned were bought used. The current one we bought when the mechanic told us if we kept driving the previous one the wheels were LITERALLY going to fall off. \n\nDon't get me wrong. I am not trying to \"woe is me\" or paint us as super struggling. I KNOW we are absurdly lucky. We're able to pay all the bills, we have a whole ass house, reliable transportation , zero food insecurity, great health insurance, savings, etc. I know a large portion of the country can't say the same and that is absolutely awful and 100% unfair.  I'm just providing the info to make the point that Jess may not be lying about her current financial situation.
