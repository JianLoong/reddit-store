We all work at the same big-box retail store and we've all worked our way up to being department managers. We see each other almost every day and share a lot of personal details of our lives, which includes discussing stuff like bills and budgeting. I live with my parents, Marie lives in her grandma's basement, and (we thought) Jessica still lived in her grandma's old trailer, which is the reason she gave for never having people over. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nRecently there was some local drama and the land for Jessica's whole trailer park was abruptly sold to a corporation, which means that everybody's leases are up in the air.  We told Jessica that she could stay with us for awhile if the corporation kicked her out and she said she appreciated it, but everything would be okay. Marie's uncle is a lawyer and swooped in to get everyone in the trailer park together for a case, but when Marie asked him about how it was going and about Jessica, he said that he didn't know who that was. So I did a public records search and discovered that six months ago, Jessica had bought a $250,000 house/land outright.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAfter we asked (semi-jokingly) if she was a drug dealer, Jessica admitted that she won about $700,000 gambling two years ago and she didn't want to tell anyone. Marie and I were upset, and I told her that she not only let us worry about her living situation, but that we had commiserated with her about everything from our tires going bald, to couponing for food, to fighting hospitals about medical bills that aren't right. She countered and said that she's not \"set for life\" or a millionaire, and that I shouldn't be looking her up online anyway and being nosy. AITA?\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**ETA:** I do not want her money, and I have not asked her for money. At the time I told her I didn't like that she commiserated with me and Marie about things like (for example) finding a quarter behind the vending machine, or being stressed about a medical bill, or waiting just a little longer to get new tires because ours are bald, when she knew she was flush with cash and Marie and I thought we were all in the same boat.", "created_utc": 1683231488, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/137ynh8/aita_for_doing_a_public_records_search_on_my/", "score": 72, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Think about the kind of person you are and why she identified this trait in you which led her to keeping her mouth shut.

If she felt safe in being open with you, she would have. Obviously she didn\u2019t \u2014 that says a lot more about you and your other friend than it does her.

This is exactly why she didn't want to tell anyone about the money. Also if she's a gambler she might not be joking when she says she's not set for life.  It could all be gone by Christmas.", "YTA.

I am guessing Jessica knew how you and Marie would react to her having some money, and that is why she kept it from you.  And, given your behavior, she was smart to do it.", "Like all of them", "[removed]", "You admitted that you wouldn\u2019t treat her the same *because she had money.* You wouldn\u2019t speak to her in the same way as you would when you thought she was still in the same boat as you. If she told you the *day* she won that money, you wouldn\u2019t be treating her the same because you\u2019d be envious of the fact that she has money now, and wouldn\u2019t talk with her about your personal struggles anymore.", "Basically, the only way she can win with you is to stop talking to you altogether, which is what you clearly want, and what will be best for her.", "You do realize if she won $700K probably almost half of that was paid for gambling tax? Or if she got installments it might be just enough to cover the mortgage? She probably withheld the information because\u2026drum roll\u2026IT. IS. NOT. YOUR. BUSINESS. Maybe she has debt she needs to pay off and is struggling. Maybe the $250K house was a solid investment for her because she pays less for a mortgage than for rent. Maybe\u2026IT IS NOT YOUR BUSINESS. Honestly, I wouldn\u2019t be friends with you either because you sound judgmental. What grown-ass person looks up another\u2019s financials. Grow up. Oh, and YTA.", "The fact that you actually did it is what makes it YTA.", "Doesn't make it less weird", "Like I said, my issue is that she flat-out lied to us. That's what our argument was largely about.", "Okay, why is it fine for her to lie to us? Why can I not be upset about that?", "Well, where we are that isn't the case, but that sucks.", "How am I dumb for not having every state's gambling laws memorized? Mine doesn't tax gambling winnings at the state level, they're only taxed at the federal level.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

I understand being upset your friend lied. That is an asshole act, I am not disagreeing with you. Sometimes people lie to not make others around them feel bad. Still a lie, not good to lie to friends. \n\nHowever, because of the assholery level you displayed with your recon efforts and your reaction to your findings, I hope you can try and see why your friend felt the need to lie.", "No one ever made that part of your assholery, we're literally talking about *your actions* not your feelings.", "Do you know how many people don't tell others when they have money? It's because of people like you and Marie that others feel they have to lie about having money. Obviously, you couldn't be trusted with the knowledge. You have no reason to be upset that somebody didn't share something so personal with you. I guarantee you, and you're gonna deny it, but we all know it's true, you have lied to people about something because you didn't think it was their business, we have all done it.\n\nTake your judgment, apologize to her, and count yourself down one friend because if she's smart, she'll definitely never deal with you again.", "She didn't lie.", "Idk where you are but I guarantee half-ish of that is taxes", "Yes, she did in fact lie to us. For example, her car was hit and she took it to a dealership notorious for holding onto people's cars who couldn't pay. She told us she wouldn't need rides to/from work when we offered because she managed to get a payment plan, got them to lower the cost of labor, but she was \"sweating it\" and \"things'll be tight for awhile but I'll manage.\" She's also talked about \"having to put things on the [credit] card\" before, but now she's told us she just has cash in the bank.", "How do you know the friend lied though?  All anyone knows is that she spent $250k of whatever winnings were left over after taxes buying a property.  No one here knows what she did with the rest of the money.  She may very well have spent the rest on debts, family, charity, who knows.  And OP's behaviour shows exactly why she chose not to naturally divulge even the land purchase.  OP is assuming she's rolling in cash when nothing about her friend's lifestyle appears to have changed except that she now owns property, and they weren't even aware of that.", "I'm looking at our state and federal law and it's 24% total."]}
