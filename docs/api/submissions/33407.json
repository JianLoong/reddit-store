He was on his way to work and got into an accident. I loved my dad and have missed him so much since he died. Mom and I both went into grief therapy after his death. She went for about 6 months. I went for almost 3 years.\n\nA few months before I stopped attending therapy my mom met \"Mark\". I didn't meet him for like a year and a bit after but mom told me she was dating someone and then when they became boyfriend and girlfriend. They got married like 7 months after I met him. I was 12.\n\nEven before they got married Mark and my mom would call me their daughter and say I was their kid. He would tell people I was his daughter when he met them. Whereas I always called him my mom's husband or fianc\u00e9 before they got married.\n\nIt bothers my mom and Mark that I don't tell people he's my dad or say \"my parents\" when I'm talking about both. \n\nOver the years they have told me it would mean a lot to Mark if I were to introduce him as my dad. Or she said I could say bonus dad, but not stepdad, since that sounds far more insignificant in terms of the role he plays in my life.\n\nI have never done this. But for a couple of years now my mom has told me I should be better than this, I should think about someone else's feelings above my own. That it would cost me nothing to let people see him as my parent instead of instantly delegating him to just the dude she's married to. She has gone on and on about thinking about his feelings and not putting my own first the whole time.\n\nLately it has been getting to me so when mom said it to me (17f) a couple of weeks ago I told her she should try holding her husband to the same standard she holds me to and ask him to put my feelings on this before his own. \n\nMy mom told me he already has to do that day after day when I refuse to acknowledge him as a dad in my life. I told her he had a choice on whether he wanted to marry her and take me on. I never got a choice in his place in my life. But I told her I am taking back that right to choose what he is to me whether she likes it or not.\n\nShe told me it was petty for me to claim he needs to be held to the same standard when his actions don't hurt me but mine hurt him.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1703057998, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18mp3a2/aita_for_telling_my_mom_she_should_hold_her/", "score": 955, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your feelings might have been different had he filled the fatherly role in a way that made you want to call him \"Dad\", but even then, your sense of connection to your actual dad may preclude you ever wanting to refer to anyone else that way. They should respect this.", "When I married my wife, she already had children. Their dad was still in the picture, but pretty useless as a father/role model. I never insisted the kids called me anything but what they wanted to. They referred to me as Mums husband for a bit, then stepdad for a while, and by my name as they got older.\nWhen the eldest had her first little one, she passed me her baby, and said \"meet your grandad\".\nI don't care what my kids call me, they know I am family.", "You suffered a traumatic loss at a young age, and whatever you choose to call Mark should be up to you, not them. I understand it would be difficult to refer to Mark as \u201cmy dad\u201d because you feel like you would be dishonoring the memory of the dad you lost. \n\nPerhaps you could try to find a calm moment and discuss this with both of them, saying something that both acknowledged their feelings and Mark\u2019s role in your lives while also protecting your wishes, like \u201cMark, I am grateful to have you in our lives and appreciate everything you have done for me, but I had a person in my life that called \u2018Dad,\u2019 and it doesn\u2019t feel right to me or my memory of him to call anyone else that. I hope you understand this isn\u2019t meant to hurt or disrespect either of you in any way.  It\u2019s just how I feel.\u201d Or whatever works for your particular situation.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Everything you said was true. You didn't choose him. She did. You aren't obligated to like or even tolerate the choices she makes in her life, let alone play along their little game of fantasy-charades. In reality, he *isn't* your dad. The fact that she's trying to force you to think of him as a \"replacement\" is fucked-up enough without adding the other stuff into it. Honestly, you're very strong-willed for holding true about this, even if it comes from a dark place of hurt and trauma. Even still, it should be respected.\n\nIf it comes up again, you should ask your mother why she consistently places her new dick over her only daughter. You're the only living memory of her dead husband. If she values his memory so little that she actively tramples the will of his only legacy, it's no wonder she took only 6 months to get over what took you 3 years.\n\nHonestly, it just sounds like she doesn't value you as much as she values her new guy friend.", "NTA. You had a father. You have memories about him. Your mother chose Mark, you didn't. He is your stepdad, you can love him very much BUT you have no obligations to consider him as your dad. \n\nYour mother is insecure in her relationship. If she was clear with her new husband, she could face the fact you don't call him \"daddy\". IT's great that he wants to be a father for you but he never asked you first, he just  acted like so, even if he met you at 12. It can't work that way, you're not a dog that had change of owner. You lost your dad. You loved him. And I think a psychologist would say the \"forcing\" from Mark and your mother makes you feel they try to erase your dad's memory. So the more they try to force you to say \"dad\" to Mark, the less you'll do it. \n\nThese things must come naturally. Mayve it's too late because you met him when you were a teenager, you were constructing yourself from childhood from adulthood, this strange period everything is difficult, different, and sometimes sad. And they didn't permit you to express your own desire, feelings. \n\nDon't feel guilty. Mark is your mother husband, they chose each other, and you have the right to keep a distance with Mark, even if he pays bill, it doesn't make him a father for you.", "NTA\n\nMy second husband is my daughter's stepdad for 8 years now. She still calls him stepdad or by his first name. Sometimes she called him dad, and then corrected herself.\n\nHe said it's her choice, but his heart did melt when she called her dad every single time.\n\nMy first husband and I are still very good friends. We see each other at every family function, every holiday. He was always open to spending time with his daughter, and I always made sure she gets as much time as possible with him when she wanted to.\n\nNow that her half brother is born, my second husband is his dad. My daughter and I talked about if she wants to call him dad now. She said she doesn't want to confuse the two in her head. Only one dad allowed apparently.\n\nWe talked about maybe calling him Papi instead of Papa (German for Daddy instead of Dad), and she tried it a couple of days and then decided against it.\n\nWhen talking to her brother, she would refer to her stepdad as dad, but never when talking about herself.\n\nAnd you know what? That's fine.\n\nSame as her keeping my old last name (my first husband took mine), to share her last name with her dad.\n\nWe talked about it. She made the decision without any pressure. She's 12 now, and she's perfectly fine telling her stepdad she loves him. She does. And he loves her.\n\nHe's a wonderful stepdad in her eyes. The best she can wish for. He's just not her dad.\n\nTrying to force you was wrong. It killed any chance the two of them ever had in making you pick that title for him yourself. You had to push back against them, against them stomping your feelings.\n\nThey put you between a rock and a hard place to begin with. Your reasoning is clear.\n\nBy pushing over the boundary again and again, your mother will slowly alienate you.\n\nI'm sorry, by the way. You deserved better.", "NTA\u2026they need to drop it.  What a strange thing for them to bring up regularly\u2026.especially when they see that it harms you.", "\u201cMy mom has told me I should be better than this, I should think about someone else\u2019s feelings above my own.\u201d\n\nYeah, mom should definitely take her own advice here. The adults are the ones refusing to consider the feelings of the actual child.\n\nYou are spot on. Sorry you\u2019re dealing with this, OP.\n\nNTA", "I am a stepmother and would never ever EVER try to force my stepdaughters to call me a certain thing. And the thought of asking them to is pretty weird to me. They can call me whatever they feel like and if they called me mom knowing they didn\u2019t want to I would feel terrible and sad. That would almost feel worse than anything I could think of them calling me.", "NTA. My mother remarried twice. Both to really good men. I called the first husband dad when I was 12, but stopped once they divorced. However I still keep in touch with him. Mum remarried about 8 years ago and he a really good husband to my mother. However he will never be my dad. \n\nFor the record, I do have trouble calling my bio father dad. That's another story.", "Uhhh it seems like his actions do hurt you tho? Is your mom blind? NTA", "NTA. You were absolutely right in what you said. Your mother is out of line for what she said and should probably head back to therapy.", "NTA. It\u2019s his job to be the adult, and he is not your bio dad. I still don\u2019t call my stepdad \u201cdad\u201d or any variant but I love him just as much as my bio dad (I did change him in my phone to be listed as dad though, he doesn\u2019t know. It\u2019s just too weird to suddenly switch from \u201cfirst name\u201d to \u201cdad\u201d after 30 years) \nIf he loves you unconditionally, he will keep loving you unconditionally. Sometimes kids hurt their parents, but if he keeps loving you then one day you may feel a closer bond and trust from having him respect your autonomy and not pressuring you! It will also mean far more to him in the distant future if you guys are able to forge that closer bond that\u2019s earned from true respect.", "I just don\u2019t get these parents/step-parents who push this kind of thing. My dad is step-dad to my sister. He became part of her life when she was 9 and for all intents-and-purposes raised her. She asked him rather than her bio dad to walk her down the aisle, etc. But she has always called him her step-dad (and by his first name) and that has never meant he means less to her. Equally I have a friend who calls his step-dad \u201cdad\u201d and was formally adopted by him, etc. both of these are full and meaningful relationships for the people in them, even if one doesn\u2019t have the \u201cHallmark movie\u201d traits that people are so attracted to.", "Right off the bat, NTA.\n\n>Even before they got married Mark and my mom would call me their daughter and say I was their kid. He would tell people I was his daughter when he met them. Whereas I always called him my mom's husband or fianc\u00e9 before they got married.\n\nThat's where Mark and your mother failed. As much as Mark wanted to play a fatherly role, he went the wrong way and made the wrong call. Having read plenty of posts coming from stepchildren having gone through a similar situation, forcing the stepchild to accept the stepparent as the parent has never left to happy resolutions. What I have seen is that those who \"show, don't tell\", that is, those that respect the child and follow the child's lead when it comes to parental needs and are there unconditionally, including while NOT being called parent, have the best outcomes. Unfortunately, you did not get that, quite the opposite actually. It comes off as trying to erase the father you lost at 7 yo, which is totally AH behavior.\n\n>It bothers my mom and Mark that I don't tell people he's my dad or say \"my parents\" when I'm talking about both. \n\nToo bad for them; that's how things are and they made sure by how they acted that it would stay that way.\n\nAgain, NTA.", "But\u2026 his actions DOES hurt you? By erasing your dad? NTA obviously", "You're being nicer than I would be, to both of them to shut the fuck up.\n\nYou already know you're NTA", "NTA.

It\u2019s like saying \u201cpretend to love me!\u201d", "NTA", "They got married when you were 12, thats only 5 years (ish) that he has been in your life. Why in the world would you call him dad after this long when you had your real father aroubd for 7 years? Mark can be a 'father figure' but there is no need to pressure you to call him anything else apart from his actual name", "Honestly, what a mature response!  Asking your mom and (for lack of a better description) stepparent to consider your feelings isn't a big ask.  Any parent should not only be able to understand this, but do this.  \n\nNTA", "NTA and wannabe \u201cdad\u201d needs to quit thinking of himself. He is a stepfather. It is what it is.", "NTA. Your mother is ignoring the fact that it sounds like his actions did/do hurt you.

Can't have been easy losing him and then later not being given a say in how you address your mom's new love.", "NTA.  \n\n\nThe sad thing about this is, if people like your mom and step dad stay back and allow the relationship to develop naturally, they could possibly become a very special parent figure, possibly even with their own parental name.  \"Pop\" instead of \"dad\" or the like.   \n\n\nThe fact that these people make it all about themselves and their feelings is, imho, the biggest problem here.  \n\n\nThese folks: \"but I WANT to be called 'dad/mom' it hurts my feelings...\"\n\nAny normal adult should be able to see that it's not about them and that it's just so darned selfish to push the issue and ...frankly, walk all over someone else's right to their own choices.", "NTA\n\nShe should quit being selfish and expecting you to play happy doll family for her public image.

She is the one who is absolutely in the wrong.", "NTA. Your feelings should matter. But why is your mother acting as the gatekeeper between you and your stepdad? \n\nThat is most decidedly not her place. If you were abusing him, or vice versa, she\u2019d have standing to protect you from each other. But that isn\u2019t the case here. She believes that he is hurt. You are hurt that she disregards her feelings. Both sides of that issue belong to you and her husband, not to her. \n\nNext time she brings this up, and you know she will, tell her that you want to have a conversation about this with HIM.

Maybe have a chat to them and see if they can talk some sense into your mum. \n\nOr ask your mum how she would feel if she had been the one to die and your dad had remarried and expected you to accept his new wife as mum and totally erase her memory from your mind.

If your mum and stepdad hadn't been so obsessed with playing happy families then that natural connection very well may have grown over time, but instead they've pushed their feelings on to you and in turn, naturally, resentment has bloomed. \n\nBoundaries are so important, and it's something that parents should educate their children on from a young age, that and no is a full sentence. You are not at fault, you had your dad and lost him in a tragic accident, nobody will ever replace him and your mum needs to realise that.\n\n(I also wonder if she never truly healed from the loss of your dad, only six months in therapy really feels like surface level rather than dealing with trauma.)", "NTA\n\nTell your mom you would like to start family therapy. A therapist may be able to (slowly) get through to both your mom and stepdad that it's not your job to validate stepdad. It's their job to nurture, care for, and protect you. You need to treat each of them with respect and civility, but you don't owe them honors or specific emotions that validate them. (I say this as a mom of teens.) The therapist may help them understand that - if stepdad could just meet you where you are at and allow the relationship you are comfortable with having with him build naturally - that relationship will be the best one he could possibly have.\n\nIf there are any other adults in your life that can help you talk with them, that might be another avenue. If you can't get through to them, just treat them with as much respect and civility as you can (hard, I know, given that you are going through the teen years AND they are not respecting you, your feelings or your autonomy).

It very well may be that he became your \u2018practicing father\u2019 and maybe he has legitimate reasons to feel that way. But the dead of a parent is heavy especially at that age. You can\u2019t really replace a parent with an another one after a loss like this. \n\nThe whole meaning of what my dad was, what he means to me changed considerably over the years after his passing.

Our life flashes through our eyes. Why? Because we get to look upon all our fond memories and feel the fear of the loss our disappearance from our loved ones lives have upon them. I say this, because if I passed on and left a daughter behind? I would hope my significant other would eventually move on and find a man that would be able to provide my child what I always lacked. A father. Mind you, my real father did very horrible things to my sister and I. My mother disappeared from our lives quickly. But my grandparents managed to finally get custody of us. It took a while for me to warm up to my grandfather [not related by blood.] But I eventually started calling him dad. He passed away 12 years later when I was 15 and I think about him every day. What I could have done, things I could have said when he was abruptly taken away by the big C. My real father meant nothing to me. My grandfather is the one I call dad. Still to this day I call him dad. But my grandmother [whom I call mom. Even though my real mother is in my life now. I call out mom, both respond. Lol] dated around for a while until she got remarried a a few years later. It took me a couple of years to warm up to him too. But I started calling him dad. Why? I don't think my dad [my grandfather,] would mind at all. Because I like to believe in his fleeting moments he may have considered what would become of my sister and I on his departure. [Because mom made it clear she didn't know if she could raise us the rest of the way without him. She pulled through. Haha.] But she even eventually asked me to call her new husband dad too. Mind you, I was in my early twenties and I had trouble with it too. Felt like it was expected of me, but his kindness and humor wormed its way into my heart. I don't think dad would mind either. Any man who can step into a relationship like that? Especially to raise another mans child and hopefully one day maybe, be called dad too? It is just an endearing title. They know they're not your dad. But it takes a man who everyone should respect wanting that role. Because if he is at least trying to fill that role, hoping one day to hear it from you? He's at least respectful. Although, they should have let you come to the decision yourself. But maybe after all these years? He might have started to think he was inadequate, maybe not living up to the standards of love your own father gave you. I don't think my father would mind, nor do I think yours would either.

Does he treat you well? Does he do dad things with you? For you? Is he good to your mom? Does he ever make you feel less than? Or throw it in your face that you aren\u2019t his by blood? These questions would make a difference to me. You shouldn\u2019t be pressured into calling him something you aren\u2019t comfortable with. Maybe go out to lunch with him just the two of you, tell him how you feel and why you feel those things. He may just not understand. Your mom may be pressuring it, who knows. But you should talk to him about it. See what happens and go from there. If you can answer all of those questions above positively wouldn\u2019t your dad be thankful for him? Wouldn\u2019t your dad be happy he is good to you two and not a horrible man that causes you hurt? Your dad isn\u2019t up there upset at the thought of you calling another man dad.

He was on his way to work and got into an accident. I loved my dad and have missed him so much since he died. Mom and I both went into grief therapy after his death. She went for about 6 months. I went for almost 3 years.\n\nA few months before I stopped attending therapy my mom met \"Mark\". I didn't meet him for like a year and a bit after but mom told me she was dating someone and then when they became boyfriend and girlfriend. They got married like 7 months after I met him. I was 12.\n\nEven before they got married Mark and my mom would call me their daughter and say I was their kid. He would tell people I was his daughter when he met them. Whereas I always called him my mom's husband or fianc\u00e9 before they got married.\n\nIt bothers my mom and Mark that I don't tell people he's my dad or say \"my parents\" when I'm talking about both. \n\nOver the years they have told me it would mean a lot to Mark if I were to introduce him as my dad. Or she said I could say bonus dad, but not stepdad, since that sounds far more insignificant in terms of the role he plays in my life.\n\nI have never done this. But for a couple of years now my mom has told me I should be better than this, I should think about someone else's feelings above my own. That it would cost me nothing to let people see him as my parent instead of instantly delegating him to just the dude she's married to. She has gone on and on about thinking about his feelings and not putting my own first the whole time.\n\nLately it has been getting to me so when mom said it to me (17f) a couple of weeks ago I told her she should try holding her husband to the same standard she holds me to and ask him to put my feelings on this before his own. \n\nMy mom told me he already has to do that day after day when I refuse to acknowledge him as a dad in my life. I told her he had a choice on whether he wanted to marry her and take me on. I never got a choice in his place in my life. But I told her I am taking back that right to choose what he is to me whether she likes it or not.\n\nShe told me it was petty for me to claim he needs to be held to the same standard when his actions don't hurt me but mine hurt him.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If he had been more respectful and less intrusive when you were young; if they had taken their relationship at a normal pace and given you time to acclimatise pre marriage; if she had actually defended your space and your right to progress your relationship with him at your own pace - *then* you would have learned to trust him and might have started feeling like he was a bonus dad to you, even if never a replacement. Step-parents forcing the relationship and stomping the child\u2019s feelings is what blocks this sort of bonding.\n\nHell, tell them that the first thing they need to do to build that relationship is make up for that pressure - which means they walk it back, they apologise, and they don\u2019t pressure you about it or talk at you about it for *at minimum* as long as they have been pressuring you.

They may lose you over this. NTA.", "NTA\n\nNext time your Mom says it doesn\u2019t hurt you, you could say it certainly does and explain how you feel. For example if you feel like they are trying to replace or erase your dad.", "I really feel this sort of arguments, like the ones from Mark and your mother, are guilt tripping you into calling Mark \"dad\" (or \"pops\" or anything of the sort), when you've made it absolutely clear that those words have a real, deep meaning to you, and you simply don't want to call that any other person who isn't your father. And, in my opinion, you are right: you have a father. He didn't stop being your father when he died, as you didn't stop being his daughter. Love and bonding don't work like that. That bond will never cease to exist. Mark might be a perfect husband to your mother or a great provider (his choice, btw). None of that matters in this case, because you shouldn't be forced to go against something so meaningful to you out of gratitude. Forced gratitude. Because you are not being ungrateful for not giving in. You don't owe Mark \"dad\", as much as he, or your mom, or anyone may want you to. I think your feelings and reasoning are perfectly understandable, and that they should be respected, even when not shared. \nNTA.", "Then you need to sit them down and explain that, maybe apologize to Mark if he feels disappointment so he won't lament on if he could've done something different to make you love him. I only say that, because you may not love him. But I hope at least you'll approve of their relationship and not want to see him emotionally hurt from the exchange. Just stay calm, stay collected, and explain. If they get mad at you for even that or don't calm down? Then you've only got 1 year until you're 18 [or months,] not a long time to stick it out before you can move on. You may not see him there for your happiness, because you just can't see him like that. But he can still be there for your mothers happiness.", "That is your answer then. Tell them that. It may sting a bit but it\u2019s the truth. Tell them how disrespectful it is to ask you to do something so personal to them. It sounds like they are trying to make you do it for the wrong reasons. Like in front of others or something which is even worse", "Yeah, she has a father - the man who raised her, was there for her, supported her, loved her, sacrificed for her, stayed up nights and got up early for her, fed her, housed her, helped her through difficult years.\n\nShe has a two fathers. She's being very unfair to one of them. It's a very small ask, that she acknowledge the role her second dad took on voluntarily and dedicated himself to. It doesn't mean erasing her first father. Love and respect are not finite. Loving your second dad in no way replaces the love and honor and grief you have for your first dad.\n\nI say this as a child of a mother, a bio father, a stepfather, a godmother and godfather, and a momma bear. And various siblings. I'm so blessed to have all those people care for me.\n\nSometimes water is thicker than blood. I think the people who *put in the time* are just as important as the people I'm biologically related to. If my family was restricted to just bio, I'd barely have one. Instead, I've had a wonderful life, because these people cared enough, and worked enough, to help me make one.\n\nCall him your bonus dad. He is. And I bet your bio dad is stoked that you had a father figure in your life.

Of course OP isn't obligated to call anyone \"dad\" purely because of who the man is married to, but calling your mother's husband of five years \"her new dick\" and loudly proclaiming that you don't approve of her choices is certainly A H behavior.", "There are certain personal things I don't really love about him either. But the biggest issue is the whole \"dad\" thing and the fact he and my mom push the issue so much.\n\nHe and my mom both provide. He does try.", "I have explained it to them before. My mom and Mark say I choose to let it hurt me because I refuse to let love in after my dad, because of fear, and that it isn't healthy. But they fail to see I have formed really awesome relationships since the death of my dad. Mark just isn't one of them.", "I agree, a rational conversation needs to be had. Tell them your feelings. But really think about it first: Since getting remarried, has your mother's life been easier? How about you? Do you live in a better home? Have possessions you wouldn't have otherwise? Are you benefiting from Mark being in your life? If yes, you need to acknowledge this in the conversation, as well as in your own emotions - teach yourself to be grateful for the things he does do. It's OK to be firm in that you'll never call him dad, because you cannot replace your dad. But maybe try to come up with an alternate name that would be acceptable to everyone, like Pops, or some such.", "I have told them. They simply insist it's an unhealthy thing after my dad died because I don't let love in.", "This is such a dumb take. If it's such a small thing (it isn't)  as you say, why does it matter to the stepdad? \nAlso you made a lot of assumptions about what this man has and hasn't done for OP. \nCalling yourself a parent and actually being a parent are two totally different things. If someone steps up out of love and compassion then the 'reward' of being called 'dad' shouldn't matter. \nOP's dad died when they were a child. It is absolutely reasonable to never want to replace that person in any way even if just by name. \nThe story reads like the stepdad has always just tried to take the 'dad' name without any consideration to how \nOP felt about that while still grieving the dad they knew.\nThis alone is enough to never deserve being called dad. It's disrespectful to both OP and the memory of the real father.\nEdit: OP is NTA", "Found the step-dad.", "Yikes.", "Do you know for sure he has done all that? And how do you know her bio dad would be \u201cstoked\u201d? Just because you had a good experience doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s the same for everyone in that situation. This is just a bunch of assumptions and projection.", "\u201csometimes water is thicker than blood?\u201d I don\u2019t think you know the phrase correctly. \n\n\u201cThe blood of the convent is thicker than the water of the womb\u201d meaning relationships and loyalties you create yourself are far more important than the ones you don\u2019t choose. \n\nMany shorten the phrase and often use it to emotionally blackmail those that want to cut ties with toxic family.", "Gross.", "He was foisted upon her with zero choices in the matter. It\u2019s admirable that her step dad loves her so much, but part of becoming a step parent is meeting that child where the child is. If said child doesn\u2019t wanna call you mom/dad, you don\u2019t get to dictate that. You don\u2019t get to dictate their relationship with you or what they call you. You can only dictate your side, which should be support. And if one can\u2019t handle that then they shouldn\u2019t be marrying someone that already has a kid. OP has not once said they\u2019re ungrateful for all their stepfather may have done, but no one could ever replace her father that she knew for 7 years.  She met this guy literally 5 years ago, when she was already an adolescent. The expectation that she accept him as \u201cdad\u201d is utterly ridiculous, and the fact that mom and stepdad keep pushing it so much has probably hindered any bonding OP could have had with her new father figure.", "It\u2019s a big ask. Asking someone (a kid, in this case) to dismiss their grief before they\u2019re ready, asking someone to forego their own discomfort to appease a grownup\u2019s ego or feelings is a big ask. It\u2019s not enough that OP respects and cares for the stepdad? Not enough for the adult. The adult needs to adult and get over it.", "You don't get to tell people who others are to them. If she doesn't see him as her father, what he's done for her is irrelevant, because you can't force an emotional connection with people by doing things for them. That's not how any of that works. And if thats why someone is doing it, it's transactional and manipulative. \n\n>She has  two fathers. She's being very unfair to one of them.\n\nNo, she has one father and a stepfather. That's how she sees them, and that's what they are to her. Whether its fair or not is also irrelevant, you aren't required to fake your feelings to be fair. And it's hugely unfair to ask someone to do so. To \"pretend they love you\" for your own ego and feelings. Thats not loving. That's emotionally manipulative. \n\n>It's a very small ask, that she acknowledge the role her second dad took on voluntarily and dedicated himself to\n\nIt's a huge ask, coz she was never given a choice in that role. And she's said no *multiple times*. Pushing her on it and pressuring her is unfair. And will only lead to her resenting her mother and stepfather even more, and probably not having much of a relationship with either when she can move out and live on her own. \n\n>Love and respect are not finite. Loving your second dad in no way replaces the love and honor and grief you have for your first dad.\n\nBut she doesn't love him as a father.

I'm so blessed to have all those people care for me.\n\nI'm very happy for you, but your choices are your own. You don't get to say everyone should be like this because it's how it is for you.

People who put in the time, effort, and understanding are family. However, I've had family who put in the time, effort, but never understood me (uncles and aunts mostly,) and when I became an adult, I stopped the association (except at big family events), because they never felt like my family. \nThey felt like people I was forced to be around as a child due to their connection with my parents. \nAgain, you can't tell people what to feel for others, and you can't force connection or family. \nShe gets to decide who she considers her father or family and it's not the man her mother married.", "I obviously didn't mean for her to use those exact words. That I used colorful language in conveying my judgment, disdain, and reading of the situation doesn't negate anything I said.", "Have you tried pitching family therapy to them?

Yuck. You were 100% right and your mother should be holding Mark to a *higher* standard than you because he has always been an adult since you have known each other, whereas you were a child when you met. You lost somebody important in this situation, he didn't. He never knew your father so can't value him, whereas you knew him and value him very much.

Maybe show her this thread after more folks comment on it. You should never EVER be guilted into something like that. I\u2019m sorry.", "My thoughts exactly. This take is so dismissive of the OP.", "She was 12 when he became step-dad, if I read correctly, so very likely, he did very little of that.", "You were pretty damn judgmental of a mom who waited 5 years to get into a new relationship and has been married to what seems to be an ok guy for another five years. \n\nEven if we assume OP is not being biased at all and this is a perfectly accurate story of things, take shots at how someone has treated their daughter. Don't make moral judgments on how someone moved on from the traumatic death of their husband 10 years ago.", "You obviously didn't mean those words to be said to the mother.  I am sorry you don't realise you negate your words yourself.", "Yeah, they decided that it's an unhealthy way for me to be. That it's me denying myself a loving relationship because I lost my dad. To them it's something that should be worked through. They ignore the fact I have formed loving relationships since my dad died. Their hang up is that one of them wasn't with Mark.", "And I say this as a mother who's husband is not my 6 year olds bio dad, but she calls him daddy. But that relationship formed ORGANICALLY without pressure and we were already in therapy to cope with the damage my abusive ex husband left us with. I was worried things were progressing too fast, but my kids therapist told me as long as neither hubby or I was pushing anything that it was a healthy progression. She'd fight you if you told her my husband wasn't her dad. \n\nNo. My child's bio dad is not dead. But she remembers him, she remembers him forcing her to say I wasn't her real mom and his girlfriend was her new mommy, she remembers that she was forced to sleep on the floor while the girlfriends kids got beds.  Do you know how much damage that did to my kid?! She's almost 7. It's been almost 4 years. She was 3-3.5 when all this was going on. Forcing a parental relationship is NOT okay. It's not a relationship that can be forced. All you build is resentment.  I'm fully of the mind that the more people who love my kid the better, but love is not bending someone to your will for appearances and vanity.", "I'm judgmental of a mom who puts the feelings of her new dick above the kid she's had for longer and also has a dead dad. New dick doesn't have any baggage, that's why it's sexy.", ">You were pretty damn judgmental of a mom who waited 5 years to get into a new relationship and has been married to what seems to be an ok guy for another five years.\n\nOPs mom isnt going to marry you bud so calm down and move on from this.", "Mom lost any claim of virtue when she tried to erase her dead husband.", "There is a difference between the specific words being used to convey a message, and the spirit of the message itself.", "It's really unkind of them and - dare I say it? - unhealthy of them to focus on your feelings in this way. Pestering you is so obviously counter productive. Stay strong OP, you're in the right.", "It's unhealthy for them to disrespect your personal, emotional, and relational boundaries by trying to force you to have a specific relationship with Mark. It's also rather immature and manipulative, honestly; I would expect adults to have a better understanding of the fact that relationships are kind of finicky, unpredictable things. Either you click in a certain way or you don't. Either you feel something for them or you don't. Every connection is unique, and a genuine connection cannot be forged by arbitrarily changing how you refer to someone. \n\nIn a way, I feel like you're being treated like an accessory, rather than a person - as if your relationship with Mark (as evidenced by calling him Dad) is your mom's proof that her marriage to him is perfect and wonderful and happy. You have to fall in line and love Mark just as much as she does, or else her little dream life is broken. The idea that you might be lukewarm about the guy and not feel any particularly special connection to him violates whatever fantasy life she hoped to have when she married him.
