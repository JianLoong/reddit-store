He was on his way to work and got into an accident. I loved my dad and have missed him so much since he died. Mom and I both went into grief therapy after his death. She went for about 6 months. I went for almost 3 years.\n\nA few months before I stopped attending therapy my mom met \"Mark\". I didn't meet him for like a year and a bit after but mom told me she was dating someone and then when they became boyfriend and girlfriend. They got married like 7 months after I met him. I was 12.\n\nEven before they got married Mark and my mom would call me their daughter and say I was their kid. He would tell people I was his daughter when he met them. Whereas I always called him my mom's husband or fianc\u00e9 before they got married.\n\nIt bothers my mom and Mark that I don't tell people he's my dad or say \"my parents\" when I'm talking about both. \n\nOver the years they have told me it would mean a lot to Mark if I were to introduce him as my dad. Or she said I could say bonus dad, but not stepdad, since that sounds far more insignificant in terms of the role he plays in my life.\n\nI have never done this. But for a couple of years now my mom has told me I should be better than this, I should think about someone else's feelings above my own. That it would cost me nothing to let people see him as my parent instead of instantly delegating him to just the dude she's married to. She has gone on and on about thinking about his feelings and not putting my own first the whole time.\n\nLately it has been getting to me so when mom said it to me (17f) a couple of weeks ago I told her she should try holding her husband to the same standard she holds me to and ask him to put my feelings on this before his own. \n\nMy mom told me he already has to do that day after day when I refuse to acknowledge him as a dad in my life. I told her he had a choice on whether he wanted to marry her and take me on. I never got a choice in his place in my life. But I told her I am taking back that right to choose what he is to me whether she likes it or not.\n\nShe told me it was petty for me to claim he needs to be held to the same standard when his actions don't hurt me but mine hurt him.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1703057998, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18mp3a2/aita_for_telling_my_mom_she_should_hold_her/", "score": 2777, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your feelings might have been different had he filled the fatherly role in a way that made you want to call him \"Dad\", but even then, your sense of connection to your actual dad may preclude you ever wanting to refer to anyone else that way. They should respect this.", "When I married my wife, she already had children. Their dad was still in the picture, but pretty useless as a father/role model. I never insisted the kids called me anything but what they wanted to. They referred to me as Mums husband for a bit, then stepdad for a while, and by my name as they got older.\nWhen the eldest had her first little one, she passed me her baby, and said \"meet your grandad\".\nI don't care what my kids call me, they know I am family.", "You suffered a traumatic loss at a young age, and whatever you choose to call Mark should be up to you, not them. I understand it would be difficult to refer to Mark as \u201cmy dad\u201d because you feel like you would be dishonoring the memory of the dad you lost. \n\nPerhaps you could try to find a calm moment and discuss this with both of them, saying something that both acknowledged their feelings and Mark\u2019s role in your lives while also protecting your wishes, like \u201cMark, I am grateful to have you in our lives and appreciate everything you have done for me, but I had a person in my life that called \u2018Dad,\u2019 and it doesn\u2019t feel right to me or my memory of him to call anyone else that. I hope you understand this isn\u2019t meant to hurt or disrespect either of you in any way.  It\u2019s just how I feel.\u201d Or whatever works for your particular situation.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Everything you said was true. You didn't choose him. She did. You aren't obligated to like or even tolerate the choices she makes in her life, let alone play along their little game of fantasy-charades. In reality, he *isn't* your dad. The fact that she's trying to force you to think of him as a \"replacement\" is fucked-up enough without adding the other stuff into it. Honestly, you're very strong-willed for holding true about this, even if it comes from a dark place of hurt and trauma. Even still, it should be respected.\n\nIf it comes up again, you should ask your mother why she consistently places her new dick over her only daughter. You're the only living memory of her dead husband. If she values his memory so little that she actively tramples the will of his only legacy, it's no wonder she took only 6 months to get over what took you 3 years.\n\nHonestly, it just sounds like she doesn't value you as much as she values her new guy friend.", "NTA. You had a father. You have memories about him. Your mother chose Mark, you didn't. He is your stepdad, you can love him very much BUT you have no obligations to consider him as your dad. \n\nYour mother is insecure in her relationship. If she was clear with her new husband, she could face the fact you don't call him \"daddy\". IT's great that he wants to be a father for you but he never asked you first, he just  acted like so, even if he met you at 12. It can't work that way, you're not a dog that had change of owner. You lost your dad. You loved him. And I think a psychologist would say the \"forcing\" from Mark and your mother makes you feel they try to erase your dad's memory. So the more they try to force you to say \"dad\" to Mark, the less you'll do it. \n\nThese things must come naturally. Mayve it's too late because you met him when you were a teenager, you were constructing yourself from childhood from adulthood, this strange period everything is difficult, different, and sometimes sad. And they didn't permit you to express your own desire, feelings. \n\nDon't feel guilty. Mark is your mother husband, they chose each other, and you have the right to keep a distance with Mark, even if he pays bill, it doesn't make him a father for you.", "NTA\n\nMy second husband is my daughter's stepdad for 8 years now. She still calls him stepdad or by his first name. Sometimes she called him dad, and then corrected herself.\n\nHe said it's her choice, but his heart did melt when she called her dad every single time.\n\nMy first husband and I are still very good friends. We see each other at every family function, every holiday. He was always open to spending time with his daughter, and I always made sure she gets as much time as possible with him when she wanted to.\n\nNow that her half brother is born, my second husband is his dad. My daughter and I talked about if she wants to call him dad now. She said she doesn't want to confuse the two in her head. Only one dad allowed apparently.\n\nWe talked about maybe calling him Papi instead of Papa (German for Daddy instead of Dad), and she tried it a couple of days and then decided against it.\n\nWhen talking to her brother, she would refer to her stepdad as dad, but never when talking about herself.\n\nAnd you know what? That's fine.\n\nSame as her keeping my old last name (my first husband took mine), to share her last name with her dad.\n\nWe talked about it. She made the decision without any pressure. She's 12 now, and she's perfectly fine telling her stepdad she loves him. She does. And he loves her.\n\nHe's a wonderful stepdad in her eyes. The best she can wish for. He's just not her dad.\n\nTrying to force you was wrong. It killed any chance the two of them ever had in making you pick that title for him yourself. You had to push back against them, against them stomping your feelings.\n\nThey put you between a rock and a hard place to begin with. Your reasoning is clear.\n\nBy pushing over the boundary again and again, your mother will slowly alienate you.\n\nI'm sorry, by the way. You deserved better.", "NTA\u2026they need to drop it.  What a strange thing for them to bring up regularly\u2026.especially when they see that it harms you.", "\u201cMy mom has told me I should be better than this, I should think about someone else\u2019s feelings above my own.\u201d\n\nYeah, mom should definitely take her own advice here. The adults are the ones refusing to consider the feelings of the actual child.\n\nYou are spot on. Sorry you\u2019re dealing with this, OP.\n\nNTA", "I am a stepmother and would never ever EVER try to force my stepdaughters to call me a certain thing. And the thought of asking them to is pretty weird to me. They can call me whatever they feel like and if they called me mom knowing they didn\u2019t want to I would feel terrible and sad. That would almost feel worse than anything I could think of them calling me.", "NTA. My mother remarried twice. Both to really good men. I called the first husband dad when I was 12, but stopped once they divorced. However I still keep in touch with him. Mum remarried about 8 years ago and he a really good husband to my mother. However he will never be my dad. \n\nFor the record, I do have trouble calling my bio father dad. That's another story.", "Uhhh it seems like his actions do hurt you tho? Is your mom blind? NTA", "NTA. You were absolutely right in what you said. Your mother is out of line for what she said and should probably head back to therapy.", "NTA. It\u2019s his job to be the adult, and he is not your bio dad. I still don\u2019t call my stepdad \u201cdad\u201d or any variant but I love him just as much as my bio dad (I did change him in my phone to be listed as dad though, he doesn\u2019t know. It\u2019s just too weird to suddenly switch from \u201cfirst name\u201d to \u201cdad\u201d after 30 years) \nIf he loves you unconditionally, he will keep loving you unconditionally. Sometimes kids hurt their parents, but if he keeps loving you then one day you may feel a closer bond and trust from having him respect your autonomy and not pressuring you! It will also mean far more to him in the distant future if you guys are able to forge that closer bond that\u2019s earned from true respect.", "I just don\u2019t get these parents/step-parents who push this kind of thing. My dad is step-dad to my sister. He became part of her life when she was 9 and for all intents-and-purposes raised her. She asked him rather than her bio dad to walk her down the aisle, etc. But she has always called him her step-dad (and by his first name) and that has never meant he means less to her. Equally I have a friend who calls his step-dad \u201cdad\u201d and was formally adopted by him, etc. both of these are full and meaningful relationships for the people in them, even if one doesn\u2019t have the \u201cHallmark movie\u201d traits that people are so attracted to.", "Right off the bat, NTA.\n\n>Even before they got married Mark and my mom would call me their daughter and say I was their kid. He would tell people I was his daughter when he met them. Whereas I always called him my mom's husband or fianc\u00e9 before they got married.\n\nThat's where Mark and your mother failed. As much as Mark wanted to play a fatherly role, he went the wrong way and made the wrong call. Having read plenty of posts coming from stepchildren having gone through a similar situation, forcing the stepchild to accept the stepparent as the parent has never left to happy resolutions. What I have seen is that those who \"show, don't tell\", that is, those that respect the child and follow the child's lead when it comes to parental needs and are there unconditionally, including while NOT being called parent, have the best outcomes. Unfortunately, you did not get that, quite the opposite actually. It comes off as trying to erase the father you lost at 7 yo, which is totally AH behavior.\n\n>It bothers my mom and Mark that I don't tell people he's my dad or say \"my parents\" when I'm talking about both. \n\nToo bad for them; that's how things are and they made sure by how they acted that it would stay that way.\n\nAgain, NTA.", "But\u2026 his actions DOES hurt you? By erasing your dad? NTA obviously", "You're being nicer than I would be, to both of them to shut the fuck up.\n\nYou already know you're NTA", "NTA.

It\u2019s like saying \u201cpretend to love me!\u201d", "NTA", "They got married when you were 12, thats only 5 years (ish) that he has been in your life. Why in the world would you call him dad after this long when you had your real father aroubd for 7 years? Mark can be a 'father figure' but there is no need to pressure you to call him anything else apart from his actual name", "Honestly, what a mature response!  Asking your mom and (for lack of a better description) stepparent to consider your feelings isn't a big ask.  Any parent should not only be able to understand this, but do this.  \n\nNTA", "NTA and wannabe \u201cdad\u201d needs to quit thinking of himself. He is a stepfather. It is what it is.", "NTA. Your mother is ignoring the fact that it sounds like his actions did/do hurt you.

Can't have been easy losing him and then later not being given a say in how you address your mom's new love.", "NTA.  \n\n\nThe sad thing about this is, if people like your mom and step dad stay back and allow the relationship to develop naturally, they could possibly become a very special parent figure, possibly even with their own parental name.  \"Pop\" instead of \"dad\" or the like.   \n\n\nThe fact that these people make it all about themselves and their feelings is, imho, the biggest problem here.  \n\n\nThese folks: \"but I WANT to be called 'dad/mom' it hurts my feelings...\"\n\nAny normal adult should be able to see that it's not about them and that it's just so darned selfish to push the issue and ...frankly, walk all over someone else's right to their own choices.", "NTA\n\nShe should quit being selfish and expecting you to play happy doll family for her public image.

She is the one who is absolutely in the wrong.", "NTA. Your feelings should matter. But why is your mother acting as the gatekeeper between you and your stepdad? \n\nThat is most decidedly not her place. If you were abusing him, or vice versa, she\u2019d have standing to protect you from each other. But that isn\u2019t the case here. She believes that he is hurt. You are hurt that she disregards her feelings. Both sides of that issue belong to you and her husband, not to her. \n\nNext time she brings this up, and you know she will, tell her that you want to have a conversation about this with HIM.

Maybe have a chat to them and see if they can talk some sense into your mum. \n\nOr ask your mum how she would feel if she had been the one to die and your dad had remarried and expected you to accept his new wife as mum and totally erase her memory from your mind.

If your mum and stepdad hadn't been so obsessed with playing happy families then that natural connection very well may have grown over time, but instead they've pushed their feelings on to you and in turn, naturally, resentment has bloomed. \n\nBoundaries are so important, and it's something that parents should educate their children on from a young age, that and no is a full sentence. You are not at fault, you had your dad and lost him in a tragic accident, nobody will ever replace him and your mum needs to realise that.\n\n(I also wonder if she never truly healed from the loss of your dad, only six months in therapy really feels like surface level rather than dealing with trauma.)", "NTA\n\nTell your mom you would like to start family therapy. A therapist may be able to (slowly) get through to both your mom and stepdad that it's not your job to validate stepdad. It's their job to nurture, care for, and protect you. You need to treat each of them with respect and civility, but you don't owe them honors or specific emotions that validate them. (I say this as a mom of teens.) The therapist may help them understand that - if stepdad could just meet you where you are at and allow the relationship you are comfortable with having with him build naturally - that relationship will be the best one he could possibly have.\n\nIf there are any other adults in your life that can help you talk with them, that might be another avenue. If you can't get through to them, just treat them with as much respect and civility as you can (hard, I know, given that you are going through the teen years AND they are not respecting you, your feelings or your autonomy).

It very well may be that he became your \u2018practicing father\u2019 and maybe he has legitimate reasons to feel that way. But the dead of a parent is heavy especially at that age. You can\u2019t really replace a parent with an another one after a loss like this. \n\nThe whole meaning of what my dad was, what he means to me changed considerably over the years after his passing.

Our life flashes through our eyes. Why? Because we get to look upon all our fond memories and feel the fear of the loss our disappearance from our loved ones lives have upon them. I say this, because if I passed on and left a daughter behind? I would hope my significant other would eventually move on and find a man that would be able to provide my child what I always lacked. A father. Mind you, my real father did very horrible things to my sister and I. My mother disappeared from our lives quickly. But my grandparents managed to finally get custody of us. It took a while for me to warm up to my grandfather [not related by blood.] But I eventually started calling him dad. He passed away 12 years later when I was 15 and I think about him every day. What I could have done, things I could have said when he was abruptly taken away by the big C. My real father meant nothing to me. My grandfather is the one I call dad. Still to this day I call him dad. But my grandmother [whom I call mom. Even though my real mother is in my life now. I call out mom, both respond. Lol] dated around for a while until she got remarried a a few years later. It took me a couple of years to warm up to him too. But I started calling him dad. Why? I don't think my dad [my grandfather,] would mind at all. Because I like to believe in his fleeting moments he may have considered what would become of my sister and I on his departure. [Because mom made it clear she didn't know if she could raise us the rest of the way without him. She pulled through. Haha.] But she even eventually asked me to call her new husband dad too. Mind you, I was in my early twenties and I had trouble with it too. Felt like it was expected of me, but his kindness and humor wormed its way into my heart. I don't think dad would mind either. Any man who can step into a relationship like that? Especially to raise another mans child and hopefully one day maybe, be called dad too? It is just an endearing title. They know they're not your dad. But it takes a man who everyone should respect wanting that role. Because if he is at least trying to fill that role, hoping one day to hear it from you? He's at least respectful. Although, they should have let you come to the decision yourself. But maybe after all these years? He might have started to think he was inadequate, maybe not living up to the standards of love your own father gave you. I don't think my father would mind, nor do I think yours would either.

Does he treat you well? Does he do dad things with you? For you? Is he good to your mom? Does he ever make you feel less than? Or throw it in your face that you aren\u2019t his by blood? These questions would make a difference to me. You shouldn\u2019t be pressured into calling him something you aren\u2019t comfortable with. Maybe go out to lunch with him just the two of you, tell him how you feel and why you feel those things. He may just not understand. Your mom may be pressuring it, who knows. But you should talk to him about it. See what happens and go from there. If you can answer all of those questions above positively wouldn\u2019t your dad be thankful for him? Wouldn\u2019t your dad be happy he is good to you two and not a horrible man that causes you hurt? Your dad isn\u2019t up there upset at the thought of you calling another man dad.

He was on his way to work and got into an accident. I loved my dad and have missed him so much since he died. Mom and I both went into grief therapy after his death. She went for about 6 months. I went for almost 3 years.\n\nA few months before I stopped attending therapy my mom met \"Mark\". I didn't meet him for like a year and a bit after but mom told me she was dating someone and then when they became boyfriend and girlfriend. They got married like 7 months after I met him. I was 12.\n\nEven before they got married Mark and my mom would call me their daughter and say I was their kid. He would tell people I was his daughter when he met them. Whereas I always called him my mom's husband or fianc\u00e9 before they got married.\n\nIt bothers my mom and Mark that I don't tell people he's my dad or say \"my parents\" when I'm talking about both. \n\nOver the years they have told me it would mean a lot to Mark if I were to introduce him as my dad. Or she said I could say bonus dad, but not stepdad, since that sounds far more insignificant in terms of the role he plays in my life.\n\nI have never done this. But for a couple of years now my mom has told me I should be better than this, I should think about someone else's feelings above my own. That it would cost me nothing to let people see him as my parent instead of instantly delegating him to just the dude she's married to. She has gone on and on about thinking about his feelings and not putting my own first the whole time.\n\nLately it has been getting to me so when mom said it to me (17f) a couple of weeks ago I told her she should try holding her husband to the same standard she holds me to and ask him to put my feelings on this before his own. \n\nMy mom told me he already has to do that day after day when I refuse to acknowledge him as a dad in my life. I told her he had a choice on whether he wanted to marry her and take me on. I never got a choice in his place in my life. But I told her I am taking back that right to choose what he is to me whether she likes it or not.\n\nShe told me it was petty for me to claim he needs to be held to the same standard when his actions don't hurt me but mine hurt him.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If he had been more respectful and less intrusive when you were young; if they had taken their relationship at a normal pace and given you time to acclimatise pre marriage; if she had actually defended your space and your right to progress your relationship with him at your own pace - *then* you would have learned to trust him and might have started feeling like he was a bonus dad to you, even if never a replacement. Step-parents forcing the relationship and stomping the child\u2019s feelings is what blocks this sort of bonding.\n\nHell, tell them that the first thing they need to do to build that relationship is make up for that pressure - which means they walk it back, they apologise, and they don\u2019t pressure you about it or talk at you about it for *at minimum* as long as they have been pressuring you.

And, in my opinion, you are right: you have a father. He didn't stop being your father when he died, as you didn't stop being his daughter. Love and bonding don't work like that. That bond will never cease to exist. Mark might be a perfect husband to your mother or a great provider (his choice, btw). None of that matters in this case, because you shouldn't be forced to go against something so meaningful to you out of gratitude. Forced gratitude.

I know it's totally possible that you asked to stop going, or that there was a \"team meeting\" of you, mom, and doctor to discuss the continued need for treatment or lack thereof... but the timing and the current situation really makes me wonder if your mom met Mark and decided you didn't need help with your grief anymore because she \"found a new daddy\" for you. Which is super gross and I sincerely hope that is not the case. \n\nI would encourage you to visit your schools social worker and see if they can call a meeting and help facilitate a healthy conversation. (If you go to public school in the states, your school should have at least 1 social worker. If you don't know how to access them, go to a trusted teacher, counselor, or the main office and ask where their office is/for their email address.) Talk to them first and decide what you want to say, if you want mom to come meet alone or if you want Mark there too. \n\nRemember that boundaries are for you; what you are and aren't willing to do for the sake of your safety and health. \"I will not call Mark 'dad'.\" = boundary. \"Call Mark 'dad' from now on\" =/= not a boundary. \n\nBest of luck to you \ud83d\udc9c", "NTA\n\nJust recently I was talking with a teenager (Kyle) about your age, he calls her mother long term partner by his name (not even step dad and we wil call him Mark) even though he was 6 when they got together and pretty much has been the only father figure he ever had .\n\n\n I asked Kyle why he keeps Mark at arms length if he's been all this time raising him, taking care of him, etc. The answer me gave me made my heart ache, although Mark never mistreated him, he was just a tad too controlling during his early teens, and more importantly he never shown signs of appreciation of Kyle's achievements (in 13 years!)

Shaming her for finding a new partner or for caring about that partner's feelings, even if very poorly carried out, is just in bad taste.", "they kind of don't. ops step father is the exact kind of person who should have never become a step parent, and her mother should have never remarried. they have consistently disrespected ops feelings on this matter. she is not required to see him as anything more than her moms husband and they're constant pushing is a major catalyst as to why that's all she'll ever see him as", "ignore them. they're talking out their ass about things they know nothing about."]}
