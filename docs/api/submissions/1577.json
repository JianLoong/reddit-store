I would do exactly the same thing if it was my kids too. Hopefully, thus little run-in might deter that girl from.l doing something like that ever again...", "NTA human beings don\u2019t learn unless we face consequences, and childhood is THE time to learn. It takes a village, and you were just being a helpful part of her village that day. Better she learns now when her punishment is a timeout and not in ten years when she\u2019d face jail time.", "NTA and thank you from another mom!", "Good job.", "NTA you did the right thing. The kid is learning a valuable lesson and so are your kids. Actions have consequences.", "NTA you taught your kids the correct way to handle a situation, talk to someone in power about the wrong (theft), use the security footage to prove what happened, and then move on with your life.\n\nyou also taught the thieves that they shouldn't steal, and there are consequences to actions. or just not to do it where there's video evidence, either way they got a lesson too.", "NTA. Good life lesson.", "NTA\n\nBut I would be surprised if the park doesn't ban her for a while, the liability for them could be bad if not just the optics.", "NTA She needs to learn that theft is not okay and has consequences. Like you said before she graduates to worse offences.", "the only part of this that might make you an asshole is calling a 10-year-old chubby when it adds absolutely no context to the story, simply put in there to be cruel. figuring out where that came from is something to think about. but as far as them being asked to leave?

It's not fun making children cry but she got what she deserved and it will serve her a lesson for the future.

Kids need to learn that there are consequences for their behavior,  and the sooner the better.", "NTA . If my kids stole I absolutely would tear them a new one . That being said not only did the girl steal from them , she tried to lie , and only started crying when she realized she got caught by cameras . There was literal proof.", "NTA\n\nYou didn't get a child in trouble or make her cry. \n\nShe behaved poorly and got caught. \n\nExcellent role modeling for your kids.
