I would do exactly the same thing if it was my kids too. Hopefully, thus little run-in might deter that girl from.l doing something like that ever again...", "NTA human beings don\u2019t learn unless we face consequences, and childhood is THE time to learn. It takes a village, and you were just being a helpful part of her village that day. Better she learns now when her punishment is a timeout and not in ten years when she\u2019d face jail time.", "NTA and thank you from another mom!", "Good job.", "NTA you did the right thing. The kid is learning a valuable lesson and so are your kids. Actions have consequences.", "NTA you taught your kids the correct way to handle a situation, talk to someone in power about the wrong (theft), use the security footage to prove what happened, and then move on with your life.\n\nyou also taught the thieves that they shouldn't steal, and there are consequences to actions. or just not to do it where there's video evidence, either way they got a lesson too.", "NTA. Good life lesson.", "NTA\n\nBut I would be surprised if the park doesn't ban her for a while, the liability for them could be bad if not just the optics.", "NTA She needs to learn that theft is not okay and has consequences. Like you said before she graduates to worse offences.", "the only part of this that might make you an asshole is calling a 10-year-old chubby when it adds absolutely no context to the story, simply put in there to be cruel. figuring out where that came from is something to think about. but as far as them being asked to leave? NTA", "NTA\n\nIt wasn't your intention on making her cry. The kid needed consequences and she got them.", "NTA. It's not fun making children cry but she got what she deserved and it will serve her a lesson for the future. Sometimes tears are the best way to learn from a situation.", "NTA - that bully, thief needed those consequences for her actions.", "You're NTA. Kids need to learn that there are consequences for their behavior,  and the sooner the better.", "NTA . If my kids stole I absolutely would tear them a new one . That being said not only did the girl steal from them , she tried to lie , and only started crying when she realized she got caught by cameras . There was literal proof.", "NTA\n\nYou didn't get a child in trouble or make her cry. \n\nShe behaved poorly and got caught. \n\nExcellent role modeling for your kids. They'll stand up for themselves and know that you mean business.", "I edited it. It was just to show that my kids did have a description and didn\u2019t point at some random kid or something. But I\u2019m sorry.", "Again I apologize for that my daughter gave that exact description and than pointed to the kid and said there she was. My daughter was told \u201cchubby\u201d wasn\u2019t nice, but I wanted everyone here to know my daughter was sure about who it was, and that my kids didn\u2019t point out a random child to blame.", "I changed it and sorry it was just to show my kiddos had a description.", "Sorry my daughter said that, and I corrected her. Just said it so no one thought my child pointed out a random kiddo. She had a description", "Now it was just crying, she needs consequences or in the future she will steal and end in jail", "Ugh. People are so sensitive. Good grief. NTA btw", "[deleted]", "[deleted]", "....it was relevant for your kid describing this person. How is it a bad thing? Only reason people are nitpicking on you is because it added absolutely nothing to your written version.", "You could edit your post to take it out.", "I just did explain. Now, how do I edit the post?", "I didn\u2019t call her that I gave the description my kids gave, than one saw her and said there she is.

It probably cost 2 dollars . My mom brought me all the way back and made me apologize to a random cashier and give it back. I\u2019m now almost 35 and I still haven\u2019t stolen anything since because that stuck w me. Having said that, I\u2019ve had many girlfriends though who seem to love to steal from Walmart or Target lol \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "NTA fuck that kid", "NTA\n\nKids need to get in trouble and deal with the consequences of their actions. Hopefully she'll learn her lesson now and immediately change her ways, so she doesn't end up trying to steal cars and be sent to juvie in four years.", "NTA. Reporting theft is never wrong, nor is protecting your kids.\n\nPlus there\u2019s about a 50/50 chance that getting caught (on camera no less) and exposed so publicly will get it through her head that she did wrong, or that she was crying crocodile tears to get out of trouble by putting on an act.", "NTA, she just learned a big lesson and she definitely needed to learn it. stealing and bullying has consequences", "NTA Maybe the child will learn a lesson from this which is the most important thing.", "I h\u00e2te people thinking that they have no right to step in when someone else\u2019s child is hurting people. Kids aren\u2019t private property- she\u2019s in public and her actions had negative consequences on the people around her. It\u2019s not *just* her mother\u2019s responsibility to decide to punish her- or not. Would her mother have ensured that the manager knew your kids didn\u2019t get to play? Would her mother have taken her home? Would her mother have reimbursed you? Perhaps not. You had every right to make sure that proper actions were taken. NTA.", "She's crying because she got caught and she thinks that it will minimize the punishment she deserves.\n\nNTA", "Nope! NTA. You did the right thing. Hopefully it made a real impression and the girl and her friends think twice before doing something like this again.", "NTA and I hope that the mother punished her, and got the kid some therapy.", "NTA, this was a lesson moment. That child is receiving consequences for their actions. Hopefully the kid will take in the lesson properly and won't be doing that shit again", "Why are you even asking? Someone stole from your children, money. They either bullied or physically took it either way you look at it your kids were assaulted. Nta", "Nta", "NTA! You\u2019ll probably do her a favor in the long run. She should learn consequences sooner rather than later.", "NTA\n\nDon\u2019t feel guilty at all. She\u2019s a complete asshole and liar and her mom hopefully punishes her appropriately", "NTA. You didn\u2019t make her cry. The consequences of her actions made her cry", "NTA. I\u2019m a high school teacher, and you can tell which kids have parents who have never held them accountable and act as if their child can do no wrong (when that is very clearly not the case.) You did that kid a favor.", "NTA", "LMAO I love that she got caught in her lie and don\u2019t feel sorry for her embarrassment. She deserves every ounce. I hope she learns from this before she steals something that\u2019ll give her more than a slap on the wrist. NTA", "NTA Why the hell is this even a question? You have potentially done that girl a favour by correcting behaviour that will make her life hard.", "I know I\u2019m the only one here, but soft YTA, in my opinion as someone that studies youth crime. Yes you should always stand up for your kids, and children need to face consequences, but I don\u2019t know if reprimanding a kid in public to the point of crying was necessary when the worker was already dealing with it", "This right here, you are not only helpful in making sure your kids know that they can come to you for help, and for that child that there are consequences to bad behavior.", "Yeah this is it really. You did not get the kid in trouble, the kid did something wrong and got called out for it which was them getting themself in trouble, and she cried because she got caught.", "For me I was 4 and it was a quarter Reese\u2019s cup. I forgot about it and it melted in my pocket. I had to get the money out of my piggy bank, go back to the 7/11 and apologize to the cashier. Never stole anything else.\n\nNTA OP. Her mom should\u2019ve been on her, as soon as she had evidence that her daughter was guilty.", "So because a kid who stole cried when called out, Op is a 'soft' asshole? \nWow who knew. Will take my young daughter to steal now and when someone calls her out, I will just tell her to turn on the water works and make the other person an asshole \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44", "The kid cried due to her actions having consequences. The OP wasn't screaming at the kid until the kid cried. Wtf. The kid was embarrassed she was caught and got into trouble and that's why she cried.", "NTA!!  Thieves and bullies come in all shapes and sizes. You are not the one who made her cry. Her guilt made her cry. Realizing that she was not going to get away with her actions made her cry.\n\nYou did the right thing and making sure it was properly reported. Hopefully she will learn and become a better person for it.", "People are being too sensitive about this detail, you would just pointing out that you had an clear description. It's not a bad thing to point out people's size cuz it's not a judgment, it's just a description", "I agree but I don\u2019t think it was guilt I think she was embarrassed to be caught in her obvious lie."]}
