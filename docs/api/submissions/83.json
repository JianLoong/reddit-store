She was especially mean on family events where everyone could hear her displeasures with us (mostly me). She isn\u2019t deliberately mean but the questions \u2018what are you waiting for\u2019 and \u2018why do you even care about career\u2019 are getting old and they make me sad especially because for about a year now I really want a baby. We could easily have kids, I am ready and we\u2019ve been together since we were kids ourselves. But there is still time and I don't want to push my fianc\u00e9 into it. \n\nOne day (about 6 months ago when we weren't engaged yet) I had enough and told her we are trying but nothing sticks. I wasn't really thinking. She stopped pushing me and asking me about it and I can see it in her eyes she loves me a lot more now that we are fake trying. My fiance finds it funny and clever. But we both feel I kind of F up since this could bring some bad luck.\n\nWe decided to stop using protection after or a bit before the wedding (she doesn't know we are engaged yet) so there is that. And lately she is asking more and more about our fake struggles. She is so very nice to me now and she even told me about her struggles with conceiving. And here is where I think I am the asshole. I bonded with my mother in law over stuff that are very painful. It's obvious she still has trauma from the past. Now I will have to lie to her till the day I die. It\u2019s not like I am making stuff up\u2026 I am just listening and claiming we will not be looking for treatment yet and I am not ready to talk about it or listen to advice. I am basically stalling. \n\nI asked a few people and they all agree I should not tell her. Especially my fianc\u00e9 who likes that we are close now. I decided I will not tell her and if she asks I will just say I don't want to talk about it. And hopefully I didn't bring so much bad luck we will actually have trouble conceiving.

Rinse, lather repeat until she finally stops asking or you get pregnant.", "I...I guess? ESH?\n\n\nI mean, she shouldnt be so aggressive and loudly proclaiming her displeasure over the lack of grandkids from you. That makes her an asshole. But.... its not really the initial lie to make her back off that makes you an asshole. Its more of the trauma bonding when youve never actually gone through what she has. Thats....thats kinda super messed up. I get that it wasnt your initial intention with the lie but....now if you dont take this to your grave, and your fianc\u00e9 doesnt take this to his grave, can you even imagine how your MIL will feel? How...violated? I mean, she only opened up to you with her struggles because she thought you were going through a similar thing. That would like. Shatter me.

You don't have to tell her what the trouble was.", "Lol nope.\nNone of her business. \nIf it gets her off your back AND incidentally makes her a more empathertic person then that's a win in my book. \nYou owe her no say in your obstetric or mental health.", "NTA but your fiance should be the one handling this, especially if he's the one who's not ready for kids yet", "NTA, you found a way to bring peace to your relationship with her.
