They usually take the bus, but sometimes I will drive them before work. As I was driving, I heard a loud fart coming from my son's friend, followed by laughter from both of them. Apparently he is doing it at least partly on purpose, because they have a dumb \"farting joke\" they think is funny. He even pulled his legs up before he farted to demonstrate he was doing it on purpose.\n\nI told them point blank this was not funny at all and asked my son's friend to not do that again in my car. Few minutes later, he farted again and busted out laughing. My son had a smirk on his face but was trying to hold back his laughter because he knows I asked him not to. At this point I pulled over to the nearest bus stop (we live in Europe so we have great public transport), and told my son's friend he will have to travel the rest of the distance by bus.\n\nLater my son told me he was embarrassed in front of his friend and thinks I treated him a bit too harshly. Apparently the kid was also late for practice and the coach scolded him. So, AITA here?\n\n**EDIT:** Just to clear some things up - I didn't just leave the kid on the side of the road, I left him at the nearest bus stop to take the bus he usually takes to practice.

But not everyone finds deliberately blasting ass funny.\n\nTrue story. Im a flight dispatcher who used to commute (Lived in one state but flew out of state for work every week and came home on my days off)  I spent a lot of time in the flight deck jumpseat when there werent passenger seats available. I flying on company metal (one of our companies airplanes) one afternoon so I knew the pilots. \n\nTwo guys and Im a woman. Right after we took off, they started in on that crap. Their food from the night before was giving them a lot of ammunition. After the 3rd time of them doing it, I reached over and deployed the crew O2. Flight deck oxygen is different from passenger oxygen.  In the cabin, its little plastic masks that come down from a chemical oxygen generator that will produce oxygen for about 12 minutes...long enough for the pilots to get the airplane down below 14000'.  Flight deck oxygen comes from a pressurized tank, is delivered via a mask and smoke goggles that inflate and then deflate to conform to your face and head and can be donned with one hand, and provides continuous oxygen for all pilots and observers (typically 3-4 ) people for extended time and can be started and stopped. (Lot of different reasons that pilots might need to don oxygen in flight...its part of standard procedures.)\n\nYou are never faulted for using the crew O2 but if the bottle drops below a certain PSI, it has to be serviced. This one of the few basic maintenance items that CANNOT be performed when there are passengers on board so you cant board the next flight until its done. \n\nSo here I am with the mask on. At first they are laughing, taking photos of me. \"Haha Glass! We get it. Very funny. Now take it off.\"\n\nI refused.\n\n\"Seriously! We want to quick turn. Take it off.\"\n\nSo I picked up the QRH and turned to the procedure for \"smoke, fumes or unknown odors in the flight deck\"  First step: Don O2 Masks.\n\nThat was the hill I chose to die on that day.  As another poster said \"Fart around and find out.\"\n\nI eventually did take it off. But they still had to service it when they landed. No there was no danger to flight. No I did not get in trouble. lol\n\nFart jokes are only funny until they arent funny anymore.
