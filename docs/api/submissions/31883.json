They were both sly about it - didn't tell anyone they were going, turned off locations, and ignored texts until they were one day in.  \n\nMy friend had mentioned previously that he wouldn't be able to travel until his sentencing, because part of his release guidelines were that he has to call a number every morning to find out if he has to come in for random alcohol testing (because another condition of his pre-sentencing release was that he cannot have alcohol at all) - and that he has a three-hour window to make the call and report for testing.  The place they went was four hours away.  I thought it risky that he played the odds on not having to report, but his life.  \n\nI had a feeling, based on some of the social media posts and texts that he was sending into the trip, that alcohol was in play.

I also heard from others that he's been taking shots here and there when out in public (but he did deny that when I asked him about it).\n\nI told him that I still considered him a friend (and hoped he did too), but that I'd like him to take back the character letter.  I didn't feel I could stand behind the things I wrote anymore, and it's now my name in some file vouching for someone that's already broke conditions of his release.\n\nThe conversation did not go well.

They are the asshole for doing assholish things.\n\nIf this is how he's going to act, honestly I'd be calling the PO and asking to confirm that your letter has indeed been retracted.   When (not if) they ask why, you tell them why.  That you know he violated his parole and that you are no longer comfortable being a character witness for him.\n\nLet his parole officer come down on him.  He's an adult, he knew what he was doing, and his actions have consequences.  The sooner he learns this, the better.", "NTA however I doubt he took back that letter.  You have two options: Let it slide and realize that he will never be your friend because let\u2019s face it he is a shitty person.  The other is that you call the PO to confirm if the letter has been taken back but then you will have to explain why.  This will get him in legal trouble and he will know it was you.  He\u2019s already not your friend anymore anyway because he is ghosting you but you run the risk of him trying to take your shared friends away from you.  And anytime you hang out with shared friends he could be present too.  I don\u2019t know if that letter could be used against you in any future legal proceedings for instance if you are a witness or if you are in legal trouble and they want to dirty your character.  So I would call the PO because that letter could affect you in any future legal proceedings you are involved with.  Possibly even if you get divorced and custody is at stake.  I don\u2019t know if it could.  You could speak to a lawyer and ask.  I would.  Anyway this guy is no longer your friend.\n\nEdit:  Also, that mutual friend is a terrible friend.  To encourage drinking and a four hour away trip with him when he knew that he could be called in for a test at any moment.  Your friend continues to drink, he is in a deep downward spiral and might end up doing jail time.  Time to get away from him and encourage your other friends to not drink with him.", "NTA, you wrote it based on how you perceived him, and that was the point of it, to share with other concerned parties your honest opinion on his character. He has done things to change your opinion and perception of his character and qualities, thus invalidating your Character Letter as it is no longer an accurate representation of your feelings.\n\nHaving your name dragged through the mud to support the ones you care for is one thing, letting them drag your name through the mud so they may avoid suffering the consequences of their actions with intention of continuing the behaviour that got them in trouble to begin with is another thing and shows how mature that person really is.", "NTA\n\nYour friend has a serious disease and he won't get better until he accepts it and gets help. In the meantime, you are not obligated to enable his dysfunctional behaviors. You did the right thing, anything else is called enabling.", "NTA but you need to contact the court or the PO yourself and withdraw the letter.", "Sometimes you have to choose your integrity over a friend.\n\nNTA", "ESH.\n\nYou should probably contact the PO yourself, as it's clear you can't trust him to do so.
