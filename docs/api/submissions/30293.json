Your husband is shit and a moron.   \n\nAbsolutely no real friend would make a friend die their hair.", "NTA.\n\nAs someone who maintains really light hair, I can\u2019t even imagine going through nine months to get there to then be told to dye it. \n\nI would probably be backing out of this wedding, personally. You could potentially consider wearing a wig, but I can see it getting a little bit dicey if stipulations like these are already on the table and you\u2019re being told to not *even come to the wedding* if you don\u2019t abide.", "NTA, your friend and husband are way out of line. yes its \"just hair\", but its *your* hair and you arent forced to anything you dont want to do with them. you proposed a very fair alternative with wearing a wig, that wouldnt be noticed with one of a proper quality. dont cave into this.\n\nand have a proper conversation with your husband as of why he thinks its OK for him that you should let someone else control your body.", "NTA your \"friend\" is being ridiculous. Does she expect everyone over the age of 60 to dye their hair too? Or are they not invited because wrinkles will ruin the aesthetic?", "NTA. She can demand a dress code, but that certainly does not apply to your hair. If that really is an issue, I wouldn't be at that wedding. That's insane.\n\nEdit to add: Believe it or not, but psychologically, hair is really important to our personality. A certain cut makes us feel confident and feel good in our own skin. Hair is not just hair - it's a hugh part of who you are and also how you want others to see you. Keep your colour you worked so hard for!", "NTA.  I find most posts by bridesmaids on Reddit to be self entitled crap where the bridesmaid is trying to make a point about their individuality or something, but this one - you\u2019re in the right here.  Dyeing hair is way more major and I\u2019m not sure what the point is. What color is your hair now?\n\nI mean, if you currently have light hair you could use a temporary dye, but it still seems silly.", "NTA at all. How is the argument \u201cit\u2019s just hair\u201d okay to force you to dye it, but not for telling the bride to wind her neck in?", "NTA, there\u2019s no fucking way I\u2019d alter my hair (lenght or colour) for anyone. She is not your friend and your husband is an asshole too. Ask him to shave his hair for Christmas, because you know, it\u2019s just hair\u2026\n\nMy best friend went with purple for her wedding, I was moh, I despise purple, she let me wear a black dress.", "NTA\n\nYou offered a compromise, she gave an ultimatum. If she can't see she's crossed a line, she's not worth it.", "NTA. Any bride that wants their wedding party to significantly alter something about their appearance is not worth supporting.", "NTA platinum is EXPENSIVE.  depending on locale, you have easily, spent 2700 american on your hair.   beyond that, your hair won\u2019t hold the darker color she wants you to dye it.   flat out.  it would be a color correction at again, probably between 300-800. drop out of the wedding.  \n\nthe man is a different story.  he doesn\u2019t get it.  it is just hair, but it\u2019s your body, your time, your money, your energy and your core person that she\u2019s disrespecting.  explain it if he\u2019ll hear it, otherwise his opinion is ill informed and irrelevant.   decide for yourself where this falls in the grand scheme of a life together.", "NTA She is being ridiculous. It\u2019s too much of an ask. If she was that insecure she should have mentioned it in the same conversation as asking you to be a bridesmaid, instead of waiting and blowing up a friendship with her extremely petty behavior.", "NTA\n\nBrides be trippin.", "NTA. You were absolutely right. It took you literally months to get this hair colour. And if she doesn't accept. Cut her out of your life", "What's with all the hair dyeing bridesmaids stories on here? Are they all the same bride?", "The bride is TA. That's a wildly inhospitable demand to make of a wedding guest. I'd drop a friend who was that rude to me.", "NTA, it your body it your choice. It is as simple as that. And then we are not even fracturing in how much it would cost to eventually dye it back", "NTA, it's not just hair, it's the amount of effort gone to waste for a single week. Not worth it, she can accept the wig or bug off.", "NTA - He was dismissive and she demanding. It's not just hair. It's an extension of you; what you like, who you are: Your literal appearance. You offered a solution and she wants her way or nothing....it's your choice but you're not the AH.", "NTA. \n\ndon't go to the wedding and find a better friend. her demand is ridiculous. \n\nedit: find a better husband as well. yours is an AH", "NTA that's a ridiculous thing for her to ask", "NTA, your friend is absurd.  I don\u2019t know what your husband is thinking to take her side - does he not like the color and wants an excuse to suggest you change it?  His response makes no sense otherwise.  \n\nDon\u2019t let yourself be talked into a temporary dye, either.  Bleached hair is incredibly porous, that \u201ctemporary\u201d dye will be around for months, and maybe permanently.\n\nYour \u2018friend\u2019 has shown you where you fall in her priorities - below her wedding aesthetic.  When people tell you who they are, believe them.", "NTA that's a ridiculously controlling request.", "NTA yea it\u2019s just hair but it\u2019s your hair. You decide what to do with it.

A Bride's \"vision\" should NEVER be allowed to overrule your right to Body Autonomy.", "NTA. It is not a reasonable expectation to dye your hair. You've gone out of your way by saying you'd wear a wig, and that wasn't good enough.\n\nIf it were me, I'd not go at all if that's how the bride is doing to behave.", "NTA. Die your hair in bright orange with washable colour.", "NTA, but as someone who's had neon hair I can see that being distracting in photos. Your friend wants to be the center of attention at her wedding, which is what big weddings are for and considering how expensive that kind of party is it's not actually that crazy to want that. \n\n\n\n Could you be an usher or something else helpful that your friend would appreciate as a gesture without making her stressed out about all the photos?", "Weddings/brides are ridiculously stupid at this point. \n\n\nNTA.", "It depends if your hair is a nasty neon colour, however if it\u2019s a natural colour then NTA", "#DY\\*E\\*ING\n\nYou're not *killing* it.\n\nJust killing it with a fresh new look.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Don't go if the bride insists on this  she is an idiot.", "NTA. It is not reasonable to be asked to dye your hair to be part of a wedding and I will die on this hill. Frankly, it\u2019s not reasonable to be asked to make any change to your body/appearance that takes money/effort to change back or causes any damage. People don\u2019t have to change themselves for a wedding and if you think they do for yours, you should just elope and save everyone the drama. \n\nI GUESS it could be ok to ASK if they would be ok with making the change for your event but if there\u2019s any pressure or guilt about it, you\u2019re over the line.", "If they were really your friend they wouldn\u2019t care what color your hair is", "NTA\n\nIf people demand you make changes to yourself rather than just have *you* as you are, at their wedding, then I'd be inclined not to go anyway.

It suited her, just wasn\u2019t my style. \n\nNTA. The bride sucks. No white is for clothing not hair. Is she going to tell elderly guests they need to sue their hair?

Why did she deny that, if you were willing to do that?", "She certainly tries to control you. No real friend would ever do that.", "Bridesmaids are set pieces in a play, effectively like any actor.
