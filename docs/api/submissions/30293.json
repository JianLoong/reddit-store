It\u2019s a terrible argument for why she should dye it another colour when it\u2019s a far more compelling argument for just leaving it as it is. It\u2019s just hair, no guest is going to look back on the wedding and think \u201cthat one person\u2019s hair colour upstaged the whole wedding\u201d", "Girl count your blessings and drop the fuck out! Being a bridesmaid is almost universally miserable. It's nothing but hemorrhaging money, sacrificing multiple weekends, and being expected to care just as much as the bride does about the ridiculous extravaganza the average wedding has become. \n\nThis type of bride will only become increasingly demanding and expect more and more from you. And spoiler, by the day of the actual wedding you won't even want to be her friend anymore. You'll suffer through it all and likely rarely hear from her again. You'll be out a shit load of money, personal time, a friend, and your hard earned hair color. \n\nAlso, your husband is a dick. \n\nNta", "NTA. Absurd request, disappointed in your partner as well.", "NTA, I'd be super petty and buy a dark blonde wig since it's not classed as white it's more of a yellow colour. If bride to be isn't happy, I'd tell her to pay for me to get the wig of her choice since she wants her wedding to be perfect.", "Oh what?? That's insane. White hair is no big deal.", "Do not you won't be able to get it back. White hair, even temporary color will not come out. It's been bleached so it'll pick up and color you put on it no matter how \"temporary\" it says it is.", "Does your friend realize that the \u201cno white\u201d rule is for clothing and not hair?\n\nAnd if your hair takes attention, is she asking her grandma to dye her hair? It\u2019s a no white hair rule right? \n\nI have naturally white hair. It turned whit early (I\u2019m in my 40s) and if I was asked to dye my hair for a wedding I\u2019d laugh and say no", "Could be he doesn't understand how it is such a big deal for OP and that she spent 9 months doing whatever it is to achieve it. \n\nI'm a bloke and if I don't like a haircut, just shave it all off. But I'm smart enough to know that my wife spends a ridiculous amount of money on her hair, so I figure it's important to her. I don't care what colour it is and will gently voice opinions when she has wanted extreme changes, but ultimately told her it's her hair do whatever makes her feel good. \n\nWhat gets me is that a wig isn't allowed. Almost like the friend wants OP to fuck her hair up and using a wig means she doesn't have to do that. I wonder if it's some friendship test to see how far OP would go for her and the easy solution fucked things up.", "I guess he thinks white hair is for old people and he hates it in secret.  I think white hair is cool, like elf babe.", "I think he's just trying to keep the peace.  But something this ridiculous isn't worth keeping the peace over.", "This made me think of Ross on Friends over-whitening his teeth for a date and then having his mouth glow because the date had black light art in her apartment. \ud83e\udd23", "Or neon green. Anything to really make a statement. \ud83d\ude02", "my hair is bright pink and i can tell you it does carry a certain amount of \u201cfuck you\u201d with it", "and make it glitter", "See if he will dye his hair in solidarity since it's just hair.", "Oh so love the petty play, OP I totally agree with AA above. \nI would give anything to have my salt and pepper go white, need to get a Gandolf wand wave lol\nOoh and you are definately NTA", "No joke. I have white/silver hair as well, and I know the struggle. It costs 180$ every 3 months to do my roots and touch up. Anybody who is actually my friend would never ask me to dye my hair for one day considering the time and effort I put into maintaining it. I'd definitely wear a wig if I was given an option, but since that's not the case...\n\nSo no, Casey, I will not dye my hair and I'll sleep good at night knowing I don't have to waste time worrying about your wedding. \n\nHave a nice life, sweetheart~!\n\nI will be the asshole with no regrets.", "White, that\u2019s why it\u2019s not allowed", "Glad I'm not the only one.", "When this girl got remarried later she had them straighten it and put it into a chignon and it looked beautiful. She just needed a good professional.", "Yes! If for some reason the bride knows someone who would think this (I can see an elderly woman being like this), tell them to fuck off and get over hair. \n\nI was thinking I\u2019d ask the friend if she was willing to pay for the dye job\u2026 more than likely a no answer, but it\u2019d be interesting to hear why she says no.", "On,y the bride gets to wear white \u2026 hair?", "> Bridesmaids are set pieces in a play, effectively like any actor. That doesn\u2019t make them not people. It does make the production more important than them, to a certain degree.\n\nThis sounds kinda psychotic. They are people, not set pieces.", "I hope the soda didn\u2019t dye any nose hairs. Otherwise you\u2019ll have to dye them back to another colour.", "No, all the colors like a unicorn!", "~~WHITE dye the hair white.....~~  oops didn't see her comment LOL", "Exactly!! Heaven forbid you have long hair and want to keep it as healthy as possible through color treatments. \n\nI do my hair myself and it still costs a lot of my time & money to do it the right way. I know people who spend close to $1k over time trying to achieve optimum color goals (usually the grey/silvers like you have)!", "A supportive partner would have thought about how his/her partner wants to be seen and identified. Cost is a non- issue.", "I take offense to that remark. I am envious of hair and wish I had it so I COULD dye it and do fun things with it.\n\nBUT NO instead I have to paint my head if I want any color on top.", "Thankfully, no. I\u2019m all good on that front, but I appreciate your concern.", "Ummm, where are you going that you get professional coloring at that price?", "You can be a supportive partner in so many aspects and yet completely oblivious at the same time. This guy probably thinks \u201cit\u2019s just hair\u201d without knowing the time and cost that goes into getting white blonde hair. It doesn\u2019t make him unsupportive. It just makes him a bit uninformed on the situation.", "You, my dear, would be asked to buy and wear a wig by *this bride* so that you wouldn\u2019t take any of the attention away from her on her day", "Bald women are elite.", "Wigs!!  or Toupee's as the case may be.\n\nMind I knew someone with a really obvious toupee and I thought nothing could be worse, until I saw him without it.  A good quality toupee/wig is essential."]}
