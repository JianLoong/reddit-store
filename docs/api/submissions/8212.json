The week before last, I noticed that she had gotten her ears pierced but I didn\u2019t say anything about it as I wasn\u2019t quite sure what to say. \n\nI\u2019ll be honest, I felt very disappointed as our religion says to not have any piercings at all and by going against that she is going against the rules of our house. \n\nSo this Sunday, before she came over for dinner I asked her if she could please remove her earrings. She said she couldn\u2019t, the hole would grow over and she wouldn\u2019t have the piercings any longer. I replied that I only wanted her to take them out for dinner, she could put them back in later. She said that she wouldn\u2019t be able to put them back in if they were out for that long. So I decided to just invite her over anyways, and texted her to just come have dinner then. \n\nShe said she would be over in about 20 minutes but about a half hour later she texted and said she wasn\u2019t really hungry anyways so she wasn\u2019t going to come.\nShe has been very distant for the past few days, answering my texts with one-word answers and not replying to me when I call. I do feel justified as she shouldn\u2019t be going against our religion if she wants to come to the house but my friend says I shouldn\u2019t alienate her as that might turn her all the way against her family.

I knew, from an extremely young age, how my parents prioritize their religious beliefs over everything else.  The thing with religion though, is that, while you can teach it to your children, when they become adults, they must , themselves, choose how to define their relationship with any god they do or do not believe in.  This is not something you can do for them, ever.  \n\nSo, you have a choice before you.  Which do you value more, your relationship with your daughter, a child you birthed and presumably raised to adulthood, or the man-made rules of the religion you follow?

Adults can decide what religion they subscribe to, children are unfortunately dragged into whatever their parents choose, or were subjected to as they were children.

Religion is meant to work for you. Although your daughter may have been raised in that religion it doesn\u2019t mean that she will automatically subscribe to the exact same interpretation of canonized doctrine that you do. \n\nI do believe, however, that you did not cross any boundaries by asking her to take her earrings out for dinner. If they hadn\u2019t been recently pierced and there wasn\u2019t a risk of the piercing closing up, I believe asking someone to take earrings out is perhaps the equivalent of asking someone to take their shoes off.\n\nI do think that you became the AH when you pushed the issue after she provided an explanation as to why she didn\u2019t want/couldn\u2019t take her earrings out, and used shared religion to, in essence, shame her for not automatically ceding to your beliefs.", "YTA.

No, of course not. And we all draw our personal boundaries differently.\n\nSo it comes down to whether you were reminding your daughter of the pre-existing dress code that applies to all visitors to your home, regardless of religion, or whether you were intentionally singling her out because you disapprove of her choice to get earrings.

Not a big deal.\n\nHowever, about the idea of taking them out for a short time, I was with you, that taking them out for a few hours isn't a big deal. However, I did some searches on the Internet, and apparently it is.

She said she couldn\u2019t, the hole would grow over and she wouldn\u2019t have the piercings any longer. I replied that I only wanted her to take them out for dinner, she could put them back in later. She said that she wouldn\u2019t be able to put them back in if they were out for that long. So I decided to just invite her over anyways, and texted her to just come have dinner then. \n     She said she would be over in about 20 minutes but about a half hour later she texted and said she wasn\u2019t really hungry anyways so she wasn\u2019t going to come.\n     She has been very distant for the past few days, answering my texts with one-word answers and not replying to me when I call. I do feel justified as she shouldn\u2019t be going against our religion if she wants to come to the house but my friend says I shouldn\u2019t alienate her as that might turn her all the way against her family.

Since this is a question concerning religious beliefs, I\u2019m going to take a more philosophical or religious approach to this one, since it might better clarify certain things.

The only religion that sometimes doesn\u2019t allow for piercings is Sikhism. But oftentimes, even if a religion doesn\u2019t allow for certain things, different sects within said religion don\u2019t have a problem with these forbidden or taboo things. Oftentimes, certain things were made taboo thousands of years ago for no other reason than to distinguish said religion from others, or for reasons that aren\u2019t applicable to today.\n\nFor example, the Old Testament forbids the blending of fabrics, consumption of shellfish, the consumption of blood, etc. However, if you look further into it, it could be interpreted as an attempt to separate Judaism from other religions of the time. To help give Jews traditions and a sense of community. Or, perhaps some of the foods were said to \u201cunclean\u201d because they were more likely to cause illness, and in order to protect the followers of this newly founded religion, they were simply said to be unclean, rather than trying to explain the fact that they could be unsafe to consume.\n\nMany religions encourage their followers to contemplate why certain traditions exist in order to give people a better understanding of their faith, and to help them in their journey. There\u2019s nothing wrong with exploring such things, since it often helps to depend one\u2019s faith. And as with many things in life, it never hurts to try to see different perspectives or try to understand why people within your religion might interpret things differently.", "YTA\n\nyou set the rules for your house, she set the rules for her body.\n\nShe is holding to both, maybe once the piercing has healed in a few months and she can remove then for an afternoon then she might start coming round. \n\nI get the impression that in the past you have made her well aware as to what is more important to you when it comes to her and religion.

They can't communicate? Coming to terms with something new is a negotiation/communication. If OP hasn't seen anyone in their close circle with piercings, they are trying to negotiate what they feel is reasonable. People don't come to terms with new information in an instant. There is a period of adjustment.", "Ugh.", "That\u2019s not your choice to make. If she got her ears pierced, she obviously wants them in.", "So your argument is that if someone visits your home, you have the right to permanently modify their body?", "Taking care of it includes not removing it until it heals.", "Taking care of it properly *means* not taking out the earring until it has healed.\n\nAnd you\u2019re really glossing over the fact that OP is upset that his adult daughter is now distant because he tried to use the \u201cmy house my rules\u201d bit to manipulate her into following his religious practices.", "Manners and body modification are not in the same wheelhouse.  It's shifting the goalpost and sets up a strawman argument.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe whole thing is op the asshole because she won't let her daughter in over an ear piercing, yes, yes she is. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou shifted the goalpost to nonsense and made a bad comparison to justify it."]}
