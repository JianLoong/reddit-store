She removed herself from the party since she couldn\u2019t make it about her.  You gave her the option of bringing her own food after already catering to her needs once.  She refused and didn\u2019t come.  This is not your issue but hers.\n\nI also don\u2019t understand the trend where guests make the hosts cater to their out of the box diets.  Most of the friends I have had that are vegetarian or vegan bring a dish they know they can eat, as well as asking if other things would be available.  There was a post a couple days ago about a woman requiring her mother to make an entirely separate Thanksgiving dinner on top of the normal meal and refused to bring her own food because she wasn\u2019t the host.  These people are exhausting to even read let alone deal with.", "NTA. Firstly, she CHOSE that diet after being introduced to it while away. \nSecondly, since she had approved of the vegan options you sent her while she was away, why didn\u2019t she say anything about her new diet then?\nThirdly, YOU\u2019RE the one who\u2019s having a baby and YOU\u2019RE the one who\u2019s spending all the money and hosting an event related to your baby. For her to just suddenly remember that you have changed your diet (again) and inform you last minute and not be happy that you can\u2019t accommodate (after doing your best to make sure you did), she\u2019s the one throwing a tantrum It\u2019s not uncommon for people to bring their own meals when they have dietary restrictions or choices. She could easily have done that.\n\nEDIT: I just realized it was all approved before she left, but if it was that important, she should have tried to let you know right away. Regardless. That stuff is expensive so if you\u2019re not able to accommodate, she should be understanding and flexible. CONGRATS ON YOUR BABY GIRL!", "NTA - since when do u fund her diet ? And at such short notice as well", "NTA. Sounds like you already bent over backwards in order to accommodate her in every way, and her latest request was simply over the line. \n\nThere is such a thing as asking for too much, and this is a perfect example of that.", "NTA.\n\nIt is certainly the obligation of a host / hostess to ensure that guests' dietary needs are accounted for whenever possible.  And you did just that!  Your sister even approved your food choices!\n\nUntil she didn't, two days before the party. Her request (demand, actually) goes far beyond what is reasonably affordable or attainable with such short notice.\n\nAnd, unless your text to her was sent with deliberately rude / trigger-pushing language, NTA for that as well. \n\nThis is all on your sister.  I hope you two can reconcile.", "NTA. She removed herself from the party, it's not you who did not include her. You gave her the alternative of buying and bringing her own expensive food but she refused. For someone who is into spirituality, she's surprisingly picky and demanding. Most people right now are struggling to make ends meet and she's complaining about the food she will be served for free at a gender reveal party... Wow.", "NTA. You did accommodate her diet (yay for the separate grill!). You can't be expected to continually check in with guests as the date approaches to make sure you can accommodate any dietary choices that might change.", "NTA.  You attempted to plan for her needs; she made last-minute changes.  She could bring her own food (completely fair) or - this may be crazy - just come to support your parenthood journey and eat before or after the party.  Being a good host requires understanding your guests and providing the necessary components for them to enjoy the event, to the extent it is within your financial, physical, and psychological means to do so.  It does not obligate you to accommodate absolutely every whim of every guest, regardless of cost, practicality, or notice.", "NTA they aren't dietary needs if she just discovered at a retreat", "Lol hope your sister has a good job because her diet is going to be expensive.\n\nNTA", "NTA. She approved the food beforehand then changed it a few days before. You already made an accommodation and she is demanding another one. She was more than welcome to bring her own food and join in.", "NTA. She's being completely unreasonable.", "NTA.   I (and my kids) have dietary restrictions and I offer to bring food to family gatherings.  I don\u2019t ever want to be a bother.  \nIt makes me feel so happy and loved when they go out of their way to include us, I certainly don\u2019t expect it.  It is more expensive, mostly because it\u2019s healthier and as we know eating healthy is freaking expensive these days.  I would never put that burden on them!  \nYour sister made a sudden change, right before your party.  She\u2019s the one who is wrong here.  I can see (sort of, if I squint and tip my head) how she could have some hurt feelings, because you have accommodated her in the past and it may have felt to her like you suddenly decided not to.  It feels like a stretch though. I wonder if she was looking for an excuse to not come to the party.   Is she maybe jealous of your pregnancy? Or worried that a baby will change your relationship, since you said that you have always been close?  Did she think that she would have a baby first?  Is she single? Is it possible you have the \u201clife she wants\u201d??  I could be making things up to try to make her reaction seem reasonable to me.  I am just trying to think about my own sister and fights we have had that made no sense to me.  They always turned out to be about something else entirely.  \nCongratulations on your baby girl!!", "NTA \n\nYou did include her. You got the stuff that was fine for her to eat before she decided that she needed organic oatmeal cookies, then she pays for them herself, brings her own or has what you already bought and was previously fine.\n\nIf she is taking this new diet seriously, then she needs to accept that not everyone is going to be able to cater to her and she should pack a lunch.", "NTA- you did include her and catered to her. She is entitled if she thinks everything should be dropped and changed just for her. I have actual dietary needs and I always offer to bring food if I know what is being served will cause allergy attacks for me. I don\u2019t expect others to cater to me and neither should your sister.\n\nCongrats on your baby girl!", "NTA\n\nShe's acting very entitled.", "NTA but it's sad that you're so used to catering to your sister (pun intended) that you think you might be. \n\nYou literally held your event on a date based on your *sister's* availability, then went to the trouble of designing a second menu and sharing it for approval. Her entitlement to assume that you'd rearrange that, last minute and at your own expense, and then NOT SHOW UP when you apologized and offered additional solutions is heinous. \n\nThat this is all to the point where you're even considering that YOU might have done something wrong, speaks to how entrenched all this behavior probably is.", "NTA. she can bring her own food, the last minute change to her diet is her problem. Also, I'd be concerned about her constant diet changing, especially while pregnant. I'm wondering how bad it's going to get when she is breastfeeding or feeding the baby food for the first time. It might benefit her to speak with a certified and *registered* dietician.
