We scheduled the party for a week afterwards so she could make it and for the food my mum and my BF's dad did a BBQ in the garden.

She removed herself from the party since she couldn\u2019t make it about her.  You gave her the option of bringing her own food after already catering to her needs once.  She refused and didn\u2019t come.  This is not your issue but hers.\n\nI also don\u2019t understand the trend where guests make the hosts cater to their out of the box diets.  Most of the friends I have had that are vegetarian or vegan bring a dish they know they can eat, as well as asking if other things would be available.  There was a post a couple days ago about a woman requiring her mother to make an entirely separate Thanksgiving dinner on top of the normal meal and refused to bring her own food because she wasn\u2019t the host.  These people are exhausting to even read let alone deal with.", "NTA. Firstly, she CHOSE that diet after being introduced to it while away. \nSecondly, since she had approved of the vegan options you sent her while she was away, why didn\u2019t she say anything about her new diet then?\nThirdly, YOU\u2019RE the one who\u2019s having a baby and YOU\u2019RE the one who\u2019s spending all the money and hosting an event related to your baby. For her to just suddenly remember that you have changed your diet (again) and inform you last minute and not be happy that you can\u2019t accommodate (after doing your best to make sure you did), she\u2019s the one throwing a tantrum It\u2019s not uncommon for people to bring their own meals when they have dietary restrictions or choices. She could easily have done that.\n\nEDIT: I just realized it was all approved before she left, but if it was that important, she should have tried to let you know right away. Regardless. That stuff is expensive so if you\u2019re not able to accommodate, she should be understanding and flexible. CONGRATS ON YOUR BABY GIRL!", "NTA - since when do u fund her diet ? And at such short notice as well", "NTA. Sounds like you already bent over backwards in order to accommodate her in every way, and her latest request was simply over the line. \n\nThere is such a thing as asking for too much, and this is a perfect example of that.", "NTA.\n\nIt is certainly the obligation of a host / hostess to ensure that guests' dietary needs are accounted for whenever possible.

I hope you two can reconcile.", "NTA. She removed herself from the party, it's not you who did not include her. You gave her the alternative of buying and bringing her own expensive food but she refused. For someone who is into spirituality, she's surprisingly picky and demanding. Most people right now are struggling to make ends meet and she's complaining about the food she will be served for free at a gender reveal party... Wow.", "NTA. You did accommodate her diet (yay for the separate grill!). You can't be expected to continually check in with guests as the date approaches to make sure you can accommodate any dietary choices that might change.", "NTA.  You attempted to plan for her needs; she made last-minute changes.  She could bring her own food (completely fair) or - this may be crazy - just come to support your parenthood journey and eat before or after the party.  Being a good host requires understanding your guests and providing the necessary components for them to enjoy the event, to the extent it is within your financial, physical, and psychological means to do so.  It does not obligate you to accommodate absolutely every whim of every guest, regardless of cost, practicality, or notice.", "NTA they aren't dietary needs if she just discovered at a retreat", "Lol hope your sister has a good job because her diet is going to be expensive.\n\nNTA", "NTA. She approved the food beforehand then changed it a few days before. You already made an accommodation and she is demanding another one. She was more than welcome to bring her own food and join in.", "NTA. She's being completely unreasonable.", "NTA.   I (and my kids) have dietary restrictions and I offer to bring food to family gatherings.  I don\u2019t ever want to be a bother.  \nIt makes me feel so happy and loved when they go out of their way to include us, I certainly don\u2019t expect it.  It is more expensive, mostly because it\u2019s healthier and as we know eating healthy is freaking expensive these days.  I would never put that burden on them!  \nYour sister made a sudden change, right before your party.  She\u2019s the one who is wrong here.  I can see (sort of, if I squint and tip my head) how she could have some hurt feelings, because you have accommodated her in the past and it may have felt to her like you suddenly decided not to.  It feels like a stretch though. I wonder if she was looking for an excuse to not come to the party.   Is she maybe jealous of your pregnancy? Or worried that a baby will change your relationship, since you said that you have always been close?  Did she think that she would have a baby first?  Is she single? Is it possible you have the \u201clife she wants\u201d??  I could be making things up to try to make her reaction seem reasonable to me.  I am just trying to think about my own sister and fights we have had that made no sense to me.  They always turned out to be about something else entirely.  \nCongratulations on your baby girl!!", "NTA \n\nYou did include her. You got the stuff that was fine for her to eat before she decided that she needed organic oatmeal cookies, then she pays for them herself, brings her own or has what you already bought and was previously fine.\n\nIf she is taking this new diet seriously, then she needs to accept that not everyone is going to be able to cater to her and she should pack a lunch.", "NTA- you did include her and catered to her. She is entitled if she thinks everything should be dropped and changed just for her. I have actual dietary needs and I always offer to bring food if I know what is being served will cause allergy attacks for me. I don\u2019t expect others to cater to me and neither should your sister.\n\nCongrats on your baby girl!", "NTA\n\nShe's acting very entitled.", "NTA but it's sad that you're so used to catering to your sister (pun intended) that you think you might be. \n\nYou literally held your event on a date based on your *sister's* availability, then went to the trouble of designing a second menu and sharing it for approval. Her entitlement to assume that you'd rearrange that, last minute and at your own expense, and then NOT SHOW UP when you apologized and offered additional solutions is heinous. \n\nThat this is all to the point where you're even considering that YOU might have done something wrong, speaks to how entrenched all this behavior probably is.", "NTA. she can bring her own food, the last minute change to her diet is her problem. Also, I'd be concerned about her constant diet changing, especially while pregnant. I'm wondering how bad it's going to get when she is breastfeeding or feeding the baby food for the first time. It might benefit her to speak with a certified and *registered* dietician.

That's crazy.", "NTA \n\nYou did include her, she chose not to come. She was welcome to bring her own food. You\u2019re not her slave.", "NTA - You did try to accommodate your sister's diet but she changed the game at a point where it's not possible financially to change it. Yeah, she was on a retreat but she could have made contact in some fashion sooner.", "NTA\nYou\u2019re 100% right", "NTA She has made a dietary choice: it is not a dietary need. She asked for food, which you purchased. The fact she changed her mind, is not your fault.  She wouldn't get sick from eating what you had already bought and could have eaten it for one day. I would imagine there aren't many people willing/able to cook organic vegan food from scratch and that she needs to start taking her own food places from now on.", "She can't just come up with some wild new, entirely voluntary diet on a whim and expect to be catered to, especially not at the last minute. If she is that adamant about her newfound dietary restrictions she can bring food that will accommodate them. NTA", "NTA. So California smh", "It sounds like maybe she is doing a Whole 30 type diet? I tried this as best I could several years ago - it was extra hard because I\u2019m vegetarian. If I ate out or at someone\u2019s house, I just went with whatever vegetarian food they had. I didn\u2019t even tell anyone I was doing Whole 30, because I don\u2019t like people to think I\u2019m being precious, or to make my food choices the main event. I know special diets are exhausting for hosts, and the person requesting the special diet either needs to suck it up or bring their own food. Absolutely NTA", "NTA and tell her that veggie crisps are processed and not good for you at all so her new diet isn\u2019t all it\u2019s cracked up to be.", "NTA, ive never met someone who asks people to accommodate such specific diets. \"I dont eat meat\" or an allergy is one thing, but an expensive ass fad diet? F that. I hope she realizes what a huge fuck up she made by letting that get in the way of your relationship. She couldve easily just brought her own snacks.", "NTA\nYou did include her, she just chose to exclude herself with her entitlement.  The party was about you and your baby, not her and her dietary wants.\nCongratulations on you baby girl\u2764\u2764", "NTA. Your sister is behaving like a spoilt child. You already have a baby on the way, so the last thing you need is to manage an adult version as well. You provided your sister with options and went over and above to accommodate. Don\u2019t feel an ounce of guilt. She is in the wrong.", "NTA. \nWhat!? Ohhhh my gosh No.\nGood god she sounds like such a entitled little butthole. You guys should tease her every chance you get. Don\u2019t even make her vegan options anymore. She can come eat the watermelon and drink lemonade at the BBQ and stop being a huge pain in your butt! \n\nEnjoy your pregnancy! Your sister will just have to get over herself. Hopefully she does!", "NTA \n\nYou specifically already altered your party date and food to accommodate your sister. She's entitled to think you should have altered again! \n\nThis was your party to celebrate your family. This had nothing to do with her. She's not the most important human at that party, or on earth. She could have easily eaten prior to the event/ brought herb own food when her diet changed right before YOUR party.", "She's gonna need to get used to bringing her own food if she's only willing to eat Vegan food made from scratch - I can't imagine a lot of people are going to be able to accommodate 'cook something totally from scratch or buy something super expensive' as a food preference, especially as she is doing this voluntarily and not as a need.", "I\u2019d like 24K gold and unmarked $100 bills as my dietary need please", "This. NTA", "I don't know what the big deal is. Unprocessed organic vegan foods from scratch is cheap and easy. \n\nLarge bowl + large bag organic spinach = unprocessed organic vegan meal.\n\nOrganic apple = unprocessed organic vegan dessert.\n\nOP clearly just isn't trying very hard.", "Main character syndrome. Sis can't bear the thought of not being the centre of attention at her sister's gender reveal party so she had to come up with something outrageous.", ">I also don\u2019t understand the trend where guests make the hosts cater to their out of the box diets.\n\n I think there is a minimum level of politeness a host should be expected to reach when someone has a dietary restriction. This is clearly out there (okayed food previously, now expects you to buy particularly expensive new food)-- but I do think that a host who has a vegan coming should be expected to have some vegan offerings. There's a difference between a host refusing to cook vegan for a guest when half of their sides could be made vegan by substituting vegetable oil for bacon grease, which is an asshole move, and a situation like this. When you could provide for a dietary restriction at little extra effort and little extra cost, I would say it absolutely is rude to ask a guest to bring their own food.\n\n>There was a post a couple days ago about a woman requiring her mother to make an entirely separate Thanksgiving dinner on top of the normal meal and refused to bring her own food because she wasn\u2019t the host. \n\nMaybe you saw a different post than I did, but the one about Thanksgiving a few days ago featured a MIL who refused to let the person with the dietary restriction bring their own food even though they offered? I do think a host does have a minimum requirement to, if they aren't offering to meet their guests' meal requirements, allow those guests to provide their own food.", "I just tell people I'm full on omnivore though there might be some carrot sticks or something", "And you know, OP could not  have wasted their money on anything they might have been something only their sister would eat.", "Yup, may have just cost her a sister and baby niece.", "That sounds delicious, thank you for the recommendation!", "My aunt suffers from some of the same conditions and brought her own food to the party which we previously agreed on and it caused no fuss! Wishing you the best, rheumatoid arthritis sucks", "Not to mention that a LOT of those retreats are eerily cult-like.", "We decided to have a gender reveal because we wanted to celebrate the pregnancy with our close friends and family, and of course if our baby tells us they're a different gender we will accept that, just a cute way to find out :) I came here for advice on the situation with my sister, not for other people to criticise my personal pregnancy choices lol", "Why should ppl stop having those parties??", "I don't see any issue with catering to her being vegan. I'm more than happy to, it's her beliefs and I understand why she is and I respect that. My issue is her changing up so fast", "This sounds like a you problem. This was a backyard BBQ, not an elaborate nine course meal, with pairings.", "This sounds like a you problem. This was a backyard BBQ, not an elaborate nine course meal, with pairings.", "Uuuuchhh. I see you've met my cousin. Tell her I say hi, gave up trying to have a conversation with her years ago.", "Agreed but I\u2019d call them dietary choices instead. Because she chooses to be this exhausting.", "And her \"outrageous\" isn't even something fun like a cake where you slice it to reveal pink or blue filling or a dancing monkey singing telegram it's \"I DEMAND BRAN PUCKS FOR CONSUMPTION.\" I wonder if she notices that every party ends 15 minutes after she shows up.", "I totally get it from the host side.  We routinely have veggie burgers and vegan aligned salads at out BBQs along with meaty goodness (we are unapologetic carnivores). What I don\u2019t get is guests insisting on being catered to above and beyond what the hosts bare able or comfortable to do and then also refusing to bring their own dish when asked to.  \n\nFrom the host mentality I get want by to be accommodating and in this case OP already accommodated and got buy in from her sister.  Then the sister\u2019s diet changed and OP was supposed to go above and beyond when the sister refused to donut for herself.  To me that\u2019s entitled.", "The one I saw was a daughter refusing to come to Thanksgiving because her mother would not cook a completely separate meal for her boyfriend and would not bring their own food because they thought it would be rude even after expressly being asked by mom to do exactly that.  The mental gymnastics for that one were astounding.\n\nI agree that if you can cater to dietary restrictions you should (yes using Crisco in your pie crust rather than butter or lard for vegans is another example), and in this case OP did that.  When expectations or restrictions changed, the person with the restrictions should also be willing to bring something themselves as well.", "That\u2019s true. Idk if I\u2019d want to spend that much if only one person will be eating it. It just seems it\u2019s be easier for them to bring it themselves.", "Ha! Someone downvoted us for stating 2 facts.", "Italian cuisine haas a lot of delicious dishes that are considered \u201cpoor\u201d because they used to be affordable by the lower social class. Pasta al pomodoro (pasta with tomatoes) was one of them. Ironically they are often sought out by vegans or vegetarians, because poor=unable to afford meat. But your average nonna, or mamma, don\u2019t think about them as vegetarian/vegan special meals because they are so ingrained into popular cuisine. Pasta with a simple tomato sauce is first of all a quick meal, something you do when you don\u2019t have time to cook, or the Italian equivalent of a ramen dinner for students", "One thing I will add here is to make sure the pasta doesn't have eggs in it. Made that mistake before. Oof.", "I\u2019m allergic to onions and can only eat them when they\u2019re cooked down to mush (something about the enzymes breaking down enough to not flare my allergy up), I can\u2019t even touch or prep them without getting sick, I feel you on this. It always feels so bad to have to turn down people\u2019s cooking, especially when it smells really good.", "That would definitely be a need. \n\nThe want would be if you just don\u2019t like the taste of onions though most good friends would certainly take that into account. \n\nHave you tried making sauce or salsa without onions?    It certainly isn\u2019t a requirement.", "Heck no, I only interacted with her because I had to because of a program we were both in.  As soon as I didn't have to I stopped talking to her since I didn't feel like being lectured about yoga or veganism or have someone trying to shill \"elixirs\" at me from whatever MLM she was currently involved in or that she'd whipped of herself from experimenting with essential oils at home.", "Yeah completely agree on all counts", "I hope you let people know, I would happily accommodate an allergy I can for friends/family. Sister's last minute change their, Wow. That's a ridiculous amount of expected accommodation expected AFTER a last minute mine change, yikes.", "So you DO know my cousin, hahahaha!"]}
