A model so we grew up hearing how she was a slut and how the girls would probably be the same, how they are extremely shallow and dumb for liking makeup and fashion or stupid for not speaking English very well (they do speak it now)\n\nDuring our childhood they travelled quite a few times and our family would just not show up. Mind you, i think from Korea it's like a 13 hour fly. We never visited, we never learned their language so being with them was awkward, if they called, our parents wouldn't pick up and would tell us to hang up the phone if it was them. The few times they actually were with us, my parents would ignore them or be plain rude, something that always stood out to me is when Jessica got so sick she got dehydrated because my parents wouldn't care for her. My sister Amber and i would be mean too tbh althought we were children, Jessica and Krystal don't see our family anymore\n\nThey were always nice, they would share their stuff with us even when we were mean, they made an effort with the language barrier. The few times i saw their mom she was really kind, they always got us both christmas and birthday presents.\n\nAs i grew up i realised how fucked up everything was and when i was 16O i reached out to them and we started talking. I apologized, i unlearned stuff and we now get along. They are like those girls you find in the bathroom at a club at night. Super funny, super cute, super pretty, i adore them.\nThey both have been there for me through my last break up, i have been there for both of them when a few stuff happened, we get along well.\n\nRecently our grandma died. She is the only one that has always been nice to them and they actually came for the funeral (they were in the country so not much travel) there's been troubles with my parents, the inheritance, things i expected tbh but what surprised me was how upset Amber was at them being \"rude\"? They did say hi to everyone but mostly stayed together (or with me if no one was close) and talked only when talked to. Apparently that was rude of them and after the funeral when they left, Amber started cursing them and talking shit, it was SO annoying. \n\nI ended up telling her that maybe they wouldn't have been \"rude\" if our parents had not put us against them and that she had to grow up and realise that already. She got extremely upset that i insinuated that our parents did something wrong and mom and dad did too. If i was low contact with them i guess i'm no contact now and Amber has only talked to me to insult me. I feel like an asshole because i guess she's too young to realise that and honestly, our parents have been good to us so i should have said nothing instead of making them look bad, i guess i'm confused", "created_utc": 1670395035, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zeu8nr/aita_for_telling_my_sister_that_is_our_parents/", "score": 182, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Hopefully it\u2019s a catalyst to help her come to terms with it", "NTA\n\nYour parents made themselves look bad by telling lies about your half-sister's mother. \n\nI'm assuming by the ages and timeline that your dad either cheated on their mom or your mom at some point and that's why there's so much animosity.\n\nIt's a shame that they've poisoned the relationship and your sister hasn't matured enough to realize that they're not right about everything. Hopefully, she'll mature and wise up sooner than later.", "NTA, sounds like you were just honest. It's hard for people to admit their opinions were wrong or based off how they were raised rather than their own experiences and logic. It's even harder if that information is coming from someone else rather than how it was with you where you made the realization on your own. If you're able to speak to your sister about it again you should avoid blaming her or your parents and keep it focused on yourself, that you realized your own preconceived ideas about them were wrong once you got to know them better. They are your siblings, you both should have a relationship with them outside of your relationships with your parents. It's very unfair and immature of your parents to keep that from you because of their experience with their mother. At the same time you can't force anyone to see the situation your way.", "Your sister is an asshole because your parents created her to be and she never woke up one day thinking she was an asshole and should change. Your older siblings were and still are getting treated like they don\u2019t matter by your family. You did the right thing by calling them all out on their bad behavior. Thankfully you grew up and you stopped being an asshole towards your older sisters. NTA because you are the only one who acts like an adult.", "NTA. You were telling her the truth.\nShe is old enough to start thinking for herself and maybe get to the same conclusion as you did, if not, that's on her.\nBe warned, some people LIKE conflict, gossip and drama, it might be her choice to keep the conflict on.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
