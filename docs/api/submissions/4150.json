My sister Amber and i would be mean too tbh althought we were children, Jessica and Krystal don't see our family anymore\n\nThey were always nice, they would share their stuff with us even when we were mean, they made an effort with the language barrier.

They are your siblings, you both should have a relationship with them outside of your relationships with your parents.
