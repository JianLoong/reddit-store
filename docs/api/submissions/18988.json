Alternatively, an ambulance as you suggested. Sure, an ambulance costs money, but so does missing a week of work and your medical bills when you catch this. \n\nPutting yourself in the line of fire for the same sickness makes no sense.", "NTA! Not your responsibility", "If I watched 5 sick kids, then got sick and missed a week of work, I'd probably get fired or not be able to pay my bills.  Cannot afford to get sick in the good ol' USA.  NTA. I guess you could have offered to be the driver, but she would have still been upset that you didn't watch the kids.", "NTA, Why does she want to leave you with her kids if you know you don\u2019t have a great relationship? Also, the problem with having someone watch her kids while she takes her husband to the ER is that the person watching her kids will obviously get sick as well. You gave her two viable options. He could have called a cab too. Not very nice of her to start a phone tree about you after the fact. I get her being mad in the moment but like was said all 5 of her kids were sick so it\u2019s not like she asked you to keep 5 healthy kids at bay for a couple of hours.", "NTA.  They are all extremely contagious, the smartest thing would be to provide transport to the adult who should know what needs to be done to prevent spreading the virus.  Asking you to go look after children that you have no experience looking after in such a situation is just asking for you to get the virus too.", "NTA\n\nYou say you don\u2019t really have any relationship with her or her kids.  \n\nShe wanted a break from the sick kids\u2026. Meanwhile you would be at risk of catching their virus.", "NTA. If this was one of those \"I'm child free and there was a family emergency but I just wanted to watch netflix and chill\" then you'd probably be the AH. But given the circumstances, that a) you aren't close to your sister emotionally, and b) they're SICK with a highly contagious  virus (that is sending one of them to the ER no less) I really don't think you're an asshole for turning that down. Maybe you could have been nicer about it.\n\nBut as parents of 5 kids I feel like they need to already have a plan in place for what to do in an emergency, as well as designated people who have accepted such a responsibility they can count on to watch their kids. Also if they can't afford an ambulance they probably can't afford the ER, might as well have footed the extra bill. There's lots of programs in place to help people reduce extreme bills.", "NTA.", "I\u2019d normally say helping family is the priority, but they have the norovirus! Anyone who\u2019s had that sucker knows it is *no joke.* This has nothing to do with being child free - entering that house pretty much guarantees you catching it, too. It\u2019s hard for anyone to get sick, but a single person living away from home with no other support system to nurse you? You would be in for a hell of a week or two by yourself.\n\nSister had another viable option for help - it makes more sense for his mother to take him than for anyone else to enter the house and get further exposed to the virus. I understand sister being scared and frustrated, but she is lacking the very empathy she wanted in this situation. \n\nBut fair warning: if you don\u2019t help in their emergencies, you can\u2019t expect help in return during your own emergencies.

She should have called family that knows those kids and has been with those kids long enough to know some what of how to take care of them. Especially with an ER trip cause those can take so long and leaving someone with no child experience could be dangerous", "NTA \n\nWhere's your violin?\n\nHold your ground.

I hate it when other people want to share their germs.", "NTA I think you and your sister could\u2019ve worked around not being around the kids. I\u2019m not too sure why mil couldn\u2019t drive her husband.

Your recommendation was reasonable. Asking someone inexperienced with kids to take care of five sick kids is irresponsible.", "NTA", "Uhh, why couldn't the adult man take himself to the hospital if the situation wasn't serious enough to call an ambulance? I get that it's never fun to be in the hospital by yourself, but sometimes it has to be that way. \n\nAlso, norovirus is highly contagious and it's a big ask to have anyone look after children that are sick. Much less someone who has zero experience looking after children even when they're healthy. \n\nNTA. I would have offered to mask up and drive him to the hospital before caring for five kids with norovirus.", "Nta you need more than five persons to take care of five kids for a week. The answer to this problem is other.", "ESH. I wouldn't have agreed to manage 5 kids/infants that I had no experience or relationship with either, but the real issue here is your BIL's health.  Your sister was more focused on getting away from the kids as a respite but the real problem to solve was getting him to the hospital. Both of you ignored that for your own reasons.", "EDITED: NTA\n\n*Previous reply:*\n\n*She may need a break, but putting your health in danger by having her watch her sick kids isn't the way to go (but ESH because you weren't thinking about your health, you were just thinking about how much you don't like kids).*\n\n*I don't like kids either, but I help my sister out with hers when I visit her across the country.*\n\n*Would I risk exposure to something that would make me really sick to watch them? No.*\n\n*Would I volunteer to take the husband to the ER myself to make sure he gets seen? 100%*\n\nREVISED ADDITION: I forgot that you mention that you have never watched young children and don't know how to change a diaper. **Five** children is a massive load, and asking to be responsible for **three** that need diapers is irresponsible of your sister to ask.", "You sound exhausting. Being child free isn't a personality trait and that doesn't mean that you can't help for once when it's a literal emergency.

Plus, if you don't have a relationship with her, then why would you take on such a huge burden. Kids are nasty and crazy especially when sick.
