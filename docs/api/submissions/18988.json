She said she doesn\u2019t want to bother mil and they can\u2019t afford an ambulance. So I asked why she\u2019s ok with burdening me to watch five sick kids but asking mil to just drive him is too much? She said she was sick too and needed a break. I hung up and moved on with my day. \n\nOur mom, who lives across the country, called me to chew me out for not watching my sisters kids. I feel like it\u2019s such an unreasonable request, I\u2019ve never even babysat one child, or even changed a diaper. How would I manage five sick kids, three of which are still in diapers? Sisters mother in law ended up taking her son to the er, and my sister has been whining to anyone who will listen about how much I suck.

Alternatively, an ambulance as you suggested. Sure, an ambulance costs money, but so does missing a week of work and your medical bills when you catch this. \n\nPutting yourself in the line of fire for the same sickness makes no sense.", "NTA! Not your responsibility", "If I watched 5 sick kids, then got sick and missed a week of work, I'd probably get fired or not be able to pay my bills.  Cannot afford to get sick in the good ol' USA.  NTA. I guess you could have offered to be the driver, but she would have still been upset that you didn't watch the kids.", "NTA, Why does she want to leave you with her kids if you know you don\u2019t have a great relationship? Also, the problem with having someone watch her kids while she takes her husband to the ER is that the person watching her kids will obviously get sick as well. You gave her two viable options. He could have called a cab too. Not very nice of her to start a phone tree about you after the fact. I get her being mad in the moment but like was said all 5 of her kids were sick so it\u2019s not like she asked you to keep 5 healthy kids at bay for a couple of hours.", "NTA.  They are all extremely contagious, the smartest thing would be to provide transport to the adult who should know what needs to be done to prevent spreading the virus.  Asking you to go look after children that you have no experience looking after in such a situation is just asking for you to get the virus too.", "NTA\n\nYou say you don\u2019t really have any relationship with her or her kids.  \n\nShe wanted a break from the sick kids\u2026. Meanwhile you would be at risk of catching their virus.", "NTA. If this was one of those \"I'm child free and there was a family emergency but I just wanted to watch netflix and chill\" then you'd probably be the AH. But given the circumstances, that a) you aren't close to your sister emotionally, and b) they're SICK with a highly contagious  virus (that is sending one of them to the ER no less) I really don't think you're an asshole for turning that down. Maybe you could have been nicer about it.\n\nBut as parents of 5 kids I feel like they need to already have a plan in place for what to do in an emergency, as well as designated people who have accepted such a responsibility they can count on to watch their kids. Also if they can't afford an ambulance they probably can't afford the ER, might as well have footed the extra bill. There's lots of programs in place to help people reduce extreme bills.", "NTA.", "I\u2019d normally say helping family is the priority, but they have the norovirus! Anyone who\u2019s had that sucker knows it is *no joke.* This has nothing to do with being child free - entering that house pretty much guarantees you catching it, too. It\u2019s hard for anyone to get sick, but a single person living away from home with no other support system to nurse you? You would be in for a hell of a week or two by yourself.\n\nSister had another viable option for help - it makes more sense for his mother to take him than for anyone else to enter the house and get further exposed to the virus. I understand sister being scared and frustrated, but she is lacking the very empathy she wanted in this situation. \n\nBut fair warning: if you don\u2019t help in their emergencies, you can\u2019t expect help in return during your own emergencies. You\u2019ve set the tone for the relationship now, for good or for ill.\n\nNTA", "NTA I feel like she should have know that you don\u2019t want or have experience with kids especially some being so young and need more intensive care than others, I feel like if she distanced herself from you but still expects you to watch her kids is weird you are grown not her little sister she can boss around anymore. She should have called family that knows those kids and has been with those kids long enough to know some what of how to take care of them. Especially with an ER trip cause those can take so long and leaving someone with no child experience could be dangerous", "NTA \n\nWhere's your violin?\n\nHold your ground. There are a lot of AHs in the world and your sister, along with those who are taking her side, are all AHs. Your own health matters and you would probably get very sick, too. I hate it when other people want to share their germs.", "NTA I think you and your sister could\u2019ve worked around not being around the kids. I\u2019m not too sure why mil couldn\u2019t drive her husband.

Your recommendation was reasonable. Asking someone inexperienced with kids to take care of five sick kids is irresponsible.", "NTA", "Uhh, why couldn't the adult man take himself to the hospital if the situation wasn't serious enough to call an ambulance? I get that it's never fun to be in the hospital by yourself, but sometimes it has to be that way. \n\nAlso, norovirus is highly contagious and it's a big ask to have anyone look after children that are sick. Much less someone who has zero experience looking after children even when they're healthy. \n\nNTA. I would have offered to mask up and drive him to the hospital before caring for five kids with norovirus.", "Nta you need more than five persons to take care of five kids for a week. The answer to this problem is other.", "ESH. I wouldn't have agreed to manage 5 kids/infants that I had no experience or relationship with either, but the real issue here is your BIL's health.  Your sister was more focused on getting away from the kids as a respite but the real problem to solve was getting him to the hospital. Both of you ignored that for your own reasons.", "EDITED: NTA\n\n*Previous reply:*\n\n*She may need a break, but putting your health in danger by having her watch her sick kids isn't the way to go (but ESH because you weren't thinking about your health, you were just thinking about how much you don't like kids).*\n\n*I don't like kids either, but I help my sister out with hers when I visit her across the country.*\n\n*Would I risk exposure to something that would make me really sick to watch them? No.*\n\n*Would I volunteer to take the husband to the ER myself to make sure he gets seen? 100%*\n\nREVISED ADDITION: I forgot that you mention that you have never watched young children and don't know how to change a diaper. **Five** children is a massive load, and asking to be responsible for **three** that need diapers is irresponsible of your sister to ask.", "You sound exhausting. Being child free isn't a personality trait and that doesn't mean that you can't help for once when it's a literal emergency. If I were the rest of your family, I definitely wouldn't be wanting to move heaven and earth with your attitude.", "NTA bc if something happened to one of those kids, it would be your fault. Plus, if you don't have a relationship with her, then why would you take on such a huge burden. Kids are nasty and crazy especially when sick. I was 1 of 4 growing up and we would have destroyed you with how wild we were. We were not something 1 person could deal with. Surely your sister has friends", "I'm reading one selfish excuse after another.

We got norovirus in my household of 5 and I would do just about anything to avoid it again. It\u2019s up there with HFMD. NTA, especially if you\u2019ve never changed a diaper. Changing a norovirus poop diaper? HELL NO.", "Watching sick kids you don\u2019t know would be an absolute nightmare for everyone involved.", "I don\u2019t know why any parent would want someone who doesn\u2019t know or like kids to watch theirs? And personally, if I had an extremely contagious illness, I wouldn\u2019t want to expose anyone (but especially anyone I love) to it.", "Seriously!!", "But that's not what OP brought up.", "An ambulance costs a life ruining amount so don't act like it's no big deal to call one", "I agree but offering to be the driver? No! The husband is super sick!", "Apparently, according to a comment OP said the sister only calls when she wants something.", "Right, cause with family like this who needs strangers.", "Only one person in this scenario is in any way obliged to do something about that though. And it\u2019s not OP.", "NTA is my position. I agree with this post basically; the real issue is the BIL's health. Sounds like sister was hoping for a free babysitter to get some time away from 5 sick kids. She probably could use a break, but it sounds like none of them have much of a healthy relationship with OP and shouldn't be expecting OP to be their hero. Expecting OP to risk her health to care for kids that she doesn't know how to care for seems super unreasonable. BIL needs emergency medical care but OP can't provide that and isn't needed to get him the care he needs.", "I think OP was more focused on the fact that she didn't know how to take care of kids, especially sick kids. That's why I'd say NTA.", "Yeah I\u2019m not exposing myself to the norovirus for any reason, that\u2019s insane to ask of anyone.", "Here's the thing, if you're taking care of 5 young kids with Norovirus, you're pretty much guaranteed to get Norovirus. OP also has never taken care of kids before. Going from absolutely zero experience with kids to watching 5 young kids all at once, let alone five *sick* kids, let alone 5 sick kids when you're definitely going to get sick yourself (Norovirus has a super fast incubation period of 12-48 hours) is straight up unsafe for everyone involved", "I agree that she sounds exhausting, but she's not the AH for not wanting to watch five sick kids, three of them in diapers, when she has absolutely no experience with kids.  Also, I'm sure she has no desire to catch norovirus.  This was a completely unreasonable ask from her sister.", "How is it NOT a \"personality trait\"? One without offspring can either see themselves as Childless or Childfree.", "Some people make it their personality", "A literal emergency has a literal number: 911. \n\nAin't nobody got money for an ambulance. But if it's a literal emergency, that's what they're there for.", "Op has never cared for sick children. Second it made more since for mil to drive her son and the op sister stay with 5 sick kids. Sick kids tend to want to be with thier mom. \n\nPlus I don\u2019t think I f I was op, unless they where my kids or grandkids, would walk into a home where it\u2019s 100 percent likely your going to get sick.", "I wouldn\u2019t ask her for help for anything, she\u2019s already made it clear that she won\u2019t help me if I need it. Hence why I said no here", "The way I read it was the MIL was sick and needed a break", "She asked why they didn\u2019t care to burden Mil but didn\u2019t mind doing it to her. Then she said she\u2019s sick too and needs a break. That means MIL is sick and need a break.", "That is my take, too.  OP response was, \"Anything but me helping you in any way.\"  (One could also infer a \"GFY for even being in need of help.\")", "So OP can catch what they have and be sick, too?", "Doesn't sound like OP considers sis family and I doubt she would call them in an emergency anyway. Relationships go two ways and neither sister seems to want one.", "i don't think they'd have found a sitter willing to take on 5 kids, 3 who are not toilet trained yet, with norovirus.", "Oh, TOTALLY!!", "I think that\u2019s it though. They didn\u2019t want to get MIL sick. But that same concern didn\u2019t extend to OP.", "Me, either!", "Sort of did - all 5 kids had the virus so OP could have caught it.", "Seriously?", "Agree about the obligations here, but I think OP is an AH for how they handled it (wasn't clear on that in my original comment), between their phrasing and their invocation of not having any help moving into college. Makes me think at this point, any family interaction is purely transactional. Maybe it's deserved - many of us have really shitty families and some traumatic origin stories - but given that it's only the context of this post, I felt that ESH.", "I agree with you!", "Good point! I totally forgot about that part when I was writing my comment. She mentions not knowing how to change diapers and the fact that **3** of the **5** are in diapers. Oh man, changing my ruling!", "It is more of a demographic category (age, profession, etc.) than a personality trait (clever, intense, etc.)", "There is a huge difference between childless or child-free and expressing the desire to never be around children. Children are around no matter what. Op chooses not relationship because she has made child-free a part of her personality. \n\nI have two ex BIL's like this. Both were married to my SIL. One even asked me to \"put my kids up\" while at my home (uninvited) like I could send them to their kennels or something. They were simply playing in the yard of their home. I sent him home instead and he was seriously angry about it. The other one just pretended like we didn't have kids. He would do things like \"forget\" that they needed to eat at events he invited the family to (including the kids then he would forget to have enough food for them) or try to get them to sit outside or in another room at holidays and at one point, their dad's birthday party.", "Then help out in another way.  OP could have offered to drive the husband to the ER.  She has pretty much told her sister that she does not give one single flying F about her or her family.\n\nThe guy could be laying on the ground and bleeding out from an injury and OP wouldn\u2019t help because she felt slighted in the past.", "it\u2019s more the attitude, the reasons given, and lack of care being shown that makes them the ah.", "That sounds like a pretty immature attitude.  She turned you down on that one occasion, but maybe she actually had a really good reason to do so.  You may not think it was a good reason, but it may have been very valid indeed.  You make it sound as if she just told you no and blew you off for no reason, but maybe she had a long standing appointment for that day that she could not reschedule.", "You have your parents to help you move into your college dorm. That's the parent thing to do. \n\nHelping her kids in an emergency to take her husband to the ER and not helping you move into your college dorm aren't the same situation at all.", "their attitude is gross. i\u2019d understand not wanting to catch it, but they are not sorry or remorseful of the situation, and don\u2019t wanna watch them bc they don\u2019t like being around kids. there was no mention of not wanting to get sick. they literally said since their sister had kids they stopped having a relationship with her\u2026 they come across as a selfish ah.", "OP could have worn a mask and washed hands.", "I never thought of it that way! So true!", "I don\u2019t think you got the point of my reply.", "Considering the sister told op she needed a break and wanted op to watch the kids I don\u2019t think the sister would have let op take the husband even if she offered too.", "The husband has the Norovirus so bad he's going to the hospital! OP would probably get sick, too. It can be deadly, you know.", "Yes but it was the sister saying I just need a break from sick kids that made me think op was not the asshole.\n\nThe fact is by letting the mil take the hubby. Mil is she took precautions probably doesn\u2019t have as high of a risk of op would by going to the house and cleaning and changing kids.", "I posted her reasoning and my experience in another comment.", "My parents were out of town for the month and I didn\u2019t have a car, that\u2019s why I asked her. She refused because she wanted to enjoy her weekend off work. Instead I had to get help from some really creepy guy I worked with who hit on me the whole time and asked for a reward after", "I was ten when she had her first kid. She dropped me, I didn\u2019t drop her.", "Doesn't help as much as you think.", "Then please explain. Because I took it as you don't agree with my opinion.", "Yeah.  OP is right for just hanging up on her family in need and telling them to figure everything out for themselves and not to bother her. /s\n\nI\u2019m not saying it would have been a pleasant job or even without risk.  But if I\u2019m in the sister\u2019s situation and got the attitude that I got from OP, then OP better not EVER come to me for anything for the rest of her life.  Homeless?  Don\u2019t care.  Go sleep on somebody else\u2019s steps.  You declared that I cannot count on you in even a medical emergency.  You\u2019re as good as just calling a random stranger off the street at that point.", "so it would be better for MIL to get sick instead?", "if she showed any empathy for her literal family being so horribly sick, and her bil needing emergency healthcare, i would think differently. it\u2019s fine to not wanna look after sick kids, but if your family need help, anyone who isn\u2019t an ah would try help them out, even if that means suggesting another solution that doesn\u2019t involve you \u2014 but she hung up on her sister. she\u2019s being petty in the replies and clearly doesn\u2019t care about her family, all of which makes her the ah.", "You\u2019re still an AH who is immature and holds grudges.  Grow up.", "Sure Jan.", "So did you just think her kids/husband wouldn't be a priority. You also seem to have an age difference and were at very different points in your life.", "ok, your attitude is still gross.", "And you are holding a grudge like you still are 10.", "And yet plenty of medical professionals handled it during the pandemic.", "Most people don't.", "From what I've read, the feeling has been mutual for years now and the sister only calls OP when she needs something.", "She's related to him more than OP! And maybe she'll be the one to say \"No way! I'm calling you an ambulance right now and I'll help pay for it!\"\n\nI mean, with 5 kids, you'd think they'd have insurance and if not, his family and the rest of hers could help pay.", "She could\u2019ve chose to have a relationship with her siblings despite getting married and having kids, she just didn\u2019t want to. She only calls me when she wants something now", "I mean, damage was done to our relationship and she never bothered to repair it. I\u2019ve moved on and made peace that I don\u2019t have a sister anymore. She only calls if she wants something. I wish she would just leave me alone", "I AM a medical professional and a bunch of us still got Covid even though we wore the best masks and took extra precautions.", "I don't care, tbh. We're all entitled to our opinions here on AITA because that's the fun of it! I've been on AITA long enough to know that it's fine. Doesn't bother me! :-)", "That is OP\u2019s side of the story.  The sister may very well have a completely different story and likely does considering OP\u2019s immature attitude.", "You aren't interested in her kids, so why would she have a relationship with you? It's not like she can set them aside to spend time with you whenever she wants. You don't want the kids around and she has kids. It sounds like YOU chose the limited relationship out of spite.", "And was your attitude just as gross as OPs in an emergency situation too?", "But we're being asked to judge OP's story. Until the sister posts here, this is what we have. :-)", "Yeah I\u2019m sure the side of someone who wants their sister to risk getting norovirus for her convenience is super reasonable.", "I have friends who have children. They have lives and friends outside of their children. It can be done.", "I don't work in emergency. But if it was a true emergency, an ambulance would have been necessary instead. And to call my attitude \"gross\" isn't very nice at all. We are all entitled to our opinions in our comments but we're required to be civil.", "And that is exactly what I\u2019m doing.  I judged her TA.  She felt slighted a few years ago and has been holding a grudge determined not to help her sister no matter how much she might be in need.  Yeah, technically she doesn\u2019t have to help her own sister, but not doing so in an emergency is an AH thing to do.", "Do you ask your sister to do things with you? She has five small children, three in diapers. A babysitter is a ton of money and I am sure when she does get a sitter she uses that time to be alone with her husband for a date night or to even have some time to herself.", "I guess we should agree to disagree, then. Ahhh, the fun of AITA! Thanks for being so nice about it. You disagreed without insulting me and being mean and rude. I appreciate that. :-)", "That may all be true but then why does OP's sister expect her to drop everything to care for children she doesn't know when they have no relationship, no mater whose fault it is?"]}
