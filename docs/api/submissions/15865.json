Sorry the setup is a bit long.   \n   \nI (36F) share my wonderful daughter 'Hazel' (12F) with my ex 'Alrick' (37M). He's been in and out of her life since she was a baby; he pays child support, but gave me full custody and doesn't have any set schedule for seeing her. He works as a long distance trucker (owner-operator), so he's all over the country for work and Hazel only gets to see him in person a few times a year. Normally, she really looks forwards to seeing him, which is why this current situation hurts so much.   \n   \nAlrick's taken her on holiday before; over Christmas, he wanted to have her for a week, and took her to visit a city on the other side of the country. She spent a long time researching the place; things she wanted to see and do; only to come back to me in tears. Turns out, he spent most of the days talking to some of his clients and arranging future work, and left her in to her own devices in the hotel room with some money and instructions to not go outside the local area in the city. On the fourth day, she'd had enough and caught the bus to go visit a museum she really wanted to see; he got back before she did and worried, they had a big fight, and she was grounded for the remainder of the trip.   \n   \nI've talked to her about not running off like that, but I also think he was wrong for leaving her like that and told him as much (not in front of her). He promised me he'd do better, and Hazel he'd drop in over easter and take her on a better trip to make up for it. Except he hasn't, and after weeks of radio silence, he texted me this week to admit he won't be in town for another two months and even then it's only a maybe. Hazel didn't take it well, obviously; she thinks it's her fault he doesn't want to see her, because she ran off.   \n   \nOn the spot I did my best to comfort her, but there's only so many times she's willing to trust me when I say her dad needs to work. So I told her gently that her dad's not avoiding her, and it's not her fault, he's just busy and he forgets to think of others sometimes. But she wanted to know when he'd be back, and all I could tell her was maybe two months, I don't know. She seemed as okay as she could be afterwards, and I've been trying to make things up to her as best I can without my ex.    \n   \nBut today, I got a call out of the blue from Alrick's mother of all people, absolutely chewing me out for what I said. Apparently she's been texting Hazel, who told her what I said, and now she blames me for throwing her son under the bus and bad-mouthing him to our daughter because I said he doesn't always think of others' feelings. I've had a long angry text from Alrick himelf since, saying the same, and it's making me worry I said something I shouldn't have.", "created_utc": 1682636577, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/131af6h/aita_for_telling_my_daughter_her_dad_doesnt/", "score": 72, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My Mother was always honest as possible with me about my Father. Starting with something similar to what you told her. As I got older, she slowly told me more and more truths. I will forever be thankful to that woman for never letting me think it\u2019s my own fault. She is the only reason I have accepted my Father for who he is and we still have contact. \n\nIt is not fair to your Daughter for her to be waiting around and hoping when he knows damn well he can\u2019t make it!", "NTA deadbeat and deadbeat's mom are mad you called a deadbeat a deadbeat. The only other option you had is to lie to your daughter and give her false hope only for her dad to disappoint her again.\n\nSidenote, something like what her dad did is similar to what the last straw for me with my dad was. He strongarmed my mom into letting him have me for one week of my 2 week spring break and then he was working the whole time except for one day where we went to the park for a couple hours. I was like \"He didn't actually want to do anything with me, he just wanted me for the sake of having me.\" I was about the same age as your daughter and there was no court order, only a mutual agreement between my parents so I just stopped going.\n\nDon't make any excuses for this guy, I know first hand what it's like to be jerked around by a parent who doesn't actually care and it's awful.\n\nEdit: Someone else said ESH and I'm going to have to agree, this guy left your twelve year old daughter to roam an unknown city by herself, you should not let him have any unsupervised visitation with your daughter and DEFINITELY don't let him take her on another vacation.", "NTA how often does grandma come visit? Tell her she raised a son with shit priorities.", "NTA. She\u2019s 12 now and getting her own views of him despite the candy coating you\u2019ve applied previously. You didn\u2019t flat out say \u201cyour dad sucks and because he continues to break promises and hurt you he\u2019ll never get better because he\u2019s a selfish prick\u201d. You gave a 12yo an age appropriate explanation of why her father is hurting her emotionally.", "NTA\n\nYou told your daughter the truth without actually bashing her dad or saying anything overly hateful or spiteful. The truth hurts sometimes and the truth isn't always enjoyable to hear but it's important because truth is what reality is based on.", "Not sure who I feel worse for Hazel or you.... You\u2019re definitely NTA. No one would want to be the person who is responsible for continually delivering disappointing news. Of all the things you could say that was probably the most kind. You did the best you could with the problem your ex created. You were being a good Mom.\n\nThe truth hurts sometimes... especially for those who it applies to. Alrick & his mother need to grow the hell up & think about your little girl instead of themself. His decisions are not your failure. That\u2019s on him.", "NTA. You generally don't want to badmouth an ex to your kid. But his abandonment of her without communication was causing her to feel that she was the one who caused it. She had to know that she was the victim of neglect, not the cause of it. \n\nIf Alrick's mother had better ways of expressing things in order to preserve the image of her son, why didn't she text those to her BEFORE you had to explain? If Alrick's so good at contacting you regarding his hurt feelings, why wasn't he good at contacting her to keep her informed of his life and his plans to see her?", "NTA - your ex is a piece of work, telling her he\u2019s not considerate of her will set her up well for the future.", "NTA you said the truth. That was a crap trip and he is full of crap excuses. He isn\u2019t thinking of her.", "NTA. Your 12yo daughter is hurting, and you only told her the truth to comfort her. Honestly, most of us don't always think of others' feelings. Alrick should apologize to her and reassure her that he is busy with work and there is nothing she did that is making him not see her (rather than sending you angry texts).", "Your daughter is nearly a teenager. She needs validation from you that her dad is acting shitty. Be honest with her. Let her make her own decisions on whether she wants to see her father and encourage her not to. He's dangerous and treating her like shit.\n\nIt's not parental alienation if he's the one alienating her.\n\nNTA", "She's 12 - I remember I was pretty aware at that age and could tell when I was being placated. You tried to gloss things over but it gets to a point when that doesn't fly anymore. \n\nHe took a child to a different city on vacation and she spent the majority of that time on her own in a hotel room. He doesn't provide her with any set dates that she can rely on so all their time together is ad hoc. He makes promises and when he can't deliver, instead of contacting her in advance, he goes radio silent for two months. Then, that disappointment falls on you to explain and smooth over. \n\nYou're NTA and his mother had made no effort to see things from your point of view or that of your daughter's, only his. You didn't bad mouth him, you offered a morsel of honesty - yes he's busy with work, yes he neglects to think of others during those times. Nothing that isn't already very obvious.", "NTA. It\u2019s not your job to lie to protect his feelings at your daughters expense. If he wants to ge spoken of as someone who cares about other people, he should behave that way.", "Um NTA- he sounds like he should be lucky you allow him to see her because you have full custody. She\u2019s going to realize in the end the truth anyways.", "NTA. Your daughter doesn't deserve to be left in the lurch constantly having certain expectations and being let down. That is entirely on your ex. You aren't badmouthing him, you're actually letting her down as gently as possible while trying to excuse his behavior for something that is his fault. He isn't making the effort.", "NTA\n\nIf the shoe fits ...", "ESH - Stop sugar coating or covering for him, but don't talk shit.   \nShe is old enough to form her own opinion of dad.", "ESH\n\nHe was a really selfish guy, to leave a twelve year old in a hotel with nothing to do all day and no supervision. With instructions to \"only\" wander the nearby parts of the city. For days. That's irresponsible. And cruel, considering how much she looked forward to it. But the irresponsibility is the highlight here. \n\nI wouldn't let my kid go with someone who let my twelve year old wander off in a strange city. \n\nYou must know by now that he's not a responsible parent. He emotionally damages your child, gaslights her, and neglects her. And yet you encourage her to spend time with him? When you have full custody? Why?", "NTA\n\nHowever, it might go more smoothly if you blame it on his job, which is unpredictable, rather than making it a judgment about him.  \"Your dad's job has very irregular hours, and requires him to be away a lot, and neither he nor I can control where it will take him.  If he says he wants to do something with you, while he may genuinely want to do it, he may not be able to. As you know from experience.  I am not going to promise you that he'll be able to follow through with any plans he makes.\"", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She did indeed receive a below average solo vacation.", "NTA\n\nHas her dad ever completely kept a promise?", "NTA. Your ex is dropping the ball. His mom is enabling him, something she has probably always done. When kids are looking for an explanation, you don't dare lie or your credibility is gone. The only way you could have saved yourself was to reply, \"ask your father\", but that would be a cop out.\n\nTBH, he is caught up in his grown up world where his little girl's concerns are not on his radar. I would tell him that if he cannot step up as a father then don't bother coming around your little girl any more. Promising the sky and delivering less than nothing is breaking her heart. He has to stop being a coward and tell his daughter the uncomfortable truths instead of making you the bad guy. When they are together, if he cannot give his daughter his undivided attention, he is not being a dad. He is being a huge disappointment.\n\nI would recommend therapy for your daughter, if you are not already doing so. Your ex is failing her and the therapist may be able to explain her dad's negligence. Then you can concentrate on just being supportive when your ex fails time and again. It will be several years yet before your daughter is ready to understand and accept that some people don't make good choices in life, even when they are parents.", "NTA, it shouldn't be your job to always have to pick up the emotional mess he makes.", "NTA - Sounds like you've been a decent human to him and her. \n\nHe and exMIL needs to own he does not follow through on commitments & his daughter is not a priority based on his actions. Say this to them. Instead they deflect the truth by jumping on you but truth is, he frequently does not think of others. He created this track record, not you.\n\nHis daughter is going to age and create her life. A man who runs his own business can surely carve out one 5-day weekend a year to spend the entire time with his daughter; no side jobs. It is pathetic this is not occurring and it yes, \"...hurts so much.\"  Dad if you are reading this, time is passing you by to demonstrate you are reliable, you love her and you value her. Best to you OP.", "NTA, but I don\u2019t think he really is either. He gave up custody, he\u2019s paying, and his work doesn\u2019t really allow for consistency visiting. He\u2019s definitely not trying very hard, but he is doing something and she\u2019s still too young to really understand.\n\nIf anyone is the AH, it\u2019s the paternal grandma.

If Alrick doesn't want to be called inconsiderate he should... try considering his daughter's feelings.", "Definitely NTA. You were being honest with your child which is much better than lying to her or allowing her to continue thinking it\u2019s her fault! It makes him look bad because it is bad!

He\u2019s hurting her but she\u2019s learning she can depend upon you.", "NTA\n\nBut stop making excuses for his shitty behavior. Your teaching your daughter that this is how men show their love. \n\nDoesn\u2019t make seeing her a priority. Ignores her to work.

He has constantly put work above his own daughter and now he's upset because he is being called out on it.\n My husband is a truck driver and I have a really good understanding on how it all works. Being an owner-op, unless he is leasing his truck to a company, he can pick and choose his loads. When, where what he wants to do. It's a benefit to owning your own truck. If he truly wanted to make time he could. I understand it can be harder going cross country it can be harder but it's not impossible.  \nRight now my husband is a company driver and is home every night because he wants to be with me and the kids. It's a choice. Im so sorry your ex is being an absolute jerk to your daughter.  She doesn't deserve this. She didn't do anything to make him not see her. You also didn't say anything wrong. \nSome truck drivers will spend their lives chasing the almighty dollar. My husband's father was one of them. He didn't see him for 33 years. He picked the road over his son. \nMy husband choose not to be like his father and they have no relationship. \nMaybe a therapist might be something to just consider. You don't want your daughter to blame herself for her dad not being there. I've seen what that can do and she doesn't deserve that.\nYour doing a great job. Just keep being there for her.", "NTA I was 12 when I started to realize just how horrible my father\u2019s behavior truly was. Part of it was because he left and I saw that life could actually be peaceful without walking on eggshells for him, but my age played a huge part in it too. She was justifiably hurt by his atrocious behavior on her visit and letting her continue to blame herself wouldn\u2019t have been good parenting.
