Your comment was spot on. Don't listen to those who tell you to be nice and turn the other cheek.  \n\nOur world is full of assholes precisely because we, as a culture, coddle and support rude and judgemental idiots. This idiot started it.  You ended it.  \n\nCalling him out as a parent was completely appropriate.  He was actively teaching his son to behave towards others in that way.  You were doing the right thing.  Hopefully, it made his son consider orhers feelings. Or will when he's older.\n\nWhen one of us speaks out, we speak not just for ourselves but for others like us.  As someone with an invisible disability that necessitates a disabled parking placard, I get attitude and judgment. Thank you for standing up for me.", "Not at all, not all disabilities are visible.

I also feel like I need to look demonstrably frail when getting out of the car into the chair, even though I'm perfectly able to walk a few steps (I don't need my chair around my house), I'm just unable to walk any distance without it depleting all of my energy for the day and probably the next several days as well in recovery.", "He made a stupid remark.
