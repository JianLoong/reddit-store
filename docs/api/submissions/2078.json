The kids will be traumatized if he can't handle them.\n\nNext time you are sick, tell him to pack the kids swimwear, and go to a hotel!

It just makes sense.", "Before you have that adult talk about parenting responsibilities, think back to any times your husband was sick, how he acted and what treatment he asked you to provide.

Oh, NTA. \n\nIf it lends you ammo, my husband did all our twins' night feedings and remained Parent of Choice in the night, as he woke up better than I did.

This is not because my wife is under involved or not a great parent. It\u2019s simply that children are creatures of habit.

Twice when our kids were small and I had a temp of over 103\u00baF , he left me alone with them to go to parties. He said caring for them wasn't that much work. (We're talking infants and toddlers.) Of course, when *he* was sick, he needed constant care. \n\nWhen the kids got older, he also blamed me because when he asked how school went, they'd say, \"OK,\" and little else, whereas I got the full report. I tried to tell him if he spent a little time with them, they'd open up more, but he said the only way he'd do that was if they helped with the garden, his passion.

Just stop doing stuff when you need to. It's his job too, he needs to step up.\n\nA word of advice though. Once he does start to parent more actively, he'll do things a bit differently to you. That can be irritating when you're more experienced and have got most things worked out. But it's important that you let him figure some stuff out.

While watching the news one evening, a reporter said the Drs in the local medical center, a small city like area with many different hospitals, had decided to study Zinc, to SEE WHY so many people were going nuts about zinc lozenges. They learned that viruses, once they come in contact with zinc, cannot replicate. That was the fall of 1997. I also experienced this wonderful: get well quickly using zinc lozenges, where sore throat was better in only hours! Not sure if you noticed: but zinc lozenges were nearly IMPOSSIBLE to find around the time lockdown went into place. So A LOT OF PEOPLE KNEW THIS! I finally found some, and drove 45 minutes to get them, for family who were \u201cessential\u201d workers. Later, one lung specialist in Ca explained online what he was doing to keep from getting covid: he took zinc, quercetin (lots of this in onions) because it helps open a little \u201cdoor\u201d on cells, to let zinc enter, and Vit D3 (a hormone that helps immune system work better). So, when virus arrives and tries to TAKE OVER the cell and order reproduction of itself, until cell has no more energy, zinc says: Not So Fast, and SHUTS IT DOWN! \nI LOVED the Drs who were sharing this info, so did what they said they were doing for themselves. Since I have a \u201ccompromised\u201d immune system, and already took zinc daily: When I got covid in Jan 2020, (you know you had it because you nearly cough your toenails up at that time) I had light fevers, super bad cough, and stayed in bed sick, but NOTHING LIKE so many others. I covered my cough when in public\u2026 NOTE: A family I know, who don\u2019t eat junk foods, but lots of organic foods never got sick at all.

The problem is that you have catered too long to the 3 y/o\u2026 Barring some type of disorder, like autism, or other similar, 3 y/o should have bonded with dad. With kids like this, you don\u2019t just let them do as they feel, you encourage them to MATURE a little. Ok, so they don\u2019t want dad, well dad isn\u2019t abusing the child, so WHAT is the problem. Dad should pick the child up, talk to the child, MAKE AN EFFORT to bond with the child\u2026which it seems is just not happening. \n\nA LOT of families have this problem, of all child interactions being mommy centric are because dad makes little or no effort, or gives up easily. What is dad doing? Watching the games? Drinking? Maybe dad is being selfish, instead of involving himself more with kids? There is a REASON that we have the expression: E for effort. It means you GET something back for trying. So, sometimes all you get is \u201cE\u201d not A or B, but You tried. Dad needs to put in more effort. He will first get \u201cE\u201d \u2026 later C, then B, then A.
