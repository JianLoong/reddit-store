It just makes sense.", "Before you have that adult talk about parenting responsibilities, think back to any times your husband was sick, how he acted and what treatment he asked you to provide.

Oh, NTA. \n\nIf it lends you ammo, my husband did all our twins' night feedings and remained Parent of Choice in the night, as he woke up better than I did.

This is not because my wife is under involved or not a great parent. It\u2019s simply that children are creatures of habit.

Of course, when *he* was sick, he needed constant care. \n\nWhen the kids got older, he also blamed me because when he asked how school went, they'd say, \"OK,\" and little else, whereas I got the full report. I tried to tell him if he spent a little time with them, they'd open up more, but he said the only way he'd do that was if they helped with the garden, his passion.

I can't imagine letting my son believe he did something wrong because he wants to come to me with his troubles. In the moment, being sick, I get reacting poorly.

The way I see it: it\u2019s either talk out your feelings and expectations with your SO laying clear boundaries or leave. Personally, the thought of living with someone hoping and wanting them to get better but never talking about my expectations or needs makes me feel claustrophobic just thinking about it.
