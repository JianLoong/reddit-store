I\u2019ve went out of my way to help pick her up her crutches, order her food/cook for her, pick up her deliveries and clean up after her. \nI was there to cheer her up when she got upset about her injury and started to cry. We were super close friends, that is I really consider her as a close sister than friend. \n\nHowever yesterday, she invited her friend to our place, and asked if I want to order something from the same restaurant they are gonna order. I said yes, and ordered a tomyum soup, and offered for pick up. But I was still at the office, knowing I won\u2019t be back till 7, her friend picked up for us. \n\nAnd on my way home, she texted me that they actually ate up my soup, that there was nothing left. Didn\u2019t know how to react, (I honestly was in disbelief, thought she was joking) and after confirming that they really did, I said I\u2019m good, just gonna heat up some food in the fridge. And she insist to order another tomyum soup, I said no please, she said she already ordered.\n\nThen when I came back home, feeling upset abt the forced generosity, I didn\u2019t laugh when they explain abt how they ended up finishing my food, that the soup was great I should try it when it arrives( I honestly couldn\u2019t care less) \nThen when her friend abt to head out, the order finally arrived, she asked me to pick it up, laughing as if it\u2019s something funny\ud83e\udee0\nHer friend asked if there\u2019s anything they can do, she said it\u2019s okay just put their used dishes in the sink.\n\nAnd guess what, playing the \u201cpoor me \u201ccard, I will have to clean up their shit.\n\nI figured that I just can\u2019t take it anymore, asked her to clean up her stuff while I clean up the piled up garbage mountain(we haven\u2019t been able to clean them regularly bc I am off work most of the time as it piles up. And I cleaned it up literally 3 days ago. \nAnd she act as if she is in great pain while cleaning up stuff, I said, you are making me uncomfortable, and she answered: \u201cthat\u2019s the point!\u201d \n\nI put that bag of tomyum soup that arrived late to her fridge section, and refused to drink it when she offered to heat it up for me. (I said no thanks, and again the forced generosity\u2026 she said she already heated up for me smh) and I just left it on the table.\n\nthis whole thing just makes me so so uncomfortable that I simply can\u2019t bear to spend time with her in the same house anymore. I want to try spend most of my time at my friends place or just find a cafe shop and get home as late as I can lol.

Yes I am a bit shocked she needs crutches for it but she'll live. Now if she broke the foot itself or the ankle I could see a little bit of assistance. She can ask them to clean their own dishes and/or she can stand on one leg to do the dishes.\n\nI hope you told her clearly you don't like the forced generosity and would appreciate it if she would stop.

She\u2019s gotten used to you helping around and unfortunately in certain scenarios she\u2019s going to act like she\u2019s always in pain or there\u2019s something wrong with her constantly so that you feel bad and do things for her.

It sounds like she's either a complete wimp with no nous, or simply someone doing everything to take advantage of your assistance. \n\nUnless she's got another issue that you've not mentioned, she could stand at the sink putting weight on her good foot for the time it takes to wash up the dishes - after all, it was two people eating something ordered in, it wasn't a banquet. And as for cleaning up after herself, if it is too much effort for her she could minimise the mess to begin with.", "NTA - a broken toe isn\u2019t comfortable but it\u2019s not like she broke her foot/ankle/leg.

I broke my toe on my 13th birthday and performed in a karate demonstration the next day where I broke a board with that foot. It\u2019s fine. No crutches needed, no whining.

They ate your food, made a joke out of it, never did listen to what YOU wanted, then kept making more jokes out of it. They\u2019re terrible.", "I\u2019ll get downvotes but YTA. You got bent out of shape because they ate the food they ordered for you & immediately replaced it. I don\u2019t understand why you got upset? It would be totally understandable if they ate it & didn\u2019t replace it. And then you let that upset ruin your whole evening.", "I honestly was thinking the same as I also got swollen ankles and I still do things myself.

A broken toe has been worse than recovering from a shoulder surgery\u2026 yep.", "My mom broke her toe when we were on holiday in mexico and it healed on its own didn\u2019t even need crutches just open toed shoes for a bit lol", "This is a dumb thing to say, I currently have a broken big toe that is swells to the size of a golf ball if it\u2019s not elevated above my heart. They gave me a wheelchair for it and yeah, I feel stupid, but no way I could walk or do anything for myself right now as I can feel my throbbing aching heartbeat in it when it goes below my waist. The whole foot is swollen and weird", "I kept judging myself on how small hearted I sounded, refusing to help someone for just some Thai food.

She probably appreciates her friends coming over to see her more than me", "I broke my toe and am in a wheelchair for 6-8 weeks and every time my foot goes below level with my heart is swells uncontrollably.

It\u2019s swollen and painful first 2-3 days then its gonna be better. Don\u2019t let her treat you like her servant. She can do stuff. If i was able to walk to the hospital she should be able to clean up after herself", "My son had a broken toe and didn\u2019t need crutches. He was also expected to clean up after himself. He was off the hook for some chores like taking the dogs out or taking the trash cans to the street, as it\u2019s a long, steep driveway. But he still took his dirty dishes to the sink, and was perfectly fine loading the dishwasher, and other light chores. Your roommate is taking advantage of your goodwill and generosity.\n\nNTA.", "ESH I think everyone in this comment section is giving you leniency because they assume a broken toe is nothing serious. Well there are many ways to break a toe and varying degrees of seriousness, when a family member of mine broke theirs they could barely walk, and the pain was immense for the first 2-3 months or so. \n\n\nSo with that out of the way, it's nice that you have been helping your friend through their injury. I think you overreacted with the soup situation, especially since they offered to buy it for you, twice.\n\nThe reason your roommate is an asshole is because she solely relying on you to get shit done, and even putting the burden of hospitality on to you. That's very unfair, you are not her mom. Overall this makes her a bigger AH, I would suggest you establish some boundaries and explain to her that her guests are her responsibility and it's not ok to pass the burden on to you.", "She's milking this broken toe shit, don't stand for it. She can hobble over to the sink and do her own dishes, hobble to the bin and discard of her own rubbish. She's treating you like shit and sounds manipulative. \n\nNTA", "ESH.  Your roommate has accepted your assistance and been darned unappreciative of it.  Now, her supposed efforts to return your kindness by ordering replacement soup and then heating it up seem almost mocking. She has her friend over but doesn\u2019t even ask her friend to wash their dirty dishes or take out the trash. You\u2019re going a bit too far if you refuse to do *anything* around the apartment but what \u201chelp\u201d does she really need at this point?  She doesn\u2019t *need* help to order food delivery or to get herself a glass of water with which to take her pain medication. tbh, I would find her silliness and play acting quite annoying also.", "Crutches for a broken toe? Unable to do anything? Really, that\u2019s laying it a bit thick. I broke my toe and went into work, not because it didn\u2019t hurt( it did, but was okay with painkillers unless I banged it) but because it wasn\u2019t that bad. It really just needs strapping.", "NTA. It's horrible that you don't feel comfortable in your own home.", "INFO: Was it her **big** toe?", "I should really probably just Google it, but what is bouldering?", "I'm not understanding the issue. Your friend broke her toe. You helped your friend because broken toe. Friend and other friend ordered takeaway and ordered for you as well. You weren't home. They ate your takeaway before you got home, apologised and ordered more for you. You are upset about this and now can't stand to be around her.\n\nIt seems like a very big over-reaction to me. It was thoughtless of them, but friends do that sometimes. I don't think you should end your friendship over such a small thing.", "NTA. She shouldn't have consumed your order, and when she did consume it she should have ordered the soup again without even asking you and could have informed you after she had placed the order.\n\nAlso, you are not her servant. Your roommate's friend was generous and righteous to have asked if there was anything they can do but the way your roommate just left the entire work for you shows how she takes you for granted.", "NTA, all this over a broken toe, wow!   \nShe is a control freak and time for you to move.", "Yeah. I spent 2 days with a fractured arm before even going to the doctor. I even went fishing with friends lmao. It didn't swell  because the bone stayed in place so I assumed it's gonna go away in a few days.\n\nA broken toe is a joke and OPs friend just likes to play the victim. Is she doing the dishes with her feet or something?", "Yeah I read the forced \"generosity\" as less about making things up to OP and more about keeping OP at her beck and call. With, based on all the \"haha isn't this a funny joke\" attitude, possibly a side of wanting to show off how much OP would let her get away with.", "That\u2019s the big toe, though. That would definitely be a rough recovery since it\u2019s the toe that gets the most use and is used for balance. But the little toes aren\u2019t as big of a deal and usually just get taped up.", "That does sound weird, almost like there\u2019s something else going on as well. Generally toes aren\u2019t that big a deal.", "Gosh, that seems very extreme. Sorry you are experiencing so much pain.", "thanks for replying to loads of people saying this, we rlly care :)", "Depends on how bad the break is.  \n\nI broke a toe very badly- it was at about a 45 degree angle- so I had to get it set properly, and while they didn't use a cast, they taped it and put me in a walking boot.  I was given some powerful painkillers and was on crutches for a while. That was 20 years ago, and it will still ache on long downhill hikes.\n\nI was still a functional adult and washed my own dishes, though.", "The smaller toes no. The big toe is a different story."]}
