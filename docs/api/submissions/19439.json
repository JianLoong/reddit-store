We were super close friends, that is I really consider her as a close sister than friend. \n\nHowever yesterday, she invited her friend to our place, and asked if I want to order something from the same restaurant they are gonna order. I said yes, and ordered a tomyum soup, and offered for pick up. But I was still at the office, knowing I won\u2019t be back till 7, her friend picked up for us. \n\nAnd on my way home, she texted me that they actually ate up my soup, that there was nothing left. Didn\u2019t know how to react, (I honestly was in disbelief, thought she was joking) and after confirming that they really did, I said I\u2019m good, just gonna heat up some food in the fridge. And she insist to order another tomyum soup, I said no please, she said she already ordered.\n\nThen when I came back home, feeling upset abt the forced generosity, I didn\u2019t laugh when they explain abt how they ended up finishing my food, that the soup was great I should try it when it arrives( I honestly couldn\u2019t care less) \nThen when her friend abt to head out, the order finally arrived, she asked me to pick it up, laughing as if it\u2019s something funny\ud83e\udee0\nHer friend asked if there\u2019s anything they can do, she said it\u2019s okay just put their used dishes in the sink.\n\nAnd guess what, playing the \u201cpoor me \u201ccard, I will have to clean up their shit.\n\nI figured that I just can\u2019t take it anymore, asked her to clean up her stuff while I clean up the piled up garbage mountain(we haven\u2019t been able to clean them regularly bc I am off work most of the time as it piles up. And I cleaned it up literally 3 days ago. \nAnd she act as if she is in great pain while cleaning up stuff, I said, you are making me uncomfortable, and she answered: \u201cthat\u2019s the point!\u201d \n\nI put that bag of tomyum soup that arrived late to her fridge section, and refused to drink it when she offered to heat it up for me. (I said no thanks, and again the forced generosity\u2026 she said she already heated up for me smh) and I just left it on the table.\n\nthis whole thing just makes me so so uncomfortable that I simply can\u2019t bear to spend time with her in the same house anymore. I want to try spend most of my time at my friends place or just find a cafe shop and get home as late as I can lol.
