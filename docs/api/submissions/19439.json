I can't wear a lot of shoes because they're not wide enough for my toe now it's at a wonky angle", "how else am I supposed to get around without putting my foot lower then my heart? \n\nElevation, rest, NSAIDs, is what I was told to do\nIt\u2019s worth mentioning I\u2019m 6\u20192 175 and an athlete.", "This is my second broken toe. First time it happened (years ago) I went to the doctor, got xrays, all of it\u2014 and all they did was tell me to wear flat shoes and be careful while it healed. I made literally no adjustments and it didn\u2019t impact anything, just hurt a bit for a month or so.\n\nSo this time I didn\u2019t even bother, just taped it and got on with life. Not worth the bill just to confirm it\u2019s broken\u2026 I can tell that on my own.", "The elevation is usually when not moving because blood pools easier when there's no exertion.\n\nThe rest usually means rest as in non weight bearing on affected foot.\n\nI'm just saying what we do here btw. We also hardly ever recommend bed rest for pregnant women but it seems common in the US", "I've broken my baby toe now, 13x.... (darn horses, and spinning around in the hallway when kids called me and caught it on a wall corner...\ud83e\udd23) I don't have much hope for it to actually heal ever again...", "Yeah well that\u2019s not what I\u2019m experiencing also how the fuck do I move around when if I put my foot down, pain\u2026", "Oh nooo that\u2019s the easiest one to keep hitting! I remember when I was young my mom broke that one and after the first time, it sort of stuck out a bit so she just kept breaking it over and over again", "NTA\n\nBut you really need to grow a pair man.", "NTA. Your friend has a broken toe... she's not completely disabled. At 49 yo F, I literally fell off a cliff while hiking (dirt gave way) and I trashed my left knee and broken both lower leg bones vertically (yes, it can happen).  I learned over time to balance on 1 leg for up to 45 minutes in the kitchen so I could cook. I had 2 high school kids and a husband and was let go from my job bc I couldn't walk. As long as I could use my crutches and get to a kitchen counter to help keep my balance, I was fine.\n\nYour roommate is *taking advantage of you*.  Since she's home full time for a while, she can do *all* the dishes. You deserve to be treated so so so much better.", "I am currently in a cast for breaking my 5th toe. The only thing I can\u2019t do is get groceries because where I live the roads are horrendous. As long as I move around in my dining room chair I am able to do dishes, take care of my hygiene and even haul around my heavy garbage. I am able to go to work in crutches as well. I think she is taking advantage of you.", "Crutches for a broken *toe*? Really? Did she buy them?\n\nNTA she can clean up after herself just fine.", "NTA\n\nI broke a toe from dropping my KitchenAid mixer on it and life went on. I continued with all of my chores. There are also medical devices you can purchase you get around. Your roommate is milking this for all it\u2019s worth.", "I mean... What toe? How bad was the break? I've broken a couple and while it kinda sucked not to be able to climb or go running during that time period, life went on. I lived alone, did my own damn dishes and cleaned up after myself.", "NTA. I have broken both of my big toes on separate occasions. Didn\u2019t need crutches and was still more than capable of doing everything for myself. I just needed to be gentle with walking and mindful of what shoes I could wear. \n\nI also find it incredibly weird that she said she was trying to make you uncomfortable, like why? Stop doing things for her and tell her she needs to step and actually help keep the common areas clean and not full of rubbish.", "Not a dude, but agree with you xD! Will be more vocal from now on.", "For context on this. She broke her toe. That's it and she can't even bother to do dishes.\n\nA few weeks ago my dad through being dumb AF broke his pinkie on his dominant hand in a pneumatic can crusher. This was on a sunday. He was at work on Monday in a splint for it. While people do experience injuries differently... To not even be able to take care of yourself due to a broken... toe... just screams \"poor me poor me\" with a touch of weaponized injury.", "A friend wouldn't do this. Shoot a friend would have made certain your soup wasn't touched in the first place. Stop giving a friendly benefit of a doubt and set up boundries.", "Well, I said IF its big toe then it\u2019s more serious but OP says its not the big one and its the middle toe.\nBig toe is obviously more serious as it carries more weight. The roommate shouldn\u2019t even go for a walk and so on, rest her foot for a few weeks but could still move around enough to clean up after herself or alternatively just not make any mess. Roommates are not obligated to bend over backwards to help unless they want to do so.", "Haha sorry! Grow a spine in that case sis xD \n\nA lot more vocal. Make it obvious how what she is doing is against your wishes; no more being nice. Be assertive.", "Like maybe you should drink more milk or something? Why are your bones so brittle?", "In the original post they did not specify which toe.", "??\n\nI don't think breaking a couple toes after, for example, a cast iron pot lid landed sideways on my bare foot necessarily means my bones are all that brittle.\n\nConsidering in forty years I've never broken any bones other than a few toes I'd say I'm not doing too badly, klutz that I am.", "I'm not saying it isn't painful. \n\nBut they take it so seriously here that anyone who is going to be immobile the way you describe is put on injections to prevent blood clots. They would be mortified at you using a wheelchair. \n\nIt's just different ways of doing things. We get people up and moving ASAP and don't tell them to overly rest unless there's unstable fractures etc. People with fractured hips are mobilised right after surgery and get a zimmer frame maximum. Broken legs same.  (Stable) Spinal fractures same. Knee replacements same. Mobilise like normal, analgesia, certain things elevation recommened when resting. \n\nBeing immobile because of a broken toe is unheard of (here)", "I have a hangnail. Please come bring me dinner and clean up after me.\n\nNTA", "NTA. You're friend is either an incredible wimp or lazy AF. Ive has a broken toe and have had loads of friends woth broken toes.

You ordered, and I assume paid for, a meal for three people. Your portion was eaten, despite there being other food in the house. Instead of apologising profusely and ordering you more soup (with their own money) these people placed another order for more than just you, with your account, against your wishes. \n\nThat\u2019s downright theft, my friend. Even if you roommate was in a cast shoulder to ankle, that\u2019s not okay. \n\nShe is not. She is perfectly fine. She is using her broken toe as an excuse to treat you like a maid, a cook, a housekeeper and an atm. \n\nStop staying out of your home. Start being meaner. Don\u2019t tell her that you\u2019re uncomfortable- tell her she\u2019s being unkind, unfair, she owes you money for the tomyum soup she ate, and that if she *ever* orders using your card again, she\u2019s in for the shock of her life. \n\nNTA.", "NTA it\u2019s a broken toe!!!!!! Seriously people break them all the time without realising. I was living in the central desert when I broke several with no access to medical and I continued going about my normal routine and after a week was even hiking a mountain again.\n\nI have zero empathy for the housemate milking it. Time to get a new housemate", "NTA. She broke a toe, not a hip.", "A broken toe is not fully disabling. If it\u2019s her big toe it will be very painful but not totally derailing. She can do the dishes, or other light chores. If she has to rest while doing it so be it. But she still needs to make an effort. She is manipulative and using others around her. She thinks forcing stuff on you counts as an apology but it doesn\u2019t. If she has t already done so, make sure she\u2019s buddy taping her toes together. This will provide structural support for the fractured toe and might help it feel better so she can do more.", "I dropped a telescope weight on my little toe once. knew it was broken. kept going about my life. Running (cursing under my breath the entire time) typical shoes I liked. just living my life. roomie is an AH.", "I did say eating the food was.

She\u2019s rude and unappreciative", "I did not know broken toes were so horrible.  I had a brown recluse spider bite on my left ankle that sent red infection lines  up past my knee.  I was hospitalized with my leg elevated and on IVs for three days, but when I got home (I had driven myself to the ER).  I  handled everything at home myself. like bringing in firewood for my woodturning stove, taking care of my 10 dogs, etc.  I was also 63 years old at the time.  kt", "A broken toe hurts but it doesn\u2019t render you useless and an arsehole. \n\nNTA", "Pfft. I've broken toes and finished the gig that broke them. You tape it to the next toe and live, because there's truly nothing else to be done.

Combine that with chronic laziness). Buddy tape if it's very bad, and only seek medical attention if it broke in a way that could've damaged the vessels (ie if the toe is super cold suddenly).", "But I really hope no one breaks any hips, it truly sucks.
