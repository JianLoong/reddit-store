You say \"hey can you put this cart back for me?\" And then hand it over when the request is accepted. Also, the point of asking is allowing the person to reject or accept it and not immediately asking what the fuck is wrong with you? Because your request is a request and it is very impolite to start yelling at a stranger because they wouldn't take your cart back. Just leave it if you don't want to that badly. Completely a jerk move, but then again, he already showed he wasn't a polite guy", "Yes", "Yeah Gen X only lasts like ninety seconds max", "Honestly. There certainly are progressive leaning people who are assholes as well...", "1964 was the biggest year of the baby boom.", "This is why putting strict years on generations is ridiculous. Everyone has their own precise years. Some say 63, some say 64, others 65.

You talk to people and they genuinely can\u2019t comprehend not strictly adhering to them. I had a coworker who was 2yrs older than me and genuinely believed his life experience was vastly different because the internet says we\u2019re different generations. Oh right yeah a 25yr old has less in common with a 27yr old than she does with a 10yr old because generations.", "It's all good.", "I agree with you in that kindness is necessary for a better world, but even if I were to politely ask a stranger for help, they're still not obligated to help me. The stranger made a demand, OP refused, they have the right to do that. Now, if the stranger asked politely and OP still responded that way, that'd be a different story, but even still, OP would not be obligated to help if they didn't want to.\n\nI understand what you're saying, I really do. I think it's very important to be kind to others. However, I also don't believe in making excuses for rude people just because they're in pain or sick or having a bad day, especially because those excuses are always for older people and never for people my age.", "Exactly. It\u2019s a marketing ploy to start with and then has become a stupid divisive social media tool."]}
