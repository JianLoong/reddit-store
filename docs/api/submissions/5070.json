Which leads to the next point:\n\n>Dad could easily pick up and hold kiddo and continue his conversation.\n\nHe literally could not. He tried. It failed. Conversation had to end. OP already admits this. The dad was correct that kid-watching and conversation could *not* occur simultaneously. It had to be one or the other.\n\nSo it all boils down to how important was that conversation. The answer seems to fall in between \"important enough to ask the mother to just watch the kid for 10 minutes\" and \"nobody is watching this kid so I guess I have to end this conversation and watch this kid.\"\n\nDad did nothing wrong. When push came to shove, whatever that conversation was about, he gave it up and watched over the kid that the mother literally abandoned.\n\nMeanwhile, the mother is assuming that no matter what that conversation was about, she's free to abandon her kid at the father's feet at any time of the day, without any notice whatsoever.\n\n'Everyone here' is not the correct ruling.", "Even babies can tell when your attention isn't really on them and you're just going through the motions.

If the mother is in the middle of something, and has zero notice that a child is about to be dumped on them, the same thing applies regardless of the gender of the parent.\n\nJust was on an AITA thread where the dad WAS doing that, going on a work trip and making his female roommate a free babysitter. Basically.

If the other parent is available when you are having an important conversation would it not be easier for you to have the other parent watch the kid for the time it takes you to wrap it up and then you can focus on your fussy child who wants you?\n\nBut to expand on my point (even though I really don't think I have to and that you are reading what you want to counter not what I actually said) -\n\nIf mom is having an important conversation at a family event (any event) then dad/other mom should watch the kids, even if the kids get fussy (or so annoying as OP put it thank you user PendegjoDeMexico) until mom is able to finish her conversation and then devote her time to the kid being needy for her attention.\n\nFurther dad/mom should absolutely be able to watch the kid and have the conversation. BUT sometimes the good part of having two parents is that parent A can handle business while parent B watches the kid(s) and then they trade off or whatever else, and that, that was an option in this instance.\n\nAll of which does not address that my entire original point was it's dumb to automatically assume he is lying about the conversation being important simply because it took place at a family event. Regardless of how you feel the ex handled this", "The word \u201cMy kid was asking to see his dad and honestly it was so annoying\u201d literally came from the post but your really trying to paint OP as some super mom ? Both parents are shit and stop that sexist thought process that just cause OP is a woman she had a right to be annoyed with her son and try to dump him on his dad.", "Finishing the conversation and then devoting your focus fully to the kid makes more sense, though. We see this in how it played out. Because the other 2 options are\n\n\\- Try to stop the conversation, give attention to the kid, and then hope that you'll be able to get back to the conversation without the kid throwing a fit... which is a crapshoot if that will work or not, so wouldn't be most people's first option.\n\n\\- Try to give some attention to the kid, which he did. The end result being the conversation took longer, and the kid got more upset.\n\nAlso, this is unlikely the first and will for sure not be the last time the kid cries for dad when with mom and vice versa, they need to know how to handle it because just saying \"here\" is not always an option. \\*shrug\\*", ">Bet if she had asked if she was the ass for not stopping her conversation to take care of her child because dad didn't want to deal you'd say she was the ass for not dropping everything she's doing and getting said child because said child wanted her!

You are creating a fiction and then shooting down the fiction you created.\n\n>Dad made said child as well and dad can take said child at a drop of the dime!\n\nNot how it works.
