Just an important consideration when interpreting peoples opinions here.", "I'd argue the state of the child plays a role here. If it's clear that the child wants or needs the father, he should take that into consideration. If the child is crying for the father, I'd say it's reasonable to ask him to deal with the child. After all, he IS the father, and this is a conversation at a party. It may be important, but it likely can also be postponed. Which would cause some inconvenience to the father, but sometimes having a child will inconvenience you.\n\nIf OP couldn't have calmed the child herself, I'd say the father is in the wrong for not immediately taking care of the child. But alas, I am no parent and I don't actually know whether you're supposed to give in to the child's attention at this stage to postpone an important conversation like this. Might be the child is already at an age where you can start drawing **some** boundaries about when Dad will be available.", "I agree the analogy the other commentor threw in doesn't make sense. It creates an unwanted sense of urgency where there was considerably less urgency involved.\n\nAs for the statement that the father made a demand, I'd disagree. Many questions we ask that involve favours or giving us more time usually come with an expectation of the other person being reasonable. If the OP didn't really have anything urgent to take care of, it's fine to expect her to keep the child for 10 more minutes. \n\nIf I ask someone to do something now that they're supposed to do anyway at some point, I don't necessarily expect them to do it right away, but if their only excuse is \"I don't care\", I'd also assume they're just trying to be difficult (slightly switching the roles here, arguing OP keeping the toddler for 10 more minutes is asking someone to do something now they'd have to do at some point anyways). But if the answer is \"I'm in the middle of an important conversation\", then I'd say \"ok, finish that up and do the thing afterwards\". Because this is a shared responsibility to their child, you can just act like they're both being asked to do the same thing. One response is reasonable and the other isn't.\n\nJudging from the position the father was left in, claiming he made a demand is somewhat weak, because in the same vein, OP also made a demand and was in a position to follow through with that demand as opposed to the father, who didn't have as much power over the situation. He was left to deal with the child, and he eventually did. Again, they're both in similar positions. The father had a conversation that he needed to have (for whatever that reason may be) and the child was becoming increasingly agitated. \n\nMy verdict here would depend on how agitated the child was. Conversations CAN be postponed, after all, but it's always a hassle to get everyone back on the topic. If the child wasn't throwing a tantrum yet, I'd say it's warranted that OP at least try to accommodate the child for 10 more minutes or until it's really looking like the child is going to cry if the father doesn't take care of it right now. That's what I'd expect of a person who is somewhat mindful of other people. OP's response also doesn't put her in a positive light, IF the child wasn't too agitated yet.\n\nIf it was clear the child was about to cry if it didn't get any attention from the father, he has to suck it up and deal with being a dad. This was a party after all and this conversation was merely an opportunity and it could be postponed.

And what happened before the party started. \n\nMy older brother is in that same situation, but accept of dumping the kid with the other parent my family or he will try to calm them down or try to explain that \u201c\u2014\u2014 is busy love, we can do \u2014\u2014 until they come or what do you want to do?\u201d.", "Hard agree. The way it was worded I wasn't even sure the ex was at the party.", "This. Exactly.", "It's HIS son. Looking after your child is part of being a dad. His son was asking for him. Not mum, not anyone else. He's being a deadbeat.", "We don't know how long he was gone before the child started missing him, just that they found her 30 minutes after she took the son to the dad. \n\nMy daughter goes through phases on who she wants and if she wants dad now there's going to be very little I can do to comfort her, only hope I can distract her. If that doesn't work then I'll go find him unless he's at work obviously. Kids are funny creatures lol.", "This. The entire comment section demonizing the guy for being busy. Like...jeez. It happens.", "Damn people are really shitting on you \ud83d\ude33 don't you know that as a woman you have to do all the child minding and allow the man to do the bare minimum. He knows he has a kid, and he's at a party. Schedule a time for such an \"important\" discussion. NTA.", "Interesting because most women seem to think they do until it\u2019s inconvenient for them", "That's an extremely low bar to be considered a deadbeat.", "Disagree on the assumption he hasn't given son attention that day. Our toddler often decides to want one of us all day. Yesterday it was me.\n\nOP had toddler at beginning of story, but that doesn't mean Ex didn't have toddler at any point.\n\nStill not sure what important conversation they could have been having that you couldn't have with the toddler, but could have in this public space.", "That's such a stretch though. We have almost no context for any of those assumptions. And whining or not, it's not good to always give kids what they want. Adults have boundaries too, and if one parent is too busy atm to watch the kid, they're going to have to learn that it happens.", "When did op say she had important things to discuss?", "Women know that it is their body that suffers from growing a child. What's especially important to note is that the man is one of the causes for why there is now a child growing in the woman's body. Therefore, the man can stop his unimportant conversation and start looking after his child like a proper farken father.", "Asking the real questions! Lol", "So what you're saying is, YOUR reasons (whatever they were), for delaying 20 minutes were perfectly valid, but once you actually communicated with your ex, any delay on HIS part is unreasonable.  He had nothing to do with that 20 minute delay at the beginning.  Asking for a few minutes to finish what he is doing is a perfectly reasonable request.  Expecting him to drop everything that second because YOU decided the time was right is not a reasonable request.", "She still chose to have it in the first place, if you dont like what it\u2019ll do to your body literally dont have a kid lol grow up and tell us you hate men some more", "Honestly, it just sounds to me like it was her physical custody time. But we can't know for sure because OP has provided zero background info.", "You mustn't be a parent. If you are, then good luck to your children.", "Oh I missed that it's her ex. I thought it was her husband.", "Ah ues the dad doesnt wanna dad at a party, its only the womans job to watch the kid. Seen this scenario many a times. Thought we lived in 2022 almost 2023 not 1950.", "Have you been here before? If the roles were reversed, the YTAs would be ramped up to 1000, there would be no ESH and people would be tearing him a new one.", "10 more minutes because of an important conversation is not \u201cdoesn\u2019t wanna dad\u201d ya ninnymuggins \ud83d\ude44", "stealing \"ninnymuggins\" for future use - beautiful", ">Dad doesn\u2019t have to drop everything cause kid wants his attention.\n\nActually, yes, that IS how parentig works. Children often demand immediate attention, or have tantrums. It isn't predictable. It happens. If the father told the son \"give me ten minutes,\" sure that would be great. That's not what happened here- he expected OP to be the messenger. That's not OK, and it's incredibly selfish. Doesn't excuse OP leaving her son in the dust, but the dad is absolutely no saint here.", "if it was her custody day then her", "Where was there political commentary?  Like if you view that as political, oh buddy, you are in for a rough time.", "Mum went to go and find the child\u2019s father because the child kept asking for their father and was starting to get upset about it. It\u2019s literally there in black and white why she went to give the kid to the dad and the reason, as you seem to have concluded, was not \u2018he was annoying her\u2019. That\u2019s a very reasonable thing to do - kid repeatedly asks for dad, who you know is at the party with you, so you go find dad. You\u2019ve inferred something from that based on your own views.\n\nFrom then on, there\u2019s not enough info. Was dad in the middle of a genuinely important conversation and would have been true to his word and would have come after 10m? In this case should have been explained to the kid and she should have kept him entertained for 10 more minutes. Or does dad have a habit of thinking whatever his priorities are trump the needs of his son and mum and so mum has to pick up the slack for that? Would 10m actually have been 50m? Was dad\u2019s \u2018important conversation\u2019 about the world cup? Does mum try to ditch kid with dad at group events all the time using it as an excuse the second the kid mentions their dad? Who had been looking after the kid for the majority of the party? Had dad finally stepped away for 10m after being with him the entire party and mum immediately wanted to hand him back, or had mum been watching him the whole event, now kid wanted to know where dad was and she wanted to enjoy some of the party for herself too?\n\nWe\u2019re not going to get an objective answer to those questions but we can still say that ESH because the way these two adults handled their co-parenting relationship resulted in a small child crying.", "30 minutes? When OP found him he asked for 10 minutes. The fact it took 30 minutes until they calmed him down enough and found mum does not mean they wanted or took another 30 mins for the conversation. Stop making assumption.", "This comment should be at the top. Without context of the conversation that dad was having, he can't be ruled the AH just for asking the mom for 10 min. to finish it if it were truly important. If the convo turned out to be nonsense, or she gave him the 10 minutes, and he didn't show up then, or sooner, to get the child, he would have easily been the AH though.", "Give me ten minutes is not reasonable when OP has been caregiving all day. No, give OP ten minutes. It's not just on her to take care of the kid when his dad has been there for 3 hours previously and has not done anything for his kid. People act like men have more important crap to do when mom probably just needs a bathroom break alone ffs.", "Except dad had 3 hours to finish his conversation. Everyone is saying she should be responsible for the toddler and that she's at fault, but he had more than enough time on his own without responsibility at the party.", "\ud83e\udd71\ud83e\udd71 she was annoyed with the child and ditched it that simple", "He asked for 10 mins which she wouldnt allow him. She dumped her kid with someone who said they couldnt look after him for 10 minutes. The 30 minutes is the time it took to calm kid down and find mum and thats very different. It also seems clear the kid didnt want to be with mum, but wanted dad. That looks like dad may be the one the kid wants more because he's the one who  provides most and better care.\n\nFact is we have very little info and you have jumped on the dad without enough evidence and you have misquoted what was said. We dont know who is at fault here. It could be either of them.", "Sorry mate, were you with this family the whole day? Big leaping assumption from you there.", "Again, it depends what the conversation was. It might be reasonable, it might not be.

No, no they absolutely do not.", "I don't think any conversation that could be had at a party is more important than someone else being relieved of responsibility after a long day. If it could be said at a party, it could be finished on the phone later. The conversation was not more important than the toddler and not more important than OP getting a break. If Ex needed to have a life or death talk, the party is not an appropriate place.", "Not going to waste my time reading your lifes story bud lol", "Patience no, but decide who they like, absolutely they do. Its usually the mum as they are the one who provides most of the care, but I have know SAHD's as well and the kids go to them s they are the primary carer.", "He was also the caretaker at the time!", "Idk I\u2019ve had many private conversations at family gatherings about my cousin who has BPD and frequently tries to kill herself. Also about my grandmother\u2019s failing health etc. Sometimes it\u2019s the only place you see certain family, sometimes after a couple of drinks people loosen up enough to talk about things otherwise unsaid, sometimes conversations get deep. Who knows. Without content of the conversation I wouldn\u2019t call judgement on either party, but I think your black and white view of the situation is unfair.", "expecting fathers to be parents is not hating men", "So if the childs wants to be with mom after a 16h shift and only 1h of sleep the mom have to just suck it up and be with the kid, and the dad can play games?\n\nThats a deadbeat dad for me, but if the child always comes first it may be OK to you."]}
