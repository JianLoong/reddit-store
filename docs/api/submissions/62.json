To drag her there?", "YWBTA- based on what you have described, how is making an appointment going to get her to the Doctor? Are you going to trick her? You have made your opinion known but you can't force her to do anything. You can evaluate whether or not you can handle being in a marriage with someone who will not go to the Doctor, but you can't make her go.", "YWBTA most definitely!!\n\nYour wife is an adult, fully capable of making decisions for herself. You would be greatly overstepping to make a doctors appointment for her without her consent and without asking her.\n\nThe right thing to do is be supportive of her choice and let her come to any decision herself.", "YTA. What are you going to do, knock her out and stuff her in the trunk of your car? Drag her by her hair into the doctor's office? Hold her down while the doctor examines her?

Unless she asked you to make the appointment explicitly, you overstepped.", "YWBTA. That would be disrespectful unless she were having a mental health crisis or some other condition that meant she'd lost capacity or was disconnected from reality - none of which applies here. Don't undermine her autonomy. Women miss periods for lots of reasons. Talk to her and tell her you're worried.", "INFO: What's your plan for getting her to go? You can make the appointment, but ultimately, it's up to her to actually be there and see the doctor.", "YTA even though you clearly are worried and mean well.  Much better for you to stop trying to compel her and spend more time understanding and supporting her.  That includes her right to refuse care", "Thanks everyone for your swift responses. I\u2019ve chosen not to make this appointment without my wife. Tonight we will talk and have a heart to heart and give each other our feelings and concerns. \n\nGoing behind her back and handling her problems for her would be overstepping too far.", "YWBTA\n\nIf she is scared, for whatever reason, then applying pressure is just going to stress her out more.\n\nJust sit her down and say that you love her and want to live a long life with her.

There van be many explantations for a missed cycle that isn't pregnancy, could be stress or hormone/vitamin deficiency off the top of my head which might also fluctuate weight and cause mood swings. Why don't you suggest ways you guys could help her reduce potential stress and get an over the counter multi vitamin, try that for say a month (ideally 3 months for vitamins to work but I think its important to get a professional assessment) and if no improvement revisit the doctor idea that way she doesn't have to feel the immediate pressure of getting checked out and has something she can actively do for herself that would also help reduce your worry for her? \n\nI stress though I am not a medical professional only suggestions based on my own experiences", "Deeply YTA - if you can recognise that nagging her to make an appointment is  AH behaviour how on earth do you not see it's even more disrespectful to just secretly overrule her??\n\nRespect her autonomy and vent your stress outwards.", "YTA.\n\nI appreciate that you are concerned, but going to a doctor has to be her own choice.  The only time that she would not be able to make that choice for herself is under your country's compulsory detainment for mental health reasons, and for that she normally has to pose a danger to either herself or others (and that usually has to be agreed by a mental health specialist).\n\nShe is a grown woman who has mental capacity to make her own decisions, even if those decisions are not what you would make.  \n\nUnless her BMI is very high (above 45) it's unlikely that should would have just stopped having her periods.  There are many, many other reasons behind amenorrhoea, and stress is one of them (as experienced by the pressure of her partner and friends to go see a doctor).", "YWBTA You really can\u2019t say you respect her bodily autonomy and then try to manipulate her into going to the doctor at the same time.  Of course I agree that she should go. Burying your head in the sand is not going to fix things.  Ask her how long she thinks allowing these symptoms to persist before seeing a doctor is reasonable.  Then offer to take her is she wants support. Beyond that you are just making her resent you and giving her more stress, which definitely won\u2019t help resolve the issues.", "YTA her body her choice even if it\u2019s unwise.

Which you can't be an AH for.\n\nYou would be in the wrong though. For trying to force the issue like this.\n\nJust encourage her to see a doctor. Point out that if something is wrong. Whatever the condition is. It is generally much easier to treat or cure early on. As it worsens. Treatment becomes more difficult or even impossible.\n\nBy the way. Weight gain and period issues can be a simple thyroid problem. Which just needs a daily pill to correct. This could all be very easy to deal with.", "a soft YWBTA only because it seems the issue is she does not have a health practitioner that practices Health at every size. I would recommend showing her that HAES exists. and talking to her about finding a doctor in your area that practices HAES if you google how to find a doctor that practices HAES or Health At Every Size, you should find resources local to you.", "Tbh I don\u2019t think it matters if u are or aren\u2019t an AH, u said in someone\u2019s reply that she wud be mad but still go to the appointment and u won\u2019t force her (not like ur gonna drag her there as a lot of people have assumed) so I wud go for it, it\u2019s for her health as u have genuine concerns not some ridiculous reason, she will get over it \n\nIf she has something like PCOS which requires treatment or is found to be pregnant then it\u2019s worth it more than being an AH", "Info : does she have pre-diagnosed PCOS or other condition?", "NTA, You are genuinely worried for your wife's health. If I were you I would try and reassure her that you are in it for the long haul no matter if shes 130 or 1300lbs. Sometimes both parties in a relationship just need some affirmation that their partner is always going to be in their corner and isnt going to up and leave at the first sign of trouble. \n\nAlso I would recommend you ahve her at least get a blood test RE: pregnancy to confirm, as my wife took three tests all false neg. Its rare but it happens lol", "NTA \n\nBut in reality I don\u2019t think this is about being an asshole or not.

As someone who has an incredibly stubborn partner, I can see where your coming from. Did the mood swings and changes in her body come on suddenly? As for your wife I would say if a number of people are concerned for your health it would be important to go, but she seems more concerned with being fat shamed. (Which is a valid reason to be afraid of going to the doctor) but it shouldn\u2019t stop her from getting care she deserves.", "I\u2019m going with NAH.  You\u2019re coming from a place of love and concern, and have zero intention of forcing/tricking her to go to the doctors.  Sometimes concerns can paralyze someone from taking action on their own behalf (maybe I\u2019m better off not knowing type thinking).\n\nIf anything Y T A for getting her friends involved, that\u2019s crossing a boundary of privacy", "NTA. I have no idea what will come of it or not, but it sounds like this is coming from a place of love. You could point out that you know you have a selfish point of view where you are willing to do whatever it takes to make sure you have a long relationship with a healthy partner, even if she fights you on it.\n\nMy husband and I have fought for years about his health. I am always making appointments for him and he gets annoyed, but he goes when I make the appointments. It's  the only source of contention in our relationship. He was born with wretched genetics and it just is what it is, so I always push for more medical care because I - just like you - selfishly want to live with him as my partner for as long as possible.\n\nIt's gotten better over the years but it will never go away as our ongoing conflict, or at least not until he starts driving his own medical care and does all the things his doctors instruct him to do.\n\nBe aware that if you push too much you may push her away. It's a gamble I make all the time, but my husband's situation is such that if I didn't, I wouldn't have anyone to come home to anyway. For me, it is well worth the marital conflict.", "I'm not going to call you an ah because your heart is in the right place. You love your wife, and you're worried for her health.

But she has to make the call.", "NAH your heart is in the right place. Unfortunately too many doctors dismiss every concern overweight women express as \"you need to lose weight\". They don't listen to them, they don't run appropriate tests, they don't take them seriously. They just assume every health indication is due to weight. I've no doubt your wife is one of the many women who now ignores her own health issues for fear of being shamed yet again by a doctor who should listen and act.

Maybe that sounds weird, but that's kind of where I'm at: I'm nearly paralyzed when it comes initiating appointments, but if the appointment is set up, it's NBD to go.\n\nIf your wife is otherwise comfortable making phone calls or scheduling things, YWBTA.\n\nHere's the thing: some doctors fat shame and will even blow off or ignore serious symptoms because \"clearly\" the only problem is that you're fat. This is well established. If she's anything like me, she's already beating herself up about her body no matter how much you tell her she's beautiful, and even just thinking about going to the doctor/getting weighed can be traumatizing. \n\nThat said, her period being a month late and the bodily/hormonal changes are a red flag from your body saying YO SOMETHING'S UP. I think you're right to be concerned about her health, and she should be getting regular exams from a GP and gynecologist. If her problem is just that she's fat, ok, great! At least then you know it's not PCOS or endometriosis or cancer (it's probably not cancer) or whatever else. There are actually worse things than just being fat, and visiting a doctor is a great way to rule them out. \n\nA couple things that might help: \n\n* Make this a health journey for both of you. Do YOU regularly see a doctor for checkups? If you don't, start by making that appointment for yourself. \n* There's a YouTube influencer who goes by Glitter and Lazers who recently posted a health update video that might (might?) help your wife. Not sure I can link it, but the video code is sHK1i41GZBQ. She knew she was overweight and some other things might not be right, but she was terrified of going to the doctor and just getting fat-shamed. She ended up having some serious health issues unrelated to or besides her weight that finally got diagnosed, and I thought her plea asking people to just go to the doctor was really powerful. Being fat doesn't make you unworthy of getting help. \n* Talk to her! Find out (gently!) why she's so resistant. I'm making a lot of weight-related assumptions here because that's my experience, but maybe she has some sort of other doctor-related trauma that she hasn't told you about. Her friends may have recommendations for especially sympathetic or gentle doctors, or maybe she could find a community here that could give her some anonymous advice and encouragement.", "As someone who had someone constantly but their nose where it didn\u2019t belong-don\u2019t do it.

There are a lot of doctors who are assholes to overweight patients and will dismiss any concerns or symptoms as being caused by weight. There are tons of stories online of serious health issues being over looked simply because of the patient's weight. Also many doctors think shame is a good motivator when it will actually make things worse and cause the kind of avoidance that your wife is going through right now.
