He probably was miffed at you for undermining his parenting choice at that time. He definitely should not have chosen that moment to work all this out.

Just to be clear, if my children enjoy a particular book, I will go out and buy every book by that author to encourage their reading. I am all for buying lots of books. But you didn't buy a second book to encourage your child's literacy; you wanted to buy the book to reward throwing tantrums.

You had an original agreement of \u201ceach kid gets one book.\u201d You unilaterally decided to change that, and your husband unilaterally told you you weren\u2019t allowed to. Unilaterally making decisions without discussion isn\u2019t cool on either of your parts. A marriage can\u2019t work without communication. \n\nIt sounds like you guys didn\u2019t have a real conversation about this at all. What were his concerns? Was it favoritism by allowing one kid to get more books than the other? was it the financial cost? Was it that you were going back on a boundary that you set with the child?

And does so repeatedly. What is his problem? Is it getting worse? Why don't you stand up to him? Are you afraid of his temper? Are the kids? There are some serious questions here, I think.", "It's not funny at all. You are sitting by while your husband traumatizes your child. And your solution is to undermine your child's feelings by pretending it's funny? You're a terrible parent.", "What\u2019s funny about a whole ass adult having a meltdown because you buy one extra book at the book fair?", "You all agreed on one book per kid. Depending on your income, the book is a small thing, but going back on what you parents decided without consulting each other isn\u2019t a good idea.  It\u2019s one thing if you are on your own with the kid and you know it\u2019s something the other parent wouldn\u2019t care about. But, he was right there! In that moment you make eye contact and have that nonverbal conversation. Or you discuss it while your kid is distracted by the friend. You don\u2019t just decide on your own. \n\nThis is where having a clear reason for your plan is important. Why only one book? Are you trying to keep it fair? Is it a budgeting issue? Do they already have a ton of books gathering dust? If you\u2019re all on the same page, it helps manage these spur of the moment decisions. \n\nIf you both agree to go back on the one book rule, give the kid a brief explanation within the context of how you arrived at the one book rule. (\u201cYou can get two books, but you\u2019re going to have to pick one at home to donate/use your allowance for the second/help Sibling pick a second/etc.\u201d) You don\u2019t want them thinking you\u2019ll just cave if they bug you. The other thing you\u2019re doing is teaching them impulse control. If you have no reason for changing the plan, they aren\u2019t learning that decision making process when they are faced with these things on their own. They need to learn stick to their goal even when something flashy comes along, and how to reevaluate a situation to determine if it\u2019s time to make a change. \n\nIf you decide to stick with the one book plan, remind them of why the rule is one book only, then help them make the choice between the books. You might have to step out of line to deal with it. \n\nMy vote is ESH because you both handled it badly. If he does this all the time y\u2019all need to figure out which of you is causing that. Is he too rigid or in a hurry or whatever? Or are you always changing the plan and parenting decisions without getting input from him?", "These comments are wild. I can see both sides of this disagreement but going straight to saying he is abusive and to leave him is absurd. \n\n\nFirst off, how often do you give in to your toddler and push past the boundary you put down? Your 1 year old got 1 book like you said they could but the 3 year old has a temper tantrum and they get 2? That is how you quickly teach your child to cry to get what they want. And its hell to retrain them out of it. \n\n\nSecond, I get you wanted to just buy the book. Your kids can never have enough books. A love of reading will set them up for success for a lifetime. But you said 1 book each. So you need to stick to it. If you wanted to buy more \"for you\" (like come on, that is clearly a feeble excuse) then you damn sure better buy some for the 1 year old too. Fair is fair. \n\n\nYou should ask your husband to talk things over. You clearly have different views on when to give in to extras and when not to. But one thing is certain. Giving in to temper tantrums is setting your kid up for failure. Reward when they behave good not when they behave bad.", "I'm a Montessori preschool teacher. One of the things we as teachers and us parents have to teach is self-regulation. We cannot always get what we want all the time. Children have to learn how to accept when things don't go their way. When the husband told the son that he could only get one book and and that was the agreed. Upon deal it should have been final.  Many parents often give into their child because they don't want to deal with a meltdown, screaming and embarrassment. In the long run that doesn't help the child. After a few meltdowns and screaming, the child will eventually learn that he can't always have what he wants and to appreciate the things that he does get. I don't think anyone's the a****** here. I recommend reading the book The Absorbent Mind. Good luck", "Yta - you should\u2019ve actually stepped out a line and explained to your child that you get one choice each.

I could have laid the groundwork for that better but how much emotional support does this grown man need to go to a book fair. I wasn\u2019t trying to avoid a tantrum or spoil my kid. I was just trying to let him have fun buying a book. His other books are gifts. I wanted him to choose.

I don't want them to think they can throw a fit and have a brat attack because they'll get their way. And 3) I also sometimes just see the purchases unnecessary or excessive and I don't want the kids to grow up spoiled and unappreciative. \n\nI've become a whole lot better of verbalizing concerns and not making a scene or lashing out but usually the lashing out was just poor emotional control due to being completely overwhelmed with the whole new parenting and navigating kids thing. \n\nI don't think you're an AH I was just commenting to give another side.", "YTA\n\nIt\u2019s not about books or reading or anything else.  you and your husband agreed one book each and you thought you would unilaterally change it.

I remember my mum limiting me to 10 books at a time growing up FROM THE LIBRARY (because we went during grocery shopping and had to take the bus - we both needed to be able to hold groceries and my books) and part of the process was sitting on the floor and going through probably 100 books to narrow it down to 10, copying the names of the books I wanted into a notebook and ticking off the ones I was getting so next time I could get the others. I have fond memories of my mum and I doing this EVERY WEEK even though I know it was not fun for her but she would have the biggest smile on her face when I would happily talk all the way home on the bus ride about the books I chose and which ones I didn\u2019t choose and why I didn\u2019t choose them. \n\nAnyways NTA. Reading is something that should be encouraged from a young age.

OP decided to cave to avoid a tantrum and get two books. What should have happened was that you two as parents should have gotten out of the book buying line, sat down with your 3 year old, and compared the books to see which one he wants more. Then also discuss, between just the adults, whether to change the rule to 2 books each. There is never going to be a \"good\" experience when trying to give a child the ability to impulse buy things with your money. When I go with my kid to the school book fair, I usually establish a rule of minimum 2 books or a maximum of $20, kid's choice. After that I might cave and get a 3rd book if it was something I believed would be educational for my kid such as a chapter book that's slightly above her reading level, while also turning down any attempts to get another comic. We could then visit the used book store and buy 5 times as many books for the same price and check out as many books as she wants at the library.

She says the dad apologized, do they presumably had a conversation about it, but op conveniently leaves out what was said, what the dads reasoning was, or really any details or information at all.\n\n\nHonestly with how much bullshit passes through here, I'm amazed at how easily everyone is buying this vague story of a book hating monster.", "Ah yes, the old \u201cit wouldn\u2019t be fair if the one year old child doesn\u2019t have equitable library\u201d argument. Certainly a worthy cause for an adult to throw a tantrum about in public.", "He didn't. People are just bad at reading I think.", "I mean that's the term OP used.", "No, the trauma comes from a grown man having a meltdown because his wife bought their child a book.", "I just bought my toddler three children\u2019s books at a book fair. $50. I wouldn\u2019t say money is tight but I don\u2019t know any family that can afford unlimited books right now at those prices\u2019 And I am ALL for my daughter reading\u2014she has hundreds of books but most of them were gifts and hand-me-downs. Limiting the number of brand new books a child can pick out in a situation like this is absolutely appropriate. If they want more books we will go the library, or Goodwill, or Buy Nothjng or visit some Little Free Libraries.", "When she said she knew it was going to be a meltdown she meant her adult husband, based on other comments. And... That's really sad. I thought she meant the three year old and was pretty neutral. But if she has to cave to prevent her husband from having a public tantrum...", "It sounds like the kid decided he wants a different book after all, and OP told him she'll get the first book as well. So the kid wasn't trying to force anything. If OP's husband didn't like that she wanted to treat their kid because it was a special occasion or whatever, he could have talked to her later. Not tell the kid, who was already assured by OP thay they would get both books, that they won't but the first one after all. That OP can't buy it either. If we're talking about consistency for the kids, parents undermining each other doesn't feel very secure. One parent telling the other not to buy something in front of small kids - even worse. And it was cheap books, not supermarket candy or a toy that will break after two days of use.", "Sure. \u201cAlso this is hilarious. I should remember this with my 3 yo that daddy had a meltdown.\u201d\nMaybe you should just shut up", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

The wording could apply to the toddler or the husband. The husband isn't even described as angry in the story. Literally no adjectives are applied to him, go and check. Describing an adult as having a tantrum is also unusual, especially given that he was not otherwise described as emotional, angry, even annoyed or peeved. \n\nAnd on the other hand you have a toddler, who had a meltdown. \n\nAnd you think the meltdown was supposed to apply to the husband?", "He stuck to the one book each rule and told his wife not to give in. The kid throws a tantrum when he didn't get double presents. Even then the dad calmly carries him out of the store with his one book. At no point in the story is the father angry, upset, irate or anything that would imply he was about to have a public freak out", "Oh no. The dad taught his child that there are rules sometimes. What a narcissistic abuser.", "Who do you think is actually going to read and re-read the books many, many times?", "What's funny about him upsetting his wife and kids?", "Or you get angry and do something productive, which would be best for the kids here.", "I wouldn\u2019t say the child already knows becuase we don\u2019t know what the kid knows. Kids bounce back pretty quick- he probably did think dad was mean in that moment then 5 minutes later they may have been playing like nothing happened. \nWe are also hearing 1 side of the story & there are always 3 sides. Theirs, yours & the truth that\u2019s somewhere in the middle", "Really smart to demonize your kids father as \"mean\".", "Because she didn't do anything.", "Because then they can insult op", "It's a book, not a toy or a piece of candy. Books are good. Encouraging reading as a child will have positive effects for this child's whole life. As long as there is no money issue, buy the kid as many books as he wants.", "It wasn't about hating books. It was about control and showing her who's boss IN PUBLIC, which makes it even worse. He wanted to humiliate her in public with his \"power.\"", "The child wasn\u2019t indecisive, he changed his mind and was switching to a different book; which he should be allowed to do. If it were up to the child it was still 1 book. OP decided to buy the original book. Maybe he\u2019s not abusive but he damn sure overreacted.", "Just told her to buy the one book. Fuck that noise. This is not an isolated incident .Domestic violence is about power and control.\nAs a therapist I can tell you for sure, ordering someone to follow your wishes even about small things like books often escalates over time to physical violence and even murder", "Yeah, I'm not seeing what everyone is getting so heated about. What's the point of agreeing to a number of books to buy if they aren't going to stick to that number? The post reads like painting the dad as buy guy for no good reason.", "I mean, I wouldn't say no good reason. There's lessons to teach even 3 year Olds. Perhaps he's concerned about raising an entitled child who ends up with two books despite the agreement being one each. Perhaps he's trying to teach him once you've picked something to stick with it. Maybe OP tends to buy him anything he wants if he's cute enough about it and the husband is concerned. Maybe she overspends and their budget is tight.\n\nThis is all conjecture of course, pulled out of nowhere. OP gives no reason for her husband's behaviour. But that doesn't mean that there cannot *be* a good reason. It just means OP either doesn't know, or isn't saying. It's equally possible that he's a control freak and OP is enabling him to make the kids cry needlessly. But it's wrong to say he definitely made 3 cry for no good reason.", "So OP had a meltdown?", "OP is a child. Traumazied lol, she isn't fit to raise children from this post.", "yeah, I thought it was dramatic when she said it, too. her husband is obviously an AH who thinks he gets to \"lay down the law\" and steamroll his wife, but that doesn't mean that this experience was traumatic for their son. upsetting, sure.", "Good thing that didn't happen then", "Ah I assumed the three year old as well", "Exactly! Narcissists come up with arbitrary rules and expect other people to follow them so that they can feel like they\u2019re in control. Then they cause a big scene over something as silly as a book. \n\nGreat job spotting narcissistic behaviour!", "The kid wanted to switch which book he bought, so he could read a book with his friend. The mom decided, y'know what, I'll get both and buy this one for myself, so he has something else to read when he's finished. The dad decided that wasn't allowed, refused to let his wife buy the book, and made his son return the book he wanted.\n\nYou could argue that maybe the dad is in the right (or at least, not in the wrong) if it was just about the number of books (i.e. \"we told him he could get one, so let's just get one\") but he instead decided to play control freak and refused to allow his son to change his mind. I don't get why people are defending him here, it's true that it isn't that big a deal in isolation, but OP already said that he does this regularly.", "That's why Mom is the AH.", "I hope it's looking up!", "there's also a difference between minimising odd and aggressive behaviour and making some awkward comments as you realise that you're in an abusive relationship", "Yeah, or that. But either way, sitting and crying isn't helpful.", "The kid already knows. The mom denying this will cause them not to trust her either.", "You\u2019re a therapist? You know very very little about this couple outside of this minor incident and you\u2019re talking about physical violence and murder. I\u2019 m more worried about your patients than I am the OP.", "Right,\n\nWife says each kid should buy 1 book.\n\nWife changes mind and wants to buy 3 books because one of the children wants to change their original choice.\n\nHusband says no, let's stick to the original plan. (This is obviously because he wants to exert power and control over her and the kids)\n\nHusband later agrees they should've just bought the 3 books, he was wrong, so he apologizes.\n\n...time passes.\n\nHusband is a murderer.", "No. OP capitulated to her husband\u2019s unreasonable demand, in order to prevent him from throwing a fit. OP was completely reasonable through the entire encounter.", "Here's a gem for words that have lost meaning through modern day spamming: \"Triggered\".", "I'm teaching kindergarten this year. You're giving me ideas of an \"Itty Bitty Book Club\" Hmmmm.....", "You\u2019re an absolute moron if you think telling a child \u201cyou can pick out one\u201d and then teaching them to stand by that is narcissistic. The dads just trying to teach the kid how to be a member of society and you\u2019re losing your mind over it.", "I do agree that meaningless \"because-I-said-so\"s are damaging over time, having personal experience in that department too. I also can't say that OPs husband *hasnt* traumatized their son. but in the context of this stand alone situation, I think it's overkill to call it \"traumatizing.\" I agree with your assessment though", "The dad is trying to control his wife\u2019s actions. She\u2019s allowed to buy as many books as she wants for her child and he should have fuck all to say about it.\n\nHe\u2019s controlling.", "Sure thing and if you need help developing outside of a dictionary, plenty of places that might help your understanding of humanity.  Not me of course, no patience for dullards lacking basic knowledge or empathy.  Try volunteering, can't hurt and might actually help form something other than an empty human husk.", "The mom is trying to control her husband\u2019s actions. He\u2019s allowed to teach as many life lessons as he wants to his child and she should have fuck all to say about it. You see how absolutely smooth brained that argument is right?", "Honestly, your response is probably the most eloquently put. Even with the insults. I admire good writing! So far off base but well said."]}
