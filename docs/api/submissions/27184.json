That is weird.... and very manipulative, his apology means nothing and, from now on, leave him at home before he has a chance to ruin all of your children's childhood memories.", "NTA - i agree with the cashier that is very weird", "What exactly do you mean by \u201che does this shit all the time\u201d?\n1. He frequently creates unnecessary power struggles\nOR\n2. He holds a firm boundary on something that you want to compromise on\n\n\nI can see 2 legitimate points of view on the incident. The \u201cwe said 1 book, and we are not starting a habit of whining or tantruming to get extras\u201d view. And the \u201clet\u2019s make books and reading fun and exciting\u201d view.  The problem is when you aren\u2019t clear about the goal of the outing. Kids figure out really early how to divide and conquer parents to get their way (not saying that kids are bad when they do this, they\u2019re just exploring how their actions can change their environment).\n\nI don\u2019t feel like I have enough info to make a judgement call.  But if I may give some advice-work on your communication as a couple.  You are just starting the toddler years and it will be a nightmare if you undermine each other. Come to an agreement on what your intent on something is, then back each other up.", "Girl run, this will only be the start of testing how far he can push his controlling behavior.", "Info: did you tell your 3yo he could only get one book?", "Info- did your husband say why he acted this way? I\u2019m wondering if he did so to try to avoid getting your three year old in the habit of wanting/expecting to buy him everything he wants. If the expectation was that they would each get one book, then he probably wanted to install in your son that that was a firm boundary so that you in the future you don\u2019t have a child who expects you to constantly relax the boundaries. He probably was miffed at you for undermining his parenting choice at that time. He definitely should not have chosen that moment to work all this out. At the cash register in front of staff is never a good time to trigger a three year old. And to forbid you from doing something puts him firmly in the asshole category.", "It was fear of the kids tantrum that prompted mother to go back on the deal with 3 year old for one book .", "YTA. You told your kids they could get one book each. But fear of your childs tantrum made you decide to get two books. Basically you rewarded the child that throws tantrums with two books. Meanwhile, your one year old who didn't have a tantrum only got one book.  Just to be clear, if my children enjoy a particular book, I will go out and buy every book by that author to encourage their reading. I am all for buying lots of books. But you didn't buy a second book to encourage your child's literacy; you wanted to buy the book to reward throwing tantrums. It is normal for three year olds to throw tantrums; it is a natural part of growing up and learning boundaries and self control. You are being held hostage by your three year old. Your child is not traumatised by being told no; that is just stupid.", "Your messaging is a bit mixed ,I thought the deal was a book each for the kids . Buying one for yourself is not an ideal move if you told your child they could have one . Maybe this was annoying for your husband as he wanted to reinforce the idea of of the single book . You throw confusion into the mix by saying you will buy the first book for yourself ?\u2026 Why not just swop the books ,perhaps it would have been a non issue and a cohesive parenting approach . If there is a tantrum at the register so be it at least it would be just normal three year old stuff ie  can\u2019t have two books  . It sounds possible you and your husband are not working as a team and missing each others intentions . You says he does this kind of thing all the time \u2026\u2026. is he acting out of frustration that you want things to pan out a certain way .", "NTA\n\nI would have told him, \"I do what I want!\" And switch out the books.  The deal was 1 book each, a THREE year old is allowed to change their mind. I am not catering to an adult in a snit. That is ridiculous. \n\nI would absolutely stop catering to his tantrums.  Why are you going along with this??", "Definitely NTA, and I\u2019m so sorry you and your children have to deal with such nonsense.

Why don\u2019t you tell him to back off a bit? Why does he get to decide for you? \n\nIf you follow what he says because you\u2019re too afraid about him causing a scene - that\u2019s a red flag. \n\nYour kids notice this happening, that it\u2019s ok for dad to treat people lien this. This is the new normal. It\u2019s not. Nip that shit in the bud.", "Esh but more you imo.  Teaching Kids that you don\u2019t get everything you want is a valuable life lesson.  You agreed to one book each which is reasonable.  Parenting from a point of trying to avoid meltdowns is a poor strategy.  You both suck for arguing in front of the cashier but you started it with trying to undermine your husband and go back on buying the one book deal you made.", "Nta. Why does your husband have the ability to over rule you like that? \n\nHe's a narcissist abuser. Get out now. This will never change.", "I wpuld ignore him and but the books.
