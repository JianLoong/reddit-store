One big problem is my family's idea of \"growing up\". When I was starting middle school, my older brother and uncle told me that I was becoming a man, and \"real men don't play Pokemon\". They convinced me to give up on my Game Boy, and 'donated' my Pokemon cards to a family we knew. (They left the cards in a shed, and the whole collection got severely damaged and then thrown out.)\n\nI opened up to my gf (F22) about it, and now she and I have started collecting Pokemon cards together. It's been a good experience, and it's helped me confront the past. Between the support from her and my therapist, I built up the courage to talk to my brother and uncle about the cards.\n\nI know it sounds dumb, but I loved those cards, and just from the ones I remember having, I looked them up--it would cost roughly $12,000 to get my old card collection back (they were all from the early TCG days). I told the two of them that they'd hurt me, that I was trying to heal and care for my inner child, and that I'd appreciate if they would make up for the past by helping gf and I with our collection. I told them they could either buy a booster pack here and there, or save up together and get my favorite card back (the original Dark Charizard card, it came from a pack my dad got me after he was away at seminary for a month--he used to get me cards all the time, it was really good quality time together).\n\nThis did not go over well. My uncle tried to gaslight me, claiming that this incident never happened and he didn't owe me anything. My brother didn't think I was serious, and after I tried to explain further, he assumed it was all about the money/value of the cards. (It's not, I was trying to explain how difficult it would be to get the cards back.) Both of them refuse to buy any cards, and they're both pissed at me about it now.\n\nI'm starting to wonder if I was too demanding or aggressive when I came to them with such a blunt statement and a plan already set out. I'm wondering if it would've gone over better if I just started a conversation, and maybe we could've come up with a solution together.\n\nOn the other hand, my older brother has never respected my boundaries, or anyone else's, and gets pissy when even one thing doesn't go his way. We've gotten into arguments over him not watching TV in my office while I'm working from home, not spending my money for himself, etc. And my uncle's an alcoholic who's bullied me about my appearance my whole life, including when I was a kid. It might have been a lost cause regardless of my approach.\n\nEither way, I'm pretty sure I've permanently added unnecessary tension to family gatherings, when I could've just kept my mouth shut.\n\nAITA for asking the two of them to buy me Pokemon cards?\n\nEDIT: To be clear, I don't expect anyone to spend $12k on Pokemon cards. Booster packs are about $4. \n\nMy dad and my other brother have started buying cards again after I told them gf and I started collecting. I guess I was just hoping these two would take the same path.", "created_utc": 1667575080, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ym1pj9/aita_for_asking_my_family_members_for_pokemon/", "score": 2, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If they were narrow in their opinions on masculinity while you were a child then it was highly unlikely they'd consider this request from an adult. In addition, you don't get to dictate gifts that other people give you.\n\nIn the long run you'd be better accepting them as they are and distancing yourself from their more hurtful behaviour.

That's useful information. You know they do not have your best interests at heart. \n\nSo you can use the information and limit what you say to them. \n\nGood luck.", "I wouldn't say you're ta.

I agree with you that this was a lost cause before it started. \n\nBut that should not imply that I think you were wrong for doing it. \n\nSee, what you're describing is a long-standing pattern of abusive behaviour that you're now learning was, and still is, thoroughly not okay. What I believe you should consider, frankly, is why your uncle and your brother are allowed a place in your life at all.\n\n>Either way, I'm pretty sure I've permanently added unnecessary tension to family gatherings, when I could've just kept my mouth shut.\n\nDon't go down this road. You aren't the problem and never were.\n\nThere's a fantastic post on Reddit somewhere about the phrase \"rocking the boat.\" The gist of it is, when you're accused of rocking the boat, the most common reality is that you were actually the one keeping it steady. By standing up for yourself and holding the *real* boat-rockers accountable for their actions, you're refusing to steady the boat. When you distance yourself from the boat-rockers, you're leaving the boat behind entirely.\n\nSo now the boat is rocking, and the people involved who lack the confidence to call out the boat-rockers instead place the blame on you for leaving, branding you as responsible for rocking the boat because it's easier than dealing with the truth.\n\nSo don't go down this road. The tension at those family gatherings won't be your fault, it'll be theirs. The Pok\u00e9mon card thing is just scratching the surface of the way they treat you, and you have every right to step off the boat. I know I would.\n\n**NTA.**", "ESH\n\nLook.
