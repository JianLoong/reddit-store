You broke up. Eff that noise. You're not responsible for him anymore.", "NTA - To me, your ex BF\u2019s request for post counseling is just weird & unnecessary. Sometimes you just \u201coutgrow\u201d the people in your life, this is just one of those times.", "Tell your ex you think he should get counseling all by himself. Tell him you think that would be a great idea.\n\n(Because you aren\u2019t going to fall for this lame ass attempt to get you back or guilt trip you, or whatever this is). NTA", "Lol. Tell me we haven\u2019t gotten to the point in society that we need post break up therapy so the person who did the breaking up has to make the other feel better about themselves?!?! That\u2019s not how this works. NTA", "NTA- Most people who go through this type of counseling do so because they still need to be around each other post breakup. Colleagues, friendship or family groups they both still want to be involved with, and the main reason is if they share children. If you are not planning to remain in contact with your Ex, then there is no reason to attend post breakup counseling. Your Ex needs to learn to be okay in his own headspace without you.", "NTA. I don't care if you did \"mess it up\" (and I'm not convinced that here you did), you have no obligation to go to any post break up counseling. It's his issue, not yours.", "NTA. His issues are his to work out, not yours. If he really respected the breakup, he wouldn't be bugging you to go to therapy nor blaming you for his problems. You are free - stay that way.", "NTA  \nSounds like a bid for control over the situation versus just accepting he'd been cut loose.", "This sounds like a desperate attempt to stay in contact. NTA", "Imagine being so entitled to emotional labour you want your ex to do the therapy work for you", "NTA. People are on you about \"laughing\". Sone requests are so audacious that it is impossible not to laugh. You're not responsible for him and not should you be. I hope he gets the help he needs and hopefully his future shrink will help him learn that was an inappropriate request with additional insane follow ups from him and your 'friends\".", "NTA Post break up counselling for couples is for couples who despite breaking up are still attached such as due to Kids. It helps them work together going forwards despite the relationship issues. \n\nIt\u2019s not done for two people who have just broken up. It sounds like he wants you to go to relationship therapy with him and get back together", "NTA. You cannot be expected to do this, it\u2019s not a reasonable request. If you had any issues yourself and thought you might find this useful, then yes, of course you should do it. But if it\u2019s not something you expect to get anything out, it\u2019s not your responsibility to do it for him. He can go on his own, and he\u2019ll get just as much out of it, if the counsellor is any use.", "NTA.\n\nObviously this is so you can show them to shut them up, since you very clearly know this isn't on you.  Your ex isn't your problem anymore, because he's your ex.  His therapy is on him, which it sounds like he should do, but you're not at all obligated to participate.", "NTA. That is fucking ridiculous.  I would have laughed at him and told him to fuck off too", "NAH it\u2019s a little weird to have asked but I don\u2019t think that makes him an asshole to ask. You probably should not have laughed about it though. I would have suggested he just go to individual therapy instead.", "Nta he thinks he can counsil his way back to a relationship with you, but yta for laughing in his face, you broke his heart have some empathy", "INFO: Any kids?", "Soft YTA. You didn't need to laugh. You could have politely Saud you understand where he's coming from, but no.", "YTA. Not for refusing the counseling but for being an ass about it.", "Everyone should go to therapy.  That being said, this is completely unnecessary.\n\nNTA", "Info: What does he mean by saying you put him there? I think it matters a little how toxic your relationship was. If you are still planning on having the same friend group it could be beneficial to talk things out.", "You didn\u2019t have to go to therapy but you basically laughed at him for having mental health issues. For your reaction \n\nYTA", "You've got two questions there, so you get two answers:\nYes, YTA for laughing (I don't blame you, but it's still not right).\nand\nNo, NTA for refusing with a giant fuck no to attending \"post breakup\" counselling with him.", "Sure his request is a bit outlandish, but that\u2019s all it was, *a request*. There was no need to laugh and decline his invitation like how you did. For doing that I gotta say that YTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
