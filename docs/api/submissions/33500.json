{"id": 33500, "submission_id": "18nkuw1", "title": "AITA for arguing with my mom over Lululemon gift cards?", "selftext": "I (27F) planned to buy my nieces (17F & 16F) $50 Lululemon gift cards each for Christmas, but wanted to wait until I got paid to get them. I told this to my dad (important for later). Yesterday, I had to go pick up my mom (70F) from her part-time job. On our way back to her house, we were talking when she suddenly says Oh btw, you owe me $100. Thinking she was joking, I asked why. When she had went out earlier, my dad (67M) told her I was buying Lululemon gift cards. She was by Lululemon, so she went in and bought 2 $150 gift cards, thinking that it would save me a trip and then she would put her name, my name and my dad\u2019s name on the gift cards. \n\nHere\u2019s where the argument starts. I told my mom that, while I appreciated it, that I wish she talked to me about buying the gift cards. I told her that, while she could tell the nieces that I helped with the gift, they are going to think the gift came from my parents, so then it looks like I didn\u2019t get them anything. Since moving out and getting a decent job, I\u2019ve been getting them gifts separate from my parents for years and I wrap the gifts myself and put my name on them so that they know I bought it.\n\nI also tried to explain that now instead of just going to the Lululemon, now I have to go find an ATM and get $100 out. We don\u2019t live in a bad neighborhood but I don\u2019t usually go to ATMs since I\u2019m worried about potentially being mugged, and since I use my card for everything. My mom doesn\u2019t have PayPal, Zelle, etc either, and I don\u2019t know where my checkbook is so the only way for me to pay her back is with cash. She said I don\u2019t have to pay her back right away, but I told her that wasn\u2019t the problem and that now, instead of me being able to get the gift cards and finish thinking about Christmas shopping, now I have to constantly be thinking about paying her back until I go get the cash. I also asked why she didn\u2019t call me about it, as I would have suggested her to buy 2 $100 Lululemon gift cards and then I would go buy my 2 $50 gift cards so then it would look like the girls had multiple gifts. \n\nShe got mad that it looked like I didn\u2019t appreciate what she did. When dad got involved later, he suggested I just go and buy the $50 gift cards like I planned and then the nieces get $200 for Lululemon so they can buy more stuff. I told him that, while not a bad idea, I know mom is going to keep bringing up how I owe her $100 if I don\u2019t give it to her and (as I\u2019m on a tight budget with a big trip I have planned next year) I don\u2019t want to have to spend $200 to satisfy everyone when I had only planned on spending $100. \n\nFor additional context, my nieces like more than just Lululemon, so it would have also been easy for her to go buy a different gift card for them at one of the other stores that was near where she was at. And we can\u2019t give my nieces cash as the oldest one will either use her money for bad things or will steal the cash from the younger niece and then use all of it for bad things. \n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1703157927, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18nkuw1/aita_for_arguing_with_my_mom_over_lululemon_gift/", "score": 57, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If this is a gift from your parents, then you don\u2019t owe them anything. If they bought the gift for you to give, and it would be your gift, then you shouldn\u2019t make it out like it\u2019s a gift from your parents, especially if your name will be on it and you will pay it back eventually. It\u2019ll still be your gift, just you weren\u2019t the original buyer. On that note, you wouldn\u2019t need to buy your daughters extra cards. It would just look like your parents didn\u2019t get them anything.", "NTA\n\n  \nSimply tell your mom. Sorry, i won't join your gift, because I want a separate gitft.

I don't owe you money. YOu bought those cards without my involvement, YOU pay for them.", "NTA. Your mom hijacked your gift idea and is trying to make you the bad guy for not being appreciative. \n\nEdit: I would get the nieces another gift and tell mom that I would not be paying her for stealing the gift idea. She stole it so she pays the price.", "NAH\n\nHowever if your niece wants to buy drugs she will just flog the gift card for half its value and go buy drugs. It's just cash with a conversation penalty and  extra steps.\n\nBut then she may do that for anything of  value you get her, addiction does that to people. \n\nThe real easy way to fix this stupid fight is just to tell them it's $50 from you and $100 from your parents if the perception of your contribution is that important. Or write it on the card or whatever. \n\nSure it's a little irritating your mum didn't ask, but it's such a non issue I think you are being about as irritating by making such a fuss over it. Neither of you rise to the level of asshole but you both sound tiresome.", "NTA. Your mom stole your gift idea and then tried to force you to pay for part of her gift without asking your permission first. You don't owe her any money.", "NTA- For those not understanding the problem perhaps a different view will help. I have a large extended family. If I get a birthday card from my aunt, uncle, and my adult cousins, I know that 100% my aunt bought the card and signed everyone\u2019s name. If there is a gift, she is responsible for that as well. I\u2019m an adult and I understand it\u2019s the easy thing to do, but a tiny part of me still wonders WTH is up with my cousins. They couldn\u2019t be bothered to at least sign a card? From the time my kids could write their names they signed anything like this. \n\nNot a big deal to some, but making it known that you are on your own, you aren\u2019t depending on mom and dad, and most importantly being proud that you are now adulting enough that you don\u2019t need mom and dad to subsidize gifts can be HUGE. A much smaller scale that living paycheck to paycheck and finally having a decent wage and savings! Or actually being able to afford a home instead of renting.", "Should your mother have touched base beforehand? Yep. Are you making this way too big of a deal? Yep. Not sure why you can\u2019t walk into your actual bank branch. Whether you visit the teller or an indoor ATM that most banks have, it\u2019s not the security risk you\u2019re making it out to be, nor do I understand why you think two teenagers won\u2019t be able to comprehend a gift coming from three people.\n\nYour mother made a misstep, but it wasn\u2019t done in malice. It\u2019s not something to be all in a tizzy about.", "Why is this even a big deal? So what if your name is also on the gift? And instead of going to one store which is in limited places, you head over to an ATM in a bank branch that has cameras which you\u2019re bound to find closer to you than a lululemon.  You won\u2019t get mugged.  Good grief.", "As petty as this may seem in the grand scene of things .. your mother majorly overstepped. She took over your gift entirely, bought it herself, and is now asking you for money towards it. \n\nNTA. This is likely not the first or last boundary she crosses.\n\nIf it\u2019s not a big deal, according to your parent\u2019s logic, they should have no problem accepting you buying them a different gift.", "NTA.  Mom is being lazy af.  Go get ur own gift.  Lululemon was your idea and would have been nice to be able\nTo give it to them yourself.  Also mom should have told you what she was doing.  This is just amateur hour", "This is enjoyably low stakes compared to the usual (probably fake) train wrecks on this sub. I fo agree it's annoying, and you're NTA, but I'd chalk this up to families sometimes being annoying. Make sure your nieces know you contributed.", "\"She got mad that it looked like I didn't appreciate what she did.\"\n\nBecause you DON'T appreciate what she did. She overstepped. Let them give the cards as a gift, you buy new cards to another store in the amount you originally planned. And don't let her guilt you about the extra $100. Shut it down once she brings it up.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. This is annoying to deal with, but your mother did not have ill intentions. Your niece is just going to sell the gift card for half of what y\u2019all paid for it if she is that bad off on drugs. I\u2019ve been sober for 10 months but I know that everyone I knew on drugs, myself included does this with every gift card we receive, even if it\u2019s a really cool store that we would love. *sighs* drugs ruin everything. Hope your niece decides enough is enough soon and seeks help.", "NTA Also don\u2019t pay your mom it\u2019s her own fault I feel like she did this just so u could \u201cowe\u201d her money", "YTA - much ado about nothing in my view.  Just tell your nieces you all contributed.  Surely going to the ATM is not such an ordeal.  Your parents didn't communicate with you but their reaction is not unreasonable.  You're creating issues where none exist. Relax!", "YTA.  \n\n\nYou are overthinking this. My bet is that your nieces will be happy they got 150$ to spend in that store.  \n\n\nYour mother just went ahead and bought it and as she said you can return the money whenever or you can suggest a deal where you'll do shopping for them in value of 100$ and you'll call it even. There are so many ways to solve this issue and if you want to give them something extra I'm sure you can find some Christmas card or something to go along with the gift cards.  \n\n\nYes your mother overstepped the boundary but it's not like something changed.", "Nta", "Light YTA. You're catastrophizing. Buy your mom a Visa gift card for $100 if you don't want to go to the ATM; you can get them at any drugstore or grocery store. Have your mom put all of your names on the gift cards. I'll upgrade to E.SH if she refuses to put your name on.", "ESH \n\nYour mother absolutely should have checked with you before purchasing the cards.\n\nYou are making a mountain out of a mole hill, so to speak.

Make it clear this was not helpful and she should have asked you but if this is the first time maybe go with it but make it clear you\u2019re not doing it again. All parents and teens go through these growing pains of adulthood. Be patient with your parents but firm. This is hard for them too", "NTA.

If she had stuck to your plan, you wouldn't have had to adjust things with 0 notice. \n\nAt the end of the day its not entirely about having to go to the bank or atm to get money, having your name tacked on to a gift, having to pay someone back, or having to pick a new place to get a gift card from. I will bet this is not the first time your mother has done something without any regard for you planning and effort and doesn't acknowledge that her making changes to your plans does not indeed make things easier.
