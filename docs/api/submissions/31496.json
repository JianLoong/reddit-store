She invited me to have dinner at her parents', and I said yes. Before I could arrive, though, she asked me whether I'd like there to be any vegetarian options.\n\nI told her that I'd prefer non-vegetarian stuff. She agreed to inform her parents about it. She later texted me to confirm that there would be non-vegetarian options as well. This was a week before before the date of the dinner.\n\nI arrived at the house she told me that the food was going to be vegan. She said that a friend of her father's (along with his son) would be arriving that day from somewhere else. It was a surprise visit in that they informed them whether they can come and my girlfriends' family said yes.\n\nAs they're vegan, they decided to change the cuisine.\n\nI was very much annoyed at that, but I kept my silence. The discussion was mostly turned towards them and they also barely seemed to recognize I was there while they had fun. In the end, though, her father actually told me \"We have to discuss something in private together, so perhaps you can leave to your house now?\"\n\nI got fed up at that and told them \"Oh, sure. You basically ask me what I'd like to have, bush that out at the last moment, and then hardly pay any attention to me before essentially asking me to fuck off at the end. I am disappointed in all of you, you guys are terrible hosts.\"\n\nThat resulted in a huge argument while Sandra accused me of not being accommodating, that I am being a child and that I should have been grateful I was even invited, etc. I left, but I wonder whether I did anything wrong.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1700666675, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/181blag/aita_for_calling_my_girlfriend_and_her_parents/", "score": 1085, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You blowing up ***heavily*** the first time you visit your GFs parents and calling them terrible? Yeah, you fucked up. Have some tact next time, and vent to your GF afterwards like a normal person.

You \\*could\\* have talked to your GF in private about it, that would probably have preserved feelings, but that makes their behaviour her problem. You provided the (rather blunt, but honest) feedback to those responsible. \n\nI think people are getting hung up on the 'I would prefer not-veggie options, given the choice' and reading this as 'I demanded they prepare meat drenched in cheese specifically for me'. You were asked your preference, you gave it, they disregarded it, made no attempt to make you feel welcome or included, then - in staggeringly rude terms - turfed you out so they could continue the gathering without you. \n\nI would not count on still having a GF after this episode, though.

FFS it's one meal, you can't suffer through a meal that has been prepared for you that doesn't have meat or animal byproducts in it? The thing about asking you to leave is indeed awkward, but IDK it strikes me as like a communication breakdown or something. It would be interesting to see what Sandra says about that bit. \n\nAnyway, yeah, YTA.

I'd leave that relationship because \"Sandra\" clearly never learned better and your relationship is obviously unequal in the manners department.  This is something that rarely changes.  My husband was a horrid hosts until someone I was hosting asked why hubs hated them.  After he left I broke.

The fact that it's inconsequential is besides the point, if it's the first thing you tell someone and you immediately go back on it then you've basically ruined any chance of them trusting you", "They didn\u2019t say shit to him until last minute. To be honest it\u2019s the least of why the parents are awful hosts", "Sounds like you\u2019ve stumbled upon the double standard in choosing your diet. \n\nFeel free to keep ignoring it though, assholes always do when it comes to themselves.", "i\u2019m not a vegetarian, and i\u2019m baffled as to why he was having such a big weird sulk about it.", "If it's unnecessary to let him know about the change in meal then he shouldn't have been asked about his food choice to begin with, this comes across as bit of bait and switch. \n\nRegardless, he ate it, the food singularly wasn't the issue. If the reaction was just based on food I'd vote y t a but it's the overall rude behavior of the hosts which makes the lashing out justified and nta", "If the non-vegan has to put up with vegan food on his plate, the vegan can put up with non-vegan food on the table.", "Yea and that\u2019s my point. Unless you are actually allergic, the foods wouldn\u2019t be touching, so you can deal with it. That\u2019s like saying I don\u2019t want someone to eat a certain dish just because it makes me uncomfortable, like if I thought the smell of fish was gross so a pescatarian can\u2019t eat next to me.", "Whatever.\n\nI can\u2019t even with this sub today lol", "If they had originally planned to serve chicken but the store was out so they switched to pork instead do they need to call OP in advance and grovel for forgiveness checking if it\u2019s okay?? Why is this any different?\n\nI agree the parents were rude (for other stuff) but it\u2019s crazy to think they needed to clear their menu with OP in advance. He\u2019s freaking 29, not a toddler lol. Just eat what is served and if you hate it, get something else on the way home.", "Same", "she asked if he preferred vegetarian food. that reads to me as asking about food restrictions (which have to be respected). then he stated a preference (which wasn't).\n\ntbh, I don't think the way he lashed out would ever be justified. it's a teenager sulk. go home, talk to your partner and her family politely at another time, don't act out in their home at a party. that's wild behavior"]}
