Tell her to go to Replacements ltd or eBay to buy a replacement part.", "What a lot of kerfuffle over something that is broken. If cannot be fixed. Move on.\n\nBtw, I just keep my butter in a random plastic container. It stays not the counter or weeks and has never gone moldy.", "You showed her the right way, she decided the husband has to be wrong and did the opposite, it broke, and that's supposed to be your fault? FFS...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nIs it a habit of her to blame others for her mistakes?

It\u2019s called a butter bell. I love it", "NTA\n\nYour wife sounds immature and is showing a pretty major red flag, blaming you for her own ignorance and lack of interest.

She's just mad it broke and is blaming you (wrongly).  Maybe try to fix it with a 2-part epoxy. That usually works best with ceramics.  Unless of course it shattered.", "NTA this is on her, she tried to be right about something she clearly didn't know.", "NTA - she just as easily could\u2019ve asked why you set it up that way. Instead, she was dismissive, and that attitude came back to bite her.", "NTA and wow that is toxic behavior.\n\nDid realize you had married a toddler I bet", "Your wife appears to have a short memory. It sounds like you tried once to show her the proper way to use this object (my family calls it a butter bell), and she ignored you. Then, as to be expected, she faced some natural consequences. How many times do you need to push her to listen? And at what point are you an asshole for pushing.\n\nMaybe next time she will accept your advice.\n\nNTA.", "NTA.

She said that I let her break it to prove a point.\n\nLOL, WHAT?!, are you sure she's 23?, she sounds 3...\n\nNTA, it's not your fault that she doesn't listen. Your wife still has a lot of growing up to do...", "Do you still have the pieces? Kintsugi repair might be an option. (Essentially, layers of lacquer, polished, and then finished with gold dust. It's beautiful. Avoid the Amazon epoxy kits, though, they aren't food safe. )", "I grew up using a french butter dish (aka \"butter bell\") and bought one for myself as soon as I was living on my own.  For those who may not know, butter stays fresh for a really long time when it is kept from air, and the water in the larger portion of the set prevents the butter from touching any air while allowing people to enjoy spreadable butter!\n\nI agree with many others who say it's broken, move on, but possibly your wife might enjoy you surprising her with another one. I personally love the Polish Pottery versions. They are very pretty and hold two sticks of butter, and also the butter-holding portion usually has little holes in it which help the butter not slide out as easily.  Polish pottery is also extremely durable for ceramics, which is the best part. They are hand-painted and not exactly cheap, but since they are meant to sit out I think they are a bit of art that is worth the extra expense.\n\nIf your wife is upset because she is afraid she has lost something that will help her remember her grandmother, she can transfer the memory of her grandmother to the new dish. Her grandmother surely would not want her to be upset over something so small (and breakable.) It is silly for your wife to blame you, but she actually is just sad that she broke it and wishes she had listened to you. I think it might be very sweet of you to try to get a nice replacement.
