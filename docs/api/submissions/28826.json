Tell her to go to Replacements ltd or eBay to buy a replacement part.", "What a lot of kerfuffle over something that is broken. If cannot be fixed. Move on.\n\nBtw, I just keep my butter in a random plastic container. It stays not the counter or weeks and has never gone moldy.", "You showed her the right way, she decided the husband has to be wrong and did the opposite, it broke, and that's supposed to be your fault?

It\u2019s called a butter bell. I love it", "NTA\n\nYour wife sounds immature and is showing a pretty major red flag, blaming you for her own ignorance and lack of interest.

She's just mad it broke and is blaming you (wrongly).  Maybe try to fix it with a 2-part epoxy. That usually works best with ceramics.  Unless of course it shattered.", "NTA this is on her, she tried to be right about something she clearly didn't know.", "NTA - she just as easily could\u2019ve asked why you set it up that way. Instead, she was dismissive, and that attitude came back to bite her.", "NTA and wow that is toxic behavior.\n\nDid realize you had married a toddler I bet", "Your wife appears to have a short memory. It sounds like you tried once to show her the proper way to use this object (my family calls it a butter bell), and she ignored you. Then, as to be expected, she faced some natural consequences. How many times do you need to push her to listen? And at what point are you an asshole for pushing.\n\nMaybe next time she will accept your advice.\n\nNTA.", "NTA.

She said that I let her break it to prove a point.\n\nLOL, WHAT?!, are you sure she's 23?, she sounds 3...\n\nNTA, it's not your fault that she doesn't listen. Your wife still has a lot of growing up to do...", "Do you still have the pieces? Kintsugi repair might be an option. (Essentially, layers of lacquer, polished, and then finished with gold dust. It's beautiful. Avoid the Amazon epoxy kits, though, they aren't food safe. )", "I grew up using a french butter dish (aka \"butter bell\") and bought one for myself as soon as I was living on my own.  For those who may not know, butter stays fresh for a really long time when it is kept from air, and the water in the larger portion of the set prevents the butter from touching any air while allowing people to enjoy spreadable butter!\n\nI agree with many others who say it's broken, move on, but possibly your wife might enjoy you surprising her with another one. I personally love the Polish Pottery versions. They are very pretty and hold two sticks of butter, and also the butter-holding portion usually has little holes in it which help the butter not slide out as easily.  Polish pottery is also extremely durable for ceramics, which is the best part. They are hand-painted and not exactly cheap, but since they are meant to sit out I think they are a bit of art that is worth the extra expense.\n\nIf your wife is upset because she is afraid she has lost something that will help her remember her grandmother, she can transfer the memory of her grandmother to the new dish. Her grandmother surely would not want her to be upset over something so small (and breakable.) It is silly for your wife to blame you, but she actually is just sad that she broke it and wishes she had listened to you. I think it might be very sweet of you to try to get a nice replacement.

She wanted to be taken seriously as an expert while having no expert knowledge, like, she wanted everyone to pretend along with her that she knew this or that. She could never channel that need for instant gratification into a drive to learn things and get real, earned accolades for true knowledge and understanding. A pretender 'til the end.", "I keep a plate in the cupboard so flies, dogs and cats can't get to it and use it for everything so it never sits longer than a few days.", "I love my butter dish. It's a small, handcrafted piece of stoneware that I got at a farmer's market. It was intended to be a soap dish, but I knew the short fat sticks of butter we have here on the West Coast would fit on it perfectly so I got it (I checked to make sure the glaze was food safe).\n\nThat being said...a taco truck butter dish??? That sounds WAY more awesome than mine!", "> My \"butter dish\" is a ceramic taco truck.\n\nAnd now I need a ceramic taco truck.\n\n[Well, what do you know?](https://www.amazon.com/Boston-Warehouse-Covered-Butter-Standard/dp/B08PMYNFB1/ref=sr_1_1?crid=19PND2IX5LVAX&keywords=taco+truck+butter+dish&qid=1697242194&sprefix=taco+truck+bu%2Caps%2C226&sr=8-1)", "I wouldn't be surprised if that's the case. Same thing happens with maple syrup. Traditionally it would have most of the water boiled off until it was almost pure sugar, very thick, and subsequently shelf stable. The pure maple syrup I buy at the store has to be refrigerated after opening because it's much thinner. Still delicious, and *very* sweet but it would have to be cooked down to probably half its volume to not mould on the shelf.", "My grandmother lived alone and only used butter very occasionally.  It would sometimes go moldy because she kept it just in a dish in the cupboard (she was used to kitchens with an unheated larder area and even with the introduction of central heating couldn't get out of the habit). Fat content was about 80% but she would leave it for months at a time (and in a cool larder it would have survived).", "I've churned my own butter from cream, it's as authentically butter as you can imagine, and it can definitely go moldy and deteriorate much faster than commercial products stored with similar care (which I've never seen mold on). I wonder if the distinction is that small batch butters from home and farm have more traces of buttermilk left behind that will cause the butter to go bad, where larger commercial operations can more completely separate the components so that the butter has fewer contaminants. If you get breadcrumbs or other spreads mixed into the butter that is probably a vector for that kind of problem too.\n\nEven if mold isn't an issue (it's more or less likely depending on where you live) unsalted butter is still going to go bad eventually, much faster if not stored thoughtfully.", "80% is also the minimum in the US, I suspect something must have contaminated the butter for it to go bad that quickly, especially in the fridge. I prefer salted butter and that will stay good for weeks even on the counter.", "That's silly it's not a family heirloom it's a butter bell. The grandma is also still alive and I'm sure she has much better keepsakes than an old jar for butter. Maybe I'm a grouch but getting sentimental over this is dumb.", "The premise of the comment is that it\u2019s not his fault she broke it but he didn\u2019t need to say I told you so.

Only that he set it up. Wife's complaint - he didn't explain it. See above. Perhaps if they set it up together she could have learnt something. \n\n>My wife says I should have explained better why she was wrong.\n\nOP takes the time to explain to all of us internet strangers the importance of the water. Did he explain it to his wife too? Info requested \n\n>It is a ceramic bowl roughly the size of a large mug with no handle. The lid has a smaller bowl attached to it and when you put it on the smaller bowl fits inside the bigger bowl UPSIDE DOWN. That is important to the story. The bigger bowl has some water in it. *That keeps the butter cool and forms an airtight seal to protect the butter.*\n\nI'll chalk the response up to frustration.

How lids work?", "yeah, but certain things like ops might not be as easy because those two pieces where very specifically fitted together, and they plan on using it for its intended purpose not just for decoration so if it doesn't properly fit it could very easily break/.", "This is why she\u2019s sad. She\u2019s not upset at OP, she\u2019s upset that she broke something that held so many memories for her.

Should it only have sentimental value after her grandmother dies? You can get gifts from still-living people that you value deep.", "My grandma gave me most of the kitchen stuff she used daily when she no longer felt up to cooking. Nothing technically special.

No amount of money can bring back the only happy memories of my childhood, unlike that stupid wonderful kitchen stuff.", "Lol why all the down votes? I admitted to being a grouch I don't get sentimental over most things I moved a lot as a kid and learned everything is replaceable keep your memories everything else is temporary.
