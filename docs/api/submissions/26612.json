I agreed to watch while they meet up with friends. About 5 hours after they were gone, poor kid is crying inconsolably. I text back and forth with them over text for a few minutes, let them know the kid is done with it and they might want to head back now. They make clear that they are not coming back until they are done hanging out.  I couldn't believe it. When they show up almost 2 hrs later, I hand the kid off - still crying, pick up my stuff, and walk out. I couldn't have had a calm conversation at that point with them at that moment. I didn't sit for them again until the kid was a couple of years older.\n\nSome people don't appreciate a good thing when they have it.", "NTA Your sister let herself give in to the temptation to stay temporarily free from her kids longer than the agreed upon time. I've made that mistake once, too. It's a good way to suddenly not have a babysitter anymore. A lot of parents need to learn that lesson.", "NTA! Your sister and her friend were disrespectful to you, then when called out, your sister blamed you for\u2026. feeling upset at having been disrespected? She\u2019s the asshole. Definitely set some boundaries about how you deserve to be treated!", ">has gotten my mom in the middle of it telling my mom I stormed off and was rude to her friend.\n\nYour sister is automatically the asshole. You're both adults, mom isn't part of this and you were rude to your sister and her friend for lying to you and making you stay up until after midnight. Remember her behavior for the future.
