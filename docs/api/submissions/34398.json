My husband was super supportive at that time and despite me never asking him to, he stopped drinking as well. He's not an alcoholic but he did have drinking problems (not knowing limits when he did drink or making stupid decisions that even I wouldn't have made). So, we both stopped drinking together and again, I never asked him to do this.\n\nWell, we moved back to his home town 2 months ago and he started drinking again, socially. I have no issue with this. I simply didn't want it in the house and he agreed to that. He could even sit out in our garage and drink and I wouldn't care. I just physically do not want it in the house. I don't want to see it because it is still hard for me. But there have been 2-3 separate occasions where he will walk inside with an open beer and just set it down on the counter and forget about it and go open another beer in the garage, leaving his basically full beer on the counter. And I fucked up one night and I drank one. It was 2 weeks ago. It was at that point that I fully realized I would never be able to drink, even in moderation, because that one beer started what I could only describe as a \"frenzy\". I wanted more and was immediately pissed off that I didn't have more. So I talked to my husband about it and he apologized and said he would be more mindful and not bring it near the house and all went back to normal. But last night he shows up with his buddy and he had a beer with him. Set it next to the TV when he went to the bathroom (I was watching TV). He then went outside, leaving it inside. So, I dumped it. As I'm dumping it, he came inside and asked me why I was dumping his last beer and that he \"only left it for 2 fucking seconds\". I told him from now on, anything brought in this house will be dumped and if he can't respect my one request, he can leave (I own the house). I'm not spiraling because of him. Respect it or go. He says I'm being overdramatic.\n\nETA: commenters are right. Me being an alcoholic is NOT his problem and I made it very clear in my post that I understood that. I don't care that he drinks. But he was in full agreement that he wouldn't bring it in to the house because I communicated that it was hard for me and continued to do so.

Would he insist on having peanuts in the house if she were allergic? Would he smoke in the house even if she were on oxygen? There are many examples of people making accommodations for a partner's health issues. His refusal to accept this need is a sign of his own problem with alcohol.

You may have been harsh is telling him to leave because you own the house and because of that I give you a small AH point. But at the end of the day he needs to respect your boundaries.", "NTA", "NTA.  He's doing exactly what he promised he wouldn't do.", "NTA of course.\n\nThe focus of most of the comments is how your husband is being so unsupportive of your staying sober by putting temptation in front of you.  And he is being terrible for this.  You have to protect yourself. However, it seems that another real problem is that your husband is an alcoholic also, and now that he's drinking again your sobriety probably feels like a rebuke, hence the sabotage. (When drinking he doesn't know limits, makes poor decisions, anger issues, etc.) It's going to be an ongoing problem.", "Nta I think you\u2019re being reasonable about it, congrats on your sobriety", "\\>I told him from now on, anything brought in this house will be dumped and if he can't respect my one request, he can leave (I own the house). I'm not spiraling because of him. Respect it or go. He says I'm being overdramatic.\n\nYou're NTA for setting firm boundaries. I understand that he's just being forgetful, I forget little things all the time, but this is something that should be much more sensitive considering your addiction. He married you knowing your addiction, and your sobriety, and while he wants to drink socially, having alcohol anywhere near you is just incredibly dangerous. \n\nThat being said, I think pulling the 'I own the house' card was a bit much.", "NTA.\n\nI give you so much credit.  \n\nYour husband's friend was out of line.  He knows that you are a recovering alcoholic and he left a beer in your home.  That's an asshole move.\n\nYour dumping it was self-preservation.  Never be ashamed of preserving your health and sanity.", "You say that your alcoholism is your responsibility, but then towards the end of your post you said you are spiraling because of him.  No, you are spiraling because of you, You are the one who chose  to drink the beer. You are responsible for your actions. Your lack of willpower is on you alone.", "Yta. Part of the relearning (cause no one actually recovers from addictions) is living with possible triggers.", "NTA.  Your husband sure is.  You asked him not to bring it in the house.  How hard is it to put the beer down before you walk in the door?  Your husband is being selfish & careless.  He is not treating your disease as a priority & it should be.  You're not being overdramatic.  Your husband is not seeing this as a problem & that's the problem!  He is completely disrespecting you.  I don't blame you for telling him to leave.  And, I'm sorry, but your husband does have a drinking problem.  One that probably needs to be addressed sooner rather than later.", "YTA:  He made a mistake, and you went all scorched earth, telling him he can leave.  If I was him, id pack my stuff, and leave you a beer in the fridge for when you realized what you had done.", "It may be your problem but he is your husband and should support you.\nThat means no alcohol in the home at all.", "NTA\n\n\n\nHe needs to leave your home. He is never going to respect your boundaries for sobriety.\n\nTime to move on from him... Move elsewhere if you need to and just go back to renting out your home.", "NTA for being upset your husband is bringing beer inside after agreeing not to. But YTA for marrying someone who you expected to go through your personal battles with you and for you. \n\nI grew up with one alcoholic and one who wasn\u2019t. When one had to quit, they didn\u2019t expect the other to as well. The fact that you couldn\u2019t be left alone with a beer for a minute in your house is YOUR problem to work through, not your husband\u2019s. Also shitty of you to say it\u2019s your house so your rules stand and he has no say. You\u2019re MARRIED. It\u2019s abusive to use the roof over your husband\u2019s head against him. Wtf", "NTA you are not being overdramatic you had clear boundaries and he violated them. you put these boundaries in place to keep you safe and he's endangering you by violating them. even if it isn't intentional it still signifies a lack of care that i would be concerned about.", "NTA. As an alcoholic you should not put yourself in situations that you can\u2019t handle instead of asking for accommodations in public, but in your home? That\u2019s a different matter entirely. He changed the status quo and you honestly have a fair rule, if any beer is left unattended it goes down the drain. If he wants to have a drink he can tape it to his hands", "To OP: NTA.\n\nTo OP's husband: WTF?\n\nTo OP: Good for you for your sobriety.  I won't pretend to know what it's like to kick that, but I know myself well enough to be confident if I had that addiction I would probably not be able to overcome it.  My absolute respect for your determination, will and strength.  Although I do not have that addiction, I know that a key to overcoming most addictions is to stay the hell away from it.  When it's around, the temptation to have just a sip is greater than when it isn't. If you think you need an alcohol free house (and that would make sense), you need an alcohol free house.\n\nTo OP's husband.  Again, WTF?  This is supposed to be the woman you love.  This is supposed to be the woman you want to and will support.  This is supposed to be the woman you want to live her best life.  Why would you bring alcohol around when you know the potential to trigger her?  Are you really that selfish?", "NTA - your husband should be more supportive of your sobriety. Maybe he needs to attend an Al-Anon familys group? Talk to other spouses of alcoholics, get some support for himself.", "NTA. Being an alcoholic might be your problem, not his, but I have a hard time understanding a supposedly loving husband exposing his wife to something she struggles with over and over like this.", "NTA.\n\nYou set a reasonable boundary. He can either, as you put it:\n\n> Respect it or go", "Good for you for setting boundaries", "NAH. I get that he\u2019s a little irritated, and I wouldn\u2019t call him an AH for this one, but he needs to start taking supporting your sobriety more seriously. You\u2019d discussed this with him and acted accordingly. No big deal, so far, time for him to step up.", "I can see both sides on this one.\n\nNAH.", "NTA my mum is a alcohol dependent, basically meaning she was a alcoholic but had standards such as she ONLY drank after 7pm and could go without it without symptoms. This is her second sobriety and its been 1 year. The first thing my stepdad did is chuck all his alcohol out without her asking for it. She didnt actually need him to do that as she went cold turkey and has once felt tempted but he wanted to show his support. Her one rule is if he does drink could he sleep aswel as the smell of the booze on him makes her physically ill, so he happily sleeps on the sofa because he wants to support her. Your rule isnt a big deal, your not asking him to not drink, your asking for consideration to be a recovering alcoholic.", "NTA\n\nIf you have to remove your temptations from yourself to help yourself so be it. If he's bringing it into your own house there is zero reason why he gets the choice over you. You can only control yourself and this is the best way. \n\nAs someone whos brother died when I was 11 and have a family of alcoholics, and I also struggle with alcohol issues myself, I understand where you're coming from and even if I didn't experience those things, it's clear as day how valid your position is.\n\nGL through the rest of your journey", "You are the asshole. And I'm fucking leaving. I own the house ,gunna hold that shit over my head. I don't need you I can get my own house without. You.", "NTA! It's a VERY reasonable request.", ">reddit has a bug up its ass where \"you're responsible for your own sobriety!!!!!!\" and it's true, but this is you ensuring you are in control of your own sobriety.\n\nThat's true, and to your point if someone in your life is threatening your sobriety it's up to you to neutralize the threat to it. In this case she discussed it with her husband multiple times but he keeps violating the ask, I don't think these types of people can really blame her for getting upset. Eventually it'll come down to removing him if he doesn't change, unfortunately.", "It did say \u201cwe moved into HIS home\u201d", "Yep. NTA. Even if he wasn\u2019t your husband, it\u2019s basic courtesy.", "\"I'm probably going to get downvoted to hell for commenting in line with literally every comment from two hours before I post this\"\n\nLol come on man, your take was so standard and uncontroversial.", "She has established that she needs an alcohol-free home. That\u2019s not an unusual way for an alcoholic to responsibly defend their sobriety. And she is taking responsibility. But with that need, either he has to stop bringing alcohol in or she has to cut off his access to her home. Again, doing that *is* her taking responsibility, because she has identified the weak spots and is determining how to prevent them.", "They moved back there \u2014 she\u2019s lived there before, even if she\u2019s not from there.", "The negative downvotes speak for themselves, it's irrelevant here anyway. \n\nYTA jesus it's beer, not a fucking long island. He brings it inside for maybe 5 minutes, honestly you have self-control issues. Smoke a joint", "You sound a lot like my girlfriend. I used to have major alcohol dependency issues that I eventually got over to a point where I can occasionally drink socially without worrying about relapsing. We mostly only drink when we're out or at someone's house, but my girlfriend has a very well stocked liquor cabinet so we sometimes have a cocktail or two at her house. There was a period a year or so ago where I was feeling extremely stressed and started to find the liquor cabinet too tempting. When I told her, she immediately cleared out all of the bottles and hid them somewhere. She also did the same thing after my mom passed without me saying anything because she knew I might be tempted to drink as a way to cope. As you say, if you love someone, you should be willing to adapt to help them if possible.", "It says that they moved back to his home town. The house is owned by OP according to the comments", "Very much NTA. As the spouse of dry alcholic I can say that if I am not able to provide the person I love with a Safe Space in their very own home, then that is a HUGE problem.", "Well excuse me. None of the comments I read said that \ud83e\udee0", "You need to go back and compare times if you\u2019re saying \u201cliterally every comment from two hours before i post this\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve only seen two main comments that say the same thing, and those were commented around the same time as mine \ud83d\ude44\n\nGet the stick out of your ass \ud83d\ude18", "I do not agree", "Especially since OP\u2019s alcoholism seems to have been obvious from the get-go. Alcoholics often bond with people who make them feel better about their own drinking. \n\nNot respecting very reasonable and agreed-upon boundaries that protect a loved one\u2019s health, and getting very angry about it when confronted, point to a problem of his own.", "Wow butthurt enough to comment twice, man you can\u2019t just laugh at yourself can you", "Most of the comments here are two hours older than yours, and I was poking fun. No need to get so butthurt", "> The response is a bit out of line. Saying he should leave the house she bought because he left a drink inside on accident is not how strong marriages work.\n\nOP isn\u2019t saying that. She\u2019s saying that he\u2019ll have to leave if he doesn\u2019t stop making these \u201cmistakes\u201d. He didn\u2019t even take ownership of the \u201cmistake\u201d, but blamed her for dumping the drink that should never have been within her reach in their home. She needs him to properly commit to keeping alcohol out of the house, and if he won\u2019t \u2014 which he currently is not \u2014 then she\u2019s going to have to ensure it by removing his access to the house.", "\u201cYou aren\u2019t fun anymore since you stopped drinking.\u201d Someone said this to me once and I - wisely - ran.", "Because there\u2019s nothing to laugh at?", "Thank you for letting me know!", "Was kind of getting this vibe. He's left it out so many times.. and in direct view of OP. It's just too weird. \n\nStick to your guns, OP.", "The page OP has established that she needs to be on is that there is no alcohol in her home."]}
