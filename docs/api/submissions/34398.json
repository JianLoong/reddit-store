My husband was super supportive at that time and despite me never asking him to, he stopped drinking as well. He's not an alcoholic but he did have drinking problems (not knowing limits when he did drink or making stupid decisions that even I wouldn't have made). So, we both stopped drinking together and again, I never asked him to do this.\n\nWell, we moved back to his home town 2 months ago and he started drinking again, socially. I have no issue with this. I simply didn't want it in the house and he agreed to that. He could even sit out in our garage and drink and I wouldn't care. I just physically do not want it in the house. I don't want to see it because it is still hard for me. But there have been 2-3 separate occasions where he will walk inside with an open beer and just set it down on the counter and forget about it and go open another beer in the garage, leaving his basically full beer on the counter. And I fucked up one night and I drank one. It was 2 weeks ago. It was at that point that I fully realized I would never be able to drink, even in moderation, because that one beer started what I could only describe as a \"frenzy\". I wanted more and was immediately pissed off that I didn't have more. So I talked to my husband about it and he apologized and said he would be more mindful and not bring it near the house and all went back to normal. But last night he shows up with his buddy and he had a beer with him. Set it next to the TV when he went to the bathroom (I was watching TV). He then went outside, leaving it inside. So, I dumped it. As I'm dumping it, he came inside and asked me why I was dumping his last beer and that he \"only left it for 2 fucking seconds\". I told him from now on, anything brought in this house will be dumped and if he can't respect my one request, he can leave (I own the house). I'm not spiraling because of him. Respect it or go. He says I'm being overdramatic.\n\nETA: commenters are right. Me being an alcoholic is NOT his problem and I made it very clear in my post that I understood that. I don't care that he drinks. But he was in full agreement that he wouldn't bring it in to the house because I communicated that it was hard for me and continued to do so.

Even if you take out the alcohol component, it's a dick move to be so callous about any shared understanding or agreement as a couple.

Would he insist on having peanuts in the house if she were allergic? Would he smoke in the house even if she were on oxygen? There are many examples of people making accommodations for a partner's health issues. His refusal to accept this need is a sign of his own problem with alcohol. For someone who isn't an alcoholic, this isn't an issue. Plus, drinking occasionally at a pub is A LOT cheaper than a divorce.", "Agreed, NTA.

It's ok if you don't like him drinking at home. If his behavior is making your struggles worse than that sucks.\n\nAlso you might be downplaying his alcoholism a bit.
