My wife and I have 2 vehicles. My sister and her husband have 1. My sister and I both work full time. My sister's husband hasn't worked in 8 months. My wife hasn't worked for a bit due to some mental health issues surrounding this pregnancy and me suggesting she just stay home full time while she's in therapy and essentially baking our baby. I have no issue with her staying home and \"doing nothing\" (these are NOT my words- will be of importance later). I prefer it this way. She is able to spend time with our kids and work on herself while doing so. \n\nFor the past 2 weeks my wife has been expressing she's stressed out due to my sister, her husband and their kids. At first it was just an annoyance because their younger kid was over to our house frequently and she can be a handful and loud (ADHD). But this slowly turned in to my wife just being full on pissed because my sister started asking my wife for rides. Like, bringing her daughters places or driving the oldest daughter to job interviews or bringing her kids to the beach/park/trails whenever she would bring our children to do anything. Now, my sister works long hours so I know she's experiencing burn out but this isn't exactly my problem, nor is it my wife's. \n\nYesterday my wife was livid because when I was at work, my sister came over and asked her to drive her two kids to a concert out of state (5 hour drive) because my sister was \"too tired\" after working. When my wife said no, my sister refused to take her seriously. \"Well you're not doing anything anyways\", \"it's not like you're working\", \"my husband can watch your kids\" (hard no). So I went to talk to my sister and in front of her husband and kids told them they had better stop expecting my heavily pregnant and mentally ill wife to be their Uber service and that I didn't give a fuck if they were burnt out or not and basically told the husband to get off his lazy ass and do something for his kids for once. My sister was crying and saying \"I was just asking for help\" because of how tired she is and apparently her husband all the sudden has a bad back. My mom says I'm a complete AH and has taken over driving those kids everywhere.", "created_utc": 1687702299, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14in9ns/aita_for_making_my_family_feel_bad_for_asking_for/", "score": 76, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She's the type who says \"you were helping me because I needed you so don't expect anything in return\" types.", "My wife said no and wasn't taken seriously. She didn't take those girls to the concert so she did stick with it. She didn't cave.", "So it\u2019s okay for BIL to not work and not take care of his own kids. But op\u2019s wife has to take care of sisters kids because she\u2019s not working?", "Why didn't bil drive the kids? He had a car. The back problems have been unknown to the family for 8 months? Not likely.", "It\u2019s great that your wife didn\u2019t care. If you hadn\u2019t been firm with your sister and her husband they\u2019d keep acting that way.

I said the opposite of that.", "It\u2019s not denigrating the BIL. It\u2019s calling out sisters double standard", "Except OP called out his sister\u2019s double standard by attacking her husband *in front of her husband.*  For all any of us (including OP) knows, her husband had a very legitimate reason why he can\u2019t work or drive for ten hours round trip.  But now the BIL is painfully aware that OP thinks he\u2019s some lazy loser because of it.  That was cruel. \n\nThink about it, if anyone told OP\u2019s wife she is a lazy loser for not working right now, would you not  think that person was TA?", "BIL doesn\u2019t watch his own kid - \u201ctheir younger kid was over to our house frequently\u201d but somehow is going to watch op\u2019s two kids?\n\nHe doesn\u2019t drive his children to anything - \u201cbringing her daughters places or driving the oldest daughter to job interviews\u201d\n\nSo yeah. He doesn\u2019t do anything for his own kids. I\u2019m going to say he\u2019s lazy if he doesn\u2019t step for for his own kids while expecting op\u2019s wife to drive 5 hours", "You are conflating the BIL\u2019s actions with the sister\u2019s actions.", "When did the BIL offer to drive his own kids around? Or find an alternate plan? Clearly not before the sister asked op\u2019s wife", "You seem determined to ignore what I am saying, which is that the BIL may not have been able to do the drive for some reason.  If he has significant back issues due to an injury, he may not be able to drive that long due to pain issues.  And/or he could be dealing with other issues that make it unsafe for him to take in that kind of responsibility for his kids.  Ever heard of the opioid crisis?  How do you think people get addicted to opioids in the first place?  And have you ever learned about what it\u2019s like to get off of opioids once you are addicted?  \n\nI have no way of knowing if that\u2019s what the BIL is going through, or if it\u2019s something else, or nothing at all.  But neither do you, you are just adopting OP\u2019s assumptions that there is nothing going on because that\u2019s easier than considering that OP might also be TA here.  Just because someone is TA to you doesn\u2019t justify acting like TA to everyone else around them.", "I do understand what you\u2019re saying but I still think op was justified. BIL needed to hear it that he needs to step up for his own children. BIL has been enabling SIL to put these unreasonable demands on op\u2019s wife rather than helping her to find other solutions.", "NTA", "NTA - Your wife needs to take care of herself and just say 'no'.   I know it's family but sometimes you have to say no to even family.   Tell your Mom she's free to drive anyone anywhere but warn her not to be used.", "NTA.  Glad you stood up for your wife.

I never said he was TA for not having his wife drive the kids.", "Except it was not gratuitous in my opinion.   If OP' sister starts trying to set down rules, OP has the right to response"]}
