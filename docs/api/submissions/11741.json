However, I'm only at the apartment in the evenings, around 9pm, and leave at 6 am.\n\nRegardless, I've never had a problem with him. However, yesterday, I was at the hospital, and our attending decided we could have the rest of the day off due to the lack of movement.\n\nI was excited as this was around 3:30pm, and I really looked forward to some rest. I went home and even got some takeout on the way. I got to my apartment at roughly 4:30, and as I approached the door, I heard quite some noises which I thought were really odd.\n\nRegardless, I wasn't really paying much attention and opened the door. What I didn't expect was to see four people in my apartment, three of them naked, in my living room, doing the nasty very aggressively. The other one, RECORDING everything.\n\nI closed the door instantly, hit it and screamed, \"What the hell you people think you're doing!\". It took a few moments for my roommate to open the door again, and when I thought he was gonna explain, he very angrily said, \"What are you doing here so early?\"\n\nNow, what transpired next was a series of insults between both parties.

However, it never came to him to ASK ME if he could use our apartment or, specifically, the common areas to do that.\n\nI refused to stay there yesterday and crashed on a friends couch. Apparently, he's quite angry at me for \"ruining his shoot\", or so his texts say. Now, I'm gonna find myself another place.\n\nBut hear this insanity out. My friend, told me that he thinks I might have over-reacted.

He not only soiled your joint furniture but also exposed you to legal liability along with him.\nWhat I don't get is why you are letting him get away with it? It's not like you walked in on him making love to his SO.\n\nIn any case, NTA.", "\u201cOh, you\u2019re right, I came home early, that totally makes me the shitty person.\u201d\nNTA.", "NTA", "NTA!\n\n\nNo, you're not insane OP! PLEASE get out and lose contact with them all! Jesus...", "You know, normally when the person who submits the AITA post is so certain that they\u2019re obviously right I get annoyed at the presumption. \n\nThis is not one of those times. Absolutely NTA and he\u2019s insane to think he\u2019s the wronged party.", "Identifiable space means it could identify you due to shared common areas, so nta. You should have had a say", "NTA  \nHis room is free game  \nBut the COMMON AREA is not, I would have been livid.  \n\n\nNot only is it disgusting (as I highly doubt they were being sanitary in an armature porno) it could be detrimental to your career.  \nIf any friends/family saw that and was like \"hey... isn't that (OP's name) living room?\" or hell it could have even had a picture of you in the background on it and future jobs could easily see that.", "Make some extra money, be the angry roommate who has to smash  his girl.", "NTA. That's fucking gross.", "LOL, you didn't ruin his shot, you just made his video into a cuck video.\n\nNTA", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 NTA", "NTA \n\nIn his room? You would be in the wrong \n\nIn public shared space. \n\nNo fucking way dude. So gross", "NTA, but, have you considered demanding that since it was taking place in a common area of the apartment that you pay rent for, that you should get some of that money.\n\nIt\u2019s petty, but I\u2019m a petty person and I\u2019d demand some of that porn money.", "NTA That is absolutely vile, and you need a new friend if they even hinted that you might be in the wrong here. Absolutely unacceptable behaviour, your roommate can do whatever they want in their room but not the living room.", "ESH. You over reacted by screaming like a loon. You should have just went in, and went to your room and enjoyed your food. They should just reshoot and get it done, no need to be upset.  And ya all need to learn to communicate when your Gonna have projects and company in shared space. Grow up.", "Depends on how hot the chicks were.", "Genuine question - for you or the crowd - would you feel as angry if it weren\u2019t porn? If it were just two people on the couch? \n\nI\u2019ve lived with a lot of roommates and I kinda always assumed they\u2019ve had sex in common areas? As long as they were responsible and cleaned up?\n\nNTA FWIW. he definitely should\u2019ve cleared this with you beforehand.", "Maybe your accidentally walking in was supposed to be part of the script? #MissedOpportunity", "Say what? A bunch of gay homeless guys making porn in your place? And one was a midget? You gotta draw the line somewhere,...hahaha", "NTA, and his anger and blaming you for arriving at your own home at a reasonable hour, and thinking you overreacted is bizarre.", "Bro wtf? Are you really being downbad right now?", "Overreacting? How would you react in a situation like this? OP don\u2019t know these people, there could be bodily fluids on the couch, and OP has no idea what any of these other people have", "[deleted]", "Sex work is fine but not in common areas and without some sort of agreement.", ">If it was confined to his room then he has the right to do his thing\n\nI doubt that. Virtually every lease prohibits stuff like this.", "Many leases state that commercial businesses cannot be run in the home. It could be a breach of insurance policies as well. Like I said, if eviction didn\u2019t work I\u2019d leave myself and feel pretty confident arguing my case in front of a judge if it came to it.", "Pretty sure that boat sailed when roommate decides to shoot porn in the common areas without warning.", "If it\u2019s my roommate\u2026 I explain that it\u2019s wrong to do this in the living room without telling me. It was wrong of him to be pissed at OP for interrupting, but ultimately the big problem is just a lack of communication. If I were OP, I also would have texted my roommate if I was coming home early, JUST IN CASE. Idk if they have friends or dates over when I\u2019m not usually there. It\u2019s just polite.", "What I do wonder though is if the roommate had been in his bedroom doing the same thing as he was in the living room is if the OP still would have been angry? The OP may not have been as angry but my guess is that she still would have been angry.", "OP said 3.. So 3 sweaty nekkid fluidy people allllll over shared furniture... Who knows how many times or how well the clean up was handled or if anyone was tested...", "This made me laugh. Thanks for that \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "sure.", "I\u2019m thinking I\u2019d just flat out die of shock. That\u2019s gross beyond my worst nightmare.", "Also arguably a health hazard because you dont know the health of those people, they could very well have STDs and are spreading it IN THE COMMON ROOM. This is a risk to OP and anyone who sit in there and are none the wiser.", "Just..a couple questions here: 1. Does amateur porn count as a commercial business? 2. I guess maybe my roommates and I are just gross, but we definitely all still joke that we all fucked on a couch in the apartment we all shared at one time or another. I\u2019m not seeing how this would be different enough to take it in front of a judge. But I\u2019m definitely curious.", "I wouldn't care because that's his room. But like, even if your roommate has what you think a predictable schedule, I've been sent home early from school and my husband from work with no notice. This is how cheaters get caught sometimes. Do that in your room, not the god damn living room. It's like that story about how a girl had her mother drop something off and the mother walked in on a roommate with a different roommate's boyfriend on the couch. You are just ASKING to be caught.", "Why does OP have to give the roommate notice that they would be home earlier? How bout not filming a fuck scene in a shared space without having the appropriate conversation first.", "And OP is going into the medical field, their name could be searched and there could be something in the background that could attach their existence to this video\u2026", "It really is honestly", "\"and posting it online to make some extra cash\" is the part that makes it a commercial business", "In many states it is against the law to film commercial porn in a residence without a permit.", "With all the people who do onlyfans and pornhub its highly doubtful you'd get kicked out of your apartment for filming some porn..", "I agree that he shouldn't have been doing it in a public space for both roommates. I'm trying to figure out how this derailed into people cheating on their spouses or significant others. I would agree NTA in this case by the way.", "Also the fact that the roommate got aggressive when confronted", "So would, say, having a YouTube channel count as a commercial business?", "I agree with you, but the \u201clegal experts\u201d of Reddit apparently do not", "I was saying that doing things, especially in the open, can lead to situations where you get caught. Such as surprises showing up. It's not the same thing exactly, but you can't count on someone not coming home by surprise like OPs roommate did", "To say that the participating people are strangers to the roommate is presumptive. For all we know, they\u2019re his friends and he wouldn\u2019t let them steal from his apartment. Like, I just feel like that\u2019s a stretch to say that because he\u2019s filming a porno, that he and his friends are total degenerates.", "If you make an income from it it certainly is considered one...?  Youtube even specifically tells you to treat it like one if you plan to earn income.", "Yes if it's monetized and you're receiving money from Ad Sense and such, then yes it counts and you HAVE to report the income. In other words, if you get a tax form from Google/YouTube it all has to be reported...", "Yeah. that's why I've learned to take what most people say on here with a huge grain of salt.", "Gotcha. I now understand the context of your statement. It's kind of like the time whenever I was in sixth grade that I bought a page of Hustler from a classmate and dry humped it in the closed den. My dad walked in, looked at me, shook his head, and then left. I was really embarrassed lol \ud83e\udd23", "I never said he and his friends were degenerates because they were filming a porno. I was just pointing out what people can think of if put in that situation. We have to presume because the roommate is withholding details. He didn't even bother to give OP the heads up that people would be there. \n\nAnd how do you think it's a stretch for stealing to happen? Best friends steal from their friends. Family steals from family. Roommates steal from roommates and guests steal from hosts. It's not a 100% thing that someone WILL steal from you but being put in a situation where you have an unknown number of people coming in and out of your house without you knowing raises the statistical likelihood of SOMETHING being taken or at the least destroyed.\n\nHis roommate must have super multitasking skills if he can be balls deep in someone in a living room while simultaneously keeping his eyes on everyone in the house without missing a thing. Maybe he is anal enough to take a daily inventory. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "And you think that a judge would evict a tenant for running a YouTube channel that does, say, movie reviews or a Twitch streamer from their apartment?", "When was anything about taxes mentioned here? I\u2019m strictly talking about the concept of a judge evicting a tenant for doing essentially anything independent in a residence that would bring them any kind of money.", "Do people making money from OF report that income?", "I'm laughing so hard xD Kids do he weirdest things especially around the time puberty hits", "It's a possibility considering how much streamers get swatted. If your house gets swatted or messed up in a raid the police don't pay for it and rarely does insurance cover it.", "I'm glad I was able to make you laugh and yes, kids do some funny ass shit around puberty."]}
