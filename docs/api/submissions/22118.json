My first language is not English so there may be mistakes.** \n\nLia contacted me about a year before she got married and asked if any dates would **NOT** work - I said that it would be best to avoid the end of the month (May) that I will get my thesis written in because I had to go in-person to see my supervisor to get that all sorted, there were a bunch of in-person admin stuff as well, and I would have to rearrange a lot of my tutoring work that I was doing for my students as it would be their exam time then. My submission dates were all in that week, and so it wouldn't work.\n\nWell Lia goes ahead and books for not only the end of May, but also a holiday in a rural part of the country my family lives in, meaning that I would have to travel an extra 2-3 days on top of the wedding which would be about a week total, the entire week of my deadlines. This was with short notice as well (only three months before the wedding). Other family members couldn't make it for, as holidays in my country are not great for travelling and accommodation is really hard to find. \n\nWe have never been close and I was not part of the wedding party either (which I expected - Lia has never included me in any major event in her life). I talked to Lia and said that it would not be possible as I now had job interviews lined up (as I'd not heard much confirmation about her planned dates), my students were mid-way through their exam preparation, and my thesis was requiring more in-person events than I expected and now would be difficult to change everything. I did point out that this date was probably the worst possible one for me as I'd said before, apologised profusely, and said next time I'm in the country we could go for drinks and celebrate together if Lia would like that. \n\nLia's response was that I am a terrible sister and my whole family is now holding a grudge against me even though I did say a year in advance that that exact week would be the worst for me.

Do you have any proof of the conversation you had with her about which dates wouldn't work for you to show to your family? It's fucked that they would pressure you like this, your thesis is important! Far more important than a wedding imo", "NTA at all and you're a star for not letting your students down. Don't let your family get in your head. Be well.", "NTA\n\nLia is a manipulative person, you did tell her about the days you were busy yet she decided to choose those dates. These types of people are narcissistic and you should completely avoid her in future.", "NTA.\nSeems like your sister set you up to be the bad guy.", "NTA but your sister sure is. Just ignore your family\u2019s attitude, they will get over it eventually.", "NTA", "NTA. I think she did know It the problems It gonna cause for you. \nTell them all, they you said in advance what times Will not be available for you. \nIts not your problem that your sister choose that exact time and you dont know why she ask you in advance if she choose later that exact date. \nEvery person Who said its your fault or you need to doit something, you can block him or ignore witouth any remorse.", "NTA\n\nYou were upfront with her about that week not being good for you and explained the very good reason for it.\n\nShe is perfectly in her rights to book her wedding whenever she likes but has to appreciate that not everyone is in a position to be able to attend.", "INFO: did she give you a reason why she chose that particular week/month after you told her that it was the time you told her you couldn't make it?.  Maybe she did it to accomodate someone from her fianc\u00e9s side of the family. Or maybe she gave everybody a plausible reason to why she have to get married on may and not other time of the year.", "I see both sides. On the one hand, you were honest about your timing and I respect holding to that as you have schoolwork to do. On the other, it's hard to find dates that work for everyone and they can't just plan around you. \n\nI think this is a \"if you really wanted to, you would\" situation. It's not just a regular family dinner, it's your sister's wedding, which ideally is a once in a lifetime thing. Being a long-time grad schooler myself, it's also something that, if given enough notice, schools and professors are able to accommodate. I get that it's inconvenient, but sometimes we do inconvenient things for people we care about. Which brings me to my next point. \n\nPeople often come here asking if they were the AH for holding tight to their scheduling when it comes to family weddings. I often find that this has nothing to do with scheduling and everything to do with you not wanting to go. You clearly don't hold love for this sister, and it's clearly not important to you to go. If it was, you would be going. What you're looking for here is an excuse why it would be understandable and okay for you to not go. I don't think you're going to find that here. I think you're going to find that people land on both sides of the AH aisle. So, the question comes down to - are you okay with ruining your relationship with this sister over this scheduling conflict? Because if you are okay with always having that rift be there (she surely will not forget this), then by all means, don't go. If you have hope of a relationship with this sister, I would be making some different plans. It's up to you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

And she booked during that window.   \n\nSorry your relationship with your sister is stinky.", "NTA. A different country means you have a perfectly good reason to not go, regardless of all that other drama.", "NTA\n\nNext time your sister is planning an event, that you want to attend, and she asks you which dates wouldn't work for you, be sure to tell her the most convenient dates for you.", "NTA, why call and ask what dates would be a no go if she's then going to book the dates you definitely can't attend lol", "Lia totally did this on purpose. Your career is more important than all this petty BS. NTA", "NTA.  Sounds like she deliberately set you up for failure.  You made the right decision.", "NTA she asked what dates would not work for you, then scheduled for those dates.", "NTA for not going if you can't make it, but the timing of her wedding doesn't revolve around you.  Maybe the date the worse for you was the best for her and the groom.", "NTA.\n\nThere's always going to be someone who can't make it.  People write down dates for people they absolutely wouldn't want to get married without (usually the Parents, Grandparents, wedding party members, any siblings not in the party and possibly direct Aunts and Uncles).  But why bother if you're going to ignore the days/weeks they told you to stay clear of?\n\nWas that the only time she could get due to there still being Covid backlog?

I sort of see the point in the first comment but I also don't really agree - if I tell someone a date doesn't work, and they book it, is that really an excuse on my end? I am not sure... \n\nAlso my university is usually pretty lenient but they require an advance of more than the time I had. The problem is not so much with supervisors, but the actuall internal administration of the university. They just told me no it's too short notice to change the deadline (and would not be fair for other students).", "If Lia didn\u2019t know the *exact* worst time to schedule her wedding, how would she have been able to either massively inconvenience OP or make herself the victim if OP refused to come?", "That\u2019s because she didn\u2019t want you there and is playing the victim for your family so they don\u2019t admonish her for excluding you. \n\nBy scheduling it when you couldn\u2019t come and waiting to set the date she forced you to be the bad guy by declining the invite yourself. \n\nShow your family the evidence of her actions and forget about her. \n\nNTA", "I'm glad I wasn't the only one thinking this.
