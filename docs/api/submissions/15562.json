It's something teens can go to without their parents permission and without needing insurance if we're dealing with some stuff. I decided to do this over the traditional route because I was afraid of what my parents response would be to my reason for needing therapy.\n\nMy mom was married before my dad and divorced when she met him. She has three kids who were young at the time of the divorce and remarry. But their dad was a pretty nasty POS from what I have learned. Very controlling and jealous and possessive and he didn't like that mom moved on from him and used their kids against my parents. Mom was given primary custody and he had supervised for a couple of years and then he died. My half siblings were between like 7 and 10 when this happened. I was a small baby when this happened. Growing up I was always told they were not my half siblings, they were my siblings and I was told by my parents that they love me and that it might not be the same for a little while because they were older but once I was old enough to bond with them over stuff, we'd be super close.\n\nI never did get that super close feeling with them. They weren't mean but they were very distant with me. They didn't include me in sibling stuff they did together. I wasn't included in their weddings. You get the picture. For the most part it upset me but I was fine and then my half brother named his kids after my half sister's and then he had a third child and didn't use my name. My oldest half sister used my other half sibling's initials for all her kids and not mine. I remember seeing comments where my half brother would respond to questions on random posts about who you named your kids after and he'd say he named them after his siblings until he ran out of them. My half sister would respond to similar posts that she just used her siblings initials for all her kids. And it upset me a lot to see them say things like my siblings/all my siblings when it only included the full siblings. I realized at that point I was struggling to cope with that and that it sucked to not get that closeness my parents promised we'd have, especially when I have tried and I have asked if we could do lunch together or invited them to meet up over stuff and they never have the time, even before kids. I was worried my parents, especially mom, would try to force it on them. But I don't want a relationship through force. If they don't feel that way about me then I need to figure it out on my own.\n\nMy going to therapy was found out by an aunt recently (she saw me go into the building during the therapy hours) and told the family and everyone questioned me about the why. My parents told me I should have gone to them, etc. And my extended family were all like what do you need therapy for. I told them I didn't need to justify why and that all they needed to know is it is helping.

It's sad that you have not been able to go to someone in your family to talk about this, but I am happy you are getting therapy for this and that it is helping you.\n\nYou cannot force relationships, unfortunately and perhaps it was also the age gap that meant that you were not close with your half siblings as they were with each other.\n\nWhile your mom and dad may need to understand why you are going for therapy, your extended family does not. It is none of their business and you are not the AH for saying as much.", "NTA, okay, you are right that you do not have to justify it to them, an easier way to tell them is that you are not ready to talk to them about the reason yet.

You don\u2019t have to justify going to therapy to anyone.

Your parents were wrong to make promises about your siblings affections.  Neither you nor your half siblings are wrong. But your parents are massive assholes.  Keep going to therapy.  I am sorry you have to deal with all this", "I think you handled that with great maturity. I also think it was a great idea for you to keep quiet about the reasons, your aunt is a blabbermouth and you know if you explained it to her she'd tell everyone and it would cause an issue.

I hope you continue to find it helpful.", "I think maybe when I'm in college and not living there it will be easier. Because I feel like it will be harder to force a relationship than when I'm living under their roof kinda thing.", "Yes, it's the gradual build up of things until something more major happens and then you realize and when it happens more than once, it can be a crushing blow. I do feel like an only child sometimes and I have wished so often for a sibling.\n\nLike I remember when I was bullied when I was 11 and my teacher made a comment that my youngest half sister was bullied too and how my other half siblings would show up at her school just to tell her they were there and they'd make a point of walking her to school and home from school and how amazing they were. I remember being so sad that they knew (from mom) that I was bullied but not once did they check on me or anything. Like they couldn't do the stuff they did for her. But the lack of concern was just so hard for me to make peace with. I longed for them to show up and ask how I was doing.", "Thank you.", "That\u2019s a good point.", "NTA  You are a minor and I get why they're concerned.   But I totally understand why you're not comfortable sharing why with them.  You don't want your siblings to resent you.  I'm glad you're getting the help you need to cope with it.\n\nGood luck.", "NTA", "NTA well done for recognising your need for professional support keep focusing on your mental health", "NTA.  It's none of their business and this is why this service is available in this way.  Your aunt might be a piece of work though, because she should have had the good grace not to bring it up.\n\nI'm sorry things aren't going so good for you but you're going the right way about fixing it.", "NTA at all. In the event that ANYONE (now and for the rest of your life) ever asks why you\u2019re in therapy or what issues you\u2019re discussing, the standard answer (actually, there shouldn\u2019t be the need for an answer because these questions should never be asked) will suffice: \u201cDue to doctor/patient confidentiality, I\u2019m not at liberty to discuss it; indeed, I am ethically forbidden to breach that agreement.\u201d\n\nDoes that sound overly stuffy, pedantic, and rigid? Of course it does! That\u2019s the point. Anyone who hasn\u2019t lived under a rock for the past 50 years knows full well that there are certain situations in life that require the participants to keep quiet and maintain strict confidentiality. Maybe give this angle a try if they keep hammering away on you.\n\nGood luck getting out of there and being on your own.", "I see what you\u2019re saying, but that\u2019s not entirely true. The ethical/legal restriction applies only to the Doctor/therapist. The patient can talk to whomever they want, whenever they want. The key here is when the PATIENT wants, and only when they want.", "OP\u2019s parents may not be aware of that. I\u2019m just suggesting that if she goes all \u2018Clinical\u2019 in her delivery, she can either make them back off, or cause them to question their need to pry into her psyche. Sometimes it\u2019s easy to divert pushy people with legalese, Lol. Either way, my heart hurts for this OP. \u2639\ufe0f", "Yeah, mine too. I\u2019d probably say something more like \u2018My Doctor believes that I shouldn\u2019t be talking about this right now at this point in my therapy. I\u2019m trying to get better, so I\u2019m doing what the Dr. says.\u2019", "Yep, that\u2019s the better approach \ud83d\udc4d", "NTA, in fact it is your extended family who are being rude.", "NTA a normal response to hearing someone is in therapy and doesn't want to discuss it isn't 'your rude'. It's something along the lines of 'I hope that it's helpful to you 'and perhaps if your close' I can always make time if you need a chat or if I can help, please reach out to me if you want/need anything i can help with'.", "Blanket statement : Because of things in my life. l am not ready to talk about it.", "Or tell them that you are learning the skills needed to cope with a family that wont respect bonderies.", "Yes what a busybody!!! Why does every family seem to have one poking their nose where it doesn\u2019t belong?"]}
