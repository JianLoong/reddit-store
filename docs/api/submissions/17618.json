Art is so incredibly personal. There is a piece of you in everything you create. Art captures your mood, and feelings, at that given moment. You can convey a gloomy melancholy type day. You can show a silly jumping in the clouds type of happiness. If you\u2019re drawing people, you can capture a piece of their soul. Art is too personal. I grew up with artists and have seen, first hand, how much each piece means to them. Each and every piece holds a special meaning. What your \u201cfriend\u201d did was incredibly sneaky, low, and underhanded.\n\nThe school should\u2019ve suspended her for plagiarism. Complete with a note on her permanent record. They should give you, the actual winner, a $200 gift card, and she should have to pay the school back.

She shouldn't be bitchin' & moaning about shit. You claimed your rightful piece. The fact she *wouldn't even split* the money with you on a piece ***YOU*** did, is so damn shitty.   \n\n\nIf she's taking credit for other people's stuff, she deserves to be suspended from events.

Then entered into a contest, won, and decided it was right for her to keep the money since *checks notes* you made it and she . . . just handed it to a judge and said \"I made this.\"\n\nIt's not snitching to tell people in authority \"she stole from me and I want credit for my own work.\"", "NTA.

You called out a liar and manipulator. I'm glad you have friends support too", "NTA.\n\nShe stole your art. She's a thief. If her mum insisted she submit it she should have done so under your name (even better with your consent obviously) or tell her mum she can't because you draw it. Or at the very least agree to split the money to make up for her mean behaviour.\n\nYou reported a thief, nothing wrong with that. Actually you did the right thing. Stealing of you isn't cool and it's her poor decision making that brought it on, not you reporting her.", "Walk away like a boss while your anthem plays because you handled that well.", "That's the sad thing about this; it could have been an amazing feel-good story of OP getting the award because her friend entered the card with appropriate credit.

I'm pretty sure this is the normal rule or you could comission something to an artist and keep the difference.", "if it's \"only\" $200, why didn't she give the prize to you when you first confronted her about stealing your work to enter into the competition?", "If she had bought a card from Hallmark it would belong to her, but she would have known not to submit it as her own.", "Calling her friend a snitch is pretty much admitting she was in the wrong\u2026 and $200, $5, or $10,000; the quantity doesn\u2019t change the base fact that she\u2019s a pretty lousy friend.", "Right and she\u2019s lucky it\u2019s only a $200 gift card to learn this lesson. Instead of a $5,000+ loss when she plagiarizes in college and gets expelled.", "I agree that going to art school may be a good choice. Based on the skill of some of my daughter's fellow students in college, it isn't even necessary to be super talented at drawing to be admitted to art school. The biggest question to ask yourself is, \"if my hobby became my job, would I still enjoy doing it?\" \n\nAlso, learn now to deal effectively with people stealing your work (as you did), or asking you to do your work for free (or for exposure) because you are friends/family. If you wrote an essay or a poem and she submitted it to a contest, she would be just as much a thief. NTA", "Oh, agreed. The comment you replied to was mainly because 1, $200 for teens can be *a lot*, and 2, $200 of art supplies can go a long way at any age in terms of high quality tools.", "You need to escalate this, get the $200 and have the awards committee adjust to your name. Winning that (and having record of it) is something you can put on college applications and in a future portfolio. \n\nAlso, start writing down your experience, your feelings, etc. as this experience, and especially how you decide to handle it, is great college essay fodder"]}
