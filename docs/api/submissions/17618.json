I find it hard to believe that she did not know when she asked you to make the card.  Firstly, who asks someone else to make a mother's day card for their mother? Secondly, she could have submitted the card under your name and at least given you the artistic credit.  You gave her the chance to gracefully accept responsibility for lying to you, but she chose to keep lying", "Definitely NTA. Your friends greed placed her in the position she landed in. You did your friend a favor for Mother's Day, she then in turn submitted your work as her own, didn't say anything to you then told you she wasn't going to split the prize money...sounds like Karma. & I hope you stopped being her friend bc she put her character on full display and it's not pretty.", "NTA, Idk it what world you're an asshole for not wanting your own artistic work plagiarized, especially if shes not even willing to split the money.", "NTA entering the card in the competition isn't the issue, it's the fact that she entered it under her own name and then took it a step further by actually trying to keep the gift card for herself.

Not your circus, not your problem.", "If its only $200 then she should return it and shaddup about it. What she doesn't like about her life now is that *everyone* knows she's a liar and a thief.

You are not a snitch but you did the right thing calling out someone who is taking credit off your work and passing off your work as yours with the intention of winning the prize without her own hardwork is plain unacceptable. It shows she has no work ethic and I am sure she has done it to others before you.
