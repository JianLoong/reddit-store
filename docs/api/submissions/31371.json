They most certainly need to respect that. \n\nId also recommend maybe dont be so \u201cfinal\u201d with what you say, like telling her you will never see her as anything more than your dad\u2019s wife. Maybe that\u2019s true and totally fine if it is but it likely didnt help the conversation.", "Damn, the women really cant (or wont) take the hints. \n\nYou have every right to feel that way and put boundaries with her. \n\nShe is forcing it sooooo much. Any kind of relationship you two could have, doesnt seem possible anymore.\n\n>She told me she had signed up for the role of my parent\n\nNop. She cant do that withou your consent. She only signed up for the wife role. Period. \n\nKeep up with your boundaries. \n\n>She really didn't like any of what I had to say and she started to yell at me and repeated all the stuff I said. Now she keeps glaring at me.\n\nWell, any good intentions she may had, went trought the window. Its sad you cant even count with your father to talk to her about this. \n\nNTA.", "NTA.  Your dad seems only concerned about his relationship with his wife.  Sorry.  Try to get along so he will pay for your college.  Frankly, she needs therapy.", "NTA You father's wife is pushing too hard to be something you do not want or need. No one will ever replace your mother. Instead of letting your relationship develop at your pace within your comfort zone, she jumped in head first and disregarded your feelings. You are honest and respectful to your father and his wife. As far as you are concerned, she's your father's wife not a parent. No stepparent should try to force a relationship with their partners's children that makes them uncomfortable.", "NTA. She's overstepping. You explained her the situation perfectly well, and instead of accepting or asking how she could start gaining your trust - she started being hostile. She's not mature enough to be a step parent. You seem more mature and self-conscious than she is. \n\nIt's sad that your father did not stop her and did not take your side.", "NTA\n\nThis is really your Dads fault he should have spoken to her and told her to back off after you spoke to your Dad about it.\n\nShe made a lot of assumptions about her role in your life, and was not prepared to hear that you don't see her as anything other than tour Dad's wife, not that you hadn't kept telling her.\n\nShe will get over it. Maybe she will have a child of her own she can parent one day.\n\nIn a couple of years you can leave and live your life, go to Uni or get a job and leave them together", "nta she's definitely crossing boundaries and it's understandable that you're uncomfortable with her trying to replace your mom. your feelings are valid.", "NTA and if indeed you communicated with her what you've typed here, I'm actually quite impressed.  \n\n\nFor a 16 year old to have the emotional intelligence to tell a full grown adult woman that what she is doing is intrusive and not acceptable is exactly right.  \n\n\nIts so selfish for someone to try to \"replace\" someone that you've lost... especially a figure like your mother. It's a bit surprising to me that your father isn't having more of a say in what is going on. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI certainly don't have a \"Fix\" for you, but just keep communicating and sharing how you feel. You're not wrong for not wanting a stand in mother and its really rude for her to assume she can just step into that role.", "NTA\n\n>mom and son dates\n\nShe really said that? Tell her you are no Oedipus for her to play Jocasta.", "NTA. She has overstepped in so many ways. At your age, you are not going to adopt a new mum and she is frankly not too wise for having thought that. And what the heck does she mean by having signed up to be your new mum? Does that mean that your dad is in on this hairbrained scheme? The very best Shana can hope for, is to be a trusted adult for you. But there is not much hope for that with the way she is carrying on. It is good that your teachers and your therapist are aware of the boundaries that they have to keep up. They should not discuss *anything* with her, as she is not and will not be your parent. I am really sorry you have to go through this, and it is very sad that you father has not had it in him to show Shana her rightful place in the family.", "Your Dad has no interest in helping you? Then the problem you have is with your Dad. Tell Shana to talk to your Dad because he must signed her up to be your mom. You didn\u2019t have anything to do with that. \n\nNTA", "NTA. How old is Shana? How can any fully grown adult be this clueless?\n\n>has also tried to make us go on **\"mom and son dates\"** and would call them that. When I asked her not to she would tell me we were working on being mom and son and should start off as we want to end up.\n\nEwwww. And to think you told her you didn't like it and she just kept pushing. Ewwwww!\n\nShame on your father for not intervening on your behalf.", "NTA. This post doesn't say how long ago you met her but I'm assuming you don't know each other super well if they've only been married for under 6 months at this point, and she hasn't been in your life since you were a young child. \n\nI'm willing to assume she has positive intentions, but she is being inconsiderate, demanding, and unreasonable, which pushes her into AH territory for me. The mother-son 'dates' seem especially ick to me. Your dad is an AH here too because it's not ok for him to just shut down on this topic. He may be the biggest AH in the mix here to be honest because he is failing in his duties as a parent to not be facilitating this, helping to direct her actions, and supporting you.\n\nIdeally, obviously, you would grow to have a warm and loving relationship with her that may gradually become parent-like in nature, but you are not TA for having that relationship right now, or maybe ever. I encourage you to talk to your dad again. It may go more smoothly if you show some level of receptiveness to forming a bond with her, but you do need help and support to have your boundaries respected, and that's not happening right now.", "NTA\n\nPeople dating single parents need to understand that the child(ren) may or may not want to establish a parent-child relationship. And, most importantly, 16 is too late for the kind of parent-child relationship she wants, if any. Maybe something vaguely like one in some future date, maybe not.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I told her she cannot come in and act like I'm supposed to love and trust her just like that. She really didn't like any of what I had to say and she started to yell at me and repeated all the stuff I said. Now she keeps glaring at me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know someone like that; tries to be all sweet when trying to get something they want and when the answer is no, show themselves.", "NTA.", "NAH - I don't think her behavior is AH-level (yet?) but if she continues to push it that can change too.", "NTA. Everything you said to her was valid and I'm glad you were able to tell her. She's forcing a relationship that should be allowed to grow on its own and should be driven by the child, not the adult. And I HATE step parents that come in and do this especially when the other parent has died. How do so many people in the world have no empathy or common sense? It makes me fume.\n\nI'm sorry OP. I'm glad you are in therapy and at least getting help that way.", "NTA. This is a rough situation, but you aren't a child, you are a teenager and almost an adult. it isn't helping the situation that your dad's new wife is trying to force your relationship as opposed to letting it develop naturally. She is acting on a need that she has as opposed to actually thinking about what you might want or need, and, as a result, she is actually pushing you away. \n\nThe more appropriate way for her to develop this relationship would be for her to *ask* you what she could do to help you or to get to know you, then wait until you are ready, let you proceed at your own pace. After all, it is only a few years before you graduate and move on to the next stage of your life - she isn't going to develop the kind of relationship with you as if she had come into your life when you were a child, and she needs to understand this. \n\nIt also doesn't help that she is trying to step in and do the exact same things that you used to do with your mother (and openly say that she is going to make them better) - that is a recipe for alienation, and it tells you that she wants to erase your mother's presence in your life and replace it with her.", "I don't know how long exactly they were dating. I met her about 16 months ago.", "Agreed NTA.  \n\nYour dad's reaction is even more off-putting than your Shana's.  I don't know what its like to have one's wife (or mom) pass, so I don't want to discount his own pain in this, but to be so utterly clueless about your feelings in this matter, to be so out of sync to have to literally be told by you that she's not going to be any sort of parent to you, and then \"shut down\" as you say and give you no support.   I m baffled by such a reaction.  \n\nBut back to Shana, I can understand her trying, it even makes sense and normal to try and build some sort of relationship with you.   She should be doing that.   But to come out with \"signing up as a parent\",  WOW.  Very much an overstep and into  dysfunctional behavior-land, to say nothing of a gross amount of disrespect to your late mom.   she is just over the top here.  Way over the top.  \"Mom and son dates\" just sounds so gross.  Cringe in the extreme  \n\nDunno everyone's ages, but I really hope that they don't have their own kids.  That will likely change this dynamic in a very negative way.", "My dad wants to keep his wife happy and maybe wants to act like we're just a typical nuclear family again. Maybe he also just wants things to be easy. What I do know is he won't have my back in any of this.", "I think she's about 40.", "Spoiler alert: Shana\u2019s 17.", "Once OP communicated that he thought her behavior was intrusive and not appropriate and they didnt back off, Dad and Stepmom became AHs.", "It sounds to me like she\u2019s making a genuine effort. Now the effort is not desired. So I don\u2019t think anyone is really the asshole. \n\nI think she wants OP to have the benefits of a two parent household and support system. Other than the mom-son date thing, I don\u2019t really see anything too outrageous for a step parent to be doing.", "You just need to make it clear you're happy she cares and happy she wants to be in your life but you only had one Mother and that unfortunately she's gone. \n\nTell her you'd like to start developing a relationship slowly and that it doesn't need to be one of mother to son, and see how it goes.", "She acts like she's 12.\n\nYou're a 16yo boy who has a 40yo woman glaring at him because she came on WAY too strong and you tried to establish some boundaries?\n\nHave another talk with your dad. HE is the one who should be explaining all this to her.\n\nIn this particular situation you could not be less of an AH.", "> So I don\u2019t think anyone is really the asshole. \n\nThat's what NAH means...?"]}
