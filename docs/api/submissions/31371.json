Maybe that\u2019s true and totally fine if it is but it likely didnt help the conversation.", "Damn, the women really cant (or wont) take the hints. \n\nYou have every right to feel that way and put boundaries with her. \n\nShe is forcing it sooooo much. Any kind of relationship you two could have, doesnt seem possible anymore.\n\n>She told me she had signed up for the role of my parent\n\nNop. She cant do that withou your consent. She only signed up for the wife role. Period. \n\nKeep up with your boundaries. \n\n>She really didn't like any of what I had to say and she started to yell at me and repeated all the stuff I said.

Your dad seems only concerned about his relationship with his wife.  Sorry.  Try to get along so he will pay for your college.  Frankly, she needs therapy.", "NTA You father's wife is pushing too hard to be something you do not want or need. No one will ever replace your mother. Instead of letting your relationship develop at your pace within your comfort zone, she jumped in head first and disregarded your feelings. You are honest and respectful to your father and his wife. As far as you are concerned, she's your father's wife not a parent. No stepparent should try to force a relationship with their partners's children that makes them uncomfortable.", "NTA. She's overstepping. You explained her the situation perfectly well, and instead of accepting or asking how she could start gaining your trust - she started being hostile. She's not mature enough to be a step parent. You seem more mature and self-conscious than she is. \n\nIt's sad that your father did not stop her and did not take your side.", "NTA\n\nThis is really your Dads fault he should have spoken to her and told her to back off after you spoke to your Dad about it.\n\nShe made a lot of assumptions about her role in your life, and was not prepared to hear that you don't see her as anything other than tour Dad's wife, not that you hadn't kept telling her.\n\nShe will get over it. Maybe she will have a child of her own she can parent one day.\n\nIn a couple of years you can leave and live your life, go to Uni or get a job and leave them together", "nta she's definitely crossing boundaries and it's understandable that you're uncomfortable with her trying to replace your mom. your feelings are valid.", "NTA and if indeed you communicated with her what you've typed here, I'm actually quite impressed.  \n\n\nFor a 16 year old to have the emotional intelligence to tell a full grown adult woman that what she is doing is intrusive and not acceptable is exactly right.  \n\n\nIts so selfish for someone to try to \"replace\" someone that you've lost... especially a figure like your mother. It's a bit surprising to me that your father isn't having more of a say in what is going on. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI certainly don't have a \"Fix\" for you, but just keep communicating and sharing how you feel. You're not wrong for not wanting a stand in mother and its really rude for her to assume she can just step into that role.", "NTA\n\n>mom and son dates\n\nShe really said that? Tell her you are no Oedipus for her to play Jocasta.", "NTA. She has overstepped in so many ways. At your age, you are not going to adopt a new mum and she is frankly not too wise for having thought that. And what the heck does she mean by having signed up to be your new mum? Does that mean that your dad is in on this hairbrained scheme? The very best Shana can hope for, is to be a trusted adult for you. But there is not much hope for that with the way she is carrying on. It is good that your teachers and your therapist are aware of the boundaries that they have to keep up. They should not discuss *anything* with her, as she is not and will not be your parent. I am really sorry you have to go through this, and it is very sad that you father has not had it in him to show Shana her rightful place in the family.", "Your Dad has no interest in helping you? Then the problem you have is with your Dad. Tell Shana to talk to your Dad because he must signed her up to be your mom. You didn\u2019t have anything to do with that. \n\nNTA", "NTA. How old is Shana? How can any fully grown adult be this clueless?\n\n>has also tried to make us go on **\"mom and son dates\"** and would call them that. When I asked her not to she would tell me we were working on being mom and son and should start off as we want to end up.\n\nEwwww. And to think you told her you didn't like it and she just kept pushing. Ewwwww!\n\nShame on your father for not intervening on your behalf.", "NTA. This post doesn't say how long ago you met her but I'm assuming you don't know each other super well if they've only been married for under 6 months at this point, and she hasn't been in your life since you were a young child. \n\nI'm willing to assume she has positive intentions, but she is being inconsiderate, demanding, and unreasonable, which pushes her into AH territory for me. The mother-son 'dates' seem especially ick to me. Your dad is an AH here too because it's not ok for him to just shut down on this topic. He may be the biggest AH in the mix here to be honest because he is failing in his duties as a parent to not be facilitating this, helping to direct her actions, and supporting you.\n\nIdeally, obviously, you would grow to have a warm and loving relationship with her that may gradually become parent-like in nature, but you are not TA for having that relationship right now, or maybe ever. I encourage you to talk to your dad again. It may go more smoothly if you show some level of receptiveness to forming a bond with her, but you do need help and support to have your boundaries respected, and that's not happening right now.", "NTA\n\nPeople dating single parents need to understand that the child(ren) may or may not want to establish a parent-child relationship. And, most importantly, 16 is too late for the kind of parent-child relationship she wants, if any. Maybe something vaguely like one in some future date, maybe not.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I told her she cannot come in and act like I'm supposed to love and trust her just like that.

Everything you said to her was valid and I'm glad you were able to tell her. She's forcing a relationship that should be allowed to grow on its own and should be driven by the child, not the adult. And I HATE step parents that come in and do this especially when the other parent has died. How do so many people in the world have no empathy or common sense? It makes me fume.\n\nI'm sorry OP. I'm glad you are in therapy and at least getting help that way.", "NTA. This is a rough situation, but you aren't a child, you are a teenager and almost an adult. it isn't helping the situation that your dad's new wife is trying to force your relationship as opposed to letting it develop naturally. She is acting on a need that she has as opposed to actually thinking about what you might want or need, and, as a result, she is actually pushing you away. \n\nThe more appropriate way for her to develop this relationship would be for her to *ask* you what she could do to help you or to get to know you, then wait until you are ready, let you proceed at your own pace. After all, it is only a few years before you graduate and move on to the next stage of your life - she isn't going to develop the kind of relationship with you as if she had come into your life when you were a child, and she needs to understand this. \n\nIt also doesn't help that she is trying to step in and do the exact same things that you used to do with your mother (and openly say that she is going to make them better) - that is a recipe for alienation, and it tells you that she wants to erase your mother's presence in your life and replace it with her.", "I don't know how long exactly they were dating. I met her about 16 months ago.", "Agreed NTA.\n\nYour dad's reaction is even more off-putting than  Shana's.  I don't know what its like to have one's wife (or mom) pass, so I don't want to discount his own pain in this, but to be so utterly clueless about your feelings in this matter, to be so out of sync to have to literally be told by you that she's not going to be any sort of parent to you, and then \"shut down\" as you say and give you no support.   I m baffled by such a reaction.\n\nBut back to Shana, I can understand her trying, it even makes sense and normal to try and build some sort of relationship with you.   She should be doing that.   But to come out with \"signing up as a parent\",  WOW.  Very much an overstep and into  dysfunctional behavior-land, to say nothing of a gross amount of disrespect to your late mom.   she is just over the top here.  Way over the top.  \"Mom and son dates\" just sounds so gross.  Cringe in the extreme\n\nDunno everyone's ages, but I really hope that they don't have their own kids.  That will likely change this dynamic in a very negative way.", "My dad wants to keep his wife happy and maybe wants to act like we're just a typical nuclear family again. Maybe he also just wants things to be easy. What I do know is he won't have my back in any of this.", "I think she's about 40.", "Spoiler alert: Shana\u2019s 17.", "Once OP communicated that he thought her behavior was intrusive and not appropriate and they didnt back off, Dad and Stepmom became AHs.", "It sounds to me like she\u2019s making a genuine effort. Now the effort is not desired. So I don\u2019t think anyone is really the asshole. \n\nI think she wants OP to have the benefits of a two parent household and support system. Other than the mom-son date thing, I don\u2019t really see anything too outrageous for a step parent to be doing.", "You just need to make it clear you're happy she cares and happy she wants to be in your life but you only had one Mother and that unfortunately she's gone. \n\nTell her you'd like to start developing a relationship slowly and that it doesn't need to be one of mother to son, and see how it goes.", "She acts like she's 12.\n\nYou're a 16yo boy who has a 40yo woman glaring at him because she came on WAY too strong and you tried to establish some boundaries?\n\nHave another talk with your dad. HE is the one who should be explaining all this to her.\n\nIn this particular situation you could not be less of an AH.", "> So I don\u2019t think anyone is really the asshole. \n\nThat's what NAH means...?", "NTA. You are very insightful and mature. The Shana is trying to literally bulldoze their way into your life.\n\nThe level of her insensitivity is incredible, even strangers rebuffed her inappropriate insertion of herself into your life. You have handled this situation with a lot of grace and I hope your dad and the Shana listen to you and your therapist and respect your feelings.", "Here's some \"food for thought\" for her. She asked you a direct question and when you told her that sh cannot come in and expect you to \"love and trust her just like that\" her response was to get angry and yell at you, and now she's continuing to show her anger. That rather proves that you were right not to trust her - her actions have proven that she wants to take on a role without earning her place in it. She might have been able to open a door with you if she were willing to take it slow, not overstep (been willing to back down when told she's overstepping), and build a relationship with you FIRST as your Dad's Wife before having expectations of anything more. - Ask her what you are supposed to do now that she's failed at the most simple task of proving that she has the potential to be more than just your Dad's Wife by screaming at you when you gave her an honest answer to her question instead of taking a step back and figuring out how to build a relationship with your from where YOU ARE rather than where SHE WANTS to be?\n\nNTA - put this punctured ball firmly back in her court. She's the adult. It's wrong of her to make this about her and what she wants.", "Oh honey.  NTA.  I have a son your age and I just want to give you a hug.  That\u2019s a rough situation.  You get no say in it yet you have to deal with living with this person you did not choose.  It sucks and it\u2019s unfair.  Relationships build naturally over time.  She did not raise you.  It\u2019s normal you don\u2019t feel like she\u2019s your mother.  She\u2019s not.  I feel the same way about my stepfather. He\u2019s a lovely man and I like him.  But I was an adult when he came along so I don\u2019t feel like he\u2019s a parent.  He\u2019s not.  He\u2019s my mom\u2019s husband. And that\u2019s ok.  She needs to back off.

You got this!!!", "\"She came up with this plan for us to \"better\" the stuff my mom and I used to make...\" What a horrible thing to say!  That's incredibly disrespectful to you and your mom. \n\nShe is completely out of line. Trying to insert herself into your THERAPY? Thinking that you would tell your club mates about her? Wanting to be considered an instaMom (just add water)? She is delusional. A familial bond is not something she can demand or force and every day that she refuses to respect you as a person with your own feelings, thoughts and boundaries is another day she'll never have the relationship wants. Your father gave her his name and his ring. And that's great. But he CANNOT GIVE HER YOUR LOVE OR AFFECTION. That does not belong to him, and they were both wrong to think she or anyone was entitled to it. \n\nYou are NTA. They are both failing you right now and being ridiculously selfish. You don't exist to grant her wish to be a mom or to be a gift your father can give away. That they didn\u2019t bother to work on this expectation before he got married is ridiculous.", "NTA. Good job learning from therapy. Now Jocasta needs to commit to a few years of therapy.

I have kids around your age, and some of the things she\u2019s asking I wouldn\u2019t even push on my own flesh and blood kids.  I cringed hard about the therapist thing, I wouldn\u2019t dream of trying to ask the therapist about how things are going in therapy, that\u2019s just wrong.  Having said that, I do see some room for compromise.  For example, let her give you a ride sometime.  That\u2019s an easy one, won\u2019t hurt you, and might make her feel like you\u2019re trying to meet her in the middle somewhere.  I do think you\u2019re going to have to continue to be strong in enforcing boundaries with her, some of her asks are just unreasonable (ie the therapist thing), but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a lost cause (it might be if she doesn\u2019t learn to back off on the unreasonable things) and for the most part it\u2019s going to be up to you to decide where you can meet her in the middle and where it\u2019s a hard line for you. The cooking thing, for example.  Since you did that with your mom, you might very well decide that it\u2019s a hard line and you want to keep that as something you shared with your mom. Or, you could decide to give it a try cooking with her, and if she\u2019s a good cook you might learn a lot from her.  There\u2019s no right or wrong there, just what\u2019s right for you and if you decide not to then she should respect your decision and not try to push it on you.  If she tries to push your boundaries eventually you\u2019ll break and your relationship with her will be forever ruined (and I hope she understands that).", "NTA.

You have no obligation to treat her like she's your mom and she's being incredibly intrusive and insensitive to you. Your father is also absurd. He can't just expect you to magically love some random woman you aren't related to.", "NTA\n\nSounds like your dads wife has some issues with bounderies and bonding.

Its not like you're giving a loved one the silent treatment or the cold shoulder, you're not being withholding, she tried to just elevate your relationship 5 stories upwards without your consent. You've set a healthy boundary and it's a good sign that you're able to do that at your age and despite your fathers position on the issue. This is a distinctive sign of personal indipendence and resiliance.\n\nYou are right in telling her that she is behaving intrusive and her immature reaction pretty much reflects that.", "NTA. Maybe ask your therapist if they can facilitate a conversation between you, your dad, and his wife? I think the wife means well, but she doesn't understand that what she is doing is only in *her* best interest and not yours. In other words, she is trying to make *herself* feel better without regard as to how it makes *you* feel.", "NTA and she isn't helping by being so pushy about it.

Honestly, I\u2019d just say she tried to fondle your genitals and report her to the police and turn it into a huge thing. Fuck it. Life\u2019s too short to be harassed by some woman having a midlife crisis because she never had kids of her own and is over correcting for her poor life choices. Not sarcasm, just want to introduce a little anarchy. \ud83d\ude43", "Oh sweetheart... Sorry for the familiar term but I'm a mom and just as a mom it breaks my heart to see a child hurting...you are not the asshole. Not even close. I am so sorry that you lost your mother. It's clear that you love her very much.\n\nWhile family therapy is not my particular set of expertise, let me see though if I can play a bit of \"devils advocate\" and hope you gain some understanding. This is by no means meant to make you allow your stepmother more into your life than what you're comfortable with but maybe give you some perspective as to where she is coming from. \n\nIf it applies to you and it helps you then that makes me happy however if it does not fit your situation then just ignore it and move on.\n\nIn regards to your stepmother:\n\nThe amount of pressure that society puts on people, and it doesn't matter if they are male or female, coming into a relationship with a single parent to fulfill certain roles and feel certain ways and act certain ways is absolutely overwhelming. \nThere unfortunately is no universal answers to how you're supposed to act or what roles you're supposed to take on and a lot of that is largely dependent on how old the children are and what the children want and what is dictated as needs of the relationship because of what the person who they married does and the list goes on.\nIt doesn't seem to me that your stepmother is doing this in a way where she's trying to erase the memory of your mother but more that she's trying to be a *bonus* mom. She's trying to make sure that she doesn't let you down and that she doesn't let your father down and she probably has absolutely no clue what it is she's doing (parenting wise) but like all the rest of us just trying to wing it.\nYour resistance to her presence is probably making her wonder what it is that she's doing wrong or if she's not good enough and all of those are her own insecurities. Those are in no way shape or form on you. You are absolutely entitled to your own feelings and your own boundaries.\nBut as you are coming to discover adults really don't have it anymore figured out than what kids do. We just make it up as we go along. \n\nIn regards to your father: \n\nYou didn't say much about the state of your parents relationship when your mother passed but I'm assuming that they were together because you mentioned that you feel like your father just wants a nuclear family again. That could very well be true. If they were still together your father probably felt pretty lost for a very long time because not only did he lose your mom but now he had to be solely responsible for you. Yes family members might have helped but in the end it all came down on him. Meeting your stepmother and falling in love with her probably felt to him like a breath of fresh air that he never thought he would get again. Raising kids is hard and doing it alone is even harder so I'm sure there's a part of him that felt like there was a completeness to him that he hadn't felt in a long time.\nI'm sorry he's not more supportive of you and your feelings. \n\nAll of this is really just meant to try and give you maybe an insight to their perspective. Seriously as adults we really do not have any more answers than what we did when we were your age just more examples of things going terribly wrong. \ud83d\ude09\n\nWith that, I'm not going to encourage you to allow this woman to cross your boundaries or to replace your mother because that is never what should be done. \nBut instead of just looking at this woman like your father's wife perhaps think about how you might feel in 5 years or 10 years (or whatever) about this woman who is going to be a part of your family. \nIs there a kind of relationship with her you can envision that is not defined purely by her status as your father's wife?\nWhere perhaps you're friends (or partners in crime depending upon how crazy you want to drive your father)? \n\nThat's not to say that you should feel pressure or obligated to define it now but perhaps it will help you to open your heart and your feelings. As human beings we are constantly growing and constantly evolving.\n\nThat said I would just reiterate to both of them again that you are not ready right now to have her be anything more than his wife. Not saying you might not be open to it in the future or anything but for now it's only been 5 months since they've been married and you need time and space to adjust to your new reality and they need to respect that.\n\nI wish you the best of luck hun!", "NAH.

I have a stepdad, (dad) and he\u2019s adopting me. The reason why? I asked him to.

She never showed. \n\nBut my step mom did. She showed up. Took photos. And has been there for all my life achievements. \n\nFirst school dance. Learning to shave. Driving. High school graduation.

Maybe she could help mediate a conversation about it. \n\nYou are nta. This is a tale as old as time.

Preferably someone who was close to your mom or knew her well? If what you're saying about your dad is accurate then he won't be backing you up in any way. It seems like you've already communicated enough times that she's overstepping, and that all you expect of her is to be your dad's wife. If she wants to be a \"mother\" so bad she should just have a kid. If you ever say that to her just make sure that the reason she doesn't have any isn't because of infertility or a medical condition so that she isn't able to make you out to be the asshole (even though this would be a situation where it would be warranted). If you stay with someone, she can't be a mother since there aren't any kids around. Make sure the rest of your family at least understands where your coming from and what's happening (bare bones), since you wouldn't want her to spread misinformation around and alienate them from you.

It\u2019s disturbing that she came in full force like that. Maybe try to tell her that she did way too much and way too extra so fast. The more she pushes herself on you the more you will pull away. You both need time to get to know each other and she completely skipped that. Though tbh I would just ignore her existence after her trying to better your mom\u2019s recipes. It\u2019s like she thinks she can replace your mom, sorry for your loss, but she can\u2019t. She may need therapy too.", "NTA.  Your dad's wife is being incredibly pushy & intrusive and her competition with your late mother is just gross.  You are entitled to your feelings and it is *not* your responsibility to make your dad or his wife happy and you are not obligated to participate in her \"dates\" (ick).  It sounds like you have been polite and honest when you talk to them, so her yelling and your dad's withdrawal are very inappropriate.  \n\nI'm very glad you have your aunt and grandpa for support.", "no", "NTA.

But relationships are built over time. This is what is missing. She doesn't have to be your mom but she can be an adult you can like & trust with TIME! I don't understand why the other adults in your family can't just step in and take over the role they want. You may have been a little a too harsh. But it was the truth...so maybe next time, if there is one, explain you will never be a mother but WITH TIME, she could be a trusted friend.

This is absolutely the type of thing some of my previous therapists would recommend to a new step parent. Some people could maybe respond well to this? I don't know. But obviously this isn't one of those situations and either Shana is 100% clueless and just blinding sticking to her guns or she is being persuaded by someone to continue the \"force it on you\" method.", "Reading that made my stomach jolt a bit, wtf is wrong with her??! \n\nTrying to bond with OOP through cooking was a decent enough idea but she picked the absolute most disrespectful way possible to frame it. If Nigella Lawson herself offered to give me a private cooking class then said that about my mum's recipes I'd be kicking her tf out.", "Ding ding ding.  She doesn\u2019t care about OP, this is all about the optics.

How long were they together before marrying? Since you have a therapist, ask them how to explain it to her. You're def not the A. \n\nMaybe you need to bring dad into a therapy session to get the 2 of you straight first. You're happy he's happy, but you weren't asking for a new mom, nor do you want one. And if she could step back and just treat you more like a roommate, you could maybe eventually have a cordial relationship. Not saying she'd be a mom or anywhere near that, but maybe she could be like an older sister or aunt. \n\nAs well-spoken as you were, I think you do need an adult to back you up. And it may have to be the therapist.\n\nGood luck.", "This is a really bizarre assertion.  It's absolutely within the role of a therapist to help someone realize and correct a misalignment of thought or purpose, including self-absorption or overbearing step-parenting or what have you.

You might get some help from another adult, if not your therapist then perhaps your grandpa or aunt. Shana is being inappropriate, and she needs to be told by someone to back off.
