Stay home and do your own thing", "YWBTA for throwing things out\u2026 but if you guys still decide to go, make sure to bring back up food for your SO. You don\u2019t have to make a big deal of it, but that way your SO can eat. \n\nI\u2019m vegan, and I\u2019ve been known to have back up food in my purse that I didn\u2019t need because of AWESOME hosts. I\u2019ve also been to places where there was nothing, but I got to eat.", "YWBTA. It's not that hard to make sure there are allergen free options, but wasting the food of others who had no knowledge of the allergy is over the top. The anger is justified but it becomes misdirected if it's what the others made. I like the flag idea someone else mentioned. Your mom is TA for consistently disregarding an allergy. I have friends and family with a variety of allergies and we don't even consider cooking with their allergens, the only reason I can see your mom does this is some underlying resentment toward your wife.", "You should just not go, spend a nice intimate Christmas with your SO. Watch movies, make whatever you both like to eat, drink hot chocolate, play Christmas music (if you're both fans). Do what YOU want, eat what YOU like. Your mom's the AH here, that's some seriously fucked up passive aggressive behavior on her part. Nut allergies are often deadly. NTA.", "YWBTA\n\nYou would be punishing people who don't even know about the allergy that would make YTA, and honestly, the likelihood of it accomplishing what you want it to is slim. The reasonable response is to just not attend functions there anymore, and when anyone asks why, tell them because your mother refuses to accommodate your SO's food allergy.", "I\u2019d bring takeout or something- like a whole pizza box to spread out at the dining table and explain that since no one listened; nuts are on almost everything so your SO must bring her own food so she doesn\u2019t die", "YWBTA", "Ywbta for throwing out food other people have brought especially if they aren't aware of the allergy.\n\nI would not attend as your mum is clearly doing this on purpose and doesn't want to accommodate your SO, this is a health issue not a choice, even though that should be respected, for example if someone is vegetarian/vegan.\n\n You could always just pop over for a drink to see people if close by and then leave.", "YTA! Why would you ruin good food when you can just bring food for her? I get that allergies suck but don\u2019t expect everyone to change recipes to accommodate ONE person\u2026 just bring her food from somewhere else and have her eat that.", "No one I know with a nut allergy expects a change in the menu. My SIL brings banana bread and one other dish without nuts and asks about specific dishes she and her daughter want to eat. Then we all have our meal as adults.", "As others have said, don\u2019t go.  Isn\u2019t that really the right action here?  \n\nClearly your mother doesn\u2019t care about your SO or they\u2019d have nut free dishes. If this is happening every year, why are t the other people bringing food not aware of this?  Have you not told them?\n\nThrowing out the food is a dick move. Just don\u2019t go.  That gets the point across much better, everyone gets to eat their Xmas food SAFELY.  Why you would continue to go and expose your SO to that behaviour I have no idea.", "Your options are:\n\nGo, at the risk of your SO mistakenly eating something that could kill them because \"I forgot\".\n\nThrowing absolutely everything in the bin, no holds barred, because \"I forgot\" and who knows what else she forgot to not put nuts on/in. Not worth the risk. Everything gets thrown away. \n\nDon't go, have your own safe and won't kill anyone meal at home. When you get that phone call, you say \"we forgot\". Put phone down, eat and enjoy safe meal.", "YWBTA  if you throw out the food  , your partners health is more important   , dont go   ring her and tell her  untill she starts to  keep the nuts out of the food  you wont be eating at her house anymore .  Does  she have something  against  your   SO    , because  it feels  to some extent its being done on purpose . how do you know if she  says  it has no nuts  but she put them in anyway  .", "I think it depends on the severity of her allergy. Like can she just not ingest it or can she like not be near it? Also, you DEFINITELY should have told the other people.", "NTA why are you going every year ?", "YTA for going to your mom\u2019s for Christmas knowing there will be nuts in the food and nothing for your SO to eat. Tell your mother you are not coming this year because she will not take nuts off the menu.", "Just don't go. They have shown you they are not taking your SO seriously. Book a nice restaurant and do your own thing. NTA", "The better thing to do is not to go. And keep avoiding her until she\u2019s ready to comply. Your mother is TA", "NTA, I\u2019d document every one of these conversations so that when your mother does this again you can ask her if she\u2019d like the police called on her for attempted murder? Nut allergies are sadly no laughing matter\u2026 scary that someone can die from a peanut", "YWBTA - Throw out my food and I\u2019d throw you out. SO should come prepared since your mother obviously doesn\u2019t give af, and you can\u2019t make her. Or don\u2019t go, but it\u2019s not your home and you don\u2019t get to enforce your rules there.", "NTA, but from past actions, I assume your SO's nut allergy isn't so intense that she can't be around nuts. Like some people can't even breathe the same air where nuts are present.\n\nIn this case, you should prepare 2-3 dishes only for you and your SO and take with you. When there, make sure you reach a little late so everyone else is there as well, make an announcement. Tell your mother as she won't respect your SO's nut allergy; you've brought your own meal. Then sit down and eat your own food. It'll be a great way for everyone to find out what an AH your mother is (there's nothing worse than being put down publically). \n\nAlso, let her know that from then onwards, you will not be attending anything she hosts if your SO's needs are not met.", "YTA. Grow\nUp.", ">say \"oh I forgot\"\n\nExpand on this a bit: \"Oh, I forgot! I must be nuts!!\"", ">No don't throw it out. Just don't show up. When she calls to ask why you are not there say \"oh I forgot\"\n\nThis!!   Do this for **every** time she invites you and your SO.  She will get the message that you and your SO are a package deal and you will not tolerate the disrespect towards her.", "NTA. I'm VERY allergic to pork. There are certain members of my husband's family that \"conveniently\" forget even though we've been married almost 30 years. They send us things like bacon wrapped filets, pork chops, fancy pork hot dogs etc for Christmas. I've started sending them big candy assortments. This year I sent a Harry & David waffle breakfast basket... Basically all sugar. One is diabetic & one is pre-diabetic. They won't dare complain about their $100 gift basket. We sent it to a couple other family members so they can't accuse us of singling them out. Petty? Passive aggressive? Hell yeah. But... They've been trying to kill me with pork for decades!", "Yes, you would be TA - if you go there. So don't go there. Make her come to you if she wants to see you and make the foods you want instead of eating what she makes.", "exactly why waste food", "this is the way", "Yeah I kinda want to know this too. Maybe I\u2019m weird cause I really don\u2019t like nuts but what the heck are people cooking with so much nuts in it?\n\nI mean like obviously pecan pie. But what are all these dishes she seems to find to add nuts to? Nuts on top of bread? I feel like she extra trying to be awful here.", "Exactly. If she has an allergy and it keeps being ignored then stop going to the place that triggers her allergies. If your mother truly wants you there then she'd stop using nuts.", "It is either this or you will need to bring your own food and explain how serious a nut allergy can be. Not the same as \u201cpicky eater\u201d. It is administer injection, maybe call ambulance, trip to ER\u2026 NOT happy family dinner at all.  Good heavens what a potential nightmare!", "ESH, then, not Y T A", "Plus, I think your mom may be telling you (with her actions) that she doesn\u2019t want your SO there.  Maybe, it\u2019s time for new traditions that don\u2019t put your SO in danger.", "Oooh!  I really like this idea!  I hope OP sees it.", "Several countries use \u2018bin\u2019 for their word for trash.", "Why do you feel the need to mention your inference?\n\nI mean, good job re: bin=trash, but is the concept of other countries using different words for stuff really so foreign to you?", "I think a better fun date would be for OP and SO to go out on their own and skip Mom\u2019s house of nuts.", "No, it's not. Nut allergies can be extremely dangerous.", "Or go to SO\u2019s family whose not actively trying to kill them.", "As someone who has a nut allergy as well. YES . Do this. Sooner or later she will \"remeber\".", "I wish I had an award I could give you. This is the perfect response", "Nah see you got to get in on the sugar free gummy bears that make your poop your brains out. The amount of times i was tempted to send them to my diabetic uncle when he pissed me off was too high.  Disappointed i never got to act that one out.", "lol!", "Yep...she wants to see you, she can put on her big girl panties and come see you, in your house where you control the food and don't have to trust her to \"remember\" your partner's allergies.", "I liked baking a lot and I added nuts/almonds to almost everything because of they are a tasty crunch. Also salads? And toasted peanuts to salsa? Possibly pasta? That sounds nice.", "I think Almonds are in alot of foods around the holidays!!", "No, bring your own food and loudly announce, when questioned, that despite knowing your SO for years, your mother continually \"forgets\" about his nut allergy. You have no idea why she wants to kill your SO, but the choice was not to est her cooking or spend Christmas in the ER.", "I get that, but it isn\u2019t your house.  You can\u2019t demand everywhere you go appease just you.  I know people with real bad peanut allergies that prepare and bring their own food so they don\u2019t disrupt people.  They also don\u2019t allow people to shake their hands or kiss them.  They find ways to attend events they want to attend without requesting anything.", "Or she won't, but no great loss either way,  it seems.", "She does remember already. She is choosing her actions at this point.", "I think you speak of the infamous Harribo gummy bears. OP that would be the Christmas present that keeps on giving.", "OMG I love the reviews on Amazon lmao", "I was looking for this very comment. The best part? Haribo candies have a shelf life of around two years. More than enough time to plot.", "This is the way ( NTA OP ) eat out of the microwave trays as an extra embarrassment to her too"]}
