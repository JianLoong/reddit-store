Just never go to family functions?\n\nIt doesn't matter that the rest of the people  didn't know. That's on Mum. \n\nOP your not the asshole. I had a friend who had an anaphilactic episode while I was camping with him. I was terrified and had to give his epipen to him. \n\nAnyone who discounts an allergy is an asshole and I'll start on that hill till I die", "You can\u2019t control her, but you can control your own behavior. If nuts are on the menu *don\u2019t go over* to her place. Withhold your presence. Rinse and repeat until there are no nuts.", "Literally, just don't show up. Have your own Christmas party and if anyone asks go \"my mom keeps 'forgetting' of my SOs nut allergy after years of telling her and I got tired of it. Im not risking my SOs health for a party shes not safe in.\" \n\nYWBTA for tossing things not made by your mom, she knows, others might not know", "I just wouldn't go. It is not a safe environment.  My dd has tree nut allergies. Whenever we go to our families the grandparents put all possible contaminated foods (nuts and processed with nuts) in a cupboard and those are off limit to everyone.", "Why the heck do you keep going to your mom's as she is trying to , at best, alienate your s.o., at worst kill her? You would be the AH for going again.", "If it was important to your family they would remember.  NTA but if you don\u2019t put your foot down your family will continue this way.  There is not a snowballs chance in hell I would go if my SO was treated this poorly.\n\nI have a severe allergy to cherries as in I carry an epi pen.  It took 20 years before my mom could remember that I had this allergy.  It took my boss less than 1 year to remember.", "NTA but just stop going and putting her through this. Your mum will just keep doing it", "I think the appropriate response would be \"Oh, nuts, I forgot.\"", "Exactly this. \n\nYou are under no obligation to show up if she keeps disrespecting your SO. Just start your own Xmas tradition with each other", "Yeah this is sus", "I\u2019m also curious if every dish has nuts, or just one or two?\n\nWe usually try to make everything gluten-free, but if we don\u2019t, we have a gluten section at the party. It\u2019s not that big of a deal.\n\nIf SO is able to eat most the food I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big deal to miss out on 1 or 2 items (unless SO is deathly allergic to the extent that cross-contamination would be dangerous, but that doesn\u2019t sound like the case).", "Right!? I have a severe nut allergy and its super rare that I can eat everything being offered, yet I never get offended...", "That's what I would do, too. Bring your own food. People will inevitably ask why they brought their own food, and that's when OP can explain his mother's convenient loss of memory around the SO and shared meals. Also, the petty part of me hopes neither OP nor the SO are allergic to seafood, because I would 100% bring some fried fish and some pasta that contains smoked oysters and then microwave it just as mom was serving her pecan-crusted turkey.", "Right??? Who\u2019s first thought is \u2018I\u2019m going to throw the food away\u2019???\n\nFood that cost money, that people poured time and effort into, food that will need to be replaced. When people are going hungry. Apple didn\u2019t fall far from the tree.", "Because his partner might die? \nHow is OP and his partner supposed to go throughout life now? Just never go to family functions?\n\nNow you're the asshole. And i mean that", ".... and remember to include the information on quite ***how long*** your MOTHER has known this about this allergy but how she still kept \"forgetting\" the allergy, no matter how many times you've mentioned it when she invited you both.", "Also wouldn\u2019t be surprised if mommy dearest decided to \u201ctest\u201d the allergy and use nut flour in stuff.", "Why is he the AH though?\nHe's already asked her to do that?", "Spot the murican", "My thoughts exactly. I got through hosting three holiday celebrations without a nut in sight\u2026.and I wasn\u2019t even trying to avoid them in order to not endanger someone\u2019s life.", "I don't like nuts either. They ruin a dish, imo. WHY do so many people like them? LOL.  There are so many really good cereals out there that are ruined because of almonds. You are not weird! lol", "Green beans with slivered almonds; walnuts in chocolate chip cookies,  pumpkin bread, banana bread, and/or brownies; granola crusts on fruit pies; macrons (almond flour based); peanuts in toffee or brittle. Those are just the things I've HAD at a holiday dinner that frequently has nuts in it. If anyone is gluten free it's even more likely there will be nuts.", "If it was just food MIL made and \"forgot\" it would be fine.  Throwing out food brought by other guests would make OP a huge asshole.", "Yes.  If family refuses to accept that partner has an allergy, and keeps bringing nuts; than the responsible option is to not go.  Did you not see the news story about the grandmother that snuck child cookies because she didn't believe in it?  The kid almost died!  Or the one where the grandma washed kid's hair in an allergen during an overnight to prove allergy was fake?  That kid did die.  If you want to consider me an AH, feel free.  I will gladly accept the title.  If there is a future post of my mom hid nuts in my SO's food after I repeatedly told her he was allergic and he died... would your answer still be \"whelp, what was their other option?  Not go.  That would have been rude.\"", "She clearly is saying that.", "Now that's just rubbish", "\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14", "Haha. Luckily I think they discontinued the bears with lycasin.", "Sounds like my MIL - slipping allergens into foods that don't usually have them.  I would pick SO up something on the way BUT not just anything.  Find the most desirable, aromatic, food you can find.  Make it upstage anything she could have made.  Have the other guests drooling and asking questions.  You have to play moms game and WIN.", "Well no, she is not adult enough to say that, instead she is pulling these underhanded stunts that are borderline murder attempts.", "Not everywhere, but your would hope your own parents could manage one nut free meal so your partner can safely enjoy a Xmas meal. \n\nAlso, a nut free meal really isn\u2019t that difficult to accommodate. If you want to.", "I *refuse* not to laugh at this", "I think she will, it seems she dislikes -IL but not her kid, and is acting passive agressive\n\nPerhaps she will end up crying and shit about how SO is ruining her family and stuff \n\nOr i have spent too much time on JustNoMil... idk.", "It doesn\u2019t sound like they want to, at all, for several years.  Christmas candies and treats normally use nuts."]}
