{"id": 31983, "submission_id": "186u3ut", "title": "AITA for telling my sister it\u2019s her own fault her family is a mess because she wanted to adopt?", "selftext": "My sister \u201cLucy\u201d (38) has always wanted a big family. She and her husband \u201cTom\u201d (40), had their son \u201cLogan\u201d (now 9), but due to complications Lucy couldn\u2019t have more kids. Lucy was devastated. About three years ago, she and Tom decided to adopt. Tom never outright said he didn't want to go through with it, but it was clear to see he didn\u2019t care one way or the other and just wanted Lucy happy. Logan said he didn\u2019t want a sibling. Lucy brushed over all these concerns with the \u201cthey\u2019ll get on board eventually\u201d attitude. \n\nLong story short, they were eventually matched with boy, \u201cJack\u201d, who is now 11. Lucy said they all bonded, but Jack had behavioural issues and whenever I saw them, I picked up on the fact that over time Tom seemed to be getting less and less keen, and many times when it was just adults he commented on his worry that Jack had latent issues because of his traumatic past. Lucy adored Jack and rubbished these concerns. I brought up Tom\u2019s hesitation but Lucy said it was just taking longer for him to bond. \n\nThey officially adopted Jack about a year ago, and since then things have fallen apart. Jack\u2019s behaviour has either got a lot worse or Lucy wasn\u2019t speaking about it as much before, but it\u2019s clear Tom is at his wit\u2019s end. According to Lucy he works late constantly and whenever Jack has a tantrum he helps Lucy calm him down, and then takes Logan and leaves the house. Logan now hates Jack and won\u2019t play with him which causes more issues, and he\u2019s started to act out. He spent his last school holiday with my family and is set to spend Christmas with us again because even the family therapist says it\u2019s good for him to have some space. \n\nHaving seen this all unfold has been heartbreaking. Tom and Logan look more miserable every time I see them and though Lucy would never admit it, she does too. Whenever I speak to her she talks about how hard it is but always has Tom and Logan at fault. She has never taken any accountability for the fact that she didn\u2019t listen to anyone\u2019s concerns. \n\nShe called me a couple of days ago to discuss plans for Christmas and when Tom would be dropping Logan off at my home. She again started ranting about Tom has basically shut down at home with her and Jack and how she thinks he\u2019s going to leave. She was calling him every name in the book and then started saying she was disappointed that Logan doesn\u2019t love Jack and she can\u2019t believe she raised a bully. I lost it. I told her the really bully was her, she bullied her family into adoption as a form of wish fulfilment and Tom shouldn\u2019t have indulged her but most of the blame falls on her for destroying her family. She screamed and cried and eventually called me evil and hung up.\n\nMy parents are now saying I was an AH for telling her that even though we all think it, but I think she needed to hear it, and stop blaming her own child for being unhappy living in the chaos she created.\n\nEdit - for everyone saying I said or implied that Tom is blameless, I didn\u2019t. I said to Lucy that Tom shares the blame, but I do think most of it lies with her. Who I don\u2019t think has any blame, no matter how she\u2019s tried to place it on him, is Logan.

She was on bedrest for months to avoid a premature birth.  When that child was 2 and my wife was 36, we decided she should not get pregnant again so I had a vasectomy.\n\nFive years later, her unwed teenage cousin had her baby taken by CPS.  The cousin herself was a late adoption and always in trouble.  She drank during the pregnancy and was neglecting the baby.  My wife's aunt was well-known to CPS, fostered a lot of kids and adopted some, but was over 60 at this point.  She asked my wife if she wanted to foster this baby.\n\nLong story short, we adopted. I didn't particularly want another child at age 38, but I thought it would help my marriage because my wife had been regretting not having more kids.  The stress of having such a difficult child (fetal alcohol syndrome, attachment disorder, etc.) contributed to our eventual divorce.  \n\nI still think it's the right thing to do, to adopt children when you are able.  But it is VERY important to consider the whole family.  In this case it was a 3mo old who probably would have otherwise been adopted by a younger, childless couple who could give him their undivided attention.", "NTA, but what kind of parent adopts a child OLDER than their own biological child?!  I'm surprised the adoption agency didn't pick up on that during the interview.", "I don\u2019t believe this story. When going through adoption, you are screened and interviews multiple times. Logan would have expressed not wanting a brother during that interview, and adoption process would be shut down. Unless Logan just lied multiple times and played happy.", "This is just another great example of why Adoption should not be used as a replacement for infertility or used for family expansion.\n\nAdoption NEEDS to be child centered. Jack should\nHave been placed at a home with people who were trauma informed and had previous experience with children with trauma.", "NTA - Obviously we are only getting your side of the story, but man it certainly does paint a picture!\n\n>My sister \u201cLucy\u201d (38) has always wanted a big family. She and her husband \u201cTom\u201d (40), had their son \u201cLogan\u201d (now 9), but due to complications Lucy couldn\u2019t have more kids. Lucy was devastated. About three years ago, she and Tom decided to adopt. Tom never outright said he didn't want to go through with it, but it was clear to see he didn\u2019t care one way or the other and just wanted Lucy happy. Logan said he didn\u2019t want a sibling. Lucy brushed over all these concerns with the \u201cthey\u2019ll get on board eventually\u201d attitude.\n\nI think everyone knows one of these people, who justify and project and act like their wants are everyone else's just so they can feel good about their choices.  \n\n\nBut then, when they find out that isn't (and was never) the case, they all of a sudden are clueless and blindsided. \n\nSounds like no one ever told your sister \"no\". It's understandable to have wants and expectations for your life, of course, but the Rolling Stones have said it best \"you can't always get what you want\".   \n\n\nInstead of treasuring her biological son and being grateful for him, she tried to pivot and force that big family she always wanted by adopting, and no one had the balls to speak up then, either.   \n\n\nAnd even now, there's no culpability, no ownership, no self reflection... It's her son and husbands fault. It's unreal.  \n\n\nI'm sure people will tell you you're the asshole for telling her, and that you didn't need to do it, but I can't agree. She needed to hear it and its time she started to take some personal responsibility for her actions.", "NTA. While Tom may be a soft A himself, I can see where he comes from - he probably accepted in order to appease his wife, and he couldn't win in the situation - either his wife would have been permanently angry/disappointed/sad, or he had to try and accept her pledge to adopt a child.\n\nIn all of this, she is the one who refuses to see the problem, and even prioritized Jack over Logan (even when Jack wasn't her son yet), and now is even placing the blame on Logan (a child!) calling him a bully just because he doesn't want to stay with Jack. At least Tom seems to be trying to care about his son, while she's not!\n\nShe is digging her own grave, I'm afraid. If she at least recognised her own fault in this, and if she stopped blaming exclusively Logan (who has no blame) and Tom (who may have some, but way less than her), she could try and save something in her relationship with them. Otherwise, I'm afraid both of them would distance themselves from her, sooner or later. Especially Logan - poor boy, he probably can't wait to be old enough to get away from his mother and adoptive brother.", "Why is Tom absolved. You are making a lot of assumptions, you know what Tom thinks and you know what your parents thinks, I highly doubt that. You don't sound genuine in your post.", "why are there so many shitty adoption troll posts lately? tbh as an adopted kid it really makes me feel like shit.", "NTA OP she DID need to hear that. What a selfish person, ignoring her family just because SHE and only she wanted another kid and never considered the ramifications. Yes Tom is at fault for not being decisive and engaged and was very meek as well, but this is really on your sister. Logan made his opinion VERY clearly at an age where conflict often will only solidify and amplify that stance more each day. Not always, but in this instance it's very clear. It was never going to work, there was never a crack in the door to allow Jack in, but she still steamrolled him. Logan should have come first, not her wish fulfillment.\n\nThis will sound cruel, but they need to place Jack back into the system. As heartbreaking as it is, she needs to have her priorities straight and fix the family she messed up. Jack is sadly the one to get the short end of the stick, but that is the ONLY solution. It sounds like he needs another home that can deal with his problems anyway, and his issues will only get worse in that house and make everyone more miserable.\n\nTherapy won't work for this, people delude themselves into thinking it can solve anything (therapists included) but it can't. It can help with a LOT of problems, but I have seen this before and it rarely does in such a situation. At most they (in this case Logan) make nice and all, but at 18 their relationships with their parents just falls apart from anger, bitterness and resentment. Logan will likely never forgive her/them or adjust unless Jack goes back. Luke can't even do Christmas and other holidays with family and your therapist justifies it by saying he needs space?! SHE IS LITERALLY PUSHING HIM OUT OF THE FAMILY FOR HER ADOPTED SON! That is the worst advice a therapist can give in this situation and they are grasping as straws WHILE MAKING IT WORSE. I have seen it before. Her marriage will probably end as well. She was selfish person, a terrible mother and her husband is a meek tool and now everyone is suffering.\n\nI would call CPS anonymously and let them know you think they can't handle Jack's issues in the family dynamics and to speak with Logan alone specifically as he is suffering the most to the point he can't even spend holidays with them and the whole family is falling apart. CPS won't be happy about that and Jack will most likely be taken back. As an uncle, I would do it in a heartbeat to protect my nephews (and I love my siblings) and I know a couple people who have been in nearly identical situations who did the same. Is is a bit extreme? No, just feel like it. Is it the best for all parties? Yes as they can't handle Jack now and Luke will eventually start acting VERY BADLY towards him. More trauma is not what the kid needs, either of them. Is it possible to have a better outcome for all parties than Jack leaving? No.\n\nedited for typos", "And Jack. Jack is also blameless.\n\nUgh what a horrible situation. It's so hard when the only fix is to go back to the past and not do the thing you should never have done in the first place. I even feel badk for Lucy, because how on earth is she going to move forward? But you are NTA for telling her the truth. She needed to hear it.", "NTA. \n\nYou get to have an opinion on this issue both because your sister is talking to you about it and you are taking on caring for Logan because of what is happening in that household. \n\nAnd yes, absolutely Tom is an adult who is just as responsible as Lucy is for this situation. The two of them together have allowed this situation, and it sounds like neither did the work at all to make this family work. Adoption, especially adding in a family member later to a family unit, isn't easy, but that doesn't mean it has to be this hard, and it is very worthwhile. There should have been lots of therapy, lots of conversations, lots of reality checks, and lots of accommodations all around. \n\nShe also need to hear this, maybe not exactly as you said it, but it is clear she has been pushing of reality for awhile, and still is in a different way by not taking any responsibility and even blaming her own 9 year old for her decisions. Logan needs an ally, and I'm glad he has you.", "NTA. The truth hurts.  Your sister was selfish and ignored major issues her family had with this plan. She will be single with this adopted kid son.", "NTA. The truth is sometimes brutal, but in cases like this it needed to be said. Unfortunately it is also often the case that they tend to shoot the messenger for telling it.", "ESH\n\nHow does Tom being indifferent at the beginning become him \"bullied\" at the end.\n\n>even though we all think it,\n\nYour sister AND her husband made a choice and it's not working out.  It's not up to you as an outside party to come in and assign singular blame, it's also really shitty for her to blame her son.  None of this is productive and only leading to more negativity.", "ESH.\n\nThis child should not have been adopted unless everyone was on board. \n\nAdoption is a long and difficult process in most places. For the adoption to go through that means anyone who was hesitant didn\u2019t speak up or outright lied throughout the process. Extended family are often also interviewed in this process - if they had concerns and had the opportunity but said nothing then they are also partially at fault.\n\nI don\u2019t not blame any children in this situation but I do blame all the adults who didn\u2019t speak up. Your sister isn\u2019t the only person at fault here.", "NTA\n\nYou were right and now everyone is miserable because she only was concerned with what she wanted instead of facing the reality of the situation", "YTA - in order for you to adopt, there are required training and interviews and extensive paperwork.  So, in order to be approved, both parents had to be enthusiastic and willing.  I\u2019m concerned that you seem to be blaming one person for the dynamics and the adoptive kid.  Somehow, if she had another through biological means and her husband checked out, would you give him the same pass to be an ass? \n\nClearly, the family is in crisis and could use some professional help, kind words and encouragement.", "Just because it\u2019s true doesn\u2019t mean it needs to be said. \n\nAlso Jack is a grown man. He could have said no. \n\nPlus you if you are adopting an emotionally complicated child they should always be the YOUNGEST in the family. The adoption agency should have told her this. \n\nHelp her connect with specialists to help with her son\u2019s behavior. This has to be so hard on her.", "NTA. Your sister wants to pretend that she isn\u2019t at fault for any of this and is expecting everyone else to play along. She\u2019s disrupted her son\u2019s home and then calls him a bully for not playing along? Yikes. \n\nHopefully Tom leaves her and takes Logan with him.", "YTA. \nAdoption is long process, if Tom didn't want to go through with it he had plenty of opportunities to speak up and say no. If he was too cowardly to openly say no, there are plenty of ways he could have quietly torpedoed the adoption, you have to meet a lot of criteria to be assessed suitable, he could have f**cked it up. Lucy didn't force him into this, if Tom wasn't willing to refuse the adoption, that's on him.\n\nTom made the choice to become Jack's parent. But now it's difficult he's leaving Lucy to deal with it on her own. Working late and then leaving the house after work because your kid has behavioural issues and you don't want to deal with them is being a crappy parent and a crappy spouse. And it is absolutely feeding into Jack and Logan's problems. Treating Jack like he's not part of the family is not going to help Jack or Logan. \n\nSo yeah, Lucy was overly optimistic about Jack's behavioural problems, but she's by no means the first parent to be that way. She went into this thinking she would be part of a team and now she's on her own. Tom is an AH for agreeing to the adoption and then abandoning his post. And OP is AH for absolving Tom for his part in this, acting like 'difficult' adopted kids don't also deserve homes and for what he said to Lucy.\n\n(Edit for grammar/typo)", "NTA\n\nDid you actually think your sister was ever going to take accountability for anything?\n\nDon't be delusional.\n\nYour sister has wrecked her own life.  Stay out of it but be supportive of Tom when he finally walks out for good.  Hopefully, he can get custody of Logan, too, but I would not be at all surprised if the courts make that poor kid stay with his loony mother.\n\nBe aware:  You are on Reddit.  Being the man, Tom will get most of the blame and poor Lucy will get sympathy.\n\nIf Tom had told Lucy absolutely not when asked about adoption and put his foot down, he would be called controlling or any number of the popular buzzwords.", "NTA.  Sometimes, the truth hurts.  It doesn't mean it shouldn't have been said.", "Maybe you\u2019re technically NTA, but you sure weren\u2019t being very kind. Maybe it\u2019s true that your sister shouldn\u2019t have adopted, but she did, and now this is her life. It sounds like she\u2019s struggling immensely, and likely headed for divorce and maybe raising her adopted son on her own. She doesn\u2019t need you to kick her while she\u2019s down. I think this was one of those times when being kind is more important than being right.", "ESH\n\nTom is not an innocent party here. If he went along with adopting a whole ass child even though he didn\u2019t want to, only to resent the kid and avoid his family, he sucks massively.\n\nYour sister sucks for bitching to you so much. \n\nYou suck for getting so involved in this and blaming your sister so much for having a fucked up family (which happens plenty often in bio families.)", "ESH, You, Lucy and Tom\n\nI\u2019ll agree that Lucy played a big part in this and isnt\u2019t holding herself accountable but Tom is also at fault. While it might have been clear to you how he felt, you also admit Tom never vocalized his concerns and has been rather passive overall. They both played parts here. Couples are supposed to communicate ESPECIALLY for important, life changing joint decisions like adoption, and that didn\u2019t happen. It\u2019s not fair to put all the blame between one or the other.", "YTA, because you\u2019re bringing this up far too late.  The time to speak up was before the adoption was finalized. After that, Jack became their child and the damage was done. The time for criticism and blame-assignment ended and the time for support began. What are they going to do, send the kid back? \n\nEveryone in this family needs therapy and my heart bleeds for them all. I hope they can move forward together.", "NTA.  She needed a dose of truth and while you were punished for it, I hope it is able to help the family. That poor kid...", "The truth really stings sometimes.  You just had the courage to speak what everyone else was to chicken to say.  Unfortunately for her and the adopted child, the marriage probably won\u2019t last and the children will never be family.  So sorry you got all the crap thrown at you.", "NTA - They should have adopted a little girl under 5 years old. Their son likely would enjoy being the big brother to his sister. She would be the 'baby' of the family. More harmonious home environment.", "NTA. Sure Tom has some blame, but it's on another magnitude, barely any compared to the real person who caused all this to happen and blinded herself to how others felt in the family. What a mess, I probably would have been that honest myself.", "Logan has no blame in this. Kids growing up don\u2019t get along with siblings sometimes even when they share 100% blood. The husband should not have let this happen, he needed to put his foot down. This is equally his fault. Your sister takes no responsibility, and your parents are soft. I\u2019m sure it hurts them to see their daughter\u2019s marriage and family collapsing but maybe they also contributed to the way she is. I\u2019d disregard what they have to say in this instance IMO.\n\nShould you have \u201clost it\u201d? Probably not and that does make you kind of an AH. But telling her what you did isn\u2019t what makes you an AH. \n\nNTA ultimately", "NTA. Man, I\u2019m pissed at the sister.", "NYA, she couldn't hear that she created this problem and now she has.  I hope Tom will keep Logan when he leaves. It's only a matter of time. Loving Jack will *not* fix him, he needs lots of therapy, boundaries, consequences and maybe meds in addition to lots of love.", "NTA. Hopefully she listened to you. Regardless it needed to be said by someone. I don\u2019t agree that a 9 year old should get to dictate if they get a sibling or not. That being said I wouldn\u2019t have adopted a child older than my 9 year old. I also wouldn\u2019t have adopted a child with trauma if I already had a child. It is still possibly that Logan is bullying Jack but that would still be her fault. Kids act out when their needs are not being met and I\u2019m sure Logan is angry with Jack for \u201ctaking his mom\u201d. I understand that it is good for Logan to have his space but I\u2019m sure that is also growing resentment towards his mom and Jack. I think adopting would have gone a lot smoother if your sister didn\u2019t just jump at the first child they had available.", "NTA, the biggest Arseholes might even be your parents for being too cowardly to bring that message themselves. _Yes, she needed to know that but now she's in distress and that's __your__ fault!_", "NTA  \nYour sister didnt give a shit about nobody but herself and now she is labeling her victims as the bully.  \nShe ruined her husband married life and she ruined the nuclear home of Logan.", "ESH.\n\nTom, if not on board, could have used his words and said \"NO.\" Granted, Lucy is being resentful of Logan, who is not at all at fault - he had no say and his status has irrevocably changed. He can't be made to \"love\" what to him, is an interloper, and obviously he's also dealing with resentment as to his parents who he no doubt feels \"did this to him.\" \n\nIt wasn't your place to interfere, and Lucy alone did not create the \"chaos.\" It's sad for everyone involved.", " NTA. Someone had to say it.", "I think YTA... You say she bullied everyone too it, but loads of kids say they don't want siblings, would you call her selfish if she had a biological child? Tom was indifferent, sounds like was happy either way, not bullied.\n\nI think you'd be right to say that when people adopt they need to be equipped that the child comes with a past, which sometimes needs a lot of patience and support. Especially older kids. I commend her for pushing through. However I think you'd be right to say her lack of preparedness if any, and Tom's lack of engagement at the start or now and his lack of preparedness, both have more or less equal accountability. Tom had to agree to it at the end of the day.\n\nNow if she's not taking a compassionate approach to Logan and tom, you can say that to her and suggest that perspective, but it sounds like you attacked her, someone who is dealing with a difficult situation, rather than give her perspective.", "ESH.\n\nFrom what you said, she didn't 'bully' anyone into the adoption. It sounded like Tom was okay with their having one child but was on board with adoption. He could have easily just said absolutely not, and if she went through with it still \\[which I don't see how she could without the consent of her husband\\] then that would be different.\n\nAlso, of course a 6 year old would say they don't want a sibling...it's not unheard of for a child to say they don't want siblings \\[although my son is extremely excited about being a brother at the age of 5\\] but there are many times in which some kids like having all their parents attention. While it is of course important to get the opinion of family, a 6 year old should not be the be all end all of decision making when it comes to a serious family change.\n\nAs for the behavioral issues, that could have happened if they had a biological child, and then what would they do? Ship him off to boarding school or put him up for adoption?\n\nI will say that your sister is an AH for blaming her husband and son. It isn't their fault. It's no ones fault really, but you saying that she's to blame is an AH move because it's not really her fault either. She wanted another child, her husband was on board and could have said no at literally any time during the lengthy process to adopt.\n\nI would hope that your sister has Jack in therapy to help him with his trauma and issues he's facing, so she would also be the AH if she isn't doing anything to try to help him. Also family therapy is a good idea too.\n\nNone of this means you get to blame your sister for wanting another child.\n\nEdit: I changed my verdict because your sister also sucks for her behavior towards you and her family, and also Tom is not innocent because as I said, it's a long process to adoption and at any point he could have said no and the adoption wouldn't have gone through. It's not like picking up an animal from a pet store, both parents have to be completely on board for the process to go through.", "NTA - the truth isn't pretty but your sister made her choices and has to live with the consequences. Nor was anything said out of malice.\n\nYou shouldn't have to walks round eggshells or lie to your sister, that isn't fair to you.", "Esh. Except the kids. Everyone needs therapy and you should stay in your lane.", "ESH  \n\n\nLucy and Tom are clearly not properly equipped to deal with a child with special needs. Poor Jack probably needs more help and resources. Being put through the foster system, being orphaned in any way is traumatizing and causes issues, but that doesn't make Jack less worthy of love. Lucy and Tom should've thought more and spoken together more as a couple. They should have considered and discussed the possible issues and difficulties of raising and adopting a child from the foster system.  \nYou're the asshole for treating the adopted child as the problem and uplifting Tom for his lack of empathy towards a troubled CHILD. Lucy definitely should have thought this through more, but I don't see her desire to have children as selfish, just her lack of research as very irresponsible and careless.", "NTA. This is just one of many, many adoption horror stories I\u2019ve read about. Lucy sounds delusional AH.\n\nEveryone loves to shoot the messenger though. I once gave my brother a message about his fianc\u00e9 that my entire family agreed with but was too cowardly to say it. My brother hated me for it for a couple years, and my family never took ownership of their part.", "NTA.\n\nBut only because her calling her own son a bully is beyond the pale to me.\n\nBesides that I mostly feel sorry for all involved.\n\nIf your sister admits adopting this child was a mistake that's a massive asshole move. \n\nThe husband shares more blame in just going along with things than I think you're giving him, even if she was the main force behind it. \n\nShe's lashing out. Which I imagine is fairly annoying. But also her family is disintegrating and it doesn't feel like much can be done to stop it, and she's practically getting all the blame for it. You can't go back in time and unadopt a whole human being, it'd be evil.\n\nThere's only so much that therapy and time and adjustment can do, if fundamentally half the family unit regrets the adoption.", "NTA\n\nI see some people saying everyone sucks, but hind sight is always 20/20. Should all of you spoken up sooner? Hell yes. But in those moments Lucy was doing everything she could to lay peoples concerns to rest. Social pressure is to play along and I don't blame you.  \nTom as you said is at fault still, he should have spoken up. And you finally exploding is just the pressure building. A lot of YTA/ESH comments forget that while we all want to be perfect in every moment, sometimes we want to think the best of people. I don't doubt there was times when \"Maybe Lucy is right, Tom will come around.\", \"Jack doesn't want a brother now, but Lucy thinks he'll enjoy it once he knows what it's like. She is his mother after all.\"\n\nI wish a lot of you would have spoken up earlier. But the asshole is Lucy for not listening to the concerns brought up. To going through with this choice without a husband and son 100% on board. Were there other bad choices made here? Yes, but I sympathize with the faults here.\n\nLong story short, you aren't the asshole for finally having enough. She built this castle that's crumbling and she's not taking her share of the blame for it's construction.", "ESH What a mess all of this is.", "YTA.

She and her husband \u201cTom\u201d (40), had their son \u201cLogan\u201d (now 9), but due to complications Lucy couldn\u2019t have more kids. Lucy was devastated. About three years ago, she and Tom decided to adopt. Tom never outright said he didn't want to go through with it, but it was clear to see he didn\u2019t care one way or the other and just wanted Lucy happy. Logan said he didn\u2019t want a sibling. Lucy brushed over all these concerns with the \u201cthey\u2019ll get on board eventually\u201d attitude. \n\nLong story short, they were eventually matched with boy, \u201cJack\u201d, who is now 11. Lucy said they all bonded, but Jack had behavioural issues and whenever I saw them, I picked up on the fact that over time Tom seemed to be getting less and less keen, and many times when it was just adults he commented on his worry that Jack had latent issues because of his traumatic past. Lucy adored Jack and rubbished these concerns. I brought up Tom\u2019s hesitation but Lucy said it was just taking longer for him to bond. \n\nThey officially adopted Jack about a year ago, and since then things have fallen apart. Jack\u2019s behaviour has either got a lot worse or Lucy wasn\u2019t speaking about it as much before, but it\u2019s clear Tom is at his wit\u2019s end. According to Lucy he works late constantly and whenever Jack has a tantrum he helps Lucy calm him down, and then takes Logan and leaves the house. Logan now hates Jack and won\u2019t play with him which causes more issues, and he\u2019s started to act out. He spent his last school holiday with my family and is set to spend Christmas with us again because even the family therapist says it\u2019s good for him to have some space. \n\nHaving seen this all unfold has been heartbreaking. Tom and Logan look more miserable every time I see them and though Lucy would never admit it, she does too. Whenever I speak to her she talks about how hard it is but always has Tom and Logan at fault. She has never taken any accountability for the fact that she didn\u2019t listen to anyone\u2019s concerns. \n\nShe called me a couple of days ago to discuss plans for Christmas and when Tom would be dropping Logan off at my home. She again started ranting about Tom has basically shut down at home with her and Jack and how she thinks he\u2019s going to leave. She was calling him every name in the book and then started saying she was disappointed that Logan doesn\u2019t love Jack and she can\u2019t believe she raised a bully. I lost it. I told her the really bully was her, she bullied her family into adoption as a form of wish fulfilment and Tom shouldn\u2019t have indulged her but most of the blame falls on her for destroying her family. She screamed and cried and eventually called me evil and hung up.\n\nMy parents are now saying I was an AH for telling her that even though we all think it, but I think she needed to hear it, and stop blaming her own child for being unhappy living in the chaos she created.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "Justified AH.\n\nYou spoke cruel truth to someone who will find herself a divorced single mother to one son (Jack) soon. Logan will want to live with his father, and he is about old enough to make that choice.\n \nYour sister can't improve her family life if she won't accept responsibility for her part and start making changes. Period.", "Sounds like the chaos has been created by an absentee father IMO parents don't get to just shut down because their child is difficult. Life would probably be a lot easier if Tom would step up and be a dad. I think that's the conversation that must be had.", "ESH. \n\nIf Tom didn\u2019t want to adopt Jack he should have spoken up. Adoption is a lengthy process there was plenty of time for them to have an open and honest conversation. Logan while not at fault is hardly the first child to say no to a sibling or struggle to bond with said sibling once they arrive. \n\nAt this point Lucy needs some self reflection. Her husband and bio child not responding the way she wants doesn\u2019t mean that they are wrong or that her child is a bully. \n\nAs for you, sometimes being \u2018right\u2019 isn\u2019t the most important thing. Your sister needs support and you could have phrased what you wanted to say. Your sister could be having the same problem if they\u2019d had another bio child would you have reacted the same way.", "YTA,and you\u2019re not the only one apparently. Your sister is in an unimaginably difficult situation right now, and she needs your support. Criticizing her is not the same thing. Keep in mind that every child who is adopted has trauma in their background. It\u2019s just the way it is. I agree that your sister made a lot of mistakes. But again, she needs you to help not hurt. I\u2019m glad to hear that they have a family therapist, but it\u2019s time to move onto something more effective. Most adoption agencies provide follow-up support. I hope that\u2019s the case for her family. Note that I say family because they are all family now regardless of how everybody feels about it. I hope that you will apologize and ask if there\u2019s anything you can do to help. The person who needs the most help is Jack, but he needs professional, knowledgeable help. Now he has been traumatized by the process of being adopted, as well as the process of losing his birth family.", "NTA\n\nAdoption and birth order are a big deal.  I worked with older kids in foster care for a bit a long time ago.  They come with their own special issues, unless it's a family adoption.  Unfortunately, my guess is this was rushed. \n\nI have no doubt that Logan and Tom went along with the tsunami of Lucy's desire for a larger family as she failed to address her own feelings of inadequacy for not being to birth more kids.  Logan and Tom wanted Lucy to be happy but likely secretly wondered \"why aren't we enough?!\"\n\nI'm glad to read they are all in therapy.  You delivered harsh truths when Lucy was projecting blame without acknowledging her own role.  Much more therapy needed.", "ESH  plus the fact you\u2019re calling this behaviour a tantrum shows you have decided to do zero educating yourself on your nephew. \n\nThey have two kids and one has some kind of additional need probably autism. This requires lots of support for siblings and the family in general which they (or you!) haven\u2019t done. \n\nHer husband is equally responsible for their two children and him leaving her with all the responsibilities because it\u2019s convenient for him clearly makes him A H too", "I feel,the adoptive mother is not to blame. This child must have not only abandent issues but trust issues as well. I feel his acting out is a form of \u201ctesting the waters\u201d  I think you are the \u201cA\u201d for not supporting your sister. The world needs more compassionate people like your sister.", "YTA.  Your response to sister was not helpful because it was delivered in the form of an accusation.  A more caring, but still descriptive reply might have been better received.   \nHer tale is another example of the too often tragedy of adoption.  All children deserve a safe and happy environment to grow up in.  The adoptive parents don't know that many of the children are physically harmed by the drugs that the birth mother was taking, or by the brutality of the child's environment.  The adoption agency and government emphasize that they are held completely harmless for the physical and mental condition of the child both past and future.  Adoptive parents think that the child's needs will be fulfilled by the love, care, and environment that they will provide.   For many ... all's well that ends well.  For too many the challenge is overwhelming and too often not successful.", "YTA - simple question would you say all this if she would have had another child naturally and they ended up having mental health issues, nope because it\u2019s her bio child. Your whole POV is skewed bc the child is adopted. Also, yes you did technically say spouse is at fault but you also said you lay the majority of the blame with your sister which is complete BS he is a grown man and was completely capable of saying and not going through the process especially if he wasn\u2019t 100% on board. \n\nAt the end of the day it wasn\u2019t your place to give an opinion on any of this. You literally could have just said \u201cI love you and support your family, but I think you need to talk to a professional about this instead of me.\u201d Let\u2019s me real though you don\u2019t love the adoptive kid bc he isn\u2019t blood and you can\u2019t fathom loving, supporting and helping someone through mental health issues *as your child* if they aren\u2019t biologically yours.", "YTA. If you don\u2019t want to hear her talk about you could have said so.  \n\nTelling someone they destroyed their family makes this situation so much worse.  The kid is there, they can\u2019t just undo this now.\n\nIf it\u2019s affecting you personally so much that you just had to say something that terrible, maybe you should have spoken up earlier about not wanting to hear their struggles.", "Surely Tom's the arsehold here for not making his wishes plain? If he didn't want another child he should have said so, amongst it her issues the adopted kid is likely picking up that his new Dad wasn't that into him from the off.\n\nI also think YTA a bit because this is a family that is struggling and could do with support, which you don't have to give, but blaming her makes no sense to me.", "YTA. Mind your business or help. Her adopting a child isn't why her family is falling apart. Her husband not mentioning that he didn't want to adopt is the problem that started it all. A kid is not a toy that you get to satisfy a desire. It is a whole other human being that requires love, patience and care. If he was never willing to give that to the child that HE AGREED to let enter his home, he should've said so from the beginning. Instead, he brought this child into his home AND adopted him. Now it is HIS job and his wife's job to get him the help he needs for his behavioral issues. Therapy is *required*. You had absolutely zero right to say any of that to her. If you're not gonna help, then shush.", "NTA \n\nWhen Tom finally voiced concerns about jack why did they not stop the adoption? When her own son was against it why wasn\u2019t that of major concern to her?\n\nOne thing that really pisses me off about this is that the child with the behavioral issues is being prioritized and she remains in denial about those issues. What a punishment to her biological child. I\u2019ll never understand parents neglecting their better behaved/less troublesome children for the ones that cause the most trouble and are least likely to gain independence. I can only imagine how Logan is hurting. If he never looks back on her when she\u2019s an adult I wouldn\u2019t blame him. She can make merry with tantrums and jail work into the future all by herself with Jack. Were I Logan as an adult, she definitely can\u2019t come to me if she\u2019s in a rut, she\u2019d have to go to the one she prioritized.", "It sounds like they need intense family counseling. Is that not a part of adoption? Im also clueless on the process\u2026", "NTA\nOP your sister is a bad mother. She has basically neglected her actual child for that isn't even biologically hers. That matter here because Logan will most likely grown up thinking his mother replaced him becuase he wasn't good enough which is really sad. \nTom's only fault in this situation is not putting his foot down with Lucy, but let's be real here if she saw how he was acting had her son tell her no to a sibling and then she blatantly goes along with her plan anyway saying \"they'll get on board\" how much fault can you put on Tom if she would have done it anyway?", "ESH. \n\n>Tom never outright said he didn't want to go through with it, but it was clear to see he didn\u2019t care one way or the other and just wanted Lucy happy. Logan said he didn\u2019t want a sibling.\n\nI don't buy that it was so obvious Tom wasn't on board because adoption is a really extensive process. He and the family would have been screened before and after adoption and placement to ensure this was a good fit for all involved. If he did have reservations, he needed to voice them sooner and stand his ground. But now, they've officially adopted Jack and this means Tom needs to be doing his part as a parent to support not one but both of their kids.\n\nLogan saying he doesn't want a sibling isn't really surprising either. If you ask most kids this question, they'll say no. This is really too complex a question and a decision to leave up to a nine year old. \n\n>According to Lucy he works late constantly and whenever Jack has a tantrum he helps Lucy calm him down, and then takes Logan and leaves the house. Logan now hates Jack and won\u2019t play with him which causes more issues, and he\u2019s started to act out.\n\nSo it sounds like Tom is never home and not an active participant in the household. He leaves whenever there are issues, and Logan refuses to interact with Jack either. Did you ever wonder if Jack's negative behaviors are a result of being treated poorly by his \"family\"? He has an adopted father who flees whenever the kid has issues, and an adopted brother who refuses to interact with him.\n\n>I think she needed to hear it, and stop blaming her ***own child*** for being unhappy living in the chaos she created.\n\nThis is a huge issue on your end. You need to realize that she ADOPTED Jack. That is also now her kid, and this idea that Logan is a bigger priority than Jack and should be is a problem on your end. Everyone treating Jack like an outsider when he is supposed to be part of the family is definitely an issue.\n\nWhat you said to your sister was out of line and also unfair to her. it's unlikely she \"bullied\" her family into adoption because it's a multi-step process and she didn't have a gun to anyone's head. Tom could have objected at any point, it's not like you can adopt a kid on a whim. It really seems like they committed to this decision in the beginning, and now Tom is bailing and not doing his part.\n\nYour sister is the only one trying to keep it all together, and instead of being helpful you're shaming her and blaming her.", "NTA. Someone needed to tell your sister the truth", "ESH except the kids.\n\nLucy for not watching and listening to her son and husband and *not doing the research* on parenting kids with serious trauma and behavioral issues. Jack", "NTA\n\nYou told her the truth, and after she asked to hear it. I feel really bad for Logan in this situation, and Tom as well. It seems like your sister is kind of dragged them into a Quagmire.", "ESH. Adopting kids is hard. Especially because you are very likely to get a troubled child. My sister adopted a few years ago and it's been a tremendous challenge for our family dealing with one of the childrens behavior.\n\nYou took it a bit far but clearly she needs someone to talk to her about it. She has a singular focus on the adopted child and it's taking away from the rest of her relationships. She needs to be in therapy with that kid and her family. \n\nI finally said something to my sister earlier this year and it obviously didn't fix everything but things are improving very slowly and we're not the bad guy anymore when her kid steals from us.", "NTA, sometimes people need to hear the hard truth and they need to take accountability for their actions.  It sounds like Tom's going to leave with Logan and she's going to be stuck with Jack.", "NTA. While I agree that Tom shares the blame because he lied in the interview most likely, Lucy is totally to blame. If all the family members aren\u2019t bonding, adoption shouldn\u2019t even be considered and truthfully only Lucy bonded with Jack. Your sister is going to lose her family for the sake of wanting more kids. Who\u2019s to say Logan wouldn\u2019t have bonded under different circumstances. But those circumstances aren\u2019t present so he should have been considered as well. And age doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t happen. My granddaughter was 6 when her baby brother was born. After seeing she wasn\u2019t going to be left out, she was thrilled. I was surprised because of her age. And if Jack wasn\u2019t a troubled child (not his fault, he could have had a horrible home life before the foster system) then Logan might have bonded. Definitely NTA!", "YTA. Your sister is having family problems and the solution is to point at her and laugh?\n\nThe fuck is she supposed to do, unadopt the kid?", "NTA. Sometimes the truth hurts, but in this case it needed to be said. You\u2019re not doing her any favors by letting her live in a delusional little bubble where it\u2019s everyone else\u2019s fault but her own. That does not help anyone involved. Of course, she\u2019s going to shoot the messenger, but you are not wrong for telling her the truth.", "> But it is VERY important to consider the whole family.\n\nWhich is what a social worker does, especially when a family is adopting an older kid or adopting a kid older than their child. We adopted privately and are now considering fostering teens in the next couple of years because our two (well adjusted, loving, and awesome teenagers) are in college now. It is a long process to be approved to adopt. With our two domestic infant adoptions we had multiple family members interviewed to make sure we were fit to be parents. Neither Tom nor Logan gave the social worker any indication they were opposed to this? Why?", "And the judgement is....?", "Honestly, there\u2019s a LOT I\u2019m surprised wasn\u2019t picked up during the screening process", "Genuinely curious, why would adopting a child older than your bio child be bad?", "What\u2019d I miss?  What\u2019s wrong with adopting a child older than one\u2019s biological child?", "I adopted a pair of siblings when my bio-child was seven.  One six years old and the other twelve.  My bio-child was ecstatic to have a big sister.", "In my country it's not permitted.", "That was my first thought here as well.  No way in hell should they have adopted an older child when they already had a 9 year old.  A baby or anyone younger than 9 would have been a much better option.", "Especially if the child is a only child.  Of course it varies on an individual basis but in general it's easier adopting an older child if their bio child already has older siblings. They only have to adapt to having a new sibling rather than adapting to having a new sibling and adapting to having a older sibling.", "Literally what? Who cares if the kid is older than their own biological kid", "Why is that concerning? Genuinely asking, I don\u2019t know much about adoption and fostering.", ">NTA, but what kind of parent adopts a child OLDER than their own biological child?!  I'm surprised the adoption agency didn't pick up on that during the interview.\n\nRemember when almost everyone on AITA was calling \"Logan\" the AH last time this topic came up and any comments saying that \"Logan\" was *not* TA here were getting downvoted? If this post was from *Logan* complaining how he didn't like his adopted older brother, most people here would be dismissing him and calling him an AH for not accepting his older brother.", "Never underestimate a childs desire to make thier parent happy even if they dont agree.", "If this was done through a private agency it wouldn't surprise me if they let this through, they do anything for money.", "Trust me, I too am surprised they were allowed to adopt. Idk how diligent social workers are nowadays, not very, based on this experience.", "My cousin is doing this process and her oldest (12) is adamant against it and it\u2019s all going forward. And the kids are out of age order, the child they want to adopt is in the middle of their bio kids.  It doesn\u2019t make a bit of sense to me but it\u2019s happening", "That's definitely not how that always works. I told the case worker I was already providing care for my younger two siblings (one was disabled) and absolutely would be saddled with any more fostered with us and I firmly was against it and we got 4 more kids over several years over my objections.", "It sounds like they went through foster care and they don't screen a damn thing.", "My mind went to maybe Lucy told him to lie with the threat of punishment like grounding or something?", "What makes you think they just shut down the process because Logan expressed not wanting a brother?\n\nAs much as you want to believe the adoption process is full proof, its not.

She made the decision, her husband allowed himself to be dragged along, but Logan got told and shown outright his feelings didn't matter. Having a stranger air dropped into your life and home  is uncomfortable. Having it done when you explicitly said you didn't want it to happen, and then it's forced on you? She set this situation up to fail. Now throw in that Jack will not be the easiest kid to live with, he has multiple issues, not his fault but it is a factor. All of a sudden- Logan no longer has a safe space. He's coming home to conflict and stress, unfortunately he will see Jack as the problem.\nThis is not blaming Jack, this is blaming her for acting like adopting a kid , especially a kid who has gone through who knows what hell -is like getting a pet.She did not put thought or due consideration into this.\nJack needed a stable home. People who wanted him there, prepared to put in the work, and could devote time care and attention to what he needed.\nInstead he's got parachuted in to a situation where one adult is selfishly using  him for wish fulfillment\n( really hurtful to Logan if he knows, he'll think she's implying he's not good enough)\nAnother adult who didn't want him and is tolerating the situation.\nA kid who didn't want him there, and will see Jack as the cause for his family falling apart.\nHonestly the situation beforehand makes me think the relationship was on rocky ground to start with, and adopting was her way of  'fixing' things (which is awful) when all it did was bring things to a head.", "I hear you, sucks", "You shouldn't. There are far more marriage problem stories, and that doesn't mean my marriage is somehow terrible. \n\nDon't go looking for yourself in these stories.", "I agree. She doesn't say anywhere that Tom actually voiced concerns or hesitancy about adoption but just things she \"picked up on\". He adopted this kid too and it sounds like he has basically given up on him.  I feel bad for Logan, and yes, Lucy should have listened to his concerns more, but parents who want another child don't usually lean too heavily on the opinions of their other kids, although I know that adopting an older child comes with different challenges. I'm not saying Lucy is blameless, but sometimes well-intentioned actions go poorly and no one is really an asshole for them.", "This. The fact that the first few votes are saying OP isn't the AH and is making it seem like the sister twisted her husbands arm is beyond me. No where does it say the husband didn't consent. He just didn't care whether they had more children or not, but still went along with it. The process to adoption isn't like going to a pet store and picking out a pet, signing some papers and going home. The husband would have had to be on board enough to get through the entire process towards adoption.", "I explicitly said Tom is also at fault", "If he knew he didn\u2019t want to go through with the adoption and didn\u2019t disclose that, then he lied to his wife, multiple officials during the evaluation process and eventually in court. The situation wouldn\u2019t exist without that deception so I don\u2019t understand how he is barely responsible? Lucy may have been misguided in her intentions, but was always honest about them.", "Not to mention that when you have one difficult child (regardless of why they're difficult, it doesn't really matter), the less difficult one gets much less attention. I'm sure Logan (think I've got the right name, but their original kid is who I mean) has experienced what he probably senses to be a serious withdrawal of attention. That's enough to make a kid angry with everyone involved. It's also not constructive towards the two kids being friendly with each other.", "All of this. This is the answer. All y'all suck.

When the adoptee is older, these two factors clash instead of going hand in hand.", "I doubt there's many studies to back this up, but as someone who has considered adoption in the future, I would go for a younger child than my bio too. \n\nAdoption is traumatic for the child in and of itself (though usually less so than *not* being adopted, it's still important to recognize that there can be emotional fallout from the process) and the kids who need to be adopted usually didn't come from happy situations. They may have a history of other traumas, especially if they are not newborns. \n\nRaising a kid is a lot of new experiences on its own. I have one kid and every year brings new challenges, new situations to handle. No matter how many parenting books you read, a lot of it is figuring things out as you go along. You'll inevitably get a lot of things wrong with the first kid that you won't with the second or third, but being first also has some nice perks (I'm an oldest child myself) that kind of make up for parental inexperience. \n\nI would not want to be making these first-time-parent mistakes on a kid who already has a complicated and traumatic past. Letting a bio child be the oldest means you don't have to learn how to parent a teenager AND how to parent a teenager with PTSD at the same time. A portion of the parenting is been-there-done-that and you can focus more on the areas where they specifically need the most help, instead of trying to figure out the basics. \n\nAlso, and I hate to bring this up because it is not their fault at all and should not be held against them, but kids who have been traumatized can sometimes be violent or nasty to other kids. They still deserve loving, supportive parents who can help them learn better coping mechanisms and give them a good life, but the reality is that therapy doesn't magically fix things overnight and there may be a long road to healing before those kinds of behaviors stop, and any other children in the family are going to have to deal with it until then (see OP). It is much easier for an older child to deal with a younger one lashing out than vice-versa, even if it's just physically, and an older bio child can even be a model for acceptable behavior to a younger one. Few older kids are going to look up to a younger kid for behavioral cues if the roles are reversed. \n\nI don't think there should be any rule against adopting kids who are older than your current ones - all situations are different and unique, after all - but just speaking personally, I think there are a lot of legitimate reasons not to.", "Yes but those siblings were already used to sibling dynamics and since your bio-kid was smack in the middle they didn\u2019t have to adjust their behaviors very much.

A bio kid might hate having a new baby sibling because it takes up too much of mom and dad's time, but they might love having an older sibling because it's somebody cool to look up to...

Babies cry, little kids tantrum, older kids test boundaries, teens get moody and rebellious. Have more than one, and now you have potential clashes and power struggles that can last for years, that can escalate and piggy-back. Throw some trauma and/or mental illness in there and shit, brace yourself.\n\nI feel like that\u2019s part of raising a family. Any family. You\u2019re raising people, that have no autonomy or power, in a world that disfavours raising emotionally healthy children in stable households. And humans have a looooong maturity period.\n\nTo some extent, this is par for the course. This particular story may be harder than some other families have it, but kids bring complication and conflict. The best a parent can do is work through it healthily and hope for the best.", "Thank you for being the only person so far to actually explain the other side of things.", "I think the poster was not saying you shouldn\u2019t but that the most common advice is to adopt somebody younger because it\u2019s easier. \nI think people read things out of their comment that was not in it in the first place.\n\nI have no experience in this field but that\u2019s the way I understood his comment and it\u2019s seems quite logical to me. \n\nOf course some cases are different and then we have to do our best with what we have but why not start with the situation where people say \u00ab\u00a0this is the best scenario \u00ab\u00a0", "The difference is that making mermaids is obviously not true. They provided a valid perspective that to me, a layperson, made sense. I don\u2019t personally know any blended families or anything like that, so just telling me to talk to one is not helpful information. \n\nI\u2019m asking for more information to make an informed decision, but if none of you are going to provide explanations for your side of things, then it\u2019s fairly obvious which side I\u2019ll choose.", "Have you privately discussed this with Tom? I mean the situation with Logan. If he leaves he shouldn\u2019t leave Logan behind.", "But how does any of that involve Lucy more than it does Tom? They are equally responsible for the family and household. Tom is just as responsible for creating the environment that makes Logan unhappy, makes him have to stay elsewhere over holidays. \n\nYou can\u2019t say she knew. You don\u2019t even know what he felt. You think you could see it despite not knowing him that well. Maybe your perception was correct. You know who DID know for sure either way? TOM. Going along with it KNOWING he didn\u2019t want this child is worse than going along with it because you assume your husband is on board because he\u2019s telling you he\u2019s on board.", "It is now that you edited it. Thank you!", "They\u2019re all coming for Christmas Day along with my parents, but Logan is spending the whole of his Christmas holidays with us which is about three weeks.", "Sorry wasn\u2019t clear enough. By SO. I meant husband. So your child and HUSBAND don\u2019t want to move. You ignore them and do it anyways?", "Yes, but a new sibling is an even bigger change. I also think changing kids from their school and city should be done carefully. \n\nAnd I\u2019m not even saying you shouldn\u2019t move or adopt in any circumstances if the child doesn\u2019t want to, I\u2019m only saying that you should be a lot more careful about it if he doesn\u2019t want to. Which OP\u2019s sister wasn\u2019t.", "But they literally said \u201cyou shouldn\u2019t adopt out of birth order.\u201d", "I mean, you're the one shooting yourself in the foot with the last paragraph. Google is free. Other people not having that kind of time and energy to explain psychology should have no bearing on your will to educate yourself, or at the very least not to believe the first opinion you read on a subject. That's on you and it feels like you're selling yourself short by claiming a layperson should naturally accept whatever sounds reasonable. \n\nI also wasn't saying \"wtf go talk to a blended family, stupid,\" I was saying \"hey, think about how many blended families there are and the fact that it's not universally taboo (especially in the mental health/counseling community) and you'll see that their point was about as realistic as claiming mermaids can exist.\"", "Just on the occasions he\u2019s dropped Logan off. He\u2019s worried about him. I don\u2019t get the sense that he\u2019d leave Logan if the marriage failed.", "Okay, that\u2019s fair. I will said it\u2019s my *belief* that she knew. Based on the fact that when we (me and my parents) brought it up to her, her \u201cyes but\u201d responses constituted a tacit acknowledgment that that\u2019s how he felt, in my opinion. \n\nIt involves Lucy more because she\u2019s the one blaming Logan for being unhappy, and she\u2019s the one who spearheaded the idea to adopt Jack in the first place, in spite of the problems it was causing at the time. It\u2019s got worse since the adoption but there were issues prior, and we expressed concerns to her and she just kept saying it would be fine. To me that\u2019s grossly irresponsible. Tom, at least, expressed reservations and concerns, Lucy had none."]}
