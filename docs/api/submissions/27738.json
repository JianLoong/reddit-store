She is 3 and can say \u201cMama\u201d and \u201cDada\u201d. But she mostly says sounds like \u201cehhh\u201d when trying to communicate. I bring her to work with me because she is very behaved and quiet (because she is semi- nonverbal). I work at outdoor events like Farmers markets or festivals. I set up my stand, and I have a little table and chair for her \u201cstand\u201d too. She puts her toys out and works her booth like me. It\u2019s cute and other kids go to her booth and play with her. This particular time, she had some busy toys and a bubble maker wand she just brought back from the beach. \n\nShe doesn\u2019t mind any of the kids playing with them, but then 2 boys maybe around 8/9 came and were roughing up the toys. They were banging the wand on the table and my daughter was saying \u201cMama, ehh ehh ehh\u201d. \n\nI asked them to please play nice with my daughter\u2019s toys and they yelled No. I said okay then, I am going to put them away until they leave. They said it\u2019s their toys now and ran. \n\nI ran after them with my daughter in my arms, and a woman came out of know where and grabbed my arm. She screamed \u201cwhat the hell do I think I\u2019m doing chasing her sons\u201d. I told her to never touch me and her sons were stealing my daughter\u2019s toy. She said I am a grown adult and I shouldn\u2019t chase children, and her sons can play with that toy if they want to. I said I had no issue with them playing with it until they started banging it on the table and said they wouldn\u2019t give it back.  \n\nShe said \u201cwell, they can continue playing with it and will return it when they are done.\u201d\n\nI said that doesn\u2019t work for me and I took the toy back from her son\u2019s hands and walked away. I heard her call me a fucking bitch as we\u2019re walking.  \n\nMy sister thinks it was wrong for me to take the toy back. But I honestly was frustrated and wanted done with her and kids. We put the toys away until after we saw she left .\n\nAm I the asshole or fucking bitch?\n\n***Edit to add***\nMy \u201cchasing\u201d consisted of me briskly walking with my daughter in one arm, with my other arm flailing in the air \u201chey give that back\u201d lol.  They were about 20-30 feet in front of me. \n\nAlso my daughter was in my arms because after she said Mama, I picked her up because I saw she was holding back tears.", "created_utc": 1695830391, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16todr5/aita_for_chasing_a_kid_and_attempting_to_take_my/", "score": 2275, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The sense of entitlement of people today boggles my mind.", "NTA while I can understand the other mom having a knee jerk reaction at first when you explained it she should of told her kids to give it back.  While toys are play things in the eyes of adults not all toys are created equal in the eyes of a kid. A child can have a toy that was given to them by someone they were close to who passed away or as a token of comfort when going through a touch time in their life. Toys like those are extremely important. Another kid running off with it and breaking the toy would break the heart of anyone especially to those younger than the the thief who can\u2019t keep up.\n\nIt is the equivalent of you seeing the woman\u2019s wedding ring and wearing it because it matched your outfit. That ring has valuable meaning to her and she alone gets to decide who wears it. If her spouse had passed away even more so.\n\nIt is one thing to teach kids to share when warranted but sharing isn\u2019t always a great idea. Kids have so little control and if they have a toy snack that is important to them sharing shouldn\u2019t be forced. \n\nThat mother expected her kids to get everything and is quite entitled.", "NTA.\n\nA good rule of thumb in a situation like this where someone is like \"it's just a toy, it doesn't matter\" is to replace it with something else in the story. \n\nIf the boys had grabbed your purse and run off with it, would you be justified in chasing them? Of course. It would be absurd for the mom to say \"They'll give your purse back when they're done with it.\" Because *they took something that didn't belong to them* and that's called stealing. The only place where it matters how much the item was worth is in court. It doesn't matter if it was a pacifier, a rare artwork, or anything else.

They were bullying your daughter and the mother was saying that it was ok for them to do it. The behavior was appalling.", "NTA, but the mom and your sister are. You told them not to bang the toys.

And wth is wrong with your sister? She literally thinks the boys had a right to steal and keep your daughter's toy until they were ready to leave the market? I can't even with that shit.
