She is 3 and can say \u201cMama\u201d and \u201cDada\u201d. But she mostly says sounds like \u201cehhh\u201d when trying to communicate. I bring her to work with me because she is very behaved and quiet (because she is semi- nonverbal). I work at outdoor events like Farmers markets or festivals. I set up my stand, and I have a little table and chair for her \u201cstand\u201d too. She puts her toys out and works her booth like me. It\u2019s cute and other kids go to her booth and play with her. This particular time, she had some busy toys and a bubble maker wand she just brought back from the beach. \n\nShe doesn\u2019t mind any of the kids playing with them, but then 2 boys maybe around 8/9 came and were roughing up the toys. They were banging the wand on the table and my daughter was saying \u201cMama, ehh ehh ehh\u201d. \n\nI asked them to please play nice with my daughter\u2019s toys and they yelled No. I said okay then, I am going to put them away until they leave. They said it\u2019s their toys now and ran. \n\nI ran after them with my daughter in my arms, and a woman came out of know where and grabbed my arm. She screamed \u201cwhat the hell do I think I\u2019m doing chasing her sons\u201d. I told her to never touch me and her sons were stealing my daughter\u2019s toy. She said I am a grown adult and I shouldn\u2019t chase children, and her sons can play with that toy if they want to. I said I had no issue with them playing with it until they started banging it on the table and said they wouldn\u2019t give it back.  \n\nShe said \u201cwell, they can continue playing with it and will return it when they are done.\u201d\n\nI said that doesn\u2019t work for me and I took the toy back from her son\u2019s hands and walked away. I heard her call me a fucking bitch as we\u2019re walking.  \n\nMy sister thinks it was wrong for me to take the toy back. But I honestly was frustrated and wanted done with her and kids. We put the toys away until after we saw she left .\n\nAm I the asshole or fucking bitch?", "created_utc": 1695830391, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16todr5/aita_for_chasing_a_kid_and_attempting_to_take_my/", "score": 515, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She didn\u2019t want to have to discipline her kids and is probably tired of their antics. \n\nGood job mama.", "NTA. \n\nMy nephew is currently going through a phase of, \"MINE!\" and my niece (his cousin) has not gone through the same phase so when he snatches a toy from her we make him give it back, tell him to apologize, reassure her she doesn't need to give it to him if he doesn't ask nicely and then coach him to ask for it nicely. And yeah, we encourage sharing but we put away \"special\" toys before they hang out just to be safe. \n\nIt's a slow process. He's gonna get there.\n\nHe is also only 3 years old. And only just starting to understand sharing and being fair. Those boys were older, and if they do not have the capacity to understand sharing or playing nicely then the mother should have supervised them better. \n\nShe called you a bitch cause you were parenting better than her, lol.", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019re neither. But that woman is yes to both options.", "*her sons can play with that toy if they want to.* \n\n*My sister thinks it was wrong for me to take the toy back*\n\nNTA - who in the hell does this lady and your sister think they are?!?!  It's literally your daughters toys from home.  100% every right to dictate who gets to play with what and when it's time to put them away.  Those two adults and the little bratty boys can kick rocks.", "NTA wtf is wrong with people. She willingly allowed her 8/9 yo to bully a toddler. It sounds like there needs to be a larger police presence at your farmers market.", "NTA and good for you", "NTA\n\nBut she sure is and she's teaching her sons to be, too", "NTA-  steal toys, get chased\u2026 isn\u2019t that the way it works? Somebody had to do it.  I say that was a job well done.", "NTA  \n\n\ntheft is theft regardless of the age, hopefully those kids learn that lesson, instead of the parents who obviously let them get away with anything", "I applaud you for your composure. If I was forced to chase after someone *with a child in my arms*, grabbed and insulted by some woman, shit would have gone down. NTA", "NTA but the FB certainly is.  The sense of entitlement of people today boggles my mind.", "NTA while I can understand the other mom having a knee jerk reaction at first when you explained it she should of told her kids to give it back.  While toys are play things in the eyes of adults not all toys are created equal in the eyes of a kid. A child can have a toy that was given to them by someone they were close to who passed away or as a token of comfort when going through a touch time in their life. Toys like those are extremely important. Another kid running off with it and breaking the toy would break the heart of anyone especially to those younger than the the thief who can\u2019t keep up.\n\nIt is the equivalent of you seeing the woman\u2019s wedding ring and wearing it because it matched your outfit. That ring has valuable meaning to her and she alone gets to decide who wears it. If her spouse had passed away even more so.\n\nIt is one thing to teach kids to share when warranted but sharing isn\u2019t always a great idea. Kids have so little control and if they have a toy snack that is important to them sharing shouldn\u2019t be forced. \n\nThat mother expected her kids to get everything and is quite entitled.", "NTA.\n\nA good rule of thumb in a situation like this where someone is like \"it's just a toy, it doesn't matter\" is to replace it with something else in the story. \n\nIf the boys had grabbed your purse and run off with it, would you be justified in chasing them? Of course. It would be absurd for the mom to say \"They'll give your purse back when they're done with it.\" Because *they took something that didn't belong to them* and that's called stealing. The only place where it matters how much the item was worth is in court. It doesn't matter if it was a pacifier, a rare artwork, or anything else. It wasn't theirs.", "NTA those kids stole from your daughter and their parents wouldn't discipline them", "Absolute NTA. They were bullying your daughter and the mother was saying that it was ok for them to do it. The behavior was appalling.", "NTA, but the mom and your sister are. You told them not to bang the toys. Then they stole them.  You should have pressed charges against the mother for grabbing you. You can plainly see there is poor parenting there, and by the way, the mother acted!", "It\u2019s called stealing, eff that mom.", "NTA - people who steal get the stolen item removed from them - whether they are 3, 8, 13, 23 or 53. Age is irrelevant they don\u2019t get to steal from you - end of story.", "NTA. They weren\u2019t communal toys, they were your daughter\u2019s toys. They do not get to \u201ccontinue playing until they\u2019re done.\u201d They\u2019re done when you say they\u2019re done. She\u2019s probably mad cause she sent her awful kids to play somewhere else just to get away from her parenting failures and you chased them back with even MORE problems.", "Your sister was entirely wrong.\n\nThose boys get their entitled behaviour from their foul-mouthed, overly entitled mother.\n\nYou're NTA OP.", "NTA. And wth is wrong with your sister? She literally thinks the boys had a right to steal and keep your daughter's toy until they were ready to leave the market? I can't even with that shit. I'd have chased after the boys too for stealing my kids stuff. And, if their mother was paying attention instead of letting them wreak havoc unsupervised none of this would have happened. Tell your sister that no one has a right to steal your crap and give it back when they're done.", "NTA. You don't have to put up with that crap. She can go f all the way off.", "NTA.

Her children are thieves and should be punished as such.    \n\n\nYour sister is an idiot.", "NTA at all. That mom doesn't want to admit that her kids are so poorly behaved and she's taking it out on you.", "No NTA wtf is wrong with people??? My daughter is 4 still learning to share she's an only child and she is better about it now but in the past she has taken a toy from a kid and I immediately gave it back and explained to her you can't do that without permission. I don't understand why these parents can't teach their children boundaries. Especially with these boys being 8 and 9 they should definetly know better by now. She should have taught them that when they were first learning like i did with my daughter!", "NTA her sons are thieves. they took something that didn't belong to them and she was fine with that.

I would have taken it from their hands too , it's your property not theirs.\n\nDon't worry bout what that mother said.

They weren't playing, they were stealing and mum was trying to justify it.", "NTA and your sister is wrong. Those children stole from your daughter and took advantage of her.

Why not just leave your daughter with your husband?", "NTA\n\nThe audacity of her telling YOU how her kids can play with YOUR PROPERTY.\n\n\nWow", "NTA but I think it'd be easier to communicate the situation if you applied terminology to it. The 8/9 year old boys were bullying your child because their parents didn't raise them properly. If a parent does a terrible job, it's normal for society to try to correct that abnormal behavior. The boys were actually lucky that they only met you. If your daughter had an older sibling around their age, that sibling would be young enough and justified enough to potentially think that an altercation would be a reasonable response. They'd potentially think it was reasonable as defense from a bully.", "NTA, her kids were stealing.\n\nPretty sure if the situation was reversed, she would call the police and would ask for non-existing manager.", "Yikes!!!\n\nNTA\n\nNow ---- maybe it's time to get a better setup for your daughter.

Listen, I can understand the woman's initial upset ... seeing an adult chasing your kids can be scary! But you explained the situation to her and her reactions were just OTT entitled and terrible.

Her entitled boys are going to turn into entitled adults who don\u2019t respect any one and nothing will ever be their fault cause their mommy will always defend them.", "Nta. Who does she think she dictating if her kids can play with toys they stole from someone else.  Give them back, apologize, maybe be mortified the kids behaved in such a manner.", "NTA!!!\n\nSo she is raising her kids to be entitled brats who feel if they want something they can take it?\n\nIf I did that we would call it theft.\n\nShe is horrible and her children are as well.", "NTA.

I mean, at the age 8/9 they know what they are doing, so to just think they can get whatever they want won\u2019t work for them. Also, who is going to watch their back when they grow into adults? Their mommy? The kind these days are becoming selfish brats and this is their parent\u2019s fault, for letting them do whatever they want.

I've already taught my 4 yr old that isn't ok these boys should have been taught this awhile ago but obviously with the way their mother handled the situation we know why they think they can get away with it.

The parents handled it just fine, with a little sniping but no harm ultimately done aside from hurt feelings. Sending cops with guns to chase down a couple of kids for swiping a toy worth probably $5 would do nothing but increase resentment and fear of law enforcement.
