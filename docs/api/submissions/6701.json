It's honestly no different than saving their address or something.", "NTA\n\nMy husband likes to bake. I found out recently that he keeps a list of all his friends' favorite cookies. You know, so if he needs them to lend him a tool or help him move something or watch the dog for the weekend, he knows what to make them as a thank-you. He's apparently kept this list since he was a teenager. I thought it was adorable.", "Quite to the contrary of his thoughts, you keeping notes is actually very considerate and shows you care for your friends. You\u2019re allowed to keep whatever private notes you want on anybody or anything. Some people get weirded out but that\u2019s because of their own insecurities. NTA.", "NTA. It's actually really caring that you want to be careful to serve your guests what they like and what's safe for them.", "NTA. Not creepy at all. You're a considerate friend and your friend's position on this issue is bizarre.", "NTA Seems like projection. He probably is the nosy type who is up to no good and assume that everyone else who does any \"nosy\" behavior means they are up to no good.\n\nWhy do you think he scrolled all the way down to the note section when the phone number is all the way at the top of a contact?", "NTA, I think it's a very thoughtful gesture actually.", "NTA.\n\nShould add a new note after you delete the existing one: \u201cnot to be invited to dinner.\u201d", "NTA, you are being a thoughtful chef", "NTA.

Without context, I guess it's just a tiny bit eccentric. Still not really creepy or harmful, though. Also, these aren't notes on strangers. With context, though, it's incredibly sweet and considerate.

If he wasn't being creepy and snooping there's no way he would see the notes on your phone.  You have to scroll to see that part.  Lose his number and you'll be doing yourself a favor!  You are very considerate, and using a trick that many successful business people use.  That's WHY there's a section for notes.", "Absolutely NTA. I may be biased because I do the same thing and probably even to a greater extent (making notes about allergies, favorite & hated sweets/foods, even candles scents and colors), but my friend with a million and one food allergies actually really appreciates it and helps me update her note on my phone when she grows out of allergens. Sometimes my memory isn\u2019t the best, so I think taking notes can be helpful when picking out gifts or making food for people and making sure it\u2019s 1) safe for them to consume and 2) something that they\u2019d truly enjoy.\n\nThat being said, if your friend wants you to delete his info, you delete it.

It\u2019s not like you\u2019re obsessively counting how many times people go to the bathroom, or have a weird list of every person\u2019s shoe sizes.

NTA I am assuming you did not keep notes on how someone\u2019s ass looks in their jeans but on preference and medical to make your hosting events a success. Trade secret as a bartender I did that but used a memory technique. I no longer bartend so skill is lost \ud83d\ude20 so I am going to steal your idea. Plus you erased his info when asked. Another tip from a business owner I have files on my clients of things I have picked up to personalize their experience just never thought to do for my parties.", "YNA, I feel like you are a very organized person and take pride in your 'people pleasing skills'. I think it's awesome that you keep these \"little notes\" which may come in handy with, allergies and/or if someone wanted to throw someone a surprise birthday party you'd be able to help with the person knowing because you've had that person over... so while to some you might be wrong in such situations, I don't believe you are, and in time they will see that they are being petty and you just keep doing you....", "NTA.
