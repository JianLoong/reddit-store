He already told you who he is - someone who looks at the chest of teen girls - listen to him! It\u2019s not fair. I know that. It\u2019s absolute bullshit. But girl, you gotta protect yourself.", "NTA. But I would bring this up to your parents if I were you. You may be 15, but you're still a child and he is being gross. There is absolutely nothing wrong with what you were wearing, nor is there anything wrong with choosing not to wear a bra in general/public. It's your body, be comfortable.", "NTA\nI regularly do not wear a bra- I am 36. I have had a child. Both sexes have nipples. Deal. With. It.", "NTA. It\u2019s called freedom time. This is literally the first thing I do when I get home from work. And please, please, please watch out for that friend\u2019s dad. He\u2019s a giant red flag for caring that you were in comfy clothes in your own home. It\u2019s not like you answered the door naked, which wouldn\u2019t be recommended at any age (unless it\u2019s for a specific purpose).\n\nAs for your friends, teenagers are mean (not as mean as three year olds). I hated being one. While my friends and I never called people \u201cgay\u201d or \u201clesbo\u201d a lot of people did bc it was the early 2000s and it was the thing. And teens tend to suck. Don\u2019t let name calling weigh you down. The people doing it are garbage and will either evolve or remain garbage as adults. \n\nYou just keep living your best life and don\u2019t be a jerk to others. That\u2019s really the best life advice for anybody. \n\nAnd boobies should not be contained when I\u2019m the comfort of your own home. And \u201cproper\u201d pants are leg prisons.", "NTA, it's your home, not his. Do what makes you comfortable.", "And when you stop to think about it, women having to wear a bra, or needing to disguise the fact that they\u2019re *not* wearing a bra, is just weird. I throw on a hoodie too, but I shouldn\u2019t feel the need - or even a fear that anyone see me bra-less. It\u2019s weird that there\u2019s this obsession and at the same time aversion to breasts.\nAnd male nipples are okay, but female nipples must never be seen? I saw a comment on facebook that was something like \u201cgod forbid anyone see the outline of an undisguised breast!\u201d Society might collapse.", "None of mine fit anymore, I lost a lot of weight the hard way. Plus bras would be uncomfortable with my medi-port. I just wear tank tops and throw a looser (everything is loose, dammit) top or sweater over it if I have to leave the house. I even put pants on sometimes \ud83d\ude05", "40f, SAHM, homeschooling my 6yo. I make her get dressed for \u201cschool\u201d bc routine. But mom?  Pajamas all day if I can. Only boob jail if I have to leave the house or someone is coming over. \n\nNTA. Creepy dad though.", "I\u2019d make an anonymous report to CPS that her dad is looking at underage girls and making comments about their bodies and wondering what he might be doing at home. Ruin his credibility. But I\u2019m petty that way.", "I second this.\n\nYour parents really need to know.", "Why the *hell* would any of us choose to wear a bunch of skin-biting elastics and wires for a second longer than we have to? The moment I\u2019m inside and can manage it the bra is doffed. If it\u2019s my day off it never gets put on unless I\u2019m going somewhere middling nice, like out to lunch with friends, or dropping in on family. If I have to run to a store a bulky hoodie and a messenger bag is the perfect disguise.\n\nOver 50% of the population has them. Can they be sexual? Yeah, they can. Do they *have* to be? No. And it\u2019s really creepy that your friend\u2019s dad is behaving like this. \u201cModesty\u201d. No, that\u2019s just a code word for \u201cShame\u201d, because he reeks of being one of those wackadoo religious idiots who think women need to be controlled and fit into a perfect mold of womanhood. Dumb, obedient, submissive. To hell with that.", "I never wear them anymore, only when I work out and only for practical reasons not for modesty. Thankfully I\u2019ve never had shit off anyone! OP\u2019s friend\u2019s dad is a major creep, fixating on a child\u2019s chest. NTA", "Ooof. That's because it is weird. \n\nMy co-worker and I (both female) were recently having a discussion about skin issues as we are both pretty passionate about skincare. She mentioned something about a rash in her chest area. I asked her how often she washes her bra. Turns out she doesn't wear one. She was surprised that I didn't notice. I told her it's not something I pay a lot of attention to. You can see someone every day and not  check out their chest."]}
