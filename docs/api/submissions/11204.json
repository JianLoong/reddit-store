Now when Zach actually gets a win he\u2019ll be looking over his shoulder to see if it is real.  What a mess.", "YTA Of course you are. You just stomped all over Emmett to benefit Zach. Had the runner up been some other less-popular kid, would you have pressured Emmett to give up the role? What if some other popular kid had been ahead of Zach? Would you have asked them to sacrifice the part for your son?\n\nYou were so far out of line. Emmett will never, ever forget that Zach matters more to you.\n\nYou did, in fact, ask him to throw a fucking game.\n\nYou effed up.", "YTA Here's a fun idea: why don't you stop orchestrating your children's lives and just let them be who they want to be?", "YTA and holy shit the awful manipulation you pulled with \"a good brother would\" holy fuck. Do you do that often? That's horrendous and is absolutely going to cause either loads of problems in the future if not already. Jesus christ don't EVER do that, what is wrong with you?\n\nEdit: for the record, if Emmet had posted saying his parent did this and said \"a good brother would do this\" people would be warning him that this is an emotional abuse tactic and reassuring him that this is not true. Probably an encouragement to look into therapy.", "I want to add another side that I think is missing in the other YTA comments (that I all agree with) : You have one son who is very into science, and one who is into sports. As long as the sports fan isn't making it into a pro league (for which he'd likely already have to be in a special training, or league), which career track do you think will be more successful later in life? Yes, sports guys are more popular in high school, but things can quickly turn around later when science jobs are far better paid and have a much better career path.\n\nHaving an alternative to doing sports and getting recognition beyond being athletic could have been an important lesson to him now. It could have Shown Emmet he is capable of achieving success beyond being sportive. Now you took that away and he reverted back to his \"safe zone\", the sports.\n\nI think, going out of school, the roles of the popular or successful kid could turn around quickly and you just helped this a lot. You taught Emmet that he is only allowed to shine when it's about sports and that his only qualities are around his bodily capabilities. I really hope he makes it in sports so that my words are wrong, but you, OP, are a very short-sighted parent and did a bad job here.", "YTA. Emmett rightfully won that role so he shouldn\u2019t have to give it up! Zach will have more opportunities in the future to be able to get a role! Zach will be hurt when he finds out that you made his brother give the role up just so he can get it!", "YTA. Talk about favouritism. A \"good father\" would NEVER put his children in a position like this. If you keep this up, I wont be surprised if Emmett one day goes no contact with you.", "YTA. What in the High School Musical?\n\n\"A good brother would let him have this one thing.\"\n\nThe manipulation in this one line is astounding, you might as well audition for the villain role yourself.", "YTA - well done on killing any potential for Emmet to do well in life. \"Ooh must you always be ahead of your brother?\" That's how he sees it. You know, it's normal that some siblings are not at the same level as others. \n\n*ETA - seen comments mentioning emotional manipulation and it is true. Emmet, if you're reading this, leave and go no contact*", "YTA. Your son won the role in a Fair audition and deserves the spot. How could you even think that was a good decision? Yikes! Guaranteed way to drive a massive wedge between your sons and also mess up your relationship with them if they talk, which they likely will. Terrible parenting choice.", "YTA - \n\nHonestly this story sounds fabricated. \u201cZach gets all the attention and love\u201d you do realize that you\u2019re the parent right? you could teach your child not to compare himself to his brother.\n\nYou told your sons to do things out their comfort zone. They did that and you take away an opportunity for him ok.", "YTA. You are teaching both kids a horrible lesson, and not being fair to either one. The truth will come out. Which will make Zach feel like shit and even worse than second place. And embarrassed.", "Yep YTA\n\nYou shouldn't have asked Emmet to decline the role.  He auditioned and he won the role and it was something he wanted to do.\n\nYou just told Emmet exactly where he stands with you.  He doesn't matter as much as Zach.  Zach is your boy.\n\nMy child does the school plays.  It's a lot of work to audition, practice, learn.  Emmet put all that work in and you took it all away.\n\nAnd just FYI - kids talk.  Emmet won't tell Zach but someone else will.  How will Zach feel when he finds out that he didn't win the role and only got it because mummy stepped in?", "Congratulations, you\u2019ve managed to disappoint and insult both your kids. Just wait til Zach finds out.", "YTA. \n\nOP told Emmet he does not DESERVE his successes, OP told Zach he CANNOT earn his successes, and OP proved everything is about OP's issues.\n\nChildren learn where they are in ability and social strata through such things.  OP SHOULD have congratulated Emmet for the role, and Zach for trying out.  Noting, of course, that SUCCESSFUL people fail more than the average person even tries.  One role, tons of students, of COURSE most weren't going to get it.\n\nTruly VILE, OP.  Because ACTUALLY caring about the boys would involve helping Zach find where HE excels, not asking someone else - anyone else - to throw him a bone.  Really, BIG TIME YTA.

Think you can FIX that by asking SOMEONE ELSE to sacrifice?", ">It's not like I'm asking him to throw a fucking game.\n\nOnly if you hold sports on a pedestal mere theater can't touch.\n\nThis is LITERALLY telling Emmett to throw the fucking game.\n\nAnd when (not if) Zach finds out, he's not going to be filled with gratitude.\n\nYou may not have meant to be, but YTA.", "Your an ass; YTA\n\nThis has got to be fake. What parent sabotages one son's success and rationalizes it by guilt tripping the other son. There is nothing OK with this manipulative abusive action.", "YTA. It will come out that you interfered, then both of them will be mad. Do you really think Zach wants the role that way?  And if he was runner up for one lead, maybe he would have gotten a different major role.", "YTA. You asked your kids to step outside their comfort zone and both did. Then, you interfered after one of them got the part. You should be ashamed of yourself.", "YTA. Emmet will not keep this secret forever and when Zach finds out he will be *crushed*. You have engineered a system where neither of your children can trust you anymore. You betrayed them both.\n\nZach will always remember the time he thought he'd come first, only to find out that *you* interfered.\n\nEmmet will always remember the time you told him to give up on something you encouraged him to do for the sake of his brother.\n\nThey had their own lanes and with your encouragement they ended up pitted against each other. You're ruining their relationship with each other, too. You've failed them both, be honest and own up so you take the blame you deserve.", "YTA\n\nDO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU DID? \n\n>It's not like I'm asking him to throw a fucking game.\n\nNo, what you did was a step worse not only did you tell him to throw the game aka play. It was a play that you wanted him to do. You punished him for doing what you asked. And how did you punish him you ask!?\n\n> asked Emmet to decline the role so Zach could have his moment in the sun.\n\nThis leads to believing your mom loves your brother more than you. You need to do damage control quickly. I come from 2 families with 8 siblings in total. I have seen where it leads.\n\nYou have good intentions... but this road leads to hell.", "YTA. Why manipulate your sons to give Zach the lead role. Teenagers learn by theiri sucesses and failures and I am sure both of your kids will be fine without you meddling. Both of them have their strengths and weaknesses and your role should be to be encouraging them, praising them, and supporting of both of them. But by doing this you make Emmet feel like Zach is not good enough and what does that accomplish? Zach may be happy now but he will find out sooner or later and it will blow back on you. And even if he does not say anything, Emmet is probably upset that you encouraged him to do that. Congrats.", "YTA for asking Emmet to give up the lead role then being surprised he did what you said and doesn\u2019t want to do the play. He\u2019s still doing something new with track. Emmet sounds like an amazing brother not even telling his brother he was actually runner up. He\u2019s a good kid.", "YTA. You are teaching your sons the wrong lessons.", "YTA. It wasn't up to you to try to fix things. Not fair to either boy. It will come out that Zach wasn't the first pick and that will backfire on you.", "YTA.\n\nA good parent would never manipulate their child into declining an opportunity they earned fair and square just to give it to their other child. It's not like he was asking you to throw a fucking kid out.\n\nAlso, way to show your subtle disdain for Zach.

You need to fess up to Zach and apologize to both of them AND the teacher.\n\nEdit: yes, you did ask him to \u201cthrow a game\u201d but since you don\u2019t value Zach for his non-athletic skills, you just don\u2019t see it that way.", "YTA, and with that grade A emotional manipulation you're a shit parent as well. Get bent.", "Wow.  I'm sure years from now you may wonder why you have no relationship with Emmit and I hope Reddit reminds you exactly why.", "Why did you do that? YTA. You have potentially created a problem between the brothers. Why are you manipulating your children and trying to manipulate outcomes? Now you have a secret. Better think about how to handle it before it gets out.", "Yta\nYou're setting your children up to resent each other and resent you. \nStay out of it.", "Yta. I still hate my mom for not letting me go to my 7th grade dance\u2026. Because when my sister was in 7th grade she didn\u2019t go\u2026 because she didn\u2019t want to! \n\nThis was cruel and if Zack ever finds out he won\u2019t ever forgive you.", "Definitely YTA. He deserves to be pissed at you.", "YTA", "YTA. This is literally just life. Sometimes you give it your best and don\u2019t succeed. You, as a parent, need to be teaching your sons how to manage disappointments like this in a healthy way. Emmet shouldn\u2019t have to dampen his own light so that Zach can shine. They should both be able to shine in their own ways, and you should be giving them the tools necessary to navigate through disappointments. The real world does not care about personal circumstance. If you are the best candidate, you get the job offer. It\u2019s as simple as that, and your sons need to be prepared for that. No one in the real world is going to not take a job or not accept a role just to make the runner up candidate feel better. Set your sons up for success by helping them navigate these situations in a healthy manner.", "YTA- you basically told one kid they should give up something they are clearly good and might actually become passionate about just because you want the other one to feel special. With this logic, if one kid ends up accepted to an ivy league school, you may as well tell them they can't go because the other one might get their feelings hurt because they only got accepted into a state university. These kinds of decisions could potentially affect the rest of their lives and their relationship with you in the future.", "I'm sorry but this is disgusting.\n\nJust wait until Zach finds out he's a charity case.

What's the point? You only care about his brother, not him.", "YTA, honestly I feel bad for Emmet for having a parent like you. He got it cause he was better maybe?? Like he just gave it away. You need to do better parenting. You manipulated him, and then parents will be like \u201cwhy doesn\u2019t my son talk to me?\u201d Now you know why\nYou fucking said that you didn\u2019t ask him to give a fucking game well guess what you are a fucking bad parent. He got the role cause he was better he played fair and square. Fucking favouritism", "YTA\n\nYou're being unfair to both kids. Emmitt by forcing him give up something he wanted to do, and Zach by letting him think he won the part because his brother didn't want it. Emmitt is in pain now, Zach will be in pain when he finds out the truth.", "Yta.", "YTA.", "YTA, for sticking your nose in where it doesn\u2019t belong and unnecessarily creating strife between your sons.

When Zach finds out and he will, he is going to feel like he doesn't measure up because you intervened to get him the part. And he will resent you for that. All in all, you screwed this one up big time, I expect you are going to get raked over the coals, deservedly, here before you have to face the music from both of your sons.", "YTA", "YTA and you\u2019re going to completely ruin your relationship with Emmet by favoring Zach, and honestly you might even make Zach dislike you if he ever finds out about this.", "YTA", "YTA", "Yta omg what a horrible thing to do", "YTA\n\nThis is going to cause issues between the two of them AND neither of them are going to trust you after this.\n\nYou need to apologize to both of them, tell Zack the truth and try to make it up to Emmett somehow if it's even possible.", "YTA so you taught emmet if you try hard enough it will be taken from you in pity to your brother.

That\u2019s horrible.. your son wont forget or forgive you.. you sound like a nasty mom who definitely has a favorite. Your just horrible and it\u2019s so sad for Emmett who won that role fair and square.. I hope Emmett has other family member who will help him and back him up because his own mother is his enemy.", "Yta", "Yeah, YTA.", "YTA", "YTA you should be trying to lift Zach up, not bring Emmitt down. \n\nIf you are worried about Zach measuring himself against his brother, this was the absolute worst move to make. Zach needs to find his own spotlight, where he can achieve success on his own, or else learn to manage his expectations. This does neither and only reinforces his inferiority to his brother while also creating resentment.\n\nI have to wonder if Zach would even have wanted this if he knew the truth. Or have you just manipulated both of your kids into doing what you want instead of letting them make their own choices and learn from the experience.", "YTA.  You robbed both kids in one move. One of something that he legitimately earned, and the other of the feeling of having earned something legitmately. \n\nYou\u2019ve given Emmet a reason to resent his brother.  You\u2019ve given Zach a ticking time bomb of disappointment.  \n\nZach will eventually find out and all of your relationships are likely to suffer.", "YTA. I hate that you are a parent thinking about all the damage you have done, continue to do and will do in the future. Poor Emmett. Poor Zach.", "You don\u2019t build one kid up by asking the other to dampen his shine. Zach honestly handled this better than anyone could reasonably expect a teenager to. YTA.", "Yta\n\nYou tell your twins to get out of their comfort zone because they probably won't like School in their senior year. They do and the athlete becomes the actor, and then you say oh wait you should know that for your comfort zone go back to sports give it to your brother because obviously he's done as good as you but he needs to be the star. How many mixed messages can you put in one situation.\n\nYou are a lousy parent", "YTA big time, and did more harm than good for BOTH kids. Emmet will feel resentment towards his brother and you. This is a kind of story adults would tell when discussing shitty parenting they experienced. And when Zach eventually learn the truth - because one way or another, today or in ten years - he WILL learn the truth - he will know that his  achievement was not exactly real, and needed parent's intervention, and will have doubts about his other achievements as well.", "YTA and you should really learn to love Zach for who he is. I would be just as proud about Zach and his interest in science as I would be about Emmets sports achievements. You asking Emmet to step aside in favor of his brother, makes it extremely obviously how important publicity and positive distinguishing is for you, but it may not at all be that important for Zach.", "YTA - for all the obvious reasons already stated. \nI also have another take on it. You are making out like being the sports star is just the best thing ever. Science is awesome and a good career path. \u201cLet him have this one thing\u201d makes it sound like you think your own son is a loser cause he is not into sports or popular.

And Reddit knows it too. \n\nEmmet only agreed to drop out, because you would badger and nag him constantly if he did not. He only dropped it, because he doesn\u2019t want to be bothered with you pestering him.

Why couldn't you let Emmett have what he earned and speak to Zach to see if there was anything he would like tk try outaide school and try to encourage that?", "YTA how could you not be?", "YTA but gently because I know your intentions were good.\n\nI am a twin.  I was the Zach between my sister and me. My sister hit all of her developmental milestones before me.  Despite being identical in appearance, she still managed to be cuter/prettier than me because of how she carried herself (smiling more, better posture, etc.). I was clumsy and physically awkward; she was more graceful and not automatically relegated to the bench during PE.  We have similar intellects and my grades were always slightly better than hers, but she got chosen for advanced curriculum while I actually got assigned to remedial classes (which I was eventually rescued from, but still).  In high school, she was the better violin player. We both tried out for the academic team.  She got varsity while I was selected for the JV team.  She went all the way to calculus.  I stopped at trigonometry.\n\nFast forward to today. She has the most impressive job you can imagine.  Her salary is five times mine.  She is married with children.  I am single and have a cat.\n\nSo yeah.  I know how Zach may be feeling. And it sucks.  It sucks to feel like the \"inferior\" one all the time.  My self-esteem was abysmal for much of my life...even though I had had plenty of moments in the sun.\n\n\nLike, sure, I was plagued by being the \"dumb\" one and the \"ugly\" one.  But I was the one with the personality and the charm.  I was the artist and the comedian.  I wasn't as good as my sister with the violin, but I could play the violin AND the viola, while she could only play one. I got more scholarships than my sister. I made better grades than she did in college. We had a professor in college who would make a big deal over me being the best student in the class...which made my sister feel some kind of way since she was struggling in that class.  I had the higher GPA when we graduated. I had the higher GRE score too.\n\nAnd yet I had low self-esteem. Had it for thirty years (I am now 45). People would point out all of my achievements to cheer me up but they didn't matter.  Fortunately, with the help of a therapist, I was able to realize some meaningful accomplishments and my outlook changed.  I didn't start having accomplishments that were meaningful to me until I was in my 30s!  All the glory moments I had in high school meant nothing to me.\n\nAll of this to say that if Zach is anything like me, one moment in the sun isn't going to change how he views himself.  If he has low self-esteem, it isn't likely that getting to play Gaston will make everything better.  \n\nBut it is possible that Zach isn't anything like me and doesn't have low self-esteem.  You don't actually mention how Zach feels about anything.  Make sure you aren't projecting feelings onto him that he isn't feeling.  Like, maybe he doesn't want to be popular like his brother and he couldn't care less about being praised.  Not everyone wants to be \"big man on campus\".", "This is tough I get why you did what you did and I think it\u2019s commendable of you to want you son to break out his shell and feel accomplished. There are many dads who would cheer on the star athlete and forget the other kid . But this will cause a fight at some point , you edit says that only 2 people know but let\u2019s me honest your sons are brothers and will fight and this Will get thrown in someone\u2019s face. This reminds me of a saying \u201c the road to hell is paved with good intentions\u201d.", "YTA, so you are telling Emmet that he only is valued for his athletic ability and that Zach is not enough with his talents. And yes, Zach will find out eventually. Emmet will tell him when they have an argument one day between the 2 of them or when he is mad at you later on in life. Secrets like this don't stay secret forever and you are SO WRONG here", ">How is he going to find out\n\nYou are an idiot if you don't think that, at some point in the next few years, Zach is going to do something to piss Emmet off, and Emmet's response is going to be \"well the only reason you got to play Gaston is because Dad made me give you the role!\".  The Zach's confidence will crater, and it will be your fault.  Well done dad, well done. YTA", "As an identical twin you are absolutely YTA! To emotionally guilt and play one twin against the other is sooo sucky and you are absolutely reducing them down to one joint person rather than treating them as two completely separate people.\n\nYou are the worst of the worst when it comes to the way Twins are treated and I\u2019d go full NC with you if I was in Emmett\u2019s place. And you are their dad. You should be better than this.\n\nAlso if your boys are anything like my twin and I this won\u2019t be secret for long, if Zach doesn\u2019t already know he will soon. And how do you think that will make him feel? Like you don\u2019t think he is worthwhile or as good as his brother. This won\u2019t come down to him being second to the part. He will see this as you not thinking anything of him or that his Science isn\u2019t as worthwhile as Emmett\u2019s sports.\n\nStop reducing your sons down to who they are based on who the other one is. It\u2019s despicable and they will remember this for the rest of their lives. They deserve better than you and I\u2019m so sad that their own parent is such a manipulative dismissive jerk.", "Yta you made yr son give up something that was rightfully his. You used manipulation tactics and this will not only cause a wedge between you but between the boys.", "YTA \n\nTime will come when either you or his brother will piss off Emmet and he will tell the truth. I wonder how their mother will react", "What shitty parenting", "\u201cHow is he going to find out\u201d\n\nThere is an old saying: \u201ctwo people can keep a secret, but only if one of them is dead.\u201d\n\nThere will come a day when Zach and Emmet get in a fight, and Emmet will throw this in Zach\u2019s face. Emmet now has a perfect \u201cfuck you\u201d to throw at his brother, and I **promise** you he\u2019s going to eventually use it.", "YTA - you're going to have to help Zach deal with being different to Emmet\n\nThey can't both be equally charming or popular.  If Zach brings home a girl that Emmet likes, should he say 'Ohhh well its not fair that I have everything'.  If Zach gets a scholarship?\n\nJust because they are identical twins, doesn't mean you get to ensure they each have a much good luck and fortune as each other.  Are you going to compensate one who earns less? or expect the more successful brother pay his less successful twin on an annual basis?\n\nThe way life goes (as adults know), the person who is popular in HS fades in adulthood.  Chances are Emmet will do fine but knowing that you pitied him so much that you made Zach surrender this role to him will make him feel more pathetic than a teenager should feel.", "NTA - if you your mentioned it once and he did it. You would be if you pushed the issue.", "Oh, Zach already knows. I\u2019d place money on that. These boys have had 16 years to learn to tell Mommy Dearest only what she wants to hear.", "You're 100% right, VolcanicPale. People who think they know better usually don't. It's a lesson in humility because arrogance goes hand in hand with stupidity.", "Yeah OP just destroyed Zachs confidence.\n\nThe only time he \"won\" over his brother was only because their parent made it so. That will sour his happiness from the moment as well.\n\nOP also found a way how to turn both of their sons against them. Congratz!\n\nOP YTA.", "And this will come to light. No way Emmett will forever keep silent about this. And when that happens, both boys will resent you!", "With how fast the idea popped into her head, he must do it a lot. Must be automatic now.", "This! Loving the angry energy! OP got me so riled up", "I agree with all if this. Additionally, what if OP had let things play out without interfering and Zach joined track as a rebound instead and really pushed outside his comfort zone? Or found a different thing he was passionate about, like Choir or Art or Debate? \n\nOP, I think YTA because you stole the light from one child and took away opportunities from both.", "I hope Emmett  does have a career around sports and has access  to prime tickets----and never shares with dad.", "OP is going to come back one day asking why one (or both) of his sons refuses to talk to him anymore.", "This is a man?", "\"What in the high school musical?\" Best comment", "have they deleted all the comments? I can only see the one in reply to you about the phone", "And how will he pay for his cell phone?", "Last I checked, you don't get trophies or medals or letters for a high school play. So yes, sports is on top of the food chain in high school.", "As a parent a absolutely cannot see where op is coming from.  Insisting one child has to give up something they achieved for their sibling is piss poor parenting", "Your comment has been removed because it violates [Rule 1: Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

If anyone thinks for a second that we don\u2019t tell each other everything either immediately or pretty close to it they are wrong.\n\nAnd yes we will completely lie and tell others we haven\u2019t told the other one a thing. If your dumb enough to believe that I haven\u2019t shared everything with my twin that is on you.", "YTA.  They are identical twins, but you still have your \u201cgolden child\u201d.", "Even if it doesn't come out maliciously, the teacher could off handedly mention it. Or another person in the play.", "I just made an assumption, as it doesnt say.", "Nope, I can see them as far as I can tell, I meant comments on the whole topic", "Emmet is going to celebrate the day he never has to speak to you again.", "With the money he\u2019s saved from finding a really cheap nursing home one day.", "I'm seriously doubting how much the responses here matter to you. A stranger suggests your child leave, and your response is \"how will he pay for his phone?\" If I were a parent, I anticipate I'd be asking if I was so bad to deserve that and change my ways. Instead, you've just put a cherry on the cake, well played.", "Wow. You really don\u2019t like Emmett, do you?\n\nYou seem to resent him for being popular. Were you a \u201cZach\u201d back in high school yourself? You were wrong to treat Emmett so poorly.", "Holy cow, you really don't care about your kid's feelings *at* ***all***, do you?", "Main role can in school play can be quite important and can open just as much doors as being good at sports.", "I can't imagine doing this to my child.", "Or, worst case, it will come out in like 20 years at some random point like, \"Remember when we were teenagers and dad made me drop out of the play so you could have the lead? That was crazy.\" \n\nAll of the confidence the role helped build will instantly crumble, and Zach will spend weeks/ months/ years replaying everything in their life, trying to figure out if any of it mattered. Spiraling into a well of inadequacy and depression all because OP thought they knew better. OP YTA.", "I made the opposite lol. I\u2019m curious now.", "they aren't there anymore. the post and this one comment is but that's it", "I'm a public employee with an obese pension.", "Umm...no...But OP is surely an AH for doing this to his sons. He isn't doing anyone a favor and it will further create rift between the brothers", "My mom made me give things up for my sister all the time. It does happen and I never forgot it. My sister, bless her, realized how messed up it was as an adult and we\u2019re cool now.", "It's actually the family dog, Brian, posting.", "How odd, I've selected \"full discussion\" and they are there for me *confused*", "Who apparently doesn't give a shit whether your son cuts you out or not.  You're a shitty parent.", "I'm really glad y'all were able to do that. So many siblings end up estranged because of their parents actions", "Me, too. It was close there for awhile."]}
