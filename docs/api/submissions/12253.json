I know which side I would be on and it\u2019s the one that I can support with ease without having to lie.

To many people feel like they are competing with a ghost because their current partner never broke up with that person so they are always thinking 'if X was still alive would my partner still be with them and not me' and they just can't get over that so they do there best to erase the dead partner.\n\nThis seems to be quite common with step parent stories on here but it isn't just them. A couple of examples that come to mind were, one of a guy that came here because his at the time gf started freaking out about him visiting the grave of his dead childhood friend who he had a pretend engagement with and had about some mementos he had of her. Another was of a woman that started trying to one up the cooking of her bf's dead father because she became jealous of it (can't remember much more about this one)\n\nThe truth is we are all always going to lose when competing with a ghost because they are simply the memories people hold of a loved one covered in rose tinted glasses where we remember the good about them and gloss over the bad.", "[deleted]", "Yep.

I'd never met his mom, but I knew her name (I will use the fake name Heather, because of the movie) Heather. So I always hated that name because to me it stood for that person. So much that when I was choosing *my* child's name, I blacked it out with a sharpie in the baby names books!\n\nWell, when my kid was about 6 they got a new stuffed animal and named it \"Heather\" and carried it around everywhere and always talked to it and called it by name. So I have to say \"Go get Heather so we can get in the car!\"\n\nI was not thrilled at first, but even for a small child and a stuffie, it's not my choice!\n\nWell, eventually, because I said it all the time, \"Heather\" just became the name of the stuffie. And it makes me think of my child when they were small and sweet (no, they are not still sweet, teens are AHs, but they are pretty frickin cool instead).

I don't think your sister can even see the irony.", "NTA, Tell your sister you are being a good sister by telling her not what she wants to hear, but what she needs to hear.", "NTA, and would argue you are on her side trying to get her to accept how it will be. Step parenting is tough, but should never force yourself on them or to forget and replace their Mom", "The truth hurts! Nta", "NTA\n\nYou sound like a very caring and thoughtful person. Being supportive isn't just about blindly agreeing with someone, but sometimes pointed out their faults which may help them become a better person.\n\nI am not sure if the relationship between your sister and the Step kids is ruined, but it will only get worse of she doesn't change.", "You are absolutely NTA. Your sister has no one but herself to blame for her step-kids lack of love and respect for her.", "NTA, though you could be kinder.", "You are 100% NTA. You sister is the epitome of a wicked stepmother. Not one who is overly cruel or mean, but one that just doesn't understand that you can't MAKE children love you like a parent. I feel sorry for your sister, she is a petty, little person and will never truly be happy and it will ALWAYS be someone else's fault. Good for you for speaking up.", "NTA - you hurt her with the truth - and you didn't even get nasty to do it,  Sis made a tragic situation with a mom dying too young and a widower trying to keep it together all about her.  She needs therapy,  Sounds like the stepkids have caught on to that too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT - and the compassion should be for the kids and Nigel - Anything she lost was by her own actions", ">But then he started letting my sister push herself onto the kids and try to force out their maternal relatives.\n\nOut of what? Where?\n\n>It was very clear my sister blamed the maternal relatives for neither of her stepkids coming to think of her as their mom. She didn't want to hear any other reason it could be.\n\nYikes.\n\nHave you ever listened to the album Tallahassee by the Mountain Goats? Any time I hear of slow motion car wreck marriages I think of that album. Also St. Vincent's Marry Me album. Or Tolstoy. A lot of upper-middle class stories of wah wah woe is me but you won't love me exactly *how* I want you to, etc etc.\n\nI'm glad you felt like this was a place to let out some frustrations about your sister. I don't get it. I thought she knew what the kid's name was when she married the guy. Why is she getting upset....moreover at *you* about this *now*?\n\nNTA", "NTA. Your sister clearly has some egotistical and /or insecurity issues that are kind of off the charts. Her step son did nothing wrong. Neither did you. In fact you did her a favor by giving her a reality check....one she sadly chose to ignore.", "NTA\n\nFamily can absolutely be wrong.\n\nYou can expect family to support you and love you despite your being wrong, but that does not extend to telling you pretty lies to cover up that wrong.\n\n(To the contrary, you come to us covered in metaphorical shit, we clean you up get you some fresh clothes, put you back on your feet and laugh at you about it next Thanksgiving.)\n\nYou did your sister a favor by being honest with her.", "NTA.\n\n\"Oh no, not the consequences of my own (bad) actions!\"", "Very clearly NTA.", "NTA", "nta- first, she doesnt really have a reason to not like the bio mom because its not like she cheated on nigel and left the kids.. she passed away. she died loving all of them. so its only right for them to live, still loving her. i guarantee that Nigel even still loves his late wife because she left still loving him. she didnt do anything wrong so for your sister hate her and the love she had for her new family- its sick imo. if anything she should be grateful to the bio mom for giving her a beautiful family that your sister didnt have to work and pour her heart into in order to create. \n\ni also hope that Nigel has expressed that to her as well. loss is hard asf, especially with someone you created little people with. you see them in your kids. its not even fair to him for her to be acting like this because as i said, there's no reason for him to of stopped loving her. your sister needs to understand she isnt in competition with a dead woman, and if she would've taken it as an opportunity to help heal the family instead of trying to shove her way through, maybe they'd want to name their kids after her for being a decent person.", "NTA. She's SO WRONG that those children don't remember their mother, they absolutely do. My 5 year old remembers things that happened in his life, TOTALLY UNMEMORABLE STUFF when he was like 1.5 years old. Those kids remember their mother, and only a heartless fool would assume they wouldn't.", "NTA I didn't realize that being family meant always siding with and agreeing with them even when they're blatantly wrong. Your sister is an AH to be threatened by the dead mother of her stepkids. I couldn't imagine how bad it would've been if she'd been alive. Your sister needs to get over herself.", "NTA Your sister has been in the wrong for decades and this is just another example.  Sad that Nigel allowed her to push their maternal family away and let his kid to deal with her all these years.", "NTA, your sister is delusional.", "nta", "NTA. It\u2019s like a Disney movie where the kids have to deal with an evil step mom, but here Nigel doesn\u2019t realize it and doesn\u2019t leave her.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nMy mom passed away three years ago, and I don't think I *could* name my daughter after her. She was a beautiful woman and my best friend, having another \"Cindy\" in the house would feel wrong. I still love her, just find other ways to honor her.\n\nBesides, EXPECTING something like this? That's just a sure way to make sure they *don't* name their kid after you LOL", "NTA\n\n>She talked about how strange it was the kids, who didn't remember her, had her photo in their bedrooms, how her stepdaughter had a locket with a photo of her mom, dad and brother in it.   \n\nWhat a disgusting, vile creature.", "Nta, i love people who stand up to their family when they are wrong. Your sister needs therapy....if that'd even help.", "Your sister has been acting like the evil stepmoms of Reddit for years.  She\u2019s the only asshole here and deserved to hear what she heard.\n\nNTA and so is step-nephew.", "NTA. And how pathetic is it to be that jealous of a dead woman? That\u2019s the most disturbing part. Just because she is blood doesn\u2019t mean you have to cater to her ridiculous ideas. She didn\u2019t birth those kids and by the sounds of it, she was less than supportive in helping them keep their mothers memory alive. I heard you can name bugs at a zoo after someone you don\u2019t like and they will feed it to an animal. So if she REALLY thinks that she deserves to have her name passed on, there\u2019s an option!", "NTA. Beautifully said. Ask her why you would be on her side when she's clearly in the wrong?", "NTA - in fact, good for you! I wouldn't want her as a step mum but you sound like you'd be a cool aunt to have in your corner. Your sister sounds like she is making everything about her, including step son's first child, which is weird.", "NTA. Why hasn\u2019t Nigel left her yet? Ugh!", "NTA", "NTA by a thousand\n\nYour sister is, frankly, awful and selfish, and I feel really sorry those children had to live with a cliche stepmother; it's no wonder they want nothing to do with her.\n\nI'd tell her to go watch *Cinderella* for some long-overdue lessons on how **not** to have been, and then tell her all whining about the stepkids is done and you're not gonna listen to it any longer.", "Yeah. NTA. Your sister is TA. And quite a narcissistic one at that. She is not their mother and never will be, and honestly if that's how she's behaved for the last 21 years no wonder her step son feels that way about her. The only person being disrespectful is your sister.", "NTA in my opinion her actions were emotionally abusive and her husband failed those kids in keeping her around at all.", "Funny how she wants unquestioned support from you because you're blood relatives but seems unable to respect the love for a lost mother. She is unhinged.", "NTA. You can't \"replace\" someone. Why is that so hard for some people to understand? She's just mad at the truth.", " NTA. Your sister really needs to get over herself.", "NTA! We just buried my husband's step-mom yesterday. She married his dad when he was 7. She went from a single woman to step-mom to 5 kids. She never tried to erase their mom from their lives and had photos of their mom on the walls. Shame on your sister for her actions as a step-mom.", "Agreed. I have a stepgrandmother and she is my grandmother but not my moms mother. In the house of my grandfather and her there is and always have been a picture of my biological grandmother who passed away too soon, when she was only 49 and my mother was around 20 years old.\n\nAnd now I am a stepmom myself. I have a stepson and I love him very dearly. I love and treat him like he is one of my biological children and would never treat him different than my other biological son (they are half brothers). But I am never going to replace his mother (who is still alive and coparenting with my partner). He has a mom and to him she will be the only mom he has (rightfully so). It is so important that you don\u2019t try to compete as a stepparent. Because you will lose it. Besides a child can love more people than just 2. I try to be the best person I can be for my stepson and just hope he will keep loving me. That is the only advice I can give other stepparents.", "I am amazed at Step-Mom's contradictory thought processes.\n\n1. I'm the mom now, you need to forget your biological maternal family.\n2. How dare you not support me, I am your sister.  You're supposed to always support your family.\n\nOP is NTA and step-mom is not connected to reality.", ">Someone needed to give her a reality check\n\nI doubt this will work, given it's been 23 years already lol", "Your step kids are lucky!\n\nSometimes people are so transactional - if I treat you as my child then you must accept me as your parent. And sometimes it is even worse - I will treat you as a burden, but you must still respect me as a parent.\n\nWhen in actuality, the only thing you should do is put in the hard work to show them that you care and hope that the relationship develops into a loving one.", "Yes, the irony is RICH!", "Does he though? Imagine letting your kids around this person. There was just another AITA post about another dude letting the stepmom doing that, to the point of him possibly throwing out the scrapbook the kids from the first marriage made to memorialize their mom.", ">In the Jewish religion we don\u2019t name people after living people\n\nIn Italian-American families, we have a bank of 5 names per gender, and we name everyone the same. It also prevents hurt feelings!\n\n(I am joking, but sometimes it feels like this!)", "It's all ME ME ME ME ME (sister).  \nNever about them, or us.   \n(Us, but ME first).  \nNTA", "This is why I\u2019m so afraid of dying because no matter how much my husband loves me and my child I feel he won\u2019t do right by my child after I\u2019m gone. It\u2019s so sad the step kids had to endure that.", "I think for many fear of being alone is what keeps them. Yes I think nigel is weak af to be acting like this. Being alone is actually a strength.", "Show her this post and tell her she needs to hang out on this sub a bit more to see the daily posts about how most kids feel about their stepparents. Hopefully that will give her the major awakening she needs. \n\nHowever, since she's been carrying her jealousy for so long, I doubt there's hope for her. \n\nJust comes to show how jealousy will literally rot a person and lead to ruin in a relationship.\n\nNTA", "I was gonna ask about the plushie because I\u2019m THAT kind of guy. Glad to hear you still have it!", "NTA \n\nYour sister needed a proper reality check! She deserved every word from both her step son and you! This woman is ridiculous!", "I remember when reading about Henry VIII how he exalted Jane Seymour as his favorite and none of his wives after her could match up. But it doesnt sound like the husband was doing this.", "I obviously don't agree with OP's sister's toxic and malicious jealousy, but I think the point of that sentiment is that the dead woman is impossible to compete with because, in death, she becomes perfect to her widower, like an idol. She can't do anything wrong; she can't hurt him; they can't fall out of love. To him, his dead wife will always be perfect, but any new partner, as a living and breathing person, can't ever be.", "Do the older kids have a relationship with their maternal family again now that they\u2019re adults?", "Yeah, totally weird ;)", ">In Italian-American families, we have a bank of 5 names per gender   \n\n\nJoey, Frankie, Tony, Vincent, and Sal?\n\nMy cousin's side of the family are Italian from Staten Island and those are basically their names.", "Her argument is similar to many strange posts on AITA, where OP is farther away on the family tree than the perpetrator, and gets dogpiled by aunts, uncles, absolutely anyone who thinks that \"supporting\" the one creating issues is more important than pointing out the obvious or staying out of it. \n\nIf going by OP's sister's logic, one can't be deemed to be in the wrong, if the one seeing and the one doing are blood-relatives and the victim is not.", "There you go, using FACTS and LOGIC again... \n\n;-)", "I'm sorry he stayed married to your sister through all that and didn't kick her to the curb", "I\u2019ve read a post where the OP was given sentimental items to hold onto for their niece and nephew because OP\u2019s sister was dying and worried that her husband would remarry and try to erase her presence.

The husband remarried and demanded the sentimental items to give to his new step kids because it wasn\u2019t \u201cfair\u201d that his kids had special items and they didn\u2019t.", "Sad, but you have time to prepare.\n\nMake sure ANYTHING you have set aside for your child(ren) is in a trust and husband is NOT the trustee.
