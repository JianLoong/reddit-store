You kind of have to decide if you are on the side of reason or the side of imaginary blood ties that some people fantasize are unbreakable in a moral sense (usually when they are desperate for support and can\u2019t get it because they also are 1st class AHs).  I know which side I would be on and it\u2019s the one that I can support with ease without having to lie.  She is even an AH trying to manipulate you into defending her AH behavior by suggesting you\u2019d be an AH not to by breaking some moral code.  What an AH!", "NTA you have a shitty sister who doesn't seem to get it. Step moms need to find their place in a family and trying to erase a mom's place from a child's heart and life is not the way.

Shes just a spare who is trying to squeeze in and being miserable at it.", "NTA I think you sister like a lot of people are was never mentally or emotionally mature enough to be in a relationship with someone with a dead partner let alone one that involves children. To many people feel like they are competing with a ghost because their current partner never broke up with that person so they are always thinking 'if X was still alive would my partner still be with them and not me' and they just can't get over that so they do there best to erase the dead partner.\n\nThis seems to be quite common with step parent stories on here but it isn't just them. A couple of examples that come to mind were, one of a guy that came here because his at the time gf started freaking out about him visiting the grave of his dead childhood friend who he had a pretend engagement with and had about some mementos he had of her. Another was of a woman that started trying to one up the cooking of her bf's dead father because she became jealous of it (can't remember much more about this one)\n\nThe truth is we are all always going to lose when competing with a ghost because they are simply the memories people hold of a loved one covered in rose tinted glasses where we remember the good about them and gloss over the bad.", "So he beamed the daughter with the name of a person he hates? Wow ballsy. I hope he just say it cause he was hurt in the moment and could find a peaceful resolution. \nI think this family should have done some therapy. Which wasn\u2019t so much talk about years ago. NTA at all, I am sure your sister could have found a healthier way to become a mother to those kids without not validating their live for their biological mother. Not saying it\u2019s easy, but possible. But in all those years have you ever sit down your sister and in a peaceful way try to make her see reason?", "Yep.

Had she come into the family understanding how much they loved their mom who died and been supportive and loving towards all of the family, she'd have gained a few new family members.

Honestly, I'd be beyond shocked and incredibly honored if one of my kids chose and part of my name for one of their kids. \n\nIt wasn't a kind thing, what you said, but I totally think your sister walked right into it. She was deserving of every word. It was something she needed to hear. It's clear that she isn't going to change her toxic  behavior any time soon. I guess it hasn't cost her enough.

(And some people might say the phrasing with gfy is wrong, here, but I don't think words are bad in and of themselves... it's how and when they are used, and here was appropriate!)\n\nYour sister was wrong for venting to you repeatedly about this without your consent.\n\nShe was wrong for stating that you must be on her side because of the relationship... for 3 reasons: 1) because it shows her value of blood relationships is based in hypocrisy and 2) because when you open a conversation with someone you have no right to control their replies! 3) a person should be on the side of who they think is right.... and **most** importantly, 4) There should be no sides. This is the stepson's child. No one but the stepson and his partner *have* a side.\n\nIn light of all of that... you were stating your opinion about a situation she was forcing into the conversation... defending the person who was in the right... addressing the issue (lack of respect) directly....\n\nSuper clear NTA\n\nI guess, if I *had* to say something you did that was *wrong*, I couldn't, but if forced to nitpick something that could have gone better... *Maybe*? Depending on the phrasing, the \"if I was your stepkid\" part could seem like an attack on her, rather than the behavior? But I don't think it was, really.\n\nLike ...

So he surprised me by inviting my 2 best friends and taking 3 13 year olds! I decided to do junior miss so there was a pageant I participated in and we had to build a float to ride through parades. My stepdad is an electrician and he put SOOOO many hours into making the stage and the float absolutely perfect! He hates wearing suits but he wore one to escort me in the pageant and made me laugh so I wasn't as nervous.

But it doesn't matter what anybody says to OPs sister or how many reality checks OP tries to give her. She will NEVER accept any blame for this. OP tried from the beginning to get the sister to stop being an ass about the mom and it didn't work. I would say it will take the step kids going no contact with her to be \"the reality check\" but honestly I bet she'll just keep blaming the moms family. Totally sucky situation but OP is NTA for trying to smack sense into the sister for being an overbearing and jealous stepmom", "> Even if she was their birth mother, she would have no right to expect them to name their child after her. \n\nThis is one of my pet peeves.\n\nWhen I was a teenager I used to babysit for a boy whose mother had been very abusive. So he lived with his father. He was 2 and he had no baby teeth left because they were rotted out, and he walked funny because his legs had been broken several times in falls.  It was really sad. I'd never met his mom, but I knew her name (I will use the fake name Heather, because of the movie) Heather. So I always hated that name because to me it stood for that person. So much that when I was choosing *my* child's name, I blacked it out with a sharpie in the baby names books!\n\nWell, when my kid was about 6 they got a new stuffed animal and named it \"Heather\" and carried it around everywhere and always talked to it and called it by name. So I have to say \"Go get Heather so we can get in the car!\"\n\nI was not thrilled at first, but even for a small child and a stuffie, it's not my choice!\n\nWell, eventually, because I said it all the time, \"Heather\" just became the name of the stuffie. And it makes me think of my child when they were small and sweet (no, they are not still sweet, teens are AHs, but they are pretty frickin cool instead). Anyway... it becomes a pleasant memory instead, if you let it. \n\nIf you try to control what choices your children make instead, you only end up bitter!\n\n(Yes, we still have Heather, but she sits on a shelf, for any who were concerned!)", ">She's dead, she can't \"win\". \n\nRight! I saw a movie not long ago where the MC was in love with a man whose wife had died. And she says \"How am I supposed to compete with a dead woman?!\"\n\nFirst of all, why do you need to compete?! Second, it should be easy... she's dead, she can't fight back!!", ">I won them over with honesty and respect and I love them to pieces\n\nThere are always sooooo many stepparent/stepkid stories on here, and almost always, the stepparents who love the kids and don't force a relationship and help them remember/respect *both* bio-parents end up being the ones the kids think of as parents. While everyone who tries to compete/force the issue ends up with a bad relationship with them. \n\nCrazy how life do that, huh? :P", "They might not think of her as a Mom but they definitely would have had a better relationship.  Sometimes it happens and sometimes it doesn\u2019t but if stepparents are just supportive and not pushy then the kids will have a better relationship with them.", "Her argument that you should be on her side because she is your sister.
