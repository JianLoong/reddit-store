I know which side I would be on and it\u2019s the one that I can support with ease without having to lie.

To many people feel like they are competing with a ghost because their current partner never broke up with that person so they are always thinking 'if X was still alive would my partner still be with them and not me' and they just can't get over that so they do there best to erase the dead partner.\n\nThis seems to be quite common with step parent stories on here but it isn't just them. A couple of examples that come to mind were, one of a guy that came here because his at the time gf started freaking out about him visiting the grave of his dead childhood friend who he had a pretend engagement with and had about some mementos he had of her. Another was of a woman that started trying to one up the cooking of her bf's dead father because she became jealous of it (can't remember much more about this one)\n\nThe truth is we are all always going to lose when competing with a ghost because they are simply the memories people hold of a loved one covered in rose tinted glasses where we remember the good about them and gloss over the bad.", "[deleted]", "Yep.

I'd never met his mom, but I knew her name (I will use the fake name Heather, because of the movie) Heather. So I always hated that name because to me it stood for that person. So much that when I was choosing *my* child's name, I blacked it out with a sharpie in the baby names books!\n\nWell, when my kid was about 6 they got a new stuffed animal and named it \"Heather\" and carried it around everywhere and always talked to it and called it by name. So I have to say \"Go get Heather so we can get in the car!\"\n\nI was not thrilled at first, but even for a small child and a stuffie, it's not my choice!\n\nWell, eventually, because I said it all the time, \"Heather\" just became the name of the stuffie. And it makes me think of my child when they were small and sweet (no, they are not still sweet, teens are AHs, but they are pretty frickin cool instead). Anyway... it becomes a pleasant memory instead, if you let it. \n\nIf you try to control what choices your children make instead, you only end up bitter!\n\n(Yes, we still have Heather, but she sits on a shelf, for any who were concerned!)", ">She's dead, she can't \"win\". \n\nRight!

Almost as if Catholics like saints' names.  \ud83e\udd14", "One time I was flying international and got upgraded to business class. The flight attendant has a roster of passengers and came around to get our dinner orders. \"Hello Ms \\_\\_\\_\\_ would you prefer the chicken or the pasta?\"\n\nShe asked the guy sitting across the aisle from me for his meal preference, Then asked if he knew if his wife (who was in the window seat and appeared to be sleeping) would want dinner. Her eyes immediately popped open and she said in a horrified voice \"that's my dad!\"", "I read that one too and it made me see RED. how can people justify such awful behavior and entitlement? I will never even want to understand that sort of one-sided mentality.", "Do you or anyone have the link to that post by chance?", "I remember that one and it made my blood boil. OPs BIL going on about \"it's not fair\" that his *own kids* get sentimental items from *their own deceased mother* but his stepkids who are no relation to his late wife whatsoever doesn't, that's \"not fair\" is it? \n\nWell was it \"fair\" that his kid lost their mum so young? Or was it fair that his dying first wife had to give the sentimental items to her sibling because her husband did *exactly what she feared he'd do* and put his new family before their children?\n\nIf his stepkids want special, sentimental items then they can have them from their own parents, plus I'm sure OPs nibblings would rather have their mum alive and well so she could pass the items on to them herself when she planned to."]}
