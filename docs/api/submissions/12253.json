From the very early days it was clear she was toxically jealous of Nigel's late wife and the kids mom. She talked about how strange it was the kids, who didn't remember her, had her photo in their bedrooms, how her stepdaughter had a locket with a photo of her mom, dad and brother in it. I remember back then asking how it was strange. Her mom was loved and Nigel and his late wife's family likely didn't want the kids to not know they were loved by their mom. She said that was her job now. I told her it wasn't healthy to feel that jealous and put out over a mom being remembered. Think of how she would feel if our mom died.\n\nHonestly, I had a lot of respect for Nigel for the first two or three years because his kids seemed to be his priority and he seemed to still love and care about his late wife and not want to erase her but was also ready to be married to someone else. I had seen a lot of far more awful scenarios. But then he started letting my sister push herself onto the kids and try to force out their maternal relatives.

His daughter is named after both her grandmother's. But his mom's name is her first name. My sister was so unhappy about that. She told him it was disrespectful to her and all that crap. He told her to go fuck herself and told her she still hadn't figured out that she wasn't his mom, she wasn't his parent, she wasn't even his real family, because he would happily dump her out of his life for good and would never feel bad about that.\n\nMy sister bitched for weeks about it and then I told her if I was her stepkid, I'd do the same. That she had no respect for his mom and had no respect for his maternal family. She freaked out and told me that was a shitty thing to say and I should be on HER side, because she's my SISTER. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1678786915, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11r1tl9/aita_for_telling_my_sister_if_she_was_my_stepmom/", "score": 42, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If I am, they will tell me so.  That is what good friends do.

As a parent you should always keep your kids first, I really feel bad for them.", "NTA. It's just a very sad situation all round. Your sister's sense of entitleent and jealousy are twisted personailty traits and it's awful it has negatively affected Nigel as well as his older children.", "NTA.", "NTA-  The problem with being on her side for the reason that she is your sister is that it\u2019s complicated by the fact that she is also a first class AH.  You kind of have to decide if you are on the side of reason or the side of imaginary blood ties that some people fantasize are unbreakable in a moral sense (usually when they are desperate for support and can\u2019t get it because they also are 1st class AHs).  I know which side I would be on and it\u2019s the one that I can support with ease without having to lie.  She is even an AH trying to manipulate you into defending her AH behavior by suggesting you\u2019d be an AH not to by breaking some moral code.  What an AH!", "NTA you have a shitty sister who doesn't seem to get it. Step moms need to find their place in a family and trying to erase a mom's place from a child's heart and life is not the way. Else someday they will be asked to step aside and forgotten. The kids have every right to honor their late mom and grandma and with the behavior your sister has shown, its no surprise they didn't even want her to be any part of their life. Shes just a spare who is trying to squeeze in and being miserable at it.", "NTA I think you sister like a lot of people are was never mentally or emotionally mature enough to be in a relationship with someone with a dead partner let alone one that involves children. To many people feel like they are competing with a ghost because their current partner never broke up with that person so they are always thinking 'if X was still alive would my partner still be with them and not me' and they just can't get over that so they do there best to erase the dead partner.\n\nThis seems to be quite common with step parent stories on here but it isn't just them. A couple of examples that come to mind were, one of a guy that came here because his at the time gf started freaking out about him visiting the grave of his dead childhood friend who he had a pretend engagement with and had about some mementos he had of her. Another was of a woman that started trying to one up the cooking of her bf's dead father because she became jealous of it (can't remember much more about this one)\n\nThe truth is we are all always going to lose when competing with a ghost because they are simply the memories people hold of a loved one covered in rose tinted glasses where we remember the good about them and gloss over the bad.", "So he beamed the daughter with the name of a person he hates? Wow ballsy. I hope he just say it cause he was hurt in the moment and could find a peaceful resolution. \nI think this family should have done some therapy. Which wasn\u2019t so much talk about years ago. NTA at all, I am sure your sister could have found a healthier way to become a mother to those kids without not validating their live for their biological mother. Not saying it\u2019s easy, but possible. But in all those years have you ever sit down your sister and in a peaceful way try to make her see reason?", "Yep. Sad thing is she and Nigel have kids and those kids will miss out too because of how she has treated Nigel's older kids. But he let's her treat them that way and stayed with someone so bitterly jealous of his late wife. I'll never understand after that.", "Same. I can't believe how much he was willing to let happen and he ended up ruining his relationship with his older kids.", "She never really tried to hide it from the kids. At first she hid it from Nigel but then he started just letting her do the crap and didn't put his kids first and then it never had to be held back. Despite that she thought the kids would love her.", "Honestly, for all the relationship that's left, I'm shocked too.", "The stepson named his daughter after his late mother (not stepmother) and middle name was his wife's mother's name.", "He named his daughter after his mom. He loves his mom. It's my sister who hates the memory of her and yes, I have tried to sit down calmly and help her see reason.", "You are definitely not the ass- your sister though W H E W", "Sadly far too many people prioritise their partner over their children"]}
