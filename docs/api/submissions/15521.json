This friend and I were besties since high school and I'm incredibly grateful for her friendship. It was a destination wedding that took place in Italy. My friend had initially asked me to be a bridesmaid but I had to turn it down because most of the wedding planning and other important events were going to be in Italy and because I'm a resident doctor, I wouldn't be able to make the commitment. My friend added me to a group chat of her and her bridesmaids though so I could see the updates and join in for any event that I was free for. I still didn't think it would be nice for me to just go without having put in any of what should've been my share of responsibilities so I never went for any of the events.\n\nWhen my friend sent the invites she mentioned a dress code for us guests. It was \"Full black, anything but dresses for women and full black business casual for men\"\n\nThe only wedding appropriate outfit I had was straight leg full length satin pants and a leather corset top. I asked my friend (along with a picture of the fit) if it was ok to wear that and if she felt uncomfortable with it, I'd get something else immediately. My friend said \"It looks gorg and quite frankly m/n I couldn't care less if you turned up butt naked as long as you came to the wedding. Please don't fret about the outfit too much. I miss you and just really wish for you to be there.\" I got the bride's approval so that is what I wore to the wedding. My husband wore a turtleneck, blazer and jeans (all black). The wedding went beautifully, and my friend and I reconnected after a long time and all I felt was happiness for her and how much I was going to miss her.\n\nThen out of the blue, one cousin of the bride (26?M) came to me and said that my outfit was inappropriate and that I was ruining the wedding. One of the bridesmaids came and in a very huffy tone agreed with him. I explained to them that I had gotten the bride's approval so I didn't see the problem and that there were other women dressed in dresses which broke the dress code so I didn't see why they were only coming for me. They replied with a \"yeah but the bride is spending more time with you than them so you're really ruining it with your attention whore outfit. All the wedding photos are going to look so out of place because of you\". My husband tried defending me but they were adamant on blaming me so I just borrowed my husband's blazer and wore it for the rest of the evening. It didn't feel right to ask the bride about this so I just left it but I need to know if I'm TA.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdits: I'm not from the US. I joined medical school straight out of high school at 17 y/o and finished 4.5 years of med school and I'm now on my last year of the 5.5 year course which is the internship year+ rural service period (which is an additional 2 years since the college I attend mandates it because of their service oriented mission). Since in America, the period of training right after med school is called residency I though it was the same as this internship period.\n\nAbout the dress code, just to clarify, it said and I quote \"Anything but dresses for women\" so dresses were the only no but everyone's clothes had to be full black.\n\nI think my wording confused some of y'all. I think a better word for what I wore was \"bustier corset top\"?\n\nApologies for the confusion!", "created_utc": 1682278469, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12wn9fq/aita_for_ruining_my_friends_wedding_by_wearing_a/", "score": 939, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Did you find one that was sold as outerwear, or did you just wear underwear as a top? Corsettes are so rare now that most people likely didn't even realize it's meant to be underwear, since it covers most of the torso. But I can imagine women who are aware corsets are 99% of the time meant to be sexy underwear might raise their eyebrows at it. It wasn't right for them to confront you about it, though. And I don't think a guest's outfit can really ruin a wedding. At my wedding, someone brought a +1 who came in dressed entirely as Deadpool, mask and everything. It was bizarre and funny, but it certainly didn't ruin the wedding. And I imagine a Deadpool costume would be way more noticeable to other guests than a corset used as a top, especially since most people don't know enough about corsets to realize it's usually underwear and corsets cover a lot more than typical underwear does.
