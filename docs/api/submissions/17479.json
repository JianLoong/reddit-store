Especially family and friends bc it just tears relationships apart. \n\nso anyway NTA, but you need to draw some stronger boundaries here. I'm not sure how you expect him to pay when he doesn't have a job, so that seems unrealistic. But you can give him a list of chores you expect him to do daily/weekly/whatevs, or he can get out and find somewhere else to crash (with a reasonable timeline to find an alternative - two weeks? a month?). \n\nand then you stick to that & kick him out if he doesn't comply. get your husband or friends to help you if you need.  You have to mean it or you have 0 leverage for him to start giving a shit. \n\nalso check with a lawyer if you can, or look up your state/city's laws around this type of situation. its challenging when you don't have a contract to refer to but it might help that he's not on the lease/mortgage, if this escalates and you need to get police or law involved.", "NTA\n\nHe moved in to \u201chelp out\u201d but how is he helping?

NTA.", "Hi!  I\u2019m sorry to hear this.  I\u2019m going through something similar with my Uncle at the moment.  I recommend talking this through with your husband and committing to a plan and then sitting him down and talking to him with your husband present.  How I\u2019m handling this is to tell my uncle he needs to 1) contribute to bills, 2) help around the house, and 3) contribute to his future.\n\n1) Bills.  Since it sounds like it\u2019s you, your husband, your two kids, and your brother I\u2019d suggest having him pay 1/4 of each bill (mortgage included.  These bills are his rent).  If you \n\n2) Chores.  If you\u2019re cooking every meal, he should be expected to do (or help with) the dishes.  Clean his own spaces regularly and help with communal spaces as well.\n\n3) Contribute to his future.  With my uncle, the condition of him staying with me is that he needs to prepare for his future.  He needs to put money into a savings that he doesn\u2019t touch, get a job, and make a plan for himself.  I sit him down biweekly (aka payday) to talk about his budget and future plans.  How much was he able to save this pay period?  How\u2019s work going?  Occasionally I\u2019ll check in on his long term plans, but not every other week.\n\nThis is hard.  My uncle threatened to kill himself when I told him I needed to set these boundaries and then drove across the country to \u201cget away from my toxic environment.\u201d  I got a call weeks later from him after he wound up homeless and without a phone, money, or gas in a Walmart in Louisiana.  It\u2019s not a toxic environment, I just have expectations if you\u2019re going to live with me.  You\u2019re more than welcome to move out if you don\u2019t want to meet my expectations.  You need to contribute via labor and finance to the household and you need to work on your own future.  Good luck though.  It\u2019s a lot easier when you have a partner to back you up and be there for these conversations, which is why I suggest you getting on the same page with him prior to this conversation.  Maybe assign roles too.  For example, you lead the conversation and he will focus on keeping everyone on track.\n\nAgain, good luck.", "NTA\u2026gee, I wonder why mom does not want your brother home with her?  Not only should he pay rent, he should also be helping out around the house.  Just because he would pay rent does not excuse him from house chores.  He starts paying rent, helps out around the house or he has thirty days to find new digs.", "NTA. Not only should you require rent, you should still require him to clean his room and bathroom and any messes he makes as well as sharing in the chores that need to be done. Does he eat your food? If so he should contribute for food and the cleaning of dishes. NOT requiring him to do these things is actually detrimental to you, your family and in the end its better for your brother as the real world wont allow his shit.", "NTA\n\nHe is not your dependent, he is a grown adult.  For a grown adult to refuse to contribute?  He can pay rent.  To someone else.\n\nJust tell him to move out", "NTA - Your not running a hotel. He should be expected to help out in some capacity and if he isnt willing to do that then he can find somewhere else to live. He isnt your responsibilty. Nor is he your mother's.

It\u2019s probably best just to have him move out though.", "You also need him to agree to get help for his depression and that if he doesn\u2019t do his part he will move out within a 2 week period. \nPs I don\u2019t believe whatever boundaries you set he will follow bc of his past behaviors- be prepared to send him back to mom and don\u2019t apologize for it either", "If you really need help with the rent, then no, NTA, but if you don\u2019t and would just be profitting from your brother living there, then yes that is a bit of a dick move and more importantly I don\u2019t think would resolve the issue at hand. How would you enforce him paying rent if you can\u2019t even enforce him taking out the trash? That being said, he is also being an asshole for not holding up his end of the deal, and the dynamic of the whole situation has become confused. It seems that your brother is the one who actually needs help, but rather than directly ask for help he\u2019s moved in under the false pretenses that he would be helping you. It\u2019s really bizzare for a fully grown adult to refuse to contribute to the house they\u2019re living in. Does he have mental health issues or is going through something? I would have a frank conversation asking why he is unable to do these things, if he needs support in some way to be able to do these things, and if he refuses to engage with those options, let him know that you are unable to support him as you are in school and have a family to take care of and he needs to figure out other living arrangements. Unless he is just helping with bills that he is contributing to, forming a landlord-tenant relationship with a family member is not a good idea and will very likely lead to more issues.", "NTA", "You need to find out what the requirements are for evicting someone where you live.  \n\nUsually, you will have to give them an eviction notice to vacate by a certain date (even if he\u2019s not paying rent).    It may not be required where you live.\n\nNTA"]}
