I was so exhausted all weekend, and the post's comments gave me something to read when I couldn't sleep but was too tired to move. I took several people's advice and spoke to my stepson. I actually took him out for brunch on Sunday. I asked him how he was feeling about everything and the new baby.\n\nMy stepson said he was kind of nervous to meet the baby, because he's never lived with a baby before and doesn't know what they like. He said his stepbrother was easy to make friends with, because he likes games and toys, but babies can't play most games or with any of his toys, so how will he make the baby like him? I told him that the baby will love him, because he's going to be his older brother, so the baby will grow up with him as a role model. He was reassured by this.\n\nI also thanked him for helping me when I was overwhelmed. I told him he can always come to me for help when he is overwhelmed with anything. He ended up telling me that he is nervous about the eight grade. We have a high school program in our district you need high grades to qualify for that my husband wants him to get in, and it's pretty much dependant on his school performance next year. We talked about his nervousness and agreed we would talk about it more in the future as well.\n\nI'm really glad we had our talk, and it was in large part because of all of your encouragement. So thanks again.", "created_utc": 1682451021, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12ytc9r/update_talked_to_my_stepson/", "score": 464, "replies": ["Open and honest communication is always going to help.  The key is making sure to use it while you have the energy because, as you well know, there will be times when you just need to shut down for awhile.\n\nGlad you sorted things out with your step-son.  I highly recommend 1 on 1 time with each kid like this as they grow up.  It really makes them feel heard.\n\nNext step - sort things out with your husband.", "[Original](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12v47en/aita_because_i_let_my_son_ask_my_stepson_for_help/)", "Looks like a healthy relationship, I think the husband is a bit out of sync with the rest of the family.", "Thrilled to read this OP! Glad you were able to talk to him, and he trusted you to tell you his concerns. He'll be a great big brother for sure, but by the looks of it his dad is pressuring him a lot, so maybe it'll be a good idea to don't mention 'role model' too much, but just being a big brother. \n\nI do hope, however, as many others also commented here, you'll sit down with your husband and have a conversation with him as well. His behavior was really not okay, and he should've been there for you instead of getting upset with you. He was too busy to supervise and instead of checking with you, he got upset with you asking his son because his son getting high grades was more important than your wellbeing. I do hope you take this advice just like you took the other advice and know that the community will always help you if you need to know how.", "SO wholesome.  I'm glad this worked out so well for the both of you!", "Right? I just came from the original, and the considerate, caring, and helpful stepson continues to be considerate, caring, and helpful. Completely ignoring the issues with the husband's reaction.", "I second this! Especially because he got upset because she asked 'his son', he should've been there for her and especially with the baby being there soon, they should be one family.", "Update on husband tho? Did he chill out or own up to his negligence?", "Honestly, I come to this sub for the drama and dumpsterfires, but it's nice to read about a happy, healthy resolution", "Hey as someone who was anxious 24/7 about grades, tell him to get the percentages (I don't know their real name) for evaluating in each class, that way he'll have better control of his own grades, and will start to prioritize Wich tasks requiere more time and effort per their impact in his grading, that way he'll be way more calm and have an objective in mind besides just studying to try and get the best he can in that test. Best of luck to you.", "That's wonderful news. I will encourage you to make it a point to check in with him several times a week once the baby is here and continue on with it, even if it's just a few minutes each time. Make sure he know you want to know what's going on and you're not too busy for him. He sounds like a really good kid and you sound like a good mom.", "Why are the kids more mature and helpful than your husband?", "You seem to be setting him up for a home run with school and being a good person. I bet he melts when he first meets his lil bro or sis.", "Ty, also happy cake day!", "> he was kind of nervous to meet the baby, because he's never lived with a baby before and didn't know what they like.\n\nOh my heart.\n\nI'm not big on kids in general, but that boy is a fucking angel. What an amazing dude. \n\nI know you're stressed, but take a moment and be grateful for getting to be in this dude's life.\n\nAlso, you're great. Love how you're handling this.", ">He ended up telling me that he is nervous about the eight grade. We have a high school program in our district you need high grades to qualify for that my husband wants him to get in, and it's pretty much dependant on his school performance next year.\n\nThis part im concerned about, you said in your last post that your husband got upset that his son was interrupted doing an \"important project\" and seemed to care more about that than how you we're feeling at the time. It makes me wonder what kind of pressure he's putting on everyone.\n\nThat stepson expressed his nervousness about it to you is wonderful! But I'm afraid that bringing it up with your husband will cause problems. Would your husband be the kind of person to demand stepson can do better and if he doesn't he's \"lazy\"? Would he blame you for any drop in the kids grade or any failing?\n\nReally something needs to be said to the AH husband because this could become a pattern."]}
