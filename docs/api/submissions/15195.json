It's something that he grew up with and became part of his personality. I got used to it but my family hasn't yet. This would cause some minor conflicts because he isn't properly accomated at family get togethers. I kept telling him since he's new to the family, they still don't get his eating habits but he insists that my family don't care that much about him to accommodate him.\n\n\nWe were able to work some of the issues out but last week, on my brother's engagement party that was held at an upscale restaurant, my husband could not find anything to eat. I'd already told my brother and asked him for a single dish accommodation but he refused then told me my husband had to pay for \"special dish\". My husband thought this it was disrespectful to ask him to pay for his own dish at the party. He refused to come with me but I was able to convince him to come.\n\n\nWe got there and he could not find anything to eat. When asked, my brother loudly told us that we were \"free\" to pay for the dish right there and then. I felt humiliated and got up and told my husband who ws just staring in silence to let us go home. We went home and later I had an argument with my brother about how my husband was treated, my brother started arguing back saying I was wrong to expect him to accommodate my husband in a restaurant that's expensive. his fiancee said I made her engagement about me and my husband and made a scene and ruined the night.\n\n\nThey're wanting my husband and me to apologize. My husband thinks my brother is in the wrong here and that we were free to leave nomatter what. My parents are choosing to stay out of it.\n\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1681927337, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12s4rw2/aita_for_leaving_my_brothers_engagement_party/", "score": 107, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If your husband already had looked at the menu, what did expect to change once you arrived at the restaurant? The adult thing to do would have been to phone or email ahead and ask if the kitchen staff could make you a simple dish for the party, and yes you should expect to pay for it.  Which I have done a few times.     \n\n\nTomorrow morning I have a breakfast meeting, I asked what the menu was, and I will work with it, or I will just have a beverage.

Eat before you go. \n\nOn the ENTIRE menu, there was nothing? Not even something like bread that he could snack on?", "YTA.  If your DH is that picky he can\u2019t find a single thing to eat at a restaurant, the correct thing to do is to eat beforehand.  He can have a beer or whatever at the restaurant.

Hell yeah, accomodate. Dietary restrictions due to religion/ body processing issues/etc? Accommodate! \n\nPicky because your diet hasn't been updated since you were 2 and there's no mac and cheese, chicken fingers, or pizza on the menu and god forbid you try something new? Yeah please stay home from all events.", "YTA, you and your husband both actually. Your husband needs to grow the fuck up, who imposes themself on someone else\u2019s day like that? And if he requests a special meal, why is he upset he was asked to pay for it? That\u2019s the bare minimum, he should have been an adult and just ate whatever was served in the first place, but to ask for special treatment then throw a pissy fit when it\u2019s not given to him?

Kind of sounds like y\u2019all threw a fit because someone wouldn\u2019t go out of the way to accommodate your husband after they said they wouldn\u2019t. You know what\u2019s up with your husband so y\u2019all should plan ahead or not even go considering you know what restaurant the event was at and what your brother told you.

You have every right to be a picky eater, but honestly, your husband can't find one thing on the menu to eat?  It's childish.  You're married to and catering to a big baby.  The rest of your family isn't married to him, you are.  If you want to enable this for the rest of your life, go right ahead.  Your family is under no obligation to do the same.

It\u2019s not an allergy or an intolerance that he has, that could be dangerous for him. He just chooses what\u2019s comfortable for him to eat. I know I can\u2019t be accommodated everywhere, so I pay extra if I have to. Your husband could have simply gotten what he wants and pay for it. He\u2019s behaving like an overgrown toddler.", "YTA. Your family isn't obliged to \"accommodate\" your husband's picky eating. Your husband is an adult. He can eat before he comes or bring his own food.

Fellow somewhat picky eater here and it's not up to everyone else to accommodate me at a party like that. Same goes for weddings. That party was about your brother's engagement, not about what your husband was willing to eat. If your entire family is aware that your husband won't eat anything on the menu, then they probably wouldn't be surprised if he had stayed home. It also wouldn't surprise me if they're a little fed up with him expecting to be catered to at all times.

As I got older, I was willing to try more foods but I\u2019m still picky, especially when it comes to my in laws.

So unless your husband has one of the conditions mentioned above, nobody has to go out of their way to provide him with anything.

I have a feeling you and your husband have a history of these types of antics and that\u2019s why your family isn\u2019t very disposed to taking his preferences into account when making plans. People actually do that for people they like.

Having the palate of a toddler doesn\u2019t entitle a person to act like one, expecting everyone else to accommodate them.

In posts like these, people often say that picky eaters should eat beforehand, or do their best to make the accommodations themselves. I also wonder what type of picky eater he is, and if he's tried to address it at all.

Why is this even your business? Are you responsible for keeping your husband fed? He can't advocate for or make accommodations for himself? People who have specific dietary needs should not expect the world to accommodate them, (I.e. even if you're deathly allergic to a bunch of common ingredients and don't want to take chances, you call ahead to a venue to ask how their kitchen can accommodate you; then if they can't you bring your own food, and yes, YOU pay for it.)

I'd already told my brother and asked him for a single dish accommodation but he refused then told me my husband had to pay for \"special dish\". My husband thought this it was disrespectful to ask him to pay for his own dish at the party. He refused to come with me but I was able to convince him tk come.\n\n\nWe got there and he could not find anything to eat. When asked, my brother loudly told us that we were \"free\" to pay for the dish right there and then. I felt humiliated and got up and told my husband who ws just staring in silence to let us go home. We went home and later I had an argument with my brother about how my husband was treated, my brother started arguing back saying I was wrong to expect him to accommodate my husband in a restaurant that's expensive. his fiancee said I made her engagement about me and my husband and made a scene and ruined the night.\n\n\nThey're wanting my husband and me to apologize. My husband thinks my brother is in the wrong here and that we were free to leave nomatter what.

Sometimes, an Italian restaurant was an adventure for her.", "An engagement party is usually hosted by the couple and thus funded by them, no?", "That\u2019s what it means to be a picky adult rather than entitled asshole.", "I think it's that he didn't want to pay for something special off the menu. The brother had food for the guests, but the husband didn't like what was provided. So the brother said fine, order something you like and pay for it yourself.", ">If your husband already had looked at the menu, what did expect to change once you arrived at the restaurant?\n\nPerfectly said. This is the crux of it for me.\n\nEven the husband was willing to sit out the event. Attending with no plan feels like spoiling for a fight.", "It looks from the way OP wrote it that their husband already knew there was nothing he considered worth eating, because they say \u201che refused to come with me but I convinced him\u201d after the brother had already refused to pay for a special dish. They went anyway and were somehow surprised that the brother held his ground.", "Edited: I had an ex who was a picky eater (not quite as bad) but he knew his issues were his problem, and didn\u2019t expect everyone else to cater to him.  He would eat beforehand, or make special arrangements with the restaurant, not throw tantrums and expect everyone to accommodate him.", "Wondering if husband has arfid (avoidant restrictive food intake disorder) if it's really so bad. Which, while very real and distressing,  comes with knowing you have to make your own food arrangements for food you're willing to eat.  There are levels of picky, and a variety of reasons people are picky, but if you can barely find things to eat you have to accept reality.  Hell, I'm picky! But it's my problem,  not anyone else's.", "A lot of times for birthdays, engagements, etc., restaurants have a limited menu if it\u2019s a large party.", "OPs husband should have eaten in advance if he knew he wasn\u2019t going to like the food offered at the party. I\u2019m not picky, but I don\u2019t eat cheese (the flavor makes me gag) so if I\u2019m going to a dinner party with lasagna I know I need to eat before or after and let everyone enjoy their meal.

They asked about accommodations in advance and were told the situation. Sure, that situation wasn\u2019t to their liking, but they were told. How is it humiliating for the situation to be repeated to them again at the restaurant?", "I couldn't have said it better than this. ESH.", "How was the brother being insensitive? He told OP before the party that if OP\u2019s husband wanted a special dish, he had to pay for it. OP\u2019s husband should have agreed to do that instead is showing up to the party and complaining about the menu.", "It\u2019s not a dietary need.

I have definitely gotten much better as I have gotten older, which has made my life much easier. Your hubby needs to work on this. He is old enough to know that. Try 1 new thing every few days. His life will be much easier. Otherwise, he doesn't come to fancy meals with your family.", "That's how I see all this too.  I have plenty of people in my life who do make an effort to accommodate my restriction if we're going out to a meal or someone is making a meal.  It's a very nice thing for them to do and I appreciate it.  I also don't get butt hurt if someone *doesn't* do all that because I don't feel that they should be *required* to do so.  I've been in planty of situations where there was a large group of people at an event and the meal either had gluten in it or I wasn't sure if it did or not and it's never been a big deal.

That\u2019s not something we can accommodate because it would require an apple-free facility for food production. \n\nBut what we really don\u2019t do is make specific dishes upon request. \n\nIOW - we do reasonable common accommodations, not specific customizations. If you want to eat a specific dish, you have to go find and buy that yourself.", "While I agree with everything else you wrote I just wanna say some picky eaters aren\u2019t made but some of us are actually born \u201cpicky\u201d some kids right off the bat have a earring disorder called AFRID that stays still adulthood, and another reason could be sensory issues, or neurodivergence. However not excusing anything or their behavior AT ALL or saying he has any of these. Just wanted to point out that not all of us are picky by choice and it sucks", "I\u2019d have to disagree. I\u2019m a moderately picky eater, mostly around dairy. I keep it quiet and try to be discrete, but I\u2019m very adamant that I can\u2019t eat cream based sauces or mayonnaise. When I went to Poland to visit a friend, a woman invited us into her home and served us a salad with those mixed veggie medleys mixed in mayonnaises. Because I don\u2019t have a diagnosed allergy, I told myself to be an adult and try the food this gracious woman prepared for me. I took a bite and very nearly regurgitated it on her table. I didn\u2019t, but had such a gag reaction that I made a scene and was so mortified. I decided then that another way of being an adult is getting to NOT eat foods that I don\u2019t want to eat. \nI got sick a lot as a kid, and still have undiagnosed stomach problems, so while I think my problems are only mental, they manifest very strongly as physical. I try very hard to make it a non-issue, but people just LOVE to tell me how good something is, or that I should just grow up and eat something. It\u2019s unreal how offended people get by a polite refusal of food.", "Eloquent explanation  of the facts.", "You are dead wrong with that picky eaters are made by parents who give into tantrums. \n\n\nMy parents tried everything- from you have to taste it, you are going to eat what is on the table, sitting at the table till I would eat it and yes, eventuelly even screaming. \n\n\nI ate nothing. Very very few vegtables, no meat, no fish and also not kids food like fish sticks, pizza, spagetti with meat balls or mc donalds. All I ate were fruit, bread, cheese, cucmber and tomato. VERY sowly and pretty late (around 9/10) I started to eat a bit more. By now (30) I eat more, like a little bit of everything, but am still picky. \n\n\nYou are right that adults can handle themselves. I find something to eat on every menue. If I don't want to eat something, I simply don't. And of course, I would be fine paying for special food if nessary. \n\n\nBut my parents definitly tried absolutly everything to get me to eat atleast like a normal child.", "Exactly, my husband grew up with a very midwestern palate. He never tried Indian food, pho, sushi, and etc. until he went off to college. The most \u201cexotic\u201d food he said they\u2019d get growing up was Panda Express. \n\nI grew up the opposite but I\u2019ve always been a picky eater (although I\u2019m now starting to grow out of it), my husband has always been a lot less picky than me! It honestly has nothing to do with how you grew up past a certain age imo.", "Yes, completely possible. However, it doesn't really matter because they got the menu ahead of time. He saw that he couldn't find anything and told the brother. Brother said he would have to pay for the specialty item. They showed up anyway and still demanded brother to pay. Huh? You had options. A. Not go B. Go, and pay for your special meal.", "Yeah maybe, he must be really damn picky though.  Even my seven year old niece who is really picky will eat some noodles with butter if she can't find anything she likes on the menu, essentially every restaurant has something along those lines.", "IDK, I guess all people do things different ways.  To me, if the purpose of the party is to celebrate some important event (birthday, engagement party, graduation, etc.) the person who is being celebrated isn't the one picking up the tab.  \n\nBut different strokes for different folks.", "Yup. Those are called prix fix menus.", "I've had the displeasure of being around some pretty entitled and demanding vegans. My comparison stands, lol.", "Humiliating in the very public and loud way the brother handled the husband. Could've been done a lot better. \n\nI agree with you in general though, OP and husband have issues they shouldn't be asking others to solve.", "Exactly. It\u2019s not like this is just a random outing, it\u2019s her brothers engagement party! He shouldn\u2019t have to accommodate the preferences of one person.", "Exactly, I suck it up if its a special occasion too. I eat beforehand and just have drinks while I'm there. There's ways around these types of situations.

If there's meat or bread (which there is almost ALWAYS bread at fancy places), I'm golden. There's food I can find to eat at any place. And if it meant having a really nice meal that I will actually enjoy, of course I'd pay the extra to be able to enjoy the evening, if i have it.

I can almost always find something on the restaurant menu I\u2019ll eat (usually a burger, that\u2019s my go to in unfamiliar places!) and I certainly wouldn\u2019t expect anyone else to pay for it. People can be so absurd, like OP\u2019s spouse.", "Yep. My husband would be classified as a picky eater (although we don't use that word in our house ;-P), but he's a super-taster and super-smeller and too many flavors or smells at once overwhelm him and he won't be able to eat the dish. We have been to many fancy events where he does his best to eat what's there, and if he's hungry afterward, we get something to eat. He would NEVER ask for a special dish because he's a grown-up who can manage himself. No one is going to die because they couldn't eat dinner one night.

You politely refuse food.  You don't DEMAND that someone accommodates what you yourself describe as being moderately picky.  My girlfriend sounds nearly identical to you as far as being moderately picky.  She knows what reactions she has and the only time I have ever seen her get pushback for refusing something is when she gives pushback for it being served.  Picky eating and food aversion is also different than simply not liking something or something being dietary, like dairy and lactose issues.\n\nBeing a picky eater is more along the lines of, \"I will only eat x if it is prepared a very specific way, and that will comprise of 75% of my meals because that's the way I have always eaten it.\"  vs.  \"I'm not the biggest fan of onions, I have tried them several different ways and just don't care for them.\"  A picky eaters diet will look very similar to a toddlers because of the emotional connections to foods (and aversions) that were reinforced at that age.  \n\n\nI hate avocado to the point to where it makes me gag.  It's not the flavor, it's the texture and I know the exact moment in my childhood that reinforced my dislike.  All that being said, I would be an idiot to assume that anyone should change anything simply because of my aversion to avocado and would be a little bit fragile if people's comments about it actually meant anything to me.", "I am a picky eater (my dad swears I wasn\u2019t like that as a kid). But your story reminds me of my first date with my ex. He was having shrimp, which I detest due to the texture and we was encouraging me to try it. I didn\u2019t want to start out on the wrong foot so thought I could be a trooper and choke down a bite. Nope! The gag reflex was so intense and fast I couldn\u2019t get the napkin up in time and the shrimp flew across the table onto his plate! Then I didn\u2019t know if I should reach out and try and grab it off his plate or what \ud83e\udd23\nI will also add I do not make my picky eating other\u2019s problems so I do not get nagged at by other posters, just wanted to share this story", "Depending on how fancy the restaurant is and the type of cuisine served, I think it's entirely possible noodles and butter might be a special request.

I'm vegetarian, and I've lived in areas where meat is in everything. I just made sure to plan ahead.", "I think it depends on who is throwing/hosting the party, so perhaps there is no right or wrong answer.", "Ehh. Having to repeat the same info again/accommodate a picky eater adult at an event that\u2019s meant to celebrate me would make me annoyed enough to not be delicate in my response.

Most of our conferences now are 10-20% vegan/vegetarian, 5-10% no red meat, and 15-20% halal/no pork. We can\u2019t not do it or half our attendees won\u2019t be able to eat. \n\nIn a buffet spread, it\u2019s thankfully really easy to make one salad, one dish, and one dessert accommodate pretty much all common dietary restrictions in one shot (vegan, halal, vegetarian, dairy free, gluten free.)", "Yep completely understand."]}
