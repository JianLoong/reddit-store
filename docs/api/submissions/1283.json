You\u2019re living there for free and all he wants you to do is cook and clean on the weekends? Seems like an amazing deal for you. The brothers comment was rude for sure but it sounds like your friend took your side and stood up for you. Asking him to kick out his brother over this is a TALL ask especially since he apologized.", "INFO: How did you end up living there rent free? And was there some kind of agreement when you moved in that you would help with some cooking and cleaning since you're not paying rent?", "Info: does friend let you stay for free because you do these chores?", "So his brother said something stupid, your friend did the right thing and called his brother out on it, he apologized and you in return are going to pout, not clean or cook thus punishing yourself and your friend because you were upset about being called a housewife? Really? YTA.", "YTA.\n\nFirst off\u2026.did the comment come off a bit rude? Yes. But I can see he was probably just trying to joke a little bit with you. If you have an issue with how he spoke to you, go to him directly and talk to him- not hold a grudge. \nSecondly, you\u2019re really going to punish everyone in the house for something one person did? You need to talk it out with this guy and get your issues sorted out- you\u2019re overthinking it.", "You are living there for FREE. \n\nYour friend is not the one who made the sketchy comment. \n\nI repeat. You are living there for FREE. \n\nAll you do in repayment is cooking and cleaning on the weekend? I have come to learn that people feel entitled pretty quickly once they get used to a situation. You are not being used. Get over it and thank your lucky stars you have such a generous friend.\n\nYTA", "YTA \n\nYour roommate didn't make the comment - his brother did yet you are punishing him. You're living rent free. A bit of cooking and cleaning is a fair trade off.", "yta - why are you living there for free and not contributing to any bills or view chores as \u201cextra\u201d? Why are you punishing him for what his brother said when he defended you?", "INFO - Please clarify, your housing/bills are free. You enjoy cooking on the weekends and when the person who pays for your living expenses asks if you can make a meal you said no.", "Probably an unpopular opinion but ESH but your friend. \n\nHis brother made a pointed joke about your living situation. \n\nYou've been living with your friend for free for the past 2 years in exchange for cooking and cleaning on the weekend?! \n\nYes people will say your friend is the AH for treating you like a housewife/Maid but your kind of his defacto live in maid who is living their for free...", "YTA, living for free and being difficult for someone else's comments.", "INFO: was cooking/cleaning part of an agreement for letting you live there for free?", "YTA. Firstly. You're living there RENT FREE and you have an issue when he doesn't tidy up in his own home? Why do you care so much about what his brother says when he doesn't even live there? You are extremely ungrateful. If you have an issue move out and go rent somewhere.\n\nI hope you apologise to your friend who is housing you and trying to blame him for what his brother did.", "YTA - honestly, there\u2019s nothing wrong with what he said if you take it as a compliment, but it\u2019s good he apologized. There is nothing wrong with anyone cooking and cleaning and taking care of themselves. Friend\u2019s brother is ignorant of that fact, but just be confident in yourself. Instead of being confident, you\u2019ve becoming bitter and petty towards someone who didn\u2019t even do anything wrong.\n\nEdit: to make gender neutral pronouns as idk OP\u2019s gender", "Yta so you're going to punish your friend because of something his brother said that your friend made him apologize for?

Plus, you're living there for free?? Don't be surprised if you get kicked out and maybe learn to not let others stupid comments bother you. Time to grow up.", "YTA.  Sure, the brother said something stupid, but you are taking it way too far.  So what if you're seen as a faux housewife?  Why is that so offensive to you?", "~~I mean NTA. Your friend isn't owed anything.~~\n\nINFO: Why is the comment bothering you so much that you're taking it out on your friend? I'm glad he made his brother apologize.\n\nWhat is your history with your friend?\n\nEDIT: Wait, you're living there for free? Do you contribute at all to the household?", "I feel like this is a difficult situation: why are you living rent free? Is this a permanent or a temporary situation, and is your friend ok with you not paying rent?\n\nIf he's doing you a favour, I can see how cooking/cleaning, while not originally something he asked you to do, could become, in his mind, as your way of contributing to the household.\n\nHis brother sounds like a bit of a dick but you might also want to be careful, on the offchance that this potentially blows up into something bigger and jeopordizes your living situation.", "YTA.  Yes, the brother was rude.  But now that you\u2019ve gotten your apology, what exactly do you *want* from your friend here to make things right?  Do you want him to throw his brother out?  Because it\u2019s going to be kind of hard to make the case for that when you\u2019ve *stopped* doing the only thing that differentiates you from the brother in terms of depending on his generosity to keep a roof over your head.  Or have you realized that you\u2019re tired of being a \u201chousewife,\u201d in which case it sounds like it\u2019s time to look for a job so you can start paying rent and think about moving on?", "YTA your friend did no wrong by you, I don't know why your punishing him. I get not wanting to clean or cook for the brothers sake, but I don't see why that should stop you from treating your friend. Especially when he's doing the immense favor of giving you a free place to live, it's an even bigger favor if you're not working or providing for yourself on top of that.", "No. I chose to do them myself.", "No.", "Feels like it hit a nerve and maybe OP should examine their feelings for the roommate.\n\nYTA for letting some stupid idiot make you stop doing what you had decided for yourself you wanted to do, and then also punishing your roommate at the same time.", "If this post is real, which I'm leaning towards it not being, maybe she wants to be the housewife.", "That's literally the least you can do", "Why are you living there for free?", "Well, then she(?) needs to *talk* to the friend about that, instead of sulking and acting like the brother\u2019s still the issue here."]}
