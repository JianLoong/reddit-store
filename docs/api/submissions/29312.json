Popping back into your life after years of silence with a sob story and a request that you save them. \n\nThey will live in your house, trash the place, eat your food, lay about all day playing on their phone and contribute nothing.  They will refuse to get a job, they'll milk the government benefits all they can, and when you finally get fed up and kick them out, you will still be the bad guy.\n\nI speak from experience.

She wasn't fired- she quit?\n\nShe knew she needed to pay her rent and that she had a child to take care of and she thought- you know what's a good idea? For me to not work right now.

You owe her nothing.", "If she is your best friend, it is kind of an AH move to not help her out if you realistically can. However, it sounds like she just came back into your life to ask for help.

I wouldn't trust her.", "NTA, so all of these people ganging up on you, which of them offered her a place to live?\n\nHuh, weird right?

Kate is an irresponsible 'parent'.", "NTA. How convenient that she reappeared in your life after voluntarily quitting her job and becoming unable to provide for herself and soon to be two children.

The entitlement is strong in this one. I bet she didn\u2019t even offer to pay you rent. There is no way in hell I would let her stay with me one night let along move in.  She is a train wreck. If you let her move in she will never move out. She will literally be a parasite who will suck you dry. \nYou don\u2019t owe her shit. Y\u2019all aren\u2019t even close.
