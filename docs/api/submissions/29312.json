Don't sacrifice your peace and stability for someone else's drama.", "NTA, you are not obligated to rescue Kate, especially if she quit her job.  \n\nIf their opinions are important to you, you could post into FB explaining that you are running your business out of your house, you use the room 12 hours a day, it would put your business into jeopardy, and you were very surprised that Kate quit her job and then showed up and expected to move into your place with her daughter.", "NTA\n\nYou need that space for your business. Interfering with the way you earn money so she can live (presumably for free?) in your house is not a good idea.

Do NOT let this woman move into your house.", "NTA\n\nseems she reacquainted only to ask to stay with you. You are allowed to refuse her request. To be honest it sounds like you dodged a bullet, she would likely expect a lot more than your office.

Once she got settled in, there would be no reason for her to find a job. She'd suddenly be busy taking care of her daughter. But not your house. It would be trashed.

I bet my retirement none of them would!", "NTA Kudos to you for not letting her suck you in to what will undoubtedly turn into her using and abusing you. I keep seeing posts from a woman who lives in my town in a neighborhood publication that constantly asks people for rides, groceries, a cheap place to rent and most recently, a laptop for her son. This has been going on for YEARS and no one in her family works for various reasons. She is firmly entrenched in her victim mode and so I have no sympathy for her whatsoever. I love what other people have said here about responding to the negative posts and asking when they\u2019ll be able to take her and her daughter in, rent free.
