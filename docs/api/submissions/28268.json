She insisted that dad would never see her baby, but asked to come home with husband, promising they would leave ASAP.\n\nHer husband left her a year later, she's been living in the house for 6 years now. Sister hasn't worked a full-time job but works seasonal fairs and has done delivery services. She's living off state welfare programs and used one to pay rent for 4 years. She hasn't paid any rent for the last 2 years though and won't apply for reduced rent housing.\n\nSister is pregnant again and due in about 2 months. She promised to move out before the baby is born but dad to be (48) lives in his parents house and can't support them. They want to buy land to build their own house but haven't made any progress and spend their time smoking pot in the garage Mom watches my niece but sister tells niece that she doesn't have to listen to our parents.\n\nDad (68) works full-time, long hours, and has been the sole provider for the family, he's trying to retire now but has medical issues that haven't been addressed because my mom (60) had a heart attack three years ago and needed to get an LVAD. She had been working 2 jobs saving for landscaping projects and handling the housework up until she received a heart transplant about 8 mos ago. Immediately following the transplant, she had to live near the hospital for 3 mos, so my dad took time off to go as well.\n\nSister made a few changes while they were gone, she:\n\n1. Moved niece to opposite side of the house from her-right next to my parents' room.\n2. Swapped her bed with parents bed.\n3. Moved boyfriend in.\n4. Moved contents of storage units into the house/yard. Every room has piles of stuff now and all the landscaping is ruined.\n\nMom was upset about the state of the house when she got back and started cleaning. With no immune system from the transplant, she wound up in the hospital with an infection. This has happened 3 times now. Come home, clean, get infection, go to hospital. My sister won't get rid of all the stuff she brought in and won't clean up after herself. Recently she left a pile of corn on the table while mom was hospitalized forcing mom to clean the mold left behind.\n\nI was recently blessed with my first daughter, she'll be 1 this month, and she absolutely loves my mom. I really saw how bad the house had gotten when we visited recently. I realized the danger my mom is in, and how gutted I would be if my daughter lost time with her because of this so I've been encouraging my parents to kick her out. My sister plays the guilt card, saying they'll be homeless if they get kicked out. \n\nTLDR: Sister has been living off parents' good will for 6 years and is about to have a 2nd child living there along with her boyfriend, and they don't clean up after themselves. Mom recently had a heart transplant and I'm worried about her health in this situation.

She moved in her boyfriend too sheesh", "NTA. Your sister is a mooch and is endangering your parents.", "They need to kick her out or sell the house to downsize then she will have no choice to move out", "A 32-year-old and a 48-year-old who are both totally reliant on their parents are having a kid. What a world. \n\nNTA\n\nYour sister is endangering your mother. She is forcing your father to keep working. If she hadn't been mooching for years he may have been able to retire already. \n\nThey should make her leave before that baby comes.", "NTA. You're doing what's best for your parents. Your sister needs to learn to be an adult.", "Check in with a family lawyer about what steps might be required for legally kicking the sister out of the house. They will vary depending on the state you live in. \n\nMight be worth getting some sort of legal ownership of the house. This might look like becoming a power of attorney or legal trustee of your parents estate but the lawyer can best advise you in that. Present the idea to your family. Maybe father first. They\u2019ll probably be concerned about her welfare if she\u2019s kicked out. Reassure them that sister is already getting assistance from the state and can continue to do so and even get more once she needs to have her own place. Their \u201chelp\u201d is actually hurting her right now. \nYou don\u2019t say much about your niece. Would she be safe and well cared for if she left with your sister? From what you\u2019re saying I\u2019m doubtful, so that will need to be figured out as well. CPS? A filing for custody of niece? Again, the lawyer CNA best advise but I\u2019d get started on all of this yesterday.", "NTA but approaching your parents without an alternative solution would be pointless. I think it\u2019s clear that your parents will not kick your sister out and it would be wrong for them to leave their daughter homeless while pregnant and with a young child. They probably feel helpless. My grandmother had a pretty great solution to a bad marriage, her 2nd husband was awful to her and incredibly dishonest. He took her savings and gambled it away even though she had four children to support. She loved him still and didn\u2019t want to hurt him, but he was hurting their family. So, she compromised. She found a cheap apartment, put down the first and last month rent on it and while he was out, she and her sons moved all his things over.  Your sister is comfortable taking liberties. Your parents do not want her in a dangerous situation but they are struggling themselves. It may be necessary to do something like this, it costs in the short term but may save your parents a lot over time. I suggest that if you approach your parents with a positive option for your sister they may be more inclined to nudge her out the door. You may have to help your parents with this, calling for movers, finding a place ect\u2026 and you may have to help with costs- not for her sake but for your parents- your parents sound like they may be too exhausted mentally and physically to do it for themselves. Honestly, it should not be something either you or your parents should have to do, it really sucks but your sister will not do this for them. She is an ass. Your parents need help. With some incentive bf can find a job and move out of his parents place too.", "[deleted]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
