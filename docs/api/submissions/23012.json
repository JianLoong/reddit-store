I have stayed beside him through countless rehab stints, counselors and relapses. Last month I told him that at this point, I don't believe he's going to change so I think we need to get a divorce. He of course swore he'd stop drinking (he always promises to stop when I say I am leaving) and said he'll do anything to make our relationship work. \n\nHis 40th birthday is coming up in a couple weeks so he asked me to still celebrate with him and give him a chance to make things right. I agreed and we started making plans to celebrate his 40th bday. \n\nFast forward to last week, he already went on another week-long drinking spree. I took his phone so he couldn't get someone to bring him more alcohol. That's when a message come through from another woman. I went back and read their chain of texts where he's telling her he's divorced now and wants to take her out. She questioned him saying we still seem married on social media. He doubled down and told her we're going through the divorce now and it's really tough. He told her he's \"so attracted\" to her and he's \"been liking her online\" for a while now. \n\nAfter seeing this, it was my last straw when his alcohol addiction has already put me through so much; I cannot accept infidelity too. I am moving forward with filing for divorce and I told him I do not want to celebrate his 40th bday with him.

He may not have actually had sex with someone else, yet, but he's clearly willing to and trying to. If my partner did what he did I would consider it cheating.", "NTA for not celebrating his birthday and, crucially, NTA for leaving him. That sounds like a good move; he sounds as though he's not currently able, or likely to be able in future, to be a husband or indeed a decent human being.", "NTA.  This is about far more than a birthday.  Get an attorney NOW and get tested for STDs", "NTA.  Give yourself the gift of freedom for his birthday.\n\nSugar, you may also want to look at attending some Al-anon meetings too.", "NTA\nDon\u2019t see much reason to celebrate other than the fact it is his birthday.  I\u2019d tell him to contact her if he wants to celebrate with someone.  Sorry you are going through this and 11 years is a long time.  Enough is enough though.  He\u2019s not changing anytime soon.  Divorce him & live your best life.  Life is too short & I am afraid his really will be.  It\u2019s his choice.", "No.  Cut ties.  Move on.  He is a sinking ship.

Wow you've been through at least 11 years of hell. Close the credit cards and bank accounts and kick this loser to the curb ASAP. Why would you spend one more minute on him unless you enjoy being lied to and cheated on?", "His 40th birthday is going to be him, pissed up and texting this other woman while you're sat in the corner, watching it unfold and wondering why the fuck you agreed to it all. NTA.", "NTA. Suggest a carefully worded text.\n\n\"Dear woman I do not know. I got this number quite by accident, having confiscated my husband's phone when he was on an alcoholic binge to try to stop him ordering more alcohol. It was quite a surprise to me to see him describe himself as divorced, as he has been promising me he will stop drinking to try to persuade me to stay with him. I had intended to give him another shot, but finding your text conversation and this most recent drunken binge really were the last straws.\n\nI will not contact you again, and I honestly wish you well. I would recommend not getting into a relationship with my alcoholic soon-to-be ex, but that is your decision. All the best.\"", "I get why you're focusing on the birthday so you don't have to think about the other shit, but sweetheart, you gotta look at the other shit.  that's the big picture shit, and its is spelling out D-I-V-O-R-C-E.  \nhe will not change, he doeesn't want to change, he has no intention of changing, and he is absolutely going to cheat.  You CANNOT MAKE HIM BETTER.  YOU CANNOT  \n\n\nGet yourself out of a bad situation.  \n\nas a celebration of his birthday, get yourself a divorce lawyer and get out before he drags youo down any further with him", "You have permission to leave him", "Nta\nHe's 40, he can plan his own bday party if he wants one. His soon to be ex doesn't need to hold his hand.", "NTA. \nAddicts usually will only get help if they find it benefits them more than the addiction. If he has already proven time and time again that he will not get sober and then tops it off with online flirting/cheating, I would suggest you remove yourself from him immediately. Find a place to stay asap and deliver the divorce papers. Also I would consider looking up codependency and finding a support group for ppl who have been living with addicts. That sht is tough and they do push boundaries on every person close to them, often leaving ppl with an unclear sense of self, right or wrong. Please reach out for support, as recovering from being near an addict is no joke.", "I can\u2019t believe you think you even need to ask. NTA obviously. Please take care of yourself you deserve to be happy", "NTA. Why would you celebrate, you're planning a divorce, he is not living in reality. He is already telling people you are getting divorced anyway, you're doing him a solid.", "As a recovering alcoholic.... leave him. The whole \"drunk mind speaks for a sober heart\" idea is nonsense, but his repeated relapses and attempted infidelity are not things he can blame on his alcoholism. He has to WANT to change to see change. For me, my girlfriend (now fianc\u00e9e) said it was her or the booze, and left me. Lemme tell you, that warm whiskey feeling is nothing compared to the warm feeling that I had holding her, and I gave it up on the spot 14 months ago. Now, I HAVE had a couple of slip ups, but they were single drink moments of weakness (my brother committed suicide and I slipped) which I was honest with her about and got additional sober support for to insure against future slipping. Do yourself a favor and let him spiral down to rock bottom, it's the only way he will stop. Best of luck!", "NTA. He has nothing to offer you. Why would you celebrate him?", "NTA. He's lying. He's cheating. He's a drunk. They are not connected at all points. Kick him to the curb where he belongs. That man sounds to be a giant heap of lies.", "NTA, why celebrate anything with someone your about to divorce", "Nope! NTA-he is responsible for what he does when he\u2019s drunk. Time to follow through-he didn\u2019t follow through his end of the deal, so you now must. Divorce papers sound like the perfect 40th birthday gift.", "NTA . Divorce him and live your own life. Life is too short to waste it  with someone  like him", "An alcoholic who is now attempting to cheat on you. Of course you're NTA. Get out of this relationship.", "Keep moving. Fast. NTA", "NTA shake this loser.", "NTA, but divorce papers sound like a great idea for a cheating alcoholic", "NTA. If you're \"already divorced\" in his mind, then you shouldn't even bother with him any more. If you've been putting up with alcoholism that's gotten in the way of your relationship and his career for years, to the point where you are already almost leaving, him texting other women is just unbelievable. If he wanted you to stay he would be doing anything that he could to make that happen. Quitting alcohol, but especially not talking to other women.", "I wouldn't even say all that. If it was me, I would simply say \"This is his wife (that he is still living with and NOT divorced from yet) and you can have him. I hope that you have just as much trouble with his binge drinking that I have had over these past 11 years.\"", "u/Bully_Blue_Balls...Thank you for your honesty about how you got into recovery. I applaud you for making the decision that your fianc\u00e9' means more to you than the drink.", "Yup, better."]}
