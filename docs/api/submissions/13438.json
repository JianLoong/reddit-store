Our oldest in 8 & youngest 2. I didn\u2019t have an easy upbringing\u2014 both of my parents died when I was a child & I dealt with a lot of poverty growing up so I have worked really hard to give my children better than what I had. I have worked jobs that were hard on my mental & physical health, sometimes 2 jobs at a time to bring in more income. The only time I didn\u2019t work full time was 2022 while I was in nursing school but I still contributed financially. \nMy husband has never really allowed me to have any say over where we live. When I was pregnant with our oldest we bought a mobile home that was supposed to be a temporary place to live but 9 years later we still live there. Despite being able to afford renting a home or buying a home, he has never been on board. We are cramped for space (2 bedrooms/4 people) & the mobile home has MAJOR cosmetic issues & other breakdowns that haven\u2019t been fixed. Anytime I try to talk to him about how unhappy I am to live in it with our kids he gets very mad at me & tells me I am ungrateful & stupid. Anyways\u2026 he finally agreed to purchase a home & we just got pre approved. Our budget is $200k but I found a home that is $140k. If we invest $20k into renovations, it will be a beautiful home. He was totally on board, but now that we are ready to make an offer he says he does not want to do the renovations. He says it\u2019s stupid to put 20k into a house that won\u2019t be our \u201cforever\u201d home. I got really upset at him and we are fighting over it. Even if we don\u2019t intend on it being our forever home I want to make it a nice space for our family. I never lived in a nice home when I was child and I want my kids to have that. Is that shallow of me? We can definitely afford it, especially since it\u2019s under our budget. I told my husband that if we don\u2019t agree on the plan that I\u2019m not purchasing a home with him, so now he\u2019s pissed. Am I the asshole? \n\nI forgot to mention- 2 years ago my car was totaled in an accident. It was an older vehicle that I paid off, so there wasn\u2019t a loan. After it was totaled we went car shopping and he bought an SUV thats $40k. We are upside down. I didn\u2019t want to purchase a vehicle that cost so much but he insisted. I don\u2019t understand why he is okay with paying $40k for a vehicle but won\u2019t put $20k the home.", "created_utc": 1680027227, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/124xbdo/aita_for_refusing_to_purchase_a_home_with_my/", "score": 113, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

No.  I say buy a home for you and your girls and let him be in the mobile home with divorce papers.

He sounds like an idiot.", "Well isn't he just a wonderful ball of red flags and verbal abuse. My dearest, you do not have to tollerate any man speaking to you that way, and I suspect, judging by how your husband has exhibited no ambition to rise above his current station, that you have outgrown him. The same way you have outgrown that old mobile home. You should probably have a serious discussion about this, he can either keep up or be left behind.", "NTA file for divorce first then buy a home only in your name. You are married to a verbally abusive AH who wants to control you.", "NTA. Have a further discussion with him, and try to convey exactly what you said in your post, that it would mean a lot to you, that its an investment, and see what he says. It really will tell you a lot. but you have the right to have a say in where you live, especially if you are also earning money", "INFO How much visibility do you have into the finances? I don\u2019t mean what he tells you or talks about, but do you see the bank account statements and can you track money coming in and out?

It is NOT stupid to put 20K into a home, houses appreciate in value and granted, some remodels and renovations don't add to the value, others DO. AND even with the 20K you are saving 40K, by staying way under budget. I don't think I would buy a home with him either, I mean...will you stay together? I hate to say that, but I just see some major control issues with this relationship.", "NTA - He is financially irresponsible and lazy. Is it your money to buy the home or combined finances to buy the home? I recommend moving your money into an individual account and having your paychecks be direct deposited into that account. \n\nPlan for a divorce\u2026I am not saying it will happen, but he is clearly leeching off you by taking your insurance money and buying himself a vehicle you can\u2019t afford. If you are upside down on the SUV, you are not in a position to purchase a house.\n\nKeep your finances separate, so he can\u2019t claim half of what is yours. If you want the house, get the divorce and say it is just for financial reasons and that it won\u2019t change anything. Or contact a lawyer and learn if you can buy a house without him and not have to give him half of it if you divorce\u2026because he will take half your money. The other option is that if he makes more and has more, divorce him for half his money and buy the house. \n\nI am not usually pro-divorce, my family is very anti-divorce, but if he is harming your children\u2019s lifestyle and beliefs about what lifestyle they should live when they are adults\u2026that is a major rift in a marriage. Try couples therapy, but in the meantime, be sure to separate your finances and then each of you will need to limit spending to your own means.

He doesn't care about the house.", "NTA - so many red flags!!! Do not purchase a house with your husband. I really question his thought process and what seems to be his tight grip on how your JOINT savings are being spent. One might question if he has malicious intent tbh. Even if he doesn\u2019t, the name calling in unacceptable and his logic makes no sense. Whereas clearly you have very good and clear intentions for your life and that of your children.", "I might have missed this, what does your husband do? How does he contribute to household income? \n\nI\u2019m getting couch jerk vibes from him, you know, like when one partner lies around on the couch all day while the other one works but still tries to run the money show.", "Your husband has a very odd sense of priorities. In fact I would go as far as saying he is TA. \n\nYou are definitely NTA and stuck between a rock and a hard place.", "NTA, but why have you been with this guy for ten years?

I never lived in a nice home when I was child and I want my kids to have that. Is that shallow of me?>>\n\nI don't think that's shallow of you at all. I'm far from a millionaire, and I live in a high cost of living area. My home is small, and not expensively decorated, but it's cozy, comfortable, organized and pleasant. This is very important to me. I feel, in a way, that a home is an external reflection of our inner selves. I want to make the most of what the universe gave me in terms of my looks, my intellect, etc. I'm neither a genius nor a great beauty, but I try to do the best with what I have. I think the same thing applies to your home. If you said you wanted to bust your budget to spend $150K on an addition or a fancy pool, I might roll my eyes. But you're buying a house under budget, and you want to spend about $20k in renovations to make it more pleasant and attractive. Having spent that 20K, you'll still be under budget.\n\nNTA.", "He wanted a car that was better than the place you house your children period I almost never agree with the common knee-jerk divorce reactions on reddit, but if you really want your children to have the kind of home that you did not have, and you are actually in a financial position to give it to them, wild dogs couldn't keep me from doing it.\n\nHe standing between you and a better life for your children.\n\nFirst I would check and make sure that you really have all of the money you think you have.

I'm sure he's in demand at all the finest social events and dinner parties. \n\nNTA, but I don't see an easy resolution to this situation. It seems like it's mostly about control for him, and I doubt he's going to go along with anything unless he gets his pound of flesh.", "Young love can turn into adult nightmares. Trade up time.

It also raises the value for when you eventually sell and downsize. \n\nWhat's your income distribution, fairly equal? Do you make more or does he? This is the only thing I can see having an impact on why he might he monopolizing the financial decisions. But even if he makes more, the fact of the matter is you're still under budget and this improves your lives, so there's no reason not to do this. Further, your name is also on this house, right? So you get say, too. \n\nI do worry about the bigger picture here. He's been controlling your living situation for a long time and doesn't seem to want to let up on that. He also seems to be making all the monetary-based decisions with YOUR income but none of your say. This isn't a good situation going into home ownership, at all.", "You don't have a house problem, hon, you've got a husband problem. You are absolutely in the right  for refusing to buy the house with him. Don't lock yourself down by buying anything with him before you haven't sorted your problems out. \n\nNot \"allowing\" you to have a say..., calling you ungrateful and stupid, I would kick his ass to the curb faster than a gnat could blink. He sounds like a controlling, abusive a-hole.\n\nI know Reddit has a rep for recommending divorce, but this is one of the few times I actually agree. If a man doesn't treat you with respect and as an equal, he doesn't deserve to have you in his life.", "Uh, your husband is abusive. The choice of where to live should be a joint decision. I think this isn't just about the renovations for him. He doesn't want to buy a house and he wants to stay in the mobile home or only live somewhere he wants to live. He doesn't mind blowing money on a car because he's selfish and controlling. Your kids should not grow up listening to him insult you.

I can feel your resentment from here! Make a plan and do what you know is right for you. I stayed longer than I should have, mostly out of fear of making it on my own. He's not going to change, and you will be happier without him controlling you and name calling.  He has no idea what he's talking about as far as putting money into a house is concerned, he's just saying that because it doesn't serve his wants.", "NTA.

Good for you standing up for yourself about financial decisions. \n\nAgree with the others that your husband is controlling and financially abusive and you should not get any deeper into this than you already are, and should be considering divorce. You need to have equal say in where you live, what vehicles you get, and what you do with money.\n\nI do want to caution you as well to think about what's different between the mobile home and the house as far as repairs getting done. You've now lived in the mobile home for 9 years without getting necessary repairs. What has changed to enable you to get all the repairs needed on the house when you couldn't over the 9 years you lived in the mobile home? If he is refusing to allow you to repair the mobile home, hire someone that can, or make the repairs himself he'll likely be the same way once you move as well. If you move into a house with him and he pulls the same tactics you may just end up moving from a trailer that's in dire need of repairs and not a good living space to a house that's in dire need of repairs and not a good living space. You owe yourself and your children a safe, healthy place to live and you need to take steps to get that, even if it means divorcing your husband if he's part of the reason you and your kids haven't had that for the past 9 years and may not have that in the future.
