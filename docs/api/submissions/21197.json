What will happen if you run into a big problem?

From the way you've described it, this doesn't sound like a healthy marriage at all.", "ESH.  Honestly, you sound like a decent guy, OP, but you and your wife together sound exhausting.  You say you love her but your marriage sounds really unhealthy.  You two aren\u2019t partners at all - you are opponents.", "ESH I wonder if you've ever watched her parents interact with each other? Do they argue all the time? I wonder if that's why your wife has this weird idea in her head that this is how couples communicate.\n\nIt's great that you're so aware of the dynamic going on, but I think the way you decided to deal with it makes you an AH. You're basically treating her like an annoying child and you think you know better. That's not healthy in the long run.", "Dude wtf are you doing with this relationship?

Probably yta as you are the one giving up. \n\n\n\nPretending that is is normal you wouldn't tell her about buying a new grill is an shole move.

At wich point to you plan to let that go? \n\n\n\nThe house ... seemingly you went house shopping before talking about and agreeing on what you even wete looking for. And as you are the one whos time is to precious to talk tbings through I do have the suspicion this is not on her alone. \n\n\n\nThis will probably be unpopular but you behaviour is more toxic as hers in this case. \n\n\nMy advise:\n\n\n- you two should seek couples therapy/counseling/visit a seminar specifically regarding communication and compromising. This is not meant as a random \"seek therapy comment\" but the good thing about all of it is that the problem is specific. These are way easier to solve as general problems. \n\n\n- I'm not saying that your wife being bad at compromising is okay in any way.

I guess moving forward, your wife took that to mean she can do anything she wants because you will just allow it.\nYou are in a partnership and you are both one team.

It\u2019s not the biggest thing, but the mindset makes it clear why OP\u2019s communication with his wife has become so twisted and generally shit.\n\nNothing OP has done is as toxic as berating him for not disagreeing with her in the way she wanted when he acceded to her preference.\n\nThe only question is about the financial abuse allegation.
