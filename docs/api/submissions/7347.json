Typically get home around 6 or so. I finish up, forgo a few errands and rush home around 5:20. He says oh we decided not to go. I said I wish you would have let me know, I was in town and came straight after the meeting and didn\u2019t finish everything else to be here in time. Cool and calm delivery.

I am still figuring out how to get through to my own, that things will happen Not because I intentionally create drama or wanna draw attention, and that if anything, I hide pain until I can't anymore... this one was by far the worst:\n\nA few months ago - September 9, 2022 - I had severe abdominal pain that kept me awake all night and all I could do was moan. He was comforting at first, but sleep deprivation eventually irritated him and he thought I was being over-the-top. A friend of mine knew I wasn't feeling well as I'd gotten sick Very quickly the night before while he was at work, so she came to check on me. Well, right before she and her boyfriend showed up I was having to deal with his downplaying what I was going through, I realized I wasn't going to get any peace so I asked my friend to take me to the hospital. One look at me and she agreed without hesitation.\n\nIt was fortunate my friend was there: the intake technician did my vitals three times after I barely held it together. They ran a CT scan and gave me a bed, and while I waited for the doctors I had told the nurse my pain level was 10, she stepped out, came back, and loaded me up with Fentanyl. During this time my friend who drove me had called my husband, who was finally at my bedside before the doctors came in.\n\nPerforated Appendicitis. The perforation caused three abscesses that were threatening me with sepsis. They were not confident that I would make it, without treatment I had about two hours left to live. Good thing I was loaded up, that's all I can say. (The fentanyl had taken away my mental and physical anguish, looking back I now know its power and its danger. It drowned out all anxiety and I was released from pain, I was told that I could die and I did not care. That drug belongs Nowhere on the streets... It is palliative, pure and simple.)\n\nSurgery was too risky so they put me on IV fluids, antibiotics, and had to live with JP drains for two Months after I was hospitalized for a week and a half. My husband was absolutely wracked with guilt and any time I would feel pain, he was as hypervigilant about that as he was ensuring I was toeing doctor-directed guidelines. He's told me he's sorry, profusely, and the reason I am forgiving him is because no one can change the past. I wouldn't continue if I thought he was beyond redemption.\n\nThis comment is a lot longer than I meant it to be, but after reading about your son choking I was compelled to share. I hope yours will pull his head out of his ass. I believe mine is trying... I just don't know if he needs to try even harder, because I know my tendencies - I raise the bar high and hold it over people's heads. All I know is that it's a process, it's never instantaneous, and that while one may slip and fall along the way, doesn't mean they don't love you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
