That was a gift given to your nephew; your brother has no right to do anything with it.

What a low-life asshole. \n\nNTA OP. Your poor nephew.", "NTA.  Not allowing your kids to have ownership of their possessions is traumatizing for most kids.  Wouldn\u2019t be surprised if his kid cuts him off as soon as he is able to.", "NTA. He stole from her son to pretend to be a good person to his girlfriend. Disgusting.", "NTA! Your brother is acting entitled to his son's things. The Jersey was not for him to give away esp bc it was a gift from you to your nephew. He did not even pay for it! Don't feel bad for saying the harsh truth. Your brother is prioritising his gf's son over his own son.... That's just sad.", "NTA - tell the gf where the \u2018present\u2019 came from, that YOU gave it to your NEPHEW.  \nI doubt she\u2019d still be impressed", "There's a big difference between insulting someone and reflecting a mirror back at their actions. You did the latter and have nothing to apologize for.\n\nNTA and I hope you keep a good relationship with your nephew. It might be one of the few good adult relationships he has if his own dad freely favors someone else.", "Your nephew telling you that his father is behaving as he does *makes* it your business. If a child's parents are bad parents, it's the responsibility of other adults to do what they can for the child (within reason, of course). Calling him a bad father was entirely called for. NTA.", "NTA that wasn\u2019t his property to give and I\u2019m sure hurt your nephew like hell!! That\u2019s a terrible parent! Gave his sons treasured gift to his gfs kid for clout, way to show son that the gf means more to him than his own child. Glad you said something. If you\u2019re able you should buy the kid another one and tell him \u201cthis is yours, don\u2019t let anyone take what I give you, ever. I got it for you bc you\u2019re special to me, I love you more than anything\u201d cuz dad damn sure isn\u2019t conveying that message. Poor kid eta grammar", "NTA. Your brother ITA. While dad may currently be happy to steal his kid's stuff, It seems likely the son will one day come into possession of a feeling of loathing for his jerk dad that nobody will be able to take from him.", "So for the jersey, are you able to custom made add your nephew's name on it??", "NTA.   \nTell his gf where the gift came from. That should impress her.", "NTA What a crappy thing to do.

Your brother was just too lazy to go get a gift for his girlfriend\u2019s son and decided to regift an item that didn\u2019t belong to him. You are NTA, because a good dad would not take his child\u2019s shirt to give to someone else.", "NTA \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f My brother is a terrible dad and we let him know all the time", "NTA. He took your gift and gave it to someone else to look like the big man. You should advise his GF that he is a thief and where that jersey came from. Then she'll be just as disappointed as his son. Of course, if she shrugs it off, it is a match made in heaven.\n\nI suggest all future gifts to your nephew have his name embossed on it, so it doesn't get regifted by his less than stellar father. Make it as difficult as possible for anyone to not notice that it was your nephew's first and foremost.", "Nah OP your brother is a shit dad, he's thinking with his dick and he's ruining his relationship with his son in the process.\n\nYou rightly called him out on his shitty behaviour and hopefully this gets him to reevaluate his parenting style and priorities. NTA", "NTA. Your brother is not entitled to give away your nephew\u2019s possessions to impress his girlfriend - doing that DOES frankly make him a terrible dad, at least momentarily. What does that action tell your poor nephew about his place/importance in his dad\u2019s life?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
