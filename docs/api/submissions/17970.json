For supper today she wanted meatballs and barbecued potatoes. \n\nI\u2019m autistic so I have sensory issues with food. I cannot handle sauce or potatoes in any form, this meal was not for me. Obviously I didn\u2019t complain because it\u2019s rude and anyway it\u2019s not my pick. Normally, if one of us kids has food we don\u2019t like, we can make ourselves sandwiches or cereal. I decided to do that today. \n\nWhen we cooked my moms food i dished out seven servings and then made myself a sandwich before sitting down. Every one dug in immediately except my dad, he was glaring at me. After the meal and cake, everyone left the table and my dad came up to me, telling me how rude it was that I didn\u2019t eat the food my mom chose for her birthday. He called me spoiled. I told him that I had sensory issues with the food, he usually understands, but he said I should have sucked it up for one plate of it. I don\u2019t think I could\u2019ve but I guess I should have tried? I genuinely am not sure AITA. All the birthdays before this had always been something I could eat so I\u2019ve never been in this situation before, so I don\u2019t know if it really was rude or if my dad is overreacting. Nobody else commented on it, not even my mom herself, so idk.

How could the dad have not seen this happening if there\u2019s a food chosen that someone doesn\u2019t like? This surely should\u2019ve happened at least once before with someone. I\u2019m willing to bet he\u2019d have a very different opinion if it was something HE didn\u2019t like. Also it\u2019s not his choice either so he should shut up.

His \u201crule\u201d is ridiculous.

You did the right thing by just making an acceptable food for yourself instead of trying to eat the food and possibility throwing up (happened to my husband) or simply making faces at the table. Did your mom mind it? No? Then your dad can chill the f out.", "NTA. Your dad is having a parental temper tantrum.  It\u2019s a power thing and should not be rewarded.
