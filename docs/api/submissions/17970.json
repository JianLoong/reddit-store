It may be food related or it may have nothing to do with food or even you.

NTA, your dad clearly doesn't actually understand", "NTA. That is an accepted practice in your home. And sensitivity to food texture can also affect how it tastes. I can\u2019t do any kind of macaroni that\u2019s over cooked. I am fine with spaghetti noodles or lasagna noodles cooked extra time but not the actual macaroni noodles or any of the spirals, bow ties, pennes etc. In elementary I was once forced to eat overcooked macaroni and cheese. I actually threw up from it because not only didn\u2019t I like the texture but I didn\u2019t like the taste. I only have a few things I am sensitive to because I don\u2019t have sensory issues in general but the things I do have, it affects how it tastes as well to me. I personally would sit your mom down privately and ask her if she was upset by you not eating the actual meal. If she was upset by it, then discuss what you can do going forward. Also let her know your dad was upset by your sandwich. If she wasn\u2019t upset by it then she needs to have a discussion with him about it. If she was upset by your sandwich, then she needs to have a conversation with him about the solution you two come up with to solve this issue. Your NTA.", "NTA. Did your dad cook this meal but your mom normally cooks? If so, that's probably what actually bothered him. Not that you didn't eat the food your mom chose, but that you didn't eat the food that he made.", "Also, wouldn\u2019t it have been more upsetting if OP had been gagging and struggling to choke down food that was triggering their sensory issues? OP picked the least attention-grabbing method of handling this meal. \n\nThe dad just sounds like he has food issues of his own. Disliking or being uncomfortable eating certain foods is not in any way a moral failing. Unfortunately a lot of people from older generations see any expression of food preference of any kind as \u201cspoiled\u201d because they were deprived of any agency over their own food choices when they were kids.", "I was just thinking grilled on a barbeque.", "Might be cooked in a foil packet.", "How was that ever a thing?
