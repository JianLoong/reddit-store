It was not her place to dictate what you wear or even comment on it, unless it was to compliment you.

If you butted heads it would be uncomfortable for both of you.  But she overstepped, and you do not deserve feeling lingering tension because of that. You handled it in a way that sidestepped confrontation and laid all the uncomfortable feelings on her, where they belong, regardless of whether you were honest.", "NTA. \n\nYou do not owe rude people honesty.
