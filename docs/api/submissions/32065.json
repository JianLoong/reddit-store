Since the birth of our Daughter, his parents have visited one time. The day they came over was not even the day they said they would be over either. They told us they were going to be over on a Sunday and instead showed up that Saturday afternoon unannounced while we were getting ready to leave for a birthday party for my cousin. We ended up arriving to the birthday party late so that way we could at least visit with my husbands parents for an hour or so. \n\nfast-forward to mid October I realize we haven\u2019t set up when we are going to visit with his family for Thanksgiving (we usually celebrate Thanksgiving and Christmas at the same time with them - MIL\u2019s wishes) His mom usually prefers Saturdays so I gave my husband the two Saturdays. We were available from the beginning of November to Christmas, but told him to also let her know we could make any Sunday work. His family usually has us over on a weekend for holidays while we visit my family on the actual day. My husband and I have very full weekends due to a dj side hustle. When we gave her the dates, she said, neither of those Saturdays work for her, we reiterated the fact that we could make any Sunday work with no response from her. A couple weeks later she text my husband to say they could do the first weekend of December, weather permitting at his Grandpas house. (His family lives less than an hour from us but if there is a singular snowflake they will cancel) We agreed and set the date. \n\nHere is now where the issue lies, my Alma mater\u2019s football team has had one of the best seasons they have ever had. We have attended a few of the games and last week they had their State semi-final tournament game which we went to and they one sending them to State for the first time in the program's history. The State game is on the same day as our Thanksgiving with his family. WIBTA for canceling with them so we can go to the game instead? \n\nJust a quick side note - our Daughter is now four months old, their only grandchild, and my In-laws have met her once. They have made zero effort to see her and I will not beg someone to spend time with their Grandchild. My MIL didn't even come to my baby shower\n\n*Edit*\nI realize my side note about her not attending my shower makes me seem salty about that, I'm not, I've made my peace with that. What I am salty about is the abandonment trauma my husband has from her And how badly I see it affecting him now with them not wanting to be part of his daughter's life.", "created_utc": 1701347518, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/187hgu4/wibta_for_canceling_thanksgiving_with_my_inlaws/", "score": 43, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What is this, Texas and their rivals between teams with nicknames you can't find in the dictionary? You're not even attending anymore!\n\nYes, YWBTA to decline, let alone cancel, a holiday gathering to attend a sports event. Even a championship.", "Yes, YWBTA\n\nCancelling because you got a better offer is rude.", "Sorry, but YWBTA. Your feelings towards your inlaws are coming through and coloring your judgment here. They may not be the inlaws you wanted, but other than just being distant abs showing up on the wrong day, they really haven't done anything particularly egregious. \n\nIt's a game. Honor your commitment you made.", "YTA, you made plans, but want to cancel for a football game, this makes you no better than they are.", "Yes, YWBTA if you cancel plans just because something *better* came up.", "I\u2019m old school. If you make plans you don\u2019t cancel for a better offer unless it\u2019s really important or an emergency. If you really want to go I would do it right away and see if another day works for everyone but keep in mind that whatever you think of your in laws they\u2019re still your husbands parents and you don\u2019t want him caught in the middle and hurt by all of this", "YWBTA All those compliments may be valid, but this is really about you wanting to go to a football game. If he already has family issues, why would you risk making it worse for him?", "OK, generally, backing out of a social event after you have accepted the invitation, becasue you've had a better offer, if extremely rude and would mean you were the AH.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn this instance, talk to your husband and let him decide and speak to his parents. But do it fast, the later you leave it the ruder it is. IS there any room for compromise? (e.g. going to the gam then on to theirs for an evening meal?)", "1. Your baby shower invite is not an obligation ot a demand. Anyone is allowed to not attend. It doesn't matter that she is the grandma. If she has plans, doesn't feel like going, or gets sick, or anything else. She doesn't have to go, she's allowed to say no. \n\n2. Yes you wbtah if you cancel. Your jot ca ceiling for a good reason. Your trying to cancel because something \"better\" came up. You came here to justify yourself and make yourself feel better for canceling. \n\n3.it doesn't matter that mil has issue, that's for her to deal with and for you and husband to have a reasonable spine and say no when needed. But you committed to an event and you should follow through. If you didnt eant to go then you shouldn't have agreed. \n\nYour baby shower invite isn't the same as a family holiday event. The baby hower is for you, the family holiday is for everyone.", "YTA - if you start renegading on plans once you have committed to them, you are not better than the in laws. \n\nThere will be other years to watch the games. \n\nBut in the regard to your mil, if she doesn\u2019t make plans of her own in future, you throw out an invite for a Saturday or Sunday once a quarter and if she doesn\u2019t respond, then that\u2019s on her.", "YWBTA.\n\nThey came on a Saturday when they planned Sunday. Why? Did they mistake the days? What did they say? Or did you just oblige and said nothing?\n\nHave you been inviting them to meet the granddaughter? Or are you waiting for them to say they will be coming? They might be waiting for an invite. In some families, that is how things work. \n\nI know me and my husband had some misunderstandings early in our marriage because of this. One set of grandparents invited themselves over all the time. The other waited for invitation, or that we should ask them to babysit. One set wanted to express their love for the new grandchild by asking to see her, the other set expressed the same love through giving the little family (us) space and not wanting to intrude.", "YTA\n\nYou complain about the in-laws not sticking to agreed upon plans, but you want to do the exact same thing?\n\nYep, YTA", "YTA", "Yea YTA, and complaining about other stuff doesn\u2019t change that", "Mmmm I think it\u2019s important that you do this because you want to go to the game PERIOD- and NOT because you feel some type of way about your mother-in-law not showing up to your baby shower. The last line of this just made everything else sound like you\u2019re doing it because you feel like it\u2019s OK because she missed out on an important event in the past for you. An eye for an eye will only bring the family further and further apart, I think you should start with whatever unresolved emotions come with her not showing up to your shower since clearly there are some since you added it in here.", "You'd rather sit outside in December, for hours watching a football game, than have a family dinner with your in-laws? Huh.\n\nIn any case, you already accepted the invitation to dinner; etiquette allows no excuse for cancellation except for death or major illness. You're like the girl who says \"yes\" to one boy for prom, then thinks she can switch when a better guy comes along. Thbbfth!\n\nYes, YTA. No excuses you gave hole water.", "They seem indifferent, which is really weir, especially where I come from. Either way though, cancelling because something better came up is a shitty move, rude and impolite. YWBTA", "NTA because it's your choice and you have the right to do what you want. However since this is your husbands family, I would put the decision more in his hands. \n\nAlthough you're not necessarily TA, cancelling holiday plans to attend your alma maters football game is giving 'I peaked in high school'.", "As someone who comes from a shit family who always cancels for trivial shit I say go ahead. It\u2019s not the end of the world. Is it rude sure. Can you live with yourself after and deal with the aftermath? That\u2019s for you and your husband to decide. Bring worried you come off as rude if not reason enough to me to say no to opportunities you really want over people who clearly don\u2019t make much of an effort to see you. But also keep in mind they likely come from a different generation that believes it is the duty of the son and daughter to reach out, plan, and see them. Decide if that\u2019s something you want to participate in. \n\nThere are not many opportunities to do what you want to do so I say do it. But this is coming from someone who has a bad relationship with in-laws and family. So take that as you will. NAH", "NTA.  If seeing and spending time with the grandchild is not important enough to plan more visits before this then she is not so important either, is she?  Go to the game, it is a rare thing and being a grandparent will last until the end of their life.  They will have plenty of time for grandchild and if important will make the effort.  Saying that illustrates that your child is not important at all of they have not made any attempt to see their grandchild.  Take their interest level and apply it to them in return.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Our focus isn\u2019t entirely on the game and we are there with them without canceling.", "I get what you are saying I guess my big issue with holidays with her is they through them all together. All of our birthdays are within four months of each other (June - September) so we all join together at once for those. For Thanksgiving my Husband and I jokingly call it ThanksChrismHaunkkYearsEve (Thanksgiving, Christmas, Hanukkah, New Years) to each other because she mushes everything together.\n\nWe only see them twice a year - on their own doing - we extend invites constantly but they are always denied.\n\nMy husband at this point states \"You can't fix toxic\" he personally wants to cancel but the way I see it is I do not want to be the reason our daughter does not have a relationship with them. If they don't want to see her that's their loss not hers", "When they showed up we asked them, I thought you were coming tomorrow, they told us something came up and they didn't think it really made a difference which day they arrived. We have made several attempts to invite them up or come to them which they have declined. My husband's brother lives with them and has been up several times to see us and the baby.", "See I almost didn't add that. Honestly I am over the fact that she didn't come, I more added it in to try to show that she has no regard for family things. She kicked my husband out of the house the day he turned 18 and then didn't come back into his life until he asked for her to meet me when we started getting serious while dating. My husband has a lot of abandonment trauma from her and he is super torn up about the fact that his parents don't seem to want to be a part of his daughters life either", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 OK yeah I totally see how it could give off those kind of vibes lol. I live in a very small town so High School sports are how a lot of people keep in touch. If it makes it better we are friends with some of the players parents \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "Wait, this is for high school football??? Not even college level? YTA majorly.", "That\u2019s reasonable", "Your in-laws barely acknowledge their grandchild, combine holidays, and cancel plans if there's a single snowflake. You and your husband will only visit them if you can live-stream a football game. Sounds like you all deserve each other. YWBTA.", "Wow, that is rude. Doesn't really matter? Like you have no life but to wait for them!\n\nAnyway, no need to stoop to their level. You have accepted the invitation, you can't drop it just bc something bettter came up.", "With this additional information, I vote NTA, but let them know ahead of time that you will not be hosting or attending.", "I get that. What's your husband take on this? Also what time is the game? Maybe it would be possible for you to attend half the game and go to the family dinner after? Or vise versa?", "I don't really see how what level of sporting event it is changes anything. I'll take a-hole if we are to actually cancel - right now its just a hypothetical depending on what my husband decides.", "I never said we won't go if we can't live stream it, I just said that I would ask them if they are ok if we turn it on. It works as a compromise to unfortunate scheduling", "He's praying it snows and they will cancel. \n\nBoth the game and meal are at 11am, and the game is three hours away so doing both is not the most feasible option.\n\nWe do have a way to live stream the game so I think we are just going to ask if they are ok with us live streaming it there", "You don't want to go because you'd rather watch a football game. You are okay with going if you can live-stream the game while at their house. Your husband is praying for snow because then your in-laws will cancel and the responsibility for the decision is off of you. Generational behavior patterns.", "I'm ok if we don't watch the game too. he\u2019s praying for snow because he hates the toxicity he has to deal with being in a room with them. Honestly we go just to see his brother (who we visit with once a month), and his grandfather (who we see every other week)", "Sounds like you have it all figured out.
