We had been friends since 13 but lost contact after collage and reconnected around 11 months ago. \n\nA few months after dating he invited me to a party his friends were hosting, the party was 2 days and one night. And we stayed over his friends uni flat for the night.  A few days after party I found out one of his friends (who will call Les) was making the whole friend group hate me and said he hated me a lot because of what i did during the party. These are some of the examples he gave: i took a shower at 8am, i cleaned the house wrong when everyone was asleep, i bought food to make breakfast and dinner, my voice was annoying and I was childish for saying \u201cthank you\u201d to the hostess (his gf). Me and my bf were extreme upset over this behaviour and my bf tried to correct it but his friends impression of me are what Les has said ad the others were too drunk to remember. \n\nA few weeks ago I found out my bf was hiding a upcoming party that Les was hosting and he was going to. We got into an argument about it and I said i felt betrayed and disrespected. I reminded him how Les treated me and how he also hated it. My bf just said i can\u2019t control who his is friends with and I agreed, but I\u2019ve been upset since and been giving him the cold shoulder. My friends and family believe i am in the right but I don\u2019t know. Am I the asshole ?\n\nEdit: I have been talking to an old school friend Mitch, after a little chatting a found out he is a flat mate of les. Turns out the party I went to was not even HIS party. It was his girlfriends party. Les hated that his girlfriend really liked me at the party (she is bi) ans according to Mitch les has been abusive to Emma (his gf) ever since the party. The party was in December! \n\n Mitch had also told me les is a diagnosed narcissist, turns out he hated me because I made him look bad because I thanked his mum for dropping us off at the train station and les also stalked my social media and found out I was autistic. Les is known to be very ablest.", "created_utc": 1686308043, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14520ra/aita_for_giving_my_bf_the_cold_shoulder_over_a/", "score": 324, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He 's choosing Les over you when he agreed Les' treatment of you was out of line. So he's either lying to you or Les, because he wants to have it both ways.

The other reason you cannot handle and is ridiculous.\n\nHe is right you cannot control who is is friends with. But remind him that friend is actively berating you to other people. Does he not see a problem with their behaviour. Hiding the fact he is going is further sign of admission of guilt. He knew it would cause conflict. \n\nYou may not be able to control who is friends with, but you can certainly control if you want to stay in a relationship with someone who is happy to be friends with someone who openly insults their partner.", "NTA, your bf hid invite because he knew his actions were questionable. what kind of behavior he accepts from his friends in the future. if your bf is like that it's ok to talk shit about you and he's just going to accept it. i would leave him", "NTA \n\nI would have been so flattered and grateful if I\u2019d hosted a party and someone who attended was kind enough to clean up (as long as you didn\u2019t vacuum and wake everyone I don\u2019t see why anyone would be upset) and as far as taking a shower at 8 am.. gee was the shower as loud as a sonic boom?! \ud83e\udd23. I\u2019m sorry that Les doesn\u2019t understand that you were so kind in what you did. As far as your boyfriend goes, I kinda get why he\u2019d not want to expose you to further hurt by taking you to another party at this man\u2019s house and exposing you to hurtful behavior by Les. He definitely didn\u2019t say it in a great way, but that could be the reason.. ? I myself wouldn\u2019t defend Les, but it\u2019s really hard when you\u2019re out in the middle of two people you care about, I\u2019m not defending your boyfriend but I understand how you both feel. Out of loyalty, I\u2019d have defended you and not gone to the second party unless Les apologized to you for being terribly rude about your actual kindness instead of being grateful. I hope I\u2019m making sense here. Wishing you the best.", "NTA \n\nWhy tf would he want to hang out with Les if he said all those ridiculous things about you. Why? What justifies it? Ask him if the roles were reversed how he would feel? \n\nHe is an asshole, maybe you guys shouldn't have reconnected.", "Nta - why would he WANT to be friends with someone who doesn't like you and talks badly about you? Because he doesn't care about you enough to miss a party.", "ESH.\n\nThe cold shoulder is never the right way to resolve an issue in a relationship. It\u2019s the adult equivalent of a toddler\u2019s tantrum. It\u2019s also kind of weird to clean someone else\u2019s house while they\u2019re sleeping, although your heart was probably in the right place.\n\nYour boyfriend shouldn\u2019t have lied about the upcoming party.", "YTA - You're the Asshole. It seems like you are overreacting and holding a grudge against your boyfriend for attending a party that his friend is hosting. While it's understandable that you were hurt by how his friend treated you in the past, it doesn't justify giving your boyfriend the cold shoulder. Communication is key in a relationship, and instead of giving him the silent treatment, it would be more productive to have an open and honest conversation about your feelings. Holding onto resentment and punishing your partner without clear communication is not a healthy approach. Consider talking to your boyfriend about your concerns and finding a resolution together.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
