My sister (27F) has had a cat ever since she moved out (our parents didn't allow pets) who has now unfortunately passed away. My sister came to visit me a couple of days ago and kept talking about how much she's grieving her cat and even now she's still crying at nights over it. My bf overheard and told her \"Isn't it kind of embarrassing for an adult to cry over a cat ? Just get another one\". My sister didn't take it well and started berating him and raising her voice at him (he also struggles with people yelling cause of his abusive dad) and at some point called him soulless, to which my bf replied that he's at least not a dumb woman like her. I tried to calm things down as much as I could, but the damage was already done and my sister left in tears. I tried to lecture my bf about what he said, but he didn't seem like he was listening to me, so I just gave up. \n\nI thought we'd smooth things over later once my sister calms down, but I just found that she banned my boyfriend from the upcoming Easter party she's gonna host and said that if I try to bring him regardless she'll cut me off from her life too. I said that she's overreacting and she knows my boyfriend is a bit stand-offish but doesn't mean any harm and I could make him apologize for what he said to her, but she said she's had enough of that jerk insulting her and everyone from our family and she knows he never means any of his half assed apologies and only tells them for my sake. She told me that I can spend time with my family or keep being that asshole's personal public defender and then hung up, which I think was uncalled for. My bf does sometimes say things that can come across as rude, but he doesn't mean them and my family was being understanding, but it seems like now that went out of the window now with my sister. I know I defend my bf a lot, but I feel nobody understands him like I do, tho I might've come across as an enabler of his bad behavior to a couple of people. \n\nAITA ?", "created_utc": 1680785481, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12djd5d/aita_for_telling_my_sister_shes_overreacting_for/", "score": 806, "replies": ["#[Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).\r\n\r\nPlease review our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq) if you're unsure what that means.", "Correct me if I am wrong\n\nYour boyfriend is a human being able to talk and to not talk, right?  \nYour boyfriend offends your sister and other parts of your family often/constantly, right?

It is common knowledge that people can become emotionally bonded with their pets, so him saying that hurt her even further. He should've atleast apologised and made a truce instead of continuing the argument.", "Info: explain how calling your sister a dumb woman was a harmless comment?", "Hoooo boy, YTA. What he said about her cat is enough reason for her to never want to be around him again unless he profusely apologizes and agrees to start using a filter before he lets things out of his mouth. You should back your sister up on this, not gaslight her into thinking the loss of her pet is insignificant. I would be FURIOUS at anyone who tried to downplay my grief over the loss of my pets, they're my little BFF's forever and no one is allowed to discount the grief of their loss. APOLOGIZE to your sister immediately (and maybe think about getting a more emotionally mature BF)", "YTA - so your boyfriend lacks empathy and doesn't respect women... am I getting that right? Why are you dating him, let alone defending him? Is he worth losing your family over? (In case you are struggling with this question: no, he is not.)", "YTA and so is he. I see why she calls you his public defender. Let\u2019s recap:\n\n*starting off by saying these N T A people saying it\u2019s just a cat are terribly cruel and don\u2019t seem to understand that cat has been apart of the sister\u2019s life for 9 years. I would be beyond distraught if either of my cats died and I\u2019m 32. Now back to our regularly scheduled programming\u2026.\n\n\n1) he was not apart of the conversation. It wasn\u2019t a \u201csocial setting\u201d it was in your home while your sister was venting to her brother. He interjected to be rude. He INSISTED upon being rude, very different. \n\n2) your sister is dealing with a loss. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s a pet or a child or a friend or hell her favorite tree in the park being cut down. It\u2019s grieving for the connection she had. The way you speak about her getting upset shows you and he both lack empathy. She\u2019s grieving, she is then blindsided while looking for support, and when she reacts you think she\u2019s berating him. \n\n3) and then the \u201cfun\u201d part- being gay does not preclude you from being a misogynist. He clearly is one. Better to be a soulless rude AH than (checks post) a dumb woman? Jesus why are you with this person.\n\n4) he has no regret for his actions and thinks he\u2019s in the right. He won\u2019t listen to his partner or care that he insulted his partners sister. This happens with such regularity you have given up\u2026. Why are you in this relationship?\n\n5) stand-offish is NOT the same as being just a rude person. He\u2019s not hiding behind walls or afraid to get out there, or not connecting quickly. He is interjecting into conversations with the singular purpose of being rude and hurting the other person. He CLEARLY means to harm with his words. \n\n6) this happened so frequently in just one year of dating your entire family can already tell he doesn\u2019t mean it when he apologizes and recognizes he will just continue to do it with no attempt to improve. \n\n7) he\u2019s a repeat offender, she hangs up in exasperation because you refuse to see the obvious and SHE did something uncalled for? You either refuse to acknowledge he\u2019s a giant asshat who keeps insulting your family, or you don\u2019t care. The sex better be amazing. \n\n7.5) buddy I promise you that \u201cunderstanding\u201d and patience your family has had with him has been wearing down for awhile. It speaks volumes that you didn\u2019t go to your parents to seek a resolution, I think because you know they are just as tired smiling through their teeth during his endless ale apology tour.\n\nI get it, you see that side of him no one else does and it\u2019s your choice to stay with someone. But is he worth going NC with your family? What about when your friends get tired of his rude comments and BS apologies? It\u2019s going to get very lonely, and I do not mean this sarcastically, I hope you really figure out if he\u2019s worth it.\n\nHe is the AH here, he is an AH I\u2019m general, and YTA for defending his behavior", "YTA, wtf did I just read? That\u2019s not just \u201ccoming off as rude\u201d that is cruel and misogynistic of him. How are you trying to justify either of those statements from him??", "YTA. Regardless of his past, what he said to your sister was unacceptable.\n\n1. He made the belittling comment about her feelings about her cat. OK this crosses a line. Rude and unempathetic.\n\n2. Then calls her a dumb woman. How TF is this acceptable? It isn't. \n\nHe sounds like a sever AH and you are enabling it.  I hope he is amazing in other things because he may cost you your relationship with your sister.\n\nI repeat. YTA", "YTA - and so is your boyfriend, sounds like both of you need to work on gaining a little empathy for others.  I wouldn\u2019t want to host either of you for dinner if I was her.", "YTA - Your family is not obligated to put up with your BF's shitty behavior.", "YTA. Your sister has had it lol. Why do you let your bf treat your family this way? Is he ever this rude to you? Sounds like he's never had severe consequences for his actions. He needs to learn now. At least he's only 19. Hopefully one day he will look back on this behavior and cringe.", "YTA your bf was cruel to your sister. Why should she have to put up with him in her home?", "YTA and your boyfriend sounds insufferable.", "YTA. Your defense for your boyfriend being an AH seems to be that everyone should know he's an AH (though you try to frame it as standoffish) which does nothing to mitigate his dickery. It sounds like it's the rest of your family are the ones who understand him, not you. If this teenager is enough to throw your family away for good luck to you, you might be doing them a service.", "YTA. He's rude and obnoxious and you defending him is absurd.", "YTA - it\u2019s her place so she can choose who is allowed. Your boyfriend\u2019s social struggles don\u2019t give him a free pass to say whatever he wants without allowing people to push back.", "YTA. Your bf have no manner, he is rude and obnoxious. You and your boyfriend are the problem here.", "YTA on the contrary, it seems like everyone understands your boyfriend but you. He\u2019s an asshole. As adults, we learn that some things are inappropriate to say to people with whom we want to maintain a positive relationship. Your boyfriend keeps making rude comments and being shocked when people don\u2019t want to spend time with him.", "YTA.  Your boyfriend doesn't say things that \"come across as rude\" he says things that *are rude* and mean, and hurtful, and apparently he doesn't apologize unless you make him.  Your boyfriend is an ass.  And your constant defending of him even though he appears to be an ass to you too, is inexcusable.  If you want to stay with this asshole that's up to you, but your family and friends don't have to put up with him.", "*Narrator voice* \"He did mean the things he said, and he didn't just 'come off as rude,' he was in fact a really rude person.\"\n\nYou can date assholes if you wish and he is lucky to have you, but there's no reason at all for your sister to have to put up with him in her home.

Just get another one\".\n\nWell that is an enormous Red flag, Jesus.\n\n> he's at least not a dumb woman like her\n\nOh look, there's another one\n\n\n>but he didn't seem like he was listening to me\n\nHuh, they're everywhere.\n\n>if I try to bring him regardless she'll cut me off from her life \n\nFair enough. Is that something you've done before?\n\n>She told me that I can spend time with my family or keep being that asshole's personal public defender and then hung up, which I think was uncalled for.\n\nNo no, definitely called for.\n\n>but I feel nobody understands him like I do\n\nThis is really common feeling with people who end up with abusers. It's a huge cliche, and they are almost always actually just deluded about their partner. \n\nYes, YTA, both for entirely invalidating your sisters feelings and for constantly trying to make excuses for someone who absolutely does not seem to deserve them. Do not bring him to the dinner. When people tell you what they are like, listen to them. Your boyfriend has even gone a step further and repeatedly shown you, and yet you refuse to accept it.", "YTA, \u201cnoone understands him like I do\u201d is code for i\u2019m dating a awful person", "YTA and it sounds like you're trying to minimize other people's feelings when your BF says offensive things. You can say he doesn't mean it but that's not really going to take the sting out of it to someone who is grieving. Not to mention, it sounds like he absolutely means it since he's not apologizing after the fact. If he wants to be invited into people's homes, not insulting them is a good start. You don't get to treat people like trash and then act like *you* are the wronged one when they stand up for themselves.", "YTA.\n\n\nYour boyfriend is a shitty person. He's rude and doesn't intent to change because it's working for him.\n\nMental health and/or other disorders and/or trauma may be a reason for his behaviour, but they are not an excuse. He still has to work on himself, work on not hurting others and change his behaviour.\n\nAnd yes, you enable him and his shitty behaviour.

I work in the animal industry and losing any animal is heartbreaking. The emotions you feel are intense and overwhelming. I have people at my job who are in their thirties, forties and fifties and they still cry. Because guess what? It sucks. Knowing an animal you loved, cared and fought for is no longer with you. Everyone grieves differently and I\u2019ll still talk about pets I lost in high school and still cry over them five years later. There is no time limit with grief and he not only treated her callously but continued to push it when he knew she was upset. I can\u2019t even understand you. He was absolutely cruel to a woman who was still so hurt. I would also never talk to him again.

I have a very intelligent autistic grandson who said things like this at 8years old because he doesn\u2019t understand emotions. He is all logic - like a little Spock.

If he wants to have relationships with people - and he does- these are skills he has to learn. Now at 13, he is pretty good at not saying the wrong thing most of the time. My point is that it may not be a person\u2019s fault that they don\u2019t know what to say and when to keep their mouth shut, but they can learn. If they are refusing to learn then they are not interested in participating in normal relationships and that\u2019s their right. But then you have to deal with that reality. If no one wants to be around your BF then he needs to own that, decide if he cares, and then do whatever\u2019s necessary.

My sister (27F) has had a cat ever since she moved out (our parents didn't allow pets) who has now unfortunately passed away. My sister came to visit me a couple of days ago and kept talking about how much she's grieving her cat and even now she's still crying at nights over it. My bf overheard and told her \"Isn't it kind of embarrassing for an adult to cry over a cat ? Just get another one\". My sister didn't take it well and started berating him and raising her voice at him (he also struggles with people yelling cause of his abusive dad) and at some point called him soulless, to which my bf replied that he's at least not a dumb woman like her. I tried to calm things down as much as I could, but the damage was already done and my sister left in tears. I tried to lecture my bf about what he said, but he didn't seem like he was listening to me, so I just gave up. \n\nI thought we'd smooth things over later once my sister calms down, but I just found that she banned my boyfriend from the upcoming Easter party she's gonna host and said that if I try to bring him regardless she'll cut me off from her life too. I said that she's overreacting and she knows my boyfriend is a bit stand-offish but doesn't mean any harm and I could make him apologize for what he said to her, but she said she's had enough of that jerk insulting her and everyone from our family and she knows he never means any of his half assed apologies and only tells them for my sake. She told me that I can spend time with my family or keep being that asshole's personal public defender and then hung up, which I think was uncalled for. My bf does sometimes say things that can come across as rude, but he doesn't mean them and my family was being understanding, but it seems like now that went out of the window now with my sister. I know I defend my bf a lot, but I feel nobody understands him like I do, tho I might've come across as an enabler of his bad behavior to a couple of people. \n\nAITA ?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

What\u2019s the point in saying shit at all? \n\nHe means everything that comes out of his mouth. His BS attempt at \u2018apologies\u2019 shows that. He only does it because she \u2018makes\u2019 him. She\u2019s in some serious denial.", "No no you don't get it, he doesn't really MEAN it when he says at least he's not a dumb woman. Like, he doesn't apologize or care that his gf is upset, but trust us, he doesn't actually MEAN the things he says and does. /s", "She's acting as if his voice is uncontrollable and that he has zero self awareness or control. And somehow that's something PEOPLE AROUND HIM should deal with, instead of working on it. Even a 10 year old would be more tactful, there is no excuse or downplaying their words. TELL HIM to stop being a spineless crybaby and man up, take responsibility than act like he can't just shut the fuck up for everyone's benefit.  which is terribly ironic since he's the one trying to make the sister seem childish for mourning her pet lol. \n\nHonestly OP and her bf sound like a match made in heaven.

I'd be worried about my future with this person.
