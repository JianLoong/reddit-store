My niece, who we will call Lily, is about to turn 5 and will be old enough to start school this coming August. Due to our large age gap, my sister and I were raised two very different ways. Addie went to public school but ultimately dropped out in the 10th grade, while I was homeschooled from the third grade until I graduated. \n\nAddie was talking about homeschooling Lily, as Addie is a stay at home mom with tons of free time. When she told me about this I told her not to do it as she would most likely be ruining Lily's life and taking away any chance of her developing normally. \n\nAs I mentioned earlier, I was homeschooled for most of my life and it absolutely messed me up. There was nothing wrong with my curriculum and I learned at a faster pace than children going to public school but homeschooling made me so unprepared for the real world. I was not socially developed enough, so when I went to college and experienced other people in a normal setting it was traumatizing. I had, and still have, severe anxiety, and would experience panic attacks just being around other people. I was very sensitive and sheltered, and I took the smallest things so personally. The first year or so was absolute hell because I didn't know how to properly socialize with people.\n\nI told Addie that if she homeschooled Lily she would be preventing Lily from developing key skills she would need later in life, and I also told her that I believed Lily would grow to resent Addie as it wouldn't be healthy for Lily to spend the majority of her time with her mother. Addie took this very personally, and assumed my objection came from the fact that Addie didn't finish high school, rather than any of the reasons I explained to her. I tried explaining that Lily needed to be around children her own age, and that even putting Lily in clubs or sports wouldn't make much of a difference because those typically only met once or twice a week, but by this point Addie was pretty much ignoring me.\n\nShe hasn't been speaking to me since this happened a few days ago, but apparently has been telling her friends and our family that I am trying to 'influence her parenting decisions' and I've gotten some pretty passive aggressive messages online because of it. \n\nSo, AITA?", "created_utc": 1684736932, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13oinfh/aita_for_telling_my_sister_that_she_will_ruin_her/", "score": 802, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Homeschooling here isn't even legal, so I really don't get this American thing.\nBut the fact she didn't end high school, and wants to be the one providing education to a kid?? You gave your opinion, because your experience turned out this way. That's normal you want to avoid it for another person.", "NTA\n\nI don't understand the Y-T-As here saying it was none of your business/not your place or whatever.\n\nYour sister initiated the conversation about homeschooling her daughter. That was her making it your business and inviting your opinion. You can't talk to someone about a topic then act suprised you get their opinion on said topic. You might not want other people's opinions, but in that case you shouldn't talk to them about it or make it clear from the start you want a one-way conversation.\n\nYou actually have been homeschooled and therefore know the potential impacts on the child better than most. That makes it your place to speak on your experience.\n\nImagine skipping forward 10 years and her kid doesn't have age appropriate social skills and has developed social anxiety etc and you're just like \"oh yeah I know this was a possibility because it happened to me, I didn't tell you though\".", "So your dropout sister without so much as a GED will be homeschooling. Your concerns are more than valid and grounded in lived experience. NTA", "NTA, here\u2019s my opinion on this from someone who did homeschooling and public school. \n\ni left public school in 8th grade due to extreme social anxiety and depression, worst decision i ever made. my mental health spiraled, i\u2019ve lost any bit of social skills i have, i have no clue how to talk to people (i do have friends which i hang out with often but it\u2019s still hard). not only that i missed out on my entire high school experience, sports, dances, clubs, etc. \n\nbut if she does choose the homeschool route encourage her to have your niece involved in things like sports, clubs, anything like that where she can be around people her age. another option that is better than public school is private school or charter schools, they typically have better educational resources.", "NTA at all and you are very right. I have seen it myself with kids to went to boarding school, they got slaughtered when they got to my UK public high school which was one of the good ones and in uni.\n\nAnother danger with this is that if someone doesn't have that needed exposure to the gender they are attracted to then 1. Any future partner is immediately put on a pedestal and 2. It makes them so vulnerable, I have seen boarding school girls get fucked over by the village horndog too many times.", "NTA at all. You are the perfect person to be giving this advice and I would advise you to continue giving it. You could save this girl\u2019s life trajectory and that\u2019s worth a little friction from big sis", "NTA. I might get downvoted, but you're absolutely right with your reasoning. Studies already shows the damning effects of the covid lockdowns on kids social abilities and overall mental health and that was 'just' two years. Science is in your side in this regard. Also voicing concern isnt an AH thing to do. In the end, you can't decide how your niece gets raised. The best you can do it to be there for her. Make up with your sister and offer help instead, like providing opportunities for your niece to socialise. Good luck!", "Nah. Fine for giving your opinion but everyone is different. I have numerous friends who were homeschooled that fair better in life than me in social situations. You have valid concerns sure but as long as lilly gets some socialization she should be fine. \nYou could have just pointed out the worry for lack of kids her age. My friends all had numerous extra activities during their youth and had no problems adapting to society.", "I'm going to go with NAH. You shouldn't have said that and I believe she shouldn't homeschool  her. Both options have pros and cons. So this is definitely a difficult decision. But at the end of the day, she is the parent. If one day her child wants to go to school instead she should have that option as well.", "YTA.\n\nYou're not an asshole for sharing your experience, but for making of your experience a general truth. \n\nYou could have told her everything you wrote here without telling her she was going to ruin her kid's life because in the end, it's not your decision to make but hers and the father of the child's.", "YTA. Your opinion of homeschooling aside, it was the way in which you approached it that makes you the AH.\n\n Also, I wasn't home schooled and I am socially awkward, diagnosed with both GAD and social anxiety. A lot has to do with the kid, not just the method.", "YTA. i had public school ruin me in numerous ways, i begged and pleaded for homeschooling numerous times because of it. this isn\u2019t me saying homeschool is / would be better, it\u2019s me pointing out everyone is different. what was awful for me, is wonderful for others. what was awful for you, is wonderful for others. the human experience isn\u2019t a one size fits all.\n\nit\u2019s great you wanted to share your experience, that\u2019s absolutely valid, but you pushed it and crossed a line when you told your sister she\u2019d be ruining her kids life by even considering homeschooling.\n\nif homeschooling is something she really wants to do / try, you should help give her suggestions to improve the experience.", "YTA\n\nFor telling her how to parent her child. She can always homeschool Lilly and put her in school at a later age. I think you are putting your experiences above your sister\u2019s - she may have had her own trauma that cause her to drop out. While you have good intentions, I think you may be projecting.", "NTA, but also not your place. I think it came from a place of love and concern from your personal experience, but at the end of the day, she gets the final say in how she raises her kids. I think a lot of parents are concerned with sending their kids to school from the stories they hear online. The school systems are at capacity so a lot of kids don't get the help they need, Lots of kids fail out of school,  there are bullying incidents, the fear of teachers being inappropriate, and now school pew pew incidents. She may have other reasons for wanting to do homeschooling that make her feel like her kids will be safer. You expressed your concern and that is all you can really do. I think you should tell your sister that you aren't telling her what to do, it's just something you feel very passionate about.", "Apart from socialisation and the shared experience of schooling, unless Addie has degrees in a modern language, English, Math, any recognised Science, any social science and either a degree or relevant industry experience in a craft technology, food technology, sports science, creative and performing arts and a bunch of other fields then **she is woefully under-equipped to teach a modern curriculum**.\n\nIf she wants to teach basic arithmetic, reading and writing and all about Noah and the ark then, sure, go ahead and wreck your daughter's future.", "YTA. As a once sheltered kid, I get where you\u2019re coming from. I too am socially inept and have severe anxiety and panic attacks due to a multitude of issues in my upbringing. However, we have to remember that not everyone\u2019s experience is going to be the same as ours, and it\u2019s totally possible to come out differently than we did. Moreover, I think you underestimate the power of getting your kids involved with extracurriculars and other ways of giving them necessary interaction. So many people home school their children, and there are things in place created by these parents to make up for what these kids lose in the public education system.\n\nAt the end of the day, it\u2019s not bad to share your opinion, but I think getting in an argument with your sister for it was going too far. At the end of the day, your job is to be the cool fun aunt, and a support system for both ur sister and her kids when needed. I would apologize as soon as possible and say that you just had a really bad experience which got you upset.", "YTA. Lily is not your child. You don't get a say in how she is raised or schooled, and should only voice your opinion if Addie specifically asks for it.\n\nButt out.\n\n(P.S. Being homeschooled does not equate to being socially stunted unless the parent deprives the child of regular social contact. Many cities have active homeschooling groups where kids meet several times a week, and there are plenty of other ways that kids can be active with other kids their age. And no, I'm not homeschooled.)\n\n(P.S.S. I'm sorry that you were so traumatized when you went to college. I hope that you are able to navigate without excessive anxiety now, and if not, that you are seeing a therapist to work through this.)", "INFO: Did Addie ever finish high school?", "[deleted]", "NAH\n\nYou shared your sincere worries with your sister based on how you experienced homeschooling and there's nothing wrong with that. Although you probably could have wirded it better than \"you're about to ruin your kid's life\".\n\nBut IMO you're missing another aspect of the picture, your sister's experience. She dropped out. Your parents sent her to school but homeschooled you. I think it's pretty clear her school experience was probably not flowers and butterflies. School can be pretty traumatic too. Some kids go through it getting their self-esteem trampled until it's mush on the side of the road.  \n\nI agree with you that school is the best option in most cases, but your experience is not universal. Ultimately it's her decision and you have to respect that.", "I don't have kids, but in all honesty, I'd be terrified of sending them to school these days, at least in the United States. Unfortunately, schools seem to have become a dangerous environment.", "Look, I'm considering homeschooling and there are ways to mitigate all of the things you've raised but they are valid concerns that DO need to be considered and incorporated into the planning. If you don't, your kid ends up really struggling in social situations for a wide variety of reasons. Especially as a teen, it's critical to have regular access to the same peer group developmentally. \n\nPublic schooling is often traumatic, especially for kids who have disabilities or are otherwise different. So I get why some people are adamantly against it. I'm more middle ground - if we can find a school my kid thrives in then that's what's best for them, but if it doesn't work out I'll home school. \n\nYour sister seems to have taken your valid criticisms of home schooling personally. I wonder if you hit a nerve that she herself feels insecure about her ability to educate her child effectively. That would explain her latching onto that despite it not being your argument at all. \n\nYou're NTA, she invited the discussion and you gave your opinion. One that is valid, based in personal experience and important for her to hear if she intends to take on the mammoth task of replacing not just the educational component of school but also the social aspects.", "NTA and I support homeschooling for many people provided they use a proper educational system for it. I have a huge problem with people who go it solo with no real support and I absolutely judge when they can't even spell things properly on their own posts online. Not that my grammar is even particularly good which is why I wouldn't think myself competent to teach it to a child. I have a few friends who are homeschooling and I feel bad for their children. One now lives in a district that is going to have to pay her almost what the state government pays the school so she looks at it now as an additional income stream as well. Her children have some special needs and truly need the support of a school and its resources but she thinks she is better than that. Perhaps have another conversation with your sister about your specific difficulties and also your benefits regarding your homeschooling experience. Then unfortunately you are going to have to let it go and hope you can fill in some of the gaps if possible. From a literal education standpoint they have a ton of really good homeschooling programs out now so hopefully she uses those and her child excels academically.", "NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

One bad experience at something is a helpful cautionary tale, but it  doesn't mean every single other person will have the same issues. \"This is what my experience was like\" is more realistic than \"This will also happen to you.\". Plenty of people are homeschooled for some or all of their academic careers and have none of these issues.\nSharing your thoughts doesn't make you an AH but since you shared it as an accusation/fact (\"you're going to ruin your child's life\") I wouldn't be surprised if your sister wanted to take a time out from being on the receiving end of that.", "So I was homeschooled and had a similar experience to the OP.  Have you ever asked your sister how she would combat those issues?  Maybe she has a plan?  I now homeschool my own children. It is totally different.  We have friends we see multiple times a week, sports, classes outside the home, etc.  My kids have said they don't want to go to school as they get their academic needs met and then have lots of friends. \n\n\nI understand your concerns though.  I totally do.  I always said before having kids it wasn't something I would do.  Living in an urban area makes the opportunities for activities and finding friends more common too.", "i assumed she would use an online program but either way her not having a proper education would make it hard. i use a cyber school program but i\u2019m pretty much teaching everything to myself and my mother (also a highschool drop out) can\u2019t help me at all. not to mention all the curriculum changes", "Agreed! Same in Sweden, there are a few exemptions, but few and far between and needs approval due to special circumstances. \n\nEven if you use a standardized curriculum, you will not be able to replace a properly trained teacher with extensive knowledge in pedagogics, or the social training from being with peers.", "[deleted]", "This! I was homeschooled for 11 grades and my husband was in public school for his whole education. Academically we are equally matched and both received high grades. I did graduate early but that was because i had the freedom to do extra work. Socially, he was awkward and bullied. He still has to constantly push himself through social situations. I do not struggle socially I was however well socialized as a homeschooled child and had no lack of friends my age. I also visited a senior\u2019s home once a week with my mom and spent a lot more time around adults than many school aged children get to. \n\nThe difference between us is family and personality. He comes from a socially awkward family.\n\nYTA OP not for giving your opinion but how. You could use the opportunity to tell your sister how homeschooling failed you and then she could make sure not to follow the same pattern your parents took. But how you handled it was based on your own issues and bias. Not every homeschooled child ends up feeling the way you do. It isn\u2019t the given conclusion to it.", "I get where you're coming from. I didn't mention it in the main post but growing up I was apart of a lot of extracurriculars (I was in several 4H clubs and apart of a youth group) It didn't really help me at all but I do admit that it could go totally different for Lily.", "Sorry, I didn't think to add this bit. No, she never finished high school. She keeps talking about getting her GED but never does it.", "Right I mean about all the kids that were traumatized by school shooting not to mention the ones that didn't come home.What about the ones that are bullied and teachers do nothing ect.", "I'm really not sure what Addie or the people here were expecting from Addie initiating this conversation.\n\nThe only valid thing from the OP-is-the-A side is that OP should have phrased it as \"my experienced of homeschooling was it caused X\" rather than \"homeschooling causes X\".\n\nHowever that's not enough for OP to actually deserve an A verdict. It would be E-S-H at most for that.\n\nBut personally I still don't think that's enough for it not to be an NTA.\n\nOP may not be the parent of Lily but her sister initiated a conversation about something OP has personal experience of. There's not some hierarchy where only the person on the top gets to speak on a topic, and even if there was I don't see why \"parent who might subject their child to it\" trumps \"person who experienced it\".

That's not how being against something works. \n\nOP didn't insult her sister, she insulted homeschooling. You are making the same mistake as OPs sister, which is viewing someone disagreeing with you as a personal attack and reacting like it was. It wasn't.\n\nThe natural hierarchy is who gets to make the final decision (the mother), not on who is allowed to speak.\n\nOP doesn't think she had authority over the final decision, she (understandably) thought she was allowed to participate in a conversation initiated by her sister about something OP had personally experienced.", "[deleted]", "\"Implies\", \"implies\", \"implies\".\n\nThat is all subjective. As in its not the objective truth, just how you interpreted it. I could just as easily use the same quotes and tag \"implies *homeschooling is a bad idea*\" on the end. Though I'd be more likely to keep it exactly as you have it, but put \"if you homeschool\" on the end, because again, OP is against homeschooling, not her sister.\n\nEven with your direct quotes you can't show a direct insult to the sister. You have to imagine extra words. Do you not see?\n\nYou and the sister are getting upset about things you had to make up.\n\nEdit: also even if you are right, it would be an *indirect* insult. If an insult relies on implications, it's *indirect*.", "NTA.  I question the teaching abilities of anyone who dropped out.  While it is posible to homeschool kids and have them come out well rounded (socially ready as well as academically ready), not all parents can pull it off.", "NTA, someone who didn't prioritize finishing their own education shouldn't be left to educate someone else.", "To me it's crazy that homeschool is even legal. NTA", "NTA. Your reasons are perfectly valid.", "NTA. Your concerns are valid. What I find kind of funny is why she thinks you're telling her she shouldn't is the reason why I actually think she shouldn't. If your ass drops out of school the last thing you should be doing is teaching children", "NTA - My parents made me go to an \"\"\"Online school\"\" through middle and high school, (not related to covid, this predated that) it took me a long time to get socialized to the real world. My sisters still haven't. (We're in our mid twenties now) Homeschooling is inherently abusive. Definitely NTA.", "I'm leaning towards NTA. I could see where your comments might have hurt her feelings, but the fact that she didn't seem to address your concerns but seemed to deflect to her own insecurities about not finishing school is the bigger issue. Homeschooled kids can get socializing thru other ways like sports or such but I'm assuming if Addie was planning on doing that, that would have been her defense. And you're are very correct that learning to socialize with other kids her age is crucial for social development. Makes me wonder if Addie is homeschooling her kid to somehow prove she's smart enough to despite not finishing high school? Idk tho it's impossible to tell from just the post, but usually over the top emotional reactions are usually a subconscious defense for insecurities. \n\nAs a side note, I wonder if your sister would complain about the day care/preschool of she found out one of the teachers didn't finish highschool", "nta", "NTA. If anyone has grounds for giving advice against homeschooling it\u2019s you. I guess I understand some parents considering it because of all the bullying, fighting and of course mass shootings happening EVERY DAY in America but all you\u2019re really doing is delaying the real world and probably under preparing your child for it.", "NTA. Your sister didn\u2019t even finish high school. How is she going to provide your niece a quality education? The points you brought up are also good.", "NTA- you\u2019re speaking from your experience which she should take to heart. Also, she dropped out in grade 10? Did she ever finish and her her GED? How would she feel if her daughter\u2019s teacher didn\u2019t have an education? And not saying your sister isn\u2019t intelligent due to dropping out, but maybe she won\u2019t be able to handle the pressures of teaching and staying on the curriculum. I know I would not be able to teach math \ud83d\ude05 I also hate training new employees because I struggle to explain things well and go all over the place.", "NAH. You spoke from your experience. But it depends on how she homeschools. My cousins were homeschooled and they\u2019re incredibly successful academically, professionally, and personally. It\u2019s about the kid, how the schooling is approached, etc.", "NTA. I am even more concerned that your sister didn't even finish high schooling and wants to home school your niece. I'm educated with a masters degree in law, but I would be totally useless in teaching maths and science subjects. Especially maths. It's not a reflection of anyone's intellect or ability. But a child is taught by different teachers in school for a good reason", "Borderline YTA cause its not your kids, not your life and you don't know what your sister is planning. Who knows? Since you both been through it, maybe she's better at it? There could be OTHER reasons why she might want to home school and to be frank, but at college(uni), some of the best performer were home schooled and they're better socially adjusted.  \n\n\nI can understand your concern though, but this is your sister's life and you gotta let her live it. End of the day, you interfere, she's going to blame you if things goes south", "I'm gonna go against the grain here and explain why YTA in this situation.\n\nHow you feel about your own experience with homeschooling is totally valid and I think you are well within your right to blame your anxiety issues on the lack of social experience. Fundamentally, you are right when it comes to yourself.\n\nHowever, none of us know the future: you can't predict how homeschooling will affect Addie and Lily. You also can't predict how school might affect Lily. Is Addie really going to ***ruin*** Lily's life by homeschooling her? That's up to Lily to decide.\n\nThe decision here is not only Addie's to make, but it's *entirely* Addie's responsibility and she can be the only one to take the blame for it. Addie is totally right to be pissed off at you for trying to 'influence her parenting decisions' because that's exactly what you were doing and it's wrong. You want her to make a certain decision and you are pressuring her into it instead of helping her make a decision that she is comfortable taking responsibility for. Addie **needs** to be able to make decisions according to what she feels is right, whether or not you feel like it's wrong.\n\nWhat you *should* have done is share your own experience without judging Addie's ability to make a decision in order to help her make a more informed choice.\n\nI get that this is something you feel very strongly about, but it will help you grow as a person and fix your relationship with Addie if you: apologise, tell her that you understand now how you were being an asshole to her by trying to pressure her into making a decision, that your personal negative experience with homeschooling still causes you pain and that in order to make things right, you'll be willing to stick by her and support her either way.", "I think your AH status depends on exactly what you said, how you said it etc. Was your sister asking for you input or advice? Did you frame it as \u201cwell this happened to me have you considered this?\u201d or did you go straight for \u201cno, don\u2019t do that you\u2019re going to fuck up your child\u201d? Are you close with your sister and do you often have Frank and open conversations with each other? There\u2019s nowhere near enough context here. \n\nI personally wouldn\u2019t want to homeschool, but I\u2019m not against it in all cases and I know perfectly well balanced people who have been homeschooled and enjoyed it. That\u2019s not to take away from your experience, and there\u2019s definitely a big risk with homeschooling that you can mess your kid up if you\u2019re not very careful and deliberate about socialising them properly.

If that\u2019s the case then NAH, just two people feeling some feelings. \n\nMaybe try explaining to your sister why you reacted the way you did, apologise if you offended her and tell her that you want the best for your niece and explain your reservations about homeschooling in the calmest way that you can.

The best you can do for your niece is to help influence your sister to make sure that she socialises her daughter well.", "Im gonna say NTA for voicing your concerns but i will also say public school can be just as traumatizing and mess the kid up just as much.

Some days she would take us out for a couple hours for a piano lesson, or some meetups with other homeschooled kids. And my siblings and I were well ahead of others our age as far as schooling.

I love my mother. I got a full ride scholarship at a local college. I make 6 figures at 22, and am arguably doing very well for myself. If I had the chance to go back and attend public school for my highschool years, I would take it in an instant.\n\nPeople don't think of all of the opportunities that homeschooled children miss out on. The highschool classes that give you college credit. Learning to study for tests. After-school activities. It puts you at a very real disadvantage, even when everything is done right.\n\nHas your sister considered how difficult it is to teach an older child things that she herself has probably forgotten? I know absolutely nothing about chemistry, US history, anatomy, and geography. I didn't have those classes, because my mom didn't know how to teach them. I taught myself math, and learned English through excessive reading in my younger years. \n\nAnd then there's the socializing aspect. I don't care how many homeschooler groups you attend with your child, that doesn't make up for the sort of socialization you receive in public school. I can almost always spot a fellow homeschooler from a mile away. Why? Because their social skills are very obviously stunted. I was much less independent than my peers at 16. Extremely socially anxious and depressed. I worked my fucking ass off to become a functional human, and I am just now beginning to see an improvement. 6 years later. \n\nDoes your sister plan to have more children? What will she do if one of her future children is born disabled in a way that takes up a significant amount of her attention? This was the case in my family, I was basically neglected from the age of 12 on. Any school I did was up to me. No one checked in, no one had the time. My parents are wonderful parents. They were doing their best. The situation was outside of their control. Has your sister considered the variables that may affect her ability to teach?\n\nHomeschooling is extremely under-regulated in the US. I have personally seen many cases of neglect that are only able to happen because the child is homeschool. Homeschooling laws open the doors for religious extremism, indoctrination, and abuse. Homeschooling should only be considered a viable option on an extremely case-by-case basis.", "NTA homeschooling is always a mistake and should legit be illegal. Basically intellectual footbinding. Never known a kid who came out the other side happy and well adjusted.", "Your sister homeschooling could be vastly different than your experience with homeschooling. There are so many resources now and also co-op/charter schools that combine homeschooling and on-site education. Projecting your experiences is unfair to both your sister and your niece. While I sympathize that you had a tough time, your sister is not your parent, (she did not homeschool you so you should not project your parents lack of insight or failures on her ) nor are you your nieces parent- so it is up to your sister to decide what is best for her child. Many people decide to homeschool during the early years, to ease transition into being apart from parents for longer periods of time. Also, with the ridiculousness teachers are being forced to teach children now a days perhaps your sister is just being selective on what your niece is exposed to at an early age. Just because she decides she wants to home school now doesn\u2019t mean that will always be the case. But if it is there are plenty of curriculum and resources available to her.  Your parents should have helped you with socialization- and I\u2019m sorry they did not have you interact with more homeschooling kids as this would have helped you in later years. \nWe moved quite a lot during my children\u2019s school years and they finished middle and high school at a charter school where it was a hybrid of homeschool and in class setting. They were also able to take any class at the community college for free with dual credit. Able to participate in sports, dances etc. Readily accepted into college. My son even graduated high school 1 year early because he could take extra credits and not be tied down by the emulate school constraints. He also traveled for his sport during school as well.\n7 of my nieces and 1 nephew also homeschooled. They are doctors, nurses, computer engineers, teachers, physical therapists - successful, well adjusted. \nPlease do not shut down homeschooling because it was no successful for you. It is not that case for everyone. \nWhat you could be doing is supporting your sister, and encouraging her (instead of shaming or deflating her) to get involved in support groups /homeschool co-ops that can help her and fill in gaps that she may need help with.  You could share your experiences, but in a kind way. \nAlso info: your sister dropped out of high school at grade 10. Why? Surely it wasn\u2019t because high school was so amazing that she wanted to stay? Did you ever think that your sisters schooling experience was less than ideal as well, so she is choosing a different path for your niece? \nMaybe she is attempting to limit her exposure to drugs, bullying, violence, exposure to sexuality at a young age etc. \nalso a lot of public school time spent now is spent on disciplinary issues, standardized testing, and there is a ton of wasted time and very little learning. Your niece may actually thrive being homeschooled. By projecting your experience on your sister and saying that she is going to mess her daughter up is where YTA. Your sister is not your parents. Your niece is not you. Be supportive, or don\u2019t say anything at all.", "Home schooling now is different than what it used to be. Now, with the internet, there is plenty of curriculum to make sure the kids stay on track. Also, with social media, it is much easier to get together with other homeschool parents for clubs and field trips.\n If she isn't a motivated person who is willing to take her kids to do things with other homeschoolers or make it interesting, I can see why you'd be concerned. \nMy kids are homeschooled and it was life changing for the better.

You\u2019re also acting like your anecdotal experience is the be-all end-all, conflating correlation and causation, and dismissing that many people including your sister had difficult experiences in traditional education. You also persisted with your case even after your sister was clearly uninterested in your opinion. I don\u2019t think your sister should homeschool barring additional information such as a medical need, but your approach was immature and ironically supports your argument that you personally are still a bit limited in your social skills. A better approach would be to cite broader experiences of homeschooling and best practices for how to avoid some common problems. \n\nYour sister may very well be TA towards her child for providing a limited education but there\u2019s not enough info to say and that\u2019s not your question anyway.", "YTA, that was your experience and what you wanted.

The bullying, neglect from the teachers and the way-too-quick and forced emotional maturation is something I'd never wish on a child. I know how important socializing is, but there's no way a kid can grow healthily from that. At least in my opinion.\n\nAt the end of the day it's her kid and you're giving your perspective as somebody who was homeschooled. I think your sister should consider that and it's not an ah move to tell her, but don't expect her to simply listen to you because you've been homeschooled. She simply knows the shit side of public school. Imo, if done correctly it's better to homeschool, but even if it's not like that for you she could use some insight from you to make sure she doesn't fuck up. Some sort of collaboration in order to plan this in a way that makes the child and their mother happy.", "YTA. You didn\u2019t just give your opinion you told her she would ruin her child\u2019s life - That\u2019sa major pronouncement, and frankly unlikely to be true. \n\nHomeschooling didn\u2019t work for you. Maybe your life is ruined. Maybe you have good reasons for advocating for traditional schooling.\n\nBut traditional schools don\u2019t work for a lot of children. \n\nDid you even have an open conversation about why your sister is looking at homeschooling? Did you talk about what homeschooling approach she was looking at? It\u2019s not that you shouldn\u2019t share your opinion - but you shouldn\u2019t do so the way you did. \n\nI\u2019m not a homeschooling advocate. But a colleague of mine homeschooled their children. School wasn\u2019t working for one of their kids - they could not work with his disabilities properly. School was ok for the other - but not amazing. \n\nAcademically they did better homeschooled. They belonged to a network and did shared lessons as well as individual. They had regular contact with other kids. They did a lot of excursions / guests etc to bring in expertise they didn\u2019t have. They had art classes with artists, science classes with scientists. \n\nFor those who don\u2019t understand homeschooling - it\u2019s a common approach in places with genuine remoteness. It\u2019s simply ridiculous to expect a 5 year old to travel for 3+ hours a day to attend school. Older kids might travel or board (live at a school)- little ones far less so. I think homeschooling is far more common for little kids than high school. \n\nWe have both homeschooling and distance education (school via internet, previously radio). Distance Ed remains reliant on parents teaching the kids with some support from a teacher. Not that different to homeschooling through a program. Kids I knew that did primary years through distance Ed usually did about 2-3 hours of school a day - and spent the rest of the time playing or helping out around the property. With just a small group of kids - they covered the material quickly.  It takes a lot more training to teach 30 kids than to supervise lessons for a few.", "Gently, YTA. Your experience is relevant and certainly shared by other homeschooling graduates. But it is not the only one and, especially now that there are so many online communities with live discussion, plenty of homeschooled kids have access to social experiences and advanced class work in school as well as extracurricular activities.

The cards originally said not for use as identification and what not and was only meant to keep track of people for tax reasons. Why does it get used in a way that it completely is not meant for? Because States rights of course. Obviously we can't have a federal ID! That would be crazy! So instead when people realized that everyone had a SSN (well, almost everyone, some people managed to carve out exceptions for themselves), they started using that and nope, totally not a federal ID, don't mind me while I cover my ears and close my eyes while loudly shouting \"NaNaNaNaNa can't hear you\".\n\nAnyway, education is another hot topic which I suspect won't ever be cleared up until most of the top positions are populated by atheists.

The diplomas are worthless because it's nearly 100% graduation rates with a ~75% literacy rate\n\nNow the state is considering a voucher system that will come out of the education budget, further reducing the funding, further increasing the incentives to just pass kids along, and ignore discipline.
