I am sorry for those kids who make fun of you.", "yk, if she is doing this because she wants you to get better at the language so that you can have an easier time adjusting to Canada, I can understand.\n\nBut from your description, she seems to be doing this out of insecurity and herself  of feeling left out. You are his daughter, you and your father will always be connected through blood. She is different, and it gets further enhanced at times like that. \n\nIn terms of her learning Czech, I don't think it should be compared to you learning Mandarin because it is incredible difficult for most older people to learn a new language.

Whenever you guys speak Mandarin with each other, I feel equally left out and so I've already been studying a bit of the language just so that I can feel like a part of the family more. But my native tongue is still very important to me, I don't do this to make you feel left out, I just want to feel more comfortable when talking instead of translating things in my head.

You've even made attempts to learn Mandarin and she doesn't seem to be interesting in learning how to pronounce your name?\n\nIt's more about her being uncomfortable not understanding what the conversation is about and maybe a fear of being insulted and not understanding. She's never thinking about the times you don't understand the Mandarin conversations and just have to sit there oblivious, she's only thinking about how uncomfortable it is for her to finally be in the position of not understanding a spoken language.", "First, Czech is a beautiful language so keep speaking it every chance you get. \n\nSecond, it\u2019s a parents responsibility to nurture a relationship with their child and not the other way around.

Nothing wrong here. \nAnd just keep going. The part where you have to translate everything is the shittiest part, but it will go away some day. What did the trick for me is reading out loud. Mostly when I was alone in my room where noone would hear me, but the written words gave me the needed guidelines that I only had to concentrate on the speaking part. It probably sounded horribly, and was kinda creepy, me sitting alone in my room, reading childrenbooks or texts i found online out loud. But eventually i got so much training that today I can switch between my mother tongue, german and english without bigger problems, and also sometimes think in english.

Its incredibly hypocritical of her to speak mandarin around you but expect you not to speak your own native tongue with your own dad. Has your dad sided with her?!?

To toss off a few\u2014 law, business, academia, science, diplomatic corps, etc.\n\nI guess my current advice would be to take the hard path and attempt to learn two new languages but maybe offer to teach your stepmom Czech in exchange for Mandarin lessons.  It would be good teaching experience, maybe bring you two closer, and give each of you a chance to understand more about your original cultures. Win-win all around!", "NTA for sure. But I would like to add that you should let your dad and possibly your step mom that you feel isolated when they speak mandarin around you.
