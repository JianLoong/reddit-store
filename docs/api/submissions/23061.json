When I came here, let me tell you that my English was horrible, my accent was very strong, and it was one of the reasons why I didn't make much friends at school, since they made fun of me for sounding Russian, and because my name was difficult to pronounce (and also because it apparently sounded Russian aswell). \n\nIn Canada, I never got to speak my native language anymore, and I was at a point where I felt like I had no community and was very isolated.  Unlike writing and reading, speaking english was uncomfortable for me,  I always had to translate everything in my head, and it still sometimes came out wrong, I also felt bad about my accent. The only person I could comfortably talk to in czech was my dad, who was mostly at work, and due to the major time difference, I could barely talk to my friends back in Czechia.\n\nMy stepmom is chinese-canadian, and she speaks mandarin with my dad, so I never really understood what they were saying during dinners, and we live in a chinese dominated neighbourhood, which I dont mind, but whenever we would get invited to things in our neighbourhood, 90% of the conversations would be in mandarin, and I could never join the conversations and spent my time sitting alone. Because I wanted to do something about it, I started learning mandarin while still working on my english, which isn't ideal, but I wanted to try atleast. \n\nNevertheless, with my dad I always speak czech, its the only time I can actually talk and be comfortable, not having to repeat everything three times in my head before saying it. Ive noticed that this bothers my stepmom, since she doesnt understand us, however,  shes fluent in mandarin and english. She has never really made an effort to even learn how to pronounce my name correctly, let alone pick up a few phrases. Last week, we the 3 of us went out for dinner, I was talking with my dad in czech and telling him about school and the usual, then my stepmom snapped at us and told me she cannot understand what Im saying, and  I should speak english at the table and at home. I told her that english is difficult for me to speak, and with the one person I can comfortably talk to is my dad, and that she will have to deal with me refusing to give up speaking my language .

What is she worried you might be saying? if she can speak Mandarin around you at dinner, you can speak Czech. Ask her why she is paranoid?", "ESH. She shouldn't be excluding you from conversations at home, and you shouldn't be excluding her. You can speak with your dad when it's just the two of you, same way that she should. My family speaks our native language at home whenever my sister and I come visit, but all of us switch to English the moment our English-speaking husbands enter the conversation.\n\nThe community events have nothing to do with her, but I get that it's rough to be so alienated at something meant to foster community. I am sorry that you're feeling very alone. I too moved to Canada as a kid and had to pick up English, with my native language only being spoken at home and with no cultural community around me. Have you tried finding an online community with a voice server you can join?\n\nMost importantly: where is your father in all this? His wife shouldn't be excluding you from conversations at home and he should be on top of making that known. This shouldn't be a fight between you and your step mother, it should be a conversation between your father and your step-mother.", "ESH.\n\nSpeaking Czech is understandably important to you, and the only person you can speak it with is your Dad. So you should absolutely speak Czech with him at home.\n\nBut you had gone out to dinner, as three people. The only language all three of you share is English. (You don't speak Mandarin, she doesn't speak Czech.) So table conversation at a meal for three people should generally be in the common language. \n\nSo I'm rating both of you the AH, but I think she's worse, 'cause she's the parent and you're the kid, and because she needs to make space for you and your Dad to have conversations in Czech.", "ESH. You should be able to speak your native language with your father, but while out to dinner with the 3 of you is NOT the place to be doing that. So what, she just sits there in silence while you two have a conversation? And she sucks for doing the same when you guys are all 3 together.", "NTA \n\nif your step mother is fluent in English, maybe you two should start learning based on the other's knowledge? You can teach her some phrases and her you? \n\nIt might help bridge the gap between you both by showing you are wanting to communicate with her in a way everyone understands. \n\nI've never learnt another language, so I can't tell you it's easy, but having support and being able to communicate comfortably is something everyone deserves.", "ESH.\n\nYour stepmom because she\u2019s a hypocrite as she talks her language with your dad all the time.\n\nYou know how you feel when she does that or even when you struggle with English and yet you do it yourself.\n\nEnglish is my second language too and I live in America. I found my best friend here who\u2019s also Dutch and yeah we talk Dutch together but not non stop in front of others. Sometimes the odd words, like last week she was sitting next to me at a dinner with friends and we all talk English but when everyone was looking at menu/deciding what to eat we quickly chatted in Dutch on our choice.\n\nBut no, we wouldn\u2019t have a full on conversation in Dutch at the table and exclude others.", "ESH. At the dinner table, everyone should be speaking the same language. It's just rude not to. I put more blame on your step-mom since she should know better.\n\nOtherwise, it's great to speak to your dad in Czech.", "ESH, especially your father, who excludes other people regularly.  It\u2019s just as rude of you to speak in front of her in a language she doesn\u2019t understand as it is for her to speak a language you don\u2019t understand in front of you.  Stick to English when she is around.", "YTA\n\nIf you can speak a language everyone can understand at the table then you should. Doing otherwise is rude or disrespectful. You know how she feels about it and you simply don't give a shit. \n\nIf I was a step parent, I'd be treating you the same way with any boundries you set, I'd trample all over them.", "NTA. It\u2019s how you best communicate with your father", "NTA. She's a hypocrite.", "Welcome to Canada! I truly hope you settle in and feel more comfortable. \n\nAlso, NTA. Keep talking Czech to your Dad.", "NTA", "Definitely not asshole. Deep down she probably just feels excluded. But if she did this to you and is now say you can't that's messed up. If this is your best way of expressing yourself you should do this. On another note, maybe it would be more caring to speak a language you all understand when your all conversing at the same time. And speak your native tongue with your father alone.", "NTA. \n\nYou are in your home and speaking to your parent. She is happy speaking English or Mandarin regardless of the comprehension level of everyone in the room, she can deal with a third language being thrown around. \n\nHow is your father managing this? Has he tried to intervene, or is he just letting it play out?", "NTA and boy howdy, if she wants all English, she better apply to that to her ENTIRE LIFE not just times when she is with you and your father. I get that it can come off as rude to speak another language in front of some one but clearly she has no problem with doing that to you.", "NTA, stepmom is a hypocrite.", "NTA. \n\nSo it's fine for your stepmother to speak Mandarin and leave you isolated and left out, but you speaking to your father in your native language is unacceptable, because...? Oh, yes. She doesn't understand, feels isolated and left out.\n\nPffft, you're not wrong. \n\nSpeaking a new language is tough. I applaud you for making the effort.

Just like your dad obviously did learning 2 other languages.", "NTA for insisting on speaking your own language with dad.
