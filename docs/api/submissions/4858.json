This dog really falls foul of the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991. It's a ticking time bomb waiting to happen and the bf will wonder why he's been sent to prison if the dog he's clearly failed to train in anyway mauls or kills someone", "This comment is pretty dumb. It shows a lack of understanding of humans history with dog domestication and the inability to do a bit of research before making a point. \n\nEvidence of Dog domestication goes back 14,000 years although evidence of what's called 'proto-domestication' dates back around 35,000 years. During that 21,000 year period Humans were living alongside, hunting with and giving scraps to literal wolves.

Who else would qualify for a council house nowadays?", "Exactly a staffy can be a great dog but you have to train imediately from day one", "Anyone can apply for a council house, there isnt a \"qualifcation\" However demand far outstrips supply, so people are triaged based on need\n\nSo homeless families, familes about to become homeless, people with disabilities which are being worsened by their current home, people downsizing from a large council house to a smaller one (because this frees up a large one for someone who needs it) all get higher priority\n\nYou generally get banded as gold, silver, or bronze and within in that you are assigned a number on the list. Each week social housing for your area is released and you \"bid\" on properties. As a general rule the person with the lowest number whos needs are met by the property gets it. It doesn't always work that say, but that's the norm in my experience\n\nOf course these days Bristol is taking over 6 months just to read applications and band them. So anyone who isn't high priority had no chance.", "Indeed, though a dog is as only as good as its owner. If it's not toilet trained etc it's clearly not been taught how ever. Staffys are very loving and intelligent dogs they need the exercise (probably not getting it due to owner blaming the aggression) and stimulation. If not they can like all dogs and divert that frustration into other things that are destructive/aggressive behaviours", "Hello neighbour :), I live near Cardiff. Thanks for the explanation! In my understanding it is still benefits, especially when only high priority applicants have a chance, but of course I might be wrong.", "Look at the \u201ccategory of dog\u201d section https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fatal_dog_attacks_in_the_United_States", "It seems to be total bullshit. A source I can find on dog attacks in the US between 1982 and 2021 put the Bull Terrier  (nothing differentiating Staffordshire Bull Terriers) at number 42, well below other breeds such as the Poodle, German Shepard, Beagle, Collie and many many more.\n\n[https://petolog.com/articles/dogs-attack-statistics.html](https://petolog.com/articles/dogs-attack-statistics.html)", "https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fatal_dog_attacks_in_the_United_States", "The problem with this is they go by what the victim says the dog breed is.
