He has never lived with small children before and I will have to watch him every second, of every day for the entirety of my baby's life. Not only that,  but this dog will destroy all my new stuff in the house (he has destroyed my couch, and ripped/bitten wood doorframes etc in our current house) and leave piss/shit everywhere, inside and in our little garden.

It should have been euthanised after biting family members. Not the dog's fault but it's owner.", "NTA. That dog sounds absolutely atrocious.  If your boyfriend wants to keep the dog he can fork over the money to stay where you're currently at while you take the new safe home for you and your child. If my girlfriends dog did that and she wouldn't get rid of it I'd definitely get rid of them both.", "Info: what's a council house?", "NTA\n\nHis dog is not trained and he is a danger to people and animals. It's very sad to have a pet you feel unsafe around and that should never be the case. Your boyfriend should have taken his dog to a specialist and trained him with help a long time ago. It is so unacceptable to have a pet and just let it do whatever it wants even when its hurting other animals and people. \n\nIt is definitely NOT safe to have this kind of dog around a newborn. Even the most gentle dog needs to be slowly eased into a new baby but a dog like this needs basic training first and maybe it will never be gentle enough to trust around the baby.

Just a second of not paying attention can cost your babys life", "NTA.\n\nA dog like that would by law be euthanized in my country.\n\nThis monstrosity needs to stay as far away from your baby as possible and your man did a horrible job of raising it.
