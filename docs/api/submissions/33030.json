Welcome to the USA.\n\nThe only way it would be if it was harassment, which wouldn\u2019t involve the FAA.", "Dude, I'll be fully honest, that is the dumbest thing I've read in a long long while", "Legally once your told to leave someone private property,  the moment you refuse to you are trespassing.\n\nYou leave the property and call the police to retrieve your items(sometimes with the police by your side as you do it,  other times the police will get it for you, as your wait of property)", "Yup. Got a problem and call the cops? Now you got 2 fucking problems.", "This exists in the US too. If you can't tell you're on private property and don't return once you're given notice, trespassing won't stick. The whole blocking/retreiving the drone piece may have some bearing, but I doubt it, from a general trespassing standpoint, getting trespassing to stick can be hard to do.\n\nThere is a separate issue of privacy and airspace. It's considered an invasion of privacy to video or photo someone without their consent, which the OP acknowledged was alleged later, no real insight why these women thought this, also makes me wonder if the crash was less random than described. I don't know flying regulations, but several who claim to have knowledge in that space seem to be indicating the operator of the drone has a higher duty relative to airspace than the general tresspass laws, and that's plausible, I don't know thos laws and regulations to argue either way on that.", "omg, like, have you heard of walls having windows!? it's almost like those are clear walls!!\n\nI've also never heard of neighborhoods having similar floorplans, it's not like someone could take pictures of a house, look through past/present real estate listings of similar floorplans, to find an entire layout of a house; right? that's not at all possible...", "In most jurisdictions you can go on to non fenced private.property to retrieve your own property and the land owner is obligated to give you back your property on request.\n\nThe home owners should have given OP his drone and told him to leave.", "Generally speaking it is not recommended to prevent someone from leaving a property you claim they are trespassing on, though asking for their name to have them formally trespassed from the property by the police may be a good idea. Citizens arrest doctrine varies heavily by jurisdiction, in some areas it is only permissible if you witnessed a felony or a violent offense so without knowing where this was I can't really comment on if that's a good idea.\n\nAlso one of the initial factors of trespassing tends to be having 'legitimate business' on the property and at least in my state entering a property to retrieve personal items which are thrown, fallen, strayed, or blown on to private property is not trespassing.", "I don\u2019t know if you read the whole thing, but it says flying low over someone\u2019s private property can land you in legal hot water. You\u2019re only allowed to fly a drone 400 ft AGL and if I can spot a drone 0-400 ft above my property, I can file a complaint with the FAA. In my state, you\u2019re not allowed to fly a drone AT ALL over anyone\u2019s private property without authorization from the property owner FIRST. This goes for a lot of states within the contiguous US. \n\nYou\u2019re arguing with the legality of privacy over PRIVATE property. I can guarantee you that if someone reports you to the FAA for flying a drone over their private property without authorization, you won\u2019t be just doing whatever the hell you want. Good luck.", "What crack are you smoking and how can I avoid it", "1. This isn\u2019t the \u201clegal technicality\u201d sub. \n\n2. If someone\u2019s stuff accidentally winds up on private property and the property owner, instead of allowing them to retrieve it, claims \u201ctrespassing!!1!l\u201d and tries to bar retrieval, then the property owner is being TA and can get in the sea for all i care. The person trying to retrieve their misplaced item should get it and depart. Involving the police is a waste of public resources.", "I am so sick of people saying to be apologetic when theyve done nothing wrong.  NTA", "Google street view provides all the shit you\u2019d need to get started.  And the situation you describe just further proves my point that drone footage isn\u2019t the problem, there\u2019s so many ways.  And if all of a sudden someone was casing the neighborhood with a drone it wouldn\u2019t go undetected, people have zero idea how much they are being watched and it\u2019s not by the guy with a drone", "Entering over the objections of the property owners who are present absolutely will be trespassing, and they can most likely use force to prevent you from doing so.", "I think it's too late for you to avoid smoking crack to be honest....", "I mean, you're pretty good at seeing things from OP's point of view. What about the property owners? How do they even know this is OP's drone? It's a big property, maybe they thought it belonged to another member of their household. Or - as many, many have said - maybe they thought he had video looking in their bathroom window or of them sunbathing. There are dozens of possibilities. When you don't even have the first clue if you're over or on private property, and you don't even know the laws in your state surrounding drone use in state parks, and you admit to after the fact doing the exact thing the property owners were concerned about, you lose all benefit of the doubt.\n\nOP, YTA.", "Actually, it would have been extremely easy to prove you weren't a pervert. Just show the footage.  Unless you are a pervert and the footage would show that.", ">The ONLY 100% effective way to de-escalate the situation was to leave.\n\nI agree with this but at the same time you also need to be 100% sure you are on public land and don't trespass.", "Never said he was TA. But tresspassinf is absolutely something wrong.", "I won't argue that there are many violations of privacy out there; but that doesn't mean that people, or women, should become complacent and, when faced with something that makes them uncomfortable (clearly this situation did by the homeowners reaction) just say \"ok, well, I guess this happens a lot, so, okie dokie!\"\n\nliterally this is how \"and then they were murdered' stories start", "No he hasn't committed criminal trespass. Why is anyone up voting something so clearly wrong?\n\nWas OP trespassing? Yes.\nWas it criminal trespass? Absolutely not. That would minimally require no trespassing signs or a fence that OP ignored and in a number of places it requires you to actually damage property.", "The code for my state says very clearly that entering to retrieve personal property is not criminal trespassing, if you have voiced your intentions to retrieve your property and are shot for doing so here the person who shot you is the one who has broken the law. Of course these things vary by jurisdiction though so I can't say if OP was criminally trespassing or not.", "They didn't call him a pervert until after, having got in an argument over trespassing to the point the police were called HE THEN USED THE DRONE TO WATCH THE WOMEN POINT THE DRONE OUT TO THE POLICE. How is that not malicious spying on the women?\nSo, not the AH for leaving, but absolutely the AH for pushing further into the property having been asked to leave, and especially for sending the drone back.", "It is if you get all your information from entertainment tv", "How do you know that's someone's yard without signage?\n\nYou need posted signs to tell the difference between a park and someone's yard?", "no it doesn\u2019t, and you\u2019re conflating deadly force with \u201cforce\u201d", "yeah, my husband works in law enforcement, and I work for the court system. pretty sure I'm not \"getting all my information from entertainment tv\", but from being exposed to the worst kinds of people available.\n\n\"worst case scenario\" isn't reality all the time, or even most of the time. but we don't have fire detectors as regulations for all the days peoples houses don't catch on fire \ud83e\udd37", ">You need posted signs to tell the difference between a park and someone's yard?\n\nno, I need signage (or a fence or some other kind of barrier) in order to know that I am not allowed to go on that property. \n\nno matter if it's a park where I am not allowed after dark, or someones front yard that isn't fenced in... \n\nif there is a locked or closed gate or a sign saying I'm not allowed I know I am not allowed to be there, if there is not, I don't know....", "b. \u201cTrespass\u201d shall not mean either of the following:\r\n(1) Entering upon the property of another for the sole purpose of retrieving personal\r\nproperty which has accidentally or inadvertently been thrown, fallen, strayed, or blown onto\r\nthe property of another, provided that the person retrieving the property takes the most\r\ndirect and accessible route to and from the property to be retrieved, quits the property as\r\nquickly as is possible, and does not unduly interfere with the lawful use of the property.\n\nCrazy how I know what the law is where I live and you don't.", "That actually explains it, everything is criminal to you people", "So you just assume you have free reign to wander around anyones yard at all, at your leisure, if theres no fence?"]}
