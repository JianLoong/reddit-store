A few days ago we were sitting on our rootftop drinking wine after the kids went to bed. Lindsay was admiring the view and made a comment about how much our apartment cost (James must have told her), and asked if my name was on the deed. She then said \u2018half of (X amount) penthouse just for lying on your back? S*x work is way more lucrative than I thought\u2019.

I felt bad for ruining James and the kids\u2019 trip but both my husband and I were too angry to have Lindsay there. \n\nThe next morning, Lindsay asked if she could stay. She said James wasn\u2019t willing to end the trip early and wanted to stay but she couldn\u2019t afford to stay in a local hotel. She blamed her comment on the wine but her apology/explanation seemed so insincere and was clearly based on having no choice.

James then said he wasn\u2019t paying for her hotel because it was her own actions that got her kicked out, and she would have to fly home early and he\u2019d fly back with the kids as planned, which is what happened.\n\nLindsay has since laid into me over text and social media for forcing her to go home early without her kids.

Her salary or his?\n\nOne of the problems with 50/50 when one partner makes significantly more is that the partner with the higher salary rarely wants to live within the means of the lower one. So, for example, James might insist that they can afford a big house, so he refuses to live in a small apartment. But Lindsay has to pay 50% of the mortgage that\u2019s 3x the rent of the apartment. Or James picks an expensive restaurant, complains when Lindsay doesn\u2019t want to go, and she\u2019s stuck paying for a 50$ burger.

What a trash comment to make about someone...", "Yes, that is the only piece that niggles at me. I'm trying to figure out what exactly she has to pay for. Is her money for clothing, selfcare and treats or did she have to pay for her roundtrip ticket before they left and any meals they eat out? If it's the 2nd and he's making her use her entire salary for all of her needs with nothing left to save, her nasty comments make her jealousy understandable, though still not forgivable.", "Yes, I\u2019m shocked there\u2019s so much sympathy for this man.", "i was wondering if 25x was a typo, like maybe 2.5? bc that's a ridiculous difference, how much does SIL make?? and if it is 25 the brother is an ah on principle, even if SIL is s jerk and/or it was a mutually agreed upon policy. \n\nOP, NTA. SIL needed to go. no matter what she thinks/believes, she was rude af for no reason or fault on OP's part.", "[deleted]", "He doesn't have to pay for anything just because he makes that much more. It's nice if he does but he's not obligated too. Kids together married or not.", "The comment you're replying to is saying the SIL should take it up with her husband, not with OP. She's mad about having to go home alone and saying that if OP kicked her out she should have kicked them all out. The commenter is pointing out that nobody forced her husband to watch her leave on her own, he did that because he also had enough of her shit, and that's between them. SIL is trying to make it out like OP turned him against her. That's not what happened.", "> \"Both my husband and James laid into her for the comment\"\n\nI'd say he had OP's back at the time of the insult rather than merely not making a remark about OP.\n\nKudos to James for dealing with it as he did, especially as she's likely going to be an absolute thundrcunt about it once he and the kids get home.", "We do know the husband makes 25x the wife's salary, but insists on splitting the adult (non-kid) expenses with her 50/50. Let's not all rush to make this man a victim here.", "She's not happy with her arrangement w James at all, and she's also an AH for taking it out on OP instead of letting James know what's up.\n\nSeriously, what kind of love does this man really have for her, he makes more than double her salary and begrudges the mother of his children any generosity or security. \n\nIn my life, that would never do. I work, but I make less than the man in my life. If he expected a 50/50 split all the time, he'd never have gotten past a 2nd date.", "Don't you find it odd that James defends his sister for being a SAHM /W but he makes his own wife pay for everything herself? Maybe Lindsay is bitter about the double standard.", "In that case, he is punishing her and that is abusive. Spouses are not children or pets.", "This 100%. Yes, the SIL was rude and out of line but him making 25x more and still making her support herself is crazy. I\u2019m so curious what the numbers are\u2026 does she make only $10k and he\u2019s bringing in $250k or is it $50k and $1.25mil?? Either way, the money she makes should basically be \u201cfun money\u201d for the family because a drop in the overall bucket.\n\nSo yes, she lashed out at OP but her issues clearly lie with her own situation and that she\u2019s jealous of the support OPs husband provides. My husband makes more than me and also pays more of our expenses. I\u2019m confident that is he made 25x what I made he\u2019d let me do whatever the f I want. In the end I feel bad for SIL, her husband doesn\u2019t support her financially or in any other way as is evident by him sending her packing on her own", "Where are you getting the 50/50 thing from?", "People are calling James an AH outside of this incident with OP. Because he is. SIL is incorrectly redirecting her frustration with her husband onto other people, which we all know is wrong. However it\u2019s easy to sympathize with her when she\u2019s drank whatever koolaid her husband is feeding her to think splitting bills when when they have that large of a financial gap is a good idea. Hopefully after this incident she wakes up and realizes that most marriages are like what OP has\u2026 different contributions that are equal all the same.", "I thought jealousy too. Whether Lindsay wishes she could be a SAHM or she's jealous OPs husband is happy to shoulder all the financial costs, idk. But I get the feeling her attitude stems from jealousy.", "Where did you get this idea? Wild speculation?", "Oooh, that's an angle I didn't consider!", "I love plot twists. \ud83d\ude0b", "But they have kids. James likely does not have a flexible job so Lindsay has to pick up the slack. While childcare exists you still need a parent to handle drs appointments, sick days, monitor homework, etc. does she do more work at home with no benefit? If so that sucks.", "No, he's not legally obliged to, I guess, but it doesn't mean he can't or that he's not an ah", "Yep, classic case of Redditors debating something because they don\u2019t realize they\u2019re in agreement.", "[removed]", "Agreed I would seriously considering leave the SiL if I were James though she sounds unbearable.", "Op also says that James has said op shouldn\u2019t have kicked lindsay out. It sounds a lot like James is saying one thing upfront, and then the opposite behind op\u2019s back.", "Not only that but the husband willing to travel with his two kids alone... his wife has put him through some shit to have him prefer that compared to traveling with her help with the kids", "ESH you should have made your brother leave too. He sounds like a real AH and how he treats her is likely where her resentment for you stems from.", "Agree. I think James is very likely also a gigantic asshole and this outburst from Lindsay is their awful financial dynamic spilling over onto other people. But in this specific instance, Lindsay was an asshole to OP and James wasn\u2019t, so I still think OP was good to kick Lindsay out but not everyone else. No need to pretend James is a martyr though.", "Since Lindsay seems to have no verbal filter do you really believe she wouldn't tell any and everyone how mean James was being to her? Willing to bet Lindsay has done something that gave James the upper hand in their relationship.  Does that make him the controlling AH? Maybe,  maybe not.", "This woman protests too much, she's the sex worker with eyes on the 25x salary prize. Problem is, he's on to her.", "We don\u2019t know what actually happened in their relationship. Someone even suggested Lindsey might have made more than James when they initially got together and demanded separate finances. But things got much better for James and he stuck to their original agreement. \n\nJames is a vindictive AH and so is his petty wife. They deserve each other.", "Again. We don't know how this started. As someone pointed it out, Lindsay might have earned a lot more in the beginning and was adamant about separate finances, but now that James makes a lot more, she could be salty about it.\n\nMaybe she is insistent on paying her own way, but now it's more about pride than actually wanting to. She could want it like OP has it, but her need to prove a point comes first.\n\nMaybe she was shown to be completely irresponsible with money (whether making unnecessary purchases or giving out loans to friends and family, without checking with James first), so James said \"you can do what you want with your money, I'll pay for the kids and me, but that's that\".\n\nMaybe James actually is an Ah. \n\nMaybe this marriage is actually shot, but they stay together \"for the kids\" and put on a show in front of acquaintances about some semblance of a relationship (didn't quite work out in this case).\n\nJames might think that OP and husband do their thing, while not wanting a similar way of life for himself. People can recognize that people might have different ideas about life than they do.\n\nWe don't know why they chose this. But it is not the question, either.\n\nJames has the right to defend his sister, whatever the reason.", "He still pays for the household expenses. So he is spending on her too. He just won't spend on anything extra she wants for herself. It's one way to do things. You join your joint expenses but keep your personal spending seperate.", "I have a hard time ever sympathizing with grown up people taking out their frustration with others, especially going overboard as much as she did. Telling someone that the Only reason her husband gives her money is Cause she lays on her back alot? Thats automatic lifetime ban from my life, bye bye.\n\nI have zero empathy for her \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "Seems like he\u2019s very literally not her bread and butter as he refuses to support her financially in anyway? She should blast him, too.", "Do you not think James is saying the same thing to Lindsay in private? Why should I pay for you? You're just my bed partner.", "Exactly.\n\nThis was misplaced anger from Lindsay.\n\nAnd it's her husband's focus on what Lindsay does /does not bring to the table and focus on the chance that Lindsay is using HIM that's the root of this.\n\nI really don't get the idea of not pooling resources to at least some degree in a marriage where the earnings are this disproportionate\n\nWhy be a couple is you don't want to enjoy things as a couple?", "Honestly he sounds like he's financially abusing her. It absolutely doesn't excuse her but I really think they should have asked the whole family to leave especially when James handled it like he did. This doesn't sound like an agreement between equal partners to split finances. It sounds like a domineering partner making 25 times his partner's salary \"splitting\" everything 50-50 so he has opdles of savings and she has nothing and remains fully dependent on him while he is free to do whatever", "James is the telling op financial business. While not helping his wife with anything.  Who do you think?", "That's why there's a \"collapse thread\" button!", "No, it\u2019s clearly a case of Redditors being quick to jump the gun and argue even though they\u2019re saying the same thing.", "I kind of agree, but less for this (as he's right, it WAS her own actions) but more for the weird and obviously uneven splitting of finances.   \n\n\nIt just seems...weird. Like, what happens if they get divorced? I feel like Lindsay could get really screwed here.", "[removed]", "[removed]", "Oh yeah, Lindsay was an AH in the interaction with OP, and OP doesn't have to take her shit, whatever its source. \n\nIt was just all the \"oh poor James\" comments.", "Wait what, \"someone suggested\"?? I thought we were gonna go on just thr info provided by the post. No reason to bring every random speculation to the table like it's relevant.\n\nThat being said, yes, Lindsay and James are not looking too good. I tend to side w the woman, having dated a very controlling and stingy man for way too long. Never again.", "That doesn\u2019t negate James being an AH, lol. Imagine being a millionaire and your spouse makes 50k and you make them pay for their keep in a marriage. Absolutely bonkers and smells like financial abuse. That\u2019s why people are calling James an AH too.", "If he makes 25x her salary, she very likely lives in a beautiful home with lots of other perks. IMO, she should really just hush because her mouth has caused a whole lot of problems for everyone.", "Did you just not read the post?", "He kept the kids with him. Just the wife flew home.", "Nah James made his bed when he chose Lindsey. Thats on him. But i dont think he should have to pay for her nasty attitude either. Shes not happy but thats not something she should take out on op.", "You\u2019re the one that speculated James is stingy for not paying for everything his wife wants.", "I think that the SIL, knowing their relationship, was wrong to say that to OP and kicking her out of the house was not out of line. BUT OP has stated in other comments that she assumes her brother would have Lindsay pay at least a portion of the home bills. If that is reality, Lindsay is contributing to a beautiful home that is so far beyond her means that she can\u2019t afford a few nights in a hotel room. \n\nI\u2019m a SAHM, I have made jokes about earning my keep by being good in bed because I\u2019m secure in our relationship and my contributions to the home. I *do* talk to my husband about some purchases - think things like laptops or designer shoes. I have a SAHM friend who was shocked when I said I would talk to my husband before agreeing to a girls weekend away. Every relationship is different and I think *some* of Lindsay\u2019s previous questions about \u201casking permission\u201d were not asked maliciously", "That's not speculation. We KNOW James doesn't cover his wife. Just the kids. And we KNOW the wife resents it, and is taking it out in the wrong direction. People who earn well and treat their wives like roommates who split the bill are indeed stingy. \n\nHere's where I will speculate. Is there perhaps some reason Lindsay is afraid or feels unable to address James directly about this. Maybe he's a mean one in addition to stingy. Maybe not. I'm guessing.", "You're looking for abuse in a relationship that you have read a few sentences about to justify your nosiness.\n\nThinking that your feelings are facts and that you are entitled to insert yourself into someone elses marriage because it doesn't look right, in your opinion.\n\nYou're doing exactly what Lindsay did to OP!\n\nNobody is entitled to opinions about other people's marriages. Lindsay needs to learn this and you do too!", "NTA - your brothers family finances are none of your concern, just as yours are not her business.\n\n**She seems to be upset because she thought at some point being married to your brother would afford her the opportunity to live the life you are. That\u2019s not the case, so wine + envy has her trying to put others down to lift herself up.**", "I get it. I\u2019m used to calling out family members for their actions but yeah, not everyone does that.", "But she's being financially abused!  He's not your husband,  he's your brother.  You don't just \"not have an opinion\" on your siblings being abusers.  I'm a SAHM and I feel way more for your SIL than you.", "Ya, if it was an attempt at conversation at the check out, than sil sucks at conversation, BUT that is not what OP is describing. OP has had to deal with what are obviously 'judgement' comments and not an actual conversation starter."]}
