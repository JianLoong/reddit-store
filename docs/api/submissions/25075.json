James is married to Lindsay (35) and they have two kids, 4f and 2m. I invited James, Lindsay and the kids to visit me this past week, and they were meant to stay until next friday. \n\nLindsay and I have always got on fine, except for the fact that she\u2019s always had a weird attitude to me being a SAHW/M. She always asks me if I\u2019m going to ask my husband before making non-essential purchases, or asks me if I feel bad relaxing while he\u2019s working, or suggests I do things for him as a \u2018thank you\u2019 to him since I\u2019m apparently not doing anything else. I know that James and Lindsay are big on splitting costs and while he pays for everything for both kids he won\u2019t pay for Lindsay, despite making about 25x her salary. Being that that\u2019s the relationship they\u2019re happy with, I just roll with the comments because my marriage must look weird to Lindsay. \n\nHowever, there is a line. A few days ago we were sitting on our rootftop drinking wine after the kids went to bed. Lindsay was admiring the view and made a comment about how much our apartment cost (James must have told her), and asked if my name was on the deed. She then said \u2018half of (X amount) penthouse just for lying on your back? S*x work is way more lucrative than I thought\u2019. Both my husband and James laid into her for the comment, I was obviously furious and told Lindsay first thing in the morning she had to get out, she wasn\u2019t staying here after speaking to me like that, especially when she wasn\u2019t even apologetic. I felt bad for ruining James and the kids\u2019 trip but both my husband and I were too angry to have Lindsay there. \n\nThe next morning, Lindsay asked if she could stay. She said James wasn\u2019t willing to end the trip early and wanted to stay but she couldn\u2019t afford to stay in a local hotel. She blamed her comment on the wine but her apology/explanation seemed so insincere and was clearly based on having no choice. I told her this and said even if she did mean it, I just needed some space from her and didn\u2019t want her around after what she said because when put on top of what she\u2019s been saying for years, it\u2019s obvious that\u2019s what she thinks. James then said he wasn\u2019t paying for her hotel because it was her own actions that got her kicked out, and she would have to fly home early and he\u2019d fly back with the kids as planned, which is what happened.\n\nLindsay has since laid into me over text and social media for forcing her to go home early without her kids. Both my mother and James\u2019s have said I was wrong for kicking Lindsay out. James\u2019s mother said I should have just let her stay for James\u2019s sake and not invited them back. My mother says I should have kicked all of them out because now Lindsay has to be away from her kids.

I have joint accounts, people ask me if we ask each other permission to buy stuff as it's not just mine or his money.\n\nOf course if people don't want to discuss it I don't. But from what you said you never said anything against having those conversations.", "Oh yeah it could go either way. To be honest my first comment was under the assumption the brother had been annoyed as I misinterpreted OP\u2019s post. \n\nIn any event I think it\u2019s James decision not to leave that could be debated moreso than OP, who I think was justified. That decision is then entirely down to their relationship with each other and with the kids. I\u2019d have left with my wife and child, but I appreciate others wouldn\u2019t in that situation and it\u2019s not clear cut."]}
