A few days ago we were sitting on our rootftop drinking wine after the kids went to bed. Lindsay was admiring the view and made a comment about how much our apartment cost (James must have told her), and asked if my name was on the deed. She then said \u2018half of (X amount) penthouse just for lying on your back? S*x work is way more lucrative than I thought\u2019.

I felt bad for ruining James and the kids\u2019 trip but both my husband and I were too angry to have Lindsay there. \n\nThe next morning, Lindsay asked if she could stay. She said James wasn\u2019t willing to end the trip early and wanted to stay but she couldn\u2019t afford to stay in a local hotel. She blamed her comment on the wine but her apology/explanation seemed so insincere and was clearly based on having no choice.

James then said he wasn\u2019t paying for her hotel because it was her own actions that got her kicked out, and she would have to fly home early and he\u2019d fly back with the kids as planned, which is what happened.\n\nLindsay has since laid into me over text and social media for forcing her to go home early without her kids.

It says Lindsay pays for Lindsay. Since she equates SAHM/W with sex work, she may feel herself superior to OP. So, since she would rather be at work than at home, maybe James feels she should pay for herself.  In which case her superior attitude and big mouth created a bill for Lindsay that Lindsay has to pay.\n\nAnd the moms should keep their opinions to themselves. No one should have to put up with this kind of rudeness from a guest in their home. NTA, OP!", "The half brother pays for himself and the kids, she only has to pay for herself. Her arrangement is more than fair, she\u2019s just an AH.", "Maybe he is financially abusive. Not enough info to tell. Maybe his wife early in their relationship made a HUGE deal out of splitting bills equally and isn\u2019t mature enough to talk to him openly about money now.  As her maturity is obviously lacking, I would need way more info before blaming the husband. \n\nI say this because early in my marriage I made a huge deal about contributing equally with my husband.  Well his salary increased rapidly and mine didn\u2019t (worked for a nonprofit).  Eventually he sat me down and told me he didn\u2019t think it was fair to burden me when he made more than double.  We came up with a plan that worked better.", "We're not privy to the inside details of their marriage (either couple) but perhaps BIL has a reason for his attitude; I've been around several marriages where the wife was on a strict budget because of overspending and credit card debt. Not coincidentally, the husbands acted about like BIL in those cases. One of those husbands found out he was liable for 5 cards that he never knew about.", "If someone makes $30k a year and their spouse makes $750k, obviously they'd be paying for the kids. Making the wife pay for herself in all ways isn't equitable and isn't healthy. I'd say the same thing if the genders were reversed or it was a gay marriage.", "If he makes her go 50/50 when their income is 25/1 then I don't know how anyone could think that's fair. Separate finances are fine, and refusing to bail someone out when they're a dick to the host is fine, but there's no way their marriage can be considered equitable.", "In a marriage with the mother of your children, yes.    Gender isn\u2019t part of the argument so it\u2019s anyone\u2019s duty who makes the substantive amount in a marriage. It\u2019s about equality vs equity.", "You work as a team when you marry. I bet she\u2019s doing things he isn\u2019t paying her for like childcare, house keeping, etc. it\u2019s literally called financial abuse. But hey good luck to you if you marry.", "Imagine making a milion + a year and forcing your wife who makes 50k a year into a 50/50 split of finances LOOL.\n\nThe guy is a massive asshole.\n\n\nIts no wonder SIL is a bitter woman.", "But she said he makes 25x more than Lindsay. That\u2019s a lot! Lindsay asks OP about spending her husband\u2019s money on non-essential purchases, asks about how she\u2019s saying thank you, she doesn\u2019t have money for her own hotel\u2026  it seemed pretty obvious to me that Lindsay has no money after she pays her share or that Lindsay has to ask about every non-essential purchase and make sure she thanks properly. Then she comes with this attitude\u2026. Situation feels really icky to me.", "She needs to leave. She\u2019ll be much better off with child support!", "Not to mention she doesn\u2019t have a hope in hell if she tries to divorce.  This is the definition of financial abuse. She\u2019s pointing the hate in the wrong direction, but she\u2019s being abused.", "That\u2019s not financial abuse. She also stated that he pays for everything involving the kids. She only has to pay for herself. You\u2019re deliberately misrepresenting the situation.", "He pays for all the cost of the two kids. So by her own thinking she too is lying back in bed and getting her half of the kids costs covered...", "Why is your brother so selfish about money tho? Big wtf. Hes an huge asshole. No wonder your SIL is so bitter.", "Lol I don\u2019t have the restraint to be petty. I just cut you out or I go scorched earth to the point where we can never make eye contact again because of the level of things that have been said. I don\u2019t have a \u201csmall payback\u201d mode. Wish I did", "THAT\u2019S NUTS! OP has no control over how her brother acts OR how he chooses to control his finances OR his relationship with his wife. Other than what OP has stated, none of us know the SIL. She could be a gold digger or a shopaholic and this is James\u2019 way of keeping her in check. But from her snide comments, I think we can all agree that she started this mess with OP and must now live with the consequences. \n\nI make 5x what my husband brings home but we have always had joint accounts and can trust that neither of us will make foolish financial purchases. Anything purchased over $200 is discussed prior, this works for us but every relationship is different.", "I agree with this. OP isn\u2019t an AH for the specific thing she asked, but she is an absolute trash person for allowing someone to be abused (based on the comments, at least).", "Making questions? No, SIL made snide remarks\u2026BIG DIFFERENCE! While I choose to work, I understand that being a SAHM/W is NOT someone sitting on their ass doing nothing! OP is managing their home, taking care of their children, and taking care of 1000s of little chores so her husband doesn\u2019t have to worry about them. Personally, I would rather work in an office! Lol", "BOTH Mums!!!! Which is kinda shocking", "I think James sounds like a bit of an AH to Lindsay, tbh. Not for this, this was a fair consequence of her actions, but for seemingly refusing to pay for ANYTHING for his wife when he makes 25x her salary.", "Exactly. He was probably tired of her shit and relieved she went home.", "He didn\u2019t, read the text again he wasn\u2019t willing to pay for his wife\u2019s hotel because she had herself to blame for this. He didn\u2019t make a single remark abou OP according to OPs story.", "Well op is the one that kicked her out. Who knows how she is treating the husband at home. We dont have that info only how she is treating op.", "I mean would you want to leave with someone who attacked your sibling like that? Id be disgusted if that was my partner.", "He loves his kids.\n\nNot so sure he still loves his mouthy wife.", "The part where he calls OP a trophy wife and the part where he forces a 50/50 split with his wife while hes making milions of dollars while shes making mid 5 figures maybe?", "If im making a milion a year and you are making 50k a year and im forcing a 50/50 split while we are married. Would you call that toxic?", "This exactly!!\u2019", "The real question is: do they live within his means or hers? If it\u2019s the former, there\u2019s likely an aspect of financial abuse, intentional or not.", "I\u2019ve seen first hand how women who have supported their husbands careers by staying home with their kids are discarded and there\u2019s no way I\u2019ll ever willingly become financially dependent on someone else (and will encourage my kids not to be).", "In a way I agree, but I think we have to remember that the wife is not paying for housing, utilities or food.", "To be honest, based on OPs comments/SILs behavior, I doubt he makes 25x her salary. Even if she's working minimum wage he'd be making 300k+, and I highly doubt she's making minimum. I think 25 was either for hyperbole or not realizing the math", "I doubt she\u2019s paying for those things alone from what was originally stated. It seems more that she pays for her own personal expenses out of pocket and all other household related expenses comes from him. That seems fair. Now, if that\u2019s not the case, then yes, that\u2019s not okay\u2026 but from perusing comments and reading the og post, it does seem like James is fully paying for all household related expenses.", "I am married. Happily so. My wife is a SAHM. I pay for literally everything, but we have a joint account that she has full access to.", "Remember James pays for everything, except for the wife\u2019s spending. That means she gets free housing, utilities and food.\n\nWhilst I still don\u2019t think it right, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s as bad as you imply.", "He pays for both kids alone.", "The brother pays for everything involving the kids. She only pays for herself.", "He\u2019d get the kids with that pay gap.", "Lol I don't think he has to pay child support for stepkids. If he's not on the birth certificate, he's probably off the hook. \n\nShe might get some alimony though, depending how long they've been married.\n\nEdit: they're not stepkids, they are bio", "The house they live in and the mortgage they pay: is it based on the 25x salary or the 1/25th salary? If it\u2019s the former, it\u2019s unfair to make her pay 50%. If it\u2019s the latter, it\u2019s fine.\n\nSame for eating out. Does he choose restaurants based on her salary or his? Vacations. Her salary or his?\n\nOne of the problems with 50/50 when one partner makes significantly more is that the partner with the higher salary rarely wants to live within the means of the lower one. So, for example, James might insist that they can afford a big house, so he refuses to live in a small apartment. But Lindsay has to pay 50% of the mortgage that\u2019s 3x the rent of the apartment. Or James picks an expensive restaurant, complains when Lindsay doesn\u2019t want to go, and she\u2019s stuck paying for a 50$ burger. And so on.\n\nThe only time 50/50 is not highly questionable, if not straight up financial abuse, is if the couple lives within the means of the lower earner. Otherwise it\u2019s the higher earner making financial decisions (because he can afford to) and the lower earner is constantly playing catch-up for those decisions.", "[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15w7o31/aita_for_kicking_only_my_sil_out_which_meant_she/jwzn5v6/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=1&utm_term=1&context=3)\n\nShe probably has to pay some expenses. So her money clearly isn\u2019t just hers.", "I did see that in a comment afterwards, but it\u2019s still too vague as to \u201cpay for herself\u201d.  Does she have to pay for her own share of the bills? Does she have to buy her own food? Does he actually pay for all the kids expenses like clothes, supplies, daily travel, or does he just pay the big amounts like daycare?\n\nI\u2019ve asked for clarification and am happy to modify my stance if I receive it. If her money literally just pays for her expenses then it\u2019s not necessarily financial abuse, just a really shitty relationship. \n\nIt also annoys me that you\u2019re happy to nickel and dime the SiL, when on that basis what she said about OP is true. OP doesn\u2019t have a job. Without a ring she would be known as a bang maid\u2026", "Except when they are out she spends her own money on her own card.
