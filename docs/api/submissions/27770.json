He attends college and pays for most of it himself, like tuition, food, apartment rent etc. though he gets some help from family. He also works a part time job. However, it sometimes is not enough, and he asks to borrow money from me sometimes. I do not mind this, and I know he has a lot of expenses and works hard. However, he does not like to pay me back. What he'll do is spend the money he would've paid me back on things like taking me out to eat, which I feel is not the same, because some of it is being spent on him too. I pay most of the time when we go out since I also work and have more savings than him, so he says its like he's saving me from paying. \n\nWhen he asks me for money, he always says he needs it for rent or food, which he did about a week ago. I gave him almost 200$ which he said would be paid back to me once he gets his check. He said he only had 30$ for food for the rest of the month, so I gave him an extra 20$ along with the rent money to try to help. But when we were playing video games today, I noticed he had bought a new skin that just came out, which costs I think 25$. He did not try to hide it either, as he had it equipped for everyone to see. I immediately noticed and commented on how he was just begging me for food money only to spend it on a skin. A couple of his friends were also playing with us, and they agreed with me that he needs to get his priorities straight, and my boyfriend stayed pretty quiet for the rest of the gaming session, as well as giving me the silent treatment when I tried to talk to him but responding to the other guys. Later he texted me that he was angry I embarrassed him in front of his friends and that I was a bitch. He defended himself over text saying how he should be allowed to buy himself things, and I responded, \"yeah but not with my money that you said would be spent on groceries\". \n\n  \nI think I was justified in confronting him, though maybe I should have talked to him about it in private, but I only did in the moment because I felt hurt and shocked. It was reassuring to hear his friends agree with me though. None of us were even being mean either, just saying he shouldn't have done that and moving on. AITA?

Tell him you're not comfortable with this anymore and you want your money back in cash or bank transfer nothing else. And that he should ask his parents or something. When you get your money back dump him. He has shown that he has no respect for you and tried to cheat himself out of his debt and lies to you on how he spends his money.
