My dad and my older brother both died in the accident. My mom, younger brother and I survived. Three years later my mom married Daniel. He was divorced with two grown sons. To me Daniel was always my mom's husband, not my dad or a parent. For this reason, when I got engaged, I decided not to have Daniel act as a parent of the bride in my wedding. I asked my brother if he would dance with me in dad's place and he accepted. I'll be walking with my fiance down the aisle. My mom is shy and we had talked about her dancing with me also but the spotlight just on the two of us was a bit much and since my fiance's parents are divorced, and he didn't want the drama of dancing with just his mom (and he doesn't want to dance with his stepmom) we decided we'd get the parents dancing with their spouses. Since mom said there would be more people in the spotlight that worked for her. We also decided to have the spouses walk in together at the start. So Daniel would be walking with my mom and dancing specially with her. When this was brought to him he was unhappy. He asked about a special dance with me and I told him that wasn't something I was okay doing so I wanted to find something for him and mom to do. He said I am making it very clear that he's being thrown in just because and if he can't walk me down the aisle, then at least he should be given a father/daughter dance. I told him he's not my father and I was dancing with my brother in honor of my dad. Mom told him it was a happy compromise. He said it wasn't. He asked if money was the issue and would I include him if he paid for the wedding. I said no. I told him we had it handled. I asked him to sit on it and think about it. A week later he came back to me and said to me that I need to find a better way to include him because this is not enough. I told him if he doesn't want to walk with her and share the dance with her than he can do nothing, because he is not going to walk me down the aisle or have a father/daughter dance with me.\n\nHe told me I'm being an asshole and making it clear he's not wanted. Mom told him to calm down and that they even get to help pick the song. He said the song he wants is one for him and me and I am crushing him by refusing.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1673608753, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10as3ce/aita_for_telling_my_moms_husband_he_walk_with_mom/", "score": 483, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And it is your wedding, you decide what you want to do and happen there. He is your moms husband and therefore part of your family, but he is not nor ever will be your father.

You lost your father, but that doesn't mean he can just claim he was there to replace him.", "NTA\n\nDaniel is definetly the AH here to me it seems like he always wanted a daughter to walk to the altar.", "NTA and its worse because he thought he could buy his way into it.\n\nAs soon as you said your brother was doing it **in honour of your father** he should have accepted it. He's an AH for pushing you on it and trying to guilt you into it.", "NTA...your day, your way. Frankly, I think you've planned it in a very thoughtful and balanced manner. Daniel trying to buy his way in is very discomforting. Congratulations on your upcoming nuptials.", "NTA- your wedding, your choice it is that simple.

You've been very fair and it's your wedding. Great your mum is being supportive of you. I would un-invite me at this point. Also as someone who lost her father as a child I think having your brother walk you down the isle and dance with you is a beautiful tribute and something that will be a special memory for you both to treasure.", "NTA, Although he cannot be blamed for wanting to be included, it is clear that he cares about how you view him. He can however be blamed for how he goes about that. Calling you names and trying to push you to further include him is not the way to go, and you are well within your rights to not include him. \n\nIf you want to de-escalate the situation, you could offer him further compromise, but you are under no obligation whatsoever to do this.", "NTA\n\nNo-one is entitled to any sort of role in someone else\u2019s wedding.

I am so glad your mother is on your side and not trying to force you to change your mind. Do your wedding your way. If Daniel doesn't like it, tough. As someone else pointed out, he has sons so probably sees this as his only chance to be \"father of the bride.\" But he's not your father, he's not a father figure, he doesn't get to demand that he takes on this role.", "I can sorta understand his hurt feelings since he did help raise you for a number of years and probably expected/looked forward to doing \"fatherly duties\" at your wedding. ***BUT!*** You have made it clear that this won't happen & why, and how the wedding is planned is up to you (and your fiance, of course). Your mother is right, it's a happy compromise (it really is, OP) and it's one YOU chose for YOUR wedding. None of this is about him, and he needs to back off. I suppose, if you have time, you could try coming up with a \"small but special moment\" to share with him but do not give in about the aisle walk & dance, especially if you're not comfortable with it. **NTA**", "NTA. It\u2019s your wedding. You\u2019ve outlined your wishes. Daniel needs to back off and respect them.", "I say NTA, but here me out: \n\nIt's your day, about YOU, your fiance, and your love; and you can have things as you want. For sure. I think it would be understandable that you perhaps MIGHT feel like no one can fill your father's spot (which is true) and that it wouldn't be right for anyone else to do his duty of walking you down the aisle. I'm not sure what your feelings/thoughts are on why you don't Daniel to walk you down (other than he's \"not your father\"), but I am just saying, that part doesn't make you an ahole. There are legit reasons for not wanting that.   \n\n\nBUT, I do think that your post sounds a bit dismissive toward his reaction and feelings on the issue. And I'm not sure, obviously, what's been said and hasn't, but father or not, he has been with you, it sounds like, for a long time, helped raise you, etc. And he sounds like he sees you as his own. (again, not sure, but it sounds that way). And perhaps it stings a bit for him because he's played the \"dad\" role and he cares about you and it seems like you're not acknowledging that or returning that sentiment.   \n\n\nAgain, just throwing stuff out there to maybe help...And maybe offer different views/perspectives. But, you obviously don't owe anyone a spot or role in your wedding because it is YOUR day and it should be perfectly how you want it. People can hope on board or they don't have to...Simple. Simple.", "NTA-I\u2019m so sorry OP. You don\u2019t deserve this treatment from Daniel. He is definitely the AH. Plus, how horrible does he have to be to make demands when he isn\u2019t even footing some of the bill? That\u2019s ridiculous. He should have been fine with this regardless of the finances. Instead, he\u2019s trying to buy his way in. He should be thankful that you\u2019ve been so considerate on how everyone can be special. Your poor mom-the rejection must be awful!", "NTA.", "NTA - Its your wedding , Daniel cant force anything", "NTA\n\nHe's a bit entitled, isn't he? Glad your mum is on your side. Stick to your guns.", "INFO: I know you don't feel close to him at all but is your relationship with him actually a bad one or just an indifferent one? If it's not a bad one maybe just consider having a dance with him. It's your wedding and you can do what you want, I don't think you're an AH either way but the guy did step in and help raise you from 11 up. Would a single dance really be that uncomfortable?", "NTA. He's getting no more or less than your own mother. He should get over it. \n\nJust me, but \"I'll save a dance for you\" but not a special DJ announcement, is as much as I would consider wiggling. Because he's a part of your life, even if not the most special part. But then, I'm not a fan of lots of announced dances people are expected to clear the floor and watch, anyway.", "ESH,The real issue here is how your soon-to-be husband's mum is missing out on a special dance with her son to not hurt the step-mom's feelings. That is terrible, tell your husband to speak up and put some boundaries in place with the step mum.

My stepdad was in my life from the age of 5 and I only saw my dad once a week from the age of 2, so you could argue the same in my situation. However my stepdad wasn't interested in having a meaningful relationship with my brother and I so even though he was in my life for 20 years we barely had a proper conversation during that time. The OP has made it clear she's not comfortable having her stepdad fill her fathers shoes so why on earth should she be forced into that position? If it were me I would have found it very uncomfortable and not natural at all.", "This is an appalling thing to say to OP. Saying someone her mother chose to marry after her dad died is more her dad just because he was physically around for longer? You don\u2019t get to decide that for OP.

It's about the perception of the other guests, not the reality of the situation. If he was actually bothered about having that kind of relationship with OP, then he (and every other step-parent who behaves like this with their step-kids) would have focused on actually building a close relationship. \n\nI also feel there's a level of embarrassment. They know they haven't got that close relationship and not being included the way they want to be is proof of that, but rather than apologise or set to work fixing things now, they think if they can wedge themselves into the position that they want, everything will be better. It will undo the past, and they will automatically be proven to be the best step-parent ever. Like, \"See, I wasn't that bad because if I was, why would I be included in the wedding? And if they don't include me, it isn't because I've not been a great step-parent, it's because they want me to feel bad,\" but they never question what they've done that makes them feel bad. \n\nOP does need to have a chat with her mother and Daniel and explain that his behaviour is not going to get him what he wants, but it will destroy whatever relationship they do have right now. This is not his wedding and this is not about him.", "That's fair. I just wanted to give an \"other side\" perspective, so you could see maybe where he might be coming from. But regardless, like I said, it's your day and it should be every bit as wonderful as you want it to be.

I am glad she has someone she found happiness with again but it doesn't translate to him being a parent to me. I was 11 when he married my mom and remembered my dad and he was special to me. Add to that I was a busy kid at that age and Daniel worked a lot. So he wasn't a big part of the picture for me. And he also had two grown sons who were not part of our lives so he would see them outside of us and time spent with them was not with us. But then he somehow expected us to act like they were part of our family, when they, as adults, were not. So he and I butted heads on them. Even more when he wanted us to gives cards for their weddings that we (mom, brother and I) were not invited to. It's not like we even minded not being invited but there's such a weird double standard and it's almost downright insulting to ask others to go above and beyond when the relationship isn't wanted.", "I get where you're coming from. She has stated that they were never really close and have butted heads in the past. Losing a parent (especially as a little kid) can be extremely tough.

Whether they marry your parents or not, there are some people you are close to and some people you just aren't. \n\nWhat's not normal is him trying to make your wedding about him. You've offered reasonable compromises, but it seems like he's hell-bent on pretending to be the father of the bride even though he isn't and has never fulfilled that role. If you two were really close and had formed a father-daughter bond, then I'd understand his feelings (although his behaviour still wouldn't be justified. No means no), but that isn't the case here. \n\nIf you are having speeches, be wary that he doesn't try to do his own father of the bride speech. In other circumstances I'd say maybe compromise and let him do a pre-approved speech, but I feel like if you compromise on that he'd use it to say, \"Well if I'm doing a speech, why can't we do the dance?\"\n\nThere's also a chance he'd go off-script, and you'd have to sit there and grin and bear it whilst he gave a speech talking about being your dad or something similar. I think this is one case where you've offered enough compromises, all of them reasonable, and if Daniel doesn't take them, that's on him. Do point out to him and your mother that his behaviour will not get him what he wants, but if he continues to overstep and disrespect your wishes, it will damage and potentially destroy the relationship you have now.

I honestly feel like it will all depend on how things are over the coming months and whether he keeps trying to demand more.", "I feel like another part of it is how people like to see and expect to see overly perfect families and dynamics. It's seen as the ultimate to have a blended family where there is nothing blended by the end where step, half and other distinctive titles are no longer wanted or used and everyone is just parent/child/sibling/grandparent, etc. Less than that is seen as awful or the worst thing ever. I know a few times I have been told by others it must have been nice to have a new dad after losing mine and they would see it as awful when I corrected that idea.", "That plays into it, and I think it's also them being territorial. The household and everyone and everything in it must be theirs or something is wrong. The family must be perfect and the only way to achieve that is for everything to theirs. \n\nIt's also pride. It doesn't matter if they make the effort or love the kids as their own, the kids MUST love them and want that bond. \n\nIronically, it's these attitudes are what ruin things.

They wanted to have a relationship with just their dad. I met them twice at most, though I think it was only once. We were never really on any kind of terms. I barely know them.

My mom has never met them either. But that's just how things are. Yet he even mentioned that I should invite them to my wedding (and was quickly told it was not happening).", "The people who said that are complete idiots.\n\nSorry for your loss.", "It even works the other way around.
