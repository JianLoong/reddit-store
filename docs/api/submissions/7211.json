My dad and my older brother both died in the accident. My mom, younger brother and I survived. Three years later my mom married Daniel. He was divorced with two grown sons. To me Daniel was always my mom's husband, not my dad or a parent. For this reason, when I got engaged, I decided not to have Daniel act as a parent of the bride in my wedding. I asked my brother if he would dance with me in dad's place and he accepted. I'll be walking with my fiance down the aisle. My mom is shy and we had talked about her dancing with me also but the spotlight just on the two of us was a bit much and since my fiance's parents are divorced, and he didn't want the drama of dancing with just his mom (and he doesn't want to dance with his stepmom) we decided we'd get the parents dancing with their spouses. Since mom said there would be more people in the spotlight that worked for her. We also decided to have the spouses walk in together at the start. So Daniel would be walking with my mom and dancing specially with her. When this was brought to him he was unhappy. He asked about a special dance with me and I told him that wasn't something I was okay doing so I wanted to find something for him and mom to do. He said I am making it very clear that he's being thrown in just because and if he can't walk me down the aisle, then at least he should be given a father/daughter dance. I told him he's not my father and I was dancing with my brother in honor of my dad. Mom told him it was a happy compromise. He said it wasn't. He asked if money was the issue and would I include him if he paid for the wedding. I said no. I told him we had it handled. I asked him to sit on it and think about it. A week later he came back to me and said to me that I need to find a better way to include him because this is not enough. I told him if he doesn't want to walk with her and share the dance with her than he can do nothing, because he is not going to walk me down the aisle or have a father/daughter dance with me.\n\nHe told me I'm being an asshole and making it clear he's not wanted. Mom told him to calm down and that they even get to help pick the song. He said the song he wants is one for him and me and I am crushing him by refusing.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1673608753, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10as3ce/aita_for_telling_my_moms_husband_he_walk_with_mom/", "score": 1763, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And it is your wedding, you decide what you want to do and happen there. He is your moms husband and therefore part of your family, but he is not nor ever will be your father.

You lost your father, but that doesn't mean he can just claim he was there to replace him.", "NTA\n\nDaniel is definetly the AH here to me it seems like he always wanted a daughter to walk to the altar.", "NTA and its worse because he thought he could buy his way into it.\n\nAs soon as you said your brother was doing it **in honour of your father** he should have accepted it. He's an AH for pushing you on it and trying to guilt you into it.", "NTA...your day, your way. Frankly, I think you've planned it in a very thoughtful and balanced manner. Daniel trying to buy his way in is very discomforting. Congratulations on your upcoming nuptials.", "NTA- your wedding, your choice it is that simple.

You've been very fair and it's your wedding. Great your mum is being supportive of you. I would un-invite me at this point. Also as someone who lost her father as a child I think having your brother walk you down the isle and dance with you is a beautiful tribute and something that will be a special memory for you both to treasure.", "NTA, Although he cannot be blamed for wanting to be included, it is clear that he cares about how you view him. He can however be blamed for how he goes about that. Calling you names and trying to push you to further include him is not the way to go, and you are well within your rights to not include him. \n\nIf you want to de-escalate the situation, you could offer him further compromise, but you are under no obligation whatsoever to do this.", "NTA\n\nNo-one is entitled to any sort of role in someone else\u2019s wedding.

I am so glad your mother is on your side and not trying to force you to change your mind. Do your wedding your way. If Daniel doesn't like it, tough. As someone else pointed out, he has sons so probably sees this as his only chance to be \"father of the bride.\" But he's not your father, he's not a father figure, he doesn't get to demand that he takes on this role.", "I can sorta understand his hurt feelings since he did help raise you for a number of years and probably expected/looked forward to doing \"fatherly duties\" at your wedding. ***BUT!*** You have made it clear that this won't happen & why, and how the wedding is planned is up to you (and your fiance, of course). Your mother is right, it's a happy compromise (it really is, OP) and it's one YOU chose for YOUR wedding. None of this is about him, and he needs to back off. I suppose, if you have time, you could try coming up with a \"small but special moment\" to share with him but do not give in about the aisle walk & dance, especially if you're not comfortable with it. **NTA**", "NTA. It\u2019s your wedding. You\u2019ve outlined your wishes. Daniel needs to back off and respect them.", "I say NTA, but here me out: \n\nIt's your day, about YOU, your fiance, and your love; and you can have things as you want. For sure. I think it would be understandable that you perhaps MIGHT feel like no one can fill your father's spot (which is true) and that it wouldn't be right for anyone else to do his duty of walking you down the aisle. I'm not sure what your feelings/thoughts are on why you don't Daniel to walk you down (other than he's \"not your father\"), but I am just saying, that part doesn't make you an ahole. There are legit reasons for not wanting that.   \n\n\nBUT, I do think that your post sounds a bit dismissive toward his reaction and feelings on the issue. And I'm not sure, obviously, what's been said and hasn't, but father or not, he has been with you, it sounds like, for a long time, helped raise you, etc. And he sounds like he sees you as his own. (again, not sure, but it sounds that way). And perhaps it stings a bit for him because he's played the \"dad\" role and he cares about you and it seems like you're not acknowledging that or returning that sentiment.   \n\n\nAgain, just throwing stuff out there to maybe help...And maybe offer different views/perspectives. But, you obviously don't owe anyone a spot or role in your wedding because it is YOUR day and it should be perfectly how you want it. People can hope on board or they don't have to...Simple. Simple.", "NTA-I\u2019m so sorry OP. You don\u2019t deserve this treatment from Daniel. He is definitely the AH. Plus, how horrible does he have to be to make demands when he isn\u2019t even footing some of the bill? That\u2019s ridiculous. He should have been fine with this regardless of the finances. Instead, he\u2019s trying to buy his way in. He should be thankful that you\u2019ve been so considerate on how everyone can be special. Your poor mom-the rejection must be awful!", "NTA.", "NTA - Its your wedding , Daniel cant force anything", "NTA\n\nHe's a bit entitled, isn't he? Glad your mum is on your side. Stick to your guns.", "INFO: I know you don't feel close to him at all but is your relationship with him actually a bad one or just an indifferent one? If it's not a bad one maybe just consider having a dance with him. It's your wedding and you can do what you want, I don't think you're an AH either way but the guy did step in and help raise you from 11 up. Would a single dance really be that uncomfortable?", "NTA. He's getting no more or less than your own mother. He should get over it. \n\nJust me, but \"I'll save a dance for you\" but not a special DJ announcement, is as much as I would consider wiggling. Because he's a part of your life, even if not the most special part. But then, I'm not a fan of lots of announced dances people are expected to clear the floor and watch, anyway.", "ESH,The real issue here is how your soon-to-be husband's mum is missing out on a special dance with her son to not hurt the step-mom's feelings. That is terrible, tell your husband to speak up and put some boundaries in place with the step mum.

My stepdad was in my life from the age of 5 and I only saw my dad once a week from the age of 2, so you could argue the same in my situation. However my stepdad wasn't interested in having a meaningful relationship with my brother and I so even though he was in my life for 20 years we barely had a proper conversation during that time. The OP has made it clear she's not comfortable having her stepdad fill her fathers shoes so why on earth should she be forced into that position? If it were me I would have found it very uncomfortable and not natural at all.", "This is an appalling thing to say to OP. Saying someone her mother chose to marry after her dad died is more her dad just because he was physically around for longer? You don\u2019t get to decide that for OP.

It's about the perception of the other guests, not the reality of the situation. If he was actually bothered about having that kind of relationship with OP, then he (and every other step-parent who behaves like this with their step-kids) would have focused on actually building a close relationship. \n\nI also feel there's a level of embarrassment. They know they haven't got that close relationship and not being included the way they want to be is proof of that, but rather than apologise or set to work fixing things now, they think if they can wedge themselves into the position that they want, everything will be better. It will undo the past, and they will automatically be proven to be the best step-parent ever. Like, \"See, I wasn't that bad because if I was, why would I be included in the wedding? And if they don't include me, it isn't because I've not been a great step-parent, it's because they want me to feel bad,\" but they never question what they've done that makes them feel bad. \n\nOP does need to have a chat with her mother and Daniel and explain that his behaviour is not going to get him what he wants, but it will destroy whatever relationship they do have right now. This is not his wedding and this is not about him.", "That's fair. I just wanted to give an \"other side\" perspective, so you could see maybe where he might be coming from. But regardless, like I said, it's your day and it should be every bit as wonderful as you want it to be.

I am glad she has someone she found happiness with again but it doesn't translate to him being a parent to me. I was 11 when he married my mom and remembered my dad and he was special to me. Add to that I was a busy kid at that age and Daniel worked a lot. So he wasn't a big part of the picture for me. And he also had two grown sons who were not part of our lives so he would see them outside of us and time spent with them was not with us. But then he somehow expected us to act like they were part of our family, when they, as adults, were not. So he and I butted heads on them. Even more when he wanted us to gives cards for their weddings that we (mom, brother and I) were not invited to. It's not like we even minded not being invited but there's such a weird double standard and it's almost downright insulting to ask others to go above and beyond when the relationship isn't wanted.", "I get where you're coming from. She has stated that they were never really close and have butted heads in the past. Losing a parent (especially as a little kid) can be extremely tough.

If he fully understood the situation in regards to your fiance and why you're doing away with parent/child dances for MULTIPLE reasons that dont necessarily center around him, maybe there would be some more understanding. I would absolutely explain that because fiance doesn't want to dance with his mom or step mom, you both collectively decided no parents will be participating in any parent/child dances, and that you dancing with your brother is the best way to honor your late father, and that these decisions are not about HIM but about you and your fiance and how you decided to handle this complicated situation. \n\nI do understand from his perspective that he is probably feeling hurt, but that doesn't negate or invalidate your feelings whatsoever either, and perhaps if he realizes hes not the only step parent not getting a \"special moment\" he would come around. It seems to me a lot of his feelings right now center around not actually having the full context about how you came to this decision. Idk how old you are now, whether or not daniel is otherwise a good man, or how your relationship with him was growing up, but i do encourage you to have a conversation with him one on one, assuming you like him as a person and as your mothers husband, despite not feeling comfortable viewing him as a father figure do to your traumatic experience as a child. Now, if im off base and you don't like him as a person at all, he's abusive or otherwise not a good person and its been a contentious experience, then I'd probably sit down with your mother and have that conversation privately with her to reiterate everything, although i think she already fully understands you. I love how supportive your mother is. She seems wonderful. And hopefully she can get through Daniel's head that choosing to take that opportunity to honor your father is important to you and not meant to be a slight against anyone, but a moment for you and your brother to share that bond and that he really needs to not take it personally. \n\nI could be way off base with the limited info in this post, so to conclude no.

We did our first dance and then partied. \n\nConventions be damned, hold the wedding you want to hold. Do the things you want to do and don't let anyone pressure you into anything.

It's a very difficult situation on both ends. The new partner is walking a fine line in regards to how much they can impose and involve themselves to foster a close relationship, and the children in these situations often are navigating so many complicated emotions in regards to their loss and having a new person in that \"position\".

It's trying to make the bond and get to that end result without putting in any of the work to achieve it.

Life doesn't work that way. \n\nThing is, even if they put in the effort, it doesn't mean they are owed anything. How many people do we see on this sub with step-parents who tried to build a bond their way, irrespective of how their step-children felt about it, and then think they deserve a prize at the end?

OP's mum is clearly in agreement with her, and she clearly sees her husband is being pushy rather than accepting the very reasonable compromises. If he tries to make her choose, I don't think it will end well for him because he is so clearly the one being unreasonable and unaccomodating.", "I disagree somewhat. Step-parents make the mistake of aiming for the mum or dad title and having a paternal or maternal bond, rather than building a bond with the step-child/children and allowing it to play out and become whatever it becomes naturally. \n\nFrom what I've seen and experienced, that still may not end up in being mum or dad or even being a parental figure, but you can end up being like a favourite aunt/uncle or a close friend. But people get fixated on those roles and won't accept anything else. \n\nAlso, OP says they weren't close. People have this idea that a new person can come into the family and everyone will be close, despite the fact that we know there are people on our lives we just don't get on well with, or aren't close with. Doesn't mean you dislike them, you're just two different people that don't fit tightly together, and no amount of effort by either party will change that. You can have siblings you're close with and siblings that, if you weren't related, you wouldn't really hang out with them. It's not a lack of effort or desire for a relationship, it's just how it is. It works in all relationships, both personal and professional. \n\nThey've had their set roles for ages. OP makes it clear that he has always been her mother's husband, nothing more. Now he's pushing to play the role of father of the bride when he hasn't been playing the role of father at all. OP has offered him compromises, but nope, he is insisting he do all the things OP's dad would have. \n\nHe has made this hill to die on, and for what? So he can pretend he and OP are close?

You don\u2019t want Daniel to take the place of your father by walking you down the aisle or dancing with you. Sure, he is your mother\u2019s husband, but you\u2019ve made it clear that that\u2019s all he is to you. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter what he wants, it matters what YOU want. \n\nI wish I would have done some things differently with my wedding. My maid of honor was my sister; and she ruined so many things. I planned and paid for mt bachelorette party. She was our DD and left  me and my friends downtown. \n\nShe got mad at me because I asked her to not wear her bright red glasses during the ceremony or for pictures (because we had blue and cream as our wedding colors). I even offered to get her contacts for the day. \n\nTo top it off, she didn\u2019t get us a gift. My mother actually called me a week before the wedding and said \u201cYou know it\u2019s customary for the bride to get her maid of honor a gift.\u201d  Yes, mom. I know, and I did. \n\nMy sister didn\u2019t get us ANYTHING. My husband\u2019s best man was his brother, and he wasn\u2019t much better, he didn\u2019t get us anything either. \n\nAs soon as the family pictures were taken he went home for HOURS to change and came back in a tank top, a pair of bicycle shorts and flip flops. By the time he got back, half the people had left. \n\nPlease take my advice, and don\u2019t let family guilt make the decisions for you. It\u2019s YOUR day, and it\u2019s your decision.", "NTA maybe time to be brutally honest with him and tell him he is not and never was a father figure to you.

End of story.\n\nBut can I just say that I\u2019m impressed that for once in one of these overreaching stepparent stories to hear that the mom is (at least somewhat) defending her kid and respecting her wishes? Usually the bio parent in these stories goes right along with whatever crap their spouse is trying to pull, even if it alienates their own kid. It\u2019s nice that OP\u2019s mom is at least trying to run interference and and de-escalate/talk her husband back from the ledge.", "NTA He needs to back way off.

He's all up in his ego, thinking he specifically is being shunted off to the side, and not realizing that you've restructured the 'traditional' family add-ins to customize them to you and your fiance's unique situations.

He doesn't  get to dictate the terms of your own  wedding  to you. And he was a dick to exchange  money for him getting  his wife. Do not budge. Maybe  he'll  do you a favor and just stay home the day of your wedding. Who needs that bullshit. Glad your mom sees your side of things.", "you just cannot force a relationship other people don't want. to me it sounds like he is just afraid of losing face at the wedding.

I would actually talk to your mother about this behavior because it is not appropriate.", "It depends on how much he has done for you, and I'm not sure that you you can judge it. If he tried to be a good father to you, and you always rejected him, then it hurts really bad that you reject him AGAIN. \n\nHis question about the money doesn't necessarily mean that he wants to buy him a dance, it can also mean that he still doesn't understand why you can't accept and appreciate his efforts.", "INFO: Was he a good father figure to you growing up? Is the disconnect of \u201cmothers husband\u201d vs. stepfather, even though he married into your family when you were still a child, because of unresolved trauma from your dad\u2019s death, or because of Daniel\u2019s behavior toward you growing up?", "NTA.

Curious what your and \"Daniel's\" ages are. \n\nChildren and teenagers tend to be very hard on step-parents; especially when it comes to feelings that a step-parent is trying to replace a parent. \n\nTypically when people became an adults, especially when they get to the age their step-parents were when they were so hard on them... They realize they're really just people trying to do the best that they could; often in the face of a difficult child that had some trauma to heal from.\n\nSounds like your step-dad loves you and wants to be a part of your life. Is he a replacement for your father? No. Never will be. And I hope he doesn't try to act like it. But I hope you can find your own unique relationship with him, as it sounds like he has cared for you since you were quite little.", "Heck no you are NTA OP, your moms husband has one hell of a stick up his asshole though", "You said he has two grown sons.  So you\u2019re the only \u201cdaughter\u201d.  I guess he always really wanted to have a daughter.  Was he mean to you in some way?  Was he horrible and overbearing?

Did he drive you to places, pick you up and pay for extra curriculars like a Father would? Did he take you on vacations? Did he buy you a car? Not that any of these things make him your Father, but I could understand why he feels so let down and pushed aside.

He has been in your life  since you were 11, and although your age isnt given I assume that will be at least 10 years. You may not see him as a father but if he has been taking on the parental role, including helping to pay for bills and days and looking after you , than he has been a father to you.\n\nYou are not including him in this wedding at all, all he is someone for you mum to dance with so I am not surprised he is upset.\n\nSaying that he doesn't have the right to dictate what you do, especially as I am sure your stance would have not to accept any of his time money or energy since you were 16 and not being a huge hypocrite by seeing him as that when it suited you,", "Not enough information.  He's been a part of your life for a very long time and was probably hoping that you would think enough of him to allow him to walk you down the aisle.  It doesn't mean that he has replaced your father, but that you think enough of him to let him have the honor of that role in the wedding.  You made your feelings clear to him and he is hurt.  \n\nIs that hurt justified?  I don't know because I don't know if he did something to you to make you not have a great relationship or if you are just unwilling to accept anyone as a stepfather.", "I really don\u2019t get the whole \u201cwalk the bride down the aisle\u201d  Its an outdated and misogynistic tradition that some one has to \u201cgive the bride away\u201d like she isn\u2019t her own person.\n\nI got married almost 3 decades ago, and walked my own damn self down the aisle. I at that point in time had 2 degrees and was off to the start of a successful career.  I didn\u2019t need an escort into my marriage.  I didn\u2019t need anyone else\u2019s blessing for this union.  I went freely and happily alone towards my future.\n\nAnd that has been the way it was then.  I was my own self made wholly formed person walking on my own into my marriage.

I concur, NTA.\n\nAs a father myself, the thing to remember here OP is your wedding is a day for YOU and YOUR HUSBAND - the two of you alone make the decisions about how it will go.

Not the worst guy for sure. But we're not close and never were.", "just because he wasn't necessarily mean doesn't make her an asshole for not wanting him to walk her down the aisle or share a dance", "This is the most ridiculous take ever.

Yeah that explains a lot.", "That\u2019s a good point. OP may not have been accepting of a new parent, even if step father had put out genuine effort to be one.
