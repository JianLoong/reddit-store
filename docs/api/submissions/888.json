File the complaint; that\u2019s why the complaint system exists. Just because you report it doesn\u2019t make you responsible for her choices. She got herself in trouble, you didn\u2019t. Adults need consequences too.", "NTA. Im sure her defense will be \u201coh but I\u2019m also (insert race here) so I can say it\u201d. Bull. Report her.", "NTA. I\u2019m a teacher. Yes, report it. You are not responsible for the consequences of her actions, she is.", "NTA \u2018The mere existence of you\u2019? What does that even mean? It\u2019s not your fault or responsibility how she supports herself, it is hers. she should have thought of that before being an AH", "You WNBTA in this case. She's not just an adult harassing a kid, she's an educator whose behavior affects the mental wellbeing of students and sets an example for what behavior is tolerated and acceptable. You definitely should report her. If it was just a bad day or a one off instance, she will not lose her job immediately. But maybe it will be a wakeup call.\n\nI'm sorry she did that to you. It's not acceptable and you do not have to tolerate it.", "NTA- shit like that needs to be reported", "NTA\nBut your teacher sure is. Wow! I don\u2019t know what to say except I\u2019m sorry your teacher did that. You should lodge a formal complaint, they are old enough to know better and it was done intentionally. What happens to them is their fault, do not take responsibility for their actions.", "NTA. If anything, I encourage you to do it so she can be held accountable and you can prevent any other students from experiencing the same from her.", "NTA", "NTA, but don't report her simply because your guidance counsellor told you to.\n\nReport her if you were genuinely upset by it.\n\nShe might lose her job over this, if you think that is a reasonable price to pay, OK, but if not, then maybe leave it.", "YWNBTA - I don't care if she's the same race. Both those comments were extremely racist.", "Report it. She is a teacher. It is a position of authority and this is an unacceptable use of that authority. Don\u2019t feel guilty. If she gets consequences it will be because of her actions, not yours", "NTA", "Fucking make that complaint. No teacher should be doing that to any student. The end.", "NTA. If she didn't want to risk getting fired, she shouldn't have treated you this way.", "NTA\n\nThat's completely inappropriate behavior for a teacher.", "NTA. That was a really shitty thing to say and her being disabled doesn\u2019t mean she can say whatever she wants. It was simply cruelty.", "NTA Words and actions have consequences. If she is old age should have knew that. That isn't something appropriate to say ever and whatever happens it's her fault not yours. If this is something that happens often i suggest you make a formal complain, but if it's first time i might just let it slide.", "NTA, but in what context, did she say that?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But I digress, soft NTA, you'd be well within your rights to file a complaint it was certainly inappropriate for her to say that but I'm a big believer in picking your battles and proportional responses. Perhaps just telling her the joke upset you and you don't think was appropriate for her to say would be the better course and then see if she keeps making jokes like that to you, if she does then definitely report it.", "NTA \n\nLodge that complaint, It's nice that you are concerned about her, that shows you are a good person but what she did was not okay and needs some accountability.", "This right here is all that matter: \n\n> I talked to my guidance counsellor...he said that I should officially lodge a complaint.\n\nYour guidance counsellor knows what he's talking about. He can't lodge a complaint for you because he was not the one experiencing the racism and he didn't see it firsthand, but if he's telling you to lodge a complaint, you need to lodge a complaint. \n\nNTA.", "YWBTA. I realize there is both a language barrier and a culture barrier here, but that single sentence doesnt even make sense. Talk to the teacher.  \n\nI expect to get downvoted because redditors love vengeance for speech crimes.

That's cold coming from the race.", "NTA. You aren't the one causing trouble, your teachers words are.  \n\nIf they're fired, they did that to themselves!", "Not enough info", "YTA.

I felt really horrible as it made me remember other times when stuff like this happened to me and I was upset.

None.

However she does mention 'deportations' alot and when she does she often talks about the students.", "What more context is needed? As other redditors voiced, the teacher should know better than to say stuff like that, even as a 'joke'.", "It's not fine in any context, but if OP said something as outrageous and that was the response I would move to ESH.", "14 year old.... didn't give enough info. Only gave what the teacher said .. loosely ....with absolutely no context. So not enough info to go on. Totally subjective to the 14yr old. perception who can't even give a full account....And let's be honest, reddit readers aren't that reliable to be objective .....", "They are 14. Teenagers say outlandish things all the time because their brains aren\u2019t developed, this isn\u2019t an excuse and there would need to be consequences. But a teacher retaliating with inappropriate comments will never be ok.", "You think a child saying something inappropriate makes it okay for a teacher to respond with racist remarks? ...Seriously?", "She picked on me randomly for no reason, plus I don't act up in class. Even if I did say something outlandish the teacher should know that saying stuff like that is crossing the line", "Again this is your perception of the events and very objective..... you haven't given enough info to make an unbiased yta/nta.... \"she picked on me\" sounds exactly like something a kid would say when whining about school and teachers. \nAre you trying to excuse your own bad behavior by deflecting? \nAgain, there is too much missing info. It would indeed be interesting to poll the class to see what happened. And also get the teachers take..... of course should you choose to complain, and it result in an inquiry, that is exactly what might happen."]}
