That\u2019s theft and it\u2019s honestly just really not cool. \n\nYou don\u2019t need to convince me that airlines freaking suck, but I fly quite often and I see this scenario way more than I want to - ultimately it\u2019s not a secret that this is how the system works and people need to account for that, not try to behave the way they think it SHOULD work. \n\nWhen the airline I fly most changed their policy years ago, I used to always swap with parents who got caught out by it, even if that meant a middle seat instead of the window or aisle I paid for. These days? Nah, that\u2019s how it\u2019s been for at least 5 years, the terms and conditions are clear when you book and I\u2019m not throwing money down the drain playing musical chairs anymore because some people think they\u2019re special and should be catered to above everyone else.", "I do not know.

So, if she get more benefit from a specific thing than I do, I recognize that our family wins. I treat every aspect of our marriage as 200%. Her + Me = 200%. Some times that means I need to give 150% if she only has 50% to give. It is a partnership, and if I can make her feel comfortable, loved and protected, then I win too.\n\nMake no mistake, this woman is not entitled. After 22 years of marriage she knows all about me: I am a pain in the ass, I worry too much about things being cleaned up and tidy (with a five year old in the house!), and I would do anything for my family.\n\nHere is the catch: being in a good marriage and raising a conscientious kid...they won't let me give too much.\n\nSo, no, done right, there is no entitlement to worry about.", "Having travelled with a baby when I was younger I assumed that since the baby would be on one parent's lap thx other parent would take care of the youngster.", "NTA", "NTA.

Like this could have been a connecting flight and the first flight was delayed so they missed their original connecting flight and got moved to this one. Or their flight was cancelled and they go moved to this one. Or they were bumped off the original flight due to over booking and this was the rebooked flight. \n\nIn a perfect world the passenger has 100% control over their seating selection. But we don't live in the perfect world, we live in the real world and while we can complain all day long about people/parents not booking seats in advanced we don't know the truth. \n\nI miss the days when people weren't so dang entitled and society had a bit more compassion for their fellow human."]}
