That\u2019s theft and it\u2019s honestly just really not cool. \n\nYou don\u2019t need to convince me that airlines freaking suck, but I fly quite often and I see this scenario way more than I want to - ultimately it\u2019s not a secret that this is how the system works and people need to account for that, not try to behave the way they think it SHOULD work. \n\nWhen the airline I fly most changed their policy years ago, I used to always swap with parents who got caught out by it, even if that meant a middle seat instead of the window or aisle I paid for. These days? Nah, that\u2019s how it\u2019s been for at least 5 years, the terms and conditions are clear when you book and I\u2019m not throwing money down the drain playing musical chairs anymore because some people think they\u2019re special and should be catered to above everyone else.", "I do not know.

It is a partnership, and if I can make her feel comfortable, loved and protected, then I win too.\n\nMake no mistake, this woman is not entitled. After 22 years of marriage she knows all about me: I am a pain in the ass, I worry too much about things being cleaned up and tidy (with a five year old in the house!), and I would do anything for my family.\n\nHere is the catch: being in a good marriage and raising a conscientious kid...they won't let me give too much.\n\nSo, no, done right, there is no entitlement to worry about.", "Having travelled with a baby when I was younger I assumed that since the baby would be on one parent's lap thx other parent would take care of the youngster.", "NTA", "NTA.

Or they were bumped off the original flight due to over booking and this was the rebooked flight. \n\nIn a perfect world the passenger has 100% control over their seating selection.

You assume they get everything they want. Not the case.\n\nBut if my son is hungry I will give him some of my food. It is what a lot of parents would do. Maybe most. If we are on a subway, I give my wife the one seat. If we were on a plane in this situation I am either going to be less physically comfortable or in the better seat worried about my wife.

Thank god for no-fault divorce.", "Not always.", "And, of course airlines ***never*** overbook flights, either. \n\nSh'yeah, and monkeys might fly outta my butt!", "I appreciate the callout, but not my situation. If my wife was mean/controlling/demanding, it would 100% not be a strategy for success in a marriage. I am not saying it is best, but I view my role as husband and father as both a privilege and a responsibility I take very seriously. And I like giving, I really do, and that permeates my life and how I run my business.\n\nNor am I advocating someone being bulldozed. I also think that relationships are managed and it is always important to ask yourself how much pain will it cause and how much benefit will it cause and make a decision based on that.\n\nIn this case: how much would I care about taking the other seat? In my case, I don't sleep on planes, I have noise cancelling  AirPods, I have my phone, my iPad, and my laptop. I like babies, maybe I ask to hold and help. My wife can't ignore those kinds of things as easily, and needs to sleep. \n\nBut the very important factor is the fallout from the ask/response here. The wife was and is still pissed. That is a pain that is continuing after the immediate situation. She obviously didn't feel protected/partnered-with/taken care or or important. Maybe she is just a demanding creep and wants inappropriate things and he just put his foot down. Who knows. No situation happens in a vacuum, and this situation was obviously influences by every life experience they shared prior.\n\nSo, while NTA, my guess is that in their marriage there is a dynamic that was not considered or dealt with appropriately. Not saying he was wrong, but at the end of the day he ain't happy either. So a couple of hours of less comfort could have saved days worth of agita.", "Or parents need to get proactive about it.  At the earliest possible check-in time, get on the phone with the airline and see if you can arrange adjoining seats.  There are enough \"random\" seats that won't be assigned until check-in, along with all the standby and upgrade passengers, that it's not that difficult to get two or three seats together, it just takes a friendly airline representative to make the magic happen.  Even talking to the gate agent 15 minutes prior to boarding can usually work something out.  It's a lot easier shuffling seats around before anyone walks on the plane.  It doesn't usually take much effort to convince someone in the middle seat in the back of the plane to take an \"upgrade\" to a seat further up front with more legroom.  \n\nHowever, if you wait until you get on the plane, probably in the last boarding group because you bought the cheapest possible tickets, and everyone is already seated, with their bags stowed, belted up and ready to go, and more or less content with their situation, it's going to be a lot harder to find agreeable candidates for relocation."]}
