She tells me that she doesn\u2019t have any friends, and everyone is always throwing stuff at her and calling her names but recently she was pushed down the stairs and she sprained her ankle really bad. \n\nShe was crying about it to me when she was over at my house yesterday and she asked me why I never try and help her out and make her life easier. I told her that I\u2019ve tried multiple times and I\u2019ve tried to teach her how to calorie count, exercising etc but she doesn\u2019t stick to it and I told her that at the end of the day it\u2019s her body and I can only do so much. \n\nShe was upset when I said this and she looked like she was going to cry and I felt really bad, but then she said that her bullying and her weight is somewhat my fault too, since I don\u2019t try and enforce her to pick healthier choices a lot. I was really mad at this point and I will admit I really regret yelling at her but I did. I\u2019ve tried to help her so many times and it was so clear that she didn\u2019t care and I was just so upset about it. I yelled and I told her that her weight gain isn\u2019t my fault and she\u2019s going to have to work something out because I\u2019m tired.

You can urge her to seek counseling; the kind of eating you describe is often rooted in emotional upset. But she can't turn you into the food police, and if you tried to fill that role, that would probably breed even more resentment. Good luck to her and to you.", "NTA you can\u2019t help someone who won\u2019t help themselves.", "NTA- she needs to see a therapist for her mental health and certified nutritionist for her physical health. You are in no way responsible for her choices around food and exercise.

I know some people here are getting on you for your \u201cwording,\u201d but seriously \u2014 it\u2019s majorly insulting to love and care about someone, make a bunch of effort to help them, and then to not only have those efforts not even acknowledged, but to have the problem itself BLAMED on you??? Why should OP have to take that? I\u2019d be very hurt and OP has the right to share his feelings too. \n\nI feel exceptionally bad for this girl  \u2014 being 300 pounds is unhealthy at any age, but I wish she could value you the way she should. It may be that you two are better as friends during this period of her life rather than dating, especially if she\u2019s going to blame her problems on you. That\u2019s a big red flag, even early on", "NTA i don't think her obesity is your fault.

Bullying and overeating is a horrible spiral to be caught in.", "NTA. Obv your choice of words and delivery could\u2019ve been better.

You staying with her will likely burden you with issues which will be enormously distracting in the immediate future.

She needs professional help.", "NTA This is a tough situation. As an overweigh girl for most of my life, I never once felt that my eating habits were anyone else's fault but my own. My guess would be that your girlfriend is hurting and lashed out.

It\u2019s understandable that you were upset after trying so hard to help only to get blamed. \n\nI just wonder if there is more to her weight gain, PCOS or something else? Also there are other ways to lose weight other than calorie counting that she could explore.", "NTA \n\nSomething that I have learned about mental health is that you cannot be the one to \"cure\" the other person. She says she wants your help, but you can't do it for her. She has to do it herself. \n\nI do feel bad for her, though. I didn't have a weight problem in my teens, but now that I'm 40 its a completely different story. I hope she can get the life-long help and motivation that she is going to need to live a healthy life.", "NTA She needs a therapist to help her work through the things that are causing the weight gain and her struggles with sticking to a plan.  As much as you want to help, she had to work this stuff out.

It is possible and read about it. I\u2019ve yet to see it happen. It is only going to get worse.\n\nI would personally move on and not get dragged down by her but I doubt you will do that. (Not because of the weight but because of her blaming you for stuff) Good luck", "NTA.\n\nYou sound like you really love and care for her, and she just seems sad. You just hit your breaking point. It's does not sound like you were mean or especially unkind to her. Sometimes, simply stating the truth, still hurts as much as any lie or cruel joke about her weight.\n\nEven if you were 18 (a legal adult), there is not much you can do besides love and support her. You say she is being bullied, which sucks, but does she have parental support? Friends? Has she had a recent physical?\n\nI'd probably try to talk to her about possibly going into therapy to see what the cause of her weight gain is. She may be overeating to, in effect, self medicate issues/feelings she may be having. It might even be that while she eats she does not have to think about what's troubling as an avoidance measure.\n\nI guess what I am trying to say that this is more serious, than what just one person (you, the boyfriend) can help with; and even maybe herself can deal with.", "NAH I really feel for both of you in this situation. It's a hard position to be in, for both of you. And I have to caution against pressuring her to \"eat right\" and workout. Not because you don't care or aren't coming from a place of love, but it can set you both up for some major failure down the road. Weight is a complicated issue that is not always so easy to just diet and exercise your way out of. Plus, you're both young and she's still under her parent's roof, so this further complicates things. Ideally, she needs to work on her issues with food, through a good nutritionist that works on health at every size, and a therapist. But this isn't on you, and this is something she'll have to decide on her own. The best thing you can do for her is listen when she needs to vent, be a shoulder to cry on, etc. And make sure she knows she has your unconditional love and support, no matter what size she is. I think, when it's time to talk, just tell her that you care about her, and you support whatever she wants to do. But say firmly you won't make her do anything, because that's controlling and not a way you want to treat her. But if she wants someone to go on walks with and someone to look at healthy meals with, you're happy to be a part of her journey.", "NTA\n\nYou can only do so much. Tough love is not a bad thing for her, although she is a stress eater so she probably ran off and indulged in food. It's going to be her own real motivation that has to take care of it.", "Justified AH. Sometimes you have to be brutal...this is her pattern, lament about the weight gain, then blame someone else so she can continue to stress eat, The only thing that could possibly help is therapy, but only if she wants to...you have to ask yourself the hard question...is this relationship worth it?  Its like having a spouse or family member who is a drug addict.....there is only so much you can do before you have to stop and tell that person they and only they can help themselves and you're out until they truly want help.", "YTA for yelling at her, but not for telling her that her weight gain is not your fault or your responsibility. Weight can be an incredibly sensitive subject, and I suspect she is trying to soothe herself by finding an alternative person to blame. FWIW, she isn't necessarily to blame, either. Weight gain at that level is a combination of genetics, brain chemistry, and mental wellbeing concerns, and she should seek out a treatment that takes both of those things into account (rather than treatment that suggests her will power is the problem).", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Surgery alone doesn\u2019t help if you don\u2019t also change your habits.", "Yes, totally, I don't think bariatric intervention in the form of pills and surgery is always necessary, but a bariatric doctor (not all of whom are bariatric surgeons) and a bariatric practice are better able to respond to the needs of a high weight individual (including referring her to a therapist who specifically specializes in weight issues) than a therapist. I was more frustrated by the response that a therapist (a mental health specialist) should be the go-to for a medical problem (obesity) than a medical doctor, because it seemed to me to be making weight gain a mental health issue (which is often not the case).", "I think he transiently feels bad for her because of the situation, not in general.", "Thank you I will look into these things! I appreciate the help, and thank you for wishing us both the best haha", "Must be American then lmao.", "Except it clearly is part of the picture here. She stress eats half a birthday cake, which could be a classified as a binge. This is a coping mechanism which won't disappear unless her mental health is addressed.", "As other replies mention, this seems like an instance where mental state and behavioral issues have a lot to do with her weight struggles. Any time stress eating and binge eating is a problem, a therapist is a really good idea. I have never been over weight or obese but I had an eating disorder for 6 years (anorexia and binge eating disorder) that I overcame through therapy, specifically cognitive behavioral therapy. It helped me stop binge/restricting and restructured by thoughts and emotions around food. It sounds like this intervention may be effective enough here", "I spent years in Alberta, no different.", "Yeah thats the most American province there is. But yeah Canadians are fat as fuck now too."]}
