We have a 2 year lease so I really want to fix this so we\u2019re not miserable for the next year and to start I need to see if I\u2019m in the wrong.\n\nLayla started dating Kyle about 6 months ago. Kyle has severe food allergies to shellfish, nuts and soy, as well as a lot of more mild/moderate allergies. \n\nI use nuts and soy *a lot* in my cooking and some occasional shrimp. At first, Layla would tell me that Kyle was coming over and I would just adjust whatever I was planning on making if it was something that would be aerosolized (mostly nuts) and this was fine. He\u2019s never had any reactions at our apartment from my food. \n\nBut it\u2019s slowly escalated and now they want me to not keep any ingredient in the apartment that could cause him anaphylaxis, even if I\u2019m not actively eating or cooking it while he\u2019s over.\n\nI\u2019ve refused and they\u2019ve both pushed back a lot on it and I snapped a little and told them I don\u2019t give a fuck about his allergies. I can accommodate him to an extent but I don\u2019t care if the contents of my cabinet make him uncomfortable. He doesn\u2019t need to be near my things at all. They\u2019re being very dramatic and insisting I\u2019m gonna \u201ckill him\u201d with my selfishness by having closed jars of nuts in the kitchen I pay to use. But I\u2019m not going to have my diet restricted by someone who doesn\u2019t even live here.\n\nLayla isn\u2019t speaking to me at all right now and I feel a little bad now because I do understand how serious allergies are but I also think they\u2019re overextending boundaries by telling me what I can or can\u2019t eat when he\u2019s not even here", "created_utc": 1680801147, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12dqx11/aita_for_telling_my_roommate_that_i_dont_give_a/", "score": 110, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Not a housemate whose needs MUST be accommodated", "NTA\n\nIf Kyle feels uncomfortable he can just leave.", "NTA it\u2019s Your home not his. He doesn\u2019t have to be there.\n\nThey can meet at his place or out in public.", "NTA. He does not pay rent, he does not live there. You do not need to make extreme accommodations for him. You already did enough to be nice, this is asking too much.", "I haven\u2019t looked at the comments so I may be off in thinking my opinion is unpopular but for me NTA. You pay half the rent for the apartment and are entitled to cook and eat what you want. You have already been accommodating by not cooking with allergens when he\u2019s coming over and not eating food with allergens around him. If Layla wants an allergen-free setting for her bf then she and him can find their own apartment. Your comments may have been a bit harsh but it seems like you\u2019ve been holding back for awhile and finally lost it.", "NTA. He does not live there nor does he pay rent. If your food makes him that uneasy, Layla can go to his place instead.", "INFO- how often does he come over?\nNTA though, a warning before he comes over is really all you need.", "NTA they should hang out at his nut-free house. This is your home that you pay for and if this wasn\u2019t agreed upon when you first moved in together, they are the ones who need to make other accommodations. You tried to be accommodating but now they are acting entitled. He\u2019s aware there are possible allergens there and it\u2019s up to him to be responsible for his own wellbeing.", "NTA\n\n> Layla would tell me that Kyle was coming over\n\nWell, easy solution: **he _shouldn't_**.\n\nYour environment is incompatible with his needs.\n\n> someone who **doesn\u2019t even live here**\n\nBeginning and end of this, as far as I'm concerned \\^\\^\\^", "NTA I know the intensity of allergies can vary but he should be able to deal with certain foods exiting in a place that he doesn't live. My roommates cook shellfish and I have a shellfish allergy and it is okay. They let me know when it's happening, wash the dishes and cookware immediately. They even let me know if they have recently microwaved or used the toaster oven. I'm not a doctor so maybe my opinion is ill informed but if you are keeping the food separate and all parties are being careful I think NTA.", "Sort of an asshole, but understandably so. \nExpecting you not to cook with what you like is unreasonable. Your reaction was rude. \n\nI\u2019d strictly only apologize for how you reacted to it but stand your ground on not removing the allergens. I have a tree nut allergy and have a pen. I expect my friends to not eat nuts and touch me, outside of that it\u2019s my responsibility.", "Nope, nope, nope, I'm anaphalactic to tree nuts and this is not how it works. I don't get to go over to a friend's house and demand they get rid of their Nutella. Don't cook with it when he's over, I think that's a fair/normal compromise, and make sure you wipe down the counters just to be safe, but anything beyond that isn't really a fair expectation.", "NTA maybe the way you expressed yourself was a little hard but my guess is they have been nagging you over and over. Kyle and your roommate can hangout in his free nut place \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA. You are reasonably accommodating. If they are concerned she can go to his place", "Overwhelmingly NTA of course, I just want to add that it\u2019s nice that you want to fix it with Laylah, so I just chime in with a suggestion, of just apologizing for the \u201cI don\u2019t give a crap\u201d thing, as you obviously do care, and have shown it by being forthcoming in changing your cooking plans for the times he\u2019s around.. But that\u2019s honestly as far as your care can go! Show Laylah that thread and that should set her right. Good luck", "NTA - you pay rent and he doesn\u2019t", "Do they think you\u2019ll kill him with your selfishness or shellfishness\ud83d\ude0f?\u2026.\nAlright I\u2019ll see myself to the door. Thank you\u2026", "NTA. Does Kyle not go grocery shopping?? What about fast food? Does he travel in a bubble in case he walks by someone eating a DQ Buster bar? If the allergies are bad to the extent that a girlfriends roommate can\u2019t even have these food items simply exist in their own home, it sounds like Kyle\u2019s allergies are probably really cutting into his quality of life.. and I\u2019d that\u2019s the case, what is in YOUR kitchen shouldn\u2019t be the priority.  Also, most of those foods are a great sources of protein, also\u2026 so are you just supposed to not get that?? \n\nEdit: rewording for clarity, my brain be a mess sometimes", "Is he on the lease and paying rent?  No?  Then NTA.  You are.  You live there.  You have a right to live there with your food and belongings.   I think it's great you're trying your best to be considerate of his allergies in your cooking  but that should be the limit.", "NTA. this is crazy, he doesn't even live there. if someone has a severe allergy, it is their responsibility to manage that, not yours. a grocery store won't hide all their peanuts when he walks in the door, i don't know why they think you should have to change anything. the fact that you would change your cooking is beyond nice, in my opinion. usually people with sensitivities bring their own food/containers/whatever they need to make it safe for them.", "NTA - like you said, he doesn't live there. He is not *entitled* to anything in *your* home unless you say so.", "NTA. Move out. Depending on where you live,  you can often break a lease without financial penalty if the landlord can rent the place out without undue hardship (eg. if it takes 6 months to find new renters.) In Vancouver, there is a rental crisis so there would be a lineup out the door of new renters,  for example.", "NTA - he doesn't live there. It might be time for Layla to move out and find somewhere that will accommodate.", "[deleted]", "NTA, you pay rent there and Kyle doesn't. You do you.", "NTA. You've accommodated enough especially when he doesn't live there and he's not your boyfriend.\n\n>if the contents of my cabinet make him uncomfortable. He doesn\u2019t need to be near my things at all.\n\nThis is exactly right, he shouldn't be rifling through your things", "NTA. Kyle doesn't live there. \n\nIf his allergies are so severe, he probably shouldn't be putting himself in harms way by coming to your apartment.", "NTA.  Your roommate should recognize that you shouldn't have to accommodate her boyfriend.  If she wants the house to be allergen free, she should at least prepare to make you an offer - like buying and preparing all your foods from now on.  Then at least you are compromising.", "NTA. He doesn't pay rent so why does he get a say? They could go hang out at his place or somewhere else", "He doesn't live there, he is not on the lease.  If he can't be in a space that has nuts then she needs to go to HIS place instead.  You have just as much right to eat, cook and live how you want.    NTA", "Nta \n\nI have a severe food allergy and I don't allow it in my house or let my husband eat it in case he forgets to brush his teeth then kisses me, has happened before. But I don't tell people not to have that food in their house. I warn people to not let it touch my stuff but they are welcome to have it since it's their food.", "NTA, they seem like they're really overreacting.", "NTA\n\nYou pay to live there and are on the lease and he is not. They can spend time at his place if they're that worried about the closed contents of your cupboard.", "You pay rent he doesn't. NTA. Though I expect you're going to need to find a new roommate or a place to live as this is not going to end unless they break up.", "NTA \n\nTechnically, but you really could kill him if his allergies are severe enough. If she is serious about this guy then they need to move out to their own allergy free place.", "So why can't she spend more time at his place??? \n\nYou pay half the rent, that entitles you to half the livable space", "NTA - its YOUR home too, you shouldn't have to adjust your living space for her boyfriend that DOES NOT LIVE THERE. allergies suck but again HE DOES NOT LIVE THERE you should be able to eat and cook however you like in your own home. she's the one being inconsiderate. if shes so mad about it she can pay the money to get outta the lease and go live with her boyfriend.  \n\n\nedit: also he could, ya know, NOT come over, like would it be THAT hard for them to go somewhere else?", "NTA, you live and pay to live here, he doesn't.", "NTA- you\u2019re the one paying rent not him. Layla could always go to Kyle\u2019s if they\u2019re so worried.", "NTA he doesn\u2019t live there so you don\u2019t have to be considerate of him. If she has an issue she can move in with him. \nLet your landlord know what\u2019s going on as well.", "NTA - Kyle doesn\u2019t even live there. If he feels endangered by the ingredients you keep in your cupboard then he shouldn\u2019t come over. You didn\u2019t sign a lease to live with Kyle. \n\nI think the fact that you were adjusting what you\u2019d cook when you knew he was coming over shows your willingness to compromise. Layla and Kyle are clearly not interested in a compromise, they only want things their way.", "NTA you\u2019ve already accommodated him to a reasonable extent and them expecting you to never have any of those items in the space YOU PAY TO LIVE IN is ridiculous, especially since he doesn\u2019t life there. If they\u2019re really that concerned, they can go spend time at his place.", "NTA.  Kyle doesn't pay rent, and can therefore pound sand.
