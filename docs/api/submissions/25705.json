That would make for a difficult relationship, even with nothing else to overcome.  An eleven year old, or a fifteen year old, has very little in common with a two year old.  And they were all either grown or nearly grown to adulthood by the time you were starting school.  \n\nPlus, they all lost their father.  No more than two years before your father came into their life.  That's an earth-shattering loss, and a titanic shift in their living situation, and there was no way that transition would be easy for them.  Even without adding a baby to the mix. \n\nAnd it sounds as if your mother shifted her attention from the life that was gone, with their father, to a future with your father and a new baby, before they were ready.  Your mother fell in love and got a new partner, they got a new housemate not of their choosing.  \n\nMeanwhile, you were just a baby, and had absolutely no way to understand the dynamic that was going on.  You just knew that you didn't fit in, and you wanted to. \n\nIt's easy to say your parents should have \"dealt with this\" long ago.  It's a lot harder to figure out how to deal with such a situation in a way that respects the emotions of both children who are mourning the loss of their father and a baby growing up in such a household.  \n\nYou (reasonably) feel put-upon when told you have no choice but to attend a wedding for one day.  They were told they needed to deal with their mother having a new partner, and a new baby, as a 24/7 change in their lives, with no choice in the matter. \n\nYour parents should have handled this better.  But I'm trying to imagine what a good way to handle this would have been, that respected everyone's feelings, but ensured appropriate behavior.  Especially because toddler-you would not understand \"polite but distant\" coming from your older half-siblings.  \n\nWhat do they wish? That their father never died.  That they grew up with their mother and father together.  And that's a circumstance where you would not have been born.  I don't know how to make that into something that's respectful of all of you.", "NTA - Sounds like this was a long time coming.  Perhaps family therapy would help?

Standing up for yourself and refusing to be a prop in your parents deluded idea of family is king behavior.

Your mother\u2019s kids have long made clear that you are not their sibling.  Your mother failed to integrate these two families.  She married relatively soon after their father died.  They probably perceive you as the reason in light of dating/pregnancy/birth/marriage sequence.  Not your fault.  This is all on mom.  Your desire not to be mistreated by her other kids is understandable.  Stick to your position.", "Ah man this makes me sad. NTA. If your sister truly cared how you feel she\u2019d call you and say how much she wants you there. It seems like your mums pleas fell on deaf ears and your sis doesn\u2019t care either way. I\u2019m sorry to say that! \n\nLosing a parent is can force siblings to bond somewhat unhealthily and it may be that they feel they\u2019re so tight because they grieved at a young age together. Most normal people would be horrified that their little brother felt so left out and excluded but despite being called out numerous times they refuse to change so it\u2019s kinda malicious at this stage.

I don't blame you for how you feel.  What does your dad say about this?  As things stand right now NTA.", "NTA\n\nI have something kind of similar with my own sisters. They were from the first marriages, while I'm from the second. There's also a 9 and 14 year age gap. Even though they're step sisters, they're close. Growing up, my second oldest sister was practically best friends with a cousin who's only a year older than me. Yet neither sister ever really wanted me. It sucks. It's awkward. It just leaves you feeling bad at times. \n\nI'm not saying you shouldn't go to the wedding. It probably won't ever change the relationship between you and the siblings if you do go. However, you're not the asshole of you refuse.", "NTA - yeah you could just suck it up and go since you are still a teenager. You don't always get a say in where you get to go.   \n\nBut at 16 - it is a great time to learn how to stand-up for yourself and your own well-being. (Not that you weren't already)  \n\nAnd this is honestly much more on your mom and dad than anyone else. A lot of times in blended families- blame gets pushed to the siblings. When they are probably reacting out of their own trauma essentially. Their dad died and mom remarried some dude and had a kid. That could have been VERY rough for them so they took it out on you. Or at least ignored you.  \n\nYour parents should have worked harder to integrate and create a better atmosphere for you growing up. They didn't - so this is on them. Not your half-sister (mostly).  \n\n16 years old is a good time to be like- hey parents, I am not okay with this so don't really want to partake in their celebrations. Or to pretend we are some close sibling group when we are not. They seem nice- but yeah, I will stay home.   \n\nHopefully your parents step up to the plate but it is very common for parents to double down and put the onus on you to make nice. So everyone pretends for a bit but resentment just grows.  \n\nIf I were in your shoes- I would reach out to your half-siblings - whichever one you feel closest to. And just let them know it has been rough for you as you felt like the left out family member. It's made you not really want to partake in family stuff as you don't feel like family to them.  \n\nNot to ask for an apology or for lip service for anything. Just to inform and let them know.   \n\nAgain- this is on your parents not the half-siblings. per se. They are just acting out of their weird upbringing. You just happen to get stuck in the middle.

I was unhappily going prior to that because I was like it's a few hours and just let it happen. But I guess I don't want an entire weekend where I feel like I'm on the outside.\n\nI do get that they were always going to be closer with each other most likely. We have a huge age gap and everything. I just wish they could have made the same effort they did with cousins of all different ages.

He feels like we should go even though they don't like either of us because we're still family at the end of it all.", "She realized and said she had talked to them and put them in therapy when they were younger.

But it doesn't change that we are family and should be there.", "All the conversations in the world won't change the past or the half siblings' feelings.

If they are still dismissive then, there is zero ground to build a normal relationship on. \n\nFor them, you not going to the wedding means you thereby shut the door for good. And maybe you are totally right to do this cause they simply suck. I can't judge that.

Timelines on grief are different. If they were still grieving their father and not ready for a replacement then your birth (whilst not fair and not your fault), was very poorly timed and just a kick in the teeth. Here you were, a beautiful example of how quickly your mother had moved on and forgotten their father. And then your mother remarried quickly after your birth, cementing that fact. Like I said, it\u2019s absolutely not your fault and you shouldn\u2019t suffer, but your mother should have been more careful with contraception and allowed her children to grieve their father and come round to the idea of their family changing before shoving it on them. They were 5, 7 and 8, undergoing complex emotions whilst their mother was busy putting her energy into dating and lining up her replacement. Unfortunately nothing will fix that. Your mother has failed you all. NTA.\n\n\nEdit after reading more of OP\u2019s comments: OP this isn\u2019t your fault and I\u2019m not blaming you, but I\u2019ll be devils advocate for a second here. You talk about how awful you felt realising you weren\u2019t wanted at 7 years old. Imagine having your father die, your mother quickly moving a random man in and then having a baby. You watch everyone coo over this baby. This baby gets a stable family, both parents, and all the support that comes with that, whilst you watch on with no father and a distracted mother. Everyone seems to have instantly forgotten your grief and needs. You turn to the only people who can relate and who treat you the same - your siblings. You become a little trio, huddling together against the world whilst your new \u2018family\u2019 have happy Father\u2019s Day celebrations and all those good things. By the time your mother bothers to realise that you\u2019re struggling it\u2019s too late. You\u2019ve hardened up and realised that you don\u2019t need them. You\u2019re not rude, you\u2019re socially polite, but you know your place and aren\u2019t willing to hurt yourself more by opening up. This *isn\u2019t* your siblings fault. Your relationship isn\u2019t there because of your mothers actions. She had the responsibility to meet their emotional needs and facilitate their healing and your bonding - she never bothered. Now your siblings are polite and distant and that\u2019s okay. They shouldn\u2019t disturb their own emotional well-being and dredge up bad memories to fake it with you. And your mother shouldn\u2019t be harassing your sister before her wedding (which will already be a sensitive thing because she\u2019ll grieve not being walked down the aisle by her father)  because she half-arsed parenting for the past 20 years.", "You could just go and ruin the entire wedding to prove a point \n\nBut that would make you a justified AH", "Great. So, she talked with you. And nothing changes per your desires for a relationship with these people. You should reiterate. Again, how is this different? \n\nThey get asked. You get punished?", "What about you, did she put you in therapy? I can't imagine growing up being ostracised like that all your life, it's unfair and your mother and father have both failed you as parents.\n\nIt was their job to make sure the older kids were raised and taught empathy, and to realise that it wasn't your fault their mum had moved on. They can't make them be friends with you, but they could call them out on the way they went about treating you.\n\nInstead it sounds like you got left to it.", "It didn't work, at all. So why is she punishing you, when she accepted their behavior whether she wanted to do it or not. She accepted them not bringing presents, them excluding you, and everyone knows it. \n\nIt seems she's more upset you're rocking the boat than anything. And I might be reaching here, but it feels the reason you're not grounded yet is because Mia's reaction wasn't sadness but more along the lines of \"Great!\".", "I think it\u2019s actually the opposite problem. Their mom raised them equally but things were unequal to start with. OP\u2019s half siblings were struggling with losing their dad at a young age and suddenly getting a new stepdad and baby brother within a year. They were raised to be kind, loving, and warm to their siblings and evidently they are. They just never saw OP as their sibling. That\u2019s still on her.", "You haven't been on here enough. People have asked if they were ah for doing this exact shit to a kid. People then told them they were right to as well.", "The reason is likely being yelled at for the last sixteen years to smile for the camera and make nice and act like she didn't replace their dad inside four years. The anger is misplaced, but OP is also the physical representation of their mom moving on from dad quickly and wanting them to be happy about it. He got two happy parents and a whole happy childhood. They got to watch that happen. In their own home. As they were told to play with the baby.\n\nThey're not warm, but they just ice him out. The three bonded over something traumatic and leaned into each other. Possibly because Mom was too busy with her new boyfriend and a baby?\n\nOP says they don't directly do anything to him. They just mostly act like he's not there and send a gift to be bare minimum polite.\n\nThinking mom may have dropped the ball on the grieving kids and blending of families and then tried to shoehorn OP in, leading to a lot of resentment.\n\nThey just don't want a relationship that's been forced on them for sixteen years. Not OP's fault.\n\nWe see the other side of this story way more often. \"My )mom/dad) (got divorced/remarried after death of other parent) and I don't like (stepdad/ stepmom) and they want me to play with (step/ half sibling) and I don't want anything to do with the kid. I tried to go do (thing for older kids) with my two siblings and instead, Mom said we had to do (small toddler friendly thing) and I told her I didn't want to because kid isn't my sibling.\"\n\nIt shows up once a week, here. We're seeing the other side. And look what happened when the parent continually said, 'you will love your new little brother.' They clearly resented it and pulled back.", "Yeah she and your other half siblings clearly resent the fact that your mum moved on after their dads death.", "On the off chance this is real, is your dad any more help than your mother? I\u2019d go to him since he doesn\u2019t have rose tinted glasses for your siblings, and might not care about appearances. \n\nDid your siblings even reach out to you about the wedding after you made it clear you didn\u2019t want to go?", "It's probably more complex than wishing you and your dad weren't there.\n\nShe's wishing her dad ***was*** there.\n\nAnd if her dad was there, that would, necessarily, mean you and your father wouldn't be in her life.\n\nAnd it is absolutely not wrong for someone who had a parent die wish that their parent was there.  If anything, it would be unnatural if they were delighted by the circumstances of losing their father.  \n\n\"Complicated\" and \"painful\" and \"awkward\" and \"hard for a child to process\" all come to mind as appropriate descriptions of how they probably have felt since their father died, and your mother met your father. \n\nEven if they had fully processed and come to grips with the loss of their father, they'd still miss him.  They'd still wish they hadn't lost him.  They still wouldn't think that him dying was a good thing, no matter how it worked out in the long run. \n\nEven if they'd fully processed the situation, there would still be nostalgia.  There would still be \"what ifs.\" There would still be, at milestone events such as a wedding, a sadness that their family was incomplete, that their father wasn't there.  \n\nAnd probably no one was willing to hear them say \"I don't care about New Dad.  I don't care that we got Little Brother. I want MY DAD back.\"  Their emotions would have been criticized as cruel to you (which they were) even though they were 100% natural and understandable, as well.", "I think you are correct. You mom just cares about appearances. Stand your ground and don't go.", "Listen, don\u2019t worry about going to a wedding. This will all be history in a few short years.

Her telling them to be nicer to him and take your little brother, too, probably made it worse. They were twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fiffteen. They probably weren't thrilled with stepdad anyways. Now they're told, 'oh, and make nice with a toddler, too.'\n\nThey never wanted any of that. Sounds like Mom screwed the blending of families and the kids got resentful and instead of as much separation as they could and giving them time... she constantly tried to force it and probably drove the older ones further away.\n\nOP actually telling Mom no and taking a step back now will probably make OP feel better and might actually be helpful in possibly finding a relationship with them when he's older. Or they all go low contact with mom.\n\nThose kids were young when dad died and probably weren't ready. Something like that really sets kids' emotional development back. Mom probably messed a lot of steps up and they just weren't ready.\n\nWe see a lot of teenagers and early 20s on here saying they don't want their step/ half sibling because of issues with parent/ step parent. They aren't the AH, unless they are being directly cruel to the child. Polite and absent is probably the fault of the adults screwing things up a decade and a half ago.\n\nNot OP's fault. Not immediately blaming the older kids, either.", "Which is nothing the new sibling had any control over... Be mad at the parents if you want to be mad... But not the child. It's it even remotely related to their father being gone. I mean, I can understand this kind of thing when they were young... But they are grown-ups now.  \nThe worst of all is that they eventually were mad at mom, but it was just easier to take it out on OP.  \nSure you can't force love, but it seems they weren't even decent towards him.  \nSure he could have been step-daddy's little darling and got preferential treatment by him... But even that wouldn't be his fault but step-dad's."]}
