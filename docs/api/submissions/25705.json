Their dad died 20 years ago and my mom met my dad 17 years and had me (16m) pretty soon after.

I also don't feel like they love me or see me as their brother. But I'll get to the point. They are civil with me but I always feel very left out around them. Christmas where everyone gets together sucks because it becomes so clear how much they resent/dislike/are indifferent to me. They'll talk with cousins about everything and they laugh and joke and bring them gifts. And not just cousins their age but cousins my age and younger than me too. But they never talk to me like that. If I try it's strained and they look to change the subject.\n\nMom had to ask a few years if they brought anything for me because they handed out gifts to everyone except for me and then they'd be like oh yeah and there was no interest in watching me open a gift but the interest was there for others. One time I remember we were asked to all pose for a grandkid photo and Ava, Ben and Mia had their arms around each other and they were leaning close to the cousins closest and I was sort of on my own until some of my cousins told me to step closer to them. It was allowed but I know afterward my grandma told my half siblings they should have been warmer to me. I was 7 or 8 at the time.\n\nI know Ava and Mia say they only have one brother. I think Ben says he has none but I never heard him say it either but I have heard the girls say it.\n\nWhen Mia got engaged it was really awkward with some of her fianc\u00e9's family not knowing who the hell I was at the engagement party. The three of them have always been SO close. Even in the photos taken I felt like I was added for some unknown reason and wasn't really a sibling.\n\nThe wedding is coming up soon and my parents were talking about it. They said we'd be staying for the weekend because the venue is a little too far to go for just the day. At that point I decided that I wouldn't go so I told my parents to leave me at home when they go to the wedding. It became a big thing and they said I had to attend my sister's wedding. I told them how I feel and mom said we're still a family and she'd talk to them all but Mia especially. But I am going to the wedding. I said I refuse. They were like you'd be grounded for a long time if you refuse to come. I told them to ground me for a year because I'm not going.\n\nI heard mom talk to her kids on the phone and she was saying how they should make an effort to let me know I am wanted there. My parents asked if I stood by what I said and I said yes.

That would make for a difficult relationship, even with nothing else to overcome.  An eleven year old, or a fifteen year old, has very little in common with a two year old.  And they were all either grown or nearly grown to adulthood by the time you were starting school.  \n\nPlus, they all lost their father.  No more than two years before your father came into their life.  That's an earth-shattering loss, and a titanic shift in their living situation, and there was no way that transition would be easy for them.  Even without adding a baby to the mix. \n\nAnd it sounds as if your mother shifted her attention from the life that was gone, with their father, to a future with your father and a new baby, before they were ready.  Your mother fell in love and got a new partner, they got a new housemate not of their choosing.  \n\nMeanwhile, you were just a baby, and had absolutely no way to understand the dynamic that was going on.  You just knew that you didn't fit in, and you wanted to. \n\nIt's easy to say your parents should have \"dealt with this\" long ago.  It's a lot harder to figure out how to deal with such a situation in a way that respects the emotions of both children who are mourning the loss of their father and a baby growing up in such a household.  \n\nYou (reasonably) feel put-upon when told you have no choice but to attend a wedding for one day.  They were told they needed to deal with their mother having a new partner, and a new baby, as a 24/7 change in their lives, with no choice in the matter. \n\nYour parents should have handled this better.  But I'm trying to imagine what a good way to handle this would have been, that respected everyone's feelings, but ensured appropriate behavior.  Especially because toddler-you would not understand \"polite but distant\" coming from your older half-siblings.  \n\nWhat do they wish? That their father never died.  That they grew up with their mother and father together.  And that's a circumstance where you would not have been born.  I don't know how to make that into something that's respectful of all of you.", "NTA - Sounds like this was a long time coming.  Perhaps family therapy would help?  Good luck!", "NTA\n\n\"If you punish me for this, you'll be punishing me for doing something once that they have all been doing to me, repeatedly, for my whole life.\"", "You are old enough to stand you ground here IF you are sure this is the hill to die on.  I don't know many teens that like weddings.  Pro tip:  I used to be pastor, and most pastors HATE weddings.  Don't feel bad about not going.", "You're older siblings have treated you poorly for years.  And your mom and dad have allowed this to happen.

She barely even acknowledges you.", "NTA, but do accept this\n\nA: looks bad for your parents\n\nB: the relationship with the half sister is done now. There isn't a coming back from this\n\n\nAlso, your seem to expect a lot from your half sister, but I don't see you putting in much of an effort yourself. You feel excluded, but don't try to be included.", "NTA and what I don't understand is why are they angry? It's not like this came as a surprise for them...they witnessed for years how you were treated but they expect you to be your siblings doormat forever? Your parents are trying to force a relationship and the argument \"we are family\" is not good enough. You don't need to put up with their behavior anymore, you are old enough to start choosing the people you want in your life and you should choose those who really love you, value your presence and support you.", "nta ask your mom why she allowed her kids to treat you that way yet you're being punished for doing the same thing", "NTA. Your half-siblings don't deserve the pleasure of your presence.", "NTA\n\nStick to your guns.\n\nWhy should you have to go to a function for someone who does not like you\n\nTake the grounding, I doubt they will enforce it for long.", "the only AH are your parents for not noticing this and deal with it at the right time ......", "NTA at all.

Your mom is being really unfair to you because she wants to preserve her ideal of one big happy family in spite of all evidence to the contrary. Can your dad intervene on your behalf?", "I mean, if everyone in the extended family noticed their behaviour towards you, your mom had to saw it too! And this means she choose not to do anything about it, allowing this abuse. \nI get she wants you there but you have every reason not to go. And honestly, your sister will thank you for it. \nI'm sorry you had to live like this. I hope you and your parents can work this out and reach an agreement.\n\nNTA", "NTA  You are 16 and you are already on your way to being a king.  Standing up for yourself and refusing to be a prop in your parents deluded idea of family is king behavior.  Your parents could not possibly have not noticed the way you have been treated and it sounds like they have allowed it to happen.  On the day of the wedding, invite a couple of your friends over and eat pizza and play video games.  It will be more fun than any wedding.", "NTA...You're old enough to decide whether you wish to attend events or not.  Your mother has allowed you to be sidelined by your half-siblings, so she shouldn't be surprised at your reaction.", "NTA.  You are old enough to decide whether to go to a wedding.  Your mother\u2019s kids have long made clear that you are not their sibling.  Your mother failed to integrate these two families.  She married relatively soon after their father died.  They probably perceive you as the reason in light of dating/pregnancy/birth/marriage sequence.  Not your fault.  This is all on mom.  Your desire not to be mistreated by her other kids is understandable.  Stick to your position.", "Ah man this makes me sad. NTA. If your sister truly cared how you feel she\u2019d call you and say how much she wants you there. It seems like your mums pleas fell on deaf ears and your sis doesn\u2019t care either way. I\u2019m sorry to say that! \n\nLosing a parent is can force siblings to bond somewhat unhealthily and it may be that they feel they\u2019re so tight because they grieved at a young age together. Most normal people would be horrified that their little brother felt so left out and excluded but despite being called out numerous times they refuse to change so it\u2019s kinda malicious at this stage. Whether they like it or not you\u2019re their brother whether it\u2019s full or half! You share a mother and they need a reality check.", "Nta", "Your parents should be angry ... at themselves.\nThey've let this continue for your whole life. \n\nNTA.", "Your mom needs to have that conversation NOW, before you decide not to go.  A lot of this is on her for allowing your siblings to carry on treating you like this.  It's absolutely mind-blowing and I hope she doesn't say she didn't realize it.  I don't blame you for how you feel.  What does your dad say about this?  As things stand right now NTA.", "NTA\n\nI have something kind of similar with my own sisters. They were from the first marriages, while I'm from the second. There's also a 9 and 14 year age gap. Even though they're step sisters, they're close. Growing up, my second oldest sister was practically best friends with a cousin who's only a year older than me. Yet neither sister ever really wanted me. It sucks. It's awkward. It just leaves you feeling bad at times. \n\nI'm not saying you shouldn't go to the wedding. It probably won't ever change the relationship between you and the siblings if you do go. However, you're not the asshole of you refuse.", "NTA - yeah you could just suck it up and go since you are still a teenager. You don't always get a say in where you get to go.   \n\nBut at 16 - it is a great time to learn how to stand-up for yourself and your own well-being. (Not that you weren't already)  \n\nAnd this is honestly much more on your mom and dad than anyone else. A lot of times in blended families- blame gets pushed to the siblings. When they are probably reacting out of their own trauma essentially. Their dad died and mom remarried some dude and had a kid. That could have been VERY rough for them so they took it out on you. Or at least ignored you.  \n\nYour parents should have worked harder to integrate and create a better atmosphere for you growing up. They didn't - so this is on them. Not your half-sister (mostly).  \n\n16 years old is a good time to be like- hey parents, I am not okay with this so don't really want to partake in their celebrations. Or to pretend we are some close sibling group when we are not. They seem nice- but yeah, I will stay home.   \n\nHopefully your parents step up to the plate but it is very common for parents to double down and put the onus on you to make nice. So everyone pretends for a bit but resentment just grows.  \n\nIf I were in your shoes- I would reach out to your half-siblings - whichever one you feel closest to. And just let them know it has been rough for you as you felt like the left out family member. It's made you not really want to partake in family stuff as you don't feel like family to them.  \n\nNot to ask for an apology or for lip service for anything. Just to inform and let them know.   \n\nAgain- this is on your parents not the half-siblings. per se. They are just acting out of their weird upbringing. You just happen to get stuck in the middle. Hope this works out wel for you... if not... try to let the anger and fighting ride as it might not be worth it until you are out of the house.", "NTA - I\u2019m so so sorry that this was your experience in your family. My heart breaks for you.", "It's not even one day. One day I was more okay with. It's the whole weekend and give everything, that pushed me over the edge to saying no. I was unhappily going prior to that because I was like it's a few hours and just let it happen. But I guess I don't want an entire weekend where I feel like I'm on the outside.\n\nI do get that they were always going to be closer with each other most likely. We have a huge age gap and everything. I just wish they could have made the same effort they did with cousins of all different ages. It would have hurt less to not feel so totally different from the whole family where they were concerned.", "I don't think my half siblings would ever agree to that. Not sure if it would help with my parents either but I might suggest it.", "I think she'd probably prefer it if both dad and I weren't there. But she invited us because she tolerates our existence for mom. That's about all I think I will ever get.", "I have tried to be included. I have tried to join in and talk to them but they can't be clearer that they don't want to try as well. What else am I meant to do? It's not just my half sister. I feel like none of them really want me around and none of them try with me.", "She told me she had talked to them a lot over the years about treating me more warmly and kindly than they did and that she had them in therapy when they were younger.", "100% this is all on the parents", "My dad is on my mom's side with this. He feels like we should go even though they don't like either of us because we're still family at the end of it all.", "She realized and said she had talked to them and put them in therapy when they were younger. My dad told me sometimes we do things for family that we don't want to do. He also acknowledged that they only tolerate him for mom too. But it doesn't change that we are family and should be there.", "All the conversations in the world won't change the past or the half siblings' feelings. Sure, they might grudgingly include him more if mom pushes it but it's not going to change anything and forcing him to be part of this charade is just cruel and short sighted.", "I don't feel close to any of my half siblings. Never have. I'm not in any kind of one on one contact with any of them. Not sure which of them I would ask.", "Just and only out of curiosity\n\nWould you like to have a normal relation with them?\n\nIf you do, I wonder if you ever went over to just talk, and explained how you felt? If they are still dismissive then, there is zero ground to build a normal relationship on. \n\nFor them, you not going to the wedding means you thereby shut the door for good. And maybe you are totally right to do this cause they simply suck. I can't judge that. I'm just saying that (if you want to have a normal relationship), you should talk to learn why they treat you like this. If you don't, that's on you (since you are the one who choose to close the door)", "which did nothing.", "I'm so sorry. Family is who you make them to be and it's clear that they don't see you that way. Your dad should be defending you. I'm disappointed that he is so concerned about keeping your mom's illusion that he's willing to overlook your very valid feelings.", "It's on him to do the things for family he doesn't want to do. You've spent your entire life being ignored - which means you grew up with this feeling.  My heart breaks imagining you at 3 or 4 or 5- with them.  They aren't family. They made that choice and if you decide to go and try to build bridges if they genuinely offer - then that's on you, it's your choice. Nobody has the right tot force someone else to accept these transgressions", "At one point I would have but I kind of gave up?\n\nI did ask them once why they disliked me or why they weren't talking to me like with everyone else. They ignored me when I asked."]}
