You told her no. End of discussion. I get she was trying to be helpful or whatever but as soon as you told her no that was the end of it and she shouldn't have kept pressing.", "NAH. Since you said they were great when you had troubles with breastfeeding, I am assuming there is not a history of overreaching or JUSTNO behavior. It\u2019s pretty common for other people to feed babies, it\u2019s also common for mom\u2019s to feel protective of that bond. At its base, the request isn\u2019t unreasonable. And you saying no isn\u2019t unreasonable. \n\nIf she keeps bugging you at other times, she becomes the asshole. If she starts a whole family feud because of this, she\u2019s the asshole.

If she\u2019s supportive, she should be able to work on the situation/ apologize.", "NAH, but you should probably talk to your doctor about PPD/A, because it's not going to confuse your child who is feeding them or cause them to bond less with you? It is very normal for other people to want to help, and feeding the baby is one of those things.", "NAH I would explain your feelings of inadequacy and she\u2019ll probably understand (since you said she\u2019s been supportive otherwise. \n\nIf she\u2019s generally been a good MIL, I would consider gifting her a few turns at feeding the baby. It sounds like it would really mean a lot to her. I say this as someone whose youngest kid is 16. I was super protective of all the special moments with my babies and now that I have the benefit of hindsight I do have some regrets about not sharing a little more. My MIL has been pretty amazing and did deserve more grace from me. \n\nI also want to remind you that what you are doing for your baby is amazing. My SIL pumped exclusively for an entire year. It\u2019s a lot of work and however long you do it is a gift to your baby. You have a lot of years and a lot of parenting ahead of you. There is no one thing that makes you a parent. You are not inadequate. You love your baby and you\u2019re doing everything you can to take care of them. That\u2019s the most important part.", "Info: if she\u2019s supportive why do have a problem with her feeding the baby and bonding with her Grandchild.

One feeding one day out of how many isn't going to break, negate, or in any way affect the bond you have with your baby. Calm down, momma. You don't have to do everything to be everything to baby. You already are. It sounded like your mil was trying to give you a break and let you enjoy a meal - something new moms don't get to do.", "You need therapy. Your insecurities are effecting your child. Your bond with your child will not be damaged in any way if someone else feeds your baby occasionally.", "Eh. I think you should talk to your doctor. I could not breast feed or pump. I absolutely loved seeing relatives feeding our daughter. It in no way impedes our ability to bond. I certainly you\u2019re allowing your husband to feed the baby?", "YTA and I\u2019ve never heard such utter nonsense in all my life", "NTA, however I don't know how this bonding works. However, is one feeding going to destroy and make Grammy the one your child has the strongest bond with?\n\nYou are the Mom, you will be number 1. Grandma just wanted to help and bond too. However you did say no, and she should have listened.", "NAH\n\nNot being able to breastfeed isn\u2019t a big deal to the baby as long as they get fed they don\u2019t care how or by who but it clearly is to you ( I\u2019m not trying to be dismissive, I have 2 kids and couldn\u2019t breastfeed not even pump because of medication), at the same time your mil is having a very normal reaction for a loving grandparent of wanting to help you and bond with the baby. Maybe you can compromise, you feed the baby and she gets cuddles after.", "NTA", "You\u2019re the mother, and as long as you\u2019re the primary caregiver, your child will always bond with you. I exclusively pumped with mine (somehow they just refused to latch) and I\u2019m still the kid\u2019s favourite person \ud83e\udd23 my mum and MIL have bottle fed them both formula and BM to allow me to rest/eat/do other stuff. \n\nIt\u2019s all right to delegate. Baby will be fine. That said, I know how pushy MILs can be, and No should be a complete sentence.", "NAH she asked, you said no. \n\nBut I can assure you, the bond your talking about will not go away, break or anything else if others feed your child. If anything it will help you to be able to focus a couple of minutes on yourself. You deserve that! But if you're not ready, you're not ready. You decide. \n\nOh, and pumping is NOTHING to feel bad about. You are just as much a good and loving mom no matter how you feed your child. I've been there, you feel like a failure, but you're not. Your child needs you just as much! And you're doing GREAT, you're a good mom! Believe that! \n\nGood luck!", "NTA\n\nThey should respect the mother's wish and only hold or feed the baby when you are happy with it. Period.", "NAH\n\nYour MIL went about it the wrong way. She should have respected that fact that you wanted to feed your baby. However, I wouldn\u2019t say she was the asshole because she did eventually relent and not escalate the situation further and she did have good intentions.\n\nBut you\u2019re certainly not the asshole for wanting to feed your own baby and spend that time bonding. You\u2019re the mother and you 100% get that say at all times. You should have had to argue with her about it. After you specified that you wanted to do it and didn\u2019t care about the food she should have backed off.\n\nYou did everything right. You\u2019re definitely not the asshole, just a good mom.", "NTA but I promise you that letting your inlaws handle the occasional feeding will not jeopardize the baby\u2019s bond with you. Exclusive pumping is an extraordinary amount of work; pumping then feeding the baby is the equivalent of feeding twins. For your own sake, please try to get comfortable with others feeding your baby.", "NTA.  It takes a while for everyone to figure out how their role is going to work with the first baby/grandbaby.  Clear boundaries are really important.  \n\nMy firsts (twins) didn't latch but I was so tired I didn't care who fed them because I spent a great deal of time pumping.  I didn't really bond with them until I stopped devoting myself to pumping and started taking better care of myself.  When my second/third came, she exclusively wanted the nipple and we were attached at the hip for 15 months until I booted her off - which is the most emotionally torturing thing I've experienced next to watching my youngest happily go to her first day of preschool (after being promised second breakfast) without looking back once.  (I deduced she may be a hobbit.)\n\nThere is no right experience, every kid is different.  If being the one to feed him is how you bond and you want that to be just you or you and you partner, draw that line.", "Nta no means no its your baby.", "NTA. You're the mom and what you say goes. She has to learn what \"NO\" means. You should never have to say it twice.", "NTA you want to bond with your baby during feeding time. You could explain your feelings to you MIL, she will probably understand if you communicate why you want to feed the baby.", "That old saying it takes a village to raise a child is true.  Until recently here in the US relatives often lived together so aunts, uncles, grandparents helped raise the child. Unless she is doing something wrong I think your baby is lucky to have her.\n\nI don\u2019t think either of you are the A******.  You need to relax and enjoy the baby", "NTA", "NTA. You are trying to substitute latching with bottle-feeding as best as you can. Your MIL is taking advantage of that it seems. Her intentions are good but it\u2019s slightly hypocritical as if you could feed directly from your breast she probably would not be willing to do the same. You\u2019re the mother and should be allowed to feed your baby.", "NTA It's so obnoxious when you have to repeat the same answer over and over. You said no and she kept pushing. If you want to be the one feeding your own baby, the least she can do is respect that.", "NTA. I understand that it's a bonding experience for her, but you had told her 'no' multiple times and she refused to listen. As someone who can sometimes be a bit pushy with certain things, i understand the MIL's want to bottle feed your baby to perhaps give you a break and also so she can bond with her grandchild. But what's not cool is that you had to tell her 'no' multiple times for her to actually listen to you. This decision to let anyone else feed your child is up to you as the mother, and only for you to let anyone feed or hold your child when you feel comfortable with it", "NTA", "NTA. You said no and that should be the end of the discussion. MIL absolutely was TA for pushing.", "Nope,  nta. When I had my son, I noticed it took me a long time to give up \"control\" (lack of a better word) on certain things. We have it in our post partum heads that we need to do all the things all the time for our babies. And that's fine! You're not ready to let someone else feed your baby.\n\n  I exclusively breastfeed from the tap, so no one ever had the option to help me feed him.  But once he started solids, my mil would offer to feed him.  I was sooooo uncomfortable in the beginning because i felt like it was something I was supposed to be doing.  It took me a while to let someone else other than my husband, change his diaper, change his clothes, give him a bath,  put him down to bed,  put him in the car seat,  etc. I eventually got comfortable letting others help,  but I had to take it one thing at a time.  Feeding is one of the most special things you can do with your baby.  There are many other ways for her to bond with your baby that doesn't push your boundary. \n\nA mom should never be pushed to do something she not comfortable with when it comes to her baby. Even she's allowed it before or if others think \"it's not a big deal\". Mom says no... that's it! You're doing a great job,  and you're a great mom!", "NTA. I was super disappointed my child couldn't nurse. So while they were newborn we were the primary ones to feed them grandparents didn't until later on. Your kid your call.", "NAH - Convey your words to MIL which you stated in the comments because 'No' does not fully inform her. Infact it may be hurtful. Explain why the feed bonding time is critically important to you and you'd love them to bond with the baby through play.  \n\nNAH - MILs not for asking given how you thrived due to her help in the past and NAH - You want the bottle bonding time for several reasons.", "Nah", "NTA.

Babies still bond with adoptive parents and their non-birthing parent. It's not just about who gives a baby the food. There is so much more in bonding with an infant.

I got mad on your behalf when I read those because they probably don't know what its like to have a new baby.  Some moms are okay feeding formula or pumping so they can pass that off to someone else so they can get some sleep or shower or eat.  I was not one of those people.  I was the type of mom that asked for my baby back after someone was holding him for 5 min because I just wanted my baby back.  And that's normal.
