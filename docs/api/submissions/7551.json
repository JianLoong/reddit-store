This past Friday, she asked me to let her son spend the night so she could throw a surprise party for another friend. I agreed on one condition: she must pickup her son at 7:30 am. The reason being I had to leave the house at 8 to exchange my son with his dad, and then be at work by 10 am. She agreed.\nShe actually called me before the party and I reminded her to get him at 7:30. \nThe next day, at 7:25, I call her and her phone is off. I drive to her house, and her car isn\u2019t there. At this point, I\u2019ve sent several text messages going off on her for being so inconsiderate. I also demanded a $75 cash apology. \nA mutual friend ended up agreeing to watch her kid while I went to work. I didn\u2019t hear from his mom until 10 am. She apologized and said her \u201cfriend\u201d left her downtown without her keys and wallet. I told her I didn\u2019t care about her apology and she was a sorry ass friend. \nTonight, she got mad because I posted on my story asking my followers if they wanted a story time about how my \u201cfriend\u201d abandoned her child with me for 2.5 hours when I had to work. She proceeded to tell me again, about how her friend left her downtown and she felt really badly and she didn\u2019t know what I expected her to do. I told her I expected a $75 apology, and I\u2019d split the money with the friend who watched her kid that morning. She said it was \u201cgross\u201d of me to ask for money because she is a struggling single mom. AITA for asking for a cash apology? Should I be more understanding to what happened to her that caused this situation in the first place?\n\nIt should be noted that this isn\u2019t the first time she\u2019s done something like this: she did the same thing to our mutual friend who watched her son that morning.", "created_utc": 1673925822, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10e1g2z/aita_for_demanding_a_cash_apology_from_a_friend/", "score": 256, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Asking for compensation is one thing, but for you to feel so entitled to a cash payout that you \"demanded a $75 cash apology\" is childish at best.\n\nFurther, the fact that you announced your business to your \"followers\", basically putting your friend on blast, also makes you the asshole here.

But its not - this is a friend with a habit of irresponsibly dumping her child on others longer than agreed.\n\nActions have consequences, and financial consequences are often the most effective deterrents (see parking/speeding tickets).\n\nOp has two options - never agree to watch her kid's best friend again (awkward for several reasons), or make sure her friend (the mom) understands that there are consequences for flaking.  I think op should have warned of the consequence up front, but otherwise I'm fine with this.\n\nEspecially since she had to scramble to find care for someone else's kid with impossibly short notice and the carer likely wants to be paid.  The other option would have been calling the police for abandonment, which would have been way worse.", "She would have been within her rights to call the police and CPS. The child was abandoned.", "You don't actually buy the \"abandoned downtown story?\" First off, if she knows she needs to collect her child at 730, shouldn't have gotten so inebriated as to \"get abandoned\" downtown.  Poor planning on her part and its irresponsible.  More likely scenario is she overslept because she got wasted and was up all night. Or that she never had any intention of honoring the original pickup time in the first place.", "I'm confused why you think this is extortion", "How is it extortion? Very confused where people are getting that idea from", "Do you not know what extortion is?", "major city in my country!

I don't blame OP for being pissed and I probably wouldn't agree to watch her kid again.  But she wants a $75 cash apology?  I wouldn't give her a penny and go nc with her.  This is an over the top request that I would ignore.\n\nUnfortunately, the biggest losers here will be the 2 kids that are best friends.", "ESH.  She obviously was in the wrong initially, but demanding a \u201ccash apology\u201d and posting a story on social media is petty.  If anything - you could have suggested that she pay the mutual friend that helped watch her child that morning (as this was unplanned).  \n\nYour reaction has likely ruined your child\u2019s friendship - it can only be awkward between the parents go forward.  I feel bad for both children in this scenario.", "Esh. \nShe shouldn\u2019t have left her son passed 7:30; you shouldn\u2019t have gone online to share and shame.", "NTA.

Just drop her as a friend and move on", "NTA, but time to say goodbye to this 'friend.'  Being a single parent is not an excuse to be careless and thoughtless about her child.  Drop the monetary demand and just say 'No' to any future requests.", "ESH. I was totally understanding your frustrations about this flaky woman, but when you said that you went on social media to tell \u201call of your followers\u201d about it, you lost all compassion from me.

But no phone?   No friend to let her borrow a phone?   \n No establishment that would let her use their phone?   BULLSHIT.   She was having a great time and didn't want to be worried with her kid.   \n\n\nThe \"cash apology\" is tacky.   You may as well write that off, since it's never gonna happen anyway.   But do let her know that you won't be babysitting for her ***ever*** again, and mean it.", "ESH.
