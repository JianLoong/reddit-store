Well, it\u2019s obvious from the incident at the party that N is definitely not over you.

While it was not the best way to end things with your long time friend you also made the reasonable decision.  I would say while it is understandable that N was jealous it was inexcusable the way she tried to get your attention.  Don't be so quick to end the friendship though as we shouldn't be judged by our most idiotic non violent/illegal decisions.  But let her know that you will not be around her with your GF and if there's any conflict you will default to your GF's side.  I hate friendships ending, maybe its me being sentimental.", "NTA if she\u2019s behaving like that and you don\u2019t put up your boundaries she will continue to behave like that towards any girl you bring into your life. It\u2019s obviously going to be tricky cutting out someone you\u2019ve known for so long but definitely the right move. And you shouldn\u2019t feel bad about defending someone who she decided to verbally berate, even if she has been a long time friend.", "You did right your ex friend was rude & mean towards your girlfriend! I\u2019m pretty sure she is jealous of her so it\u2019s best you take your distance!!", "Ah, the rare lady incel. Yeah, she's probably convinced the only reason you're friends in the first place is because you are attracted to her, and that's why you stayed friends despite rejecting her- \"You'll come around\" or \"You're just lying to yourself\". \n\nNTA, cutting her out is the only way.", "Uh, don't push people", "This was like a little K-drama lol!

The poor girl was so anxious she dropped another water\u2026 anxiety is no joke, it\u2019s physical and mental and it\u2019s sad someone saw that and used it against them.", "Sadly I'm unable to not meet her at all since we all in the same school (N is year above us) and even if I do make her leave the friend group she is still going to meet me a lot bc of our friends, I'll try to keep distance from her tho", "Wdym shoved her?", "We know that, since the beginning she told me that her anxiety is pretty bad but I don't really care, she's really cute and nice, she's also trying to get a therapist right now for her anxiety and trying to get better (if her mom actually will try to search for one because alone she's unable to get a therapist) \nWe are trying to get better together and I hope we could stay together and get things more serious (:", "Oh don't worry, ending relationships aren't easy for me too, we are probably still going to meet and talk but just not as close as we were before lol", "She sounds like a keeper.", "That\u2019s more than enough, OP. You don\u2019t have to tell your friend group to cut N out of their lives, but make it clear to N that you and her are simply \u201cfriends of a friend\u201d.
