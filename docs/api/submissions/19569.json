Just tell them that your family must have forgotten AGAIN that you have other obligations. You are in no way responsible for the agreements they make! \n\nRemember, on a plain, they always ask you to put on your own mask first before helping other, you need to do this in your everyday life as well. \n\nHope it gets better. \ud83d\ude4f", "NTA.

It makes your life more stressful and makes it more stressful for these ladies who think they have something sorted when really they dont.\n\nUltimately you need to sit down with mum, dad and sister and say 'I respect your time, personal life and responsibilities and I dont understand why it is you seem to have no respect for me or these things in my life. I need you to stop volunteering me for things and stop hounding me about doing things I never agreed to. If I did that to you, you wouldnt bre happy' perhaps end with, if you're unable to respect me and my time, maybe we need to go low contact for a time until you can.", "NTA, your mom and sister are the angels of the neighborhood. Send them your rate.", "Let them both know, and your father too for that matter that you will no longer be doing projects for people.  If they need things done they can call and schedule it with you, and you charge $20 an hour. Make sure you send this through text so there is a paper trail and then just stop doing the things they say you'll do.  Will it make you look bad to the people they volunteer to help?  Maybe, but who cares. And if they keep doing it, go low or no contact.", "No is a complete sentence. \nRinse and repeat to they get it", "NTA. Do not fold. They can yell, and publically humiliate you all they want but do not back down. My mom is pretty similar in that respect and i had to set clear boundaries with her in order for her to stop and listen to me. Its fucking ridiculous that your mom and sister are volunteering you for stuff. You are not the whole neighborhoods door mat. If they are so concerned with the well ebung of their neighbors they can do that shit on their own.", "NTA. I really don\u2019t know how else you could have handled it. You weren\u2019t rude, and your repeated \u201cno\u201d means nothing to them. What else could you do?? \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af\n\nIs there a reason your mom or sister can't help clean out a garage or shovel manure? Neither are specialized jobs, no skillset required. And if you work slow, no major fitness (beyond being upright and able) required either. Why aren't your mom or sister doing these things? At 29, your mom is my mom's age or younger. My mom changed the timing belt on her tractor a few weeks ago. Today she was using the chain saw to clean up downed trees.", "NTA. OP\u2019s sister and mom want the \u201chero\u201d praise heaped upon them for helping out these people without actually doing any of the work.", "NTA and I don\u2019t think you were too harsh. Just remember that \u201cNo.\u201d is a complete sentence and leave it at that. Don\u2019t let them guilt you.", "NTA\n\nThey get the thanks for helping people without ever having to actually help them. They\u2019re basically pimping you out and getting paid in gratitude while you do the messy  work. They\u2019re extreme AHs.", "Nta don't go. The next time anyone tells you anything just tell that you never ok it with any of them. That if they needed anything done that they can either do it themselves or stop volunteering to do it.", "Sorry, no one can take advantage of you without your cooperation.\nSend them a very clear text that explains you will not show up for anything that they volunteer you for and then follow through.", "Your mother and sister are being double sexist. Secuat towards themselves by thinking they can't possibly help with such manual labor and sexist toward you for obviously thinking that YOU have to because you are the young male of the family. \n\nThey want to look good to everyone but don't want to do any of the work that would require. \n\n NTA", "NTA. I agree with other posters that you likely need to go minimal contact with your mom/sisters to get the message across that you\u2019re not being \u201cvoluntold\u201d to do these chores anymore.", "NTA", "NTA. They're giving away **your** time as if it were theirs.", "NTA, but do you live with your parents?  They shouldn't be doing that.  1. you are not a professional handyman and 2. They have a lot of nerve volunteering your time.  Your dad should be telling them to stop it!  No, you were not out of line, they are.  You are fine the way you said it.", "NTA, they are way out of line.", "Simply agree to everything and don't do it. they will learn eventually.  don't argue.  Agree to everything and then move on.   What can they do?  \"Sure.  I'll do it.\"   Where is he?  Sorry.  Can't do it.", "handled it better how?, the band aid needed to be ripped and that's what you did and, IMO, you need to be more stern about this.\n\nNTA, if your mom/sister want to help people, it should be them, not you", "This is an excellent example of women seeing men as expendable worker bees or a resource object.\n\nTell your mom and sister your going rate for helping people is $100 hour.\nNTA.", "NTA. You handled that fine. Maybe could have been firmer. Were it me, I'd say \"from this moment forward, assume that my schedule is booked. You can tell them to call me, and I'll see if I have time for it. But often, the answer will be no, and that is going to be ok. Also, any labor you volunteer me for in the future without my express permission, I will assume that you in fact will be completing this labor yourself.\"\n\nWhy aren't your mom & sister helping Mrs. Jones themselves?", "NTA. That\u2019s awful and I\u2019m sorry they\u2019re doing this to you. Stop taking their calls. dad\u2019s too. And stop showing up to do their projects they volunteered you for. After a few weeks, they\u2019ll reach out to you.", "OP, text your mom and sister on a group chat. \"Do not ever volunteer me for anything again. The answer I'll always give is no, to you. I will, however, respond to people that YOU yourself can go and help them. Then, YOU can be expected to come to their place and help. I know it probably feels good to volunteer me to do things, but moving forward you can feel good by doing it yourself.\" Then, stick to it! \"My mom said I can clean out your garage? Actually, mom and sister were so excited to help you do it. They should be there at noon.\" \"Mom and sister, Mrs. Jones is expecting you to help clean out her garage at noon. Don't be late.\"", "Those two gals need to learn about TaskRabbit. If their neighbors are so important to them, *they* can pony up the money to take care of the work. In OP's case I would have long ago told mum and sis to fuck off.", "Get in touch with each of these people you volunteer with and tell them if they want your help they can call you directly and work with your schedule other wise you won't show up.\n\nYou can also block your mom and sister it's perfectly OK to do", "You don't even need more context. NTA, at all. Your mom and sister want to look to their community and have no problem exploiting you to do it.", "Tell them NO!  NO means NO.  The neighbors need to start googling handymen around the area.  They don't cost that much.  I am a single woman and I don't ask the neighbor next door to come over and fix things.  I call a handyman.  You need to tell them you fix cars, not houses!  Tell mom and sis the next time they volunteer your time, you are charging the neighbors and they better be aware of that.", "This sounds like a business opportunity tbh", "Hell yes. Op listen to Boeing367-80. Great advice and great response.", "If they are that concerned about helping and can't coz it's \"man's work\" then they need to start paying for a handyman to come do those jobs.", "I pay one if I need things replaced, built, or repaired.  Op needs to tell them to tell the neighbors to fork out money for one.  They are not that expensive at all.", "Or they can get tf over it and roll up their sleeves. \n\nYoutube has tutorials on *everything.*", "Meant the mum and the sis. They are super generous with OP's time and skills. Let's see how generous they are when they have to pay for that expertise. Are these neighbors even directly asking for OP to come help? Or are they just sharing problems that they have in conversations and OP's family then jump in and volunteer his services?\n\nBut yeah, agree with you. Next time they ask OP to do something, he should ask to get paid."]}
