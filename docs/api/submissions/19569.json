You need a break to relax. They also volunteer you without your permission that\u2019s messed up", "NTA. It's wrong for your mom and sister to volunteer you for anything without your consent even if you weren't busy with anything yourself. Besides, if they really wanted to help these supposedly immobile old people, I think they could do it themselves; it's not like cleaning the garage is something that takes your own unique skills to accomplish.", "NTA, go cold turkey.  No help at all, just don't show up", "NTA. \nYour mum and sister clearly lack respect for your time and space. Nobody is entitled to your help and they seem to have forgotten that.", "To add more context:\n\nI work full time in an auto shop, and occassionally part time with my buddies farm. Thats why I say working full time and part time. Because I have two jobs. Or at least I did before I quit the second one to have more time to myself.", "NTA\n\nYou're a grown adult with your own life and responsibilities. It's disrespectful of your mother and sister to tell others you'd be free to help before even asking you. You did the right thing letting them know that too. If you're feeling like you could've handled it better you can always re-open the conversation and explain what you meant/how it's impacting you.", "NTA. It's easy to volunteer other people for things and then look like the neighborhood angels while it costs them no time, money, or effort. THEY can help Mrs. Jones with things if they think it's so important. And I get that not everyone knows how to DIY things, but they can either Google it or pay a repairman if they want to be helpful. They have no right to volun-told you for things.", "NTA you handled it reasonably at first but by this point with how long it\u2019s drug on id have told them to go fuck themselves", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou handled that well - THEY need to learn.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo make a new rule: YOu ignore ALL things they volunter you for. And you consider things you are asked to do, and then give the answer YOU like.", "NTA. Could you have handled it better? Maybe, but they put you on the spot and that is on them. If they keep doing it just don't show up, maybe then they will get the message.", "NTA\n\nStop doing absolutely anything any family members volunteer you for at all.  Period.  You need to train your Mom and and Sister to not speak for you.\n\nGoing forward, tell everyone, \"Sorry, I'm not able to help you.  Please talk to Mom and Sister.  They may be able to help you themselves.\"", "NTA.  They're presuming on your goodwill. Doing so makes them seem like the thoughtful, good guys.\n\n It's time to enforce the fact that \"No.\" is a complete sentence that requires no further elaboration.", "NTA \n\nFrom now on, if the person that needs help does not contact you themselves,  the answer should always be NO. You are an adult, not living at home, have your own life, and work 1.5 jobs. You don't have time. They can help out themselves.", "It sounds like you are getting into a viscous cycle of trying to get your Mom and sister to stop volunteering you. I suggest that you simple stop any discussion and just say sorry but no, I'm busy. Don't provide any other reasons, calmly say over and over again...sorry but I'm not able to help, sorry but I have other plans, sorry but the answer is still no. You can do this, good luck.", "NTA your mom and sister have no right volunteering your time then making you feel guilty when you say no.\n\nI would tell them from now on if I want to help I will let you know. If I don\u2019t mention it then assume I am busy. I have a life and you don\u2019t get\nTo dictate what I do or don\u2019t do! You want to volunteer someone volunteer yourself.", "NTA thats so selfish and disrespectful of them to essentially manipulate you like that. What you do with your own time is your own and not theirs to try to play with cause they want to put on airs.\n\nI would Tell them if they cared so much why can't THEY help? Or you could try to go to the neighbors directly and tell them that your mom and sister are lying about your availability.", "NTA. They can do all of these things if they think they're so important. You have been far more patient and polite than I and most other people would have been.", "Absolutely NTA. They both want credit for volunteering without doing the actual work. Draw a hard boundary. If you can help and want to help then do so otherwise when they call or text the only answer to give is \"I have personal plans that can not be altered that day\". Those plans maybe to sleep in but that's your personal choice to do so on your day off.", "NTA sounds like you need to go LC with your sister and mother for a period. \n\nI would probably write something like: I am working a full-time job with long hours, in addition to trying to be a good person by helping out when I can, but having my time volunteered is making me feel stressed and like you don't respect me as a person. The only times you contact me are to inform of another commitment you have made on my behalf, and I don't feel like you care for my well-being. This truly saddens me.  \nTo take care of myself, I will no longer be helping out, nor accept any volunteering you do on my behalf.  \n\nIf it doesn't help, block them until you feel comfortable saying no, if people ask why you didn't show up. Just tell them that your family must have forgotten AGAIN that you have other obligations. You are in no way responsible for the agreements they make! \n\nRemember, on a plain, they always ask you to put on your own mask first before helping other, you need to do this in your everyday life as well. \n\nHope it gets better. \ud83d\ude4f", "NTA.  The answer is just no to anything you are voluntold to do that  you can't volunteer for.  No excuses or reasons.  They can volunteer themselves.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
