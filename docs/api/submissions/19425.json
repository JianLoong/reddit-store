Your father who was NOT married to your mother at the time of his death. I'm astonished she got anything at all!\n\nNTA and don't give her anything.", "NTA - \n\nDon't set yourself on fire trying to keep others warm. From your comments your living situation is a lot worse than hers with a ton of student debt and living in a studio apartment. She has a ton of money on her own, her own inheritance from the situation, and an entire other spouse making money. She's just being extremely greedy and I highly recommend you not give her the $15K. It'd be put to much better use going towards your debt than to sit in her bank account so she can \" retire early \".", "Nta. She doesn\u2019t need the money. She doesn\u2019t need to be taken care of. She has a good job, savings, house, car and she\u2019s married. It\u2019s not your job to take care of her. You have bills of your own that you need to take care of to set you up for your future.", "INFO, why would you give her anything? It was your inheritance, and by your own admission, she has more than enough.  \n\n> I'm sure I am the idiot because I don't even have 30k in the bank.", "NTA. Ask around for a good financial advisor and take their advice. Your dad wanted you to have all of this money, or he would have left some to his *ex*-wife. \n\nRespect the wishes of the dead, and keep the money. Your mum is a manipulator and has you well trained. It might be worth investing some of that money into breaking the hold she has over you.", "I was wondering the same thing.  It sounds as if the mom has plenty of money.  She isn't hurting financially.  She is doing better than most people.", "I do want her to retire early. The more I learn about her finances, the more I understand she could probably retire right now if she really wanted to but, that thinking makes me feel like a selfish son. I'm also $75k in debt from student loans and live in a studio apartment so maybe she's a little more greedy than I am selfish.", "I felt I had alot of money and could bare to give her some. She said it would help her retire early. I'm 32 and shes 59.", "I know! Lived paycheck to paycheck until this point. I can barely fathom it. $30,000 is ALOT of money to me.", "Especially since it sounds like OP just finished school and has not started their career.", "She's being manipulatives with money and you seem to be aware of this. \n\nDon't give her money when she's doing it to be greedy. She's fine and you need to get yourself out of debt.\n\nAlso, you aren't being selfish. Not a tiny bit. It is not selfish to not give a financially well-off person MORE money than they need. She would bleed you dry if she could. No parent should make their child feel the way that she makes you feel. \n\nNo one can tell you how to have a relationship with your mother, but know you aren't being selfish and a normal mother should want their son to thrive. \n\nNTA but the amount you give her should be $0. Take care of yourself.", "So use your money to pay those loans off first. It\u2019s insane to hold onto debt and give your inheritance away. Then look at what you\u2019ve got left. Frankly, I think you absolutely should not give her money since money is much more important to help a young person get started in life and it will grow in value much more for you than her.", "Don\u2019t give her a cent, she got her own share and is doing very well finanically.

She's got plenty of her own. Use your money to get all of your debt paid off ASAP, so you're not paying massive amounts of interest any more. Then put the rest of your money into savings and investments for your own retirement.", "Why do you have student loans if she took care of you? I\u2019m assuming that she didn\u2019t pay for your higher education and instead saved her money for retirement. Any money that she spent on you before age 18 is money that she was responsible to spend on a child that she chose to have. You should not be asked to demonstrate your love for your mom with money, that\u2019s a manipulative thing for her to say when if anything she should be helping you out.", "Your dad \"took care\" of her to the extent he thought was reasonable.  He wanted you to have what left you for yourself."]}
