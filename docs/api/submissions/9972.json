Oof this one is just a difficult situation. I could totally be wrong, but to me it sounds like it just caught her off guard.

The article sets up a strawman.\n\nTrying to eliminate social stigma against fat people is not the same as trying to tell people it\u2019s totally fine to eat 3kg of chocolate whenever you want to.  It\u2019s more along the lines of criticizing the characterization of fatness as gorging on 3kg of chocolate as an example of stigmatizing language.\n\nHealthy at Every Size is not Every Size is Healthy.  Encouraging people to try to live healthy lives at whatever weight they are at is not encouraging people to gain weight.\n\nI\u2019m not a dyed-in-the-wool supporter of those movements, by the way.  I criticize things they say sometimes, and I\u2019m open to criticism of them.  I do roll my eyes at the way they are frequently characterized and the fear mongering around them."]}
