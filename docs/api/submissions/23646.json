So, my parents own a beach house which my friend, Jess (F25), her boyfriend, Harry (M26) and myself (F25) were planning on going to for a week. Our road trip there is coming up in less than two weeks and this morning Jess texted me to ask if her friend, Heather, can come as well. Turns out her friend is going through a breakup and Jess thought bringing her to the beach house would be a good solution to cheer her up. The thing is, the place is pretty small, my parents bought it for themselves and so it's a one bedroom and already as three people the place was going to be pretty cramped with Jess and Harry sleeping in the living room. I told her about this and she said that we can make it work and that Heather can bring her own air mattress and that she won't take up much room. I told Jess I felt as though this might be awkward as I've never met Heather before and she'll basically have to tag along with us everywhere as well as go for the 5 hour road trip. Jess told me that Heather won't be a problem and is very nice.  \n\nI initially reluctantly agreed to this because it didn't seem like Jess would take no for an answer but I guess I gave off the vibe that I wasn't okay with this because Jess went on to ask if I was actually feeling good about this. I told her that honestly having a stranger I never met invited to a trip I've been looking forward to is a real downer on my trip. On top of that, she's going to have to come to everything with us because I only have the one set of keys and I don't want to trust a stranger on her own with the keys. I ended up telling her that ideally, I wouldn't want Heather there but that Jess seemed as though she had already invited her and so we'll make it work. Jess is now mad at me saying that I should have just been upfront and that now things are going to be awkward on our trip and that she can't uninvite Heather. \n\nI probably could have been more upfront but I feel as though I brought up valid reasons as to why she would be a bad fit on the trip and in general I feel as though it's poor etiquette to try and invite a stranger to someone elses  house at the last minute.

You\u2019re the one responsible for your parents house.  Jess is not.  Heather can be uninvited, or Jess and her bf can stay home and help her through her breakup.", "NTA. Your friend Jess has a lot of nerve. You did tell her that you thought it would be awkward, then you gave in. Then she told her friend, today, that she could come, then she asked you if you were really okay and you repeated that you were actually uncomfortable, and now it's your fault? No. Jess and her friend are not five year olds\u2014her friend's hopes have been up for less than one day. Jess is an adult who ccould easily tell her friend, \"look, I jumped the gun, I realize that my host would be uncomfortable and I should respect that. My bad. We'll do something when I get back.\" If she thinks her friend is so down in the dumps that she should not leave her, then she needs to stay with her.", "NTA\n\nInviting someone else to another person's house, especially if they're someone they've never met, is so incredibly rude. And it sounds like Jess pressured you into it. On top of that, she has the nerve to get upset at you when she asked if you were actually okay with it and gave an honest answer. Don't ask questions you wont like the answer to.\n\nHonestly, you might be better off just cancelling the trip at this point. I can already tell it's going to be an incredibly awkward and tense couple days.", "NTA.  Yes, you could have said no quicker to Jess's rude request, but Jess might also have been able to refrain from making such a rude request.", "NTA\n\nJess can and should uninvite Heather.\n\nYou have every right to say no to this.", "NTA. Yeh you should have said exactly how you felt instead of agreeing but it seems Jess got really pushy about inviting Heather and that is not fair to you. Remember that is your family's house, not Jess's so you are responsible.", "NTA. I mean\u2026 she is right that you should have been upfront with her and just told her no to Heather coming. But her request to invite a stranger without properly talking to you about it was not appropriate", "NTA. You DID tell her upfront. Your friend is being unreasonable.", "NTA. Why are you wrong for not wanting a person you didn't invite on a trip? \n\nI understand she wanted to cheer her friend up, then make other accommodations and everything would be great! No worries now.\n\nBut, expecting someone else to be okay with your actions is sometimes asking too much. You have to be on pins and needles as to not upset someone, you don't know, from feeling bad and/or excluded. How was this ever going to come out okay?", "You are NTA for not wanting a stranger coming along in your trip. You should have been upfront from the beginning and that is your fault. \n\nStill, even if a stranger, I would prefer a 4 people vacation that spending my whole time there with a couple. You are probably very comfortable with both Jess and her bf, but I would still like having someone else to hang out.

You have to do that, and say what you mean, and not let Jess steamroll you. And yes, she CAN BE univited.", "INFO: were these two separate conversations?

Lol", "ESH.\n\nJess is the 1st AH.  Guests don't ask to invite other guests to someone's home, especially someone they've never met.  And if you do ask, you take the first 'no' for an answer and not badger the host until you get a 'yes'.\n\nYou're the 2nd AH for agreeing to it.  Yes Jess badgered you until you said yes but you could have shut her down.   And seeing as you didn't want Heather to come, you should have been more direct with Jess and after the second \"ask\", and suggested she stay home and keep Heather company because you didn't want another guest at the beach house.", "NTA. I would have reluctantly sort of agreed like you did too. I think it's kind of rude to invite a stranger to someone else's place.

Either Jess uninvites Heather, or you do.  Jess is hoping that you won't want her to look bad.  That's too bad.  She overstepped and now she has to deal with it.  \n\nAlso, stop hinting around.  Saying no is not rude.  Heather cannot come on the trip.  6 words and you're done.", "'I probably could have been more upfront\"\n\nI agree. No,followed by reason means something very different than the reason alone.\n\nHowever I think the greater fault lies with your friend.

Fuck that.", "NTA and just tell her your parents said no", "Heather: he just broke up with me, I feel so depressed and sad.\n\nJess:  I know you can come on holiday to a tiny cottage I don\u2019t own that\u2019s 5 hours away, with someone who you have never met and I didn\u2019t ask permission from.

Just some poor communication.", "Based on the title I was sure you were not gonna be the asshole, but YTA here. Your friend didn\u2019t invite anyone against your will, she asked you and you said you were okay with something you knew you were not okay with.\n\nThe time to present her with those valid reasons you mentioned was when she asked you the first time. This is a mess of your own making. Do not make the fact that you couldn\u2019t speak up for yourself heathers problem when you\u2019re at the beach house. She doesn\u2019t need to deal with that bullshit on top of her breakup and will 100% be able to tell you didn\u2019t want her there since you\u2019re apparently not great at hiding it.", "She was wrong to even ask about a stranger coming on vacation with you, but you agreed.  It's on you now.", "ESH.\n\nYTA for not having a spine and just saying \"No\" when you felt uncomfortable to begin with. Sorry, but it's true. You got roped in against your will and then had an issue with it later.\n\nYour friend is an AH for pushing to have her friend come when she could tell you were not ok with it to begin with.", "I would say NTA but also you did say she could come even if you were pressured. Id say just go on the trip with her I\u2019m sure she\u2019s a nice girl if she\u2019s friends with your friend. It\u2019s okay to have rules with her like she has to bring her own bed and pay for just as much, even that she can\u2019t have a key, those are okay boundaries. Maybe suggest she drives separately if you\u2019re driving or whatever you feel like you need to be more comfortable", "ESH. Speak your mind and be up front with people! It's your parent's home and you have the say of who can come. I'd never want to stay a  week with someone I never met. You mucked it up by agreeing and then saying your true feeling later. Heather is an AH too for pushing when you clearly didn't want to say yes\n\nShe absolutely can uninvite Heather lol. It's 2 weeks out and she has no money invested.\n\nBut, you'd then tick off your friend and it'll still be awkward. I say now to suck it up have the 4-person trip. Hopefully Heather is cool", "ESH. Inviting guests to someone else's house is the height of rudeness but once you agreed you became an asshole for retracting the invitation.", "ESH\n\nYou relented.

If she wants to invite Heather to her own family beach house then good for her.", "Y TA for allowing yourself to be talked into doing something that you didn\u2019t want to do, but NTA for not wanting a stranger to join,\n\nAt this point, she should tell her friend that your parents have a capacity limit and unfortunately it\u2019s not going to work.", "NTA. Jess shouldn't have invited someone else on a trip when it isn't her house. That's deeply entitled. And now she's mad because you're not jumping for joy at her rudeness? Does Jess often take advantage of you, and try to make you feel badly when you say no to her? She sounds like a bad friend.", "Nta. Jess shouldn't have invited her without a firm yes from you. That's on her.", "Nta. You did communicate your feelings with Heather coming. She ignored you and refused to accept no, so she invited said friend, and is now annoyed at you because she didn't listen to you.", "NTA. You did tell her at first that you did not like the idea. She just kept pressuring you. And she had no business inviting her friend in the first place. Jess needs to grow up.", "NTA - Jess is rude af for inviting a complete stranger to your family home . \n\nAlso , how the fuck is making Heather be the fifth wheel in a couple\u2019s getaway going to make her feel better about her breakup?\n\nSounds like Jess just wants to give her friend a free vacation on YOUR trip.", "NTA you told her all the reasons it wouldn\u2019t work and wasn\u2019t a good idea she kept pushing and wouldn\u2019t take no. She absolutely can uninvite her friend that she had no right to invite in the first place. You need to go back and tell her as much and that Heather can\u2019t come. Doesn\u2019t sound like an enjoyable trip", "NAH\n\nLook, this may suck, but the perspective of Jess, the first part was you explaining a problem, and then you two together working through and resolving the problem. I can see how she could have though that you're merely trying to politely suggest her friend may not have a good time, due to the exhausted sleeping arrangements.\n\nGoing forward, if you're not comfortable with the idea, then don't go into details why. \"I'd like this to be an 'us' thing. Maybe next time, after I get to know Heather.\" would have worked well.\n\nI get that learning how to politely say no can be difficult, but now you're facing repercussions of not handling that properly the first time around. Trust me, you're not the only one who learned the hard way.\n\nThe second part is where you're kinda approaching AH territory. Agreeing to have the friend along, then doing an exposition dump on them to tell her you're actually not happy about her +1 being there puts her in a very nasty position. Imagine you were told by someone who invited you over that now because you're there, the whole thing is gonna suck?\n\nI chose not AH, because mishandling the situation does not make you an AH. But no. You didn't do well there.", "Wait,  I'm confused. \n\nIt's your parents house and Jess is 3/4 of the party.  \n\nAre you sure Jess wanted to invite YOU to the beach?\n\nI think you're being used my dear.", "Friend asked. You said yes. This is on you. You should have said no frim the get go.", "YTA\n\nMaking up reasons instead of just saying \u201cI\u2019d rather not,\u201d is not being honest.\n\nYou made the uncomfortable request worse by skirting your own feelings (which were valid. I hate uninvited guests too, and you didn\u2019t invite her). But once you allowed the invitation to be extended, you should have stood by your decision as a host. \n\nIt sucks that your friend wasn\u2019t accepting your reluctance as indication and that she \u201c*seemed* like she wouldn\u2019t take no for an answer,\u201d but according to your story, you didn\u2019t actually tell her what *you* wanted until the very last minute. \n\nIt is rude to invite someone the way she did, but you missed your opportunity to handle it maturely.", "NAH\n\nShe can ask, you can say no. You didn\u2019t say no because of feeling pressured, then you expressed your discomfort, she got annoyed - all of this is ok. \nIt\u2019s ok that the two of you messed up communication, that\u2019s how you find your way to doing it better and in more satisfying ways.\n\nNot for nothing, but exactly how fun was it actually going to be to hang out as the fifth wheel to a couple? \n\nI have yet to find that hanging out in threes is all that fabulous of an experience.\n\nMaybe Heather will be a good balance to have around.  You might have more fun with her there.", "Sounds like Jess is trying to be a good friend to Heather but going about it all wrong. She prob thinks it\u2019ll be fun and cheer Jess up but the issue is that it\u2019s not her place - it\u2019s not even your place. \n\nI think the mistake was saying yes in the first place. Honestly, I rather cancel the whole weekend then let her come up. Say your parents decided to loan it to couple of family friends visiting from out of the country.", "NTA. No means no. Jess does not get to tell you what will work in your house.\n\nJess 100% can uninvite Heather and you WERE upfront with Jess, she just chose to steamroll you. She saw you were not comfortable with it, but insisted anyways. This is 100% on Jess. I would cancel the trip altogether, and just go by myself", "NTA cheering up her friend should make you uncomfortable at YOUR parents beach house.", "NTA. You need to go ahead and cancel them both. If the trip goes ahead, it's guaranteed to be a disaster. Don't set yourself up for a disaster...", "NTA Jess is entitled. She seems to be the type of person who uses her friends to her benefit. I'd be willing to bet she had invited her friend before even asking you, assuming she could manipulate you into saying yes. I'm sure your parents wouldn't appreciate you bringing someone you don't even know to their beach house. My dad has a condo on the beach and my family never goes unless he's there. Drop your user friends and find friends that reciprocate your generosity and effort into the friendship.", "NTA and you can 100% uninvite someone who you aren\u2019t comfortable bringing on your trip.

Still not too late to cancel the trip if you're that uncomfortable with her coming along.", "Why do I get the feeling that she actually invited the friend BEFORE asking OP?", "Same day but at different times of day so I guess two conversations", "Sorry but when your no is being ignored and the person continues to insist and talk over you and your objections it comes a time when you ll say anything just to get them off your back and have some peace and quiet.\n\n\nJess is the huge huge ah - you don't invite someone to another person's house and you don't insist if you already made the blunder when they say they aren't comfortable with it.\n\nNTA op", "Jess is a huge ah here.

ESH for the reasons you stated.  The only change I would have is if Jess didn\u2019t ask Heather yet and was asking for permission first it makes her less of an AH but still rude.", "And yet she still said \u201cyes it is fine for her to come\u201d. \n\nJess can\u2019t do anything but take her at her word. Was she pushy? Absolutely. But OP should have said no.", "OP said yes because they felt pressured into it, not because they wanted to. That's the same as doing something against your will. Jess picked up on this and then got upset that she pressured OP into allowing Heather to come. Should OP have said no? Of course, but hindsight is also 20/20. Blaming OP for this is just victim blaming.", "Victim blaming is a hell of a reach. Nobody is a \u201cvictim\u201d in this situation. Nobody has been hurt. OP is just going to have to adjust her vacation plans. \n\nOP not being able to stand up for herself against pressure and say no is exactly why I said this is a mess of her own making. She needs to learn how to stand her ground, especially on trivial issues like this. If she can\u2019t stand up for herself on something this small and then just sulks about the outcome, she\u2019s gonna have a pretty rough life when it comes to bigger stuff.", "Jess needs to learn not to be an ah when someone is already doing her a favor and take no for an answer without insisting and giving unwanted 'solutions' .\n\nNTA op"]}
