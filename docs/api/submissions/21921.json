They could have had a movie night, they could have gone hiking, could have done a craft activity together.

Would you assume you needed swimming costumes, shorts, vests and flip flops?", "She chose to ditch her son by not having a bedroom for him in a 2 bedroom house so \ud83e\udd37\n\nWhat do you expect?", "Come to hang out in the lounge because she had given away his room? I wouldn\u2019t be keen to stay in those circumstances either.", "A guest isn't someone who stays for 3 MONTHS.\n\nThat's a temporary custody situation or something else entirely. And if it is a \"stay for the summer\" kind of deal ... then get them an effing trundle bed or something instead of \"my kid sleeps on the couch for 3 months.\"\n\nWhy the eff would I go home to a mother that gave away my room and BED and won't clearly communicate with me?", "And mom chose not to have a bed for OP to sleep in.\n\nYou can't blame someone for being essentially kicked out of their own space to be reluctant to return.", "Anyone who says \"would of\" is automatically an ass.\n\nYou're ignoring the fact that mom gave away his bedroom for the summer. Why would he go to her house to be treated like a barely welcome guest?", "I knew they were asking people to stop moving there- why would they want the tourism to stop too? Most people in nice destinations would prefer not to have to share their own slice of heaven (knowing this as someone who lives on a tourist destination island), but it\u2019s also understood that\u2019s how the local economy continues to do well.", "Think you might be on the wrong post since this is irrelevant. Perhaps try r/Hawaii", "Let me add going to Hawaii without you is a dick move", " Your Mom is the adult in this situation, she's literally punished you for not sucking it up that you lost your room for 3 months and don't want to sleep on a couch.", "\nSo she needs to bribe him (with a fun trip) to spend time with her? Otherwise, he isn't going to go to her on her week?\nWhat if it was a surprise? \n\n\"what's in it for me\" attitude\n\nSo he misses a trip.", "That\u2019s my first thought too! \u201cBring clothes\u201d is a very unspecific instruction! What if he didn\u2019t pack swimming clothes? What if he didn\u2019t pack a sun hat? What if he threw some \u201clounging around the house\u201d clothes in a bag, because that\u2019s what he expected to do? Nothing to wear for dinner out? What about ID for getting on the plane? What about entertainment (headphones/books etc) on the flight? Yes, most things can be bought at airports and at destination, but it\u2019s such a hassle (and expensive!!)! I rather know what I\u2019m packing for, thank you! NTA", "The way this is described, it\u2019s a 50/50 if she just wanted him to watch the house.", ">Don't think you were ever going to go with her tbh. She just wanted to control where you were and possible as indicated flag to you that it was your choice not to come\n\nYep. Doesn't feel nice to type but when mother never mentioned \"passport\" \"ID\" \"nice clothes suited to warm weather\" \"swimwear'', OP wasn't going to Hawaii, it was a shitty and cruel manipulation tactic", "What specific items do you need in Hawaii that you don't use during the summer in the contiguous 48?", ">Uhhh you kinda need to pack clothes to stay at someone\u2019s house for a week\n\nThat's his own house and likely has clothes there too. Otherwise, this story would make zero sense.", "I think OP read the signal of his room having been given away for the summer quite clearly - that he is not particularly welcome in his mom's home, and she does not care about his needs or well-being.\n\nHis mom is being a passive aggressive asshole to her son.  You need to tell people if you plan on going on a week long vacation in a different climate before it happens.  The kid reacted the way anyone should to the situation - he noped out and maintained his original plans.", "How is he suppose to even know what kind of clothes to bring? He even said she\u2019s mentioned her next vacation maybe being local. She needs to be an actual adult and use her words instead of being more childish than the actual child. Don\u2019t expect someone to cancel plans without good reason, common sense.", "Yea I understand that, he had plans with his cousins, he would have abandoned the plans with cousins had he known Hawaii was on the line, but it\u2019s not worth it for him if he\u2019s just gonna spend it at home with his mom. I think that\u2019s fair but I also think it\u2019s fair she\u2019s kinda hurt by it. Like I don\u2019t think it\u2019s wrong to go for the most interesting plans for yourself, but I also don\u2019t think you can complain when the people you don\u2019t pick do something more interesting than you thought.", "I think we're missing loads of context here. Mom specifically mentions she's off from work that week AND asks to bring clothes, an atypical request judging from OP's reaction.\n\nMom isn't the strong communicator it seems, but OP also seems pretty thick for ignoring pretty clear signals that mom wasn't planning on letting OP sit in the living room all week staring at the walls.", "If the options are sleep in a bed and hang out with cousins at his dad\u2019s, or sleep on the couch and stay home all day at his mom\u2019s, why wouldn\u2019t he choose the option that at least has a bed for him? All his mom had to say was \u201cwe won\u2019t be staying at home\u201d if she wanted to surprise him and not mention the trip, and he probably would have gone over. OP made it clear the biggest issue with him visiting was going to be the sleeping arrangements.", "It's not a what is in it for me. It's am I gonna be uncomfortable by spending time with you? Him not wanting to sleep on a couch for multiple days is not unreasonable in my opinion. If this was not going to be the case, the mom should have told him that.", "He already had plans you melt he wanted to know what his mum had planned before cancelling them.", "When he thinks he's going back to sleep on a couch, yeah. Giving away someone's room for 3 months is a deal and something OP does have the right to be angry about. There's literally no place for him at mom's, so mom likely has to put in some work here to rebuild some trust. This did not help", "Exactly. Hawaii is amazing for hiking as well, so he might want to pack a good pair of shoes and some clothes for that, if he likes to hike. Or surfing gear, snorkeling gear,... . With zero packing instruction, OP might very well have missed out on some amazing holiday activities simply because he didn't bring the right clothes. That vacations was pretty close to doomed even if he had come, imo", "I didn't even think about that, but if she was willing to give up on deposits or the entire cost of flights and hotel rooms just like that, she might not have had them booked for him in the fist place", "If they're in the states, no passport needed for Hawaii, it's in the US.", "It\u2019s not about getting something, it\u2019s about not wanting to be uncomfortable in his own home. Kid has someone else in his room, in his bed. The mom should care more about her kid if she wants him to enjoy spending time with her.", "It isnt really an \"option,\" there is a custody agreement in place and OP refused to abide, despite it being mom's time. That could lead to legal trouble for dad. Unfortunately the sleeping arrangements at mom's house dont negate the agreement and refusing to go back isn't an option for a minor. OP doesnt get to decide any of this.", "That and it\u2019s literally a house without his own space. Not exactly the definition of a home.", "It isnt an option, OP is a minor and there is a legal agreement in place.", "I thought that although officially not needed it was still considered best practice in terms of TSA, dealing with local police, and just a fallback in case other ID ends up lost", "Nope.", "only if your a person of color in this country, unfortunately.   White people don\u2019t typically have to do this :(", "Local police that would be shitty about an out of state ID are going to treat a passport as even more fake because they're not commonly used here, especially between states. Like only 56% of Americans even have a passport at all."]}
