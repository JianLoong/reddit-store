I was with my dad on a Sunday where my mom texted me to bring clothes to her house. I asked why and if she had any plans. She said not to worry about it and that it shouldn\u2019t matter if she has plans or not because it\u2019s her week to have me as my parents have 50/50 custody over me. She also said that she\u2019s on vacation time from work but never mentioned about going anywhere.

I tell her that for starters, my cousin is staying in MY room because we have no guest bedroom, and that I don\u2019t want to sleep on the couch in the living room or on the floor (I am a big guy as well so the couch or the floor wouldn\u2019t be as comfortable). Also, my cousin would be staying until days before I start school, and I didn\u2019t want to not have my room for months before I start school again. After a few minutes of bickering back and forth, she eventually said that she wants me to go to my cousins.\n\nAfter about an hour, she texts back again saying that I should bring clothes. I ask if she has plans and that I need to know because not only do I not want to sit in the house all day (not even in my own room) doing nothing, and that I already have plans with cousins. She snaps and after, I eventually give up wanting to end this argument. I tell her she can pick me up at the end of the day, but she refuses and says I can just go to my cousins. I tell her that I chose the latter and then she gets mad again. I end the conversation by telling her and I quote, \u201cLet me know when you\u2019re done being mad at me.\u201d \n\nI am now at my cousins and after looking at things on sale on Amazon, I notice delivered packages a few days earlier (me and my mom share the same account), and they were supplies for the beach.

That being said, you are 16, and still learning how a healthy communication between adults SHOULD work. Your mother is a grown woman and its frustrating to see her behave like someone your age. It's also not very appealing that she demand she has you for the week when she hasn't hashed out the idea of giving your room back. Why cant can't cousin sleep on the couch while you're there?

If you didn't want to sleep on the couch you could always have asked her to buy a blow up mattress or a trundle bed and share the room with your cousin, it wouldn't have killed you to share a room for a week when a lot of kids don't even get their own bedroom, let alone two bedrooms.

They could have had a movie night, they could have gone hiking, could have done a craft activity together. Plans don't need to be grand, and once she realised he wanted to know whether sleeping on a couch for a week would be worth cancelling plans with family, she should have been mature enough to explain. And once he agreed to go to her house if she picked him up, she wouldn't have changed her mind, if she actually wanted him there.

Expecting you to spend time at her place with no bedroom, when you have a bedroom in your dads house, is insane, and offers you no privacy. Frankly, it would also violate your parents custody agreement. Your mom may have realised this situation and thought the solution this week was to surprise take you to Hawaii, but it seems like she was the one who got angry at you for having legitimate reasons for not wanting to come.

They are treating you like a child, not like the 16 year old you\u2019ve become. \n\nWay too controlling and not telling you the truth is an issue here. Your parent needs to treat you appropriately for your age, including respecting what you are doing. If they want you to do something else, now is not the time for a surprise.

I have a child your age and am divorced and would never think to do this to my child because I always want them to feel like they have a place in my/their home.\n\nAs for the communication, I can\u2019t understand why your mother can\u2019t just say what\u2019s going on and they way she is choosing to communicate with you is very childish.

Is it feasible to set that up for yourself long term? I think perhaps that might be best for you if your mother is going to not make space for you, talk to you as if she is the child and then storm away without explanation like a child having a tantrum-it sounds like you don\u2019t need to be wrapped up with that at your age. \n\nI don\u2019t agree with other comments about people invalidating your feelings just because you\u2019re a teenager.

I know because i damn well cut off my own mother at that age even tho she had 50% custody and court ordered visitation rights every 2 weeks. \n\ni cant get over the user saying \u201cUHM idk where you heard that\u201d  BITCH I LIVED IT \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "Not everyone considers surprises a good thing. I think that great that you would be okay with extra clothes but I would need to be way more prepared then this.  Surprises cause a lot of people a lot of anxiety.", "I had no idea, thanks!", "NTA. Your mom is a petulant child who wanted to make you jealous/regret not coming over to her place. The good thing is that at 16m, you can basically choose which parent you live/spend your time with and the child support is adjusted to the new custody arrangement, assuming you are in the US. However, don\u2019t be petty about exercising this right like your mother would be. Just do what is best for you.", "NTA. Your mom was being a complete ass. You're not an adult, but you're also not a child. She has 50/50 custody, and gave your room to someone else to use for 1/12 of the time you are with her.\n          \nShe is also super manipulative. I'm sorry you missed out on Hawaii, but you are also missing out on some major manipulations.", "NTA. Your mother refused to tell you her plans even after you had explained why you  weren\u2019t enthusiastic about sleeping on a couch. Then she blows up at you and goes on holiday without you. Seems pretty immature for a grown adult.", "ITT: people expecting a 16 year old to have a more attuned worldview and communication skills than his own parents combined", "Nta, sounds like you kind of have a fractured relationship with your mom and I could understand not wanting to have to sleep on the floor and sit in the house and do nothing since it seems she's made to do that in the past. It looks like she hasn't built up the trust with you to understand that things might actually be good.", "What the hell good does it to tell you to bring clothes with you, if she doesn't tell you what *sort* of clothes to bring with you? What good does it do for you to bring clothes with you, if she doesn't also tell you to bring your suitcase?\n\nHonestly, it's obvious that she's had this trip planned for awhile -- last-minute tickets to Hawaii would have been hella expensive -- and it sounds as though she was deliberately setting this up so that she wouldn't have to take you with her.", "It's a 5-6 hour flight from California.", "This is insane. Mom told OP to pack & insinuated a trip. He let her know (last minute) that he won\u2019t be there for mom\u2019s week. She tried to get him there over & over again and he refused. Maybe she should\u2019ve disclosed the surprise but i also wouldn\u2019t wanna feel like OP is only spending time w me to go to Hawaii or that I\u2019m bribing him. \nIn terms of \u201cshe wants you to for sure\u201d sounds deeply personal. His mom didn\u2019t send him pictures or anything, he went to find out where she was. She just went about her life as normal, since he said he didn\u2019t wanna be there. \nOf course there\u2019s a better way to go about this but mom is def not an asshole & OP will be for \u201clashing out\u201d (which.. interesting word choice, no?)", "Generally it\u2019s because they\u2019re the second comment. High up enough to get upvotes but not so high as to attract attention. Usually. They also go in a few comments deep on the top comment.", "Why is a good question to ask. She told him to bring clothes. How can he dress for whatever they are doing without knowing what it is? Its a shit \"lesson\" because the mom chose not to communicate. Its only a good \"lesson\" if you prefer to train your kids to be robots who obey no matter what rather than teach them to be well adjusted people.\n\nPeople who attempt to stop their children's curiosity are despicable. I know its annoying. My little brother was born when I was 16. That doesn't change how damaging it is to crush their curiosity. They also might give more of a shit about doing something properly if they know why. People shouldn't parent if they dont like children. Children start off knowing nothing. They need to ask why.", "Flying standby can be very affordable.", "I mean, do you want a surprise or do you actually want your kid with you?", "It is a serious problem for a parent to give away a child\u2019s room to another relative, with nowhere for that child to sleep. A 16 year old boy can\u2019t get a good night\u2019s sleep tossing and turning with his neck cranked up on a headrest. \n\nThere is nowhere for him to sleep at her house. That\u2019s her most basic function as a parent -food and shelter. \n\nWhen he told her this was a problem, she did not work with him to find a solution. Apparently, she just told him he was wrong to be upset about it. \n\nWhen he told her it was a problem that she wanted him to bring clothes and come to her house, where there was nowhere to sleep and she wouldn\u2019t tell him what her plans were, again, she did not address the problem. She told him he was wrong to be upset. \n\nThis wasn\u2019t teenage angst or stubbornness. This was a teenage boy rejected by his divorced mother, making him feel like an outsider while she gave his space away to his cousin. If she took his cousin to Hawaii, instead of him, that stupid, selfish woman may have lost her son forever. She basically replaced her son with his cousin, in her life. \n\nThat\u2019s a twisted thing to do to a child.\n\nAlso, if you say you\u2019ll do something, you do it. You don\u2019t make plans with someone and then cancel them when something better comes up. \n\nYet, it\u2019s common for divorced parents to constantly force their children to break plans with their friends because one or the other parent decides to do something else. They break plans with their friends so many times that eventually they stop getting invited. \n\nDecent people coordinate and communicate plans with their children. Decent people don\u2019t give their children\u2019s room away to someone else do they feel unwanted at home.", "His manipulative af mom who should be offering at least some level of consistency in his life could have at least said something along the lines of \u201cit\u2019s a surprise\u201d or \u201cyou won\u2019t have to worry about having a room or bed\u201d, etc. The vibe is not just that she\u2019s trying to surprise him, the vibe is that if he doesn\u2019t agree to the surprise blindly with no details whatsoever when he assumes he isn\u2019t going to have even a bed to sleep on (and she does nothing to correct that assumption), then in her mind he clearly doesn\u2019t love her and his punishment for not going along with her near clinically impulsive bullshit is not going on a once-in-a-lifetime trip and having no clue where on earth his mother is and getting pawned off on family members for her custody week. Christ.\n\nIf spending time with her son were important to her, she would\u2019ve (at the very least, should\u2019ve) gone about this way differently. Just saying.", "I think this is probably the part that gets me, OP is leveraging his position between dad, cousins and mom for who gives him the best offer.(which, is a total teenager move). But still probably hurts his moms feelings to have to try to convince him to see her after he\u2019s been with dad and cousins for over a month.", "It\u2019s not about getting along with his mom, he\u2019s a teenager, he wants to spend time with his peers and have fun over the summer. In my experience if hangouts with mom are generally more fun than hangouts with friends as a teenager, that kid has a shitty mom, or zero friends. \n\nHe\u2019s pulling away and establishing an independent identity. As he should, but he should balance that with still making an effort to spend quality time with his parents and let them know that they are still important to him. Even if it\u2019s normal and healthy for him to pull away, it still hurts his mother\u2019s feelings when he rejects her.", "Sometimes it's just because there's a gazillion comments and you want people to actually see yours.
