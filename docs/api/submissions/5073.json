Game changer.", "I\u2019m very interested to know the outcome of this. Please come back and update us!", "You're a great dad. It's one thing to get bullied by your peers. It's another thing entirely when the adults that are supposed to help you join in.", "Yeah as a chronically ill person occasionally you definitely need to yell at nurses. Usually to get the help of other nurses who wont do the dangerous/harmful thing.", "I still remember my mum calmly trying not to lose it on my school nurse and teacher when I was young and got heatstroke. \n\nWe had a beach day and the teacher took away my personal sunscreen to \"share with other kids\", refused to believe I needed it every 30 minutes and of course my pale, redhead,  night dwelling skin went up like a demon in church and I got so sick. Nurse didn't bother calling my mum until the end of the day. Spent 2 nights in hospital and weeks wrapped in bandages \ud83e\udd23", "There are times where it's not only understandable but also acceptable to yell at people. This is one of those rare moments.", "If your job performance involves abusing children I disagree.", "When I was in elementary school I felt nauseous and I got sent to the nurse. The nurse sent me back to class for faking it. I had never faked being sick before so we don\u2019t know where that came from. Felt even worse, got sent back to the nurse, then back to class again. When I got back to class I then puked all over another students desk and the floor. \n\nI was so delighted to tell that bitch nurse when I went back to her office that I threw up all over the classroom. When my dad came to pick me up, he reamed her and the principal out in front of me. It was beautiful.", "That health code seems to not have been written by people familiar with unpredictable menstrual cycles.", "Yeah it's a health hazard to everyone else and also to him.  It is *not healthy* to have fecal matter against your skin for hours and it can cause really nasty rashes and infection.", "This every student that sat in that seat afterwards literally say in some else's feces disgusting she needs to be fired. Then she had the audacity to tell you, you were lying and you didn't potty train a teenager", "I\u2019m gonna guess she isn\u2019t an actual nurse but an administrative assistant manning the nursing office. Most schools don\u2019t have actual nurses one to a school. They use admins to man the office and one. It\u2019s covers many multiple schools. So reporting to district is probably only recourse.", "Agreed. Sometimes kids have things wrong with them that don\u2019t fit tidy checkboxes and standard protocols. I still remember how fun it was trying to explain that I was hypoglycemic, not related to diabetes, and when I said my blood sugar was low I needed to eat something or they\u2019d be picking me off the floor, snack and lunchtimes be damned. Low blood sugar =/= hungry and the inverse is also true. And that\u2019s just a matter of taking a glucose tab. Not being denied fresh clothes because the nurse didn\u2019t believe my condition was real.", "And even if he did \"soil himself because he's lazy\" (what a stupid idea) how hard is it to give him his change of clothes?", "Which is fine. But then he should be able to go to the main office and call you. \n\nRegardless, NTA. And report the nurse.", "I hate to say it but sometimes people choose to not listen until they can hear you.  The stupidity to send a kid back to class for shitting themselves is just lazy bitter person.  Claiming you should better potty train is about the dumbest excuse I have heard for why a person can\u2019t do there job and people see it.  Did you have to fill something out for your son?  Did she choose not to look in the boys file to see if it was true.  She might work at a school because a hospital doesn\u2019t want her.", "Ignore this poster, they are being rediculous.", "I often let students go with friends since so many people are newly in the USA and most of the nurses aren\u2019t bilingual\u2014the students are superheroes who make sure their sick friends get taken care of.", "Just a side note, in our school we are not allowed to send sick kids with another student because you are then further exposing that student to the illness.", "She would have just given you an ice pack if she believed you lol", "I completely agree. Although I can't imagine a young girl wanting to sit in class with a jacket tied around her waist to avoid having a leak noticed. I'm not shaming. I'm just a person who has been called by my nieces and by some of the neighborhood girls who can't get hold of their parents, to bring up a change of clothes for them.", "Written by men, you mean?  Yeah, I'd put money on that.", "I know. That's what's so sad about this nurse. I was in the healthcare field for almost 30 yrs. I've seen how quickly a person can get a rash from soiled clothing. Doesn't seem like the school nurse likes her job, or people for that matter.", "Exactly. I highly doubt this nurse is not several raccoons in a nurse's outfit.", "So in your opinion you can't get mad at people smaller than you?  What kind of position is this.", "Sick or unwell doesn't always mean contagious, though.  I think this is a strange practice.  What if a girl is having cramps, or what if someone thinks they have broken a bone or pulled a muscle, etc?", "That is distinctly different from what they were saying.", "Ah, yes - the dangers of contagious bowel incontinence.", "It's not a matter of want but they may have to. Both of my parents worked and couldn't leave their jobs to drop a clean change of clothes if this were to happen to me. Heck, I got suspended twice and because their jobs didn't allow them to leave to pick me up, the principle let me finish the day out in in-school suspension. You were amazing for helping out like that; unfortunately, not everyone has access to someone like you.", "There must be a certified, licensed nurse in charge of health services for the district. There does not have to be a certified, licensed nurse on each campus. Prior to COVID, we hired a paraprofessional at my campus who was not a nurse. When she was out, anyone could substitute. We referred to her as \u201cNurse\u201d First Name. Starting in fall of 2020 my district does have a certified, licensed nurse on each campus. I don\u2019t know if the law changed or the powers that be just decided to make the change. I would be willing to bet that this person OP is referring to was not a licensed certified nurse, although I guess even an actual nurse could be that awful", "I don\u2019t think a raccoon would even be this cruel.", "This varies by state. In my state they must be licensed (edit to add, even substitute nurses). In our school, we have several medically complex students so when our normal nurse was unable to run they had 2 licensed nurses in the building.   However, a friend lives in a state where they did not have a licensed nurse in the building daily.", "Unless they are rabid or wants someone's leg.", "it doesn't sound like she was that scared because after he 'ripped her a new one' she doubled down on not believing the son had an actual medical condition. save your concern for someone who deserves it", "That was my take too. She doubled down and only backed off when he made mention of criminal/legal consequences. She\u2019s not afraid of him; she\u2019s afraid of the law. And she should be."]}
