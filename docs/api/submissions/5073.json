He deserves a good parent like you.", "NTA NTA NTA \n\nReport her to *EVERYONE*", "NTA. Your build is you, you can\u2019t shrink. Plus how does she compare to your son? She\u2019s an adult with power, age and authority. \n\nJust don\u2019t crowd her.", "FUCK that! You get it dad!!! Advocating for your child is never wrong and she honestly deserved to be ripped a new one. Honestly if it were me and my child (mama here) I\u2019d have probably start swinging\u2026 (mama bears will fuck shit up so be it and I\u2019m not afraid to admit I\u2019d turn to violence if I was pushed as a mom). \n\nYou did the right thing but I would also honestly report her still because she would likely do it / has done it (not believing students). She sounds like a dangerous nurse tbh. Like if a kid with ADHD needed their meds and she didn\u2019t believe them, or a kid with asma needed their inhaler (but was also overweight) and she\u2019d deny the inhaler because \u201cthey\u2019re probably too lazy and out of shape and wanted an excuse to get out of P.E/Class.\u201d She sounds dangerous. \n\nNTA, report her. Continue to be an amazing dad and advocate for your child. Great job dad.", "Medical professional here. While I always hate to see people yelling, it sounds like you tried to have a mature conversation with her and then she doubled down and refused to listen. She\u2019s lucky you didn\u2019t go after her job rather then just yell; she\u2019s horrible for not listening to your son and helping him.", "NTA. Very unprofessional for the nurse to disregard your son like that. I would be a furious parent as well", "Nurse here. NTA. In no way is it ok to have someone sit in their feces regardless if was accident or not. Any \"nurse\" would know this and her response to you when you asked was totally wrong. Not sure if this person was licensed but if she is, she needs to be educated this is wrong or not be in that position.", "One day when she is old and senile she will poopy herself and have all the time in the world to reflect on her shitty decisions. NTA.", "Nta. I agree w everyone else, you need to report her. She needs to be held accountable. Being in the medical field anything is possible.", "NTA and as a nurse, I\u2019m concerned about the fact that she made it through school laboring under the delusion that adolescent patients are never incontinent? It\u2019s nice of you to be aware that in general your voice and frame are intimidating but to be honest, she\u2019s dumb and negligent and I don\u2019t blame you for yelling.", "NTA, report her.  Report her to everyone and every organization that can be reported to.  She should not be allowed to work in schools or in the field in general if this is how she treats children who are already struggling enough.  Her career deserves to be finished.", "REPORT THIS asap! \n\nI am a nurse and support you contacting the superintendent of the school (this is an elected position so they tend to care more about parent concerns), police, and your state board licensing office.", "NTA! She deserved it and hopefully will learn from it. What a dumb ass.", "NTA. Even if what she said was true you dont leave a child in his own filth, or any person for that matter. Esp when she has the tools to get him into clean clothes. She should be fired and I don't think you took it far enough. She committed a crime and neglected hour kid. You had every right to yell at her and point out the legality of her neglectl", "NTA report her, she has no business being a nurse or working with kids", ">She said that she didn't believe someone his age could be incontinent\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow the hell is she qualified to be a nurse?", "NTA, so what if she was maybe a bit intimidated by you or about to cry? What she did may well stick with your son for life and he might never trust a nurse ever again. She messed up big time, report her to the principal and see if you can make sure she never comes back to your son's school.", "NTA\n\nReport her. Anyone who claims someone can't have a medical condition because they're the wrong age has no business being in the medical profession.", "NTA. You probably could have gotten your point across with the same words, without yell, but I think your anger was pretty justified. \n\nHowever, you really should be reporting her.", "NTA. Report to the principle, normal nursing staff, head of nursing for the district, superintendent, licensing board, and possibly even board of education.  She has no business working as a nurse at all much less with students.  I would demand an apology from her to your son.  I would also put in place a way for your son to call home if the normal nurse is out.  Further, if he has a 504, she broke a legally binding contract.\n\nI am sorry your son experienced this. I feel bad for any other students she power tripped on and humiliated/traumatized.", "INFO: l feel like you aren't telling the whole truth, or at least burying the lead. It reads like you were intentionally physically intimidating,  and that's never okay", "NTA\n\nNever wrong at all. nurses are no better than daylight robbers. they have minimal education. refuse to do any work. and scam patietns out of their hard earned money. sad", "Also, schools in my area are NOT allowed to have kids in class with any biological fluids/matter on them as it is a violation of health code! Grade pre k thru 2 are required to send a spare change of clothing for the kids \"cubby \" the first day of school in case of an accident. One of my children (in high school) got elbowed in the nose on their way to class. Even though the bleeding stopped, I had to take them clean clothes. They were not allowed to just put a hoddie on over the shirt with literally 6 spots of dried blood on it. \n\nThe nurse at the son's school failed the son in so many ways.", "You need to teach him that he can leave the school and return home if this happens in the future. Sitting in your own waste all day can cause so many issues. He needs to be able to speak up regarding his self-care needs.", "If someone had reported her disgusting behaviour earlier, perhaps your son might not have had to go through that. She might have been fired long ago.\n\nIt's not fair that it's on the victims to report the wrongs done to them, but speaking from experience,  I reported the person who did me wrong because I never wanted it to happen to anyone else ever again.\n\nThank you for standing up for your son an ensuring that she is held accountable and the people employing her know what she is capable of.\n\nJust because you're a big guy and she's a small woman doesn't mean you don't get to be angry.\n\nNTA", "Great to hear! Your sons safety and comfort come first. Do whats best for him and your family. Who knows what else this person has or hasnt done! NTA", "Good.\n\nYelling at her was not cool, and i think you know that. But also, there's literally no scenario i can think of where it's acceptable to tell a 15yo asking for his medical supplies that he will be denied the supplies and have to deal with sitting in his own waste for hours. That creates a ton of additional and unnecessary health risks.\n\nAlso, it's pretty much always abnormal for a 15yo to soil himself. Even if she didn't believe him about his medical condition, the appropriate response would be to give him his medical supplies and then notify authorities or refer for additional care.", "You\u2019re a fucking legend. Keep on being a good parent. NTA", "Good OP, don't feel sorry for people like that.", "As a nurse I implore you to report her to the board of nursing. People like her have no business being in the profession.  I'm glad your son was able to tell you what happened and I worry what she has done or will do to vulnerable people who aren't able to communicate.", "Me too. I was all ready to remind OP how terribly the hospitals are understaffed, etc but nope he is NTA.", "Same", "His changes are in the nurses office so he'd need to go in to actually get them", "You may not believe me and that's completely understandable but I can promise everyone I would never intimidate anyone on purpose. I wasn't yelling to intimidate or make her feel small in comparison, I was yelling because she could've easily given my son an infection or worse. I was angry, but I wasn't aggressive physically.", "That reminds the nurse on my old school. Everytime someone took a friend that was sick and tell what they had, she would say \"Did they lost the ability to talk too? You have no business here, they can say what is wrong with them\" and she did this with EVERYONE, even when the teachers send the friend to make company.", "As a parent, I'd react 100% the same as you if this were my son or daughter. The part that gets me is her doubling down on there not being an issue with your son and then having the audacity to put the blame on you saying you should've toilet trained your son better! Nope. As soon as I read that, I felt my blood boil, so I get it. It's always easier to look back on these kinds of incidents with a bit of clarity and reconsider our words or actions, but godamnit, so many things that this nurse did lead you to yelling at her, so I firmly 100% believe that you sir are NTA. \n\nAnd I'm glad you're taking steps to ensure this doesn't happen at that school again.", "As a woman, I really appreciate you for being aware that your size might be intimidating.\n\n\n\"She said that she didn't believe someone his age could be incontinent and I was lying because I refused to potty train him\"\n\nAs a non-intimidating sized woman who doesn't even have children, I absolutely understand why you reacted the way you did, I too would have snapped if a school nurse would have said something like that to me.\nAnd medical problem or not, what kind of monster does that to a child??!!\n\nHard NTA.", "And the desire to be PapaBear is understandable.  But the fact that you felt the need to explain your physical stature and hers suggests that you know good and well that you were physically intimidating", "That is so wrong. One time I felt sick in chemistry class and my teacher was a gem. Near the end of class I felt incredible pain and nausea and I just walked forward to say \"I'm going to the nurse\" because I couldn't bear it. He looks at me and mildly yells \"Ginger go with her!\" Next thing I knew he was picking me up off the floor. He was right, I needed help getting to the nurse.", "What state? It is illegal in my state to call yourself a nurse if you're not licensed. Even the substitutes must have a nursing license", "Why did people downvote here you were just explaining what E S H means", "I feel like he explained his physical difference because it was in better context to why he might feel like an AH\u2026 I doubt anyone would honestly think a parent was an AH for advocating for their child in this situation (well I hope no one would) but OP felt the guilt not really just for yelling but for yelling and his size on top of it since she looked ready to cry and was significantly smaller than him.", "They might be an STNA or an off duty EMT/paramedic. No school district would likely be able to afford the going rate for a RN/BSN. As for being called a nurse, it happens a lot. Patients in hospitals often confuse the two levels (why many of the bigger, major hospitals color code the positions), and it often occurs in doctor office. The person who weighs you, gives shots, does blood pressure is rarely a nurse but most people still say the nurse did it.", "I disagree,  based on language like \"ripped her a new one,\" etc.  His retelling to me reads extremely aggressive. And while I'll never fault a parent for being protective of their kid, this one has icky vibes for me."]}
