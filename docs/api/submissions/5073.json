That woman should not be trusted to administer care to anyone, let alone children.", "School teacher here,, and you are NTA. The intimidation and humiliation she may have felt was just a tiny FRACTION of what your son went through over the course of that school day. Normally I always start with \u201ctalk to the teacher and get his/her side before you get upset\u201d, but you did that! And her reasoning was inexcusable and ignorant! Your next step should be to make an appointment to meet with principal and regular nurse.

I guarantee you however bad she felt about muscular 6 foot 4 you telling at her is nothing compared to how she made your son feel. How scared and embarrassed he must have been. She deserved every bit of your anger, good on you for standing up for your son. I'd still report her though. That kind of person is either dangerously negligent or completely lacking in empathy and her superiors should know that they've put someone like that in charge of children.", "I'm sorry for leaving this bit of information out!

Even if it's not enough to lose her license, certainly the school district should want to keep her away from vulnerable children. \n\nYou've correctly identified that as a large man, you may have greater social expectations towards not making others feel unsafe.

That is beyond incompetent and I'm shocked that any teacher didn't intervene before the end of the school day.

That was a horrid way to treat him. I would go to the nursing board and get her licence yanked. That is child abuse. What is wrong with her. I am no nurse but by god I would not let anyone sit in their own feces. I hope that school gives your family a stunning apology.", "NTA. please report her. No more children deserve to go through this. She also accused you of being a bad parent..", "Your son might be eligible to use a sacral neuromodular (interstim) for his bowl incontinence.
