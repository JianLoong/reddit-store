You accidentally bought incompatible chillies, he forgot to wash his hands before scratching himself. Hopefully lessons are learned and he doesn't do that again.", "This maybe the funniest post I\u2019ve seen all day.  NTA. You\u2019re laughing, he\u2019s laughing (and in pain) we\u2019re all laughing\u2026", "NTA it's common sense to wash your hands after touching chilies", "You both laughed afterward.  There is no conflict here.", "NTA. I'm dying here.", "NTA. Your husband is ridiculous to complain about this when you didn't have another option. Next time tell him to wash his hands between prep cook work and touching his balls. Not sure I'd be sharing meals with him...", "NTA\n\nI hope his reaction is just something he said out of pain and not the way he normally treats you. I've gotten pepper on my balls before, and it's fo-sho' enough to make one cuss. But I also knew it was funny and laughed at myself through the tears.", "NTA. Sorry rule 1 when touching hot peppers, always wash your hands THROUGHLY before touching any body part. I would have giggled too.", "INFO:. Giggling with him, or giggling at him?  And playful banter or actual angry name calling?  I don't know your relationship or shared sense of humor (or not) so can't judge.\n\nIf you want to be nice, bring him a bowl of milk or yogurt he can soak his balls in.  Water alone won't wash away the oils.  Also, maybe don't get frisky tonight even if his hands and balls don't feel hot anymore.  Pepper oils on the sensitive bits can ruin the fun real quick, and then he'll be the one giggling while you call him names.", "NTA. This is a series of unfortunate events. Was it an asshole move to laugh at his pain, kinda. But not enough to deem you the asshole overall. He'll probably laugh about it too soon enough.", "NTA also tell him to try washing his balls with an oil based cleanser (or just straight up olive oil) then soap if needed. Water won't actually wash off what's causing the pain because it's oil based so you need something oil based to cleanse it. But the cold does help it feel better.", "NTA for getting the \"wrong\" peppers. A very soft YTA for laughing. \n\nFrankly, I would've laughed too. One time my idiot of an ex husband decided to do smores inside over a gas stove. He used a fork for the marshmallows. In all his *brilliance* he decided to stick the HOT marshmallow, fork included, in his mouth.... I heard the fork sizzle his lips from across the room. I laughed so hard. He had fork burns on his lips forever. I still laugh to this day. Yes, I'm a jerk but it was oh so funny.", "NTA. I'd be concerned that he 'called you all kinds of names' more than anything. That makes him the asshole. You bought chilis and he should know that regardless of spice he should wash his hands after handling peppers.", "Lol, NTA. He was the dumb guy who scratched his balls with his chili covered hands. He\u2019ll probably never make that mistake again.", "NTA Hopefully he will laugh about it later. Thai chilies are pretty spicy, we use them in our food a lot because we love very spicy things. My husband and I have paid the price of touching an eye or other sensitive part with Thai chili hands many times before. We almost always laugh at each other after asking if we can help the one suffering first.", "NAH just a guy who's put out act pouting.

I told him about doing it outside, they're really hot peppers, etc.\n\nWhen I got home, he had just started the blender, and was on the deck (not way out in the yard).  I was about to call out (and say bad words, because the hot pepper smell would probably drift into the house).\n\nAnd then I saw him, the guy who loves to cook, open the blender full of ground hot chili peppers, lean in and take a long sniff.  I've never seen a face scrunch up so quickly.\n\nHe was rinsing his eyes.  He was gagging, blowing his nose, taking sips of milk. It took a couple hours before he could sit down and try to breathe normally.\n\nThe house had a faint taint of hot peppers for a few days, making our eyes tear and blink a lot.\n\nWe don't talk of that day often, except to mention that \"those peppers were really hot\".", "Tell him to wash his balls with soap and water not just rinse.
