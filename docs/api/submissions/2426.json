My husband likes to cook and will sometimes request certain things so he can make a special meal he wants.  \n\nHe wanted to make Thai chili lime shrimp. He asked me to pick up the hot chilies like you get at a Thai restaurant.  The grocery store didn't have any of those little ones but they did have the ones labeled as hot Thai chilies that were bright red but about the size of a jalapeno. \n\nHe got really upset that I hadn't bought the right ones and that his meal wasn't going to turn out well.  I know he had a tough day so I said I would make sure I got the proper ones the next time I saw them. It was just a silly disagreement with no bitterness or anything. Just a little disappointment on his part.  \n\nHe still made the meal.  Including chopping up the chilies.  \n\nAfter he was done prepping he needed to use the bathroom.  And he scratched his balls.  \n\nWell let me tell you. The peppers had plenty of heat to them after all.  He is sitting on the edge of the tub with the hand held shower blasting cold water at his scrotum.  And every time he tries to stop he has to sit right back down and shoot more cold water at them. \n\nSo I giggled. And he heard me.

You accidentally bought incompatible chillies, he forgot to wash his hands before scratching himself. Hopefully lessons are learned and he doesn't do that again.", "This maybe the funniest post I\u2019ve seen all day.  NTA. You\u2019re laughing, he\u2019s laughing (and in pain) we\u2019re all laughing\u2026", "NTA it's common sense to wash your hands after touching chilies", "You both laughed afterward.  There is no conflict here.", "NTA. I'm dying here.", "NTA. Your husband is ridiculous to complain about this when you didn't have another option. Next time tell him to wash his hands between prep cook work and touching his balls. Not sure I'd be sharing meals with him...", "NTA\n\nI hope his reaction is just something he said out of pain and not the way he normally treats you. I've gotten pepper on my balls before, and it's fo-sho' enough to make one cuss. But I also knew it was funny and laughed at myself through the tears.", "NTA. Sorry rule 1 when touching hot peppers, always wash your hands THROUGHLY before touching any body part. I would have giggled too.", "INFO:. Giggling with him, or giggling at him?  And playful banter or actual angry name calling?  I don't know your relationship or shared sense of humor (or not) so can't judge.\n\nIf you want to be nice, bring him a bowl of milk or yogurt he can soak his balls in.  Water alone won't wash away the oils.  Also, maybe don't get frisky tonight even if his hands and balls don't feel hot anymore.  Pepper oils on the sensitive bits can ruin the fun real quick, and then he'll be the one giggling while you call him names.", "NTA. This is a series of unfortunate events. Was it an asshole move to laugh at his pain, kinda. But not enough to deem you the asshole overall. He'll probably laugh about it too soon enough.", "NTA also tell him to try washing his balls with an oil based cleanser (or just straight up olive oil) then soap if needed. Water won't actually wash off what's causing the pain because it's oil based so you need something oil based to cleanse it. But the cold does help it feel better.", "NTA for getting the \"wrong\" peppers. A very soft YTA for laughing. \n\nFrankly, I would've laughed too. One time my idiot of an ex husband decided to do smores inside over a gas stove. He used a fork for the marshmallows. In all his *brilliance* he decided to stick the HOT marshmallow, fork included, in his mouth.... I heard the fork sizzle his lips from across the room. I laughed so hard. He had fork burns on his lips forever. I still laugh to this day. Yes, I'm a jerk but it was oh so funny.", "NTA. I'd be concerned that he 'called you all kinds of names' more than anything. That makes him the asshole. You bought chilis and he should know that regardless of spice he should wash his hands after handling peppers.", "Lol, NTA. He was the dumb guy who scratched his balls with his chili covered hands. He\u2019ll probably never make that mistake again.", "NTA Hopefully he will laugh about it later. Thai chilies are pretty spicy, we use them in our food a lot because we love very spicy things. My husband and I have paid the price of touching an eye or other sensitive part with Thai chili hands many times before. We almost always laugh at each other after asking if we can help the one suffering first.", "NAH just a guy who's put out act pouting. We all do it from time to time.\n\nIf he doesn't cool down, NTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

NAH in the absence of a justified asshole award.", "NTA. He didn't have to still use them.", "NTA, because I think he learned that some peppers are spicy enough to do the job, despite the size.", "I agree with your husband, I\u2019d have called you an asshole too.\n\nNTA though.\n\nThanks for the laugh OP", "Lol oh I remember the pain of taking a contact lens out without thinking after cutting up some jalape\u00f1os.\n\nNAH.", "Lol nta.....but i understand that peppers are hot and the damage it does reminds me when my niece bit into a scotch bonnet pepper and i had to drive around looking for lemon and milk ...got home and this little kid is walking and playing around like her mouth wasn't on fire. Nope she said it was crunchy lol (checked the pepper and her teeth marks were clear and present lol)", "HE TOUCHED HIS BALLS WHEN COOKING. HOW OFTEN DOES THAT HAPPEN DURING FOOD PREPARATION! My brain is weeping. Do not eat the Scrotum-Touched shrimp!", "NTA.  It *was* funny.  If his knickers get into such a twist about buying ingredients, then he can buy his own.\n\nI love Thai food and jalapeno peppers, so I have also suffered from that sting on my face etc.  I am F56.  Don't feel bad - he needs to get over himself.'\n\nEDIT: Does he call you names often?  That seems disturbing to me.", "Or wear gloves while working on them. Anything to avoid touching, well, sensitive areas :D", "He's still in there cursing me out.", "He's not serious.

The name calling and shrieking is more coming out between pained laughter.", "Soap should also help, or baking soda.", "Ar you serious about the yogurt?", "Well he's in there now with sour cream covered balls waiting for revenge.", "No. He was done prep and needed to go to the bathroom. He rinsed off his hands and he would have washed them after using the washroom.", "Yes. Totally serious. Dairy will help remove the chili oil. Cold water or ice won\u2019t remove the oil.", "Yes!  The fats in the dairy help dissolve the capsaicin oils that are causing the burning feeling.", "NTA I was already giggling while reading your story but now I'm outright cracking up. I can totally picture a sad pouty somewhat angry man with sour cream covered balls sitting in the tub and it is a glorious mental picture to have.", "That might be the best sentence I've ever read.", "Run away!!! Home Alone style. Put some traps between the bathroom door and yourself xD. \n\nBut I agree with someone else's advice. Even if the burning goes away, avoid getting frisky for a day at least... you definitely don't want to be the one in the bathroom slathered in sour cream lol.", "Okay. I didn't have yogurt but he is slathering on sour cream. And giving me very dirty looks. I think he is coming after me when he is not on pain."]}
