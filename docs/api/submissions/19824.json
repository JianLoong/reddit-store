Your soon to be ex husband is a royal asshole for not supporting your son and for using your daughter as a pawn in the divorce. \n\nYou are an asshole for grounding your very emotionally distressed daughter and further alienating her when she needs your support the most. \n\nYou and your soon to be ex husband are both assholes for lying to your children for years about such a critical part of your lives as having previous marriages is. You don't need to tell them the intimate details about your infidelity to your exes, but pretending you were never married and making up a story about you met is equally unnecessary and emotionally unhealthy. \n\nYou are both terrible parents. Those poor children.", "YTA and so is your husband, in so many ways. \n\nShe called you a liar.... for lying to her her whole life. You did lie to her. You are a liar. \n\nNot only that, you frame your divorce as something that your kids have to pick sides in. And you say shit like \"I can't stop her from seeing him\".... wtf would you want to? He's her dad.", "YTA. (As is your ex.) Okay the kid was out of line calling your a b\\*tch. But there is so much more going on here:\n\n1. She has just had her whole world turned upside down and you and your soon to be ex are putting her squarely in the middle of a divorce that is in no way her fault or responsivity. You can let her know that her calling you the b word  was  totally unacceptable.  Mor importantly given the circumstances cutting her a little slack would be the compassionate thing to do. Grounding her and taking her phone were not compassionate. They were angry responses.\n2. You're anger at her is not really about the b word. It's about her being manipulated by her father....and since you can't hit back at him, you're hitting back at her for her perceived disloyalty.\n3. You are angry because calling you a liar was a bit too close to the truth. You did lie about some things. So did her dad. You say that what her dad said about you was \"obviously\" a lie. But from where I sit I see no reason for her to reject what he said out of hand. You have lied on related matters before, why not about this?\n4. You seem to want to have custody of of her. Okay, but why? It sounds more like you're fighting over the marriage \"property\" than a human being. Nowhere in this do you show any loving or even liking for your daughter. You are so focused on your fight with the dad, that everything else has been made subservient to it.\n\nFrankly as your lawyer told you at her age the courts are going to put a heavy weight on what SHE wants in terms of custody--regardless of how thorough your case for parental alienation on her father's part is.

Just accept your part in the affair.", "YTA -  there are three things you cannot hide: the sun, the moon, and the truth.  the fact that you grounded her, especially when YOU are one of the major factors (along with your soon to be ex) causing her to act out, makes you double TA.  apologize, accept the anger from your daughter, or be prepared to lose her.", "ESH except the children.

Gross.)", "YTA - Your children were always going to find out the truth one way or another.

Divorces suck, and you definitely lied to your daughter. Also your ex is trying to turn her against you. And she\u2019s a 17 year old, not exactly a fully grown adult in master of her emotions. Sure she lashed out, but the solution would have been to let it slide. Talk to her, explain why you didn\u2019t feel like bringing up your previous wedding, talk about your reasons for ending this wedding (which are super valid btw, good on you for looking out for your son). \n\nBut in this difficult time for your daughter, and with your ex trying to turn her against you, it\u2019s very important that you don\u2019t alienate her, and instead be a good parent and help her through it.", "YTA and so is your husband.\n\n> Neither him or I had kids with our ex's, so we just throw away our weddings photos and pretended neither of those marriages happened\n\nThat is such a childish way to go about your lives, it's almost funny.", "ESH\n\nYou and your ex husband both suck for lying to your children and allowing your kids to be put in the middle of what is clearly an ugly divorce", "ESH I feel so sorry for your kids for having such terrible, vindictive, lying parents.", "YTA.

Crazy concept, isn\u2019t it?\n\nYour daughter\u2019s entire life has been turned upside down and you\u2019re punishing her for being upset about it. \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, though, your stbex isn\u2019t any better in this scenario. \n\nESH, and by everyone I mean you and your stbex. Your children are innocent in this. Don\u2019t punish them for having emotions", ">although all I'm doing is supporting my son\n\nWell that's the Sarlacc pit of plot holes. What is it you need to support your son over that makes her angry enough to hate you?\n\n\nYta for grounding your daughter the way you did, give her consequences for swearing at you certainly but try not to make a habit of essentially teaching her truth telling is punishable.

She is obviously not happy that you and her dad are splitting up.  \n\nYou need to talk to her more and not push her away.  If you do not comfort her, she will find comfort in someone else.
