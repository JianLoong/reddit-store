He's her dad.", "YTA. (As is your ex.) Okay the kid was out of line calling your a b\\*tch. But there is so much more going on here:\n\n1. She has just had her whole world turned upside down and you and your soon to be ex are putting her squarely in the middle of a divorce that is in no way her fault or responsivity. You can let her know that her calling you the b word  was  totally unacceptable.  Mor importantly given the circumstances cutting her a little slack would be the compassionate thing to do. Grounding her and taking her phone were not compassionate. They were angry responses.\n2. You're anger at her is not really about the b word. It's about her being manipulated by her father....and since you can't hit back at him, you're hitting back at her for her perceived disloyalty.\n3. You are angry because calling you a liar was a bit too close to the truth. You did lie about some things. So did her dad. You say that what her dad said about you was \"obviously\" a lie. But from where I sit I see no reason for her to reject what he said out of hand. You have lied on related matters before, why not about this?\n4. You seem to want to have custody of of her. Okay, but why? It sounds more like you're fighting over the marriage \"property\" than a human being. Nowhere in this do you show any loving or even liking for your daughter. You are so focused on your fight with the dad, that everything else has been made subservient to it.\n\nFrankly as your lawyer told you at her age the courts are going to put a heavy weight on what SHE wants in terms of custody--regardless of how thorough your case for parental alienation on her father's part is.

If your ex is in fact trying to drive a wedge between you and your daughter, you just played right into his hands. Stop treating her like a child.", "YTA - you lied for their entire life and are upset you got called out? Bet she goes no contact now", "ESH, but honestly you are probably going to be better off letting your oldest stay with your ex. Write out the whole truth in a letter, give it to her and keep a copy for the future, and let her go. You have two younger kids you should focus on and if you ex is just working on twisting her opinion, she's old enough that you aren't going to be able to fight for custody long anyway.", "This might be the most ESH post I\u2019ve ever read", "ESH. I\u2019m putting as that because I think it\u2019s ridiculous of your daughter to only blame you for cheating on your spouse. You both cheated, so I do think her anger only being directed at you is unfair.", "YTA\n\nRegardless of why, you both lied to your kids. So her calling you a liar is valid. That bit aside, I would talk to her about being careful regarding bigoted thoughts/actions.", "YTA. If you don't want to be called a liar, don't lie.", "Ynta BUT your daughter is old enuff to hear the truth. You and your husband should have told her together. OR NOT. Your relationship is none of her business. Grounding her is correct she needs to learn boundaries. You did not lie to her you just didn\u2019t tell her about something that\u2019s none of her business", "YTA losing your temper isn\u2019t as excuse and you probably don\u2019t remember all the times you have but your kids sure will. your child is being used as a pawn and your instinct is to punish her for it. I understand protecting your son but your not in a triage situation and all of your kids could use some clarification and understanding. \nDo you think just maybe she may question her paternity and that\u2019s why she\u2019s so angry at you? You had an affair and got pregnant before you were divorced, that timeline may cause her to ask some, very valid, questions and it may be coming from your ex but your best bet is to tell the whole story. not your side or what makes you look good but the whole truth no matter how shitty you both may seem in it.", "ESH my aunt and uncle did this to their children and it was so cringe when *everyone* but their kids knew. It was going to come out eventually. That being said it\u2019s the right move to support your son and divorce this guy. It\u2019s wrong of him to manipulate your daughter, but you shouldn\u2019t be grounding her for struggling through a hard situation and not knowing if she can trust either of her parents.", "So just to get this straight, you and your (ex)husband lied to your children their entire lives. And your daughter is trying to process the divorce, and she would like to know the truth about your history. She called you out on *your* lies, and you retaliated by taking her phone and grounding her? And you still aren't quite sure if YTA or not?\n\n\nYTA and so is your ex. You both need to do better for your children. Also, don't act surprised when your daughter chooses to live with her father instead of you.", "ESH", "I'm going with ESH.\n\nTaking this at face value, instead of trying to infer from missing info, I see the following:\n\nYou suck for not being open with your kids over how you two got together. And for punishing your daughter for her emotions. They were over the top, but still. Not a good look.\n\nYour STBEx sucks for also not telling the truth to your kids, and potentially compounding this by adding onto the lie. He also sucks for being a potential transphobe. Bigotry is not a good look.\n\nYour daughter sucks(the least) for not listening, and for her over the top outburst. If she starts acting like daddy towards her sibling, then she starts to suck even more.\n\nThe one coming out trans and the littlest are the only ones who don't suck in this stinking and steaming pile.", "YTA, you lied to your daughter then grounded her when she found out the truth?", "\n\n>she told me she never wants to see me again and such. I got sick of that and grounded her, I took her phone and sent her to her room.\n\nop, what, exactly, do you imagine grounding her in this situation is going to accomplish? if you're goal is to push her farther into camp dad, you're certainly doing a good job of it. the situation is a cluster fuck, there's no way around it, but reacting with aggression right now is not going to help you. you either need to be understanding of your daughter right now, or accept what her choice is going to be. those are really your only two options in this shit show.", "To me this makes 0 sense.\nYou both cheated didn't you? Then you got together, got married, had children and lived your lives?\nAm I reading this wrong??", "YTA\n\nYou grounded her for having very legitimate feelings about learning the truth you've kept hidden from her. You could have sat her down and listened to her and supported her but you went to punishment.\n\nYou are doing the alienating here that you were trying to avoid.", "YTA. I really don't think this is simply about your son. What did you do?", "NTA- i can barely imagine going through a divorce for trying to protect my child from their father, then having a different child attack me because of manipulations from...their father. Absolutely devastating, so I understand why you snapped and went to grounding. As you have already discovered, though, your response was not helpful in trying to calm the situation. I hope you can figure out a way to talk to your daughter WITHOUT blaming your soon to be ex(as much as he deserves it). She'll find out the truth eventually, kids always do, and you need to stay as truthful and neutral as possible. Good luck...", "ESH\n\nTherapy seems like it'll be much more helpful to your daughter than grounding her for being upset at new facts. I'd get on that before you lose her.\n\nYour soon to be ex sucks for playing games with the daughter to hurt you", "They\u2019re divorcing because the son is trans and the dad is a bigot. Wanting to keep your kid away from a transphobe is understandable. \n\nAnd this is very much a pick sides divorce. It has to be, because their splitting up over dad\u2019s bigotry toward his kid. Daughter is a bigot for choosing her father in this situation.", "Seriously, she's not mad at being called a bitch but a liar, which she IS. You can't ground your kid for being honest.", "Right it's crazy to me that when something like this happens the parents first response is to take away electronics and send them to their room. Yes, that response is totally going to get them to understand, come around, and want them to be around you. HAHA NO, it's going to produce the complete opposite.", "The ex is a transphobic asshole trying to pit his kids against each other, I'd at the very *least* vote this one an ESH", "My mom told me growing up that they met in highschool, but learned as an adult they hooked up the first time they met at a party. It doesn\u2019t matter.", "It just doesn't come out in conversations that often, they asked a couple times when they were younger, that's it. I told Amelie this, I told her that it's a lie that he wanted to tell them and I didn't, he wanted to \"hide\" it as much as I did.", "For real.  It messed up both sides are getting the kids involved and trying to weaponize them against each other.  Both parents are AH.", "I told her all of that, she was still calling me names, so I lost my temper", "If both she and her husband are AHs then the appropriate judgement is ESH (Everyone Sucks Here), not Y-T-A.", "Kind of hard to avoid that though, given that they\u2019re divorcing BECAUSE of the kids. Son is trans, dad refuses to accept him, mom does. No real way to not have the kids - or, at least, the kid - in the middle in that situation.", "Sorry, I tried to make the post short. \n\nThe reason we're getting divorced is because our son came out as trans (he was born as a girl, he very recently came out as a guy. Please excuse me if I make any mistakes, he's helping me but sometimes I do get confused). My husband got very angry, he said he won't accept it, while I'm supporting my son, now he's trying to get Amelie against her brother and me", "How is her husband not just as much of a liar and a cheat as she is, though? This is as clear a case of ESH as there's ever been on this sub.", "Our son came out as trans, my ex isn't supporting him, he called our son a lot of names so I obviously got very angry and that's why I'm supporting my son and why we're getting divorced. He's trying to get Amelie against her brother.", "The divorce is about the eldest son being trans, Dad is a bigot and OP is supportive. But it's not exactly relevant to being called a liar by the daughter.", "His side of the story is that his daughter is \"sick\", she has a mental illness because trans people are just people with mental health issues, that's all he said to my son", "He told her I didn't allow him to tell the truth because I'm controlling, he's trying to pain himself as such a victim", "wouldn't be surprised if he left that out or twist it saying I was happily married but your mother seduced me, baby-trapped me and blackmailed me into being with her.", "Yeah, I'm trying to figure it out with my lawyer, he knows he won't get custody over our youngest, he doesn't want to fight for custody over our middle son, so the only one he has left is Amelie, he's playing with her", "It is not reasonable to expect someone who was raised by a bigot (dad didn't just magically turn transphobe overnight) to cut all ties with their own parent instead of taking the time to process everything on their own time, on their own terms. It wouldn't even be reasonable for the trans son. They'll go through that process on their own, it's your job as a parent to support them through it, not force them. \n\nThe sides are the son, and the dad. As far as we know, neither of them are demanding to pick sides. The couple splitting up doesn't constitute the sides.\n\nMom is making it about her. If daughter is mad at mom for lying to her her whole life, how is that going against her brother? That has nothing to do with the son being trans. That's \"Moms side vs dad's side\", which is completely unhealthy thing to push onto kids in a divorce.", "Youre their parent - \u201cit doesnt come up in conversation that often\u201d doesnt fly. \n\nYou should be initiating conversations about important topics.", "The better option instead of deny, deny, deny or push blame onto your husband was to apologize and explain the truth. It sounds like you went straight to your father is lying we both wanted to sweep this under the rug. Instead be a grown up and apologize for lying like you would have expected your daughter to do to you if she was lying about something. \"Look I'm sorry for lying to you about how we became a family, but at the time your father and I thought it best. X,Y,Z happened and yeah it probably didn't paint us in the best light and that did factor into our decision. I'm sorry we kept that from you.\"  \n\nHow exactly is grounding her for callling you out helping the situation? I mean you basically helped villianized yourself at that point.", "It doesn't matter. You lost the game. He got to her and told her the truth before you did. That's what happens when you lie. This is why you should've told her a long time ago. Preferably together.", "You're the parent. You can't use the \"I lost my temper\" excuse when your child calls you names BECAUSE SHE'S EXTREMELY DISTRESSED AFTER LEARNING HOW YOU LIED TO HER HER ENTIRE LIFE ABOUT WHO YOU ARE AND YOUR CHARACTER, AND LEARNING IT THROUGH THE WORDS OF SOMEONE WHO PURPOSELY MANIPULATED HER EMOTIONS AGAINST YOU. \n\nHonestly. You as horrible a parent as your ex. None of you gives a fig about Amelie. He only cares to make her hate you. You only care for her not to think you're a bad person and to punish her for calling you names.", "The conflict resolves around grounding the daughter. daughter is in no way an AH", "So what exactly has Amelie done to your son? Cause your post implies that her issue with you is that you lied about your previous marriage.", "Farmers must have moved some bulls into a field near me. Odd.", "I did not see the edit when I had commented as that hadn\u2019t been added yet. I answered forgetting ESH was an option, but at the same time OP is acting like they\u2019re some sort of victim in all of this so I wanted to make it clear they are TA but obviously husband is too esp after reading that update. Changing verdict now.", "That's got to be very hard. I hope the kids can all end up happier. I've got no vote, this is above my pay grade with the added information, just best wishes to all for things to be better.", "And what your daughter thinks about her brother? She seems fine with her father telling those things?", "Ummm....you are a liar. \n\n\nYou are both liars, of course. And cheaters. And he was 30 and you were 23 when you had a kid. \n\n\nWhy won't he get custody of your youngest? \n\n\nAnd it seems like Amelie wants to go with him, but you are treating kids like prizes to be won.", "Here we are adult at 18 and at 16 you can already decide if you want to live with a parent or another.\n\nIf you managed to have any kind of bond with your daughter, you guys will come around. Don't put oil on that fire by forcing her to stay with you.", "Plus OP's edit just... convenient oh what a hero OP is for protecting her trans child. \ud83d\udc4f \n\nSomething is missing in this story.\n\nYTA for being a liar and then grounding ur kid for saying the truth. Way to confuse her.", "The truth that...he also cheated on his wife? Idk. Im not convinced he actually told the 'truth' when both parents cheated on their spouses, it is deranged to only blame one.", "Daughter is siding with her transphobic dad, so\u2026 ESH.", "Yep, sounds like the suddenly appearing son in this story is nothing but a smokescreen to hide the fact that OP is an asshole", "Yes, we're both liars and cheaters, but he's trying to get Amelie to think that I am the bad guy somehow? When he did exactly the same? \n\nHe's young, my lawyer told me that most likely I will get custody over him, I also have proof that he's not a good father.. however Amelie is old enough to ask to live with her dad, that's what my lawyer explained. He's manipulating her, I just don't want her to take as much time as I did to find out he's an ass.", "Not disagreeing, however let\u2019s also keep in mind that transphobic dad is clearly manipulative. \n\nRegardless, this is why family secrets don\u2019t stay hidden for long and usually blow up in people\u2019s faces. I feel for all the kids, but especially the youngest and the one transitioning.", "Well if you keep losing your temper and grounding her for being rightfully upset after a very long time of lies, you can guarantee she'll cut you out of her life.", "He doesn\u2019t have to alienate her. By loosing your temper over being confronted with the truth, grounding her and taking her phone away; yea, that will help her make a decision. \n\nYou know you have a choice. To be the good parent to all your kids. To commit you did lie. Tell her why you did it, without it being blamed on someone else. Just admit the mistake. \n\nTill then ESH. Yes, teenagers can use their mouth in a way you don\u2019t like. But someone that just found out she has been lied to, knows her parents are divorcing and had a brother in trans; that\u2019s a whole lot of stuff on her plate.", "Seem like most of reddit wants to call you the ass for your past actions instead of the current one you were asking about. Sorry for the mob/pitchfork mentality you are getting."]}
