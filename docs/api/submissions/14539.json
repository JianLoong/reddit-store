I also have a 16yo daughter.\n\nMy late husband left me everything and told me to trust his lawyer. My husband had worked for 20 years as a doctor and did some minor investing so I inherited over 7 figures.\n\nA year later, I decided to list our home of 12 years and received an offer too good to refuse. With the inheritance as well as the influx of cash from selling the house, I decided to move my daughter and I to Malibu because we always dreamed of a home next to the beach but my husband was exceptionally tight fisted and called homes there money pits.\n\nWe found a beautiful home by the sea. I never personally handled anything regarding buying a home before so I did not anticipate all the extra costs beyond the sticker price. \n\nBut my daughter was so excited so I decided to go for it. My late husband's lawyer was furious at my decision so I decided stopped taking his calls. I ended up signing with a money manager who said that we'd be passively earning 90 percent of what surgeons earned per year.\n\nBut the money manager ended up tanking a lot of our investments. I took the dwindling money out and made my own investments which made it worse and long story short, because of all that I only have around $35k available to me now., not to mention our debts.\n\nWith the amount available to me, I am looking at only being able to pay 1 month of a mortgage/ upkeep and then I'm basically out of luck until my business gets clients. However, the place where we do have a significant amount of money is the fund my husband started for our daughter. With the money there, I could prevent our credit cards from being shut down, and not have to worry about the mortgage for many more months. \n\nSo I ended up liquidating my daughter's college fund. I told her about it today and she was furious and said she cannot believe all her dad's work is gone. Shea slo said she won't be supporting me for retirement. AITA for trying to fix my mistakes and trying to keep our house?", "created_utc": 1681226288, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12in3fl/aita_for_liquidating_my_daughters_college_fund_to/", "score": 1151, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That money is not yours. You should be ashamed of yourself.", "YTA and also fabulously incompetent with money. You will not keep the dream house: you lack ability to earn enough money or to manage what you have.

Now you learned and are asking for his advice on how to fix things.", "YTA.\n\nYou made an extremely poor financial decision and disregarded those around you who were offering you more sound financial advice. Having a home near the beach doesn't mean you need to move to Malibu but I digress. \n\nYou are absolutely the AH here.

No offense but\n\n> who said that we'd be passively earning 90 percent of what surgeons earned per year.\n\nReally? Comon. You believed that? Oh look, next line is its a scam. I didn't even read that far. Your the Asshole for making these moves without advising her given you clearly are horrible with money.", "It wasn't enough to screw up your own life, so you had to f\\*ck up your daughter's as well? Wow.\n\nYTA.", "Hopefully the daughter gets a hold of dad's lawyer and works to sue you.", "You are kidding right? Easily YTA.\nYou flushed down the drain in a matter of no time 7 figure savings of all what your husband worked hard for. You stopped picking up on your husbands lawyer calls cause you were too arrogant to listen to his advice despite your late husband explicitly telling you to. And to make things worse you stole money that doesn\u2019t belong to you, that college fund belonged to your daughter and you had no morally acceptable reason to liquidate it and not even tell her prior to that.", "YTA\n\nOh my god\u2026you ruined your entire financial future for a vanity house and used your teenage daughter\u2019s excitement instead of your lawyer\u2019s advice as assurance of this decision.\n\nSo basically you have a house you can\u2019t afford. Your daughter\u2019s college education is now unaffordable. You have no additional assets nor investments to your name. I\u2019d be on the lookout for your daughter exploring emancipation because of your financial illiteracy.", "YTA - you could have sold the house, it's obvious that you can't afford it. But a small house and ensure your daughter has a future.", "YTA - I'm sure your husband is rolling in his grave about how much you have royally messed up. And then you go and mess with your daughters education fund?", "YTA. Your poor money management is your fault, not your daughters. That money was for her. You liquidated it to keep some beach house??? She's is 16, and she would have gotten over not having a beach house. The blame is squarely on your shoulders. Those were your mistakes. Shame on you.", "YTA big time and will probably never make up for all the money you lost", "YTA. You made poor financial decisions and instead of educating yourself you chose to take away the savings your late husband left for your daughter. Just because you made bad decisions doesn't mean your daughter's future needs to suffer as well. I'm truly not even sure how you managed to go from millions to 35k even with having read your story. I hope you find someone who will teach you how to not be so reckless with money. Your husband would be turning in his grave if he knew you liquidated the entire account.", "YTA - its honestly sad how you effectively negated all the hard work and solid financial decisions made by your late spouse in such a short period of time. It seems like you made up your mind to make an impulsive bad decision then when met with logic - opted to 'cover your eyes/ears' until you found someone who told you what you wanted to hear.\n\nHaving to dig into your child's college fund as a result of your poor decision making might be necessary at this point to stay afloat, but it doesnt stop you from being in the wrong and an AH.

I bet that's just what your husband would want.", "YTA. \n\nSounds like your husband had the only financial sense of the family and did his best not only provide for both you and your daughter but to also mitigate your financial ignorance by having his lawyer look after you but you messed that up, too. \n\nSell the beach house, MalibuBarbie, and put the money back in your daughter\u2019s college account.

YTA. Your daughter is right to never speak to you again. \n\nIt's not \"our\" house - it is YOUR house and if you had a shred of sense you would sell that place immediately. Are you underwater on it? I'd bet that you bought at the peak, and the market has cooled now. Take the L, put your daughter's money back, and buy a condo somewhere while your \"business\" (Plexus? Leggings?) takes off.  Maybe you can work at Trader Joe's in the meantime. They have good pay and benefits.", "Wow. You managed to drain a seven figure inheritance in 4 years.\n\nYTA for pissing away your inheritance and leaving your daughter up a creek without support.", "You sound like a moron tbh", "For using the daughter's college fund for liquidity: there would be no holes here. If you have no other choice, the option needs to be on the table. There's no sense in being homeless with a college fund.\n\nHowever, for making the choices that got you to that place, ignoring your legal advice, and seemingly having no sense of your own (in)competence and getting into a scenario where liquidating the daughter's college fund is even a semi-viable option: YTA.\n\nThe only way you can rectify the situation is:\n\n1. Sell the house - Malibu starts at $3M and I don't know how big your mortgage is, but there should be some equity;\n2. Sell other assets too, e.g., do you have a $100k car?  Get a $30k car one, etc.\n3. Move e.g., to Calabassas or somewhere and live mortgage free, because you cannot be trusted;\n4. Reinstate the college fund;\n5. Start talking to an investor/money manager whom you can trust, and not someone who promises the world, and then, for the love of God, live within your (reduced) means;\n6. Forget about living off your business until you have taken care of your financial needs (and your daughter's) with your remaining assets, such as they are. If your business skills are on a par with your financial ones, there will never be an income from that business - and don't *ever* invest anything you can't afford to lose in that business.", "I've never seen a more financially illiterate individual.\n\nYou should be ashamed of how you have squandered a significant amount of money that could have provided for you and your daughter for your entire lives.\n\nDisgusting YTA", "Yta your stupidity is what drive you to where you are and you just fucked over your own daughters future doubling down. I hope she sues your dumb ass", "YTA,\n\nYour husband set you up financially for the rest of your life. Made sure your daughter had college paid for so she didn't have to worry about the debt later in life. I would also assume he had extra in there so she didn't have to work while also in college. I don't understand how you think any of this is ok. Your husband's lawyer is the most intelligent one in this post due to him calling you on your shit.\n\nYou could have moved to another state and lived on the beach for FAR LESS than you would in Malibu. Or just a thought. How about not selling your house at all? You essentially handed your daughter debt on a silver platter because you didn't want to have to deal with your current debt. Congrats on being a shitty parent.", "YTA. \n\nYour daughter could have had a future. Now that\u2019s in limbo because you wanted to be Malibu Barbie.", "YTA reading this litteraly made me pissed as fuck... You got 7 figures left over and a college fund left by your husband who told you HIMSELF to trust this lawyer after hes dead.. Im assuming its probably a smart choice and a trustable lawyer.. But nah lets just Fuck off the lawyer and not think as to why hes mad with the decision.. If i were you id sell the house and not take your daughters college funds and drain the rest off the cash left by your husband.", "YTA\n\npoor kid. your are irreponsible and crushed your daughter's oportunity for a good education", "YTA 1000% - your husband left you a ton of money plus a lawyer who clearly he trusted and was good with managing money and you ignored both of their wishes / instructions. You and your daughter could have lived comfortable long lives but now instead you have jeopardized her future and your own .", "YTA this was a poor decision after poor decision, you are saying 35k is enough for one mortgage payment, and upkeep, that house is far outside your price range. Your daugther is 16 she would be using those funds in a few years, there is no way your going to be able to replace that. Especially since your business would need to make enough to cover the expenses of the business, high mortgage and upkeep before even considering putting money aside.", "YTA. Sell your house that you cannot afford asap if you want to salvage this mess. You are just going to completely waste your daughter\u2019s college fund to buy a few more months in the house. Get out now and buy something much cheaper and start actually listening to sensible advice.", "YTA if you take your daughters college fund. She will likely never forgive you. It sounds like the only way to keep yourself from bankruptcy is to sell the house and live more modestly. The money is gone as well as the lifestyle. Stealing your daughters future will only buy you a little time before more bills come due. You need a lifestyle rehaul.", "Wow. YTA. Mega. Your husband set you and your daughter up and you destroyed it. Now you're making your daughter pay for YOUR financial mistakes. You really, truly suck. The only thing your late husband could've done better is to make sure you couldn't touch her money.", "This is honestly incredible. How destructive one person can be?

Move on.", "YTA You are incompetent. Contact your husband's lawyer and see if he is willing to help you. Don't touch your daughter's fund. You will lose that too.\n\nI hope your husband's lawyer is willing to help you. He might be able to set you up with a reputable financial advisor.  Probably it would be best to sell the house you can't afford. So far you have screwed up everything, do not screw up your daughter's future.", "YTA this entire thing is your fault.", "Definitely an asshole.  This was your daughter\u2019s future.  What would your husband have thought of your decision?  \n\nSell that house, put the college fund where it belongs, and learn from your mistakes!", "wtf, move to a cheaper place. What is the long term plan here? What happens after the money from the fund ends? YTA and an idiot", "Yes, definitely YTA. I\u2019m sorry for your loss, but it\u2019s clear that you have been unable to make any sane decisions for 4 years. That is a LOT of money to waste in such a short time. Plus, you can\u2019t fix your mistakes AND keep the house when the house was a mistake. Sell the house immediately; buy a cheap little 2BR house and save the proceeds for your daughter\u2019s college, and get a job at Target or a grocery store asap so that you can continue to pay your bills once your daughter leaves for college. How dare you sell your daughter\u2019s entire future for a home by the sea with an enormous amount of upkeep. \n\nCall that attorney back so s/he can figure out if there is any way to save this train wreck path you\u2019re on. \n\nLord, I hope this story is fake.

Put the money back.\nBuy something reasonably priced somewhere you can afford to live on the salary that you can make.", "YTA\n\nI am sorry you made poor financial decisions. This happens to a lot of people and it's horrible. Liquidating your daughter's college fund so you can spend a few more months in an outrageously expensive home is a poor move.

Wow. Yta big time.", "YTA\n\nDespite inheriting 7 figures AND the money from selling your previous home, you're already in serious financial trouble. Liquidating the college fund will not fix this.

I also have a 16yo daughter.\n\nMy late husband left me everything and told me to trust his lawyer. My husband had worked for 20 years as a doctor and did some minor investing so I inherited over 7 figures.\n\nA year later, I decided to list our home of 12 years and received an offer too good to refuse. With the inheritance as well as the influx of cash from selling the house, I decided to move my daughter and I to Malibu because we always dreamed of a home next to the beach but my husband was exceptionally tight fisted and called homes there money pits.\n\nWe found a beautiful home by the sea. I never personally handled anything regarding buying a home before so I did not anticipate all the extra costs beyond the sticker price. \n\nBut my daughter was so excited so I decided to go for it. My late husband's lawyer was furious at my decision so I decided stopped taking his calls. I ended up signing with a money manager who said that we'd be passively earning 90 percent of what surgeons earned per year.\n\nBut the money manager ended up tanking a lot of our investments. I took the dwindling money out and made my own investments which made it worse and long story short, because of all that I only have around $35k available to me now., not to mention our debts.\n\nWith the amount available to me, I am looking at only being able to pay 1 month of a mortgage/ upkeep and then I'm basically out of luck until my business gets clients. However, the place where we do have a significant amount of money is the fund my husband started for our daughter. With the money there, I could prevent our credit cards from being shut down, and not have to worry about the mortgage for many more months. \n\nSo I ended up liquidating my daughter's college fund. I told her about it today and she was furious and said she cannot believe all her dad's work is gone. Shea slo said she won't be supporting me for retirement. AITA for trying to fix my mistakes and trying to keep our house?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It took you 4 years to lose everything your husband earned  *and* your daughter\u2019s education. You\u2019ve poofed everything he worked so hard for her away to save *a few months* of your current situation, and soon enough you\u2019ll be posting in r/tifu about how your daughter\u2019s future is ruined because you wanted to live somewhere you couldn\u2019t afford. \n\nGood god, lady.

I assume you didn\u2019t sell in the past year, but once you\u2019re committed to living a job-free lifestyle with unreplenishable resources you don\u2019t touch your core assets, especially in California. Property taxes on your current place (12 year house, that puts the purchase near the bottom of the market in 2008-2010) are going to be lower than anything equivalent and you don\u2019t wanna mess with that.\n\nBut then ya did. I can\u2019t judge entirely. I\u2019m not sure I could live in the house I shared with my deceased spouse and not go a little crazy. So, instead of thinking to yourself \u201cI should buy a house of the same value in an area my daughter and I would want to live in so I\u2019m not \u2018spending\u2019 money, even if it\u2019s smaller\u201d you went and bought a goddamned beach palace you couldn\u2019t afford. Girl you make no money what the hell are you doing getting a mortgage at whatever bullshit interest rates we have today?\n\nNow, I don\u2019t blame you for wanting a fresh start with nice things, but maybe shoot for a lifestyle level *at* your old one not *above* it until you have an income source.\n\nThen ya panicked. You realized you didn\u2019t have the money. Finally. Instead of going to the person your husband trusted and vetted and hadn\u2019t fucked you for all these years you shopped around and fuckin surprise you got scammed. Finding a seven figure asset manager that has \u201chigh returns\u201d and won\u2019t fuck you without lots of experience finding asset managers is impossible.\n\nSo now you\u2019ve got a mortgage you can\u2019t afford, no cash, no work history, and you can no longer afford to pay the family lawyer even if you wanted to. You also bought a house at the start of the downturn. Instead of admitting defeat you cashed in your daughters college fund.\n\nUp until that point, you had only been incompetent. I won\u2019t say stupid, because you may be very smart and simply inexperienced. Shit happens. At that point you crossed the line from blundering incompetence to legally sanctioned theft of your own daughter. You\u2019re cashing in her future for short term gains that *will* go away.\n\nHere\u2019s how this is gonna go for you \u201cOP:\u201d you\u2019re gonna run out of cash and start missing mortgage payments. Your cards are gonna stop working one by one. At some point people are gonna come for your cars (I have a feeling you lease yours and don\u2019t own). Then your gonna get a foreclosure notice. At this point you\u2019re probably buying food and paying utilities with the money you\u2019re making from putting your guest rooms on AirBNB.\n\nThe bank is gonna come and and sell your house on the beach. The only car you have left is your husbands RAV4 or something because he was good with money and didn\u2019t like to be flashy, so he bought a cheap Toyota and selling a car just seems too hard to you. You\u2019re gonna spend some time living in that car. Your daughter will probably move in with a friend. Once the house sells you\u2019re going to get back probably 60-70% of whatever you put as a downpayment. Market is sinking after all.\n\nMaking a lot of assumptions here, that much money *would* last you a decade or more if you\u2019re not an idiot with it. But the credit cards. You\u2019re going to end up with maybe enough to live a year on the lifestyle you\u2019re used to, if you find a cheap rental.\n\nHere\u2019s what you should do: inform the old lawyer what you\u2019ve done. Beg him to take you back and unfuck this situation for you as much as possible. Take all of his advice.\n\nYour best case scenario: you\u2019re able to salvage enough to get a 2br condo somewhere in the OC. With clever investment and after paying back your kids college fund you\u2019ll be able to live a middle class lifestyle without a job for maybe 5 years. You\u2019re gonna need to get a job. Maybe your kid will help support you.\n\nWorst case: Lawyer won\u2019t talk to you and you\u2019re renting a crappy apartment in the valley working at an amazon warehouse and your kid hates you.\n\nWorser case: you cash out the rest of your \u201cdo not touch\u201d money and your kid hates you and you\u2019re both living in a car, which is then taken from you by a creditor in bankruptcy court.", "YTA and irresponsible and a bad mom.
