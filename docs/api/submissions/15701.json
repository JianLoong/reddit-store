She continues to pay me monthly and I have a decent job so I managed to find a place of my own. \nWell, over the last few months I found out my mother wasn't paying the full suppport to me.

I confronted her and told her that I need the money for uni and my apartment but she claimed what she's already paying me is more than enough and that i need to get my spending habits under control. I told her i can't work full time because of my degree but she simply didn't care. \nSince that money legally belongs to me I've decided to talk to a lawyer about suing her for the amount she owns me and the one she kept to herself all my life. I went through with it and we are now settling this through court. \n\nMy mom's husband begged me to drop it and said he would pay me around 1000\u20ac as compensation and that i need to think about the fact that they still have to pay off their house, that the dogs need food, that he has to support my sisters etc. Even my dad told me i was being too harsh on my mother. I simply don't care about that woman who's isolated me my whole childhood. AITA?\n\nEdit: I have 3 sisters and I'm the oldest brother. The only thing I'm concerned about is losing them in the process because i know i have to go no contact once this is settled.

First with the dogs, second with the money, it\u2019s clear that your mother doesn\u2019t love you like a parent should love their child. If your stepfather can\u2019t support his daughters without child support money he\u2019s helped steal from you, then he needs to get a better job, fix his spending habits, and stop having additional children.

I applied for a Wohngeldbescheid, and I am waiting for the results of that.\n* I've been working since I was 16 and before moving out my mom did take part of my money for rent, so there is a pattern.\n* My mom managed the child support and my dad is a very \"lets just keep it the way it always was\" type of guy. So he just kept paying my mom and trusted her to give it to me, even when I told him I dont get anything. \n* I am very happy with the rational comments I am receiving because I catch myself still trying to excuse her behavior - I love my parents dearly, I love my family.
