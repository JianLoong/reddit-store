To break it down, I have a terrible dog allergy and during my childhood and teenage years my mother decided it would be smart to not only get one, but 4. Through that she managed to completely isolate me from my family and i couldn't leave my room whenever i was home since the dogs were allowed everywhere and i couldn't stay in the room with them without being unable to breathe and constantly sneezing. I lived like that for 4 years before I had enough and moved onto my university campus.\nMy mother fought for me to stay, not because of me but because she would miss my dad's child support payments since she was legally required to give them to me now. \nOur relationship became pretty frosty, but at one point we sat down and had a conversation and I thought things were now okay. She continues to pay me monthly and I have a decent job so I managed to find a place of my own. \nWell, over the last few months I found out my mother wasn't paying the full suppport to me. It was about 200\u20ac less than it should be which she kept. I confronted her and told her that I need the money for uni and my apartment but she claimed what she's already paying me is more than enough and that i need to get my spending habits under control. I told her i can't work full time because of my degree but she simply didn't care. \nSince that money legally belongs to me I've decided to talk to a lawyer about suing her for the amount she owns me and the one she kept to herself all my life. I went through with it and we are now settling this through court. \n\nMy mom's husband begged me to drop it and said he would pay me around 1000\u20ac as compensation and that i need to think about the fact that they still have to pay off their house, that the dogs need food, that he has to support my sisters etc. Even my dad told me i was being too harsh on my mother. I simply don't care about that a woman who's isolated me my whole childhood. AITA?\n\nEdit: I have 3 sisters and I'm the oldest brother. The only thing I'm concerned about is losing them in the process because i know i have to go no contact once this is settled. She's already been calling me non stop and i blocked her number and she's been using my sister to contact me. She's a really good manipulator so I'm really worried and wondering if this is all worth it.", "created_utc": 1682494706, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12za2nl/aita_for_suing_my_mother_and_her_husband_over/", "score": 101, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I find it comical that you were told to get your spending under control by the people who are stealing your money to be able to afford dog food for the dogs that are the reason you had to move in the first place.", "NTA. What your mom's husband and dad expect from you is being the \"bigger person\" but ask yourself: Is your mom ever gonna make it up to you? Will she be thankful to you for letting it drop? Is your relationship with your mom even worth it to you anymore?\n\nI mean I absolutely love my dog, I would quit a relationship over my dog. But getting a dog when your child is allergic!? What nonsense is this???", "NTA, let's see. She was knowingly endangering and confining you with her dogs and then stealing from you. Go on with full force.", "NTA\n\nYou don't have to be the bigger person here. Your mom won't even be grateful to you for it.\nAbsolutely nonsensical to get a dog when you have an allergic child.", "NTA - Imo, she is abusive is stealing from you. Its funny that they want you to be the bigger person except going through the legal system will make you the bigger person since you are letting the law judge them not you.\n\nThe husband has definitely calculated that the amount she owes you is much greater than 1000 which is why he wants to pay you off. Don't accept and stick to your guns. If there are legal fees try and get her to pay them as well since you wouldn't have had to go to court if she hadn't stolen from you in the first place.\n\nAlso, by going the legal route you are teaching your sisters to stand up for themselves and not be a people pleaser.", "NTA. This is money owed to you and you are doing the right thing by letting a lawyer deal with it", "NTA. Take them to the cleaners!

It just depends on if you are willing to destroy your relationship with your mother for it.", "I'm unfamiliar with this law. In the usa child support doesn't transfer to the child like that so idk?", "NTA. This money was rightfully owed to you, and she fraudulently kept it from you. The dog stuff is outrageous! It\u2019s not illegal but it\u2019s immoral. I say you should go balls to the wall and let her (and that husband of hers) have a taste of what having an allergic reaction is like.", "NTA\n\n\nI hate when parents tell their kids to manage their expenses better when they themselves are relying on their kids' money to pay their own bills. They should have been more responsible with their money before they decided to buy a house, 4 dogs, and have more kids than they could afford without your money.", "NTA they endangered your health for years and stole from you, they deserve it.", "Nta. I went and read your confession post and honestly your mom sounds terrible. She didn't at all care about you or your health as a kid and neglected you. You wanted love and affection but had to be a prisoner in your own room. Her telling you to get your spending habits under control when it's your money she's withholding is ironic, and she's the one who wasted cash on 4 dogs she can't seem pay for without taking yours. Your dad might mean well saying you're too harsh but he clearly doesn't understand the amount of emotional negligent you probably felt as a kid.", "NTA, tell him it 2000 or nothing.", "Sue them!", "NTA  \n\n\nDrag their asses.

Your mother should take her own advice to get *her* spending under control. One thought - can your father give the money directly to you?", "NTA", "NTA OP.  Keep up with the lawsuit, and also see if you can press charges for theft.", "NTA and in fact your mom is the thief and has been stealing from both you and your dad.", "NTA. Take the fact you're related out of the matter, and she skimmed money off of payments legally entitled to you, and she forced you to live in a house with animals you're allergic to. If you wouldn't accept it from a stranger, it's not acceptable from a family member.\n\nSide note, like, there's hypoallergenic breeds. You CAN have dogs that are okay for people with allergies (as I understand it at least). She chose to get breeds that would hurt you.", "based on the fact that they mentioned for the one they didnt receive I'm guessing that means the ones that they were owed living under their roof, so itll likely amount to much much much more than just 1000. step daddy realized how much they fucked up and is now trying to scam OP out of what they're owed", "She destroyed the relationship being abusive to a child by basically torturing him with allergies.

They should go for the lot.", "He wants to give it directly to me from now on but he also said the lawsuit is too much and that she probably only took what she needs since my mom has a lot of debt. I don't know. It's hard for me to feel sorry for her at all.", "the words you may have been looking for are:medical, financial, mental, and emotional abuse!\n\nsource:he couldn't leave his room due to his allergy this is medical abuse as she knowingly put him in this situation and forced him to live with it. the stealing from him and the fact that the child support she received for him didnt seem to go to him which sounds illegal I know it is in the us but idk about where they are. she actively isolated him from family and are now using them as flying monkeys. based on this alone its not a stretch to assume there's lots else we dont know", "Ohohoh... so wait are you talking about the support from your dad or about the Kindergeld or both?\n\nCause now I'm quite curious. In Germany you're entitled to quite a lot of money from your parents until your finished your degree (or are 25 I think)...", "Wow. But that money has to be handed over to the 18-25 yr old?  or is it like it is in the usa a payment to the primary caregiver to compensate for their time and extra money they have spent on the \"kid\" ?", "If your mom has a lot of debt, then maybe she should have gotten her spending under control years ago. \n\n\nAlso, NTA.", "It's both actually - my mom's account is put down for both the Kindergeld and the Unterhalt. And she's keeping parts of both.", "Depending. When you live with a caregiver, they get the money. So rent, utilities, groceries etc can be covered. If the kid moves Out the kid gets it to pay for the stuff themselves. This means child Support and Kindergeld - Money you get every month from the government. Both continue 18+ with the condition the child proves they so something useful: like appreticeship, College, certain volunteer things or is officialjy registriert as \"Job hunting\".", "In most countries the child support is labelled to everything needed to give the child a proper living. So a part of it can be used for housing. (not all, there must also be money for food, clothing, education etc) So getting it back from the period you lived at home could be hard since you need to be able to proof the money  was not used for you. But from the moment you moved out it is 100% for you", "That's so cool. Thank you for educating us about it."]}
