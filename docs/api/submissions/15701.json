{"id": 15701, "submission_id": "12za2nl", "title": "AITA for suing my mother and her husband over child support payments?", "selftext": "Unfournately this is a story that continued from a previously offmychest story. To break it down, I have a terrible dog allergy and during my childhood and teenage years my mother decided it would be smart to not only get one, but 4. Through that she managed to completely isolate me from my family and i couldn't leave my room whenever i was home since the dogs were allowed everywhere and i couldn't stay in the room with them without being unable to breathe and constantly sneezing. I lived like that for 4 years before I had enough and moved onto my university campus.\nMy mother fought for me to stay, not because of me but because she would miss my dad's child support payments since she was legally required to give them to me now. \nOur relationship became pretty frosty, but at one point we sat down and had a conversation and I thought things were now okay. She continues to pay me monthly and I have a decent job so I managed to find a place of my own. \nWell, over the last few months I found out my mother wasn't paying the full suppport to me. It was about 200\u20ac less than it should be which she kept. I confronted her and told her that I need the money for uni and my apartment but she claimed what she's already paying me is more than enough and that i need to get my spending habits under control. I told her i can't work full time because of my degree but she simply didn't care. \nSince that money legally belongs to me I've decided to talk to a lawyer about suing her for the amount she owns me and the one she kept to herself all my life. I went through with it and we are now settling this through court. \n\nMy mom's husband begged me to drop it and said he would pay me around 1000\u20ac as compensation and that i need to think about the fact that they still have to pay off their house, that the dogs need food, that he has to support my sisters etc. Even my dad told me i was being too harsh on my mother. I simply don't care about that woman who's isolated me my whole childhood. AITA?\n\nEdit: I have 3 sisters and I'm the oldest brother. The only thing I'm concerned about is losing them in the process because i know i have to go no contact once this is settled. She's already been calling me non stop and i blocked her number and she's been using my sister to contact me. She's a really good manipulator so I'm really worried and wondering if this is all worth it.\n\nEdit 2: Originally added as a comment - Hi guys, thank you for all the comments this really is giving me a lot of reassurance that I am doing the right thing, I can't thank everyone individually but all the well wishes mean the world to me and show me I am not alone in this mess. I didn't expect this much support but it means a lot, can't lie about the fact that I've been scrolling all day and since then felt a lot better. As to some of the questions:\n\nMy sisters are 18, 12 and 9, the oldest is my step sister (daughter of my moms new husband), the other two are half siblings of mine. They mean the world to me, I feel very protective of them, and I did everything I could in my situation to be a good brother to them. At the moment I am also trying to support my oldest younger sister with her wish to move out. She might move in with me. I hope I can keep contact through them in secret or through my grandma, I am very scared of losing my youngest sister.\n\nTo the germans in the comments, I don't get baf\u00f6g, my parents are both really well off, and I tried multiple times, explaining my situation, I dont get anything that would support me. I applied for a Wohngeldbescheid, and I am waiting for the results of that.\n\nI've been working since I was 16 and before moving out my mom did take part of my money for rent, so there is a pattern.\n\nMy mom managed the child support and my dad is a very \"lets just keep it the way it always was\" type of guy. So he just kept paying my mom and trusted her to give it to me, even when I told him I dont get anything.\n\nI am very happy with the rational comments I am receiving because I catch myself still trying to excuse her behavior - I love my parents dearly, I love my family. I dont want to be in this situation, but at the same time I dont see what else I can do.\n\nThank you for your support I promise to keep posting updates.", "created_utc": 1682494706, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12za2nl/aita_for_suing_my_mother_and_her_husband_over/", "score": 3757, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
