She continues to pay me monthly and I have a decent job so I managed to find a place of my own. \nWell, over the last few months I found out my mother wasn't paying the full suppport to me.

I went through with it and we are now settling this through court. \n\nMy mom's husband begged me to drop it and said he would pay me around 1000\u20ac as compensation and that i need to think about the fact that they still have to pay off their house, that the dogs need food, that he has to support my sisters etc. Even my dad told me i was being too harsh on my mother. I simply don't care about that woman who's isolated me my whole childhood. AITA?\n\nEdit: I have 3 sisters and I'm the oldest brother. The only thing I'm concerned about is losing them in the process because i know i have to go no contact once this is settled.

It\u2019s not wrong at all to legally retrieve the money that was yours in the first place. First with the dogs, second with the money, it\u2019s clear that your mother doesn\u2019t love you like a parent should love their child. If your stepfather can\u2019t support his daughters without child support money he\u2019s helped steal from you, then he needs to get a better job, fix his spending habits, and stop having additional children.
