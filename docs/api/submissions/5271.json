But she gave me a horrific childhood and my dad died when we were all young so I was left to watch her dote on my siblings and treat me like shit. I got to hear all the time that I ruined her life, that she wished she had aborted me, that she dreamed of me dying and getting relief of knowing she'd never have to see me again. I ended up staying with friends from the age of 15 and I hadn't seen her since my 20th birthday, when she showed up with my siblings and told me she wanted to puke just looking at me.\n\nI never told her I was gay, never introduced her to my husband or my children. When my siblings called to tell me she was dying I was so happy. Knowing she's gone, knowing that the woman who hated me for reasons out of my control, who made sure I know how much she never wanted me, filled me with such a feeling of relief.\n\nBut of course my siblings are heartbroken. They wanted me to be involved. I told them no way, no how. I said she was a great mother to them and that was fine, but she was evil to me, she was evil and made my childhood hell and I was not some grieving son and was not spending a single second giving her a nice send off, or spending a single cent on it either.\n\nThey got mad. Told me it should be split between all of us. They had already planned her obituary and told me how bad I would look if I didn't help plan, didn't show up. I told them to get my name off the obituary because the woman they described was not my mother. We argued. They told me I was behaving just as badly as her by taking it out on them when they did nothing wrong. I told them I just wanted them to leave me out of it. I told them to pretend we're half siblings, and I have a different mother out there, if it helps. They told me I could at least do it for them and to think about how hard this has been for them.\n\nThe fighting just keeps on going and it actually delayed the funeral planning since they spend more time trying to convince me than doing any planning. They keep asking for my opinion, etc. Trying to draw me in. Then get mad and tell me I am treating them badly.

However if I may offer a tiny bit of an insight maybe. My mom was in a rather similar situation. She was NC with her parents for a long time by the time her father passed, at which point she learned that he officially disowned her a few weeks before. Her childhood was something out of a horror movie. So she did not plan on going to the funeral, but had a wreath made to be sent there with a ribbon saying something along the lines of \"from the kid you betreyed and abused\" . It did make her feel better. She had every right to be crazy angry, it would've been justified if she went there and bulldosed the whole funeral home. BUT like an hour before the wreath was to be sent off she changed her mind and ran to the florist to ask the ribbon to be changed to something like \"I'm saying goodbye\" . Not because she lost her nerve. She lost her hatered. And it made her feel even better. (Sidenote, the florist's face showed how many times she saw this scenario before. It's heartbreaking to think how many parents are horrible as heck.) \nSo what I'm trying to say: without wanting to tell you what's best for you, the human mind and emotions are weird. So please try and not be consumed by your - however justified - negative emotions. It is entirely possible that it would actually feel better to look back at this moment if you did participate to an extent, especially if your relationship with your siblings is good. I certainly would not pay a cent for this funeral, but maybe some small conpromise could be made for your siblings' sake. But again, if what you need is to stay totally out, do that.

Do not engage with them.", "NTA, OP.\n\nPersonally, I think you're taking the high road.

Where were they your whole life when your Mom was literally wishing for your death IN FRONT OF THEM?  They probably couldn't say anything as kids, but they could have done something as adults.  They chose not to because she was good to them and they didn't want to rock the boat.  Well, boat's rockin.  Deal with it. NTA.", "NTA.\n\nAre they completely oblivious to the relationship you had with your mother?", "Not at all. She doesn\u2019t deserve a second more of your time. I am so sorry you had a shitty mom. My grandma was shitty to my mom and her two sisters (but wonderful to all of her brothers) and she still hangs on to anger about it. I hope you find peace in knowing it wasn\u2019t you. It was her. Now go hug your hubby and your kids and enjoy your life without her. \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA. You should suggest paying for the DJ, champagne and other party favors.", " NTA. I\u2019m so sorry she is haunting you even in death. Your siblings are so selfish right now.\n\nSoon this will all pass. Keep your head up while you\u2019re in the thick of it. Best wishes.", "NTA.  I'm your experience twin. My mother was horrid to me my whole life. About 18 mos before she died, she finally admitted that she'd hated me literally from birth bevs I had the gall to be born when she was  18 and becs my grandmother love me so much. When she died, my first response was \"she can't hurt me anymore\"  NTA. You do what you need to do to heal. Childhood trauma is real. And it damages for life.", "NTA what horrible people they are. They are as bad as your mother. They watched you being abused. They knew your mother hated you. I\u2019m not saying they could do anything about it, they could not because they were children. But they absolutely were aware. And now, instead of acknowledging it, they ask you for money and say you should move past. That\u2019s despicable; absolutely despicable.", "NTA. I\u2019m so sorry. You didn\u2019t deserve that childhood, and your siblings need to do their own work to grapple with the fact that the mom they loved also treated you atrociously. It\u2019s not your job to erase or overlook that fact for them.", "To be honest, the way you describe your interaction with your siblings, this all seems to be way more about 'who is paying' then 'lets get our Brother involved, because ...(enter some altruistic Reasons here)). Stay strong, there is (in my Opinion) no reason whatsoever to pay for a nice farewell for your Abuser. I wish you only the best of luck.", "YTA.\n\nYour feelings towards your mom are justified, and I understand your unwillingness to honor her memory.\n\nBut your siblings are grieving and overwhelmed, and since you are not negatively affected by the death, you should help them out.", "Yta and I can see why she hated you.", "Great time to steal the spotlight and make it all about you yes you are the asshole", "This.. They don't care about you. Only the money. Go NC. NTA.", "This is the only way their being nagging ah's makes sense.", "Exactly. Theyre even delaying the funeral trying to wear OP down.", "Tell them to leave you the f*** alone that no means no what part do they not understand she was their mother not yours you don't want to have anything to do with her you're not going to the funeral and you're not giving them any f****** money case closed", "OP should write their own obit to send out if they keep fucking around", "Darn, so petty and evil and so so fair!", "They were there, they know. They just want the LW to kick in thousands of dollars for this funeral they're planning. People raised by monsters who were nice to *them* can have really warped realities.", "Somethings tells me she didn\u2019t leave him anything anyway.", "I would. Assuming the person wasn't evil to me. But I hate the idea of helping give her a nice send off. That's where the issue is. I'd love to just leave her to rot and end up forgotten.", "Nope, no way, no how. OP ignore this person.\n\nThe siblings are continuing the mom\u2019s legacy of abuse by harassing OP about this. Grief doesn\u2019t give anyone the right to be an asshole which is how the siblings are acting.", "OP\u2019s mom, is this you coming back from the grave?", "So edgy.  You're so cool.", "What!? OP doesn't want it about him, he wants left out of it. You sound like one of the siblings.", "Lmao right because wanting to be left alone is making it about himself. They are just as shitty as their mother was they never cared he was being treated like shit and now they want him to help pay for his abusers funeral absolutely not its clearly about the mother and them as it has been all of Ops life he should block them all and live his happy life in peace.", "Or tell them if they put you in that you will make a counter obituary and have it placed in the same places.", "NTA!  But this is just great! Love it.\n\nBLOCK THEM!", "Funny story, or not, but when I got informed my father was dead I was woken up from a nap to be told. All I said was \"ding dong the prick is dead\" and then I went back to sleep. Yeahhhh he was a total ba$tard to me growing up...", "Ding dong the warlock is dead just doesn't work as well in my case.", "If I were OP I'd pay for that.", "They would have no one to blame but themselves if OP does this Lmao", "My aunt would have said like this. If OP says this, the siblings might shut up.", "Or, OP could offer to split the costs if he can write the obit and it gets published, without changes.", "Turn up to the funeral in a party hat?", "I had exactly the same thought.", "A few years ago I remember reading an article where two siblings did something like this. Basically their mom dumped them on their grandparents and ran off with some other man and had kids with him. They'd see her once a year when she'd come home for a week and that was it. Finally she died in another state and those siblings had a obituary for her. So the two siblings made one which basically said something along the lines of what you said. Not quiet ding dong the witch is dead but \"well she ran off and abandoned two kids to have kids with another man and seemed to love them while forgetting her two oldest...", "I agree. They don\u2019t want the world to know their mom was horrible to OP.", "I have a feeling the delay is they need your help with the cost but aren\u2019t coming out and just saying that.

I don\u2019t understand because my mother was abusive and we were estranged for years before she passed, but I get that you must be going through a lot of grief right now.

NTA.", "I'm sorry, but the siblings refusal to take no for an answer and then trying to gaslight him by claiming he is hurting them as as as the mother hurt him, means he owes them absolutely nothing. \n\nAnd nowhere in this post did I get that he had an ongoing cordial relationship with his siblings. They contacted him because their mom was dying and they expected him to pretend they had the perfect family ... and chip in money for the funeral. \n\nI'm glad you maintained a good relationship with your sister, but your sister is not the OP's siblings.

I thought he was very considerate in acknowledging that their reality was very different from his. He didn't blame them for what happened to him. He was very calm in setting his boundaries and they were very reasonable IMO. . \n\nThey took that to mean that they could try and guilt him into doing what they wanted. They get a partial pass for grieving but they were not ignorant their mom's treatment of the OP since they were all present during his final confrontation with the mother.", "Doesn't everyone?", "Yes damnit", "If anyone ever needs to talk to someone who's gone through it, seriously, message me. A person who knows what you're going through is invaluable. There are some wonderful, well-meaning people out there that just don't know how it feels, and I hope they never do. But you're right, us scrappy kids have to stick together."]}
