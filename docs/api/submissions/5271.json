But she gave me a horrific childhood and my dad died when we were all young so I was left to watch her dote on my siblings and treat me like shit. I got to hear all the time that I ruined her life, that she wished she had aborted me, that she dreamed of me dying and getting relief of knowing she'd never have to see me again. I ended up staying with friends from the age of 15 and I hadn't seen her since my 20th birthday, when she showed up with my siblings and told me she wanted to puke just looking at me.\n\nI never told her I was gay, never introduced her to my husband or my children. When my siblings called to tell me she was dying I was so happy. Knowing she's gone, knowing that the woman who hated me for reasons out of my control, who made sure I know how much she never wanted me, filled me with such a feeling of relief.\n\nBut of course my siblings are heartbroken. They wanted me to be involved. I told them no way, no how. I said she was a great mother to them and that was fine, but she was evil to me, she was evil and made my childhood hell and I was not some grieving son and was not spending a single second giving her a nice send off, or spending a single cent on it either.\n\nThey got mad. Told me it should be split between all of us. They had already planned her obituary and told me how bad I would look if I didn't help plan, didn't show up. I told them to get my name off the obituary because the woman they described was not my mother. We argued. They told me I was behaving just as badly as her by taking it out on them when they did nothing wrong. I told them I just wanted them to leave me out of it. I told them to pretend we're half siblings, and I have a different mother out there, if it helps. They told me I could at least do it for them and to think about how hard this has been for them.\n\nThe fighting just keeps on going and it actually delayed the funeral planning since they spend more time trying to convince me than doing any planning. They keep asking for my opinion, etc. Trying to draw me in. Then get mad and tell me I am treating them badly.

However if I may offer a tiny bit of an insight maybe. My mom was in a rather similar situation. She was NC with her parents for a long time by the time her father passed, at which point she learned that he officially disowned her a few weeks before. Her childhood was something out of a horror movie. So she did not plan on going to the funeral, but had a wreath made to be sent there with a ribbon saying something along the lines of \"from the kid you betreyed and abused\" . It did make her feel better. She had every right to be crazy angry, it would've been justified if she went there and bulldosed the whole funeral home. BUT like an hour before the wreath was to be sent off she changed her mind and ran to the florist to ask the ribbon to be changed to something like \"I'm saying goodbye\" . Not because she lost her nerve. She lost her hatered. And it made her feel even better. (Sidenote, the florist's face showed how many times she saw this scenario before. It's heartbreaking to think how many parents are horrible as heck.) \nSo what I'm trying to say: without wanting to tell you what's best for you, the human mind and emotions are weird. So please try and not be consumed by your - however justified - negative emotions. It is entirely possible that it would actually feel better to look back at this moment if you did participate to an extent, especially if your relationship with your siblings is good. I certainly would not pay a cent for this funeral, but maybe some small conpromise could be made for your siblings' sake. But again, if what you need is to stay totally out, do that.

Do not engage with them.", "NTA, OP.\n\nPersonally, I think you're taking the high road.

Our father died at 47, 17 years after becoming a quadriplegic from his drinking and driving partying habit that encouraged him to abandon us.\n\nOur father was never really a parent to us, even in our teenage years when he had visitation rights and reliably used them.  He was involved but time does not easily heal a childhood of being abandoned.  He was a decent grandfather to our children, invested in all the details and doting on our little ones.\n\nWhen we attended his funeral and had a chance to choose to go up and speak, we both chose on the spot not to share our truth.  Instead, we honored those present who mourned the man our father had become and didn't know his history.  There's a Deathcab For Cutie song that describes it best as using \"five dollar words and praising his integrity.\"  Without even discussing it, we made the mutual decision that we would mourn who he should have been separately from that setting and spare the extra hurt our truth would have caused.\n\nThe kindness was not at all for our father and 100% about the kind of people we want to be.  We deserve to decide that for ourselves along with what we can handle in support of those we love.\n\nOP is NTA.  Grieve how you need to, even if that's celebrating that the source of so much pain can no longer hurt you.  You are not required to contribute to the image of a mother who wasn't a mother to you to help others grieve.  These are people who were not able to influence her treatment of you in her lifetime.  Why should protecting her memory for those who didn't protect you be any kind of priority?", "Correct, she can do no wrong. She is, however, still a woman and women in his world are t even second rate citizens\u2026 She does no wrong because she does as he asks- she makes and delivers his meals, takes him to appointments, gets his groceries and cleans the house. She has cancelled vacations, used her own PTO for him and makes sure his cigarettes never run out. He does have a caregiver come to assist a few times a week with hygiene things but otherwise, she is the \u201cperfect woman.\u201dHe yells at her and she, in her words, lets it go in one ear and out the other. I have been there as he has lectured her on \u201cproper\u201d ways to do things. Just because she can do no wrong, he sings her praises and she is \u201cin the will\u201d does not mean she was t and isn\u2019t abused. Women are to be ordered around, kept in line and be submissive. \nShe is, the perfect woman around him with the exception of working outside the home and not raising her sons \u201cproperly.\u201d To her, he is dad and family and she feels a need to deal with it. \u201cIt\u2019s who he is. He had a rough childhood.\u201d \nI can psycho-analyze the situation and say why I think she does it\u2026 but at the end of the day she is a grown woman and has to make her choices. She already got the house, she will get what little else is left. She, of course gets all the praise for sticking with him too. She also still loves him. He has no money to speak of and if there is any insurance she can have it- it was more than \u201cearned.\u201d We both know, there likely isn\u2019t any though. \nI was allowed to be harmed by an uncle and cousins with dad knowing (sis didn\u2019t know at the time), I have been called names and am a horrible excuse for a woman. I can go on, it was bad. \nYes, we communicated in advance. She accepted because otherwise we would have 0 relationship. She doesn\u2019t like it but came to understand. She can accept what I have to offer in this area or leave it. I CAN\u2019T be a part of any funeral for him mentally. \nListen, I get OPs siblings SUCK. I read from the post though that prior to mom\u2019s death they have/had some form of at least friendly relationship. Maybe I\u2019m wrong\u2026 If OP is looking for another route, this is something to consider. If OP wants to go NC with siblings now too- that is up to OP. I don\u2019t know how much he loves siblings or how close they were before mom\u2019s death. \nKids don\u2019t get to choose how they are brought up. As adults they can and should acknowledge any differences and look at things without the rose colored glasses. However, parents can do a number on kids mentally that goes well into the adult years. It took me until I was 40 to see that my sis was and is abused psychologically and that while she KNOWS what he did to me, she had her own demons that she can\u2019t get rid of. \nOP needs to decide if they are ready to cut ties with siblings right now. And while he doesn\u2019t love his mom and feels relief, he may not be ready to say goodbye to the rest of the family now- or ever. Only OP knows this. \nI\u2019m only suggesting something for OP to CONSIDER a less involved option, IF they WANT to maintain some sort of relationship. If he doesn\u2019t then of course, block them and go NC.", "I am sorry you were dealt such a shitty hand. I am experiencing the same situation sadly, except mine isn\u2019t even kind enough to be dead yet.", "NTA, but your mom is dead. Nothing you do or don't do will benefit or hurt her. It might hurt your siblings though so just be mindful of that when you talk to them."]}
