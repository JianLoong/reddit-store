My siblings were all with her when she died. I was not. She was a bully to me and hated my guts as long as I can remember. Not sure if it was the fact I was the kid who looked so much like dad, the fact she was young when she got pregnant with me and resented me for it, or whether I was just unlucky. But she gave me a horrific childhood and my dad died when we were all young so I was left to watch her dote on my siblings and treat me like shit. I got to hear all the time that I ruined her life, that she wished she had aborted me, that she dreamed of me dying and getting relief of knowing she'd never have to see me again. I ended up staying with friends from the age of 15 and I hadn't seen her since my 20th birthday, when she showed up with my siblings and told me she wanted to puke just looking at me.\n\nI never told her I was gay, never introduced her to my husband or my children. When my siblings called to tell me she was dying I was so happy. Knowing she's gone, knowing that the woman who hated me for reasons out of my control, who made sure I know how much she never wanted me, filled me with such a feeling of relief.\n\nBut of course my siblings are heartbroken. They wanted me to be involved. I told them no way, no how. I said she was a great mother to them and that was fine, but she was evil to me, she was evil and made my childhood hell and I was not some grieving son and was not spending a single second giving her a nice send off, or spending a single cent on it either.\n\nThey got mad. Told me it should be split between all of us. They had already planned her obituary and told me how bad I would look if I didn't help plan, didn't show up. I told them to get my name off the obituary because the woman they described was not my mother. We argued. They told me I was behaving just as badly as her by taking it out on them when they did nothing wrong. I told them I just wanted them to leave me out of it. I told them to pretend we're half siblings, and I have a different mother out there, if it helps. They told me I could at least do it for them and to think about how hard this has been for them.\n\nThe fighting just keeps on going and it actually delayed the funeral planning since they spend more time trying to convince me than doing any planning. They keep asking for my opinion, etc. Trying to draw me in. Then get mad and tell me I am treating them badly.

How dare they now gaslight you just so they can split the funeral costs with you.", "NTA\n\n\nWhy would you help? They know how she treated you.", "NTA, she was their mother not yours. It was your mom\u2019s choice. Tell if it makes them feel any better your mother would probably prefer you weren\u2019t at her funeral. So you\u2019re just doing what your mom would have wanted. Plus they suck for not standing up for you and calling out your late mother\u2019s treatment of you.", "NTA. I think your feelings are valid and response is appropriate.", "NTA of course. However if I may offer a tiny bit of an insight maybe. My mom was in a rather similar situation. She was NC with her parents for a long time by the time her father passed, at which point she learned that he officially disowned her a few weeks before. Her childhood was something out of a horror movie. So she did not plan on going to the funeral, but had a wreath made to be sent there with a ribbon saying something along the lines of \"from the kid you betreyed and abused\" . It did make her feel better. She had every right to be crazy angry, it would've been justified if she went there and bulldosed the whole funeral home. BUT like an hour before the wreath was to be sent off she changed her mind and ran to the florist to ask the ribbon to be changed to something like \"I'm saying goodbye\" . Not because she lost her nerve. She lost her hatered. And it made her feel even better. (Sidenote, the florist's face showed how many times she saw this scenario before. It's heartbreaking to think how many parents are horrible as heck.) \nSo what I'm trying to say: without wanting to tell you what's best for you, the human mind and emotions are weird. So please try and not be consumed by your - however justified - negative emotions. It is entirely possible that it would actually feel better to look back at this moment if you did participate to an extent, especially if your relationship with your siblings is good. I certainly would not pay a cent for this funeral, but maybe some small conpromise could be made for your siblings' sake. But again, if what you need is to stay totally out, do that. It's your life.", "NTA you have done enough for them when you were forced into a parental role\n\nIts about time they show you some understanding aswell", "NTA and block them all. So sorry you went through this, she was a vile woman.", "My siblings did this when my mother finally OD\u2019d and died. My dad said, \u2018tell them you went to a notary and signed away your rights as next of kin\u2019, so next time they called, I repeated that line. Phone never rang again. NTA love \ud83e\udd0d sorry you had to go thru this.", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019re not taking it out on them. You just want nothing to with her in death as in life.\n\nI\u2019m so very sorry your mother treated you this way and I hope this brings you some closure.\n\nOne line stood out to me: \u201cI said she was a great mother to them \u2026\u201d She wasn\u2019t, though. She modelled awful behaviour and showed blatant favouritism. And it\u2019s carried all the way through to them now expecting you to prioritise their current grief over your long-term trauma.", "NTA. Do not engage with them.", "NTA, OP.\n\nPersonally, I think you're taking the high road. If I was the one in your shoes, I would most likely tell them that, if they insist on you being part of the whole event, then they should expect you to show up for the funeral, singing \"Ding, Dong, the Witch Is Dead\" from *The Wizard of Oz*.\n\nMy own pettiness aside, I respect the fact that you've continued to try and convey that you understand just how much of a difficult time this must be for your siblings. It's they, however, who seem to not get the fact that you really don't share in their troubles. What, for them, is a tragedy is, for you, a blessing from above (or below, depending on where she might be headed).", "NTA but for your own sake accept that your siblings are also damaged by your mums abuse and may not be safe for you.\n\nMy mum had a similar childhood to the one you describe. Her mum doted on her younger sister and my grandad died when they were young. My 70 year old aunt still believes what her mother told her- that my mum was just born bad and would ruin everything she touches - and she spent decades punishing my mum. About 15 years ago I finally begged my mum to cut all contact and it's so much better for her. My aunt, ironically, misses her.", "NTA I don't know if it would shut them down, but you could write your own obituary for her and give it to them and tell them you will  not now or ever celebrate the life of someone who abused you so relentlessly. Then refuse to discuss anything relating to her or the funeral. If they want to talk about it, leave, hang up the phone, or get busy elsewhere.", "This 100%", "How can someone whose mother loved them, who didn't abuse them, who didn't tell them they regretted them living, ever understand what it is like to have a mother who made their life a nightmare. \n\n\nSure they can understand the objective concept, but not the cold dark reality. \n\n\nI know my siblings don't understand, and part of that is I stood between the worst of my mother and them all of my life. \n\nNta"]}
