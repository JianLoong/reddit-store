My siblings were all with her when she died. I was not. She was a bully to me and hated my guts as long as I can remember. Not sure if it was the fact I was the kid who looked so much like dad, the fact she was young when she got pregnant with me and resented me for it, or whether I was just unlucky. But she gave me a horrific childhood and my dad died when we were all young so I was left to watch her dote on my siblings and treat me like shit. I got to hear all the time that I ruined her life, that she wished she had aborted me, that she dreamed of me dying and getting relief of knowing she'd never have to see me again. I ended up staying with friends from the age of 15 and I hadn't seen her since my 20th birthday, when she showed up with my siblings and told me she wanted to puke just looking at me.\n\nI never told her I was gay, never introduced her to my husband or my children. When my siblings called to tell me she was dying I was so happy. Knowing she's gone, knowing that the woman who hated me for reasons out of my control, who made sure I know how much she never wanted me, filled me with such a feeling of relief.\n\nBut of course my siblings are heartbroken. They wanted me to be involved. I told them no way, no how. I said she was a great mother to them and that was fine, but she was evil to me, she was evil and made my childhood hell and I was not some grieving son and was not spending a single second giving her a nice send off, or spending a single cent on it either.\n\nThey got mad. Told me it should be split between all of us. They had already planned her obituary and told me how bad I would look if I didn't help plan, didn't show up. I told them to get my name off the obituary because the woman they described was not my mother. We argued. They told me I was behaving just as badly as her by taking it out on them when they did nothing wrong. I told them I just wanted them to leave me out of it. I told them to pretend we're half siblings, and I have a different mother out there, if it helps. They told me I could at least do it for them and to think about how hard this has been for them.\n\nThe fighting just keeps on going and it actually delayed the funeral planning since they spend more time trying to convince me than doing any planning. They keep asking for my opinion, etc. Trying to draw me in. Then get mad and tell me I am treating them badly.

However if I may offer a tiny bit of an insight maybe. My mom was in a rather similar situation. She was NC with her parents for a long time by the time her father passed, at which point she learned that he officially disowned her a few weeks before. Her childhood was something out of a horror movie. So she did not plan on going to the funeral, but had a wreath made to be sent there with a ribbon saying something along the lines of \"from the kid you betreyed and abused\" . It did make her feel better. She had every right to be crazy angry, it would've been justified if she went there and bulldosed the whole funeral home. BUT like an hour before the wreath was to be sent off she changed her mind and ran to the florist to ask the ribbon to be changed to something like \"I'm saying goodbye\" . Not because she lost her nerve. She lost her hatered. And it made her feel even better. (Sidenote, the florist's face showed how many times she saw this scenario before. It's heartbreaking to think how many parents are horrible as heck.) \nSo what I'm trying to say: without wanting to tell you what's best for you, the human mind and emotions are weird. So please try and not be consumed by your - however justified - negative emotions. It is entirely possible that it would actually feel better to look back at this moment if you did participate to an extent, especially if your relationship with your siblings is good. I certainly would not pay a cent for this funeral, but maybe some small conpromise could be made for your siblings' sake. But again, if what you need is to stay totally out, do that. It's your life.", "NTA you have done enough for them when you were forced into a parental role\n\nIts about time they show you some understanding aswell", "NTA and block them all.

Do not engage with them.", "NTA, OP.\n\nPersonally, I think you're taking the high road.

And OP has zero reason to have anything in writing....you can't force anyone to pay for a funeral they didn't plan. He should refuse to discuss this with his siblings and cut them off if they don't drop it. I feel horrible for him that his own siblings don't seem to care, believe or understand what his mom put him through.", "I will be in a similar situation soon that is almost as severe as OP\u2019s. My dad made life MISERABLE and it was clear he has never liked me. My sister though can do no wrong. Dad has had terrible health and never fully recovered from his last two hospital stays. I\u2019ll be shocked if he makes it 6 months. Like OP, I know there will be relief for me. \nSister and I have had many talks. I won\u2019t help plan or pay for the funeral. If she wants help, he is alive and can do that with her now. I want nothing to do with it and no mention I exist as his daughter. \nThat said. My sister and I are close. It sounds like OP and siblings get along. I WILL still be there for my sister. I will let her grieve, help at her place and will likely send a donation to the preferred charity out of respect for my sister. \nI won\u2019t hold my sis responsible for us being treated differently all through life. IMO he also treats her like crap and is manipulative- but it isn\u2019t as severe as with me- and she loves him. I don\u2019t need to know why she loves him or still cares for him\u2026 just that she does. In spite of all his attempts he has not destroyed me and sister\u2019s relation over the years. \nOP doesn\u2019t need to pay or attend. However, if he does get along with the siblings he should try to be there emotionally for them and help where he can. Their relationship is different and it isn\u2019t their fault. \nIt\u2019s a tough situation and I wish it upon no one.", "u/MushroomItchy7180 thank you - you're right. I was not thinking clearly, and I confused myself there based on places that sell various packages. My rationale comes from experience with escaping an abusive family. Often, \"you owe me X amount of money\" is used as a threat; some will pay just to make them go away. I immediately go into cover your ass mode and get everything in writing just in case. I shouldn't assume.", "This reminds me of how horrifically stressed I am that when my abusive father inevitably dies, my sister (who died in 2015) and I will be named in his obit despite the fact I have been NC with him since Jan 2016, when he sent me an itemised list of what he would and wouldn't pay for from my sister's funeral, and told me he didn't come to her wake (we're Irish Catholics, so the wake is a big fucking deal) because my family and friends, including my mother who he abused the worst, didn't make him feel \"welcome\". I am also stressed that his wife (who also emotionally and mentally abused my sister and I from the day we met her, when I was 12 and my sister was 10) would potentially try and come after me to pay for/plan his funeral.   \n\n\nBut, I won't be free of him until he dies, even if I am NC. So as bad as it sounds I will be glad when he goes. The weight will be lifted and if it doesn't mention me at all, all the better.", "That sucks and Im sorry you had to deal with that and have family like that. Why does death bring out the worst in some? As if you aren't dealing with enough.", "u/InterabangSmoose, u/Corgi_Cats_Coffee and u/captainofthenx02 I am so sorry you have to go through that as well. I'm in a similar boat with going NC with abusive family. I was the retirement plan, so any achievements or plans I had were beaten down hard. I finally went NC and it was a huge weight lifted, but there's always a sense of looking over your shoulder for when they're going to barge in and screw up your happiness. I too am fearful of the day when someone will hunt me down to pay a share or try to get me involved in their lives again.", "If I had to venture a guess, survival mode. For some, it's getting away from a bad situation at any cost; for others, it's trying to get every last penny to ensure their comfort (or, conversely, not having to spend a small fortune for a funeral).", "I'm so sorry you're in this too, u/Ok-Procedure6647, I don't know you but I'm proud of you for all you have achieved in spite of abusive family. We're all at this place and that is a huge achievement, and I say this to u/Pure-Device7446 too.   \n\n\nI swear there are enough abusive survivors on this sub to start our own support group."]}
