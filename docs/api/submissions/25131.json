We are basically brothers. In 2020 he met sam (27F) and we would all hangout. Me and Sam weren\u2019t best friends but she made an effort and that\u2019s all that mattered to me. They got married in 2022 and I was the best man. \n\nI am currently single and just enjoying that lifestyle. I started noticing sam making comments after the wedding, basically asking if I thought I\u2019d start wanting to settle down. She also never used to care if we went out by ourselves but now she was always with us. And if we were by ourselves she\u2019d call the whole night kinda ruining the time. \n\nLast week she kept saying she wanted to set me up with her friend Bethany. I didn\u2019t know Bethany but Sam seemed excited so I went in blind other than I knew she was a nurse practitioner which I found impressive so I decided to go. I go on the date and Bethany was beautiful and funny. She was a good time but mentioned she had a kid. Which is not the baggage I like to deal with. Afterwards she brought up a second date I said that she\u2019s the whole package but her kid would be a dealbreaker for me. But if she ever wanted something casual or to grab a drink again I\u2019d be down. \n\nThe next day I stopped over at Charlie\u2019s place and Sam went off on me. Didn\u2019t even give me a chance to walk on the door before she started calling me a bunch of stuff out of the blue. Charlie looked as shocked as I did. I defended myself and said I was a gentleman about it and I had no idea why she was so mad. I didn\u2019t treat her friend poorly at all. Charlie stayed out of it but then Sam said somethings that I never told her about my dating preferences. Something that I only told Charlie. I asked Charlie why he told her things that were between us. And he said that Sam if his wife and he has to tell her things. This enraged me and i basically went off on the both of them. Told Sam that she\u2019s an insecure little girl. That she\u2019s clingy as hell now and just trying to set me up with her friends because she doesn\u2019t trust her husband. And she needs to get help for that and leave me out of it. I told Charlie that me and him aren\u2019t gonna be boys like we were until her learns to get his balls back. I told him I can\u2019t trust him anymore because he\u2019ll just run to his wife and spill my shit to her. And how obviously my life was a topic of discussion for them and I\u2019m not cool with that. And that I was staying away until Sam was gone. More things were said but eventually I left. \n\nMe and Charlie play in a golf league together and I canceled today. He\u2019s reached out a few times and I\u2019ve not responded. I\u2019ve blocked Sam on all social media and she\u2019s tried requesting again. I talked to Charlies sister and she said that her brother is really upset but I\u2019m being an AH about it.

Some things are private, some things are okay. Your preferences arent her business and shes got no business judging what you desire in someone. She is also being a clingy asshole. Newsflash for the people of reddit: just because youre married doesnt mean you need to bring your partner with you every time you go hang out. You can still have a dual social life. Its possible to respect that.", "NTA you got it right on the nose she is insecure and her husband is a fool. Move on and leave them in your past.", "nta.  charlie should have shut her down long ago but she got his nuts in her purse. telling her stuff you told him in confidence is a massive no-no. she is worried that you will show charlie how good the single life is. when sam stirred your shit about not wanting to date a single mom, charlie should have stopped her and not stayed out of it.", "ESH.  You honestly shouldn't have been shocked that Charlie told Sam stuff.  While I don't necessarily agree with the concept of, \"We're married so we have to tell each other EVERYTHING\", it is completely normal for husband's and wives to talk about this stuff.  I think she was completely out of line for blowing up on you when, by the sounds of it, you were perfectly polite to her friend, you just stated that you didn't want to date anyone with kids.  Her friend should have been appreciative of you being so up front, saves her from wasting her time.\n\nI think you went too far in what you said while yelling at them.  And it also sounds like you still need to accept that you are not, and should not be, the most important person in Charlie's life anymore.\n\nEdit: spelling and making my opinion clearer.", "NTA", "NTA - But a lot depends on what info OP shared with Charlie about his dating preferences.  I got the vibe that maybe OP is bi-, possibly gay.  Which is fine, and if that was info he'd shared *in confidence* with Charlie, then I absolutely get that Charlie should not have shared that with his wife - \"there are no secrets between married couples\" doesn't apply to that sort of very private secret.\n\nIt's also possible - and I know I'm reaching here - that if OP is bi-/gay, then that might be why Sam resents his friendship with her husband so much.  OP made the odd remark that Sam is \"just trying to set me up with her friends because she doesn\u2019t trust her husband.\"  Which would fit.\n\nOTOH, if OP had simply confessed to an unremarkable preference for high income single women with no kids who also thought golf was a religion, then, yeah, he would be T A.\n\nMeanwhile, I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt.", "NTA\n\nWay to go Sam! \ud83d\ude02\n\nHusband's and wives talk and share things that are other people's private business.

In her mind, OP needs to settle down, and she will have no more worries that OP will lead hubby astray. \n\nHubby lost his balls when he didn't step up immediately and shut Sam down when she went off on OP.

We all have preferences. What makes yours so secretive that it feels like a breach of trust? Sometimes married couples talk about their friends. Not in a bad way, but it's normal to share opinions and thoughts. She was out of line attacking you, but I don't see big fault in what your friend did. I personally wouldn't blow up a friendship over it, but if you stay open to being set up on dates, let your friends know about your preferences ahead of time, like kids being a dealbreaker.", "NTA. But give him a chance to chat. Maybe you can salvage something, but for sure don't treat him like a best bud anymore. He's more like an occasional acquaintance. And you can help him pick up the pieces if the marriage end. Maybe he will find his balls? Sam can go and kick rocks. You owe her nothing.", "Esh.  Husband's and wives do term each other a lot of stuff.  So that shouldn't have been a shock.  It's also 100% ok to not want them to be hissing about you.  I personally think you went to far, but so did Sam.  If this relationship does mend don't accept any more fix ups.", "I think in regards to Sam you were NTA. She has no right to interfere in your personal life nor berate you for not wanting to date someone who has a kid if that\u2019s not something you feel comfortable with doing. Her verbally attacking you was also extremely uncalled for. However, in regards to Charlie and what he disclosed I\u2019d like to ask exactly how personal/private those dating preferences were (not what they were - obv that\u2019s your business, but like was it super personal and/or sensitive stuff that you only disclosed to a few people?). I agree that if you tell a friend something that\u2019s extremely personal and ask them to stay quiet about it (as long as it\u2019s not hurting or has the potential to hurt yourself or others), then I don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate for them to disclose that to a spouse without permission. However, obviously spouses are going to talk and to give Charlie the benefit of the doubt (especially since you did mention having communicated some other dating preferences to Sam), do you think it\u2019s possible he didn\u2019t understand you wanted that information to be off limits? Regardless, I think that if you do want to have a friendship with Charlie again, you\u2019ll probably need to have a convo about boundaries, especially since his wife used personal information he gave to her against you. If he maintains that in his marital relationship, he does not want to keep any secrets or information hidden if Sam asks, then it\u2019s up to you on if you think you can keep a friendship and just not tell him anything or making the decision to not continue the friendship.", "ESH but OP is much bigger \n\nSam for going of at OP after the date\nOP for completely overreacting. Newsflash: married couples tend to share info so unless OP requested confidentiality, Charlie is within his right to share. Demanding that Charlie drops his wife is completely unreasonable. If that is OP behavior Charlie is better off without such \u201c friend\u201d", "ESH. Assuming things between you and Bethany were as civil as you say, then she had nothing to yell at you about. But your rant was unhinged and childish and does not put you in a good light. It sounds like you're really unhappy about having to share Charlie, which is pretty damn immature.", "ESH. You should expect that a married couple will talk about their friends, including topics like what their dating preferences are. That wouldn\u2019t be considered a \u201cconfidential\u201d topic by most people. If you don\u2019t want your friends to talk about you with their spouses at all, you shouldn\u2019t have any married friends. It\u2019s also natural that once someone gets married they spend less time going out with their friends 1:1 and more time hanging out with other couples.\n\nThat said, Sam handled the set-up situation badly. Personally I think she should have told you in advance that she had a kid, to not waste either of your times if this was a deal breaker. For her to get angry because you weren\u2019t comfortable with that was out of line.\n\nYou then overreacted in turn, by blocking her and refusing to see your friend.", "YTA Not being \u201cboys\u201d til \u201c he learns to get his balls back\u201d tells me all I need to know. Bethany dodged a bullet.", "NTA (maybe slightly E S H) - The thing is\u2026.your relationship with Charlie is going to change now that he\u2019s married and then again if/when he has kids. It\u2019s inevitable. Still, someone told me once that you don\u2019t have to change friends as long as you accept that your friendships will change. But to my vote\u2026You didn\u2019t do anything wrong to Sam\u2019s friend and Sam had no right to go off at you about it. Additionally, Charlie should have stepped in when she started yelling at you. I will say that it does seem a little overdramatic to cut off the friendship with Charlie and to distance yourself from Sam though. You just need to set some boundaries with both of them (one of which cannot be that Sam goes away. Don\u2019t ask your friend choose between you and his wife). It\u2019s very common for spouses to share info on their friends with each other. I learned that fact a long time ago and now tell my friends explicitly when I don\u2019t want something shared with their SOs. I would give Charlie and Sam a chance to apologize and go from there. You\u2019ve been friends way too long to end it over this incident.", "I agree with Charlie's sister.  YTA\n\nHe's married.  You've got to expect him to share stuff with his wife.  His wife, however, needs to respect the friendship and to keep confidential the things that you and Charlie have shared.  You went way out the line with your unfounded assumptions about Sam (clingy? really) and Charlie (get his balls back? really).  They're a married couple. Couples openly talk about stuff. Grow up and get over it. \n\n\\[full disclosure: I'm happily divorced.\\]", "ESH. Sam for going off on you, Charlie for thinking that what you've told him in confidence is an open book for his wife to read at will, and you for fully expecting Charlie to choose you over his wife. All 3 of you need to grow up already.", "ESH\u2026about 60% Sam/40% you.  \n\nI\u2019m not a fan of the whole tell your spouse everything club.  That just ignores a right to privacy that we ought to be able to expect.  Yes, there are things that should not be kept from your partner, but there are things that aren\u2019t any of their business. \n\nThat said, what Charlie did share with his wife wasn\u2019t all that egregious.  If his wife was going to suggest someone to set you up with, it\u2019s pretty reasonable that he\u2019d tell her that you\u2019d prefer certain things\u2026so that she didn\u2019t set you up with someone you\u2019d never go for.  \n\nThis whole thing went off the rails pretty fast.  \n\nYou get part of the AH vote for overreacting to that part of this conversation.  It became your excuse to go off on both of them for how the relationship changed after Charlie got married.  It reads like you want the old dynamic back.  Understandable, but it was never going to be the way it was.  \n\nSam gets a greater part of the AH vote because she went ballistic simply because you don\u2019t want to date someone with a child.  She doesn\u2019t get a say in what your preferences are.  So she was definitely out of line.  And yes, it does appear that she\u2019s insecure about her husband hanging with his single friend and being clingy and manipulative.  That\u2019s something she needs to get a handle on.\n\nAnd while you\u2019re entitled to what you think about their relationship and to be bothered at the changes, unless you\u2019ve had a conversation with Charlie about it, then you shoulder some of the blame for not setting up some guard rails.  About the only person who doesn\u2019t suck here is Charlie.  We have no idea what he\u2019s actually telling his wife, if he\u2019s actually telling her all the private details of your life\u2026that\u2019s an assumption on your part based on a single aspect - your dating preferences.  He got caught up in this power play between you and his wife\u2026who both went ballistic on him.  \n\nNow you\u2019ve set a condition on staying his friend that he\u2019s unlikely to meet.  You\u2019ve told him he has to dump his wife if he wants to keep you as a friend.  There were better ways to set boundaries surrounding your friendship but the nuclear option is just going to mean you\u2019re minus one best friend.", "I have mixed feelings. Sam was out of bounds but I don't think your response was ideal either. \n\nI commiserate over friends sharing personal information.  I stopped telling a former good friend anything really personal because i despised him and didn't want him having details about me. It's all well and good to share your own life with your partner,  but *I* didn't marry him and have no intention of sharing my life with him.", "YTA\n\nYou come off as jealous that your friend spends more time with his wife than he does with you.\n\nHe clearly loves and respects his wife and is close to her. Many people in relationships are very open with each other and tell them everything. To get angry at him for telling his wife about the things in his life is extremely short sighted and immature of you.\n\nShe is probably uncomfortable when her husband goes out with you because you've made it clear that you dislike her.\n\nYou need to understand that your friend is married to her. She is his family. Not some overly clingy booty call. You need to grow up.\n\nAlso, it seems Sam heard about how your date went from her friend. Based on her reaction, perhaps her friend didn\u2019t find you as gentlemanly as you describe yourself to be.", "Info: did you ever indicate to Charlie that what you told him was private and you'd prefer he didn't tell anyone else? If so, I think you are justified, if not I think you overreacted in regards to Charlie. Either way you should consider if you really want to throw away your friendship like that without at least talking about it once.", "If you tell me a secret and tell me not to tell anyone, I\u2019m telling my wife.", "YTA\n\nshe tried to set you up with a great girl and you\u2019re pissed??? the older you get, the more you\u2019re going to meet women with \u201cbaggage\u201d. it sounds like you\u2019d rather date an asshole who is childless. if your friend is happy in his marriage, you should be happy for him. relationships change over time, and he\u2019s allowed to prioritize his marriage over your friendship without you giving him a hard time.", "YTA for the part wher you try telling him he can\u2019t talk to Sam about you - he can it\u2019s a marriage. \n\nAlso until Sam is gone is just childish.\n\nThe rest was fine, and if they\u2019re trying to reach out I think you made your point. Now it\u2019s time you act like an adult also.\n\nSucks for Bethany, but I\u2019d Sam knew your preferences then it\u2019s her fault for ignoring them.

It\u2019s a pretty big turn off to hear, \u201cI\u2019m not interested in you, but you\u2019re hot so I\u2019m dtf.\u201d \n\nThe gentlemanly thing to do is saying, \u201cit was nice to meet you, but I\u2019m not interested in moving forward.\u201d To add in the info about why and to add that he wants to fuck, is not a great look.", "Sooo....you're saying that people are not allowed to know right off the bat that they don't want to date someone with children?  You think that they should waste their time, and the other person's time, by continuing to date them even though they know it wont last?  That makes zero sense.  People are allowed to have preferences when they date, and kids are absolutely one of them.", "so you\u2019re saying that before your date, you told sam that kids are a dealbreaker for you and she set you up anyway, or you didn\u2019t mention this even though it is extremely important to you? do you have a long list of dealbreakers?", "First of all, I'm not OP.  Second of all, there is nothing wrong with having a list of deal breakers for relationships.  I certainly do.  I'm not a \"come one, come all, I'll give anyone a try\" kind of person.  I know what type of person I want to date, and I would much rather be single, than settle for someone who won't make me happy just so I don't have to be alone.  I actually enjoy my own company, and I care about myself too much to let that happen.", "It doesn\u2019t sound like he at all had a problem with the fact that the woman wound up having a kid. That he enjoyed himself but was a grown up and told her he\u2019s not interested in a relationship that is anything more than casual because she has a kid. It was the wife that started being a dick and flinging his preferences in his face. \n\nDo you not have any dealbreakers. Show up on a date and your dates fresh from a bukake set and you\u2019re still down?", "so if you were OP, would you have told sam your preferences/dealbreakers beforehand?", "Probably.  But the argument could also be made that Sam should have told OP that her friend had kids before she set them up.  That's such an important factor in everyone's lives, that it was shortsighted of Sam to not even mention it beforehand.  If I was setting someone up, that would be one of the first things out of my mouth about them.  Kids are not in the same category as appearance or finances.  They are a whole step above both of those things.", "Personally I probably wouldn\u2019t have, if I was single I would just go on the date to see if I have fun and figure things out for myself. Like op did.", "appearance and finance are definitely major factors for women. \n\ni would agree that sam could have told op about her having a kid, but who knows if she intentionally hid it, or thought that blind blind would have worked out better for both of them in terms of authenticity.", ">appearance and finance are definitely major factors for women.\n\nAbsolutely, and actually they are important for most people, not just women.  I just meant that kids are sooo important that they are above even the other two.\n\nAnd as to your second point, you're right, we don't know.  Which kind of solidifies my point that the blame shouldn't necessarily be put solely on OP for this.  Either way, Sam handled this poorly, either by not being up front at the beginning on purpose, or by blowing up at OP when he made his preferences known.  \n\n(OP is definitely to blame for part of this situation too, I'm just not sure that this is that part)."]}
