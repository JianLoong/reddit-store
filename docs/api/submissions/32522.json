Your gf is right that it might blow back on you, but friends tell friends difficult things. Could you imagine how devastated you would be if you were raising a child and then found out that not only were they not yours, but your friends knew.\n\nPlease tell your friend before the baby arrives, so he can get a dna test before signing the certificate. Do not give his gf a heads up that you are going to tell him- just tell him.", "Tell him.  He has a right to know. \n\nIt would be a little more complex if the kid was 10 and your mate had a close bond with them.  As things stand, it is a just tell in my opinion.\n\nNTA tell him today", "YWNBTA. Tell him. Tell him so he can take a DNA test and not ending up raising or paying for a child who isn't his. He is your friend. Your girlfriend and his girlfriend are not that close. You could tell him, exactly like you wrote here. That your girlfriend overheard his girlfriend talk about this and she mentiont that the baby might not be his. You don't know if it is truth - as it is rumors around a few corners but you just wanted to give him a heads up.", "Oh man that sounds like a tough situation.\n\nI think you should tell him. A woman not telling her partner the kid might not be his is such a savage thing and whenever it happens it reinforces negative discrimitive stereotypes about women. Sometimes this happens and it can destroy peoples lifes and families. This is extra hard for you because you might loose your relationship. Maybe you should talk to your partner, maybe you can convince her of how wrong all this is and together you might be able to convince your friends partner to tell him herself.\n\nI wish you the best of luck in this difficult situation.", "NTA. You owe it to a good friend to let them know that you heard a rumor of potential other \"activity\" while they were on a break, so if they have any concerns about paternity they might want to ask their gf and check into it.", "Well shit.\n\nYou need to tell him - even IF it means your GFs friendship with Emma is over.\n\nAlert your GF to this - and dont let her talk you out of it.\n\nBe prepared for (misplaced maybe) anger from Jack, though...\n\nNTA for telling him...

He deserves to know.", "NTA\n\nLook. Your GF has a point - sometimes, people shoot the messenger. But I guarantee that you will always regret it if you don't tell your friend. If you stay quiet, you are enabling his partners choices. True friends always tell the truth, even when it hurts, even when it might end your friendship. But at least he'll have the truth and be able to make informed decisions about his future.", "You should tell him. I\u2019d be devastated to find out such serious news, only to find out everyone else knew before me and nobody felt like I needed to know. You obviously need to approach it tactfully though", "NTA, but I would tell your girlfriend to let Emma know that you are aware of the situation. Give Emma the chance tell him herself as it would be better coming from her. You then give her a deadline and follow it through. \n\nPlease remember, while she has done the wrong thing and has to face the consequences, she is pregnant. Giving her no \"heads up\" that you are about to drop this grenade and having Jack go at her without warning, will not be good for her stress and ultimately the health of the baby, which is the most important thing.", "NTA\n\nBecoming a parent is a life-changing event. If you truly care about your friend, you'll accept that he may end your friendship for revealing what his GF confided in yours. He needs the information, however, to enable him to make some timely, and very critical decisions. You can tell him up-front that you hope telling him something won't cost you your friendship with him, but that the stakes are too high for him if you do not. When/if he gets angry with you, he'll at least go away remembering that you were worried more for his wellbeing than the loss you might suffer. If you were in his shoes you'd clearly want him to care enough to do what is right by you, even if he suffered.", "NTA in general, but you should give Emma the opportunity to tell him first.  Give her a deadline and then if she doesn't tell him, you tell him.  Yeah, there's going to be blowback, but you have to get to the end point, which is a DNA test.", "You need to tell him, before he signs the birth certificate. If it IS his and he wants to work through the cheating, that\u2019s up to them. If it isn\u2019t, don\u2019t let him end up on the hook for a kid that isn\u2019t his for the next 18 years\u2026\n\nBe prepared for him not to believe you/wife to say you\u2019re lying.

Either way, I think it\u2019s your duty as his friend to tell him.\n\nYWNBTA", "There will obviously be blowback if you tell him. For one, Emma will no longer want to be friends with your gf, and will probably not want Jack to have anymore contact with you if he decides to stay with her.\n\nI don't think you telling him would be wrong, you just have to be ready for any blowback and the possible end of your friendship. The fact that you now know this, really means you are in a no win situation. He might be thankful you told him, but he also might not want to believe this and hate you for telling him. But ultimately I would have to tell him", "NTA\n\nHonesty is the best policy.\n\nI would want to be told in this situation. He can ten decide how to proceed. paternity tests etc.", "NTA - you 100% need to tell your bro!   \n\nTaken him out somewhere quiet. Let him know you heard a rumor and you are concerned. Man to man- you need to get a paternity test.   \n\nHe could end up raising some other man's child. Plus- his GF is highly likely to cheat\n  \n\nAnd it's not about her sleeping with someone else. It is about the next 18 + years of this dudes life. Even if he doesn't stick with this girl long term... he will be raising a child that is not his!  Or potentially is not his.  \n\nIf the roles were reversed- I would never forgive you for not saying something.", "NTA.\n\nAbsolutely NTA. It's your duty as a friend to inform your buddy.

Only shows that they still need a DNA test."]}
