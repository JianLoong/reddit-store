She eventually ended up alienating all of our friends, and I ended up siding with her and prioritizing her after an incident that caused her to blow up.  We then spent almost all of our time together, since we had no one else to hang out with.\n\nThis went on for a couple years.  Things were rough money-wise, and I was getting severely depressed.  I toyed with the idea of not making a turn on the way home and just running into that big oak tree at 60-70mph.  Figured the insurance money might help her start over.\n\nI didn't do it because I started making a new friend at work.  Even brought her home, because I figured she was someone my wife could be friends with.  They did hit it off pretty well.  Then I started to notice just how not miserable I was when I was hanging out with this new friend, and I realized I was coming to like her as more than a friend.\n\nI told my wife.  She did a lot of yelling and screaming and throwing of coffee cups at me.  Then the threatening to hurt herself.  We tried counseling and limped along for another 6 months.  She started trying to win me back with sex, which had been distinctly lacking (2-3 times per year).  I just wasn't interested anymore.\n\n When I announced on FB that the ex and I were splitting, ALL of the friends she alienated came out of the woodwork within hours to offer me their support and ask me to come hang out.  One of them even called, half-drunk, from France to tell me I had his full support.\n\nNow it's 10 years later.  I'm back to playing D&D and related games with my friends, and have added more friends to our group.  The \"new friend\" and I are getting married in September and the ex-wife still lives with her mother and an overabundance of cats. Though my fianc\u00e9e and I have a significant (16 year) age gap, both our families are fully accepting and very excited to see us get hitched.  My mother has commented that she's a much better match for me than the ex.\n\nCould the ex and I have made it work if we'd maintained outside friendships and hobbies?  Maybe.  Did being together constantly lead to our failure?  Not entirely, but I'm sure it played a huge role in it.", "YTA for believing that watching tv is solving anything. Your wife needs to engage with you as her husband, and she needs to seek professional help to work through her feelings.\n\nPunishing you for her lack of social awareness, ten years ago, is ridiculous and unfair.\n\nShe is manipulating you. \n\nIf she wants to abandon these friendships over something that worked itself out years ago, she can do that. It's childish, and it would only hurt her, but she can make that choice. \n\nShe can't continue to give you the cold shoulder, and she can't expect you to abandon these meaningful relationships as some misguided show of relationship solidarity.\n\nStop canceling plans with your friends and stop catering to her temper tantrum.\n\nYou deserve more and better than this.

Your want to be there for your wife is something anyone would do. You've tried talking to her in-depth, apologising to her, etc. Just letting her be, letting her work things out while still being there for her is most certainly one of the best things you could do. If you believe this is the best way to be there for her during a difficult time, then you of course have every right to do so, despite plans with friends.\n\nOn that subject, I cannot fathom why your friends would call you manipulative for cancelling plans with them, or refusing to hang out with them. From what you've said, they seem to be the assholes in this scenario. You commented that you don't feel safe telling them about this just yet, even though they're involved in both the issue and with you and your wife in general. Your wife deserves as much time as she needs to recover, so I understand not wanting to talk to these friends about it. Just make sure that your friends won't hurt her or you accidentally, that they're trustworthy enough to, eventually, apologise/talk about it as well.\n\nI hope your wife is able to recover and be in a better place than ever before, and that you are able to do the same and grow from this situation. Good luck!\n\nEDIT: To clarify, you obviously do not owe any of your friends your time nor an explanation right now, and I have no right to tell you to do otherwise. I feel so bad for your wife, and I only wish you guys the best moving forward.\n\nEDIT #2: Also, do be sure to take care of yourself, too!

Being told that your friends and your current spouse didn't like you at first *by your (ex) bully* is awful, especially when it seems like she has other issues that may make her more vulnerable.\n\nI understand where you're coming from: she's not talking to her spouse, nor her friends. This could seem manipulative if she's doing it to gain something (in this case, attention from her spouse). But isolating herself from others, especially since she has a history of being socially awkward and shy, seems to just be her natural response.

At this rate, I'm gonna be blunt (and I don't want it to sound like I'm blaming *you*, because I'm not) - I will be surprised if the relationship survives. You may not feel the same way now, that you used to - but *how* does she let go of the fact that everyone was lying to her, and hating her behind her back, for so long? How does she move on from that and go back to pretending everything is fine?\n\nI just don't see how you go from \"she will not even speak to me\" back to \"everything is fine\". I think you're out of your depth, and if you try to fix this by yourself it is probably over."]}
