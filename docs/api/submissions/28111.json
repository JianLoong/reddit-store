{"id": 28111, "submission_id": "16yjjml", "title": "UPDATE: AITA for telling our mutual friends the real reason behind a cat adoption?", "selftext": "I received some messages asking for an update on the tiny void baby I adopted a year and a half ago. \n\nUnfortunately for me, the fall out of telling people the actual reason eventually led to myself and my ex splitting. Fortunately, I think it was by far the best outcome. \n\nI ended up naming her Freja, and she is still the light of my life. For the last year and a half, we've battled hard to get her healthy. She's had her shoulder and jaw realigned, 6 teeth removed due to extreme dental issues, and we've finally managed to get her ear infections under control after 9 rounds of medication and a surgical cleaning. I spent around 5k getting these issues fixed, and I would do it all again in a heartbeat. \n\nShe has also gone from being extremely underweight (2.6lbs) to a healthy 7.7lbs. She is my baby, whole world, and it's hard imagine what my life would be like without her. \n\nPreviously she would only eat the worst food you could buy, we've managed to get her to eat premium grade wet and dry food, as well as transition onto eating some real food (fish, chicken). She plays now, loves anything that has feathers, and is always extremely grateful for any new thing she is given, be it a small toy or a new cat stand. \n\nShe has 2 sisters now, and 2 dog brothers who she loves to terrorise. She has become a \"the sky is awake, so I'm awake, so GET UP!\" child, no sleep ins allowed. She is my teddy bear and sleeps in a king size bed every night!", "created_utc": 1696311023, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16yjjml/update_aita_for_telling_our_mutual_friends_the/", "score": 1216, "replies": ["Paying void tax: https://imgur.com/a/FPy77HI", "Original post here: https://reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/smTQHRAKF9\n\nGlad to hear this one has a happy ending and Freja has a loving home!", "I'm so happy for you and for Freja.

I can definitely say she has given me many blessings!", "Can confirm have my own void & promptly at 5:30 this morning the sun started shining in the window and he was in my face head butting me to get up and feed him. He at least understands when I saw 10 more minutes, he will lay down beside me after the 3rd \"10 more minutes\" I start getting paws to the face nudging me to wake up.", "So glad to hear the happy ending! I adopted a cat who came from a hoarding situation, and she was similar, so happy to receive anything, and LOVED the good food she got. She had been terribly overweight, I guess on lousy food, and slimmed way down once she was eating decent food. But she'll still eat anything I give her, unlike my other cat that I've had since she was a tiny kitten.

Her blood tests were flagging triple infection markers and she was still so tiny, but I had no choice as her ears and teeth were so bad that she couldn't eat. Once we got those 6 teeth removed, she started doing a lot better. \n\nThe jaw and shoulder reset was a solid 3k, but being an ex-vet nurse I brought her home immediately so she didn't have to spend the night away. \n\nShes such a cool cat, we take her 4x4 driving, out for dinner, on walks even, she loves to sit on the centre console of the car and judge sh--ty drivers haha", "I found it :).

One of my void kitties is all about being as high up as he can, so he climbs everywhere. Has only just started to be bold enough to try to be outdoors.

It's the 3rd kitty who has the health issues, has either fiv or feline leukemia (I can't remember which one the vet has tested her for multiple times, but she's tested positive for it all but once. She's 12 years old and had her since she was 5 months old, living her absolute best life. They all get spoiled, tons of treats and toys, the best dry and wet food, best litter, automated litter boxes, their own food dishes, lots of cat trees, condos, cat beds, track balls, scratch pads... pretty sure I've spent more on one of them per month than I have on anything for myself in a month, just to ensure they're happy and healthy.
