{"id": 28111, "submission_id": "16yjjml", "title": "UPDATE: AITA for telling our mutual friends the real reason behind a cat adoption?", "selftext": "I received some messages asking for an update on the tiny void baby I adopted a year and a half ago. \n\nUnfortunately for me, the fall out of telling people the actual reason eventually led to myself and my ex splitting. Fortunately, I think it was by far the best outcome. \n\nI ended up naming her Freja, and she is still the light of my life. For the last year and a half, we've battled hard to get her healthy. She's had her shoulder and jaw realigned, 6 teeth removed due to extreme dental issues, and we've finally managed to get her ear infections under control after 9 rounds of medication and a surgical cleaning. I spent around 5k getting these issues fixed, and I would do it all again in a heartbeat. \n\nShe has also gone from being extremely underweight (2.6lbs) to a healthy 7.7lbs. She is my baby, whole world, and it's hard imagine what my life would be like without her. \n\nPreviously she would only eat the worst food you could buy, we've managed to get her to eat premium grade wet and dry food, as well as transition onto eating some real food (fish, chicken). She plays now, loves anything that has feathers, and is always extremely grateful for any new thing she is given, be it a small toy or a new cat stand. \n\nShe has 2 sisters now, and 2 dog brothers who she loves to terrorise. She has become a \"the sky is awake, so I'm awake, so GET UP!\" child, no sleep ins allowed. She is my teddy bear and sleeps in a king size bed every night!", "created_utc": 1696311023, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16yjjml/update_aita_for_telling_our_mutual_friends_the/", "score": 923, "replies": ["Paying void tax: https://imgur.com/a/FPy77HI", "Original post here: https://reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/smTQHRAKF9\n\nGlad to hear this one has a happy ending and Freja has a loving home!", "I'm so happy for you and for Freja.

Yay for you and Freya and your big, little fur family! You are an excellent momma.", "I\u2019m so glad she is with you, and doing so wonderfully.

The kid ended up with her parents I believe! \n\nShes currently cheeking at the birds, getting told off by my wife \ud83e\udd23", "Oh so, new better partner plus cool cats? Winning.", "My new partner is 25/10, hence why I locked her down with a ring", "You did a cat well and cat karma repaid you fully! You deserve all that is good", "Kitty baby inspired a life of wildcare, which is how I met my wife. She had a bird downed in her yard and I was the closest wildlife carer available. I can definitely say she has given me many blessings!", "Can confirm have my own void & promptly at 5:30 this morning the sun started shining in the window and he was in my face head butting me to get up and feed him. He at least understands when I saw 10 more minutes, he will lay down beside me after the 3rd \"10 more minutes\" I start getting paws to the face nudging me to wake up.", "So glad to hear the happy ending! I adopted a cat who came from a hoarding situation, and she was similar, so happy to receive anything, and LOVED the good food she got. She had been terribly overweight, I guess on lousy food, and slimmed way down once she was eating decent food. But she'll still eat anything I give her, unlike my other cat that I've had since she was a tiny kitten. Who does the cat thing of loving a food until she decides she hates it and never wants to see it again and who the hell am I feeding her that dreck (that she happily ate last week.)", "Thank you for rescuing that precious precious little baby.  I can\u2019t understand how anyone can claim to live animals and then neglect them like that.", "You are an awesome being, thank you.", "Excuse me, but it's been over a year -   I believe you owe us new cat tax.

You\u2019re a great person. Give kitty lots of love!", "Naming your black cat after the Nordic goddess of magic who rode into battle on a chariot pulled by cats seems lile an excellent omen!!", "I am so pleased to see this update! Your cat needed the love that you have. She is clearly thriving!\n\nIf you have any tips or tricks for getting a picky cat to transition to a better quality of cat food, please share! I own a pet supply store and that is information that I could use.", "UGH and she's a sweet little black cat I love black cats so muuuuch. Congratulations on the wonderful little furry companion!", "i\u2019m not crying, i just have dust in my eye \ud83e\udd79\ud83e\udd79\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d", "Beautiful! Congratulations :)", "Such a little sweetheart! \ud83d\ude3b The void in my life is 16 pounds of muscle.  I\u2019m glad to hear she is doing better. My last cat ( that my x-husband hated) lived 13.5 years and my marriage lasted 7.5 years.", "Oh what a precious void bean cuddling her toy", "Mine likes to wait until I'm sure he like the food/brand and buy the 40lb. bag - guess what he doesn't like anymore? Luckily, my sister's cats aren't so picky - they will eat anything and everything so they are usually the beneficiaries of my cat's culinary whims.", "I\u2019ve always called that shape being a prawn", "ihope the owner OD'd and not the child", "So glad to see she's doing great!", "Did she pass from the OD?", "Aw I'm glad you got a happy ending as well"]}
