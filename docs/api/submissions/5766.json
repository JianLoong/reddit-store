He has a bf Drake (16M) who is still closeted. They were originally supposed to come out together last year , but while Martin did Drake chickened out. Now I get it we live in a not to big town  in Mississippi ,his home life isn't the greatest or most progressive to put it mildly , and he wants to be a pro wrestler.  Martin understood that too and he's never made any attempt to push Drake to come out even though I know he hates being a secret.\n\nThe main problem is that when they're teammates make homophobic remarks or jokes especially at Martin's expense after he came out  Drake joins in. When they're teammates started distancing themselves from Martin  ,Drake joined in. When people tried to bully Martin ;Drake joined in while also sneaking around with Martin hanging out at our house  secretly dating the boy he acts like he can't be to friendly with around their teammates.  Me and our brother Zack (17M) have wanted to do something about it ,but Martin begged us not too and to just let him deal with it. He'd usually just laugh it off or make light of it even though we could tell it hurt him alot.\n\nLast Friday Martin came home way more upset then I'd ever seen him ,crying and upset. He wouldn't talk to me or our parents and just stayed in his room all weekend.  Zack told us what happened ,that apparently Martin' and Drake's teammates were pestering Drake about how he used to be so close to the gay kid. Drake decided to tell them that they stopped being friends when he found out the \"f@@g@t\" had a crush on him and tried to hit on him. He also started revealing a bunch of embarrassing secrets about Martin like how he wet the bed till he was 12. That obviously got back around to Martin and the shit storm ensued.\n\nDrake tried to stop by Monday to apologize and got me at the door.  Martin was upstairs in his room so I know he couldn't hear me and I just got so pissed that I snapped at Drake. I told Drake that he was a cowardly pos. That he didn't have to come out ,but he didn't get to treat my brother like shit and if thats the way he'd act that he should just leave my brother alone. I told him to never come over or try to talk to Martin again.  He looked really sad ,just said he was sorry and left. Martin was upset all week because he hadn't heard anything from Drake. Martin apparently went over to Drake's house Friday and found out what I said. He came home upset about what I did and that I had no right. I countered that Drake treats him like shit and that he shouldn't have to deal with that. He yelled at me that I don't really know how bad Drake has I at home and I shoulda just butted out.

He doesn\u2019t need to come out. He can do that on his own terms and when he\u2019s ready. But just because he\u2019s closeted gives him no right to bully your brother like that.", "NTA. Drake is \u2026 I feel sorry for your brother.", "NTA:\n\n I hate mob mentality so much, I'm assuming that maybe Drake's family might be homophobic as well. So he tried to stay out of the cross hair, but this caused his boyfriend your brother to get caught in the middle. I've seen so many times where a kid from an abusive family will often take the side of the bullies because they are afraid of what's happening to that kid happening to them. Drake is a coward, and he shouldn't have said the things he did. If he really wanted to apologize to your brother he should come out to all of them.", "NTA, hopefully your brother understands how you were helping him one day.\n\n\nIn the meantime, I think you should try to help your brother find a group of LGBT people. See if there is any drag shows in the city that are for all ages, or groups for LGBT kids. It\u2019s important for him to experience people being out and proud and happy.", "NTA -- I'm assuming this is the first relationship for both of them, or at least one of few. The relationship is unhealthy, and neither Drake nor Martin recognize that yet. So many LGBTQ people believe they must settle for toxic, abusive (yes, abusive) relationships because our identities can be isolating. Drake was showing up after the fact to gaslight your brother after leveraging Martin's vulnerability, tearing him down, and further isolating him. Yes, Drake is entitled to come to terms with his sexuality on his own timeline, but you were NTA for naming the unhealthy, damaging impact of his actions. \n\nHopefully, your brother comes to understand this over time. And thank you for being a loving, caring, supportive brother. We need more people like you in this world.", "NTA\n\nThe biggest AHs are the teammates that make these comments.\nCan your family speak to his coach about this as it's not OK.", "I was going to call you an AH because you don\u2019t get to decide when someone comes out, but then I read what he did to your brother and I am enraged. NTA. He doesn\u2019t have to come out, but to be a coward and make shit up about your brother instead of saying knock it off? He deserved what you did. Hopefully your brother will see that he deserves better than this guy.", "NTA. Honestly\u2026 I can\u2019t help but think that people like Drake grow up, never come out, end up hating themselves, and then get jobs as politicians and such and make life a living hell for those who did come out because they\u2019re bitter and angry with themselves for never having the courage.\n\nIt\u2019s a shitty situation and you\u2019re just trying to protect your brother and remind him that he deserves better, no matter what someone\u2019s situation at home is. Hurt people hurt people and you\u2019re trying to break that cycle.", "ESH except your brother. It's not your place to withhold information like that. Your brother knows more about what's going on with Drake than you do and it might well be dangerous for him to come out. Drake is colluding with homophobic behaviour to deflect suspicion. It's not a good way to deal with the situation and the whole team need to sort themselves out. It's great that you want to look out for your brother but do that by supporting him, not attacking someone else and lying. If he's in danger at home because of his sexuality, scared of what the team might say if they knew, ashamed of how he treated your brother, and then berated by you, he's at higher risk of self-harm and taking his own life. Your brother is lucky to have a caring and supportive family but Drake isn't in the same position.", "ESH\n1. Brother sucks for yelling at OP for defending him.\n2. OP sucks for engaging in the conflict when brother asked her not too.\n3. Boyfriend sucks for enabling everything happening to his partner just to save his own skin.\n4.

I can't imagine Drake's fears, but he's not behaving well at all.\n\nAnd personally, I think the coach and school should be made aware of how their wrestling team is behaving.", "NTA. It doesn't matter how bad Drake has it at home. He told personal things about Martin and is billing him in public.", "I mean this is more or less the plot of Heartstopper on Netflix.  Your brother is analogous to Charlie and his current bf to Ben. Maybe get him to watch it and it might be a way to show him that Drake is being selfish and doesn't deserve him.\n\nNTA.", "YTA for not telling your brother what you did.\n\nAbsolutely, 100% agree that Drake needed a verbal shake and set down. **However,** you shouldn't have let Martin think he was being ignored by his boyfriend for a week when you knew he was upset over it.\n\nDid you not expect Martin to find out what happened? He probably walked away from that conversation feeling foolish, and mad at the wrong person. If he knew Drake had been told to stay away he could have spoken to him again on his terms.", "NTA", "Agreed. It\u2019s the kind of stuff you read about or see in movies. To hear that people actually react like that is disgusting (closeted partner\u2019s actions).
