Martin understood that too and he's never made any attempt to push Drake to come out even though I know he hates being a secret.\n\nThe main problem is that when they're teammates make homophobic remarks or jokes especially at Martin's expense after he came out  Drake joins in. When they're teammates started distancing themselves from Martin  ,Drake joined in. When people tried to bully Martin ;Drake joined in while also sneaking around with Martin hanging out at our house  secretly dating the boy he acts like he can't be to friendly with around their teammates.  Me and our brother Zack (17M) have wanted to do something about it ,but Martin begged us not too and to just let him deal with it. He'd usually just laugh it off or make light of it even though we could tell it hurt him alot.\n\nLast Friday Martin came home way more upset then I'd ever seen him ,crying and upset. He wouldn't talk to me or our parents and just stayed in his room all weekend.  Zack told us what happened ,that apparently Martin' and Drake's teammates were pestering Drake about how he used to be so close to the gay kid. Drake decided to tell them that they stopped being friends when he found out the \"f@@g@t\" had a crush on him and tried to hit on him. He also started revealing a bunch of embarrassing secrets about Martin like how he wet the bed till he was 12. That obviously got back around to Martin and the shit storm ensued.\n\nDrake tried to stop by Monday to apologize and got me at the door.  Martin was upstairs in his room so I know he couldn't hear me and I just got so pissed that I snapped at Drake. I told Drake that he was a cowardly pos. That he didn't have to come out ,but he didn't get to treat my brother like shit and if thats the way he'd act that he should just leave my brother alone. I told him to never come over or try to talk to Martin again.  He looked really sad ,just said he was sorry and left. Martin was upset all week because he hadn't heard anything from Drake. Martin apparently went over to Drake's house Friday and found out what I said. He came home upset about what I did and that I had no right. I countered that Drake treats him like shit and that he shouldn't have to deal with that. He yelled at me that I don't really know how bad Drake has I at home and I shoulda just butted out.

Your choice is to support Martin when he's sad or hurt by being extra kind. You can have serious talks with him about your feelings around how Drake treats him, and how that make you feel,and discuss your concerns about the abusive overtones that endanger Martin when Drake encourages the bullying. But dumping his bf on his behalf and then not telling him that Drake was there to apologize, which specifically waited for and suffered unnecessarily longer for, hurts him too. And you *want* him to trust you to come talk to about things like this.", "Are your parents supportive of your brother? If he was my child, I would have him talk to a therapist because he\u2019s verging on, if not already in, an abusive relationship. NTA, but if your parents are cool, talk to them.", "NTA please talk to your brother or give him some resources to understand what's happening because at this rate he's gonna end up with thoughts like \"he hits me cause he loves me\" or end up settling for him cause he thinks he can't get any better.", "NTA, but it would have been better if you had told your brother that Drake stopped by and you told him off. Then he wouldn\u2019t torture himself wondering if Drake had rejected him for good. I know it\u2019s really hard to see your brother bullied like this, and in love with such a follower. Please keep reinforcing that he is the brave and strong one, and that love is never anything to be ashamed of, even if he picked a guy who is not someone who he can count on.", "Nta. I understand not coming out because he\u2019s not safe at home but I don\u2019t understand him treating your brother this way.", "You should honestly explain the reason why you snapped.  You hated to see Martin hurt time and time again by Drake who not only didn't stand up for Martin but contributed to the attacks.  You felt you were protecting Martin, supporting him.   You knew, and know even now, that Martin and Drake will be face to face in the future and hoped the things you said would help Drake decide to do the right thing and either tell the truth and fight for his good friend or walk away and do no more damage than he already has.\n\nYou are NTA", "[deleted]", "NTA. Important I say that first because normally I think you shouldn\u2019t be involve yourself in others relationships, but this is abuse and family doesn\u2019t sit by and watch their loved ones be abused. I think you did the right thing and I would\u2019ve probably punched him in the damn face. Let him explain we he has a black eye to people.", "Someone needed to say it and I'm sorry but your brother was in a very unhealthy relationship (it was abusive). Have a heart to heart with your brother about how you and your other brother are worried about how he was treated and to tell him that Drake's behavior is not good at all. Drake was not a good boyfriend, he is a bully, and your brother can do so much better. Drake can stay in the closet for as long as he wants/needs but that doesn't mean he gets to be abusive towards your brother and make him cry on the daily.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA", "Drake redirecting possible homophobic bullying towards your brother is not okay at all! He\u2019s free to keep his sexuality to himself until he feels safe to reveal it, but it\u2019s not okay to put a bigger target on your brother\u2019s back. Martin might be upset now but he\u2019ll appreciate once he\u2019s older that both of you had his back. NTA", "The road to hell is paved with good intentions. It\u2019s unfortunate your brother can\u2019t see what you\u2019re doing is in his favor, but at some point he will look back and be grateful that you did say something. You did a good thing and you are a good brother, thank you for sticking up for him.", "NTA.  You were making effort to protect your family member.", "NTA your brother s experiencing partner abuse and is blaming it on his home life so he can keep emotionally abusing your brother. Where are your parents?", "A couple of things to put to Martin...\n\n1) He's completely correct that you don't know how bad Drake has it at home. However these incidents aren't happening at home, are they? And while Drake may feel the need to take part in the bullying in order to not come under suspicion himself...\n\n2) Why does he seem to be reveling in it and why is he choosing to expose potentially embarrassing secrets in this \"act\" of his?\n\n3) If Drake knows firsthand that being gay can open one up to violence, is he aware how dangerous it could be to suggest to these bigots that Martin is \"chasing\" after straight boys? That could really open Martin up to serious danger - what if Drake's father heard it and decides that Martin needs to be taught a lesson?\n\nThis is not a good situation for Martin at all. And while I feel for Drake's home situation, putting Martin in danger won't resolve his own issues.\n\nNo judgement, as I know that you are just trying to protect your brother. But you also need to give him some autonomy in his relationships. Instead of trying to take control, talk to him about all the reasons why Drake's actions are showing that he is not ready for a relationship.", "While you have no right to say you don't want Drake seeing your brother again, you are NTA. Speaking as a transgender (and very het) woman, one of the first things you learn is that down low men just ain't shit, and part of growing up is learning how to stick up for tbe people you love and leaving behind the people who can't claim you in public. Since it doesn't seem like it's as bad as it could be considering they're both minors and 16yo boys tend to be stupid and want to fit in, but this is a textbook example of abuse, bullying a partner, sharing private things they confided them in, making jokes at partner's expense,  etc. and things like this literally get people killed (gay panic defense is still very much alive regardless of what the law says) and have massive consequences,  legally and otherwise. If Drake has any remorse or care for your brother, then he knows what he needs to do.", "NTA. You come from a well meaning place and I\u2019m glad your brother has you and your other brother for support. GTFO of Mississippi though", "Your defense of your brother is coming from the right place. Everything you said was correct. However, very slight yta for not telling your brother that Drake came by. I think you and your brother need to have a calm heart to heart about what a healthy relationship looks like. Your brother is not responsible for Drake\u2019s home life. He deserves to be treated better. \n\nIt\u2019s a really shitty situation all around. I\u2019d say the most important thing you can do is continue to support your brother, especially publicly if possible.", "Drake is already an abuser. Bullying your partner, routinely putting them down, calling them slurs, and using your relationship to gain embarrassing information about them which you then knowingly reveal to people who will use that information to hurt them IS ABUSE. As far as we know, Drake isn't beating OP's brother (yet), but he is horrifically abusing him.", "NAH. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong, and it\u2019s understandable why your brother is reacting this way. You\u2019re trying to protect your brother from an unhealthy relationship with someone who has literally thrown your brother in front of the bus, and at this point is driving the bus and personally running him over as well. Drake could be \u201csorry,\u201d but that doesn\u2019t doesn\u2019t stop him from repeatedly attempting to hurt your brother to save his own skin. *This is not love or a relationship*.\n\nHowever, your brother is young, this is his first relationship, and more importantly, *he doesn\u2019t have any other options and doesn\u2019t realize high school isn\u2019t forever.* He\u2019s upset for you trying to defend him because if Drake doesn\u2019t work out, he has nobody. So he\u2019d rather be humiliated by someone who doesn\u2019t really love him in order to have some sort of companionship when Drake is willing to hide with him. He\u2019s a kid. He doesn\u2019t have an example of what a healthy relationship looks like yet. Also, where are your parents?\n\nI think his focus should be prioritizing meeting other LGBTQ kids like him well also keeping his head down, and focusing on getting into a good school so he could maybe move north and meet better people. At the moment, he would rather be abused than be alone. Maybe you could show him these comments?", "I think it could be because it's an easy way to find people.  You are right of course.", "Me too.    And all around me were people telling me this was the best time of my life, that for the rest of my life I would look back on this time and wish I could go back.  I wonder if this is why teen suicide rates are so high -   they're in hell and people keep telling them life only gets worse after this.", "Abuse is never \"understandable\", actually.", "I hate those POSes, but I think this might be worse, little snot is in active relationship with the victim while publicly actively joining in on the bullying. But it's ok because he gets beat or yelled at at home... BEING ABUSED IS NOT A LICENCE TO ABUSE OTHERS.\n\nOP NTA, brother might want to read the Chris Crutcher novels though, and find him some books on abused abusers. This kid is making up for his abuse at home by taking it out on your brother PLUS he gets your brother to soothe him. smh", "I totally understand why OP lashed out, even with the last part I would have been \"okay\" if OP had come clean. It was na\u00efve of OP to think the truth would not come out. \n\nIt can be hard to see someone you care about make mistakes, but while you can encourage them and try to advise them in the right direction sometimes you just have to step back and let them make their own mistakes, and try to be there for them to help them pick up the pieces. \n\nIn this situation the brother goes back to Drake, but when bad things happen in the future the brother might be less willing to confide in OP and that in the end can make it harder for brother to get away from Drake.", "Heartstopper does literally the exact opposite. The main moral of the show is that everyone deserves the right to come out in their own time and on their own terms, but that even if you are trying to keep your relationship a secret you still owe your partner respect and kindness, to not be embarrassed to be seen being friendly with them, and to stand up to those in your circle who bully them or otherwise give them a hard time. The first season is basically entirely about how to handle OP\u2019s brother\u2019s situation correctly while maintaining everyone\u2019s privacy and dignity. It even involves a relationship between sports teammates where other members of the team are homophobic. You get one episode of seeing the wrong way (i.e. OP\u2019s situation) and 7 episodes of the right way.", "NTA all the bf had to do was not join in but not only did he betray your brother by telling his bullies his secrets. Difficult home does not give you a free pass to be a bully. If he truly cares about him he would of never said the secrets", "Take your brother out to a bigger city to see what life has for him. He doesn't deserve to think that Drake is the only boy out there, and living in a small town with a small town mindset probably doesn't help expand his oppurtunity.\n\nNTA, and good job. As a younger sibling and a queer person with an ex like Drake, I thank you.", "NTA. If he was my brother the whole school would know the truth", "NAH I understand Martin's pressure and I'm not surprised how he acts, he's young and he has no support anywhere, you want to protect your brother and your brother should look for someone available (going out with people in the closet always brings these problems) so I will say NAH it is a very complex situation and that unfortunately often happens", "NTA. All I had to read is that BF participates in gay slurs. NOPE. Your brother needs to tell him Buh-Bye and find someone worthy of him.", "I don't see your brother understanding any time soon, but you did well in protecting your brother. NTA", "YTA\n\nIn general this seems like a shit situation and I feel sorry for everyone involved, but it seems like Drake went beyond what can be excused by that and it's completely fair you being angry and protective, so I'm not saying YTA for the way you acted towards Drake.\n\nThe only bit that makes YTA is that you didn't tell your brother he'd come round, especially when \"Martin was upset all week because he hadn't heard anything from Drake\". Not telling him, especially at that point, is a lie if omission; your brother is old enough to make his own decisions about this things and by keeping information from him you deny him that opportunity.", "NAH - let me amend that. The teammates are! Then again how many of them are closeted or have terrible home lives?\n\nIt is just a sh\\*t situation. Plus all teenagers everywhere are all AHs, it is the beauty of getting to grow up.\n\nGood for you for standing up for your brother, good for your brother for standing up for his boyfriend. \n\nNone of this will get easier until Drake is out of his house.

You were protecting your brother from a toxic and manipulative \"friend\".", "I'm a lesbian who grew up on the Alabama-Florida border. My family life was incredibly abusive and very dangerous. They were extremely conservative Christians who thought gay people should die. The town I lived in had one school. The students beat the only openly gay kid so bad he had to be life flighted out. \n\nI didn't even really come out to myself for a long time because I was so afraid. I eventually went to a school in the town next over. I was a known Christian. I had gay kids ask me what I thought. I told them it wasn't my place to judge, it was my place to love. Your circumstances don't define you. Your choices do. Character is a cummulation of your tiniest, unseen choices. \n\nYou protected your brother from an abusive partner. Had this been a girlfriend, I suspect you would have reacted the same way. His boyfriend, regardless of sexual orientation, has proven to be a coward of poor character who is also an abuser. LGTBQ people can be abusers/abused too. It should be talked about more. \n\nI'm so proud of you for standing up for him. He is still a child, and at a certain point, safety should override self exploration. Thanks for being a great big brother!\n\nTo your brother:  I want you to know that I have been in your shoes. Life gets better. I just got engaged to my very patient partner of 13 years last month! Please don't give up hope. Know that you will find your place. You deserve someone who loves you and is as loyal and kind and patient with you as you are to them. Also, my best advice to you would be to flee the South as soon as you are able. I'm so much happier and feel much safer in Denver where I live now. It's not you, it's them. There are so many people rooting for you!", "NTA. You're a good and loving brother.\n\nI have some pity for Drake. Hurt people hurt people. Martin could be right; we could have no idea what kind of wretched things he's afraid will happen to him if he's caught out.\n\nBut... your brother deserves someone who, if not able to stand up for him, at least won't take part in tearing him down.", "I assume you probably know\u2026 but just in case\u2026\nLook into PFLAG and Trevor Project if you or your brother just need someone to talk to about anything.", "I had a coworker that would spend our workdays verbally and sometimes physically abusing me because I was a newly out lesbian, then she'd get drunk and call me after work, telling me she loved me, and what she wanted to do to me, and the like, but she \"couldn't\" come out at work, and had to make sure everyone knew she was straight. \n\nShe was fooling no one. \n\nI can't stand the fake ones", "Agreed", "You explained it beautifully that it's so sad to see the actor of main character was forced to come out by the fans of the series itself"]}
