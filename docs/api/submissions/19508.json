My stepsister\u2019s always been jealous because I have nicer stuff. \n\nBoth of us graduated this year. Our graduation ceremony was last Friday and our prom was the Saturday before that. I\u2019ve been living with my aunts for a few months now. They bought me a pretty expensive prom and hosted an after party (which my stepsister was at because my aunts asked me to invite her). They also threw me a graduation party that none of my dad\u2019s family came to even though they were invited. \n\nMy dad hosted a party for both of us today and asked me to stay the weekend. As I expected, the party was completely about her. I was told that it was for both of us. My dad gave a long speech about how proud he is of my stepsister. He mentioned me once but the rest of his speech was completely about her.

You want your dad's love and attention and she wants the nicer things in life that you are getting now.\n\nShe says you have it easier even though you lost your mom... low blow.  I am sorry but she deserved to be called something much worse.  I get it, she is mad and jealous and wants to make you feel bad. You are angry and have enough and stooped to her level. \n\nWhen people push people into a corner and just expect them to take it and are surprised when they come out punching? Really?\n\nAll things considered here... You are a teenager and said something in anger when provoked.  In my book that makes you NTA. \n\nYou might want to fill your aunts in about what happened and let them deal with your dad and stepmom, if you do not want to deal with them.", "NTA. \n\nThe beauty of being 18+ and going off to college is you don't have to associate with them anymore. Love the people who'll love you back--in this case, obviously your aunts. Let dad and his wife+perfect family figure their own shit out.", "NTA, your stepsister and your dad on the otherhand. Usually Im anti gendered insults, but what an entitled petty little arsehole. She literally wanted to tell a girl who lost her mother at birth about how she's had life so easy.\n\nEdited to correct an error", "NTA.  She provoked you, you told her what you thought.    Play stupid games win stupid prizes.   I mean her, not you.   That was crappy of your dad to say it was a party for both of you then focus only on her.    There is a lot going on there, seems like sis is not the only one jealous of you.    Get me?  If it were me, I wouldn\u2019t talk to anyone in that household for a long while.  Enjoy your trip to Europe!", "NTA, stuff happens, you two are same age and will always compete against each other, compare and feel jealous etc. Frankly as parents its totally childish to get in the middle of it. She ain't crying because you called her dumb b\\*tch, she is crying because she is getting this strange feeling that you are getting ahead in life and she is stuck, its something new to her and she is having hard time coping with it. Parents should understand this and stay out of it, I am pretty sure you both will patch it up as life goes on, from your words I can say you both are pretty civil around each other and respect each other.\n\nShe has to learn not to compare herself against you and keep poking it around you, especially when she is a constant reminder how your own father loves her more. Anyway continue on with your life, no need to feel sad about this incident. \n\nI had 2 cousins same age as me, we had a raging cold war among us, its still going on tbh, we had often said mean things to each other when we were teens and it never ends so learn to live with it.", "NTA but it sounds like your step sister is a product of bad parenting and it also sounds like your father and stepmother are Disney villain parents. People like that shouldn't be able to reproduce. What AHs.\n\nI'm really glad you have your Aunties.", "NTA, she is envious of your access to financial support but she intentionally makes sure to keep your bio dad\u2019s attention on her, your sperm donor is the biggest AH here, she exacerbates that, and your lashing out was provoked.", "NTA. Tell them \u201cher graduation party?! I thought it was for the two of us?\u201d  Honestly try and have a conversation with them about everything they\u2019ve done to you or not done as it were. Tell them you\u2019ve had enough of their favoritism.", "INFO: You talk a lot about how your dad and stepmom treated you and you mention your stepsister feeling jealous of you, but how did she TREAT you?", " NTA\nYour SS initiated a heavy, emotional conversation then cried when you responded with your take on things.", "NTA. Go back to your loving aunts and live your best life! Leave the negativity behind and press on to a positive future!", "NTA you haven't \"always had it easier\", you spent the last 15 years being treated like an unwanted extra in your dad's new family, your stepsister was treated as your dad's favourite while he forgot about you. And he's STILL doing that. To your stepsister, having a few months of enjoying living with 'rich' family members who are happy to treat you and fund your education is, \"always having things easy\". She completely missed that you had to suffer before this, while as you said, she got to enjoy three parents who love her for her entire childhood. You were harsh, but I don't think your comment was wrong.   \n\n\nI think it would be worth sitting down and writing your dad a letter, explain how you feel and how you were treated. He may not get it, and it may not change anything, but it might help you to get it out there. I would also consider sending the same letter to any of his family who try to call you out about this situation.", "NTA. This sounds like a complicated situation and your father has a lot to answer for", "NTA. Ignore all of them", "ESH. \n\nCards on the table here: I do think you need to acknowledge that your aunts\u2019 financial position has made your life significantly easier than your stepsister\u2019s in a lot of ways. Sorry, but it has. You have access to the kinds of opportunities (and luxuries!) that she could never dream of. When you leave college, you will have no debt. That\u2019s a pretty exceptional thing, especially in the US. I grew up a lot like you, and it\u2019s only after I went away to school that I really understood all of the stuff that I had been sheltered from. So I\u2019m sympathetic to your stepsister\u2019s position, and based on some of her complaints I\u2019m inclined to think that you do flaunt it, a little bit (the Europe trip being one example, the whole thing feels kind of exclusionary.) Calling her a bitch was out of line, and feels disproportionate to the situation. \n\nThat said, it sounds like your stepsister is aware of your bad family dynamic and manipulates it for her own gain. You guys are in a competition, and that\u2019s her weapon of choice. She monopolizes your father\u2019s attention because she feels like it\u2019s the one thing she can actually have that you don\u2019t. \n\nBut the biggest assholes by far are your father and stepmother, who are ineffective and cowardly parents. They\u2019re at the heart of all of this shit, and they\u2019ve managed to turn two girls who should theoretically have everything in common against one another. That\u2019s a real shame.", "NTA. While calling her a bitch was not the best choice of words, I don't get the everyone sucks votes. How is losing one's mother at 3 and the  being treated like the help in dad's new fabulous family was even remotely acceptable? Like a minor being raised by the aunt and her wife cause dad checked  out was any fun or fair? Fuck that.\n\n I had a friend in a similar position, her godmother died whe  she was 6  dad checkout out and went looking for a new mom and dumped the lid with grandma. She got lovely things, but she is slightly fucked up. Her half sister is doing well, but a bit of a bitch to say the least. Understandably, but all extremely complex.  \n\nI strongly suspect  that OP would have gotten help from the aunt even if mom had been alive, but defs aunt is compensating for you know mom being dead. \nAnd OP getting in a good uni is not just about money, also her academic achievements. Feel bad step sis did not apply or try to get financial help, but that's her choice.", "ESH. I just can\u2019t with how much everyone sucks. I can\u2019t believe you two were put in this situation. I\u2019m so sorry your mom died so young and you were treated so poorly. My god this sounds like Cinderella. I get why your stepsister is jealous and I also get why you are so hurt by how your dad kicked you to the curb. I\u2019m just sorry for you guys, I hope you two work it out because sisters can be an amazing blessing. \n\nAlso, when I say ESH, I think what I mean is - your dad sucks. Royally.", "Can I ask... Where is her dad? We're they divorced or did he die?\n\nWhile I am saying ESH, please understand that she doesn't have the same advantages as you and that's hard to handle at any age, especially for someone so young.  I mean, she's watching you go off with your mutual friend group on vacation and she has to stay home.\nShe watches you get all the advantages. That must hurt. She's not making light of you losing your mother when she says things have been easier for you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It might be worth talking to your aunts to find out if there's any bad blood between them and your father that you don't know about, perhaps related to your mother's death (or maybe you already know what this grudge is). In my personal experience, these kinds of weird, intrafamilial grudges/conflicts always start with some event that happened in the past that no one talks about. For example, maybe your dad asked your aunts for money when your mother died and they refused. Your stepsister's own grudge/jealousy might just be learned behavior, something that she can hopefully grow out of if she understands the reasons behind your father's behavior toward you and/or your aunts (if you're even interested in maintaining a relationship with her).

I\u2019m not telling you to add this but in my catty part of my brain I\u2019d want to add: you didn\u2019t want me during the first three years of my life, barely put any effort in being part of my life while I lived with you as stepsister was more important to you, and based on his past actions you are under the impression that he will not want to be in you life going forward and without him making that effort you\u2019re moving on with your life.\n\nIt\u2019s important that the two of you do things with just the two of you in order to to form any type of bond and without that you\u2019ll just be in the same spot.  As for the friend group? I would be cordial to stepsister but if she tries to engage anything with you I\u2019d ignore her, but if she says anything about how you get to go to Europe just say \u201cmy dads spending the exact same amount on me for the trip as he\u2019s giving you.\u201d", "Completely agree. The emotional impact of being in a family that treats you like you're not important is far worse than not having material things or a free ride to college.", "I feel like a lot of people are deliberately misunderstanding what I\u2019m saying. \n\nI grew up like OP\u2014with a lot of personal challenges, but also with a lot of financial privilege. And what I\u2019ve come to realize as an adult is that that financial privilege made a *huge* difference in my life. It\u2019s what allowed me to grow up in a nice house in a top school district, to promptly see a psychiatrist when I was depressed, to access the best therapies for my CP, and to go to college debt-free. When you have money, a lot of the barriers inherent to existence just aren\u2019t there. You can access your full potential because you have the time and mental energy to do so. I mean, I was a smart kid, and I worked hard, but there were probably a lot of kids who were smarter and more hard-working than me who ended up in a worse position just by virtue of the fact that they didn\u2019t have access to the stuff that I did. And that is privilege. It's an incredible privilege to be able to do what you want, to go where you want,  without having to worry about how you're going to afford it. People (particularly rich people) get really defensive when you point this out, but it's true. Class privilege, much like white privilege, is a thing that exists regardless of the personal challenges that you face. \n\nI say this because I\u2019m not sure that OP fully understands (just like I didn\u2019t understand at one point) just how much of an outlier she is. Most people don\u2019t live the way that she does, and if she goes around telling them that they should \u201cappreciate what they have\u201d when they point that out, she\u2019s gonna look super tone-deaf and out-of-touch. I don\u2019t think that stepsister handled this well at all, but she\u2019s not necessarily wrong about the money stuff. The Europe trip is a perfect example--OP and her friends know that stepsister struggles with money, but they're still planning a huge 'friend getaway' to Europe right in front of her. That's gotta hurt.", "She did not lose a parent but she happily took OP\u2019s father for herself.", "It does indeed. I wonder how she\u2019s going to fare when she doesn\u2019t have OP as a convenient person to put down.", "Exactly, and this family is not deprived either. She's just upset she doesn't get free college or a holiday, but for most of us this is just how life goes and it's not a reason to whine and resent others who aren't at fault", "I think if the step-sister were struggling to eat or whatever, I could see how material things might be more important for her. It doesn't seem like that's the situation though.\n\nWith that said, I think no one is really the asshole here except for the dad and the step-mom obviously. These are both teenagers who have never had a particularly great relationship. While telling the girl who lost her mom and never got attention from her biological father or step-mom that she's had it easier is emotionally tactless (to say the least), it's a mistake a teenager who feels deprived of something might make. Just like calling her a dumb bitch is a mistake a teenager might make in anger. This is not on either of them, and strictly on the dad and step-mom who failed as parents.", "I was searching for a post like yours for a while so I am glad I wasn't the only one thinking this. \n\nI'm glad OP has aunties that care a lot for them but this definitely isn't only a one way street. Not being aware of your financial situation and the difference that makes is pretty common. It'd suck so much not to be able to go on a holiday with all of your friends. I know, I've been in the same boat and totally missed out. \n\nI've also realised how lucky and fortunate I am compared to many of my mates when studying. They'd have to do it part time just so they could work and afford rent whereas I was able to stay at home. Made a huge difference. Have mates that've got it far easier too. All of them have the same thing in common, they understand the benefits they have and aren't dismissive of each other's problems which is why we all get along. \n\n\nYou've hit the nail on the head entirely here. OP has had a huge loss that can never be made up, but that doesn't mean they're entitled to dismiss others. It totally sucks, the situation and like you said it's turning two people who really should be able to get along, against each other. \n\nI almost wonder whether there's more to the story regarding the dad and the party and maybe trying to make up for a bit of jealousy that was there that may've been discussed prior or something. Regardless still doesn't excuse his actions. Definitely sounds like there isn't heaps of communication with OP and dad. Maybe they should go to a pub that isn't too loud so they can talk and just get shitfaced together.", "Op is not out of touch. She's talking about the parents. They were both entitled to loving parents. The parents rejected OP and kept the stepsister. \n\nThe money is a non factor in this aspect and she's just lucky that she had her aunts to fall back on. Having the supportive aunts did not make her an asshole.", "Yeah that\u2019s a good point. She may not have made the decision based on careful research, especially since she\u2019s seemingly bitter about it. Hopefully as she matures she\u2019ll realize public school is really not so bad.", "Yup, but most merit scholarships aren\u2019t a full ride, and won\u2019t make up the difference in cost between public and private. Even full tuition wouldn\u2019t necessarily do it. For some students it\u2019s still worth it to take out loans to make up the difference, for others it\u2019s not.", "According to OP's edit, everyone at their school who has a 4.0 gpa or higher is valedictorian, but OP had the highest grades. I'm a little confused by the idea of a group giving the valedictorian address?", "She mentioned that stepsister had three loving parents.  I'm sure he father did something to celebrate his daughter.", "You don't have to be rich to have a small get together.", "Don't listen to this person OP! Your stepsister's bio father/ family could have thrown a celebration for her only, if they wanted to and made it all about her (rightfully so as the girl is their OWN family). Just like your aunts celebrated you. However, your dad promised a party for BOTH his girls and didn't see it through. Imo, it was just a petty attempt of getting back at you for having your own party with  the great aunts you have. And as far as the situation goes, you cannot stop your life to accommodate your stepsister neither do you have to. Your aunts also doesn't need to go down on any of the stuff they are doing for you as your mother would have wanted every amazing thing for you and her sister is just making sure those wishes come true. If anything, your Dad sucks for enabling this situation. I wish you all the success and happiness.", "Wowza. You are awful to say this.", "It is misogynistic", "Took me a second to remember what OP called the stepsister so I was like \"Wait... entitled isn't gendered, petty isn't gendered, asshole isn't gendered... is it little?\" XD", "My brother got walked home by his friends' mom at age 4 because he called a Tonka truck he was having issues with a motherf*cker. Turns out he'd strolled by my dad fixing an engine at the cottage the weekend before \ud83e\udd23", "Why? Do you think losing a parent you literally never knew is equivalent to losing a parent with whom you've had a relationship?", "Which makes no sense because if she was smart enough to earn valedictorian- it is highly likely she would have gotten merit money from other schools. Merit money has nothing to do with finances - it\u2019s based on academics", "I feel like these posters who focus on the financial aspect are just jealous and projecting.", "Wow. Just wow. How dare you try to quantify loss like this.", "That actually makes more sense she\u2019s going to a public university. \n\nThere may have been independent scholarships she could have applied for, but I\u2019ve never known private colleges or universities to do merit based scholarships themselves. Usually they focus on need-blind acceptance instead, but they usually don\u2019t go out giving money to people who can afford to pay. \n\nAlthough that raises some more questions about why she didn\u2019t look into need blind acceptance, in that case\u2026\n\nI get the impression that she likely didn\u2019t have anyone who knew the systems well enough to advise her.", "Tbf you're probably right, any time someone on here mentions about having money or a well off relative doing nice things for the OP despite the OP having a shit home life there's always commenters always saying shit like \"but you're OK because money\" like it heals a lifetime of trauma, buys decent family members, cures terminal illness or brings the deceased back to life.", "Wow. Just wow. You don't see the difference between losing someone you know versus losing someone you don't know?", "All I'm saying is that we're hearing one side of the story. It's human nature for people to slant things to make themselves look better, everybody does it.\n\nSo much depends not on just *what* was said but *how* it was said. None of us were there.\n\nI feel a bit of sympathy for the stepsister. She has a step sister who's getting European vacations and expensive private tuition and fancy dresses, etc etc. She might very well be jealous, and I think that's understandable. And then OP tries to ruin the one material thing she does have (a graduation party) by being 'visibly upset' and calling her a bitch and leaving.\n\nI just think there's a lot of history there, and I think people are jumping in way too fast to tell OP she's perfectly in the right.", "Thanks!", "Go NC with your dad and his married family.", "Your aunts are better parents than your bio dad.
