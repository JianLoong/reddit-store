My stepsister\u2019s always been jealous because I have nicer stuff. \n\nBoth of us graduated this year. Our graduation ceremony was last Friday and our prom was the Saturday before that. I\u2019ve been living with my aunts for a few months now. They bought me a pretty expensive prom and hosted an after party (which my stepsister was at because my aunts asked me to invite her). They also threw me a graduation party that none of my dad\u2019s family came to even though they were invited. \n\nMy dad hosted a party for both of us today and asked me to stay the weekend. As I expected, the party was completely about her. I was told that it was for both of us. My dad gave a long speech about how proud he is of my stepsister. He mentioned me once but the rest of his speech was completely about her. He went on about he she worked so hard to be a valedictorian and didn\u2019t even mention that I graduated summa cum laude. \n\nI was visibly upset during dinner and afterwards my stepsister asked me to talk. We went to her room and she started talking about how I\u2019ve always had things a lot easier than her. She said that it\u2019s not fair that I always get the best things and she doesn\u2019t. I told her that life isn\u2019t always fair and she should be grateful for what she has.

She also said that I purposely humiliated her by inviting her to my prom after party so I could show off my fancy dress. Our argument got pretty heated and I called her a dumb b*tch and left the party early instead of spending the night.

You want your dad's love and attention and she wants the nicer things in life that you are getting now.\n\nShe says you have it easier even though you lost your mom... low blow.  I am sorry but she deserved to be called something much worse.  I get it, she is mad and jealous and wants to make you feel bad. You are angry and have enough and stooped to her level. \n\nWhen people push people into a corner and just expect them to take it and are surprised when they come out punching? Really?\n\nAll things considered here... You are a teenager and said something in anger when provoked.  In my book that makes you NTA. \n\nYou might want to fill your aunts in about what happened and let them deal with your dad and stepmom, if you do not want to deal with them.", "NTA. \n\nThe beauty of being 18+ and going off to college is you don't have to associate with them anymore. Love the people who'll love you back--in this case, obviously your aunts. Let dad and his wife+perfect family figure their own shit out.", "NTA, your stepsister and your dad on the otherhand. Usually Im anti gendered insults, but what an entitled petty little arsehole. She literally wanted to tell a girl who lost her mother at birth about how she's had life so easy.\n\nEdited to correct an error", "NTA.  She provoked you, you told her what you thought.    Play stupid games win stupid prizes.   I mean her, not you.   That was crappy of your dad to say it was a party for both of you then focus only on her.    There is a lot going on there, seems like sis is not the only one jealous of you.    Get me?  If it were me, I wouldn\u2019t talk to anyone in that household for a long while.  Enjoy your trip to Europe!", "NTA, stuff happens, you two are same age and will always compete against each other, compare and feel jealous etc. Frankly as parents its totally childish to get in the middle of it. She ain't crying because you called her dumb b\\*tch, she is crying because she is getting this strange feeling that you are getting ahead in life and she is stuck, its something new to her and she is having hard time coping with it. Parents should understand this and stay out of it, I am pretty sure you both will patch it up as life goes on, from your words I can say you both are pretty civil around each other and respect each other.\n\nShe has to learn not to compare herself against you and keep poking it around you, especially when she is a constant reminder how your own father loves her more. Anyway continue on with your life, no need to feel sad about this incident. \n\nI had 2 cousins same age as me, we had a raging cold war among us, its still going on tbh, we had often said mean things to each other when we were teens and it never ends so learn to live with it.", "NTA but it sounds like your step sister is a product of bad parenting and it also sounds like your father and stepmother are Disney villain parents. People like that shouldn't be able to reproduce. What AHs.\n\nI'm really glad you have your Aunties.", "NTA, she is envious of your access to financial support but she intentionally makes sure to keep your bio dad\u2019s attention on her, your sperm donor is the biggest AH here, she exacerbates that, and your lashing out was provoked.", "NTA. Tell them \u201cher graduation party?! I thought it was for the two of us?\u201d  Honestly try and have a conversation with them about everything they\u2019ve done to you or not done as it were. Tell them you\u2019ve had enough of their favoritism.", "INFO: You talk a lot about how your dad and stepmom treated you and you mention your stepsister feeling jealous of you, but how did she TREAT you?", " NTA\nYour SS initiated a heavy, emotional conversation then cried when you responded with your take on things.", "NTA. Go back to your loving aunts and live your best life! Leave the negativity behind and press on to a positive future!", "NTA you haven't \"always had it easier\", you spent the last 15 years being treated like an unwanted extra in your dad's new family, your stepsister was treated as your dad's favourite while he forgot about you. And he's STILL doing that. To your stepsister, having a few months of enjoying living with 'rich' family members who are happy to treat you and fund your education is, \"always having things easy\". She completely missed that you had to suffer before this, while as you said, she got to enjoy three parents who love her for her entire childhood. You were harsh, but I don't think your comment was wrong.   \n\n\nI think it would be worth sitting down and writing your dad a letter, explain how you feel and how you were treated. He may not get it, and it may not change anything, but it might help you to get it out there. I would also consider sending the same letter to any of his family who try to call you out about this situation.", "NTA. This sounds like a complicated situation and your father has a lot to answer for", "NTA. Ignore all of them", "ESH. \n\nCards on the table here: I do think you need to acknowledge that your aunts\u2019 financial position has made your life significantly easier than your stepsister\u2019s in a lot of ways. Sorry, but it has. You have access to the kinds of opportunities (and luxuries!) that she could never dream of. When you leave college, you will have no debt. That\u2019s a pretty exceptional thing, especially in the US. I grew up a lot like you, and it\u2019s only after I went away to school that I really understood all of the stuff that I had been sheltered from. So I\u2019m sympathetic to your stepsister\u2019s position, and based on some of her complaints I\u2019m inclined to think that you do flaunt it, a little bit (the Europe trip being one example, the whole thing feels kind of exclusionary.) Calling her a bitch was out of line, and feels disproportionate to the situation. \n\nThat said, it sounds like your stepsister is aware of your bad family dynamic and manipulates it for her own gain. You guys are in a competition, and that\u2019s her weapon of choice. She monopolizes your father\u2019s attention because she feels like it\u2019s the one thing she can actually have that you don\u2019t. \n\nBut the biggest assholes by far are your father and stepmother, who are ineffective and cowardly parents. They\u2019re at the heart of all of this shit, and they\u2019ve managed to turn two girls who should theoretically have everything in common against one another. That\u2019s a real shame.", "NTA. While calling her a bitch was not the best choice of words, I don't get the everyone sucks votes. How is losing one's mother at 3 and the  being treated like the help in dad's new fabulous family was even remotely acceptable? Like a minor being raised by the aunt and her wife cause dad checked  out was any fun or fair? Fuck that.\n\n I had a friend in a similar position, her godmother died whe  she was 6  dad checkout out and went looking for a new mom and dumped the lid with grandma. She got lovely things, but she is slightly fucked up. Her half sister is doing well, but a bit of a bitch to say the least. Understandably, but all extremely complex.  \n\nI strongly suspect  that OP would have gotten help from the aunt even if mom had been alive, but defs aunt is compensating for you know mom being dead. \nAnd OP getting in a good uni is not just about money, also her academic achievements. Feel bad step sis did not apply or try to get financial help, but that's her choice.", "ESH. I just can\u2019t with how much everyone sucks. I can\u2019t believe you two were put in this situation. I\u2019m so sorry your mom died so young and you were treated so poorly. My god this sounds like Cinderella. I get why your stepsister is jealous and I also get why you are so hurt by how your dad kicked you to the curb. I\u2019m just sorry for you guys, I hope you two work it out because sisters can be an amazing blessing. \n\nAlso, when I say ESH, I think what I mean is - your dad sucks. Royally.", "Can I ask... Where is her dad? We're they divorced or did he die?\n\nWhile I am saying ESH, please understand that she doesn't have the same advantages as you and that's hard to handle at any age, especially for someone so young.  I mean, she's watching you go off with your mutual friend group on vacation and she has to stay home.\nShe watches you get all the advantages. That must hurt. She's not making light of you losing your mother when she says things have been easier for you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Amazing women and you are lucky to have them.\n\nyour father is a jellyfish and made no decision in your favour since they day he married his wife.

You should have called your dad and the whole rest of them bitches too. \n\nI'm so sorry about your mom. \n\nIf your dad can't see the shit he has been doing and allowing to be done to you then cut him out of your life. You don't need someone to keep hurting you.", "NTA, Wait wasnt it your graduation party too? I kind of hope you said 'I thought it was our party?' I genuinely think you need to have an open and honest conversation with just your dad. There seems to be a lot of unresolved stuff here.", "Personally I think that unless you cut ties with these people, that you are going to be dealing with this for the rest of your life and it's a toxic situation to be in with them constantly trying to pull you down.\nBecause of their petty grievances.", "I am wondering what happened after your mother died that you had to be raised by your mom\u2019s sister and wife? Does he resent you because you are a reminder of your mom? \nOnce he got remarried you moved back in with him so I am guessing he is like my father was after my mom died where they can\u2019t handle being a \u201cparent\u201d and relies on a wife to do the parenting stuff? Once he got remarried he was ok with the \u201cparent image\u201d again now that he didn\u2019t have to handle raising a child by himself?\nHe might favor the step children because his \u201cfamily\u201d is intact now which is horrible is true.", "NTA. \n\nSo when she cries, and you\u2019re not there, it\u2019s *her* graduation party, huh? Interesting. \n\nI\u2019m not exactly sure what your stepsister wanted out of this conversation. Maybe she was airing her grievances, maybe she saw that you were upset and this was her (supremely weird) way of comforting you. Unfortunately, I suspect it was something much worse. Something along the lines of \u2018it\u2019s not fair, you should go to a cheaper college so your aunts can help me too\u2019. Regardless, she was way out of line. \n\nDespite being incredibly hurt, you tried to be very calm and civil. You made it clear that you\u2019re aware of the discrepancies in your lives. You used the perfect example; you have wealthy aunts, she has a living mother, attentive father and proud stepfather. By the sound of it, you\u2019d give up all the expensive prom dresses in the world to have what she does. \n\nSo do I condone you calling her names? No. But she pushed you too far, and I understand that you snapped. Given where the conversation was going, I probably would have too. \n\nThis is an awful situation, and I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re in it. I\u2019m glad you have your aunts, and I think that you should perhaps start fading out your contact with your fathers family.

So why was she confronting you during what was also your party? Her crying seems to have been something she worked herself into, because I don\u2019t see anything new for her to cry over (you calling her a rude name doesn\u2019t sound anywhere near enough to set that off). She was trying to put you in your place, to tell you that you had to suck it up that the \u201cjoint\u201d party was really all about her, and it didn\u2019t work. So now she\u2019s getting additional mileage from you supposedly upsetting her, when the things she\u2019s really complaining about aren\u2019t remotely new.", "Nta", "Sounds to me as though you both have issues with one another. Suspect that your insult was nothing uncommon between siblings, so don't think that's the issue.\n\nIf you want a good relationship with her, you could try talking to her about how you think your father favours her - which makes you jealous, and ask her what she'd like you to do about your aunt's money. If she insists that you only invited her to the party in order to humiliate her, you can say whether it's true or not & how it makes you feel.\n\nThink the key to such conversations is to focus less on what the other person did & how it made you feel.\n\nI also think an explanation is much more valuable than an apology, but if you did invite her in order to humiliate her, best to admit it, apologise and say you'll try to do better in future - if the apology and resolution are sincere - and hope she responds accordingly.", "It's clear who the assholes are and you're clearly not one of them.

Mostly your father.

Last I checked, we've all got those, LOL", "> Was this her way of saying, \"suck it up, because you have things better than me,\" or something?\n\nYes, I think that\u2019s what she was trying to do.

I had a friend that got a scholarship (solely based on academic results) but she was the type to sleep at 10pm so she could wake up at 4am to study. I worked on a few group projects with her and I always got higher scores on my parts and she got mad when I aced quizes when I skipped class or last minute studied. But she put in more consistent effort with her studying and she's the type to scribble notes during class and then rewrite the notes (by hand so she can remember them) beautifully using different colors/fonts etc and they were perfect for revision (she only shared her notes with het trusted study group).
