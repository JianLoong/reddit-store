My sons bio Dad, Matt (30m) has been offered multiple times to keep our son, Chase (5) every other weekend like a normal custody agreement so that way he could have a better relationship with him. Matt did not take me up on this offer every time I\u2019ve asked and found an excuse for why he couldn't start doing every other weekend. How he normally goes about seeing Chase is he will see him for one day (keep him over night) and bring him back to me the next morning and he does this once every 2-3 months. Chase wants to see him all the time. I've been taking a lot of things into consideration and Matt does not have the greatest past (I do not hold this against him, I just worry about him ever getting back into bad habits and bringing our son to places he should not be at or putting him into unsafe situations) as far as I know now though he is sober but he is still living with his father and Matt has made no moves to keep his son for longer than it's convenient for him. I quit answering his texts to me like 3 months ago and filed for child support after I decided to go no contact and got that set up.

Be in your kids life or don't. Random and sporadic visits once in a while probably aren't healthy.\n\nI would say though, try to keep a dialogue going if possible.", "INFO\n\nNow that you have filed for child support, what is the formal and legal custody arrangement?", "It's a really personal decision. I would have a real talk conversation with the bio dad and outline what you did here and pin him down on his answer. He may be looking for an out on parental rights. That also comes with the trade of not getting child support. If you decide to keep your son away from him by choice but also expect child support is not fair. \n\nFor reference, I went through the exact same situation (I was the custodial parent) and I did forgo child support to have him remove parental rights. But it's not for everyone. If you remove parental rights, you can also have your husband adopt him so that could be the best situation.\n\nI'd just have him meet you and talk through it and make sure you get whatever agreement in writing and file with the court. Ultimately, you should let him make the final decision on either being a parent or not.", "NTA \n\nHe doesn\u2019t even pay support and only wants to see kiddo on his terms. You\u2019ve done all you can to put things in his favor and he won\u2019t commit to being a father. At some point, if this current setup continued, he would become even more sporadic. \n\nGet support. If he wants regular custody he can advocate for that, and then commit to it", "NTA. You want what's best for Chase. Bio dad wants what's best for bio dad", "Check with your local laws. I\u2019d just stop reaching out. The onus is then on him to file for custody. At a point, it\u2019s legally considered abandonment, but that point varies from state to state.", "NTA\n\nI was just like your son once, my father did the same thing to me from a young age. He only ever wanted to be a 'dad' when it was convenient for him and he only wanted to be the fun parent. It really messed me up because I adored him and didnt understand why he only kept his promise to pick me up for visitation 25% of the time.\n\nI vividly remember one year on his birthday he had a big party in the mountains with a bunch of his friends and played with his band. I was around 7 years old and had a terrible fear of dogs at the time (love them now) and it was cold and I was extremely tired as it got late so he told me to go rest in the truck and we'd leave soon. I woke up the next morning still in that truck having to go to the bathroom and to find someones German Shepard wandering the camp and getting in to the leftover cake. He was still chatting with his friends and had spent the night drinking and servicing his ego. Still pisses me off 25+ years later, anything could have happened to me. I've been no contact with him for 3 years now", "NTA", "Why did you ask for child support if you want your husband to adopt him? I would just file the adoption paperwork and see if he shows up. I would also continue to allow biodad to see and communicate with his kid, even if adoption goes through. If adoption does go through, no child support from biodad.", "Extremely difficult situation. Soft YTA only because you haven't given bio dad a chance and communicated properly with him.\n\nIf he's a deadbeat and isn't interested in your son then let him make that decision. I think unfortunately your son will resent you if you don't at least give him a chance to try.\n\nSounds like you could still do that at this point without it being too disruptive as it's only been 3 months and bio dad has not seen him for that time before.\n\nYou need to communicate with bio dad and make it clear your kid needs more structure and consistency. If he then fails, that's on him.", "YTA, unless there's a good reason based on dad Matt's behavior, your trying to snuff out the little bit of contact Chase has with him because it would be inconvenient for you. Is Matt a big AH for not making his lad a bigger priority? Sure.  Are you a great mum for trying to give Chase stability? Absolutely.  BUTT, as you mentioned Chase wants to see his dad Matt all the time...what are you doing?!", "YTA. You are being selfish and cruel by keeping your son from his bio dad. You are denying him the chance to have a relationship with his father. You are also ignoring your son's feelings and wishes, who misses his dad and wants to spend more time with him. You are forcing your husband to be his dad, when he already has a dad who is alive and willing to be involved in his life. You are not protecting your son, you are hurting him and alienating him from you.\n\nI was in a similar situation like Chase when I was young and my mother did the same thing to me and my siblings as you do. I always missed my father and hated my mother during my youth. She thought she was doing me a favor by cutting off contact with my dad, but she was actually robbing me of a part of my identity and happiness. I resented her for years and I still have issues with trust and attachment because of her actions. Don't make the same mistake as my mother. Don't ruin your son's life and your relationship with him. Let him see his dad and let him decide for himself who he wants to call dad.", "I will preface my judgement by saying that I believe you are a good mum. The fact that you are asking for advice and looking at different perspectives proves you have your child\u2019s best interest at heart.\n\nThat being said, please consider whether no contact with bio dad is in son\u2019s best interest. Your husband can still be a father figure to Chase without having to adopt him legally. I really wouldn\u2019t push for this angle. Not when there is still the chance bio-dad can step up and commit to a future with his son. When Chase grows up, he may resent this decision and feel that you forced his bio dad out his life. Even if that is not strictly true. \n\nPersonally, I feel that you should consider low contact with bio-dad and work on maintaining that connection. Make every effort, and if it doesn\u2019t work out at least you did everything in your power to support your child. Your conscience will be clear.\n\nNAH", "Hard but I think it all depends on how bad bio dads past is, so YTA unless you give a reason why your son shouldn\u2019t see him or could be in danger", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I don\u2019t know much about family law, but it\u2019s possible that child support might get messed up \u2018cause of the adoption.", "Of course YTA", "ESH. Typically being a deadbeat father, and not paying child support is not grounds for preventing your child from seeing their parent. It sounds like you need to have an honest discussion with him and see if he truly wants to be a part of his child\u2019s life. Offer him the option to relinquish his parental rights and allow your husband to adopt the child. Get a lawyer and discuss your concerns about your ex with him/her.", "So why the change in your attitude towards him? Going no contact is pretty extreme. Maybe he\u2019s not perfect, but he is the kids dad- so usually it takes a big thing to go no contact. What happened? \n\nHow does your new husband feel about Matt?", "ESH - get the courts to decide child support and the order. Both of you will get to plead your case. But it would be unhealthy for your son to NOT want to see his biological Dad, so continue to support it in regular capacity. \n\n3 months is a joke. 4 times/year is a joke. This should be at least every month as long as Dad has a safe place for him and he's sober.", "I think YTA and I don't say this lightly because I've had a few friends be involved heavily with drugs and most of them are dead. It takes a huge toll on their families. However, Chase wants to see his dad and Matt wants to be involved. Tbh it might have been better if you cut Matt out of your son's life from the beginning since it sounds like Ethan is stepping up and being a good father figure. But for Chase to know who his real dad is, and then not give him access may be really damaging to him because you've created the expectation that he will be involved in the future.\n\nI think it would be fine if you insisted that he do more work to see him on a regular basis so that he can provide more stability to Chase's life and psyche. However cutting him out completely isn't fair to him or Chase. And on top of that, I think if he is going to pay child support he absolutely has to have visitation rights.", "YTA however rarely his dad wants to see him let him.  Then when he'solder he can make his own decision.  The dad is sober now so stop being selfish.", "yes YTA.\n\nNot only does Matt deserve to have his child in his life, but your child deserves to have a dad in his life.\n\nIts messed up to hold his past decisions over his head. He is sober and doing well now.\n\nWhat makes you think this is acceptable? Be a decent human.", " YTA - I feel so bad for the child in the middle of you two. He deserves better and cutting his bio dad out because he\u2019s gotten clean and is still inconsistent is a shitty excuse. \n\nYou literally say that your son wants to see him all the time, and then, because his father doesn\u2019t see him when you want, or is inconsistent with his visits, you go no contact and file for child support while you\u2019re already remarried. \n\nAgain, this poor child. I hope he turns out ok because it doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re acting in his best interests. Edit: and it shows by saying you want your new husband to adopt him", "> Random and sporadic visits once in a while probably aren't healthy.\n\nDefinitely are not healthy.  He needs to grow up and decide to be a father or not.", "Not healthy at all. No one is sadder than a little child who has been waiting at the window for hours, hoping Daddy will finally come like he promised.", "He has not filed for custody at all. And this is the second time I\u2019ve ever kept him from him, the first time I did it was when our son was less than 2 years old due to Matt being on pills at the time and being in and out of jail.", "Thank you for sharing, I appreciate it. I just want to make sure I\u2019m doing everything the right way and doing right by everyone. I don\u2019t want to do child support and just keep him away from him. I just want something to change for our sons sake, but you\u2019re right. A conversation will need to be had if I want this to go anywhere with him.", ">If you decide to keep your son away from him by choice but also expect child support is not fair. \n\nIf he is a dead beat then that's absolutely fair. He still made that child, so he is responsible for him financially even if he isn't in his son's life. And why should OP not get child support when the only reason for keeping the father away from the child is the child's mental health. Why should she have to coordinate keeping the guy in her life or give up child support, he is the one that needs to step up not OP.", "Tbh I wasn\u2019t sure what direction it all would head in and I just figured maybe I could have a conversation with him about it. But I have an idea that due to his pride I\u2019m not going to get a yes from him to give up his parental rights. So maybe the child support would help sway him into doing it was my hopes", ">I think unfortunately your son will resent you if you don't at least give him a chance to try.\n\nThe son is 5 years old. This guy had half a decade to make a move and he didn't, it's not on OP to bend over backwards to get him to make a commitment to his son. She did enough, she doesn't need to communicate to an adult that a child needs structure and consistency, he should have his shit together by now. And I find it really fucked up that after she was the responsible one that stayed and cared for her son  the whole time, that she is now supposed to make her own life even more stressfull and teach a whole ass adult that he needs to be a parent. No absolutely not. \n\n\nNTA", ">unless there's a good reason based on dad Matt's behavior, \n\n\nConstantly neglecting his son for months isn't reason enough? \n\nThe son always wanting his absentee father isn't enough reason to close that door until he is better equipped to deal with it, isn't enough reason?", "So your mom did all the work of raising you, but you reject her in favour of a ridiculous fantasy that your deadbeat dad would be great?\n\nBig yikes.", "> Not when there is still the chance bio-dad can step up and commit to a future with his son\n\n\n\nWhen that future comes and he is ready, HE should try to establish a relationship with his son. \n\nIt will get traumatic real soon for this child who loves his father so much and is still being dribbled this much by him. \n\nI don't think adoption is best either but that boy needs permanence and if he cannot get it from his father right now, that door should get shut until he is more grown and equipped to deal with the constant neglect.", "I\u2019m not doing any of this for money, the end goal is adoption", "Taking your kid once for a night every 3 months is hardly having them in your life. It's unfair to Chase for his dad to essentially dangle the possibility of a relationship with him over his child with no real commitment to actually being part of his life. The only person really committed to having a relationship there is Chase. It's only fair for OP to bring up these concerns to the father and ask him to step up or step away. If Matt can't commit to being an actual parent to Chase he needs to do the right thing and back off so Chase doesn't have to wonder when the next time his dad will bother to make time for him.", "I want my husband to adopt him because he actually helps me take care of our son. The entire time I was still with bio dad he refused to take care of our son. Bathing, diaper changes, would only feed him gummy worms for breakfast. I came home from work one day to him passed out on the floor while watching our son by himself because he was high in pills. I\u2019ve experienced the worst of the worst with him. And he still refuses to be a dad to him. One visit every 3 months isn\u2019t being a dad explain to me how it is", "Nta. Keep custody, Matt can file for custody if he really cares, and then you guys can communicate more. That said, ghosting Matt will only make things worse for everyone. Just clearly communicate and it will go better.", "Just because a parent is unhealthy to a child doesn't mean the child doesn't need supported. That's a ludicrous way of thinking. There a tons of reasons to not have a parent paying child support but have no contact. You do what's right for you and your son.", "But you cut off all contact so that would suggest otherwise"]}
