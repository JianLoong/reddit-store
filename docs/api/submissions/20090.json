I would have a real talk conversation with the bio dad and outline what you did here and pin him down on his answer. He may be looking for an out on parental rights. That also comes with the trade of not getting child support. If you decide to keep your son away from him by choice but also expect child support is not fair. \n\nFor reference, I went through the exact same situation (I was the custodial parent) and I did forgo child support to have him remove parental rights. But it's not for everyone. If you remove parental rights, you can also have your husband adopt him so that could be the best situation.\n\nI'd just have him meet you and talk through it and make sure you get whatever agreement in writing and file with the court. Ultimately, you should let him make the final decision on either being a parent or not.", "NTA \n\nHe doesn\u2019t even pay support and only wants to see kiddo on his terms.

He only ever wanted to be a 'dad' when it was convenient for him and he only wanted to be the fun parent. It really messed me up because I adored him and didnt understand why he only kept his promise to pick me up for visitation 25% of the time.\n\nI vividly remember one year on his birthday he had a big party in the mountains with a bunch of his friends and played with his band. I was around 7 years old and had a terrible fear of dogs at the time (love them now) and it was cold and I was extremely tired as it got late so he told me to go rest in the truck and we'd leave soon. I woke up the next morning still in that truck having to go to the bathroom and to find someones German Shepard wandering the camp and getting in to the leftover cake.

Soft YTA only because you haven't given bio dad a chance and communicated properly with him.\n\nIf he's a deadbeat and isn't interested in your son then let him make that decision. I think unfortunately your son will resent you if you don't at least give him a chance to try.\n\nSounds like you could still do that at this point without it being too disruptive as it's only been 3 months and bio dad has not seen him for that time before.\n\nYou need to communicate with bio dad and make it clear your kid needs more structure and consistency.

The fact that you are asking for advice and looking at different perspectives proves you have your child\u2019s best interest at heart.\n\nThat being said, please consider whether no contact with bio dad is in son\u2019s best interest. Your husband can still be a father figure to Chase without having to adopt him legally. I really wouldn\u2019t push for this angle. Not when there is still the chance bio-dad can step up and commit to a future with his son. When Chase grows up, he may resent this decision and feel that you forced his bio dad out his life. Even if that is not strictly true. \n\nPersonally, I feel that you should consider low contact with bio-dad and work on maintaining that connection. Make every effort, and if it doesn\u2019t work out at least you did everything in your power to support your child.

Typically being a deadbeat father, and not paying child support is not grounds for preventing your child from seeing their parent. It sounds like you need to have an honest discussion with him and see if he truly wants to be a part of his child\u2019s life. Offer him the option to relinquish his parental rights and allow your husband to adopt the child. Get a lawyer and discuss your concerns about your ex with him/her.", "So why the change in your attitude towards him? Going no contact is pretty extreme.

What happened? \n\nHow does your new husband feel about Matt?", "ESH - get the courts to decide child support and the order. Both of you will get to plead your case. But it would be unhealthy for your son to NOT want to see his biological Dad, so continue to support it in regular capacity. \n\n3 months is a joke. 4 times/year is a joke. This should be at least every month as long as Dad has a safe place for him and he's sober.", "I think YTA and I don't say this lightly because I've had a few friends be involved heavily with drugs and most of them are dead. It takes a huge toll on their families. However, Chase wants to see his dad and Matt wants to be involved. Tbh it might have been better if you cut Matt out of your son's life from the beginning since it sounds like Ethan is stepping up and being a good father figure. But for Chase to know who his real dad is, and then not give him access may be really damaging to him because you've created the expectation that he will be involved in the future.\n\nI think it would be fine if you insisted that he do more work to see him on a regular basis so that he can provide more stability to Chase's life and psyche. However cutting him out completely isn't fair to him or Chase. And on top of that, I think if he is going to pay child support he absolutely has to have visitation rights.", "YTA however rarely his dad wants to see him let him.

The dad is sober now so stop being selfish.", "yes YTA.\n\nNot only does Matt deserve to have his child in his life, but your child deserves to have a dad in his life.\n\nIts messed up to hold his past decisions over his head. He is sober and doing well now.\n\nWhat makes you think this is acceptable? Be a decent human.", " YTA - I feel so bad for the child in the middle of you two. He deserves better and cutting his bio dad out because he\u2019s gotten clean and is still inconsistent is a shitty excuse. \n\nYou literally say that your son wants to see him all the time, and then, because his father doesn\u2019t see him when you want, or is inconsistent with his visits, you go no contact and file for child support while you\u2019re already remarried. \n\nAgain, this poor child. I hope he turns out ok because it doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re acting in his best interests.

And this is the second time I\u2019ve ever kept him from him, the first time I did it was when our son was less than 2 years old due to Matt being on pills at the time and being in and out of jail.", "Thank you for sharing, I appreciate it. I just want to make sure I\u2019m doing everything the right way and doing right by everyone. I don\u2019t want to do child support and just keep him away from him.

He still made that child, so he is responsible for him financially even if he isn't in his son's life. And why should OP not get child support when the only reason for keeping the father away from the child is the child's mental health. Why should she have to coordinate keeping the guy in her life or give up child support, he is the one that needs to step up not OP.", "Tbh I wasn\u2019t sure what direction it all would head in and I just figured maybe I could have a conversation with him about it. But I have an idea that due to his pride I\u2019m not going to get a yes from him to give up his parental rights. So maybe the child support would help sway him into doing it was my hopes", ">I think unfortunately your son will resent you if you don't at least give him a chance to try.\n\nThe son is 5 years old. This guy had half a decade to make a move and he didn't, it's not on OP to bend over backwards to get him to make a commitment to his son. She did enough, she doesn't need to communicate to an adult that a child needs structure and consistency, he should have his shit together by now. And I find it really fucked up that after she was the responsible one that stayed and cared for her son  the whole time, that she is now supposed to make her own life even more stressfull and teach a whole ass adult that he needs to be a parent.

It's unfair to Chase for his dad to essentially dangle the possibility of a relationship with him over his child with no real commitment to actually being part of his life. The only person really committed to having a relationship there is Chase. It's only fair for OP to bring up these concerns to the father and ask him to step up or step away. If Matt can't commit to being an actual parent to Chase he needs to do the right thing and back off so Chase doesn't have to wonder when the next time his dad will bother to make time for him.", "I want my husband to adopt him because he actually helps me take care of our son. The entire time I was still with bio dad he refused to take care of our son. Bathing, diaper changes, would only feed him gummy worms for breakfast. I came home from work one day to him passed out on the floor while watching our son by himself because he was high in pills. I\u2019ve experienced the worst of the worst with him. And he still refuses to be a dad to him. One visit every 3 months isn\u2019t being a dad explain to me how it is", "Nta. Keep custody, Matt can file for custody if he really cares, and then you guys can communicate more. That said, ghosting Matt will only make things worse for everyone. Just clearly communicate and it will go better.", "Just because a parent is unhealthy to a child doesn't mean the child doesn't need supported. That's a ludicrous way of thinking. There a tons of reasons to not have a parent paying child support but have no contact. You do what's right for you and your son.", "But you cut off all contact so that would suggest otherwise", "NTA but it\u2019s better to let the child make that decision, cause in their eyes it\u2019s your keeping you away from him, not the dad wanting to stay away. \n\nas a kid who was in this situation it\u2019s honestly better to let them child see how the absent parent is for their own eyes", "If you keep your son from him, he can use it against you in family court. What I did when my kids mom stopped taking them for her access was not tell them she was coming, so they would stop being disappointed waiting for her at the subway only for her to call 2-3 hours after she was supposed to show up and bail. In other words, just count on him to fail. Otherwise, there\u2019s nothing wrong with your kid seeing him sporadically just as long as he\u2019s a safe parent to be with. You\u2019re not going to be able to have your new partner adopt the kid without his birth father signing off on it so the parental alienation thing is just going to be held against you if he ever does get his shit together. It sucks to be in this situation so bad and I feel so hard for you. I hope it works out in whatever way is best for your kid.", "NTA and talk to a lawyer. You have no custody agreement so neither of you is in violation of a court order for now. It's upon him to make the effort and arrangements to see his son.", "NTA. I would advise seeking legal advice as well as advice from a psychologist or social worker type and discuss what would be the best answer. You're trying to make sure that your son has a relationship with his biological father. And your husband has been the good father figure. \n\nMaybe put it as \"You either be an actual dad, or you can sign away your rights so that your son can have a stable,  dependable father. Make up your damn mind.\"\n\nIt's  not like you are being vindictive and arbitrarily keeping your son away. You tried to help them have a relationship. There's only so much you can do.", "NTA 5 is awfully young, but having a discussion with Chase might be good, too. In an age appropriate way. How does it make him feel when biodad brings him home? Is he sad about not seeing biodad that often? Is he engaging in behavior that will win biodad's approval? Does he think it's his fault that biodad doesn't come around much? \n\nMy dad was pretty absent when I was a kid, I definitely remember thinking it was my fault a lot of times. Your son has two parents that love him. It would be great if he had three, but do what you need to do to protect little man's emotional health.", "Exactly. Being a father isn\u2019t something you try because football season is over and you\u2019ve got a bit of spare time before the cricket starts\u2026", "I agree, it just sounded to me like OP went non contact and made her son non contact which is different than the guy being a deadbeat and not communicating with OP on purpose. I could have misread that part though, so if so, then I rescind my comment.", "That\u2019s pretty messed up.", "Maybe I misread, I thought OP said she went no-contact and is not communicating regarding her son, but also went to file child support while being non-communicative. Sorry if I didn't read that correctly. So that's where the comment came from. \n\nMy kids dad was a total deadbeat, for me I gave him an out and he took it, again it's totally a personal decision, just things to consider. I would have rather had him involved, but you can't control other people.", "Why should all the emotional labor fall onto op to get this guy to parent?", "Well attempting to co parent with somebody who doesn\u2019t actually want to be a parent but wants to still have the title is also pretty messed up", "Lol you\u2019re preaching to the choir. My kid hasn\u2019t seen her dad in a year and a half. She still has access to him. Idk if she\u2019s talked to him. \n\nYou only filed for child support to try and get him to relinquish his rights. He\u2019s not bothering you. He\u2019s ignoring his child. That\u2019s on him. You could\u2019ve filed for the adoption and see where that went, but you went after money. Which is why I believe it\u2019s messed up. \n\nI don\u2019t understand why people would want to force someone to do something they don\u2019t want to do. He doesn\u2019t want to parent. Be grateful you have your son and your husband and leave the deadbeat alone. Your son should still have the ability to contact him if he wants.", "Follow your gut! It's clear he doesn't want to be a dad. Cutting him out of your son's life now is for the best. Random visits are so much more harmful to a child than a bio parent not being a part of their life.", "I\u2019d definitely keep note of when  he asks and how often he visits and duration in case you go to court to modify custody, or to have your husband adopt him. \nNTA", "NTA, but this is really a legal issue. I doubt he'll sue you for custody, but judges don't look too fondly upon mothers who willfully withhold children from their fathers for visitation, regardless of the father's interest in parenting (or lack thereof). And unless you get him to give up his parental rights, your husband won't ever be able to adopt him.", "NTA. 24 hours (or less) roughly quarterly is NOT a father and it\u2019s NOT healthy for your son. It\u2019s not fair to such a little guy for someone he clearly adores to just dip in and out like that. It\u2019s cruel.", ">I just want to be a good mom.\n\nI believe you. I think you think you\u2019re doing the right thing by keeping him away but you\u2019re a bit worried you\u2019re letting your personal biases cloud your judgement. And you know it\u2019s not about what you want or even what Matt deserves or doesn\u2019t deserve; it\u2019s what\u2019s best for Chase.\n\nWhether you are right or wrong, I think only you can truly figure that out and it\u2019s by being completely honest with yourself. Is it truly harmful for Chase if Matt isn\u2019t taking full advantage of his visitation opportunities? I understand it would be better for Chase if he did, but does it truly hurt him? Someone could argue that the inconsistency hurts, but does it really? Isn\u2019t some relationship with his bio dad better than him wondering why he doesn\u2019t care at all? My gut is leaning towards letting him see him. I don\u2019t think he deserves his visitation rights, but that\u2019s besides the point.\n\nMy dad would go six months at a time without seeing me or contacting me. It wasn\u2019t great. But I\u2019m glad I still had somewhat of a relationship with him. It\u2019s not the strongest relationship, and that\u2019s his fault, but it\u2019s something and I think that\u2019s better than nothing. And Chase has two other loving parents to provide him with the security and stability Matt won\u2019t.

Child of divorce, although I was much younger and didn\u2019t really like my dad, but my older brother loved him. Our dad disappointed him over and over and my mom never closed him off to our dad, meaning he\u2019d go visit and every time call in angry tears. It really fucked him up. The lack of consistency from a parental figure is really bad for kids, so if the step dad is filling that role then bio dad can butt out. It\u2019s not about him and what he wants on a whim, it\u2019s about what\u2019s best for the kid", "I wouldn't do this without getting a custody adjustment. There could be significant consequences of your decide all of this unilaterally", "What does the custody agreement say? Has he even filed for visitation? If he decides he doesn't like the situation he can go to court and get more time awarded for visitation. The kid is only 5 and his dad half asses the visits anyway...if you quit pushing the relationship it will probably end. LET IT! Have you been around AITA very long? You'll see lots of stories of bad situations with non custodial parents and you don't want to be creating one of these! I seriously doubt your son is getting what he needs while he's with a man that can't be bothered to keep him more than a day every few months!

It just sucks, I was also one of these kids who went through this kind of mess with their parents. The only reason my bio dad even had weekend visitation with me and my older sister was because my grandma paid for his lawyer. And he made it very clear he wasn\u2019t that interested in us.

He should realise it on his own at his big age. But even if she shouldn't need to communicate with an adult, I still think it is in the best interest of her child giving him one last chance as a shock tactic to get him to pull his finger out.\n\nBest case he panics and thinks he's going to lose his child and starts being more consistent.\n\nWorse case she can demonstrate to her child that she gave him every chance to be a parent to avoid resentment.", "I think you need to consult with a child psychologist who might want to meet your son before rendering an opinion as to what's in his best interests, and with a divorce attorney to see what your options are.  \n\nBut if you have solid reason to think that your ex jeopardizes your son's safety (if this is a real thing and not an excuse), there's your answer."]}
