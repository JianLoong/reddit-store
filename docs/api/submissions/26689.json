My wife (29F) has wanted a craft room for a long time, and we finally had a chance to clean out the spare room. We live in a 3 bed 2 bath house, with no attic or basement. The spare room was a storage room, so with nowhere else to store these things we decided to have a garage sale. \n\nMajority of the things were under $5, but a small handful were around $20-$40. We also had a mid size section of free things labeled with stickers saying free. I didn\u2019t think to made a sign for it till after the fact. \n\nWe had done pretty well majority of the day, and eventually we get a woman maybe in her 50s. She had grabbed an item that I had marked at $35, and began to haggle with me. I declined, as I had already marked all items at the lowest I would take for it. The woman then came back with the $35 item and an item from the free pile. She said she\u2019d pay $35 if she could get both, and of course I accepted. \n\nSeveral hours later after my wife and I have the remaining items inside, we get a knock at the door. It was the woman demanding her money back. My wife was confused and yelled for me, I went to the door and the woman shows me the free sticker on her second item. She said I lied to her and she wouldn\u2019t have paid that for it if she knew her second item was free.\n\nI declined giving her back the money and asked her to leave my property, after a few minor protest she left. \n\nI feel kinda guilty, and my wife doesn\u2019t know how she feels in the matter so i\u2019m turning to reddit.

Also don't feel guilty. There are people that show up to garage sales to bargain no matter what price you set just so they can earn a deal. There's also just as many people who do this but steal at the same time.\n\nYou put the price, she bartered, you said no, the price is the price. She grabbed another item from the free pile and demanded the exact cost for both items, the price for one and free for the other, but it's her own dumbass fault for tricking herself into believing she earned a deal, when she just willingly purchased what she intended to buy at the price listed. She outed herself by saying she wouldn't have bought it if she knew the second item was free, fully exposing that all she wanted to do was convince you to haggle out a deal with her so she could \"win\" at your garage sale.\n\nThis is the type of personality that I have on more than one occasion had to tell to fuck off when they were at my mother's garage sale a few years ago. Some shit goes into a garage sale to get rid of it, and that's why you put a price OBO on it. Some shit is in a garage sale as a, \"I'll sell it at this price, if not i'll keep it.\" But some people are just major dicks and demand to barter for everything no matter what.\n\nEdit: barter to bargain. It's what I meant to say.", "NTA. You put a free sticker on it and it was her fault she didn\u2019t see it. The $35 she paid was for the $35 item and a free, no charge, item.", "NTA.\n\nThis is a simple value exchange.\n\nHer: \"This item is not worth $35 to me, but I want it.\"  \nYou: \"This item is worth $35 to me, so no.\"  \nHer: \"This item and this other item together are worth $35 to me.\"  \nYou: \"Ok, these two items together are also worth $35 to me. This is a fair exchange.\"  \n\nIt's not your fault she doesn't understand her own value calculation.", "NTA it's a yard sale not a department store she should have looked at the tag on the item before she negotiated, the second item could have been a more expensive item than the first. Also I feel like it's a well known fact that all sales are final at a yard sale.", "NTA \n\nLots of people will ALWAYS haggle at non-fixed stores. Winning the haggle and thinking you negotiated a bargain is often just as satisfying as getting the item itself.\n\nShe\u2019s just pissed that she wasn\u2019t able to rip you off. That\u2019s pretty hilarious!", "NTA.\n\nI would presume all items that you say are free were marked \"Free.\" \n\nIn essence, she failed to read and observe the collection of items that had stickers that clearly said \"free\" and asked specifically if she could get both that free item plus the $35 item together. She didn't ask if the free item had a price. Therefore, that error is on her end for not verifying. $35 was the original total, and still was plus a free item.\n\nThe Devil's Advocate does say that you could have mentioned that the item was free or had a sign that labels them free, but given that the transaction has already been agreed upon, paid, and you technically didnt rip her off, it's a rather minor point both before and now.", "NTA\n\nShe assigned a higher value to the item you had assigned no value; and assigned a lower value to the item you  had valued at $35. In the end she thought both items, in combination had a value higher than $35 and decided to pay for it. \n\nEconomics 101: the buyers set the price at which an item can be sold. She did just that.", "NTA\n\nThat woman is ridiculous. She came back to your home to make a fuss over basically a $5 difference in what she wanted to pay for an item that was already most likely a good deal. It\u2019s ridiculous. She chose to purchase those items. Even the items you were offering for free still had value. She got her 35 dollars worth, she is just an unreasonable person with apparently far too much time on her hands.", "NTA. I'd have offered her a 200% refund on the free item and slammed the door.", "NTA There are no backsies on garage sale items. She should have looked at the sticker.", "She was the one who made the offer. You just accepted it. \nNTA. People are annoying.", "Imagine having the nerve to come back to a garage sale to get a refund. \nWow.", "Nta", "NTA.  She offered.  You accepted.  She just wanted to get something over on you.  She got one over on herself.  You didn't even have to do anything.", "NTA. She said she\u2019d pay $35 for both and you agreed. That\u2019s a verbal contract.", "NTA.\n\nShe paid an agreed price, and all sales are final.
