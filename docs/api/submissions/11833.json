Myself and most of our siblings thrived in this lifestyle, but one of our brothers hated it. I'll call him Tom. Tom hated being outside, exercising, heat, wildlife, etc... Our parents always encouraged him to at least try something before deciding, but they let him skip things he insisted he didn't want to do.\n\nMy brother I'm closest in age with and I wanted to do a snorkeling trip together. While planning, we decided to invite our youngest siblings as well, if our parents would pitch in a bit and were okay with us watching them. We didn't invite Tom (22) though, because we knew he'd hate this trip and we figure he'd be busy with post graduation plans and everything. In addition to snorkeling, we will also be hiking, rock climbing and free diving on this trip. All of these activities are things Tom expressly hates or even cannot safely do.\n\nTom heard about the trip from our parents and is hurt that we didn't invite him. We explained that the trip would involve a lot of getting up early (which he hates) a lot of physical activity (hates) and very little to no lounging and comfort (his main priories when vacationing). He said he could still come and do his own thing and \"meet us for dinner\" (we aren't planning on hitting any restaurants). I said if he wants he can book his own room on the same dates, but we know he gets really upset when he is woken up early, so we won't share with him because we don't want to deal with that.\n\nHe feels like we're bullying him and being dicks for no reason, but we aren't trying to do that. We just want to have a good time. He says it's ridiculous that our brother in middle school and sister with special needs are considered better company than him, which isn't what we said at all, but that's how he's interpreting everything.

Interests is common are more important. That said, would have been polite to invite Tom and expect him to decline. I get why his feelings are hurt, but rationally he is probably better off. NAH.", "YTA. I think I\u2019d be pretty hurt, if my entire family went on a holiday without me, but more importantly, didn\u2019t even tell me about it or invite me. I understand you assumed he wouldn\u2019t be interested, and you\u2019re probably correct! But that\u2019s not the point here. The point is that you made an assumption and alienated a member of your family. And so you\u2019re YTA for not considering his feelings. \n\nAlso, info for the broader picture/scale of this judgement: do you go on any holidays that include activities your brother would like to do? Or are they all outdoors and active?", "I'd say YTA because if I was in his shoes I'd be feeling pretty hurt that my family, the people I grew up with, excluded me without even giving me an option to discuss it. You just made an assumption. I can see how that's hurtful. I think the fact that he had to hear about it from the parents and not from you...speaks a bit too much here. Why the secret?", "YTA.\n\nIf you\u2019re inviting all the other siblings, you should invite Tom. You can warn him about what the trip will consist of/that he should get his own room to sleep in if he doesn\u2019t want to be woken up early. However, you should absolutely not exclude him outright.", "INFO: Did the family ever join in on things Tom liked? Or did he have to suck it up or be left out to family events? \n\nI ask because it is normal for family members to have a variety of interests, and out of love for each other, you join in on each others\u2019 likes. Did anyone make that effort with Tom, or was he treated like the black sheep because he was the only one with different interests?", "YTA. There was a happy medium here - his point that he could do his own thing and meet you for dinner was absolutely valid. You could have adjusted your plans even just the the tiniest bit and found a suitable compromise. You didn\u2019t even attempt to include him, even in the most minuscule way. and yes- that\u2019s hurtful.", "\"He feels like we're bullying him and being dicks for no reason.\"\n\nThat may be because you're bullying him and being dicks for no reason. \n\nYou should have invited him, and let him decide whether he wanted to go snorkeling, hiking, etc.", "YTA. You could have at least asked him and let him make his own decision, rather than deciding for him.", "So there\u2019s this thing where even if people almost certainly would not accept the invitation, being asked still communicates to them that they were thought of and cared about. That being said, I\u2019m not sure why he couldn\u2019t have found ways to enjoy himself on the vacation even if he didn\u2019t really get to see any of you much. I do think YTA.", "NTA someone else said here, but this is a classic say no enough times people will stop inviting you. They don't owe their brother anything and they are not assholes for not inviting said brother. They are going on vacation to do activities that the brother doesn't like, not to spite him but because they enjoy such activities. They are under no obligation to change their vacation to conform to the brother. Hell imo they were more than graceful in their explanation to him. I would not have been as tactful.\n Edit: typo", "NTA \n\nMy sister knows I don\u2019t love watching live baseball or hockey and I am an athletic trainer that watches live sports for work-so she doesn\u2019t invite me to games. I find them boring and play on my phone. \n\nMy sister hates estate sales and garage sales. I don\u2019t invite her on those excursions. \n\nWe each complain about how \u201cboring\u201d that stuff is. \n\nSometimes we will go to live theater together. \n\nIf someone complains all the time about yhe hobby, they should not be surprised or hurt when they are not included", "NTA. I do feel that you should have consulted him, even if he was going to say no. Given that throughout his life the activities you were going to participate in are ones he has excused himself, it is reasonable he wouldn't want to do that.  But, He is your brother and a lot of people would like to be asked, even if they plan to say no. He could have even surprised you by wanting to do maybe one of those things. Or maybe plan meals with you so you could at least share SOME time together or even slightly alter the plan so that something he likes to do is included too. You are family, siblings. You should be able to find a few non active things in your downtime to do. A massage, a walk on the beach after snorkling. something.", "YTA\n\nIt's Tom's place to decide what he does and doesn't want to do. Maybe he loves being on vacation and having dinner with you after your activities. Maybe he likes staying behind and reading a book.\n\nOr, maybe he would have said no but, he would have felt loved, thought of, and wanted. \n\nI realize you didn't mean to hurt him. But a hug and an apology are in place here. Be happy, don't always try to be right.", "I wouldn't really say YTA. It's a very minor situation, and a learning experience. The takeaway for him is: If you say no enough times, people eventually stop asking. And the takeaway for you is: Everyone likes being invited, even if it's obvious they'll say no.", "Ok - reading the comments I was surprised up then maybe I shouldn\u2019t be.  The problem is in thinking for your brother , you forgot to include him - thus the hurt feelings (and the YTA labels).", "YTA", "INFO how old is everybody? who still lives with your parents?", "NTA. The problem I have with all the YTAs is the fact that the brother complains about getting up early and wants to go to restaurants. Those aren\u2019t things OP and their brother want to do and they would have to change their plans to accommodate him for a vacation they are planning and paying for. (As someone who has had to tiptoe around in the dark so as not to incur the wrath of a sleeping sibling - it\u2019s pretty inconvenient when trying to prepare for a big hike.) I think it\u2019s weird to keep a secret but I don\u2019t know why everyone is saying they are obligated to invite someone and change their plans?", "I hate getting up early, I hate physical activity, and I love being comfortable. I would be so relieved if you didn\u2019t invite me to do any of those things. I suggest planning a small Tom friendly vacation in the future so you can all hang out together and it doesn\u2019t feel like he\u2019s permanently banned from hanging out with you all. NTA", "YTA\n\nIt doesn't matter what you were trying to do, you made him feel horrible and he's hurt. Instead of asking him you decided to take that choice from him and made him feel excluded from the family. Part of the reason families go on vacation is to spend time with each other, more often than not the activities comes second or don't matter so long as you have each other. I'm sure he could have found alternative activities to occupy himself or even simply enjoyed being with you guys. Instead he feels unwanted and now sees how his family views him.", "YTA. You could\u2019ve plan the trip invited him and had him turn you down without a care\u2026instead, you purposely tried to keep him out of the trip while including rest of your family. You are purposefully alienating him just because he has different hobbies than you.", "NTA - why put up with his complaining when he doesn\u2019t like anything going on?  Why ruin a perfectly good vacation?  He is just upset that he can\u2019t whine and complain to create drama.", "YTA \n\nYou\u2019re excluding him because he\u2019s not into the things the rest of your family is into. Clearly he\u2019s hurt you didn\u2019t even ask, he\u2019s old enough to exclude himself from any activities you guys would do that he wouldn\u2019t like. \n\nAnd to say you weren\u2019t planning on going out to dinner is weird af. You\u2019re planning on staying in a hotel (told him he could get a separate room), so you probably won\u2019t have a kitchen to cook so you\u2019ll have to eat sometime?? It feels like you\u2019re looking for reasons for him not to come. Just say it if that\u2019s how you feel.", ">We didn't invite Tom (22) though, because we knew he'd hate this trip and we figure he'd be busy with post graduation plans and everything\n\nYTA. You should have invited him and let him choose. Now he probably doesn't even feel like he's part of the family.", "YTA- Did your family ever actually make an effort to do things Tom liked to do when he was younger? Because it reads like y\u2019all just did whatever y\u2019all like to do and if Tom didn\u2019t like it he could stay home, but your family made no effort to do anything he liked to do. It sounds a lot like he was excluded as a child and now he\u2019s excluded as an adult. And you say he has to rent his own room, but in a comment you said y\u2019all were renting a cabin. So you basically told him the only way he\u2019s allowed to come is if he rents an entire cabin by himself, despite not being able to afford it, all while y\u2019all split the cost for one cabin with help from your parents. So you\u2019ve basically ensured that he won\u2019t be able to come even if he wants to. That\u2019s especially AH behavior. And he interpreted what you were doing as you thinking your younger siblings were better company than him, because that\u2019s exactly what you are saying.", "YTA You want to have a good time by making sure your brother is the only family member left out of a family vacation. Ouch. I can see who is the black sheep in this family. Your brother deserved to be invited. He could have said no if he was not interested, but you took that choice away. And just because you want to go snorkeling doesn\u2019t mean he wouldn\u2019t find something there that interests him. People have different interests, hobbies, and personalities. Your entire family are AHs for treating him badly.\n\nQuestion here: has anyone in your family ever participated in activities your brother enjoys? Do you even know anything about his interests? This whole family dynamic sounds very toxic.", "YTA I think the way to handle it would\u2019ve been to say to everyone, including him, hey we are planning this trip, we\u2019re going to get up early, do these physical activities, prepare our own food, etc. Anyone who is interested in that can join us. At least give him the option to say no.", "YTA.\n\nJust because he isn't interested in those activities doesn't mean he isn't interested in a holiday. \n\nYou should have asked if he was interested in going on holiday even with these activities.\n\nPeople like to be included in plans even if it isn't their cup of tea.", "YTA \nThere is a saying, \"Don't assume or you will make an ass of u and me.\" \n\nThis holds true. You assumed and are the ah.", "NTA - it's your vacation! Invite who you want and who wants to do the same type of activities. You don't owe your brother a vacation that he won't enjoy and will annoy you and others who do enjoy outdoor activities.", "Sorry, NTA. He doesn\u2019t like those things. Why would you invite him? Why would you go on vacation with someone who won\u2019t partake in ANYTHING you will do. I wouldn\u2019t feel bad about it, neither should you. \n\nEdit to add: nobody is entitled to invite to a vacation. Especially if you aren\u2019t close with each other.", "Going against all the Y T A here with NTA he doesn\u2019t like all the stuff you plan on doing and would be miserable the whole trip and then complain making everybody else miserable ruining the whole trip for everyone. (Maybe next time just invite him but tell him everything you plan to do and that you won\u2019t tolerate his complaining.)", "NAH.  All of this is occuring because of cause and effect.  And it sounds like the middle school brother and sister \\*are\\* better company than him.  I'd just tell him \"Dude, I didn't invite you and your negative vibes because we're there for fun, not to listen to your complaining.\"  \n\n\nHe's allowed to be hurt.  Maybe he'll learn to change his ways.", "NTA.  \n\nAll the people saying YTA must not have had the displeasure of having a sibling or child who is contrary to all group activities that all other family members enjoy, who  go but complain incessantly, despite  knowing in advance what events are planned, and who seem hellbent on ruining everyone's vacation because they arent enjoying themselves.  They are unwilling to join family activities but complain about not being included.  \n\nBut my experience is when you try to include the contrarian child or sibling, they then try to hijack the event to suit their wants.", "YTA.

We just want to have a good time. \n\nOuch. \n\nYTA - You put a trip over your brother.", "NTA.

Even if he was into all of those things but for whatever reason you didn't want to invite him, I think that's fair game.", "YTA. you dont like your brother, just admit it. you are TA for not giving him the option just because he\u2019s different, youre not a good sibling and i bet he\u2019s felt like the black sheep his whole life and you did nothing to fix it. i hope he gets a better life and wont have to deal with you. have a shitty trip.", "NTA. The vacation plans don't include anything your brother likes to do, but the rest of you do.  You grew up with him disliking these kinds of vacations. You could have invited him, but if he decided to go he'd be unhappy and probably make the same complaints, making the vacation uncomfortable. It's your vacation.

That attitude is wrong and OP just double down. \n\nIf they dont want him on the trip they should have been upfront about it instead of being idiots and lying", "Who's sneaking around?  Do you have to declare to everyone who could theoretically be invited that they aren't invited?  Sounds ridiculous to me.  The brother is an ADULT.  He should be able to handle these situations and understand that they have different interests.

Then your vacation is good as ruined because he will complain when you inevitably wake him up in the morning and he will feel excluded seeing everyone but him having fun together. If I'm going through the trouble of planning a elaborate vacation and coordinating schedules with several individuals, I'm most definitely not intentionally throwing a wrench into my own plans.

It happens. Tom maybe trapped in the wrong family.", "YTA, because you didn't give him any agency in the decision to not go.\n\nYou could have told him about the trip and been clear that this is what we were doing and he could join you or not, but that's its not a party trip and you would be getting up early regardless or how hungover he is.", "YTA -- There is more to the vacation than just the activities that he doesn't like to do. Sure, that's going to be a big part of it, but he clearly wants to spend time with y'all--just probably not doing all the things your doing. You can spend passive time together, even if it's just for a few hours or whatever.   \n\n\nI feel like everyone is forgetting that this is a whole vacation to all these activities. It would be different if they were just going somewhere for the afternoon to snorkel or hike or whatever. But this is a whole trip with more than just these activities.

Allow him to say no and show you were thinking of him.", "Yes, YTA. It's not about the actvities, it's about being excluded without him even knowing about the trip. Your brother is right: he can join and you all can be together after the activity is done. Certainly you will go out and eat together some place, or get a drink together. There will be plenty of time left to be together and have fun and you have left him out of that possibility. This will hurt your relationship with him, but it seems you don't already care for him that much.

I LOVE my sister but her constant bemoaning really put a damper on what should have been the trip of a lifetime. \n\nSmooth things over with your brother and maybe plan a trip that you all enjoy at a later date but from personal experience inviting him along very well could be an invitation to make everyone miserable.", "I'm like Tom i won't like go outdoors, travels, wake up early, or exhausting phisycal activities and honestly i wouldn't care two fucks if my family went to do those things and didn't invited me.", "Nta.....I wouldn't expect to go on a trip I wouldn't have fun  on.

Your brother has a long history of complaints about the activities you and the rest of your family enjoy. He should be looking at himself in the mirror and asking himself why people would want his company if he is a known party-pooper. He has only himself to blame. \n\nIf your brother was looking to reform, he should approach the family, hat in hand, and ask to be included in future plans.", "NTA\n\nThis is ridiculous. I would have done the same thing as OP, makes no sense to invite someone to a vacation when in the past they have been such a pain. Just because you are family doesn't mean you get an automatic invite to family vacations, don't be a jerk who only cares about his comfort.", "NTA I'm so confused. Tom is an adult who is free to organize his own vacation and invite or not invite anyone he chooses. Similarly, OP and other siblings happen to enjoy the same hobbies and want to share them without a spoilsport whom they might love as a brother, but not like as an adventure travel companion. This is not a 'family vacation', but a vacation that happens to have some family traveling together.", "INFO: are the younger siblings you\u2019re taking with you old enough and capable of joining you for all the activities?", "NTA. Who wants to go on a trip with a person who doesn\u2019t want to do any of the things they have planned to do nor even get up early. He sounds like a pain.", "Going against the grain here with NTA. Everyone saying why not just go to dinner might not have been on an intense backpacking or hiking centered vacation before. You really do just get up early, like as early as 3-4 AM depending on how far the location is or if you want to catch a sunrise, put in miles while eating protein bars and jerky, then take turns showering/eating, and crash early. It\u2019s not like you go for a casual stroll and come back with time and energy for a nice dinner out. There\u2019s not usually evening bonding time or activities. If Tom knows this is that type of trip because the family has dragged him on them before, then he also knows his proposal isn\u2019t really feasible. A lot of places with cabins and great intense hiking aren\u2019t even close to restaurants or towns.", "\"assumed\" hes expressed his hatred for everything they're doing. hes not entitled to an invite, especially when it sounds like he'll just drag the rest down. if he won't try stuff they like, they don't have to do things he does", "they shouldn't have to try to include him when hes already expressed he hates everything they're doing", "Agreed. I get the feeling that the excluded brother definitely expects vacations and activities to cater to his interests and schedule. If I were OP, maybe I would\u2019ve mentioned it to this brother but I definitely would\u2019ve made it clear he wasn\u2019t invited\u2014yes, an AH move, but at least I\u2019d enjoy my vacation!", "THIS!!! I can\u2019t help but think they\u2019re insufferable like OP\u2019s brother. I imagine it sucks to be left out but what\u2019s even worse is a person complaining and whining at every hand. He\u2019s made it clear he doesn\u2019t like the things they\u2019d be doing.", "So obviously I\u2019m assuming here\u2026\u2026..but my thinking is that the brother would probably want to meet up with them at the end of the day and go out to dinner or stuff like that. That might sounds nice to you, but it sounds like that\u2019s not want this group wants to do. \n\nOP is saying that they aren\u2019t \u201cgoing out to dinner\u201d so it most likely means that they\u2019ll eat while they do their thing or just grab something as they go. \n\nI can totally see the brother texting or calling them to meet for dinner when maybe they aren\u2019t even hungry anymore or are just tired after a long day and want to finally chill at the hotel after a shower or something. Obviously the brother won\u2019t be tired because he\u2019s done nothing all day. \n\nNow, some might say \u201cwould it really kill the group to meet their brother for dinner at the end of the day?\u201d\u2026\u2026.I would say yes. I can see how annoying it might be to try to accommodate this person at the end of the day when the whole group had a long day of constant activity. \n\nThe whole group is going on a vacation the whole group enjoys and agree on. Having someone else come along and try to change their plans, specially when they aren\u2019t even participating in their main activities, sounds like a person I wouldn\u2019t really want around. \n\nWith that being said, I\u2019d still would have invited him but been very clear the plans the group had and that they had no interest in changing anything about those plans. If he was ok with it, he can come and be part of the plans completely or if he didn\u2019t want to wake up early he can get his own room, but risk not seeing them at all during the trip because they would be busy with their outdoors activity.", "Thank you!!! This is exactly what I\u2019ve been thinking. \n\nOP has had 22 years of listening to Tom complain about literally every aspect of this vacation. If they\u2019d asked him, he might have said yes. \n\nAnd then he would\u2019ve complained the whole time because no one wanted to do the things that no one ever wanted to do on this vacation in the first place. \n\nThe other siblings aren\u2019t being \u201cdicks for no reason,\u201d they\u2019re merely using 22 years of history to inform their decisions.", "Kitchens are a thing.", "Or that he didn\u2019t get to say yes and ruin everyone else\u2019s good time.", "They don't have to change plans, just lay out to him \"Here are the excursions we have planned for while we're on the trip, here is what else is available near where we're staying if you don't want to join us on our excursions.  Do you want to go on this trip?\"  They would still be inviting him on the trip, but it's on him whether he wants to do those things.", "YTA.  Lightly.  You should have invited him anyway, told him your plans, and that they are not subject to change.  Then, if he decides not to go, it\u2019s on him.", "Exactly! I would never waste money on going on a vacation with someone who never has any fun doing things I like to do.", "And people like you ruin things for everyone else.", "She didn\u2019t sneak around. She simply didn\u2019t not include him in her plans. Which is her right.", "LOL i actually like doing the thing OP does I dont know what your problem is though but have fun being angry for no reason", "What whining ? Are you talking about yourself and how much you bitch and complain", "It sounds like they might be your parents too, so enlighten us please.", "They didn\u2019t lie though. They just didn\u2019t invite him. \n\nI\u2019ve had my whole family go on vacation without me and them send pics and videos to our group chat that I\u2019m the only one that\u2019s not there. They didn\u2019t invite me because they assumed I couldn\u2019t go because. Guess what? They were right. I couldn\u2019t go even if they had invited me. \n\nI never got mad. I was glad they were having a good time. I\u2019m an adult. So are they. We aren\u2019t emotional teens that get upset if we don\u2019t get invited to every single thing.

There is a saying I've heard...you can only say no to someone so many times before they just stop asking...that seems pretty relevant here IMO.", "It is so not common courtesy to invite people to activities they have never participated in and have in fact expressed the exact opposite desire to NEVER participate in.\n\nAlso, family doesn't just invite family to all things by default. That is not a thing in even the tightest families I know. The brother in this instance only has himself to blame by repeatedly making his wish to not participate in these activities known.

Left out by your entire family while they go have fun together doing something else.", "NTA", "NTA- IMO if your have always said no to an active out door trip then you can't be hurt or surprised when the invitations stop. At some point the people trying to include you get tired of saying no.

You planned to do certain activities and he doesn\u2019t want to do them. Honestly it would seem rude to be on vacation with a family member but be too busy and too occupied with your already made vacation plans to really interact with them. I just don\u2019t see a point.

When discussing his celebration plans around me, he said he didn't invite me because he knew I wouldn't able to attend. It still hurt that I wasn't invited because I felt really left out.", "My extended family came up with a great solution recently! I can't hike because of a disability. My family had a big reunion vacation for two weeks in Colorado. Week 1 was lots and lots of hiking and Week 2 was primarily in town (so other options). I came for the 2nd week because I would have been left out the entire time.", "From the sounds of things OP is footing the bill. Why should he pay for someone to come on holiday to read a book indoors? If I was paying for someone to come on holiday with me, I would like them to at least do some activities with me or atleast have a wander around the country you\u2019ve vacated to.", "I agree with you that trying to mend fences is a good thing. But why does the same courtesy you are offering Tom (he gets to decide,) not apply to OP? Why should we not say, OP gets to decide what to do on their vacation? They are an adult sibling, not a parent. They didn\u2019t give birth to Tom.", "You didn't read the comments. Tom gets upset if he gets woken up when others are getting ready to go on their hikes and treks early in the morning. That's why Tom would have to have a separate room. \n\nThis also isn't a family vacation that the parents are taking the family on. This is a strenuous outdoor adventure that two brothers in the family are doing and they are taking their younger siblings who also enjoy this type of outdoor adventure, while Tom doesn't. \n\nOP doesn't plan to eat in restaurants like Tom likes to do and doesn't want to take time out of his day that he could be sleeping and getting ready for the next days strenuous adventure during which time Tom is lounging around in bed. \n\nOP and his other brother were paying for the trip themselves but when the younger siblings expressed an interest in going that's where the parents monetarily help came about. \n\nTom has expressed numerous times that he doesn't like to do the things OP likes to do. So OP dId not invite Tom on the trip.\n\nIf Tom wants a trip where they lounge around the pool for an hour and then stay inside and eat in restaurants, then HE can plan a trip and invite his siblings. \n\nOP should not be getting grief for not inviting someone who doesn't like what they are going to do and will only complain and drag everyone down with them.  This is OPs trip, he planned it and decides what happens. He doesn't have to cater to anyone else. OP is NTA.", "um, what? in this particular post OP states that brother did not like to participate in these kind of activities his whole life... not that he just started to refuse invitations all of a sudden.\n\nalso, blaming others for developing mental disorders is harmful in itself", "Other people are not responsible for your mental health.", "Many/most of the Y T A comments are saying he should be invited. Are we reading the same thread? No disrespect- I don\u2019t mind being disagreed with but that\u2019s just not accurate", "I agree. NTA", "I\u2019m the oddball in my family. They are wake up with the sun, work outside, play in the pool, run in the woods type of people. I would much rather wake up at noon and stay inside with a book. Does my family leave me out a lot? Yes, almost 90% of the time. Occasionally I join or am invited. I don\u2019t enjoy the things they like and they don\u2019t enjoy the things I like. I\u2019m not a whiner, but OP isn\u2019t wrong for not inviting him if he really will not enjoy it. My mom never invites me to the snow parties she host\u2019s because I hate snow.", "The harm is he might accept and be the contrarian person who tries to hijack the trip, yell when people are up too early, insist on dinner outings\u2026I don\u2019t think they should keep it secret but he is not entitled to an invite", "THIS^", "Nope, you don\u2019t get to come on a fully funded trip, complain the whole time and try and get everyone to do what you want to do. \n\nIt\u2019s okay to have your own interests and to not invite people to things. My sister loves festivals and raves with I\u2019m not bothered by. Wouldn\u2019t bother me one bit If I didn\u2019t get invited. Likewise, my sister has zero interest in going cage diving with great white sharks with me so I wouldn\u2019t invite her.", "OP says in the post his brother throws a fit if he\u2019s woken up early, as will inevitably happen every day on this trip.", "Doesn\u2019t sound like you love your brother. If this is all it takes for you to write him off of a trip the rest of your family is attending than it doesn\u2019t seem like you love him. Quit justifying your actions with excuses and just realize you messed up.", "So in all of your life you guys couldn\u2019t suck it up to get some food and have a family game night or something???", "No, that\u2019s a yes. Every time they weren\u2019t doing trips they were doing what Tom wanted. Trips were probably, say, 2-4 weeks a year max (because school). So that\u2019s 48 weeks a year Tom got what he wanted: to stay at home, not going out. \n\nNo trip could have been made to suit Tom, because Tom did not want to go on trips. It\u2019s a Catch 22. Parents can\u2019t go out of their way to make a trip for Tom, because Tom doesn\u2019t like trips. But staying home is what they do the majority of the time, so even if parents choose to forgo a vacation and stay home for Tom, Tom isn\u2019t going to recognize it as them doing something for him.\n\nThe reality is that Tom did get what he wanted most of the time though, because what Tom wants is the default state of things. What everyone else likes is an atypical event, which obviously happens less often.", "Other people aren't responsible but their action sure can have effect on it. And if you care about someone then I would expect to care about their mental health also.", "This is such an overdramatic response lolol.", "Yeah, but what if he decides to go?\n\nAs my grandmother used to say, \u201cYou don\u2019t bring a poop cake to your birthday party. It ruins everything.\u201d", "Really? He wants to sleep in and meet up after everyone else has done activities at a restaurant. He doesn\u2019t want to do anything the trip is actually about. He\u2019s not interested in the trip at all. \n\nHe\u2019s upset that he wasn\u2019t invited. But he has absolutely no interest in actually participating in the trip activities.", "sorry i missed typed that. Its just my opinion about the situation. I think if OP just told his brother the plan and that it would not be changing that would be fine, but he should have done that from the beginning not when the brother found out second hand.", "Exactly.", "That you but your not OPs brother he is the one who is hurt. We cant all be you and you cant expect the world to be like you as well.", "That's not really what you described in your post, you might want to edit it in. \n\nStill TA for going about things the way you did. You guys had to know that not inviting him and him finding out afterwards would upset him. Extending an invite would have kept this mess from happening.", "You actually are just making alot of assumptions on what they did for Tom though", "Better question, given Tom doesn\u2019t like trips so going on one for him wouldn\u2019t make sense: Did your parents ever decide to forgo a trip so Tom could have a staycation? Or have shorter trips to accommodate Tom?\n\nObviously, since Tom prefers the default state of staying home, most of the year you were doing what he wanted anyway. That\u2019s the problem with preferring the default.", "So he pretty much had to suck it up and deal with your wants all his life.........YTA no wonder he feels like you bully him. Total YTA", "Who says OP is fitting the bill for everyone? REALLY?", "Long time ago someone wiser than me gave me an advice. ALWAYS let people answer themselves, don't assume their answer. It works for dating, making friends and apparently planning family vacations", "He already must feel really left out as is. After this, you\u2019ve just gone and made it official. Your parents asked him to try things and seem to have tried to include him whereas you have all tried to actively exclude him. \n\nYou should have invited him and compromised by going to restaurants in the evening. It would have been a lovely way to spend time together but still allow everyone to pursue their own interests during the day. It\u2019s not his fault that he likes things that you don\u2019t and vice versa. Everyone is different! Even siblings. \n\nThe fact that you keep defending your position instead of trying to see things through your brother\u2019s eyes makes you an even bigger AH than just the story itself!! Have fun on your trip, I hope that you feel guilty about it (although I doubt it).", "Then he needs to understand that by going he\u2019s accepting the terms of the vacation.  He does not get to bitch about it because he will have known up front what was going to happen and if he ruins the trip for everyone, he will not be asked again.  If he wants to go NC after that, it\u2019s on him and no one will lose any sleep over it.", "lol all the not the assholes love to bitch and complain. I feel like theyre complaining more than tom does tbh", "I don\u2019t expect everyone to be like me. I\u2019m just saying it how it is. You can\u2019t say no to something 100x and then complain when they stop inviting you. Once he realised that the holiday is everything he dislikes and there wasn\u2019t going to be any compromising and nothing he enjoys on the trip, he should have realised why he didn\u2019t get invited. Everyone has had occasions where you haven\u2019t been invited, that\u2019s life and whilst sometimes it sucks, it\u2019s not always about you.", "For that alone, NTA. It is no fun waking up at the crack of dawn for a fun day, only to have someone - who isn\u2019t even participating - throw a fit due to losing sleep.", "You know I\u2019m not OP, right? I just did the math and realized that it\u2019s very unlikely they were traveling most of the year. So most of the time Tom gets his way because his way is the default state.\n\nPersonally, I don\u2019t see why this is such a big deal. I\u2019d invite my youngest sister to NYCC, but not my middle sister, because middle sister would hate it. But baby sis hates drinking, so I wouldn\u2019t invite her to bar, but would invite middle sister. And I\u2019m sure there are things they do that I\u2019m not invited to because I wouldn\u2019t be interested. \n\nI think the bigger problem here is that Tom likely feels that he\u2019s an outsider in his family. That\u2019s a lot more complicated than just the non-invite though.", "So you\u2019re telling me you didn\u2019t spend most of the year at home? Would you know if your parents chose to skip a vacation one year or cut another one short? If they chose a slightly more expensive hotel or decided to start the day an hour later for you? Probably not.\n\nThe problem with preferring the default is that when people do what you want you just don\u2019t notice because it\u2019s normal. Most of the year everyone did what you wanted because most of the year you were not going on trips. That\u2019s not an assumption; that\u2019s math. \n\nThere are only a certain number of vacation days in the year. Your average job gets around 2-4 weeks off a year for personal time. Most of the time you would have been home just going by the numbers.", "But as a parent,  you kind of have to go with the majority.  \nIf they live in the US then they might only get a week or 2 of vacation time.  \nI'm sure there were plenty of holiday weekends where they didn't go any where and Tom got to do what he liked, staying in. \nI mean, what do you even do on a vacation with 5 kids and not go anywhere?", "But he\u2019s still getting this trip to ruin. \n\nOP and their brother have had 22 years of this on family vacations. Why do they have to risk ruining another one?", "Woops, lol. \nI agree that it's a lot more complicated than the invite. They all need to sit down and have a rational discussion about everything.", "Your last paragraph. Idk how to respond specifically to that. As an outsider in my family, I can relate to not being invited. My family is a LOT like OP\u2019s family and I am not like that. I\u2019m also not a whiner. OP is NTA because Tom wouldn\u2019t like it. He should\u2019ve been told but not invited. My mom doesn\u2019t invite me to her snow parties because I hate the cold and wet. If he\u2019s feeling like an outsider he needs to express that. For me, I love board games and my family will play board games with me and I\u2019ll go swimming occasionally. It\u2019s a give and take thing that they all should put more effort into.", "Again you went off on your own and made up some shit and are trying to pass it off as fact. OP said the brother likes resorts nothing about just staying at home. \n\nMaking up numbers is all fun but dont try to pass it off as fact", "Well, another option is to cut ties with him.  OP may be perfectly ok with that, but the parents?  Not so much.  OP may have to plan a trip exclusively with just the parents.  Anytime they plan a \u201cfamily\u201d event, they may run into this issue.  I just don\u2019t know that OP\u2019s parents are willing to sever a relationship with their son in the name of a vacation.", "Agreed. I voted OP N-T-A earlier (on a different comment) just for Tom getting upset at being woken up early. That\u2019s a very reasonable reason not to invite someone on a trip!", "He said no such thing\u2026 \u2018Tom\u2019. Thank you for that information though.", "They don\u2019t have to cut ties with him just because they don\u2019t want to vacation with him. If Tom wants to do that, that\u2019s his own hissy fit to pitch, and frankly that sounds extreme. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to be invited to everything, and if you\u2019re not maybe it\u2019s time for a little self-reflection. \n\nYeah, it sucks not to be included, but Tom has had 22 years of making noise about not enjoying \u2014 gestures wildly \u2014 anything this vacation is meant to include. \n\nThe fact he\u2019s whining about not being invited suggests that he hasn\u2019t done that self-reflection and would definitely go out of his way to ruin everything. \n\nHis parents aren\u2019t paying for this vacation, his older siblings are. They deserve to enjoy it.", "Nah, NTA, why would you invite someone tona vacation they will hate or complain all the time."]}
