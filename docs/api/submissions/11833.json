Myself and most of our siblings thrived in this lifestyle, but one of our brothers hated it. I'll call him Tom. Tom hated being outside, exercising, heat, wildlife, etc... Our parents always encouraged him to at least try something before deciding, but they let him skip things he insisted he didn't want to do.\n\nMy brother I'm closest in age with and I wanted to do a snorkeling trip together. While planning, we decided to invite our youngest siblings as well, if our parents would pitch in a bit and were okay with us watching them. We didn't invite Tom (22) though, because we knew he'd hate this trip and we figure he'd be busy with post graduation plans and everything. In addition to snorkeling, we will also be hiking, rock climbing and free diving on this trip. All of these activities are things Tom expressly hates or even cannot safely do.\n\nTom heard about the trip from our parents and is hurt that we didn't invite him. We explained that the trip would involve a lot of getting up early (which he hates) a lot of physical activity (hates) and very little to no lounging and comfort (his main priories when vacationing). He said he could still come and do his own thing and \"meet us for dinner\" (we aren't planning on hitting any restaurants). I said if he wants he can book his own room on the same dates, but we know he gets really upset when he is woken up early, so we won't share with him because we don't want to deal with that.\n\nHe feels like we're bullying him and being dicks for no reason, but we aren't trying to do that. We just want to have a good time. He says it's ridiculous that our brother in middle school and sister with special needs are considered better company than him, which isn't what we said at all, but that's how he's interpreting everything.

Interests is common are more important. That said, would have been polite to invite Tom and expect him to decline. I get why his feelings are hurt, but rationally he is probably better off. NAH.", "YTA. I think I\u2019d be pretty hurt, if my entire family went on a holiday without me, but more importantly, didn\u2019t even tell me about it or invite me. I understand you assumed he wouldn\u2019t be interested, and you\u2019re probably correct! But that\u2019s not the point here. The point is that you made an assumption and alienated a member of your family. And so you\u2019re YTA for not considering his feelings. \n\nAlso, info for the broader picture/scale of this judgement: do you go on any holidays that include activities your brother would like to do? Or are they all outdoors and active?", "I'd say YTA because if I was in his shoes I'd be feeling pretty hurt that my family, the people I grew up with, excluded me without even giving me an option to discuss it. You just made an assumption. I can see how that's hurtful. I think the fact that he had to hear about it from the parents and not from you...speaks a bit too much here. Why the secret?", "YTA.\n\nIf you\u2019re inviting all the other siblings, you should invite Tom. You can warn him about what the trip will consist of/that he should get his own room to sleep in if he doesn\u2019t want to be woken up early. However, you should absolutely not exclude him outright.", "INFO: Did the family ever join in on things Tom liked? Or did he have to suck it up or be left out to family events? \n\nI ask because it is normal for family members to have a variety of interests, and out of love for each other, you join in on each others\u2019 likes. Did anyone make that effort with Tom, or was he treated like the black sheep because he was the only one with different interests?", "YTA. There was a happy medium here - his point that he could do his own thing and meet you for dinner was absolutely valid. You could have adjusted your plans even just the the tiniest bit and found a suitable compromise. You didn\u2019t even attempt to include him, even in the most minuscule way. and yes- that\u2019s hurtful.", "\"He feels like we're bullying him and being dicks for no reason.\"\n\nThat may be because you're bullying him and being dicks for no reason. \n\nYou should have invited him, and let him decide whether he wanted to go snorkeling, hiking, etc.", "YTA. You could have at least asked him and let him make his own decision, rather than deciding for him.", "So there\u2019s this thing where even if people almost certainly would not accept the invitation, being asked still communicates to them that they were thought of and cared about. That being said, I\u2019m not sure why he couldn\u2019t have found ways to enjoy himself on the vacation even if he didn\u2019t really get to see any of you much. I do think YTA.", "NTA someone else said here, but this is a classic say no enough times people will stop inviting you. They don't owe their brother anything and they are not assholes for not inviting said brother. They are going on vacation to do activities that the brother doesn't like, not to spite him but because they enjoy such activities. They are under no obligation to change their vacation to conform to the brother. Hell imo they were more than graceful in their explanation to him. I would not have been as tactful.\n Edit: typo", "NTA \n\nMy sister knows I don\u2019t love watching live baseball or hockey and I am an athletic trainer that watches live sports for work-so she doesn\u2019t invite me to games. I find them boring and play on my phone. \n\nMy sister hates estate sales and garage sales. I don\u2019t invite her on those excursions. \n\nWe each complain about how \u201cboring\u201d that stuff is. \n\nSometimes we will go to live theater together. \n\nIf someone complains all the time about yhe hobby, they should not be surprised or hurt when they are not included", "NTA. I do feel that you should have consulted him, even if he was going to say no. Given that throughout his life the activities you were going to participate in are ones he has excused himself, it is reasonable he wouldn't want to do that.  But, He is your brother and a lot of people would like to be asked, even if they plan to say no. He could have even surprised you by wanting to do maybe one of those things. Or maybe plan meals with you so you could at least share SOME time together or even slightly alter the plan so that something he likes to do is included too. You are family, siblings. You should be able to find a few non active things in your downtime to do. A massage, a walk on the beach after snorkling. something.", "YTA\n\nIt's Tom's place to decide what he does and doesn't want to do. Maybe he loves being on vacation and having dinner with you after your activities. Maybe he likes staying behind and reading a book.\n\nOr, maybe he would have said no but, he would have felt loved, thought of, and wanted. \n\nI realize you didn't mean to hurt him. But a hug and an apology are in place here. Be happy, don't always try to be right.", "I wouldn't really say YTA. It's a very minor situation, and a learning experience. The takeaway for him is: If you say no enough times, people eventually stop asking. And the takeaway for you is: Everyone likes being invited, even if it's obvious they'll say no.", "Ok - reading the comments I was surprised up then maybe I shouldn\u2019t be.  The problem is in thinking for your brother , you forgot to include him - thus the hurt feelings (and the YTA labels).", "YTA", "INFO how old is everybody? who still lives with your parents?", "NTA. The problem I have with all the YTAs is the fact that the brother complains about getting up early and wants to go to restaurants. Those aren\u2019t things OP and their brother want to do and they would have to change their plans to accommodate him for a vacation they are planning and paying for. (As someone who has had to tiptoe around in the dark so as not to incur the wrath of a sleeping sibling - it\u2019s pretty inconvenient when trying to prepare for a big hike.) I think it\u2019s weird to keep a secret but I don\u2019t know why everyone is saying they are obligated to invite someone and change their plans?", "I hate getting up early, I hate physical activity, and I love being comfortable. I would be so relieved if you didn\u2019t invite me to do any of those things. I suggest planning a small Tom friendly vacation in the future so you can all hang out together and it doesn\u2019t feel like he\u2019s permanently banned from hanging out with you all. NTA", "YTA\n\nIt doesn't matter what you were trying to do, you made him feel horrible and he's hurt. Instead of asking him you decided to take that choice from him and made him feel excluded from the family. Part of the reason families go on vacation is to spend time with each other, more often than not the activities comes second or don't matter so long as you have each other. I'm sure he could have found alternative activities to occupy himself or even simply enjoyed being with you guys. Instead he feels unwanted and now sees how his family views him.", "YTA. You could\u2019ve plan the trip invited him and had him turn you down without a care\u2026instead, you purposely tried to keep him out of the trip while including rest of your family. You are purposefully alienating him just because he has different hobbies than you.", "NTA - why put up with his complaining when he doesn\u2019t like anything going on?  Why ruin a perfectly good vacation?  He is just upset that he can\u2019t whine and complain to create drama.", "YTA \n\nYou\u2019re excluding him because he\u2019s not into the things the rest of your family is into. Clearly he\u2019s hurt you didn\u2019t even ask, he\u2019s old enough to exclude himself from any activities you guys would do that he wouldn\u2019t like. \n\nAnd to say you weren\u2019t planning on going out to dinner is weird af. You\u2019re planning on staying in a hotel (told him he could get a separate room), so you probably won\u2019t have a kitchen to cook so you\u2019ll have to eat sometime?? It feels like you\u2019re looking for reasons for him not to come. Just say it if that\u2019s how you feel.", ">We didn't invite Tom (22) though, because we knew he'd hate this trip and we figure he'd be busy with post graduation plans and everything\n\nYTA. You should have invited him and let him choose. Now he probably doesn't even feel like he's part of the family.", "YTA- Did your family ever actually make an effort to do things Tom liked to do when he was younger? Because it reads like y\u2019all just did whatever y\u2019all like to do and if Tom didn\u2019t like it he could stay home, but your family made no effort to do anything he liked to do. It sounds a lot like he was excluded as a child and now he\u2019s excluded as an adult. And you say he has to rent his own room, but in a comment you said y\u2019all were renting a cabin. So you basically told him the only way he\u2019s allowed to come is if he rents an entire cabin by himself, despite not being able to afford it, all while y\u2019all split the cost for one cabin with help from your parents. So you\u2019ve basically ensured that he won\u2019t be able to come even if he wants to. That\u2019s especially AH behavior. And he interpreted what you were doing as you thinking your younger siblings were better company than him, because that\u2019s exactly what you are saying.", "YTA You want to have a good time by making sure your brother is the only family member left out of a family vacation. Ouch. I can see who is the black sheep in this family. Your brother deserved to be invited. He could have said no if he was not interested, but you took that choice away. And just because you want to go snorkeling doesn\u2019t mean he wouldn\u2019t find something there that interests him. People have different interests, hobbies, and personalities. Your entire family are AHs for treating him badly.\n\nQuestion here: has anyone in your family ever participated in activities your brother enjoys? Do you even know anything about his interests? This whole family dynamic sounds very toxic.", "YTA I think the way to handle it would\u2019ve been to say to everyone, including him, hey we are planning this trip, we\u2019re going to get up early, do these physical activities, prepare our own food, etc. Anyone who is interested in that can join us. At least give him the option to say no.", "YTA.\n\nJust because he isn't interested in those activities doesn't mean he isn't interested in a holiday. \n\nYou should have asked if he was interested in going on holiday even with these activities.\n\nPeople like to be included in plans even if it isn't their cup of tea.", "YTA \nThere is a saying, \"Don't assume or you will make an ass of u and me.\" \n\nThis holds true. You assumed and are the ah.", "NTA - it's your vacation! Invite who you want and who wants to do the same type of activities. You don't owe your brother a vacation that he won't enjoy and will annoy you and others who do enjoy outdoor activities.", "Sorry, NTA. He doesn\u2019t like those things. Why would you invite him? Why would you go on vacation with someone who won\u2019t partake in ANYTHING you will do. I wouldn\u2019t feel bad about it, neither should you. \n\nEdit to add: nobody is entitled to invite to a vacation. Especially if you aren\u2019t close with each other.", "Going against all the Y T A here with NTA he doesn\u2019t like all the stuff you plan on doing and would be miserable the whole trip and then complain making everybody else miserable ruining the whole trip for everyone. (Maybe next time just invite him but tell him everything you plan to do and that you won\u2019t tolerate his complaining.)", "NAH.  All of this is occuring because of cause and effect.  And it sounds like the middle school brother and sister \\*are\\* better company than him.  I'd just tell him \"Dude, I didn't invite you and your negative vibes because we're there for fun, not to listen to your complaining.\"  \n\n\nHe's allowed to be hurt.  Maybe he'll learn to change his ways.", "NTA.  \n\nAll the people saying YTA must not have had the displeasure of having a sibling or child who is contrary to all group activities that all other family members enjoy, who  go but complain incessantly, despite  knowing in advance what events are planned, and who seem hellbent on ruining everyone's vacation because they arent enjoying themselves.  They are unwilling to join family activities but complain about not being included.  \n\nBut my experience is when you try to include the contrarian child or sibling, they then try to hijack the event to suit their wants.", "YTA.

We just want to have a good time. \n\nOuch. \n\nYTA - You put a trip over your brother.", "NTA.

Even if he was into all of those things but for whatever reason you didn't want to invite him, I think that's fair game.", "YTA. you dont like your brother, just admit it. you are TA for not giving him the option just because he\u2019s different, youre not a good sibling and i bet he\u2019s felt like the black sheep his whole life and you did nothing to fix it. i hope he gets a better life and wont have to deal with you. have a shitty trip.", "NTA. The vacation plans don't include anything your brother likes to do, but the rest of you do.  You grew up with him disliking these kinds of vacations. You could have invited him, but if he decided to go he'd be unhappy and probably make the same complaints, making the vacation uncomfortable. It's your vacation.

If you want to be invited to stuff, you have to have said yes to it in the past for it to make sense to keep asking.", "Pretty much", "But why? You may love your family and still not like them. If you\u2019re footing the bill for a trip shouldn\u2019t the guest list be people who are going to enjoy and participate?!?", "i highly doubt it maybe when they need money from him", "My brother?", "I like how OP has left out how his parents feel about this in the post.", "No, they're right. He's a complainer. I did mention it in the post. If he gets woken up by people getting ready, he throws a fit.", "Read the post\u2026", "So why not be honest why sneak around like this its bs. \n\nIf you cant be an adult and just be honest about why you dont want him on a vacation dont act like your not an AH", "but you invited most of the family and did not even bother to ask him. Its a pretty simple thing to do.", "its called common courtesy and if you actually read what i said the brother probably would have said no anyways. Atleast he was invited and can move on and do his own thing.", "Hahahaha. My brother doesn't have any money.", "Yes it was a pretty simple question", "Might want to use a different word like former brother or something but yea", "Probably didn't bother to ask them about it either, lol.", "And you lack basic manner when dealing with family as well its not like your any better. \n\nHow hard was it for you to just tell him about the trip and ask if he wanted to come and do the things you planned. You invited the majority of the family and exclude him.", "already did and the issue is that no invitation was extended to him they just decided that everyone else in the family should come and he should be excluded. That attitude is wrong and OP just double down. \n\nIf they dont want him on the trip they should have been upfront about it instead of being idiots and lying", "Who's sneaking around?  Do you have to declare to everyone who could theoretically be invited that they aren't invited?  Sounds ridiculous to me.  The brother is an ADULT.  He should be able to handle these situations and understand that they have different interests.  I like my brother and he's a really good person but we never hung out growing up and don't really do so now.  Most people I know have reasonably good relations with their siblings (some clearly don't) but hardly anyone I know hangs out with their siblings on the regular.", "If he's been asked in the past and he has never said yes, at some point, they are going to stop asking. The act of asking becomes a pointless exercise. This point seems to be going over people's head. The brother has literally never said yes to these kinds of activities. If you want to be invited to activities, there should at least be a chance you say yes to those activities.", "You got really invested in this. You've been responding to almost everyone... Bro, is this your alt account?", "lol of course you respond to that so easy to find the trolls", "Yeah, I mean, he's my brother?", "That's not how being related to people works...", "It's not a matter of difficulty. I just didn't see the point.", "That doesnt matter its common courtesy when you plan avacation with family. If you cant understand that then i dont know what else to say cause its pretty simple thing to understand. \n\nThis isnt some stranger or friend this is his brother and he is going vacation with most of his family and did not have to the courtesy of telling his brother.", "LOL\n\nWhy would you care if it is either way its not like you like your brother", "I responded because it was funny to me. My brother is graduating from college this year. He doesn't have a job.", "And? You seem to hate him", "I mean its not like you like him enough to just ask him about coming on this trip that the majority of your family is going on.", "You don\u2019t ever have to see him again. You very clearly don\u2019t like or have any respect for him. I\u2019m sure he understands this now and will avoid you all going forward", "So you cant have an honest conversation like an adult? How old are you like 12  sneaking around and planning something that includes the almost the entire family and you thought he wouldnt find out?", "Hey man, if it's you, text me and we can talk about it. You know we all love you and care about you. Let's chat.\n\nIf it isn't you, man you are way over invested in this. I think you've maybe responded to more people than I have.", "So that makes him less than to you as well? The fact is you refused to do the simple thing of asking him if he wanted to come on the trip and included most of your entire family. How you think that is fine is weird. Its a simple social cue you would think your parents would have taught you that", "I don't.", "I like my sister, but I wouldn't invite her to a musical with me, I hardly see how it's different.", "God forbid that OP has to sit down and eat in a restaurant. Seeing how he has no manners in inviting people cant expect him to know how to have table manners.", "You're just making stuff up. There was no sneaking. We just didn't invite him. That's all.", "I never said he was less. I just was amused this commentor thought I would ever ask my jobless little brother for money. It's just funny to me.", "You've yet to say anything nice about him in the post or in comments.", "Sure well hopefully he got the message and you don\u2019t hear from him again", "I honestly dont know why you posted here if you dont care about what you did then. \n\nJust be a dick and be happy i guess", "You went and told the whole family expect him and are acting all surprised he is upset.", "I like how you ignored the rest of the comment. So why is it that you were able to ask everyone else in your family but a simple ask to your brother is too much to do?", "I didn't say anything mean about him either. I didn't say much about any of my siblings, just described the situation that started the conflict.", ">> He says it\u2019s ridiculous that our brother in middle school and sister with special needs are considered better company than him, which isn\u2019t what we said at all\n\nYou pretty much are saying exactly that though. \n\nI see where you are coming from, but inviting all the siblings minus one is exclusionary and an AH move. YTA", "A gentle YTA - in my family, we have a member who absolutely hates anything to do with socializing. We still invite her but also clarify that the event is full of socializing and cannot be changed to not include socializing. We\u2019ve even got to the point of prefacing the invitation with \u201cyou\u2019re probably going to hate this event but I want to invite you anyway\u201d. Every once in awhile, she surprises us with wanting to socialize and says \u201cyes\u201d. She also never wanted to skydive but dang did she have fun watching us doing it.\n\nThe saying \u201cit\u2019s the thought that counts\u201d is important here. You can lay out the plan beforehand and discuss it with him. A little kindness goes a long way.", "YTA", "NTA. People are saying stuff like \"you should have at least invited him to be polite\", but what if for some reason, he actually said yes? Then what? Then your vacation is good as ruined because he will complain when you inevitably wake him up in the morning and he will feel excluded seeing everyone but him having fun together. If I'm going through the trouble of planning a elaborate vacation and coordinating schedules with several individuals, I'm most definitely not intentionally throwing a wrench into my own plans. It was much better to just not invite him to begin with. Unfortunately, Reddit tends to be very lacking in nuance and black and white in general, and exclusion tends to be one them.", "If you weren't planning on hitting any restaurant how do you plan on eating on vacation?", "YTA. You should've at least gone through the motions and asked him to give him a chance to decline.", "Since your brother is graduating, perhaps your parents can send him on a mini vacation with friends who like the same things that he likes. \n\nAlso, was he switched at birth I wonder? It happens. Tom maybe trapped in the wrong family.", "YTA, because you didn't give him any agency in the decision to not go.\n\nYou could have told him about the trip and been clear that this is what we were doing and he could join you or not, but that's its not a party trip and you would be getting up early regardless or how hungover he is.", "YTA -- There is more to the vacation than just the activities that he doesn't like to do. Sure, that's going to be a big part of it, but he clearly wants to spend time with y'all--just probably not doing all the things your doing. You can spend passive time together, even if it's just for a few hours or whatever.   \n\n\nI feel like everyone is forgetting that this is a whole vacation to all these activities. It would be different if they were just going somewhere for the afternoon to snorkel or hike or whatever. But this is a whole trip with more than just these activities. Even if you don't plan on hitting up any restaurants, you still have to eat.", "Poor dude just wants to be included by his family and taking into consideration, just once. You say your parents were fine with letting him stay home when he wasn't interested in what everyone else was doing, but did anyone in that family ever make an effort to do what he wanted to do, once?\n\nBeing the black sheep sucks YTA", "YTA. Allow him to say no and show you were thinking of him.", "Yes, YTA. It's not about the actvities, it's about being excluded without him even knowing about the trip. Your brother is right: he can join and you all can be together after the activity is done. Certainly you will go out and eat together some place, or get a drink together. There will be plenty of time left to be together and have fun and you have left him out of that possibility. This will hurt your relationship with him, but it seems you don't already care for him that much. And that is what your brother knows and feels: OP doesn't care about me.", "Im pretty sure the people who are voting Y T A here have never been on a hike with someone who hates hiking. These comments are wild. Tom is 22 years old it\u2019s not like you\u2019re leaving a 15 year old kid at home. \n\nNTA and I\u2019ll hike up and die on this hill. Your brother would try to change your itinerary and complain the whole trip. The fact that he thinks he can meet you at a restaurants you\u2019re not planning on going to really shows he doesn\u2019t get it. \n\nFWIW I got a room at sperry chalet in Glacier National park a few years ago. It\u2019s a bucket list thing for a lot of people and hella hard to book. I got 5 person room and was guilted into taking my \u201cI hate the outdoors but it will look good on my Instagram\u201d sister. I LOVE my sister but her constant bemoaning really put a damper on what should have been the trip of a lifetime. \n\nSmooth things over with your brother and maybe plan a trip that you all enjoy at a later date but from personal experience inviting him along very well could be an invitation to make everyone miserable.", "I'm like Tom i won't like go outdoors, travels, wake up early, or exhausting phisycal activities and honestly i wouldn't care two fucks if my family went to do those things and didn't invited me.", "Nta.....I wouldn't expect to go on a trip I wouldn't have fun  on. Yeah its nice to be asked but I also don't like being asked out of pity either.\n\nTom needs to either change his attitude or find something he likes to do.", "NTA you can be compassionate to him wanting to be wanted, but you have to respect who he is and what he likes \u2026 and not taking him along is doing that.", "NTA. \nBoy who cried wolf. \nAnd it sounds like he\u2019s more upset he didn\u2019t get to say no.", "It sounds like a pretty typical case of \"I don't want to go but it would be nice to be invited\". NTA, but I probably would have invited him under the condition that nobody is changing their plans for him, so if he wants to go, he can't complain.", "NTA. Your brother has a long history of complaints about the activities you and the rest of your family enjoy. He should be looking at himself in the mirror and asking himself why people would want his company if he is a known party-pooper. He has only himself to blame. \n\nIf your brother was looking to reform, he should approach the family, hat in hand, and ask to be included in future plans.", "NTA\n\nThis is ridiculous. I would have done the same thing as OP, makes no sense to invite someone to a vacation when in the past they have been such a pain. Just because you are family doesn't mean you get an automatic invite to family vacations, don't be a jerk who only cares about his comfort.", "NTA I'm so confused. Tom is an adult who is free to organize his own vacation and invite or not invite anyone he chooses. Similarly, OP and other siblings happen to enjoy the same hobbies and want to share them without a spoilsport whom they might love as a brother, but not like as an adventure travel companion. This is not a 'family vacation', but a vacation that happens to have some family traveling together.", "INFO: are the younger siblings you\u2019re taking with you old enough and capable of joining you for all the activities?", "NTA. Who wants to go on a trip with a person who doesn\u2019t want to do any of the things they have planned to do nor even get up early. He sounds like a pain.", "Going against the grain here with NTA. Everyone saying why not just go to dinner might not have been on an intense backpacking or hiking centered vacation before. You really do just get up early, like as early as 3-4 AM depending on how far the location is or if you want to catch a sunrise, put in miles while eating protein bars and jerky, then take turns showering/eating, and crash early. It\u2019s not like you go for a casual stroll and come back with time and energy for a nice dinner out. There\u2019s not usually evening bonding time or activities.", "\"assumed\" hes expressed his hatred for everything they're doing. hes not entitled to an invite, especially when it sounds like he'll just drag the rest down. if he won't try stuff they like, they don't have to do things he does", "they shouldn't have to try to include him when hes already expressed he hates everything they're doing", "Agreed. I get the feeling that the excluded brother definitely expects vacations and activities to cater to his interests and schedule. If I were OP, maybe I would\u2019ve mentioned it to this brother but I definitely would\u2019ve made it clear he wasn\u2019t invited\u2014yes, an AH move, but at least I\u2019d enjoy my vacation!", "THIS!!! I can\u2019t help but think they\u2019re insufferable like OP\u2019s brother. I imagine it sucks to be left out but what\u2019s even worse is a person complaining and whining at every hand. He\u2019s made it clear he doesn\u2019t like the things they\u2019d be doing.", "So obviously I\u2019m assuming here\u2026\u2026..but my thinking is that the brother would probably want to meet up with them at the end of the day and go out to dinner or stuff like that. That might sounds nice to you, but it sounds like that\u2019s not want this group wants to do. \n\nOP is saying that they aren\u2019t \u201cgoing out to dinner\u201d so it most likely means that they\u2019ll eat while they do their thing or just grab something as they go. \n\nI can totally see the brother texting or calling them to meet for dinner when maybe they aren\u2019t even hungry anymore or are just tired after a long day and want to finally chill at the hotel after a shower or something. Obviously the brother won\u2019t be tired because he\u2019s done nothing all day. \n\nNow, some might say \u201cwould it really kill the group to meet their brother for dinner at the end of the day?\u201d\u2026\u2026.I would say yes. I can see how annoying it might be to try to accommodate this person at the end of the day when the whole group had a long day of constant activity. \n\nThe whole group is going on a vacation the whole group enjoys and agree on. Having someone else come along and try to change their plans, specially when they aren\u2019t even participating in their main activities, sounds like a person I wouldn\u2019t really want around. \n\nWith that being said, I\u2019d still would have invited him but been very clear the plans the group had and that they had no interest in changing anything about those plans. If he was ok with it, he can come and be part of the plans completely or if he didn\u2019t want to wake up early he can get his own room, but risk not seeing them at all during the trip because they would be busy with their outdoors activity.", "Thank you!!! This is exactly what I\u2019ve been thinking. \n\nOP has had 22 years of listening to Tom complain about literally every aspect of this vacation. If they\u2019d asked him, he might have said yes. \n\nAnd then he would\u2019ve complained the whole time because no one wanted to do the things that no one ever wanted to do on this vacation in the first place. \n\nThe other siblings aren\u2019t being \u201cdicks for no reason,\u201d they\u2019re merely using 22 years of history to inform their decisions.", "Kitchens are a thing.", "Or that he didn\u2019t get to say yes and ruin everyone else\u2019s good time.", "They don't have to change plans, just lay out to him \"Here are the excursions we have planned for while we're on the trip, here is what else is available near where we're staying if you don't want to join us on our excursions.  Do you want to go on this trip?\"  They would still be inviting him on the trip, but it's on him whether he wants to do those things.", "YTA.  Lightly.  You should have invited him anyway, told him your plans, and that they are not subject to change.  Then, if he decides not to go, it\u2019s on him.", "Exactly! I would never waste money on going on a vacation with someone who never has any fun doing things I like to do.", "And people like you ruin things for everyone else.", "She didn\u2019t sneak around. She simply didn\u2019t not include him in her plans. Which is her right.", "LOL i actually like doing the thing OP does I dont know what your problem is though but have fun being angry for no reason", "What whining ? Are you talking about yourself and how much you bitch and complain", "It sounds like they might be your parents too, so enlighten us please.", "They didn\u2019t lie though. They just didn\u2019t invite him. \n\nI\u2019ve had my whole family go on vacation without me and them send pics and videos to our group chat that I\u2019m the only one that\u2019s not there. They didn\u2019t invite me because they assumed I couldn\u2019t go because. Guess what? They were right. I couldn\u2019t go even if they had invited me. \n\nI never got mad. I was glad they were having a good time. I\u2019m an adult. So are they. We aren\u2019t emotional teens that get upset if we don\u2019t get invited to every single thing. They was no reason for them to have \u201can honest conversation\u201d with me beforehand, because they know I\u2019m not a child. \n\nThey weren\u2019t \u201cbeing idiots and lying\u201d to me. \n\nSounds like OPs brother has a lot of growing up to do. Stop being a party pooper and maybe you\u2019ll get invited places again.", "lol go ask OP", "That's not necessarily true. There is a saying I've heard...you can only say no to someone so many times before they just stop asking...that seems pretty relevant here IMO.", "It is so not common courtesy to invite people to activities they have never participated in and have in fact expressed the exact opposite desire to NEVER participate in.\n\nAlso, family doesn't just invite family to all things by default. That is not a thing in even the tightest families I know. The brother in this instance only has himself to blame by repeatedly making his wish to not participate in these activities known. This is akin to a family of meat eaters repeatedly inviting the one militant vegan to their BBQs.", "No! He just doesn\u2019t want him around or to *feel included!* That\u2019s different! His hobbies are just rubbish. OPs are the only interesting thing anyone can do so he *couldn\u2019t* invite his brother!", "But YTA", "Probably because he's bored and has more free time than you. I don't even know you and I'm invested a lil. Because I'm also bored. \n\nBut you know, YTA, right? You excluded your brother. You invited everyone but him. He's your family. Like someone mentioned above, it's just common courtesy to invite your brother. Even if he declines, at least he knows he's got the option to go. Ever thought he'd want to spend time with you guys even tho you don't have the same hobby? Dude probably just wants to feel like you guys want to spend time with him,too.", "Why would you want to spend time with someone who hates doing everything you like to do and is consistently complaining about it??"]}
