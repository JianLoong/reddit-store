Myself and most of our siblings thrived in this lifestyle, but one of our brothers hated it. I'll call him Tom. Tom hated being outside, exercising, heat, wildlife, etc... Our parents always encouraged him to at least try something before deciding, but they let him skip things he insisted he didn't want to do.\n\nMy brother I'm closest in age with and I wanted to do a snorkeling trip together. While planning, we decided to invite our youngest siblings as well, if our parents would pitch in a bit and were okay with us watching them. We didn't invite Tom (22) though, because we knew he'd hate this trip and we figure he'd be busy with post graduation plans and everything. In addition to snorkeling, we will also be hiking, rock climbing and free diving on this trip. All of these activities are things Tom expressly hates or even cannot safely do.\n\nTom heard about the trip from our parents and is hurt that we didn't invite him. We explained that the trip would involve a lot of getting up early (which he hates) a lot of physical activity (hates) and very little to no lounging and comfort (his main priories when vacationing). He said he could still come and do his own thing and \"meet us for dinner\" (we aren't planning on hitting any restaurants). I said if he wants he can book his own room on the same dates, but we know he gets really upset when he is woken up early, so we won't share with him because we don't want to deal with that.\n\nHe feels like we're bullying him and being dicks for no reason, but we aren't trying to do that. We just want to have a good time. He says it's ridiculous that our brother in middle school and sister with special needs are considered better company than him, which isn't what we said at all, but that's how he's interpreting everything.

Interests in common are more important. That said, would have been polite to invite Tom and expect him to decline. I get why his feelings are hurt, but rationally he is probably better off. NAH.", "YTA. I think I\u2019d be pretty hurt, if my entire family went on a holiday without me, but more importantly, didn\u2019t even tell me about it or invite me. I understand you assumed he wouldn\u2019t be interested, and you\u2019re probably correct! But that\u2019s not the point here. The point is that you made an assumption and alienated a member of your family. And so you\u2019re YTA for not considering his feelings. \n\nAlso, info for the broader picture/scale of this judgement: do you go on any holidays that include activities your brother would like to do? Or are they all outdoors and active?", "I'd say YTA because if I was in his shoes I'd be feeling pretty hurt that my family, the people I grew up with, excluded me without even giving me an option to discuss it. You just made an assumption. I can see how that's hurtful. I think the fact that he had to hear about it from the parents and not from you...speaks a bit too much here. Why the secret?", "YTA.\n\nIf you\u2019re inviting all the other siblings, you should invite Tom. You can warn him about what the trip will consist of/that he should get his own room to sleep in if he doesn\u2019t want to be woken up early. However, you should absolutely not exclude him outright.", "INFO: Did the family ever join in on things Tom liked? Or did he have to suck it up or be left out to family events? \n\nI ask because it is normal for family members to have a variety of interests, and out of love for each other, you join in on each others\u2019 likes. Did anyone make that effort with Tom, or was he treated like the black sheep because he was the only one with different interests?", "YTA. There was a happy medium here - his point that he could do his own thing and meet you for dinner was absolutely valid. You could have adjusted your plans even just the the tiniest bit and found a suitable compromise. You didn\u2019t even attempt to include him, even in the most minuscule way. and yes- that\u2019s hurtful.", "\"He feels like we're bullying him and being dicks for no reason.\"\n\nThat may be because you're bullying him and being dicks for no reason. \n\nYou should have invited him, and let him decide whether he wanted to go snorkeling, hiking, etc.", "YTA. You could have at least asked him and let him make his own decision, rather than deciding for him.", "So there\u2019s this thing where even if people almost certainly would not accept the invitation, being asked still communicates to them that they were thought of and cared about. That being said, I\u2019m not sure why he couldn\u2019t have found ways to enjoy himself on the vacation even if he didn\u2019t really get to see any of you much. I do think YTA.", "NTA someone else said here, but this is a classic say no enough times people will stop inviting you. They don't owe their brother anything and they are not assholes for not inviting said brother. They are going on vacation to do activities that the brother doesn't like, not to spite him but because they enjoy such activities. They are under no obligation to change their vacation to conform to the brother. Hell imo they were more than graceful in their explanation to him. I would not have been as tactful.\n Edit: typo", "NTA \n\nMy sister knows I don\u2019t love watching live baseball or hockey and I am an athletic trainer that watches live sports for work-so she doesn\u2019t invite me to games. I find them boring and play on my phone. \n\nMy sister hates estate sales and garage sales. I don\u2019t invite her on those excursions. \n\nWe each complain about how \u201cboring\u201d that stuff is. \n\nSometimes we will go to live theater together. \n\nIf someone complains all the time about yhe hobby, they should not be surprised or hurt when they are not included", "NTA. I do feel that you should have consulted him, even if he was going to say no. Given that throughout his life the activities you were going to participate in are ones he has excused himself, it is reasonable he wouldn't want to do that.  But, He is your brother and a lot of people would like to be asked, even if they plan to say no. He could have even surprised you by wanting to do maybe one of those things. Or maybe plan meals with you so you could at least share SOME time together or even slightly alter the plan so that something he likes to do is included too. You are family, siblings. You should be able to find a few non active things in your downtime to do. A massage, a walk on the beach after snorkling. something.", "YTA\n\nIt's Tom's place to decide what he does and doesn't want to do. Maybe he loves being on vacation and having dinner with you after your activities. Maybe he likes staying behind and reading a book.\n\nOr, maybe he would have said no but, he would have felt loved, thought of, and wanted. \n\nI realize you didn't mean to hurt him. But a hug and an apology are in place here. Be happy, don't always try to be right.", "I wouldn't really say YTA. It's a very minor situation, and a learning experience. The takeaway for him is: If you say no enough times, people eventually stop asking. And the takeaway for you is: Everyone likes being invited, even if it's obvious they'll say no.", "Ok - reading the comments I was surprised up then maybe I shouldn\u2019t be.  The problem is in thinking for your brother , you forgot to include him - thus the hurt feelings (and the YTA labels).", "YTA", "INFO how old is everybody? who still lives with your parents?", "NTA. The problem I have with all the YTAs is the fact that the brother complains about getting up early and wants to go to restaurants. Those aren\u2019t things OP and their brother want to do and they would have to change their plans to accommodate him for a vacation they are planning and paying for. (As someone who has had to tiptoe around in the dark so as not to incur the wrath of a sleeping sibling - it\u2019s pretty inconvenient when trying to prepare for a big hike.) I think it\u2019s weird to keep a secret but I don\u2019t know why everyone is saying they are obligated to invite someone and change their plans?", "I hate getting up early, I hate physical activity, and I love being comfortable. I would be so relieved if you didn\u2019t invite me to do any of those things. I suggest planning a small Tom friendly vacation in the future so you can all hang out together and it doesn\u2019t feel like he\u2019s permanently banned from hanging out with you all. NTA", "YTA\n\nIt doesn't matter what you were trying to do, you made him feel horrible and he's hurt. Instead of asking him you decided to take that choice from him and made him feel excluded from the family. Part of the reason families go on vacation is to spend time with each other, more often than not the activities comes second or don't matter so long as you have each other. I'm sure he could have found alternative activities to occupy himself or even simply enjoyed being with you guys. Instead he feels unwanted and now sees how his family views him.", "YTA. You could\u2019ve plan the trip invited him and had him turn you down without a care\u2026instead, you purposely tried to keep him out of the trip while including rest of your family. You are purposefully alienating him just because he has different hobbies than you.", "NTA - why put up with his complaining when he doesn\u2019t like anything going on?  Why ruin a perfectly good vacation?  He is just upset that he can\u2019t whine and complain to create drama.", "YTA \n\nYou\u2019re excluding him because he\u2019s not into the things the rest of your family is into. Clearly he\u2019s hurt you didn\u2019t even ask, he\u2019s old enough to exclude himself from any activities you guys would do that he wouldn\u2019t like. \n\nAnd to say you weren\u2019t planning on going out to dinner is weird af. You\u2019re planning on staying in a hotel (told him he could get a separate room), so you probably won\u2019t have a kitchen to cook so you\u2019ll have to eat sometime?? It feels like you\u2019re looking for reasons for him not to come. Just say it if that\u2019s how you feel.", ">We didn't invite Tom (22) though, because we knew he'd hate this trip and we figure he'd be busy with post graduation plans and everything\n\nYTA. You should have invited him and let him choose. Now he probably doesn't even feel like he's part of the family.", "YTA- Did your family ever actually make an effort to do things Tom liked to do when he was younger? Because it reads like y\u2019all just did whatever y\u2019all like to do and if Tom didn\u2019t like it he could stay home, but your family made no effort to do anything he liked to do. It sounds a lot like he was excluded as a child and now he\u2019s excluded as an adult. And you say he has to rent his own room, but in a comment you said y\u2019all were renting a cabin. So you basically told him the only way he\u2019s allowed to come is if he rents an entire cabin by himself, despite not being able to afford it, all while y\u2019all split the cost for one cabin with help from your parents. So you\u2019ve basically ensured that he won\u2019t be able to come even if he wants to. That\u2019s especially AH behavior. And he interpreted what you were doing as you thinking your younger siblings were better company than him, because that\u2019s exactly what you are saying.", "YTA You want to have a good time by making sure your brother is the only family member left out of a family vacation. Ouch. I can see who is the black sheep in this family. Your brother deserved to be invited. He could have said no if he was not interested, but you took that choice away. And just because you want to go snorkeling doesn\u2019t mean he wouldn\u2019t find something there that interests him. People have different interests, hobbies, and personalities. Your entire family are AHs for treating him badly.\n\nQuestion here: has anyone in your family ever participated in activities your brother enjoys? Do you even know anything about his interests? This whole family dynamic sounds very toxic.", "YTA I think the way to handle it would\u2019ve been to say to everyone, including him, hey we are planning this trip, we\u2019re going to get up early, do these physical activities, prepare our own food, etc. Anyone who is interested in that can join us. At least give him the option to say no.", "YTA.\n\nJust because he isn't interested in those activities doesn't mean he isn't interested in a holiday. \n\nYou should have asked if he was interested in going on holiday even with these activities.\n\nPeople like to be included in plans even if it isn't their cup of tea.", "YTA \nThere is a saying, \"Don't assume or you will make an ass of u and me.\" \n\nThis holds true. You assumed and are the ah.", "NTA - it's your vacation! Invite who you want and who wants to do the same type of activities. You don't owe your brother a vacation that he won't enjoy and will annoy you and others who do enjoy outdoor activities.", "Sorry, NTA. He doesn\u2019t like those things. Why would you invite him? Why would you go on vacation with someone who won\u2019t partake in ANYTHING you will do. I wouldn\u2019t feel bad about it, neither should you. \n\nEdit to add: nobody is entitled to invite to a vacation. Especially if you aren\u2019t close with each other.", "Going against all the Y T A here with NTA he doesn\u2019t like all the stuff you plan on doing and would be miserable the whole trip and then complain making everybody else miserable ruining the whole trip for everyone. (Maybe next time just invite him but tell him everything you plan to do and that you won\u2019t tolerate his complaining.)", "NAH.  All of this is occuring because of cause and effect.  And it sounds like the middle school brother and sister \\*are\\* better company than him.  I'd just tell him \"Dude, I didn't invite you and your negative vibes because we're there for fun, not to listen to your complaining.\"  \n\n\nHe's allowed to be hurt.  Maybe he'll learn to change his ways.", "NTA.  \n\nAll the people saying YTA must not have had the displeasure of having a sibling or child who is contrary to all group activities that all other family members enjoy, who  go but complain incessantly, despite  knowing in advance what events are planned, and who seem hellbent on ruining everyone's vacation because they arent enjoying themselves.  They are unwilling to join family activities but complain about not being included.  \n\nBut my experience is when you try to include the contrarian child or sibling, they then try to hijack the event to suit their wants.", "YTA.

We just want to have a good time. \n\nOuch. \n\nYTA - You put a trip over your brother.", "NTA.

Even if he was into all of those things but for whatever reason you didn't want to invite him, I think that's fair game.", "YTA. you dont like your brother, just admit it. you are TA for not giving him the option just because he\u2019s different, youre not a good sibling and i bet he\u2019s felt like the black sheep his whole life and you did nothing to fix it. i hope he gets a better life and wont have to deal with you. have a shitty trip.", "NTA. The vacation plans don't include anything your brother likes to do, but the rest of you do.  You grew up with him disliking these kinds of vacations. You could have invited him, but if he decided to go he'd be unhappy and probably make the same complaints, making the vacation uncomfortable. It's your vacation.

That attitude is wrong and OP just double down. \n\nIf they dont want him on the trip they should have been upfront about it instead of being idiots and lying", "Who's sneaking around?  Do you have to declare to everyone who could theoretically be invited that they aren't invited?  Sounds ridiculous to me.  The brother is an ADULT.  He should be able to handle these situations and understand that they have different interests.

Then your vacation is good as ruined because he will complain when you inevitably wake him up in the morning and he will feel excluded seeing everyone but him having fun together. If I'm going through the trouble of planning a elaborate vacation and coordinating schedules with several individuals, I'm most definitely not intentionally throwing a wrench into my own plans.

It happens. Tom maybe trapped in the wrong family.", "YTA, because you didn't give him any agency in the decision to not go.\n\nYou could have told him about the trip and been clear that this is what we were doing and he could join you or not, but that's its not a party trip and you would be getting up early regardless or how hungover he is.", "YTA -- There is more to the vacation than just the activities that he doesn't like to do. Sure, that's going to be a big part of it, but he clearly wants to spend time with y'all--just probably not doing all the things your doing. You can spend passive time together, even if it's just for a few hours or whatever.   \n\n\nI feel like everyone is forgetting that this is a whole vacation to all these activities. It would be different if they were just going somewhere for the afternoon to snorkel or hike or whatever. But this is a whole trip with more than just these activities.

Allow him to say no and show you were thinking of him.", "Yes, YTA. It's not about the actvities, it's about being excluded without him even knowing about the trip. Your brother is right: he can join and you all can be together after the activity is done. Certainly you will go out and eat together some place, or get a drink together. There will be plenty of time left to be together and have fun and you have left him out of that possibility. This will hurt your relationship with him, but it seems you don't already care for him that much.

I LOVE my sister but her constant bemoaning really put a damper on what should have been the trip of a lifetime. \n\nSmooth things over with your brother and maybe plan a trip that you all enjoy at a later date but from personal experience inviting him along very well could be an invitation to make everyone miserable.", "I'm like Tom i won't like go outdoors, travels, wake up early, or exhausting phisycal activities and honestly i wouldn't care two fucks if my family went to do those things and didn't invited me.", "Nta.....I wouldn't expect to go on a trip I wouldn't have fun  on.

Your brother has a long history of complaints about the activities you and the rest of your family enjoy. He should be looking at himself in the mirror and asking himself why people would want his company if he is a known party-pooper. He has only himself to blame. \n\nIf your brother was looking to reform, he should approach the family, hat in hand, and ask to be included in future plans.", "NTA\n\nThis is ridiculous. I would have done the same thing as OP, makes no sense to invite someone to a vacation when in the past they have been such a pain. Just because you are family doesn't mean you get an automatic invite to family vacations, don't be a jerk who only cares about his comfort.", "NTA I'm so confused. Tom is an adult who is free to organize his own vacation and invite or not invite anyone he chooses. Similarly, OP and other siblings happen to enjoy the same hobbies and want to share them without a spoilsport whom they might love as a brother, but not like as an adventure travel companion. This is not a 'family vacation', but a vacation that happens to have some family traveling together.", "INFO: are the younger siblings you\u2019re taking with you old enough and capable of joining you for all the activities?", "NTA. Who wants to go on a trip with a person who doesn\u2019t want to do any of the things they have planned to do nor even get up early. He sounds like a pain.", "Going against the grain here with NTA. Everyone saying why not just go to dinner might not have been on an intense backpacking or hiking centered vacation before. You really do just get up early, like as early as 3-4 AM depending on how far the location is or if you want to catch a sunrise, put in miles while eating protein bars and jerky, then take turns showering/eating, and crash early. It\u2019s not like you go for a casual stroll and come back with time and energy for a nice dinner out. There\u2019s not usually evening bonding time or activities. If Tom knows this is that type of trip because the family has dragged him on them before, then he also knows his proposal isn\u2019t really feasible. A lot of places with cabins and great intense hiking aren\u2019t even close to restaurants or towns.", "\"assumed\" hes expressed his hatred for everything they're doing. hes not entitled to an invite, especially when it sounds like he'll just drag the rest down. if he won't try stuff they like, they don't have to do things he does", "they shouldn't have to try to include him when hes already expressed he hates everything they're doing", "Agreed. I get the feeling that the excluded brother definitely expects vacations and activities to cater to his interests and schedule. If I were OP, maybe I would\u2019ve mentioned it to this brother but I definitely would\u2019ve made it clear he wasn\u2019t invited\u2014yes, an AH move, but at least I\u2019d enjoy my vacation!", "THIS!!! I can\u2019t help but think they\u2019re insufferable like OP\u2019s brother. I imagine it sucks to be left out but what\u2019s even worse is a person complaining and whining at every hand. He\u2019s made it clear he doesn\u2019t like the things they\u2019d be doing.", "So obviously I\u2019m assuming here\u2026\u2026..but my thinking is that the brother would probably want to meet up with them at the end of the day and go out to dinner or stuff like that. That might sounds nice to you, but it sounds like that\u2019s not want this group wants to do. \n\nOP is saying that they aren\u2019t \u201cgoing out to dinner\u201d so it most likely means that they\u2019ll eat while they do their thing or just grab something as they go. \n\nI can totally see the brother texting or calling them to meet for dinner when maybe they aren\u2019t even hungry anymore or are just tired after a long day and want to finally chill at the hotel after a shower or something. Obviously the brother won\u2019t be tired because he\u2019s done nothing all day. \n\nNow, some might say \u201cwould it really kill the group to meet their brother for dinner at the end of the day?\u201d\u2026\u2026.I would say yes. I can see how annoying it might be to try to accommodate this person at the end of the day when the whole group had a long day of constant activity. \n\nThe whole group is going on a vacation the whole group enjoys and agree on. Having someone else come along and try to change their plans, specially when they aren\u2019t even participating in their main activities, sounds like a person I wouldn\u2019t really want around. \n\nWith that being said, I\u2019d still would have invited him but been very clear the plans the group had and that they had no interest in changing anything about those plans. If he was ok with it, he can come and be part of the plans completely or if he didn\u2019t want to wake up early he can get his own room, but risk not seeing them at all during the trip because they would be busy with their outdoors activity.", "Thank you!!! This is exactly what I\u2019ve been thinking. \n\nOP has had 22 years of listening to Tom complain about literally every aspect of this vacation. If they\u2019d asked him, he might have said yes. \n\nAnd then he would\u2019ve complained the whole time because no one wanted to do the things that no one ever wanted to do on this vacation in the first place. \n\nThe other siblings aren\u2019t being \u201cdicks for no reason,\u201d they\u2019re merely using 22 years of history to inform their decisions.", "Kitchens are a thing.", "Or that he didn\u2019t get to say yes and ruin everyone else\u2019s good time.", "They don't have to change plans, just lay out to him \"Here are the excursions we have planned for while we're on the trip, here is what else is available near where we're staying if you don't want to join us on our excursions.  Do you want to go on this trip?\"  They would still be inviting him on the trip, but it's on him whether he wants to do those things.", "YTA.  Lightly.  You should have invited him anyway, told him your plans, and that they are not subject to change.  Then, if he decides not to go, it\u2019s on him.", "Exactly! I would never waste money on going on a vacation with someone who never has any fun doing things I like to do.", "And people like you ruin things for everyone else.", "She didn\u2019t sneak around. She simply didn\u2019t not include him in her plans. Which is her right.", "LOL i actually like doing the thing OP does I dont know what your problem is though but have fun being angry for no reason", "What whining ? Are you talking about yourself and how much you bitch and complain", "It sounds like they might be your parents too, so enlighten us please.", "They didn\u2019t lie though. They just didn\u2019t invite him. \n\nI\u2019ve had my whole family go on vacation without me and them send pics and videos to our group chat that I\u2019m the only one that\u2019s not there. They didn\u2019t invite me because they assumed I couldn\u2019t go because. Guess what? They were right. I couldn\u2019t go even if they had invited me. \n\nI never got mad. I was glad they were having a good time. I\u2019m an adult. So are they. We aren\u2019t emotional teens that get upset if we don\u2019t get invited to every single thing.

There is a saying I've heard...you can only say no to someone so many times before they just stop asking...that seems pretty relevant here IMO.", "It is so not common courtesy to invite people to activities they have never participated in and have in fact expressed the exact opposite desire to NEVER participate in.\n\nAlso, family doesn't just invite family to all things by default. That is not a thing in even the tightest families I know. The brother in this instance only has himself to blame by repeatedly making his wish to not participate in these activities known.

Left out by your entire family while they go have fun together doing something else.", "NTA", "NTA- IMO if your have always said no to an active out door trip then you can't be hurt or surprised when the invitations stop. At some point the people trying to include you get tired of saying no.

You planned to do certain activities and he doesn\u2019t want to do them. Honestly it would seem rude to be on vacation with a family member but be too busy and too occupied with your already made vacation plans to really interact with them. I just don\u2019t see a point.

So OP dId not invite Tom on the trip.\n\nIf Tom wants a trip where they lounge around the pool for an hour and then stay inside and eat in restaurants, then HE can plan a trip and invite his siblings. \n\nOP should not be getting grief for not inviting someone who doesn't like what they are going to do and will only complain and drag everyone down with them.

Parents can\u2019t go out of their way to make a trip for Tom, because Tom doesn\u2019t like trips. But staying home is what they do the majority of the time, so even if parents choose to forgo a vacation and stay home for Tom, Tom isn\u2019t going to recognize it as them doing something for him.\n\nThe reality is that Tom did get what he wanted most of the time though, because what Tom wants is the default state of things.

I just did the math and realized that it\u2019s very unlikely they were traveling most of the year.

I\u2019d invite my youngest sister to NYCC, but not my middle sister, because middle sister would hate it. But baby sis hates drinking, so I wouldn\u2019t invite her to bar, but would invite middle sister. And I\u2019m sure there are things they do that I\u2019m not invited to because I wouldn\u2019t be interested. \n\nI think the bigger problem here is that Tom likely feels that he\u2019s an outsider in his family. That\u2019s a lot more complicated than just the non-invite though.", "So you\u2019re telling me you didn\u2019t spend most of the year at home? Would you know if your parents chose to skip a vacation one year or cut another one short? If they chose a slightly more expensive hotel or decided to start the day an hour later for you? Probably not.\n\nThe problem with preferring the default is that when people do what you want you just don\u2019t notice because it\u2019s normal. Most of the year everyone did what you wanted because most of the year you were not going on trips. That\u2019s not an assumption; that\u2019s math. \n\nThere are only a certain number of vacation days in the year. Your average job gets around 2-4 weeks off a year for personal time. Most of the time you would have been home just going by the numbers.", "But as a parent,  you kind of have to go with the majority.  \nIf they live in the US then they might only get a week or 2 of vacation time.  \nI'm sure there were plenty of holiday weekends where they didn't go any where and Tom got to do what he liked, staying in. \nI mean, what do you even do on a vacation with 5 kids and not go anywhere?", "But he\u2019s still getting this trip to ruin. \n\nOP and their brother have had 22 years of this on family vacations. Why do they have to risk ruining another one?", "Woops, lol. \nI agree that it's a lot more complicated than the invite. They all need to sit down and have a rational discussion about everything.", "Your last paragraph. Idk how to respond specifically to that. As an outsider in my family, I can relate to not being invited. My family is a LOT like OP\u2019s family and I am not like that. I\u2019m also not a whiner. OP is NTA because Tom wouldn\u2019t like it. He should\u2019ve been told but not invited. My mom doesn\u2019t invite me to her snow parties because I hate the cold and wet. If he\u2019s feeling like an outsider he needs to express that. For me, I love board games and my family will play board games with me and I\u2019ll go swimming occasionally. It\u2019s a give and take thing that they all should put more effort into.", "Again you went off on your own and made up some shit and are trying to pass it off as fact. OP said the brother likes resorts nothing about just staying at home. \n\nMaking up numbers is all fun but dont try to pass it off as fact", "Well, another option is to cut ties with him.  OP may be perfectly ok with that, but the parents?  Not so much.  OP may have to plan a trip exclusively with just the parents.  Anytime they plan a \u201cfamily\u201d event, they may run into this issue.  I just don\u2019t know that OP\u2019s parents are willing to sever a relationship with their son in the name of a vacation.", "Agreed. I voted OP N-T-A earlier (on a different comment) just for Tom getting upset at being woken up early.

Thank you for that information though.", "They don\u2019t have to cut ties with him just because they don\u2019t want to vacation with him. If Tom wants to do that, that\u2019s his own hissy fit to pitch, and frankly that sounds extreme. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to be invited to everything, and if you\u2019re not maybe it\u2019s time for a little self-reflection. \n\nYeah, it sucks not to be included, but Tom has had 22 years of making noise about not enjoying \u2014 gestures wildly \u2014 anything this vacation is meant to include. \n\nThe fact he\u2019s whining about not being invited suggests that he hasn\u2019t done that self-reflection and would definitely go out of his way to ruin everything. \n\nHis parents aren\u2019t paying for this vacation, his older siblings are. They deserve to enjoy it.", "Nah, NTA, why would you invite someone tona vacation they will hate or complain all the time.", "NTA, I'm guessing if you invited him and he came, he'd either try hijacking the trip or complain that everyone is off doing things he doesn't like leaving him all alone.  I can see why he's upset and feels excluded but he should come to his senses and realize this isn't a family vacation but a vacation to do those activities with people who happen to be family.", "Yta. I have 7 older brothers. We definitely don't share all of the same hobbies. It would hurt me waiting if every other sibling was invited and it wasn't even brought up to me. You even invited the ones who were too young to pay for themselves or look after themselves and ignored him. That's fucking harsh. Even when he told you that he felt left out and wanted to go, you couldn't even compromise by going to dinner with him one night? You're selfish af. Please don't procreate. You aren't empathetic enough to have children.", "Big YTA.   \n\n\nI think you couldve at least given him the opportunity to get his own room from the get go. Especially bc your parents are helping pay. Also, I call BS on no restaurants. What are you going to eat beef jerky the entire time? Youre going to have to eat somewhere at least for dinner. Even if you're cooking he could come over to cook, hang, and eat. Also, snorkeling can literally be done by a small child, IMO is very relaxing, and I dont really consider it physical activity. I think this is probably why he mentioned your siblings. Based on the description of activities it sounds like you're going to a tropical island. Like there are million things to do in that environment and someone who hates exercise would probably be perfectly happy sitting on a beach all day or even outside in nature reading and soaking up the sun if there's no beach. I have frequently traveled solo and that sounds fantastic.   \n\n\nThe other thing I have to say is that he's 22, he's no longer a child and he's allowed to change and not be pigeonholed. The sleeping thing I get isn't something you necessarily grow out of but everything else smells like BS to me and sounds like your really dont love your brother which is really sad.", "I would say YTA in terms of communication alone. I think if you had contacted him in the early planning stage and laid out the trip and itinerary, then asked him if any of it sounded enjoyable? That would have been family-friendly and inclusive. If his answer was no but he still wanted to come, then you could have figured out separate but nearby accomodations with the caveat that he woud be spending little to no time with the rest of you. Anything after that is his call and his responsibilty.", "NTA Tom is 22 and needs to grow up. He needs to understand that him joining would ruin everyone else\u2019s vacation. It\u2019s harsh but he needs to understand exactly why. Having one person who doesn\u2019t partake but still needs to be accommodated in a huge pain in the ass and inconveniences everyone else. \n\nIf the group has a hike planned, they eat lunch half way and when they\u2019re done and exhausted they now can\u2019t stop somewhere spontaneously, because they have to go back and get Tom. Then everyone goes to dinner and everyone talks about the hike and things they saw and the inside jokes from things that\u2019s happened that day and Tom sits there and pouts and the only time he says anything is \u201ccan we talk about something else? \n\nConversely if they go snorkeling and free diving and no one wants to go to dinner everyone just wants to order room service and get to bed early, now Tom is up and awake and ready for dinner so now people have to force themselves to go out when they don\u2019t want to or Tom is going to again feel left out and either way everyone is resentful of Tom and vice versa.\n\nTom would be an inconvenient, wet-blanket and ruin everyone else\u2019s time. If Tom can\u2019t be self-aware enough to realize that his attendance and accommodating him will not only inconvenience everyone it will put a huge damper everyone else\u2019s vacation, and if he\u2019s that self-aware then someone needs to tell him. Probably nicer than how I phrased it but being how he doesn\u2019t seem to get the message rude and direct us sometimes needed.", "YTA.\n\nTact and courtesy are dying traits it'd would seem, looking at all the NTA responses.\n\nIt doesn't matter if he says no a thousand times, you extend the invitation.

We said ok cool. We said we'd be booking lots of excursions to historical sites like ruins of old cities, temples, etc. We'd do some fun beach stuff too but the focus would be exploration. She said ok.\n\nDuring the trip she complained EVERY MORNING about waking up early. Seriously, non stop complaining for 10+ minutes about how she didn't get enough sleep, how someone was snoring, how it was too early, how she didn't want to see more rocks, etc etc\n\nShe spent THE MAJORITY of the time complaining.

It doesnt work.", "YTA. Every year my family does a huge rafting/ camping trip. It\u2019s a family joke that my idea of roughing it is a four star hotel instead of a five star. I\u2019d sooner die than go camping for multiple reasons. But you know what? Every year I get invited to go, and every year I decline with no hard feelings between any of us. What they don\u2019t do is plan it behind my back and never offer me a chance.", "YTA\n\nCommon courtesy would be to let him know about the event. Give him the chance to say no.", "YTA all the way. You made assumption, you excluded him without talking to him. Perhaps if you did invite him he will have declined, but no because he's excluded. Or perhaps he will have makes his own thing, but you excluded him. And sorry,  dinner is an option. Darn, are you not going to dinner after a day of sport with kids growing up...just skip it ?? I mean, or you all cook together and eat or you eat outside. And sure, he doesn't like outdoor activity and he has to make an effort to adapt to you, but you guys can do the same for him 1 or 2 night and go to a restaurant. You know being good person, human, siblings.

Just saying.", "YTA.

You should have invite him and let him make his own decision. With all that you don't have to change anything about your trip to accommodate him. I mean he can just lay on the beach a whole day, if he wants, and meet you at evening.", "NTA: if you were doing one physically active thing a day and then a lot of regular touristy things it would be different.

There are certainly other things you can do with him.  \nI also think it's understandable that after he found out about it, you told him that he have his own room because he doesn't get up early, but you do. I also always found it annoying to be quiet when my sister was still asleep and I had to get ready when we were still sharing a room.  \nAlso the fact that you don't meet for dinner in a restaurant because you already have other plans is also understandable.  \nThat's why I understand that you didn't invite him, because in principle you won't spend any time with him during the vacation.  \nSo I can totally understand your decision, when you and your other brother planned this trip, not to have invited him. BUT I also think that the moment it turned from a vacation of the two of you to a family vacation, you should have at least told him what was planned and whether he wanted to come or not. Of course the circumstances are the same and as I said I understand that you have not invited him before. But as the ONLY one not to be invited is a little bit AH.", "INFO: is Tom significantly heavier than the other siblings?", "NTA- it's a trip filled with things brother loathes and he hates being woken up early so he needs his own room. I hope i didn't misread but OP said they aren't planning to eat at restaurants either so that's another  thing they won't sync on. I think they should have told him they were doing this vacation upfront. I have no interest in cruise ships so if my family wanted to do a cruise i'd say \"have fun!\" and not be the least upset not to be invited.", "Idk OP, I'm kind of leaning on a NAH. Like I definitely understand your bro being hurt over not being invited, but I also have to say that if you constantly express you absolutely despise something, you shouldn't be surprised if people pick up on that and no longer try to involve you with it. Going off personal experiences, as a kid, I made it clear I really didn't like a certain video game. Eventually my friends stopped inviting me when they planned to have long sessions of that game since they knew I wouldn't enjoy it. I didn't fault them for that since I set the precedent for that activity.", "NTA my brother is like this and it ruined every family vacation i went on growing up because he refused to participate in anything we wanted to do.

Every single vacation we went on was tailored to him. So we spent the summers in cold countries (he didn\u2019t like the heat) with no beaches (he hates sand (it\u2019s coarse and rough)) visiting science museums. Me and my sister vacation alone now because of that. We go to hot countries, lounge on the beach, hike, visit restaurants that are more than just burger and fries.

Nope, I absolutely can\u2019t go but feeling included or thought of is nice. Plus, who knows what else he could find to do while you are all on your adventures.

Now that you and your brother are adults you\u2019re continuing a tradition of family vacations, which is great. But if you invite the younger two and don\u2019t at least discuss the trip with Tom, it\u2019s a pretty big exclusion.

The problem is that the OP doesn't want to fundamentally alter their trip.\n\nSo keeping that desire in mind, they could plan another vacation together at a later date, or they could meet on weekends for dinner and forget about vacationing together entirely. Basically, no one should be forced to vacation together if they do not want to.\n\nPersonally, I do not vacation with all my family members (even the ones living close to me), nor do I vacation with all my local friends either.

Mom, Dad and two of the kids were great, got up there and sang their hearts out enthusiastically, everyone was very impressed.  Clearly a family that was super into this sort of thing.\n\nLast son goes up, starts singing, and he is TERRIBLE. Just not good at all, and he knew it, and everyone who had sat there watching the rest of his family shine on stage knew it too.  He made it about halfway through the song before he just burst into tears and his parents went up and brought him back down into the audience.\n\nClearly your brother has expressed a lifelong disinterest in the things that the rest of the family enjoys and excels at.

They got to do a tour of the pit and everything. I wasn't invited but I'm not butthurt over it because I hated going to the local racetrack every weekend as a kid. It was dusty and loud, but we ALL had to go because I was 10, and it was a family activity. I was miserable. Haven't gone since I was old enough to choose not to go. So why would they invite me to come along if they know I'd be miserable?\n\nI wonder if OPs brother also got presents on other kids' birthdays or when other siblings earned something, the brother benefited somehow by default for the sake of fairness.\n\nNTA\n\nEdit: formatting and additional thought.", "YTA for not at least asking.\n\nI'm not saying you need to have changed your plans to accommodate him, but a quick message along the lines of \"Just letting you know me and siblings are going on an outdoors activity vacation, you're welcome to come but we will be doing X, Y, Z, getting up early and won't be eating at restaurants.

Imagine having to grow up in a family that you feel like you don't belong to, your not as athletic, you don't like outdoor activities, you want you vacation to be chill and laid back but you just don't fit in. Now imagine you are all grown up and that same family who you always felt like you were on the outside looking in shows you that you were never wrong, they just don't care if you are there and never did.\n\nWhat makes YTA here for me is you never spoke to him like an adult and said hey we are all planning this trip. It will be comprised of mostly outdoor stuff you aren't a fan of but you are welcome to come. However that is not what you did, you withheld the plans from him, he found out from your parents, which had to hurt him, then you continue to tell him how he isn't fun and you don't want to deal with him.

He is clearly excluded, no matter how you want to frame it. If it was just you and another sibling I'd say NTA, but in this case, it's normal that he feels left out. Furthermore, the impression that I get from your phrasing, OP, is that you don't approve of his habits. Not everyone likes outdoors activities. It doesn't make them 'lazy' or 'inactive'. Many people prefer reading over sports, music or films over hiking. Imagine things being the other way around. Most of your sibling are into chilling out and reading, and they are organising a different type of trip without inviting you, because 'you are not into chilling and having a relaxed vacation'. How would you feel? Wouldn't you want to be included and choose for yourself?", "YTA because you made a unilateral decision for him and then kept it a secret. You are treating him like a problem you don't want to deal with.\n\nAdults use their words.\n\n\"Tom this is the trip we are going on. This is the plan. Do you want to come?\" Tom can then decide like an adult if he wants to come or not. If you are worried about waking him up he gets his own room. If he complains you say, \"We told you how the trip was planned, we're sorry you are unhappy.\" And then you go on a hike.\n\nIs this harder than just ostracizing him? Yes. Are you acting like everyone is an adult and can deal with their own emotions? Also yes.", "YTA. Your parents are bigger AHs. What a shitty way to raise kids.

I played basketball and tournament softball into my 30s  and they weren't interested in that. Ok, good enough. The issue (for me) is the trips they plan around ball games-their favorite team (my alma mater, too) frequently makes the playoffs and get offered a Bowl Game but they never invite me...because I don't like football. That's what they said 10 years ago when I asked why I didn't get invited to Las Vegas. You know, like that Bowl Game was the only thing happening in Vegas that weekend lol. It just happened again in the past year. Over time, I just accepted it. It doesn't mean it doesn't matter, it's just another reason I am very LC with them.

My girls and I go camping every summer and we don't invite everyone because they hate bugs and campfire smoke. It's all fine.", "MY MOTHER OMFG!!!!!!", "Yep. Makes me feel like i like in a different universe than others sometimes", "First off, to be clear, I\u2019m obstaining from actually ruling on who TA is in this because I can see both sides of it so staying neutral. Will probably still be downvoted  like crazy though\u2026\n\nHowever, I still feel the need to comment as the person who is historically the contrarian in my family.\n\nI haven\u2019t ruined any family trips since I was a child/teenager who was forced to do these things by my parents. And it was truly being forced, because I wasn\u2019t allowed to stay home alone or at the hotel/lodge/resort without supervision until I was 18 and in college. It truly sucks being forced to do activities that you hate on every single family vacation. And for me, it was every single vacation because the outdoorsy trips were cheaper and all my parents had money for.\n\nIt sounds to me like this family never\u2014or very rarely\u2014went on trips growing up that Tom would like to do. Of course you\u2019re going to seem like a complete nuisence and a funkiller on these trips when you never get to go on family trips that don\u2019t involve outdoorsy activities. On the reverse, it\u2019s so very common (and understandable) to focus on what the majority want to do and not on that one contrarian, but when you\u2019re the contrarian on those trips you aren\u2019t going to be thinking that.\n\nHave they (meaning the parents) ever even given him the option of going on the family trip and not having to do the outdoorsy activities? If they didn\u2019t, maybe if they had he wouldn\u2019t have complained so much. But that\u2019s on their parents, not OP.\n\nIf nothing changes (for future trips, not this one) and the only trips are outdoorsy ones then Tom is always going to feel excluded by his family. That feeling of being excluded is going to get worse as the years pass.\n\nFortunately, my family (mostly siblings and cousins) still invites me on group vacations and doesn\u2019t exclude me. They spend the day doing whatever outdoorsy activity they planned and I spend the day exploring the town, shopping, at the beach, by the fire in the cabin, at the spa, etc. Then we meet up for drinks or dinner at night; sometimes they\u2019re too tired for that and while I may be disappointed to not spend any time with them that day, I accept it. Sometimes I don\u2019t even go on the trips, but at least I was asked. And when I\u2019m planning a trip, even if the outdoorsy aspect is limited to exploring a city, I will invite them and give them the option. Sometimes they join me, sometimes they don\u2019t.\n\nTom may be completely fine being excluded from the activities while still being on the trip. He may be fine with meeting up for drinks or dinner just a couple times during the trip (though it sounds like he would expect it nightly, which I think is a bit much). There\u2019s no solution that is going to satisfy everyone, especially not for this trip and there really shouldn\u2019t be for this trip. But going forward, I feel like this entire family needs to make more of an effort to include Tom in planning vacations and doing some things that Tom likes to do instead of always gearing the trips for the majority.", "Completely agree. There's been many family vacations I've not been invited to, because I'm not a beach person and don't do great in heat. Hell I usually only find out last minute that their all going. Yes sometimes it sucks because occasionally there's things I'd love to join, but I do understand why they don't ask. I'd say NAH.

Sounds like Tom has put a lot of time into crafting his reputation as a whiny curmudgeon, and now the concept of spending their limited vacation funds and PTO trying to tiptoe around him sounds less appealing than not having to tiptoe around him. Crazy how that works, almost like our actions compound into consequences. \n\n>Even if I don't like my whole family I still tell the ones I don't like to spend time with 'we are doing x y z' and they are completely fine as the feeling is mutual or the activities are really not their thing.\n\nGood for you, very thoughtful!

Choosing to spend time on a shared hobby with people whom you share that interest/hobby with is one of the major perks of being an adult and making your own plans. Mom isn't making your play dates anymore and can't force you to play with the whiny kind that cries constantly and doesn't play well with others. \n\n>That's pretentious and assholish and just plain bratty.\n\nOnce again we seem to have entirely different definitions. I think, \"I want to go on an active adventure holiday with my siblings who share my sense of adventure and level of physical activity,\" is perfectly in-bounds. Alternatively, I think \"I'm the center of the universe and so you're obligated to think about my wants and feelings even when it comes to your own plans and personal time.

You never know he could surprise y\u2019all one of these days and decide to join in on the fun but how will you know if you count him out without even asking first? I\u2019ve also been left out of family gatherings because everyone just assumes I wouldn\u2019t be interested but that\u2019s not always the case 100% of the time and it really sucks to be intentionally left out.

I suggested sunscreen, he didnt like the texture, i suggested long sleeve shirts & clothing with spf built in, he said he would be too hot, i suggested an umbrella to keep sun & heat off him, but that was too much trouble, he said h didnt want.to carry the umbrella, i said i would.

He refused to eat anything from the plan and would order something extravagant for breakfast lunch and dinner. When we checked out his meals alone were over $2000, this was back in 1984.  His meals cost more than the hotel & flights.  He then told me i was responsible to for paying it because i ruin the trip by wanting to go to the beach.\n\nI stayed married another 8 yrs hoping that he would become less selfish less contrarian but surprise, he did not.

I bet he has hobbies and interests, the vast majority of us do. But OP just wants to use mostly negative things to describe him. Does OP even know their own sibling very well? \n\nThis is just too one sided.  Would love to hear from the sibling and see what they say.  Maybe the sibling really is a one dimensional character who is just a nag...but I doubt it. Probably a person built through years of experiences and emotions like the rest of us.

That was the only one I look back on fondly. Its not just about the one dinner at a restaurant. Its about not having to tip toe in the morning to not wake someone who gets cranky if he cant sleep in. Its about not being guilt tripped for not changing other parts of the itinerary because Tom is back at the cabin alone. Its about the whole freaking vibe of the trip being everyone having fun enjoying the same activities that they all like *or* nobody really being that happy because they're all trying to compromise.\n\n This family is young, Tom can be proactive in trying to plan a trip to his liking in the future. Vacation time is limited, OP and his siblings should be able to do a trip that they all want to do without compromising it or being guilt tripped. Tom is 22, he still has some growing up to do. Being excluded from this could make him look in the mirror and have a moment of self reflection for the better.\n\n Im done responding now, this got me fired up because I grew up with a brother like Tom who fortunately has grown up quite a bit since. But growing up with him made all of our lives worse for awhile. I get a little \"triggered\" when I see other people insisting people sacrifice their own enjoyment to deal with the Tom types.", "They already said they are going to cook something when they get back and crash because they have a packed schedule. It's also not in the budget to eat out.", "It's possible to be upset, and wrong.\n\nIf a group like to get together to do something, a person who doesn't like that doesn't get veto power just by virtue of being somehow associated with the group.", "If the other one is free and you've already decided to pay for the eye, then no reason you can't do both time permitting.", "That does make me feel better!"]}
