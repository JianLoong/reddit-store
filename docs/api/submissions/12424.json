My sister and stepsister were both 13f and I was 14m. Dad went MIA when my sister and I were babies. Mom's had a few relationships since then but Jason is the first husband she's had. Jason's daughter is Rylee. Rylee's mom abandoned her when she was a baby too. Her mom died at some point but she only found in November. She'd never met her mom but it was hard on her.\n\nEver since Rylee found out her mom was dead, my mom has been trying to get her more friends in school. She's friends outside of school. But none actually in school. She wanted my sister to invite Rylee into her friendship group and my sister said no. Rylee and my sister do not like each other. From the first time we met her the two of them have had their issues. It bothers mom that my sister won't let it drop. It's started to get seriously tense between my mom and my sister. Mostly because my sister was hanging out with her friends one day and mom asked them if Rylee could join in (this was outside of school) and my sister's friends said no since Rylee isn't their friend and because my sister doesn't like her. Mom said my sister didn't mind. My sister said she did mind and she would rather stay alone in her room than hang out with Rylee. Mom told her she was turning into a real bully and Rylee was her sister and she should be trying to help her through her difficult time. My sister told mom they didn't like each other and didn't care about each other, so why would either of them want to help the other.\n\nWhen my sister and I still hung out together after that incident, mom pulled me up and said I should be blasting my sister and including Rylee more. That I should be showing Rylee that loyalty I show my sister. I laughed and asked her why she thought I had loyalty for Rylee. Mom said of course I do, because we're family and she's my younger sister now and how could I not be loyal to her? That I have always been loyal to my sister. I told mom because my sister and I are siblings, close siblings, as well as friends, and I love her. That I don't have to be loyal to Rylee just because I'm loyal to my sister. I told her Rylee might be like a daughter to her now but she's not like a sister to me. She told me I was saying horrible things and I should be better than this. I told her to ask Rylee if she's an only child or has siblings. Mom said Rylee would of course answer that she has siblings. Newsflash: she doesn't but mom and Jason kinda too, like to ignore this and act like Rylee was so desperate to be siblings with us.\n\nMom told me I should be loyal to both sisters but especially to the one who needs me most right now (Rylee in her eyes). She told me I was not being a good big brother and I should be ashamed of myself for dismissing Rylee the way I do.\n\nAITA?\n\nETA: Adding some stuff I cut because my post was originally too long.\n\nRylee and her friends have said my sister is fat. Not to my sister's face but still in the house. I think that's what made her dislike or target my sister. She probably saw her as an easy target and expected her to be all meek and quiet because of her body shape. She doesn't really come for me at all but I have told her to leave my sister alone since hearing her and her friends say that about my sister. I know she hasn't stopped talking about my sister like that either. But I only heard it twice after the first time but I know from how her friends act that they talk shit like that a lot.\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1678965086, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11sr0p8/aita_for_telling_my_mom_i_dont_have_to_be_loyal/", "score": 740, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You could have simply told your mother that you don't want to get involved or take sides, but you basically told her that you couldn't care less about her. FFS, Rylee isn't asking for a kidney. She want to be loved. And if you can't manage that at least treat her nicely. Her mom is dead, so you and your family is the only family she has. And now her only family doesn't care about her?

Someone showing up and declaring themselves family because of a piece of paper is one of the primary issues that makes blending family difficult. Your step sister doesn't like your sister, and has from your description done little to bond with you either, so why would you have loyalty to her?\n\n>She told me I was not being a good big brother and I should be ashamed of myself for dismissing Rylee the way I do.\n\nNo, but your mother should be ashamed of **herself** for lying and manipulating as she is.\n\nNTA", "NTA, sounds like your mom, step dad and step sister are though.", "NTA you are a *great* big brother.", "Mom and step dad chose each other. You did not choose a step sister. All that is required is some civility or a little effort to peacefully co-exist i.e. at the dinner table but friendship or loyalty is not required, especially if she is a bully. NTA", "NTA\n\nBased on your edit, not only do they not get along, but Rylee actively attempts to bully your sister. Stepchildren should never be forced to get along but especially in a case like that.", "NTA you and your sister are not obliged to be friendly with her, if Rylee wants to be included so badly she can say so and try to herself.", "Y'all sound a little miserable...  NTA", "NTA - tell your mom she\u2019s only being loyal to herself trying to please Jason. She\u2019s a coward that should be sticking up for her daughter especially after the edit.", "NTA, there's a story up here similar to yours. The only difference was that the dad died. mom forced his side to take her stepson in order to see op & his sister. When OP & his sister were old enough, they dipped. When his mom came to see him, at his job, he told  his mom she only had 1 kid. That's going to be your your mom. There are a lot of stories parents doing this, then cry when their kids want nothing to do with them.", "INFO: Is your sister actively targeting Rylee and bullying her at school? Or just not going out of her way to help her?\n\nIt's obvious they're fighting at home, but it's also weird that Rylee has plenty of friends outside of school and not a single one in school unless someone/something is actively blocking that.", "NTA - advise your mom she decided to get married, not you and she can't force a relationship because she made that decision.", "NTA  \n\n\nI walked into HS my first day. This girl Mary and I just locked eyes from across the room and immediately, and for no reason, we hated each other. It's visceral and mutual and we both admit it's for no explainable reason at all.   \n\n\nWe ended up having a mutual friend at the HS. In college we both needed a roommate. We decided if we both liked the mutual friend, and have similar interests, we should be adults and push through this weird unspoken hatred which made no sense. Better to room with someone you KNOW than a complete stranger that the school assigned to you was our thinking.   \n\n\nYeah no.   \nIt ended TERRIBLY.   \n\n\nYou can not force these things.", "NTA", "I don\u2019t know how old you are, but trust me: if you don\u2019t act like this person is your sister now, both she and your Mother will hold it against you for the rest of your life. It\u2019s simply not work fighting over. She lost her mom and needs help. YTA", "NTA.  They're trying to force a relationship that Rylee doesn't even seem to want herself.  Just keep  your head down and try to ignore her until you turn 18. Then you can go LC if you need to.", "NTA I wish more parents would understand that forcing unwanted feelings and relationships onto kids is only going to make the situation worse. You don't have to like your stepsister but I bet if your mom left y'all alone you'd eventually figure out how to coexist with one another. I bet none of you want to be at constant odds with one another or fighting and by letting you work it out amongst yourselves you'd come to a conclusion of how to cope with the situation much quicker.\n\nSide story: a friend of my mom's remarried after her first husband passed away. Combined her and her new husband had 5 kids. All but 1 were teenagers. The kids hated each other at first especially his younger son and her daughter. My mom's friend and her husband had the attitude of this isn't perfect but deal with it and work out your issues. They've been married over 20 years now and all the kids have managed to forge their own way into relationships or at least civil coexistance with one another because they weren't forced to be siblings with each other for the sake of \"family.\" And yes the kids were all considred and talked to before getting married and all were ok with the marriage but that didn't automatically mean they were ok with each other.", "Nta\n\nYour mom is trying to force a relationship that isn't there, and all she's going to accomplish is making it worse.", "NTA", "NTA. You're a great big brother!", "Agreed. Honestly, they were selfish for getting married when they did. In their situation, you either: 1) wait until the potential family dynamic is good OR 2) Be willing to accept it for what it is. Never force the kids to do something they don\u2019t want to or invalidate their feelings.", "It sounds like mom wants to help Rylee but doesn\u2019t actually want to do anything to help her and instead is trying to force her kids to do the work for her. Rylee needs to learn not to bully people, and her parents should be raking her over the coals for her disparaging comments about OP\u2019s sister, not trying to force them together.", "Ah yes, the Reddit classic. \n\nParents are AHs for remarrying", "honestly even before the edit went up, this response wasn't it. OP's mother is the one that brought up loyalty. it's not at all out of pocket to respond to somebody on the topic that they've brought up into conversation.\n\nit's on the same level of berating somebody for airing 'dirty laundry' in public when it's the other party that forced the conversation in the first place *in* a public place.", "No, the parents are TA for trying to force a sibling bond on kids who don't want it.", "Ah yes, the Reddit classic.\n\nFailing to understand the post you are responding to.", "No, they aren\u2019t for simply remarrying. But they are for doing so with unrealistic expectations for the children. \nThe kids may not be ok with it. Sure, they can just tell the kid \u201ctough luck\u201d, but they better not come whinging here in a year when the kid is making the household unbearable or wants to live with the other parent or grandma; or in 10 when the grown kid doesn\u2019t want the stepparent/step siblings at the wedding or to see the grands, OR doesn\u2019t talk to the parent at all. If they could have just put off the wedding until the dynamic improved, of course I would not pity them. Adults should know how to delay gratification to get a better result.", "But the OP is not wrong.", "Even pre edit, I'm not sure why OP should have loyalty", "Heck sibling relationships can\u2019t be forced. I have nothing in common with my sister and never did. The more my Mom pushed the relationship the worse it became because nothing in common! My Mom lives in a fantasy world where if we try harder and Mom pushes enough we will be best friends. Your Mom is welcome to join my mom in fantasy land. They are single minded and there way us best, ignore , don\u2019t engage, and once in college avoiding step sibling will be easier.", "Agreed!!", "NTA. She's a step, not a real sibling unless you choose to recognize her as such. Your loyalty should be to your real sister.", "NTA but your mom is big time. You can\u2019t put 2 kids together And tell them to be friends.", "NTA, your mom is forcing a relationship onto both of you and it\u2019s not fair. You are not responsible for Rylee.", "NTA. Parents in blended families need to stop acting like the kids are all siblings when they've only known each other a couple of years...", "NTA someone tell your mom 'the brady bunch' wasn't a documentary and she can't force a family together. point out the nasty stuff rylee does and then tell mom  I'm showing loyaty to my sister.'", "NTA\nYour mother might think she has three children, but you only have One sister.\n\nAnd with both how Rylee behaves and your mothers pressure that\u2019s not likely to change.", "Have you told your mother how Rylee behaves to your sister? Because it sounds like Rylee doesn't want to hang out with her either.", "NTA. Your mom wants a unified family but is going about it incorrectly. She also should have dealt with Rylee trying to bully your sister when it first happened.", "NTA.... Your mom and SF are the ones with the responsibility here. They should have made sure you all got along before moving you in together. Forcing a relationship will not work!", "NTA\n\nYour sister is old enough to decide for herself who she wants in her life. As are you.\n\nIt is NOT your job to find friend for Rhylee. Apparently she has friends who bully your sister.\n\nWHY would your mother dismiss your concerns in favor of her stepchild OVER her own children.\n\nYour mother wants to blend a family where BOTH sides don't want to be blended. She can't FORCE people to like/love each other that only breeds resentment on both sides.\n\nWhich goes to show you that your mother is ONLY concerns with what SHE wants.\n\nNTA", "NTA", "NTA\n\nSorry for your family situation.\n\nSomeone needs to protect your sister from your Mom bullying her.", "NTA. \n\nAsk your mom what she is doing about your stepsister bullying your sister/calling her names? If you are all \"family\" why has she not been punished and forced to apologize for what she did? I wouldn't get away with calling my sister names growing up. \n\nBe clear with your mom- if she wants everyone to get along, then she needs to hold EVERYONE accountable. She also needs to give people space- my sister and I didn't always get along or share the same friends, and we were given space for that. \n\nAnd your mom needs to understand that her pushing you all together only makes it worse. SHE can plan family activities- after Rylee apologizes- and SHE can do the work of helping you all find common ground and do stuff together, and that is how you build a relationship.", "Nta. Seems like Rylee is the bully and you should tell your mum this.", "NTA \n\nI would suggest therapy for step sister if mom is so worried about her.", "NTA, your Mom needs to learn how to be a Mom apparently and learn to address problem herself instead of making you her little assistant. Happened to my Fiance and now her Mom and sister can't have a civil conversation without fiance arbitrating its ridiculous.", "NTA\n\nYour mom is the one acting like a bully. Did she at least reprimended Rylee for the way she treated your sister? What is your stepdad's position?\nBut regardless, relationships cannot be forced and your mom is not only make it hard for you three to bond, she is weakening the mother-children bond you have. How can you two trust her now, if she us against you?\nPeharps you and your sister should sit with her to talk about how this make you feel, though I don't have much faith in her response.", "NTA. Honestly you don't have to have loyalty to anyone but yourself. It's good that you are sticking up for your real sister, given your step sister is making fun of her behind her back, but your mom needs to quit trying to force a relationship, because that will only add to the resentment.", "And th y should be told that Riley's friends say cruel things to/about your sister when they come by. She is not innocent. I don't know what adults think if the are f*ing someone and me be in together/marry the k D's become sink ng's. The kitchen D's are prisoners of the adult's choices.", "If anything, trying to force a relationship between the two is only going to increase the chances that one never forms.

Yikes. \n\nPlus ignoring the reality that *Rylee is bullying and fat shaming the sister*.", "Right!? \n\nAnd MOM is the bully... (as well as SS)\n\nNTA", "Seriously? Ever thought there might be some love involved?", "I love this. Finally someone on Reddit who talks some sense. Well there was one other.

Just because your mum loves your stepsister\u2019s dad, that does not make her your sister. See how it\u2019s still the same point?", "I think...  the kids become siblings.

I do think in this case OP\u2019s parents had unreasonable expectations. \n\nBut and a big but, if you wait forever until the kids are okay with everything, you are going to die waiting. \n\nNobody likes change. And people will seek the status quo if you give them half a chance. \n\nThe parents are fine to remarry and to tell the kids deal and to try to build up familial bonds. The teenagers are fine to not be interested in it, but they are probably being immature", "Autocorrect strikes again!\n\nThat makes a lot more sense thanks."]}
