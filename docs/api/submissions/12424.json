My sister and stepsister were both 13f and I was 14m. Dad went MIA when my sister and I were babies. Mom's had a few relationships since then but Jason is the first husband she's had. Jason's daughter is Rylee. Rylee's mom abandoned her when she was a baby too. Her mom died at some point but she only found in November. She'd never met her mom but it was hard on her.\n\nEver since Rylee found out her mom was dead, my mom has been trying to get her more friends in school. She's friends outside of school. But none actually in school. She wanted my sister to invite Rylee into her friendship group and my sister said no. Rylee and my sister do not like each other. From the first time we met her the two of them have had their issues. It bothers mom that my sister won't let it drop. It's started to get seriously tense between my mom and my sister. Mostly because my sister was hanging out with her friends one day and mom asked them if Rylee could join in (this was outside of school) and my sister's friends said no since Rylee isn't their friend and because my sister doesn't like her. Mom said my sister didn't mind. My sister said she did mind and she would rather stay alone in her room than hang out with Rylee. Mom told her she was turning into a real bully and Rylee was her sister and she should be trying to help her through her difficult time. My sister told mom they didn't like each other and didn't care about each other, so why would either of them want to help the other.\n\nWhen my sister and I still hung out together after that incident, mom pulled me up and said I should be blasting my sister and including Rylee more. That I should be showing Rylee that loyalty I show my sister. I laughed and asked her why she thought I had loyalty for Rylee. Mom said of course I do, because we're family and she's my younger sister now and how could I not be loyal to her? That I have always been loyal to my sister. I told mom because my sister and I are siblings, close siblings, as well as friends, and I love her. That I don't have to be loyal to Rylee just because I'm loyal to my sister. I told her Rylee might be like a daughter to her now but she's not like a sister to me. She told me I was saying horrible things and I should be better than this. I told her to ask Rylee if she's an only child or has siblings. Mom said Rylee would of course answer that she has siblings. Newsflash: she doesn't but mom and Jason kinda too, like to ignore this and act like Rylee was so desperate to be siblings with us.\n\nMom told me I should be loyal to both sisters but especially to the one who needs me most right now (Rylee in her eyes). She told me I was not being a good big brother and I should be ashamed of myself for dismissing Rylee the way I do.\n\nAITA?\n\nETA: Adding some stuff I cut because my post was originally too long.\n\nRylee and her friends have said my sister is fat. Not to my sister's face but still in the house. I think that's what made her dislike or target my sister. She probably saw her as an easy target and expected her to be all meek and quiet because of her body shape. She doesn't really come for me at all but I have told her to leave my sister alone since hearing her and her friends say that about my sister. I know she hasn't stopped talking about my sister like that either. But I only heard it twice after the first time but I know from how her friends act that they talk shit like that a lot.\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1678965086, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11sr0p8/aita_for_telling_my_mom_i_dont_have_to_be_loyal/", "score": 2064, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You could have simply told your mother that you don't want to get involved or take sides, but you basically told her that you couldn't care less about her. FFS, Rylee isn't asking for a kidney. She want to be loved. And if you can't manage that at least treat her nicely. Her mom is dead, so you and your family is the only family she has. And now her only family doesn't care about her?

You should not be dragged into this shit plain and simple.", "I would straight up call mom and Rylee out for bullying and harassing y\u2019all and bullying seems to be the reason why the girl is a loner at school", "NTA your mom needs to accept that you will not all be best friends, the best she can hope for is to coexist peacefully", "NTA.  Your mother needs to understand that she cannot force a relationship like this.  The three of you (you, your sister, and Rylee) should all at least be polite to one another and act like civilized human beings, but no one can force you to love one another like siblings.", "Yeah, it seems SO many parents have this Brady Bunch fantasy when it comes to blended families- that everyone will happily get along together with the obligatory laugh track in the background. Then they are shocked and angry when the kids are like \"Lol. Nope\"", "Shouldn\u2019t the stepsister also be kind and have empathy considering she\u2019s a bully in and out of school? Her mom dying is not an excuse to be an asshat , if anything she\u2019s alienating herself , ppl don\u2019t want to hang out with bullies and ppl who constantly pick fights with them . OP and his sister have a right to protect their sanity and friendships", "And that is a them problem. You can\u2019t force someone to be siblings or act like one. Begin a siblings imply love, and that can\u2019t be forced maybe faked.", "Mom seems like a bully aswell", "OP never mentioned step sis was a bully in or out of school, only that she made an off hand comment about sis weight. I would bet my bottom dollar sis has made comments about step sis that OP omitted due to his close relationship.  \n\nWhen people are going through trauma, especially teenagers who are also battling hormones, I\u2019m not expecting them to make rational decisions or wise judgements. \n\nIm telling OP to look at the entire scenario, realize step sis probably going through some trauma which has helped fuel her decisions. Be smarter, extend an olive branch & see what happens.", "It\u2019s overall just real sad for OP and their sister. Home cannot be a fun environment", "NTA. And after reading your update I think it's safe to say that the only bully here is Rylee.", "Nta. Just be polite.", "NTA. tell your mom that if she continues this behaviour then in future rylee would be the only child she has and that she would lose her own 2 children", "Making comments about ppls weight and picking at them is being a bully no matter what they\u2019re going through , she may have the trauma of her mom dying but she\u2019s making the conscious decision to be a d!ck and wonder why no one wants to be around her , trauma doesn\u2019t give you an excuse to dump it on ppl and be a bully", "NTA!  Rylee is a bully and instead of forcing your sister to hang out with her, your mom should be finding out why.  If your mom is okay with Rylee commenting on your sister\u2019s weight, then she is the real problem.  Mean girl behavior is prevalent in adults just as in teen girls and it seems like your mom might need to be told what is going on and see what her reaction is.", "NTA. These parents are trying waaaay too hard to have the perfect little blended family. It can't be forced. \n\nBased on your edit both the parents and Rylee are the AHs. Keep standing up for your sister; you're doing the right thing.", "NTA\u2014if one of my daughters refuses friendship with another child, step sibling or not.. then I, as having been a good parent that raised them to be respectful of children that are the targets of bullies and to stand up for themselves and to have empathy and compassion.. it\u2019s my job to do that. If, having known I raised them with these qualities like I have.. They meet another child and do not like them or refuse to be friends with them.. then I know that there is a reason and I would look into it and ask my daughters. They are genuinely good human beings and if they refuse, they have good reason and I will stand behind them. Once in a great while my younger one needs a reminder that we must be kind as we don\u2019t know their home life but she\u2019s making these mistaken assumptions few and far between and hears me out. Inevitably changes her mind in the rare occasion she is met with a new moral choice. I trust both of their judgement at this point. And would stand behind them. If you cannot trust their choices on something like this, you failed somewhere. You will never FORCE a friendship or bond. Never.", "Wow. if your mother is that desperate for your stepsister to have friends... join a hobby or a club.", "NTA NTA NTA, you don't have to accommodate to her or be kind to her at all, especially if she can't reciprocate. Respect goes both ways.", "NTA. It's unfair of your mom to put this on you and your sister.", "NTA Your mom should be rethinking her idea of family. She married someone with a kid and that does not automatically make you a family. Your step sister is bullying your sister maybe you mom should put a stop to that instead of demanding loyalty for someone who does not deserve it. Does your mom know your stepsister is calling your sister fat? Because until that is addressed head on nothing is going to change!", "NTA", "Your mum clearly wants everyone to be happy families but obviously you guys don't feel like one family but almost two, which is natural given the circumstances and ages. Definitely NTA but have some consideration for your mum and where she's coming from, it's from a place of love", "Irrespective of Rylee's nasty comments, your mother trying to force your sister and her step-daughter together is a huge mistake. Great way to build hostility and resentment.\n\nI can't think why Rylee has few friends if she makes comments about people's appearance.... NTA.", "NTA\n\nYour situation? Is why so many blended families fail. The parents that are afraid of loneliness ignore every sign that the kids don\u2019t like each other, and want a family structure so bad, they literally throw the kids that don\u2019t get along into the same house with this mindset that it will hopefully work out. And it doesn\u2019t. In fact, it\u2019s going to get worse, your house is going to be one big civil war until one of you turns 18.", "NTA. Why does the Brady Bunch make these people think that just putting step kids together will make them automatically \"bond\" and see those other steps as \"Family\" when their delusional parents decide they need to all *\"love each other like family\"* from the first second of living together.\"", "My dad has a friend who met his gf when they both had teenage kids. They decided not to live together because it would be difficult to meld the teenagers into a family due to ages and room and neither wanted to uproot the kids and move to a different house. It worked so well that 40 years later they are still together and still live separately and are both grandparents to each others grandkids.", "Okay, well done for asking for advice!\n\nMy 2 cents: Your mom seems to think Rylee is in the position of having less compared to you and your sister. But you all grew up with one parent each. She feels guilty about something? But it's Jason's job to deal with Rylee, or they work as a team. It's not her job to go it alone in trying to reorganise the way you're all relating.\n\nGo to the library and get your mom some books on blended families. Tell her that she (and Jason) has to read them and, after she's done, you want a family mediation session with a professional to set household rules and boundaries (and consequences), to help you all have a respectful household and easier life going forward.\n\nYou may not like each other much but hopefully you can learn to get along under the same roof."]}
