My sister and stepsister were both 13f and I was 14m. Dad went MIA when my sister and I were babies. Mom's had a few relationships since then but Jason is the first husband she's had. Jason's daughter is Rylee. Rylee's mom abandoned her when she was a baby too. Her mom died at some point but she only found in November. She'd never met her mom but it was hard on her.\n\nEver since Rylee found out her mom was dead, my mom has been trying to get her more friends in school. She's friends outside of school. But none actually in school. She wanted my sister to invite Rylee into her friendship group and my sister said no. Rylee and my sister do not like each other. From the first time we met her the two of them have had their issues. It bothers mom that my sister won't let it drop. It's started to get seriously tense between my mom and my sister. Mostly because my sister was hanging out with her friends one day and mom asked them if Rylee could join in (this was outside of school) and my sister's friends said no since Rylee isn't their friend and because my sister doesn't like her. Mom said my sister didn't mind. My sister said she did mind and she would rather stay alone in her room than hang out with Rylee. Mom told her she was turning into a real bully and Rylee was her sister and she should be trying to help her through her difficult time. My sister told mom they didn't like each other and didn't care about each other, so why would either of them want to help the other.\n\nWhen my sister and I still hung out together after that incident, mom pulled me up and said I should be blasting my sister and including Rylee more. That I should be showing Rylee that loyalty I show my sister. I laughed and asked her why she thought I had loyalty for Rylee. Mom said of course I do, because we're family and she's my younger sister now and how could I not be loyal to her? That I have always been loyal to my sister. I told mom because my sister and I are siblings, close siblings, as well as friends, and I love her. That I don't have to be loyal to Rylee just because I'm loyal to my sister. I told her Rylee might be like a daughter to her now but she's not like a sister to me. She told me I was saying horrible things and I should be better than this. I told her to ask Rylee if she's an only child or has siblings. Mom said Rylee would of course answer that she has siblings. Newsflash: she doesn't but mom and Jason kinda too, like to ignore this and act like Rylee was so desperate to be siblings with us.\n\nMom told me I should be loyal to both sisters but especially to the one who needs me most right now (Rylee in her eyes). She told me I was not being a good big brother and I should be ashamed of myself for dismissing Rylee the way I do.\n\nAITA?\n\nETA: Adding some stuff I cut because my post was originally too long.\n\nRylee and her friends have said my sister is fat. Not to my sister's face but still in the house. I think that's what made her dislike or target my sister. She probably saw her as an easy target and expected her to be all meek and quiet because of her body shape. She doesn't really come for me at all but I have told her to leave my sister alone since hearing her and her friends say that about my sister. I know she hasn't stopped talking about my sister like that either. But I only heard it twice after the first time but I know from how her friends act that they talk shit like that a lot.\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1678965086, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11sr0p8/aita_for_telling_my_mom_i_dont_have_to_be_loyal/", "score": 69, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Effort/bonding is a two-way street. \n\nIf your sister feels strongly about Rylee then your mum needs to take into account how your sister feels. Forcing her to do things will never work to create a bond. It will only make your sister feel she is being disregarded in favour Rylee...\n\nMum needs to see it from your sister's perspective, I would find it very hard to live with a girl who called me fat behind my back and seemed to openly dislike me. And yes, her friends outside of the home could be her positive outlet/safe space. This should be protected. \n\nMy only comment would be, that you all have to live under one roof- if you think a counselling session between all of you could help to at least build some bridges, possibly proposing it would be a good idea (at the mothers expense would be beneficial.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n  Did Rylee when you first all became a unit try to bond with you both in anyway?", "This is easy.

Like, shocker, it didn\u2019t work that way. \n\nIf they want to make this work, rather than trying to smash a Mega Block into a row of Legos, they should have the entire family in therapy.

It's ludicrous to imagine that your relationship with your step sister would be the same as with your bio sister after such little time.\n\nIt doesn't sound like Rylee wants this either, so I think this isnone best put down to \"parents get weird ideas about living up to perfect familynexpectations\".", "NTA. You can't force friendships. Loyalty is earned through people's behaviour. Someone's mom marrying a dad, doesn't automatically create loyalty between stepsiblings.

Now that OP has edited that Rylee has been trashing his sister, I am a hell of a lot less sympathetic. OP's statement now makes a hell of a lot more sense. \n\nOriginal response:\n\nI don't know why your sister and Rylee have beef, it may be legitimate, but you are just super cold towards someone living in your home and who obviously is feeling bad about this whole situation. You could have simply told your mother that you don't want to get involved or take sides, but you basically told her that you couldn't care less about her. FFS, Rylee isn't asking for a kidney. She want to be loved. And if you can't manage that at least treat her nicely. Her mom is dead, so you and your family is the only family she has. And now her only family doesn't care about her? How the hell would you feel in that situation??\n\nYou were fine not defending Rylee against your sister and you both don't have to hang out, but you should be more sensitive when talking about it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
