My husband's side of the family has a lot of children and this story involves my daughter (10f) and her cousin (11f). My daughter has a few learning disabilities but is a normal kid. Her cousin has similar disabilities but with a penchant for anger and has been aggressively bullying my daughter for the past 5 or so years. \n\nHighlights include pushing her over a week after she had surgery because she wasnt moving fast enough, calling her names like stupid, fat, ugly ass bitch, etc. Poking at her until she starts to cry and then skipping away in triumph. The list goes on and on.\n\nUnfortunately, I am the only one in that family that sees and issue with it. to make matters worse, my SIL has made it clear the only one who can yell or parent her kid, would be her or her husband, which has done nothing short of galvanizing my nieces attitude that we can't yell at her or get her in trouble. Which in turn, makes her more bold with her bullying.\n\nOn to the story.\n\nWe were sitting around my in laws house after one of the nephews has been baptized. Everything is as normal as one could expect. My daughter is quietly playing with legos and she starts getting upset asking her cousin multiple times to be left alone. I know she has been overly tired from a birthday party the night before and admittedly was a bit on the cranky side, so I stepped in. Grabbed my daughter and walked into the next room to let her know that it is okay to be frustrated but this is a situation we cannot control and we should learn to move forward and deal with it to the best of our abilities. \n\nIt was in this moment that my sister in-law stepped in and asked what is going on. My husband was trying to inform my sister in-law of what happened and she stopped that conversation to make a passive aggressive comment about how I am trying to parent her child.\n\nIt is at this point that I saw red and let my anger get the best of me. Maybe it was 5 years of inaction on her part to stop this situation, maybe it was the history of passive aggressive comments she has made but I lost it. Swore a lot, called her out on her horrific parenting, told her she is full of shit if she thinks she is going to be allowed to play the martyr and ultimately, if she wants to continue to fuck around, she will find out.\n\nAfter 15 minutes of me reaming her out she stated that I have humiliated her in front of her kids and my response before leaving was \"It was nothing short of deserved.\"\n\nNow I am being pressured by my husbands family to apologize and make amends which is something I am not wanting to do in the absolute slightest.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith all of that said, Reddit, AITA?", "created_utc": 1675280210, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10r3tcx/aita_for_screaming_at_my_sil_at_a_party/", "score": 80, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The fact that SIL is making comments about your parenting, yet not letting anyone address hers is ridiculous.  She finally learned what happens when you keep pushing someone's buttons, thinking you somehow have the moral high ground.\n\nChildren learn a lot from their parents.  I've seen it first hand with my toddler (picking up things from me I wish he hadn't).  Sounds like the cousin has learned quite a bit from her mom, and thinks she's untouchable.  Honestly, when a parent says no one but them are allowed to discipline their child, most times... the child in question turns out to be a nightmare.\n\n**NTA**  And if that little brat continues to be an issue, then I'd seriously start breaking that \"no disciplining\" rule and tell SIL if she doesn't want others to discipline her child, then she needs to step up and do it herself.", "NTA for giving her her due; but why haven\u2019t you tried to keep the cousin away from your daughter? LC or NC if necessary? Isn\u2019t there SOMETHING you can do to keep your daughter from having to be around someone who according to you has been aggressively bullying and assaulting your daughter for 5 YEARS???", "NTA. She had it coming. Kudos for defending your daughter.", "ESH, but YTA for continuing to bring your daughter to events *for FIVE ENTIRE YEARS* where her bully is present and doing nothing about it. How about protecting your kid instead?\n\nThe fact that it took you five years to actually consider doing something for your daughter is very alarming. Stop taking your kid to events where her bully will be!", "NTA but this is what happens when you let anger get pent up. You end up going apeshit at an event that kids have to witness. I get it though, she really deserved it.", "NTA- I would explain since SIL didn't want her child to be disciplined by anyone else when she is doing something wrong, and that since SIL won't discipline her child then you had to do the next best thing and discipline the SIL. You and your daughter have been putting up with this for 5 years. It is time that things changed.", "NTA.\n\nYou've already tolerated an entire lot of disrespect already, and tried to make things cohesive between the two kids by talking to her parents. They refused, and won't fix it.\n\nRemoving your daughter from the situation and only talking to her about how to handle something like this was nowhere near you 'trying to parent' your niece, and the level of entitlement from your SIL is downright infuriating. If she doesn't fix that, her child's in for a world of hurt, either from her or at her. And mom's on the hook for things the kid does until legal adulthood at minimum.\n\nThe fact that your SIL doesn't see some of the hateful name-calling as meriting some discipline alone is telling. I wouldn't be bringing my kid back there at all until something's done.\n\nWhere's your husband on this, by the way? Why is he letting his daughter suffer at the hands of anyone, let alone family?", "ESH\n\nYou have every right to stand up for your child, and if that involves admonishing her kid, then you should stand your ground. \n\nBut maybe next time don't let your anger build for 5 years before speaking your mind so that it doesn't turn into this massive blow up?", "I say ride out that anger until there is nothing left. Exhaust is completely. Be pissed off. Then, slowly slowly it\u2019ll blow over and pass. SIL will hopefully know better than to mess with you in the future. Reddit hates screaming and lashing out, but it was probably healthy for you. NTA", "NTA. You handled the situation with your daughter beautifully! Took her aside, affirmed her feelings, basically showed her you are on her side and she's not alone - that you are there and will protect her. Beautiful parenting!\n\nThen your SIL comes in and accuses you of trying to parent her daughter?  Not sure how she got that from the interaction as you were clearly speaking with your child, not hers. Wow!\n\nHonestly, she did deserve it.  You are NTA here.", "NTA at all. Say you're not going to do anything until your SIL apologizes, why should you make the first move?", "why should you apologize for her lack of skills?  \n\n\nif what you say is true, nta", "NTA. Your SIL and her shit parenting set this in motion, she can fuck off.", "NTA\n\nIf I'm understanding, you took your daughter aside and spoke with her when she became upset. How is that parenting your niece? This situation shouldn't have gone on as long as it did. Cursing in front of children wasn't the best play either, but the real problem was that you bottled it so long. Your call if you want to apologize or not. If everyone thinks the way your daughter is being treated by her cousin is acceptable, it might be in her best interests to restrict interactions with that side of the family for a while.", "NTA because you did this, YTA because you should have done this years ago.", "> but this is a situation we cannot control\n\nBullshit. You pick up your child and leave\n\n>5 years of inaction on her part to stop this situation\n\nWhat about the 5 years of inaction on your part? It's not her job to protect your child from torment, it's YOURS.\n\nYTA for letting your daughter get bullied for so long.", "NTA. \\*Slow golf clap\\* Great momming on your part. I especially liked the 'if she wants to continue to fuck around, she will find out'\n\nI PINKY PROMISE you, you made your daughters heart feel all warm and loved and protected that day!", "NTA. Has your SIL's daughter been assessed for Fetal Alcohol Syndrome? Is she getting structured help from a professional? This situation will in the end have a large negative impact on both the child and her parents, if they are one day dealing with an adult who cannot control her outbursts and create a productive life for herself.", "NTA", "I really want to say Y T A but honestly, the only reason your daughter had been exposed to this bully is because YOU ALLOWED HER TO BE. If you had been seriously protecting your daughter, as soon as it was clear that your niece would not be restrained from her behaviour, you would have made damn sure it couldn't happen, family or not. So ESH, very much including you OP.", "NTA. If I understand your story correctly SIL\u2019s child was as usual bothering yours. Your SIL did not parent, correct her child\u2019s behavior so you yelled at her. \n\nYes, she deserved being humiliated for that. Do not apologize or make amends. Tell everyone that you will always defend, protect your child. Period. And that their willingness to let SIL\u2019s child grow up as a bully is just sad.", "Ah, it looks like it's time for the time honored, \"I'm sorry for losing my temper and raising my voice.\" apology. That at once is an apology and also... doesn't mean you're appologizing for a single thing you said. lol\n\nGive a placating apology just to shut her up you're not gonna win with turd heads like SIL. Just like you told your daughter\n\n>this is a situation we cannot control and we should learn to move forward and deal with it to the best of our abilities.\n\nNTA. but you're going to have to be diplomatic cause it's stupid heckin' family... ugh.", "NTA, everyone has their breaking point and you reached yours. Most people aren\u2019t going to stand by and watch their child be bullied, or be disrespected by the bully\u2019s parent in the process. \n\nSure, it was wrong to lash out at your SIL so publicly (I\u2019m sure she was humiliated), but don\u2019t dish it if you can\u2019t take it. Also, if you don\u2019t want to apologize\u2026.don\u2019t\u2026a half ass \u201cI apologize you felt that way\u201d might do the trick.", "ESH you've allowed your child to be abused for 5 years.
