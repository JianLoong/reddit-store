Someone in my town did this and their car got stolen with the baby inside.", "NTA, this is an absolute dealbreaker. Leaving the child alone in the car is neglect.", "NTA. It\u2019s not only unsafe, it\u2019s illegal in some places. I watched a mom get arrested for leaving her child sleeping in the car while she picked up her older kid from school. \n\nIf he needs a coffee, he needs to find a place with a drive through.", "NTA. I don\u2019t even leave my dog outside the coffee shop.", "NTA\n\nYour husband is being naive if he thinks it's OK to leave a child in the car unattended, even for a short while. Lots of accounts of cars being stolen from a garage forecourt while a parent pays for petrol and kids being taken too. It's an avoidable issue and, while an inconvenience for him, his child is worth so much more than a cup of coffee to him. \n\nHe may not like it but you're not wrong. Be good to find common ground though so he doesn't feel he has to butt heads or stand down: maybe agreement that you both value your child equally - it's possible he is just unaware of the potential for harm.", "NTA. I\u2019m not a parent but I would never leave any child in a car alone for any amount of time. Even when I would have my nieces or nephews and needed gas I would roll the window down half way on the side I was on, lock the car and and have my keys tightly in my hand. I hated getting gas with them with me. Ugh. Terrified me.", "NTA\n\nI won\u2019t even leave my dog alone in a car. \n\nWhat if he got hit in the head and knocked unconscious?Wakes up in the hospital 3 hours later? If it\u2019s hot out your kid could be dead. \n\nOr what if the line is just really long? Kids in cars alone are bad on so many levels. I just can\u2019t with this guy. \n\nIf the police saw it you two could be facing a CPS investigation. Does foster care for your child sound fun??\n\nHold your ground on this. You\u2019re not wrong. He needs to stop and think about what COULD HAVE HAPPENED instead of what did. \n\nA big part of being a parent is trying to anticipate bad outcomes and avoiding them.", "You're NTA. Maybe he planned for it to be 90 seconds. What if something had happened? What if he had a medical problem while he was away from the car? What if the store had been held up? Where I live, unattended children left in cars have had tragic results. It takes very little time for the temperature in a locked car to rapidly rise.\n\nEven if nothing like that happened, it takes less than 90 seconds to steal an unattended child from a car.", "[removed]", "NTA! It is not safe to leave a toddler alone in a car. It is also illegal to do so in most states.", "NTA. There\u2019s a reason everyone becomes so outraged when we see and hear about children left in unattended vehicles. Because it\u2019s reckless, irresponsible and selfish.", "NTA. He should not have left your child in the car, for a short time or not.", "NTA and pretty sure that is illegal.", "NTA, that is a very dangerous thing to do.", "it's called drive thru..", "NTA.  \n\nIt may seem over protective but it\u2019s better to err on the side of caution.   Neither of you could live with yourself if something bad happened.\n\nA three year old is also capable of getting out of their car seat which makes it even more dangerous.", "NTA, anything could have happened while he was getting his coffee. He was endangering your toddler on purpose. So what he locked the doors? Three year old's can unlock doors from seeing it done by adults. He's lucky someone didn't see him do that and report him for child endangerment or child neglect. You could be dealing with CPS, or an injured or missing child right now. I'd be livid. I wouldn't listen to his bs excuses either.", "NTA but your husband definitely is. Is he insane to leave a baby in a car? I wouldn't trust him again, especially in the summer!!!", "NTA", "Nta there so much bad things that could.of happend to your toddler becuae of this", "NTA ask him how he will explain himself to the police when somebody notices the kid left in the car alone? It's not 1970 anymore, you can't do that sort of shit.", "NTA! Maybe pull up and compile a list of child hot car deaths just from last year alone. If that doesn't scare him into never doing it again, I'd be doing some serious soul searching about the future", "NTA. There's far too many stories of babies and toddlers dying in cars when they have been left there.\n\nTo me, leaving you child on a car, is the same as leaving them home unattended. You wouldn't go out & leave your child home alone, so why leave them in a locked car?!", "NTA. Even if it really was 90 seconds, he could have been delayed a lot longer for ordinary reasons. Meanwhile, the car is getting colder or hotter, there's the reasons you mentioned or he could wake up to strangers forcing their way into the car to rescue the unattended child.", "NTA first it was longer than 90 seconds. Second, all it takes is for one person to call the police and he will likely end up arrested. CPS could also get involved, I\u2019d ask him if a cup of coffee is worth all that. What he\u2019s doing is dangerous.", "NTA. \n\nAlso, has he not heard of a little thing called a \u201cdrive through\u201d?", "Absolutely 100% NTA. Doesn't matter if it's a cloudy day at noon, there is no excuse for leaving a toddler/small child alone in a car for any amount of time. I wouldn't do that to my dog, let alone a kid.", "NTA. Children die alone in cars. It's not safe. And even if there's not a temperature risk, someone walking buy could see the kid and jump to action. \n\nYour DH could come back with his coffee to a crowd who has smashed windows to \"save\" the sleeping toddler. Cops will be called, CPS will be involved. DH could be mobbed by angry vigilantes.\n\nThis situation will go from sleepy coffee to 5 alarm fire in a minute flat.", "Absolutely NTA.\n\nPeople who are discovered leaving their children in the car unattended are arrested, ticketed, and CPS gets involved. In what fucking world are we still having a conversation about not leaving children unattended in the car?!", "You should call your local police station and ask if someone can explain the law to your husband. Then just hand him the phone.  NTA", "NTA\n\nIf you live in the US and a cop happens to notice, your kid is getting put into protective custody. If he didn\u2019t want to wake the kid up he should have just gone to a shop with a drive thru.", "Pretty sure this is illegal and CPS can take away your kids if someone witnesses this. I remember reading an article about something very similar ages ago where the mom had to fight in court over this for years. A split second decision that forever changed her life. \n\nhttps://www.salon.com/2014/06/03/the_day_i_left_my_son_in_the_car/", "NTA. Umm does he know he can get arrested for that?", "NTA. Your husband\u2019s thought process in that situation is so wrong! For him, 90 seconds is fast but there are so many possible bad things that could happen during that time frame. If he wanted coffee so bad, he could had used drive-thru instead. I hope he\u2019d realize his mistake and not repeat it anymore.", "Is this shit real? Your husband is an idiot\n\nSeriously this has to be fake", "NTA.", "NTA, you are not wrong. But i can of understand your husband at the same time, if it's or 2 minutes, i can understand why he didn't want to wake up your child. But it's probably because where you live too, here most people wouldn't find that disturbing to let a child 2 minutes in a car because they won't risk anything. So i guess if i was leaving in USA i will not do it too.", "NTA kids being taken with the car is very common here. I would start sending him articles.", "In the uk this can get the police involved and if they see it they will be making a report to social services for endangering your child. Heck if the police think you are completely out of sight you will be charged. Regardless of being charged once they have contacted social services there will be an investigate to determine whether you\u2019re fit to have your child or a danger to them.  They will go as far as contacting nurseries, schools maybe even babysitters and clubs your children are part of use for questioning.", "NTA. If the kid can\u2019t operate the car, turn the heat or ac on, roll the windows or get out of the vehicle on their own, they aren\u2019t old enough to be left alone in it. I was 8 when I was able to be left with the keys. That was 20 years ago so idk if I\u2019d trust an 8 year old in today\u2019s day and age.", "NTA. I crashed my parents car TWICE when they ran in to \u201cget something real quick\u201d", "NTA, because it\u2019s just dumb to leave a toddler in a car. It was likely way more than a minute and a half to get a coffee, first off. Even though a lot of what we hear about the dangers of leaving kids in cars is fear mongering, a lot isn\u2019t. Cars do get hella hot in about 3 minutes if it\u2019s warm out, they can get warm even on a cold day depending how they\u2019re parked. \n\nThat said, there\u2019s a ton of us Gen Xers who survived being left in cars for long periods as kids. And cars weren\u2019t built as temperature controlled back then. \n\nWith the exception of temperature related issues, social media has overplayed the risks of leaving kids in a car alone, but it doesn\u2019t change that it\u2019s risky in any case at 3!", "NTA. Does he not realize how many predators there are. Human trafficking. Etc.", "NTA. Aside from the theft issue, which happens a lot, even 90 seconds alone in the car can be dangerous to a small child.", "Nta. However, his parents might have done it when he was a kid, mine did.", "Nta.", "[removed]", "I\u2019m going with YTA here. Not because of the situation but the response you gave him.
