And she later said that as scary as it was inside there, all she could think was that if she'd left her baby in the car, the baby probably would have died because she couldn't get back out to her on a hot day.\n\nThat sounds dramatic, but it doesn't have to be that severe. People get stuck in lines or trip and get injured or whatever... A million things can keep you from getting back out to your car when you think you will.

Because I think the answers you get are going to depend a lot on the answer to that question. My initial response is NAH, but you may need to rethink your assessment of how risky some things are.\n\nFWIW, the stories one sees about children dying in cars almost uniformly involve parents who have had a disruption to their normal routine, and as a consequence didn't realize they had left a child in the car. Gene Weingarten wrote a heartbreaking story for the Washington Post about those parents. But that's not the case you raise, because your husband knew your child was in the car, and thus was able to assess the risks involved.\n\nAnd if the car was locked, it's not clear why you would fear that the car might be stolen with your child in it. There is a small chance that would happen, but ask yourself this: how often are locked cars stolen where you live, especially when the owner is a short distance from the locked car?\n\nI grew up in western Michigan (USA), and I spent a reasonably large amount of time in the 1970s sitting in an unlocked car waiting for one or the other of my parents to run an errand. Nothing bad ever happened to me. I now live in western Massachusetts, and a couple of years ago a visitor from a Scandinavian country was reported to the police because she had left child in a stroller outside a coffee shop for a few minutes while she waited for her coffee. From her perspective, it was normal to leave the child in the stroller in the open air. Whoever reported her apparently thought it was better to call the police than to just keep an eye on the kid in the stroller while mom got her coffee.\n\nI understand that it can be hard to assess risks when your child is involved, but I hope that you and your husband can calm things down and then have a good conversation about this issue. If you live somewhere where temperatures in cars rise quickly to a dangerous level, that's important to discuss. In any case, you should work out an agreement about what to do going forward. I hope you'l do so based on a realistic assessment of the risks involved, because every risk avoided also avoids the corresponding opportunity for a kid to grow.", "NTA.
