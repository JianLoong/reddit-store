I remember reading a story from a woman who was like 'I used to leave my babies in the car if I was going to be less than 5 minutes somewhere, but this one day I really felt like I needed to take them' and she took her baby into the bank with her. The bank got robbed and she was stuck in there for like seven hours during a stand-off. And she later said that as scary as it was inside there, all she could think was that if she'd left her baby in the car, the baby probably would have died because she couldn't get back out to her on a hot day.\n\nThat sounds dramatic, but it doesn't have to be that severe. People get stuck in lines or trip and get injured or whatever... A million things can keep you from getting back out to your car when you think you will. And yeah, it's not common, but why take the risk?", "Omg that\u2019s terrible \ud83d\ude22", "I read one years ago that haunts me. \nA two year old girl died of hyperthermia in a car, but not before she pulled all of her hair out in desperation", "Yeah it was really strange and sad", "So basically leaving your baby in a car unsupervised is a bad idea and illegal.", "He was, thankfully. Two women from the community actually tracked him down after turning in the carjacker.", "Wait what???", "Oh, thank goodness. Almost ruined my night. I'm glad both babies got out of their ordeal alive.", "Yep not long after he was recovered. It was SIDS", "Unfortunately shortly after one of the twins died in an accident \ud83d\ude13", "\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d oh no!"]}
