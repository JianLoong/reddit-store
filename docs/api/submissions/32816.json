It should never come with the idea of \"If you don't do this, you don't love me\" because that's manipulative as all get out, as well as it being something that's reciprocated, not just one person (based off of OP stating that the wife won't be making one for them).\n\nWife is definitely being entitled, and I'd be giving some serious thoughts towards demanding marriage counseling or couples therapy.

Maybe tell her that you don't mind which option she chooses for you, if that is true - but definitely don't let her fall further into that expectation that the holiday is for you to give and her to receive.  Also, you can make your own choices about what percentage of your Christmas budget is for presents for your wife.  Are there other family members who don't get much at this time of year who would appreciate being remembered? (Grandparents? Anyone newly divorced/separated?

What is bad is making this demand (!) on short notice, and demanding a specific and labor-intensive version of the gift beyond a reasonable budget.\n\nSome people also feel they need to receive material things to be happy in a relationship. She should have been upfront about that-and still, in a relationship like that, there are boundaries, budgets, standards for communication and an expectation of reciprocity. I'm a hard-core bill splitter in vanilla dating and a sugar baby for fun too, so I'm familiar with that entitlement to someone else's money while being an unpleasant bully. It'll get you nowhere fast, potentially shows some ugly character traits, and also shows how ignorantly and disdainfully one views their partner.\n\nThe worst of it, to me, is how she holds this over your head and involves her friends. That's so manipulative, would trample all of *my* boundaries, and it's not conducive to solving the issue of her not feeling valued. A gift not freely given won't make her feel loved-no shit! She needs to have an open conversation with you about the *real* issue and scrap the advent calendar talk until you've settled your clear problems in communication and bitterness. \n\nI can see how someone not feeling valued for ages with a bad gift-giver as a partner could flip their lid over an advent calendar suddenly, so I don't want to paint her as evil, but her behavior is seriously not okay.\n\nOP, you could become an AH if you return her gifts instead of seeking an open conversation or just leaving.

To do this justice, you need time. Also worth point out that it wasn't a demand, it was a truck load of gifts offered freely (it actually turned out to be forty some odd items total. So I created \"groupings\" for the 12 days of Christmas. It was expensive, but I factored in more and less costly items -- some were stocking stuffers and others things I thought my partner would really love. Spreading it out over the year made it more manageable financially.  Also, if my partner mentioned in passing something he was interested in and I saw that he didn't get it for himself, then that could easily be slipped into the rotation. It was so much fun! Had he asked me to do this, though, it would've taken all of the pleasure out of it. Also worth point out that he did NOT give me a boat-load of gifts that same year.

Also you don't necessarily have to individually wrap them all you could just get those bulk bags where its like 5 or 6 small bags for 2 or 3 bucks and then stick them each in a bag. I think she would have been grateful for that because you put in the effort rather than just vetoing it out because its a lot of work.

An advent calendar of memories of you guys, pictures, small that recall memories, etc. nothing costly. If you would do this and she is happy, it's a win.

Why didn't you sit together and talk it out? You have enough time for something, I am sure, so why not compromise? Why not going cheap but caring?

My dollar store has all of this, if you're lucky you can get some (fake) greenery or mini baubles to tie on to some of the gifts. May look more luxe than a premade kit!\n\n**Avoid perfume.** If you're hellbent on it there's MicroPerfumes, they do decanted samples of perfumes and constantly have sales. There are also sampler sets like the Maison Margiela Replica one (got it for around 30\u20ac and it's nice!) that could be split up between days. Be wary of fake perfumes via ebay!   \nMost skin care meant for the face like day/night creams, is very individual and expensive so I'd avoid that too. **Get nothing that needs to match her skin tone!** I'd also avoid facial peeling products.\n\n**Stuff worth getting for cheaper:** hand creams, sheet masks, foot masks, lip balms or glosses (the small rose-tinted Vaseline!), nail polishes, silky hair scrunchies (good for hair), tea or smoothies formulated with beauty goals in mind (sounds weird, I keep seeing regular tea brands make 'em though and I'd love to try them), reusable make up removal pads, beauty sponges. If she's a nail girlie try nail stickers.\n\nGo to grocery/regular drug stores for as much as you can with this, Sephora at least in my area is always more expensive.\n\nAdding **only 2-3 few big brand items** will get her the most bang for your buck. Get **travel sizes!** Stuff I've seen at sephora, for example: Better than sex mascara, laneige lip mask (very trendy and luxurious), fenty beauty lip glosses, shiseido lash curler.\n\n**Split up one purchase between days:** Lush is expensive but they have blocks of solid body wash (basically soap) that they can cut for you, I've unashamedly asked for a 2$ piece before. I'd say totally worth it to get 2-3 of those because Lush has intense scents she might like. You can also cut their bath bombs and use them for way more than one bath, if you look one that'd look as nice cut as it does in one piece (so a patterned bar rather than a santa face, for example), I'd recommend that.\n\nYou can do the same with sets of stuff, e.g. a set of scrunchies.", "No, and she wants nice things not a snack advent calendar.
