It should never come with the idea of \"If you don't do this, you don't love me\" because that's manipulative as all get out, as well as it being something that's reciprocated, not just one person (based off of OP stating that the wife won't be making one for them).\n\nWife is definitely being entitled, and I'd be giving some serious thoughts towards demanding marriage counseling or couples therapy.

If she wants the 24-25 small presents in a cute calendar instead of what you currently do, and the total cost can be the same or less, then I think next year you should attempt it although it will be more work.  Maybe tell her that you don't mind which option she chooses for you, if that is true - but definitely don't let her fall further into that expectation that the holiday is for you to give and her to receive.  Also, you can make your own choices about what percentage of your Christmas budget is for presents for your wife.

What is bad is making this demand (!) on short notice, and demanding a specific and labor-intensive version of the gift beyond a reasonable budget.\n\nSome people also feel they need to receive material things to be happy in a relationship. She should have been upfront about that-and still, in a relationship like that, there are boundaries, budgets, standards for communication and an expectation of reciprocity. I'm a hard-core bill splitter in vanilla dating and a sugar baby for fun too, so I'm familiar with that entitlement to someone else's money while being an unpleasant bully. It'll get you nowhere fast, potentially shows some ugly character traits, and also shows how ignorantly and disdainfully one views their partner.\n\nThe worst of it, to me, is how she holds this over your head and involves her friends. That's so manipulative, would trample all of *my* boundaries, and it's not conducive to solving the issue of her not feeling valued. A gift not freely given won't make her feel loved-no shit! She needs to have an open conversation with you about the *real* issue and scrap the advent calendar talk until you've settled your clear problems in communication and bitterness. \n\nI can see how someone not feeling valued for ages with a bad gift-giver as a partner could flip their lid over an advent calendar suddenly, so I don't want to paint her as evil, but her behavior is seriously not okay.\n\nOP, you could become an AH if you return her gifts instead of seeking an open conversation or just leaving.

To do this justice, you need time. Also worth point out that it wasn't a demand, it was a truck load of gifts offered freely (it actually turned out to be forty some odd items total. So I created \"groupings\" for the 12 days of Christmas. It was expensive, but I factored in more and less costly items -- some were stocking stuffers and others things I thought my partner would really love. Spreading it out over the year made it more manageable financially.  Also, if my partner mentioned in passing something he was interested in and I saw that he didn't get it for himself, then that could easily be slipped into the rotation. It was so much fun! Had he asked me to do this, though, it would've taken all of the pleasure out of it. Also worth point out that he did NOT give me a boat-load of gifts that same year.

Also you don't necessarily have to individually wrap them all you could just get those bulk bags where its like 5 or 6 small bags for 2 or 3 bucks and then stick them each in a bag. I think she would have been grateful for that because you put in the effort rather than just vetoing it out because its a lot of work.

I'd look very deeply first within yourself to ask whether you truly like her or not.\n\nNow to the calendar; her love language might be receiving gifts. That does not mean that you should give her an expensive advent calendar, but what about trying to craft something yourself? An advent calendar of memories of you guys, pictures, small that recall memories, etc. nothing costly. If you would do this and she is happy, it's a win.

Why didn't you sit together and talk it out? You have enough time for something, I am sure, so why not compromise? Why not going cheap but caring?

My dollar store has all of this, if you're lucky you can get some (fake) greenery or mini baubles to tie on to some of the gifts. May look more luxe than a premade kit!\n\n**Avoid perfume.** If you're hellbent on it there's MicroPerfumes, they do decanted samples of perfumes and constantly have sales. There are also sampler sets like the Maison Margiela Replica one (got it for around 30\u20ac and it's nice!) that could be split up between days. Be wary of fake perfumes via ebay!   \nMost skin care meant for the face like day/night creams, is very individual and expensive so I'd avoid that too. **Get nothing that needs to match her skin tone!** I'd also avoid facial peeling products.\n\n**Stuff worth getting for cheaper:** hand creams, sheet masks, foot masks, lip balms or glosses (the small rose-tinted Vaseline!), nail polishes, silky hair scrunchies (good for hair), tea or smoothies formulated with beauty goals in mind (sounds weird, I keep seeing regular tea brands make 'em though and I'd love to try them), reusable make up removal pads, beauty sponges. If she's a nail girlie try nail stickers.\n\nGo to grocery/regular drug stores for as much as you can with this, Sephora at least in my area is always more expensive.\n\nAdding **only 2-3 few big brand items** will get her the most bang for your buck. Get **travel sizes!** Stuff I've seen at sephora, for example: Better than sex mascara, laneige lip mask (very trendy and luxurious), fenty beauty lip glosses, shiseido lash curler.\n\n**Split up one purchase between days:** Lush is expensive but they have blocks of solid body wash (basically soap) that they can cut for you, I've unashamedly asked for a 2$ piece before. I'd say totally worth it to get 2-3 of those because Lush has intense scents she might like. You can also cut their bath bombs and use them for way more than one bath, if you look one that'd look as nice cut as it does in one piece (so a patterned bar rather than a santa face, for example), I'd recommend that.\n\nYou can do the same with sets of stuff, e.g. a set of scrunchies.", "No, and she wants nice things not a snack advent calendar.

That's so many birds to clean up after!", "Right?! I\u2019m the world\u2019s worst replacer of toilet paper, you know how I know I\u2019m loved? I go to get a piece and it\u2019s empty, panic, then look behind me and there\u2019s a full roll. In a bathroom my husband doesn\u2019t use. That\u2019s love right there.", "No not really. I pack my own stuff. We both have stressful jobs so texts are a distraction. Her love language is physical touch and mine is quality time.\n\nWe really don\u2019t give each-other gifts unless is a holiday or birthday. We still do date night and spend a lot of time together. Chores are split, we have no kids", "[deleted]", "Or, hear me out, wife could be mature and not try to base her life off of meaningless tictok relationship tests", "I think counseling is a good idea for this couple. The fact that she already recruited her friends to coerce her partner to comply is troubling. This type of behavior is to be expected of a child, not an adult life partner. I don't like the term punishment for an adult because we are adults. Consequences are in fact a type of punishment, but leaning towards the direct affect caused by an action that has previously been discouraged. OP told her no and she continues to press the issue. The wife needs to be corrected in a way that makes sense to her seemingly immature mind based on the info given.", "So, as my daughter said when I reported my BF had just come in and kissed me. WHILE I WAS IN THE BATHROOM POOPING. She said it's love. I said it was insanity. Sometimes it's the same concept depending on your point of view.", "[deleted]", "I think her love language is gifts.", "And as the post and OPs comments outline the GF has stated that's not acceptable to her. She isn't interested in notes or cheap stuff/snacks. She wants a designer advent calander.\n\nYou also have not addressed the fact the GF has explicitly stated she will not be returning that effort, this is just for her. Why should OP put in this level of effort when his partner is unwilling to do the same?", "Tbh finding 24 gifts is a whole lot of time, people struggle with five gifts for someone, 24 things you know your SO will like is a ton of work.\n\nNot to mention she asked around thanksgiving so she gave him so little time.\n\nGift shopping takes time\n\nAlso her not making him one either just add insult to injury", "It\u2019s not, we had this conversation.", "[deleted]"]}
