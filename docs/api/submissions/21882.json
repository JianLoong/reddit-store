If you invite you pay unless you invite telling them telling them you want to split.

You should not expect others to pay for you.", "NTA. Asking someone out then expecting them to pay is weird.

Just because something is traditional doesn't mean it should be carried out. After all, that tradition comes from a very different time period.\n\nIf you cannot pay for something, make it known before the date. Then the guy can either let you know he's willing to cover or you can both do a different activity. You should be aware of enough of changing times to know it's on you to figure out things before the date, not on him.", "If a guy invites me out I expect him to pay, if I incite him out I will pay, nothing wrong with chivalry, men nowadays are trash", "Where you born 60 years ago?

Would you be cool with him expecting you to pay and being surprised when you ask for half?\n\nIdk why people here are saying \u201cyou invite out you pay\u201d. That\u2019s never now it works.

So this is either ESH or NAH but either way you need to decide how much you care. If you really cate, you are incompatible.

Date someone different.", "I would say first date it depends on who invited who, but after that, usually, pay your share. In this case if you do want to go out to diner, maybe ask for separate bills.

A date isn\u2019t a host/hosted situation but a meet up on \u201cneutral\u201d ground as part of getting to know each other. If you are asked to a date, and money is an issue, you would be honest and let them know that cost is an issue. By agreeing to meet at X spot, whether a movie theater or a restaurant, for instance, you would obviously pay your own way. Were I to date someone who did not want to pay their way, then that would be the last date.", "I'm going with NTA because he is inviting you on these dates. Usually, the person who invites is the one who pays UNLESS there was an agreement at the time of invite that you are paying or paying half. \nA lot of dates will split the bill nowadays, but again, usually the person who sets up the date pays.", "NAH. I live in a liberal city and still never paid for dates when I was single.  I don't think I've ever had a guy ask to split but if he did I would have split it and then just never gone out with him again.\n\nIn an an exclusive relationship I financially contribute but when single I'm certainly not spending money to go out with random guys who asked me out, LOL.\n\nHowever, you should just stop going out with him.  I don't think it's fair to \"expect\" him to do this for you.  He's clearly shown he doesn't want to so I think you should both move on and find better matches.  To be honest with you I think you should target guys in their late 20s/early 30s.", "I think if he\u2019s really into you he would pay but I\u2019m old fashioned.", "Slight ESH: I agree that within reason, the person asking pays, unless there's a prior arrangement.  Maybe he thinks he's being pro-feminist by making sure you have the chance to chip in.  Or he feels asking is fair since you have him chip in when he's over your budget.\n\nBut he doesn't sticking you with the bill; he asks IF you want to pay.  Just say, \"No, I only want to pay when I ask you out.\"  Or have a talk with him, instead of weirding out without even trying to have a conversation.  Trust me, if your relationship continues, there will be much more challenging conversations ahead.", "NAH. Just have a conversation with the guy so you can be on the same page moving forward.

He asks, he should expect to pay the bill unless agreed on in advance. \n\nI\u2019m not even traditional and I have always preferred to pay my own way on dates\u2014especially early on so the guy doesn\u2019t feel like I owe him something.

Now that my boyfriend and I live together we make it fair.", "I\u2019m a 60 year old woman and if I try dating anyone my husband of 37 years probably won\u2019t approve\u2026but it seems to me that past the first few dates, where the one that asks, pays, it seems fair to me not to split the bill, but to take turns suggesting a restaurant and paying the entire bill when it\u2019s your turn to pick the restaurant. \n\nThat way when available money isn\u2019t the same, the person with more can pick more expensive places, and the person with less can have fun searching out inexpensive little holes in the wall with great food.", "NTA this is a pet peeve of mine. Who asks someone out on a date and expects them to pay for it without saying something ahead of time? Also it sounds like you want to be treated a little bit more, being a lady and all, and I respect that because that\u2019s what you want in a man so don\u2019t settle because they are out there.", "NAH You two need to talk and set expectations on whose paying or if you're splitting the bill before the date commences.", "NTA. Guys don\u2019t have to always pay, but if he is the one that is asking you out, selecting the restaurant, etc. he should at least offer to pay.", "Not when someone else is inviting you on a date.

I agree with her that this should have been discussed prior to going out for the reasons that I said.\n\nIf she asks him out to dinner and doesn't pay for the whole thing, she's TA. But she didn't ask about that.\n\nI think her idea of \"the man should pay\" is outdated.", "Honey, don't settle for an unequal relationship. Not only does resentment from chores add up *a lot*, but if they won't even split chores with you there are probably a lot of other red flags they're hiding. \n\nHold the men around you to a higher standard. If you just assume they'll fail, you've already given them permission to do so. I say this as someone who is from the south and who knows few men who pull their weight chore-wise. Their wives and gfs enable this behavior, so of course nothing ever changes.", "Sharing/compromise ... it doesn't get any better than this.  Nice to  hear someone has a relationship that is happy and makes decisions to improve happiness.", "Keep in mind that your audience here is probably an extremely different population than the majority of men who you date, especially if you are attractive. None of the women in my circle ever paid to go out with men when we were single and it would have been a huge turn off if a guy didn't automatically pay for a dinner he asked us to.  It's different if you're in a serious relationship, of course, and more dependent on your individual circumstances.  \n\n If you're dating a super feminist guy who completely rejects gender roles I suppose it's fine to split the bill but I would take the replies here with a grain of salt (including mine).", "Because he invited her on the date ??", "For real. One of my proudest moments was telling him he could quit that job he hates. I hold open the door and he will pack me a lunch. Its all about balance and respect", "Considering he's extremely hard to get to express any kind of emotion or expectation going forward on a relationship and seems to try to 'coach' me to do chores and behaviors he likes, I would be really surprised if so.
