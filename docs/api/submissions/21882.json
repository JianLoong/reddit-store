Or, since I'm not a drinker, maybe you'd alternate rounds.\n\n\"We should meet up for lunch!\" typically means that you're going to eat together but each pay for your own thing.\n\n\"Hey! Can I take you to lunch?\" is an invitation and the person inviting should pay.", "This is clearly not the first date though, given that they\u2019ve been seeing each other for a month. If he\u2019s inviting her out for all of the dates they\u2019ve had so far I would find it odd to use that as a reason to never contribute. His offer to split seems perfectly reasonable.", "There may a simple disconnect in the way y'all are imagining these invitations.  \n\n\nIf I were to ask a woman, \"can I take you out to dinner at Frank Pepe's on Friday?\" I would presume that I would be paying; if at the end of the meal she offered to split the cost, I might or might not decline.  \n\n\nHowever, if I were to ask a woman, \"hey, you wanna get together for drinks or dinner on Friday, or sometime this weekend?\" I wouldn't presume I was paying, and likely be a little disappointed in her when she didn't move as I reached for my wallet. Perhaps the difference is she would have been choosing the time and location of the date? At any rate, there's a difference there for me.  \n\n\nFor what it's worth, I'm more likely to ask the second way. But not because I'm cheap!", "It read like that to me, because of the cultural norm thing. It\u2019s seen as the \u2018norm\u2019 in a lot of places. I don\u2019t agree with it and I feel some people get really entitled with this, making them an AH in my eyes. And just because someone invites *me* somewhere, I don\u2019t expect them to pay.", "Exactly\u2026 Pfffft. Once would be enough for me. He\u2019s invited her out on a date, then creates an awkward situation by expecting to split the bill when the meeting was at *his* request\u2026 \n\nPersonally, I would value my time too much to entertain anything further.\n\nETA: NTA", "Lmfao of course I read the whole thing. I honestly dgaf how you interpret it, I stand by what I said", "I don\u2019t think you\u2019re wrong. I would almost go as far to say that most of the world still adheres to this gender role in particular. Going halfsies and women paying for dates is a newer (recent generations) concept  that SOME people in Westernized countries adhere to. I\u2019ve paid for a few dates with some long term partners to be kind, but I\u2019ve never been on a date where that was an expectation.", "I skimmed through so I thought the specific date op talked about she was asked out and then had to pay the entire bill.", "I mean I take \u201cor soemthing\u201d as he pays for the whole thing. But leaving the decision up to her. They were both brought up to man pays for everything and she says she tries to keep things equal. So maybe him asking is him trying to keep things equal?", "Subtract taxes. Lot less than that.", "In literally any other scenario telling the person you\u2019re with that they should pay for your meal because they make more than you or have fewer bills would make you look ridiculously entitled. I think this only becomes relevant farther into a long term relationship", "And OP only mentioned her bills and left it vague as to what \u201clower\u201d means. And it\u2019s a fucking month in. How much of the others finances do they actually know about each other?", "I can\u2019t tell if he just is more comfortable financially and doesn\u2019t see the cost the same way, if he\u2019s trying to be equal, or if he\u2019s just being cheap. You know him better than us. If you liked everything else about him, I\u2019d just say o can\u2019t afford to go out on dates like this. If he likes you, he\u2019d either offer to pay more or suggest cheaper dates. If you don\u2019t really like him that much, yeah, I\u2019d say going forward be willing to take turns or split. Keep communicating regardless even when it\u2019s awkward.", "Those comments were not posted when I posted (or I missed them), so I focused on the main post that says \u201che\u2019s been inviting me on dates\u201d.  But yes, if she asked him, she should be prepared to pay.", "Just because it is considered \u201cculturally normal \u201c, doesn\u2019t mean it is normal or right at all. That is a trend started by entitled people. Not sure who raised you with that type of mentality, but they failed you.", "Nope, not assuming that. Saying there's a strong correlation, which is absolutely true. 21st century women don't rely on men to buy them things. and when they do it frequently sets up a toxic power dynamic.", "Either I'd pay for me because what I wanted would have been more than half, or I paid a larger chunk of the bill when it would have been fair to split. I believe he paid on one date, but I didn't ask him to and was fully ready to pay my share, I thanked him when he paid. I'd say dates had been pretty even up until this point.After finding out about each other's finances, it kind of struck me funny that he asked me out and then asked me if I wanted to pay. I think from everyone's responses, I've realized that I was taught something outdated and it wasn't really fair for me to assume he'd pay, that's just what I was used to.", "OP said she was raised in a \"traditional\" Southern manner.\n\nBased on that, I'm assuming she expects the guy to do the \"asking out\" every time.\n\nReal convenient to say \"the person doing the asking out\" should pay when OP is pretty much setting things up so she can get a free meal from the guy on a date every single time.\n\nI'm a man. During the first like 6 months or so of dating a woman, I would be okay with paying for her meal sometimes. Not every time, but maybe like once every 4 or 5 dates.\n\nIf I realize early on that she expects me to be her meal ticket and pay for her every single time, I'll just end things. I'm not a cash machine she can use for free food at restaurants.", "I don't date so idk, but if I was in the early stages of dating, e.g. less than 3 months, I'm expecting a split, no matter who said what or why. If you can't pay for your end of the date, you look dependent imo, and I don't need more dependents. Again, though, I don't date so to each their own.", "What...on dates?\n\nI suppose the devil's in the details: if it was \"Hey babe, let me take you out somewhere!\" Then yeah, one'd expect them to pay \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "So when you're invited to a birthday party, you pay for it?", "You agreed to the date. \n\nYou aren't doing them a favour for fucks sake.\n\nThis sexism needs to go away.", "I've also paid and split with long term partners, but when starting out, the guy has paid in my experience.", "I\u2019m guessing he doesn\u2019t see it as a big deal if he\u2019s not as financially strained, but the ask for her to pay the whole bill (if he\u2019s doing that) at a somewhat expensive restaurant is shocking and I guess off-putting, even if it\u2019s just a question. OP is definitely due for a conversation regardless of what was meant here. She needs to say she can\u2019t afford these dates.", "$500? Still. I\u2019m going to make that much more in a few months. That\u2019s huge.", "Still a huge sum of money to many people", "[deleted]", "[deleted]", "This doesn't just apply to dates. Invitations are extended to friends or co-workers as well.\n\nBottom line is if you invite a person somewhere, you should be prepared to pay their way because they're only there because ***you asked them to be there.***", "You\u2019d expect them to pay, not me. When I first started dating my husband, I\u2019d insist on paying for my own or at least a part of our date, so it was equal and I wasn\u2019t taking advantage. It\u2019s just what I wanted to do. Despite who asks who, I\u2019m happy paying my share, I don\u2019t like taking anyone\u2019s money or letting people pay for me. I never have.", "Clearly in this context I meant dates babes", "She should definitely talk to him. honesty a lot of these AITA don\u2019t even try to talk to the people before asking Reddit", "Relationships change kid. Not everything is exactly like it is at the very beginning. They can be fluid and ask for changes to status quo. Especially one that is just a month old.", "It\u2019s entitled because you are **telling** them, not asking them.  Having more bills or less money relative to your friend/date/whatever does not make you inherently deserving of a free meal on their dime. You can ask, and they will hopefully understand, but it\u2019s not something you should expect or demand. Adults are supposed to responsible for all of their own purchases and finances.", "They're a month in. Way too soon for her to be spending his money. Splitting the check for the first few months of dating makes sense since you're still figuring out if there are going to be future dates. Five years in it would be wild to send your partner a Venmo request for half the dinner bill because by that point you've likely both paid your fair share of bills.", "1 cent a month is less. Is it enough to cover all the dates that they go on? \n\nAnd again, how much of his finances does she actually know? OP left a lot of detail out that leaves it ambiguous.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with asking to split the bill. His method, while not the best, is a reasonable request even if she has more bills and makes less.", "Every single time I've been invited out somewhere, by friends or coworkers or dates I've been fully prepared to pay myself and intend to, and only don't if they offer (or I pay for them).\n\nIf I don't have the cash for whatever it is I tell the people who invite me upfront and they either say it's cool to not come, or they would pay for me.", "Take this how you want, cuz maybe how you do things has been working just fine for you, but I feel like you're mincing words in a way that doesn't mesh with real life. In all the times I've been invited places, I was only there because they asked me to be there, but it was also totally implied that I'd be paying for myself when they ask. Maybe I've just never had any relationships on that level. I have very few friends anymore solely because friendship is often more expensive than I care to pay for.", "That's fair enough...I don't think OP made the case that she expects to get a free ride and be paid for for everything though. She sounds willing to contribute.", "Why would she go into that amount of detail? Struggling with medical bills is enough to show she can\u2019t cover it herself. And if he can\u2019t cover it either then why is he inviting her out on so many dates?", "MmMmmmMMMMMmmmm I dunno lol I don\u2019t really care if I\u2019m honest \ud83d\ude02", "Why would she leave out details in this sub? For validation of her own opinion. I\u2019m not asking for a detailed tax document, just more than vague less than and information about how the relationship functions on a detail she brought up.\n\n\u201cSo many dates\u201d is also not defined here. And he\u2019s trying to have a relationship. If neither asks for dates, the relationship dies. Is she asking? Idk. Sounds like she puts it on him to ask and expects him to pay because he asked.", "Oh great, I thought you might've read past the first few lines \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "Oh I did I just don\u2019t care for a debate lol I don\u2019t think we will agree anyways", "\ud83d\udc4d"]}
