I offered them to Emily to see if she wanted them instead, but she said no because she only really likes to fiddle with her own stuff.\n\nI told her that\u2019s okay but her slime isn\u2019t allowed to leave the room she\u2019ll be sleeping in, because that room isn\u2019t carpeted.\n\nOn the second day of their visit, she went up to me, crying, saying she\u2019d got some of the slime on the floor. I expected it to be on the floor of her own bedroom, where I could get it off relatively easily, but she led me to MY bedroom, and it was stuck in the carpet. \n\nI told her to leave the room, and that I would deal with it, not shouting or raising my voice but probably with clenched teeth as I was pretty angry at not only a violation of the rules I had set up but also of my privacy (she\u2019s visited before and knows that my room is out of bounds to her).\n\nI managed to clean it, but I told John that while we could still do all the activities we\u2019d planned, he and Emily had to stay in a hotel for the rest of their trip, as I couldn\u2019t trust that this wouldn\u2019t happen again.

Neither you nor your niece are to blame.  Your brother, however, is TA. \n\nFor the commentors who say she's 12 and old enough...  neurodiversity actually hinders the development of the brain, so while she may physically be 12, she may actually be more around the 9/10 age emotionally.  \n\nAdhd has a mixture of symptoms. Such as impulsively, distraction, and hyperfocus. If the door was open and she saw something that caught her attention, then she wouldn't have seen the other challenges around her, like the carpet.  She may not have even registered she was in your room\nIs it also possible that the carpet provided a sensory calming effect  for her? I know you've told her about privacy before,  but has she actually remembered? I can tell my children something, and within a few seconds, it's like I've never mentioned it.. and they aren't doing it on purpose. It's the memory/attention span. She may well have also completely forgotten the not in my bedroom rule. ( My son is 12 and diagnosed. This really does happen frequently, and he genuinely gets distressed about it..  your niece getting distressed tells me this was not on purpose)\n\nYou, yourself having autism means you have your own rules, and regualtors, one of those being the rules for slime. I totally get it. It's not unreasonable, and you should not have triggers that are sprung on you unexpectedly. Your home is your safe space and regualatory environment.  My children get very overwhelmed when anything is changed in their room or something spilt. Son gets very anxious over it. Your frustration and anger are valid but should be directed towards your brother. \n\nYour brother should have checked that his daughter had everything she needed to accommodate her needs. He didn't. He didn't offer to go and purchase more fidget toys or offer to clean.  He did consider your needs, either. He is aware of both diagnoses. He still did nothing. This is fully on him.  Please make sure your niece understands or explains that you both have different tactics to help you regulate.  This is not her fault.\n\n\"Brother, your lack of planning, or accommodating either of us, made it very difficult for me to regulate. You are fully aware of your daughters needs. As her dad, you should have been fully prepared to adapt and provide alternatives when she forgot her bag. I tried and made my expectations very clear. This is for my requirements and needs. You are fully aware of this.. I do not blame niece at all. She has had a lovely weekend and  I'm sure we will have a fun time together again. In the future, if you wish to stay,  you need to respect my wishes. This is my home and safe space.

He also should know by now that you would struggle with the slime (I won't let my kids take slime anywhere else, it stays at ours - but they have some great squishy oobleck filled balls that provide a very similar sensation without the mess). \n\nFrom what you have said it sounds like you handled the situation very well, you still had fun with your niece for her birthday, no residual divide between you and her despite the discomfort her mistake had caused you and the upset she had felt when she realised her mistake.

And it was like, 8 years ago and they STILL suck.", "My coping mechanism consists of checklists and sticky notes \\*everywhere\\*.", "Sure I\u2019ve had to tell them to stop doing things - things I hadn\u2019t previously told them not to do, and things like bickering and accidentally talking too loudly, etc..  If I told them \u201cdon\u2019t go in the pool area\u201d at my relative\u2019s house then NO, they didn\u2019t go in the pool area.  No threat or punishment required.  Not sure why that\u2019s hard to believe.  Do your kids regularly run into the street after you\u2019ve told them not to?  Do you just expect your kid to do the opposite of what you tell them to do every single time?  That sounds exhausting.\n\nWe started going to art museums at age 4.  I NEVER had to tell them not to run.  They knew that wasn\u2019t the place for running.  It\u2019s really not hard to model good behavior and have your kids follow it.  Based on my family and friends, it\u2019s actually the NORM, not the exception as you seem to think.\n\nOh, and one of my kids has ADHD.  Shockingly he still doesn\u2019t directly disregard anyone\u2018s simple instructions.  I mean aside from his sibling\u2019s, but that\u2019s a different matter altogether.  Yes, I\u2019ve been repeatedly told that he\u2019s a model student.  He may talk too loud, need to stand by his desk instead of sit, or go to another room to concentrate, but he doesn\u2019t use his \u201cdiagnosis\u201d as an excuse to misbehave and he NEVER has.", "My family enjoyed celebrating holidays at our aunt's and uncles' homes.  My brothers and I were never perfect children. nor were our many cousins.  What we DID NOT DO was break rules at relative's houses because we knew the consequences of breaking rules in other people's homes would have been  more severe  than breaking similar rules at homes. ie, my father worked for a bakery and my siblings and I would sometimes sneak a treat between meals, which my mother strictly forbid.  We never got into any forbidden food at my relatives' homes and vice versa. At my own home, with my siblings and neighborhood friends, we sometimes went into the woods where we were not supposed to play, but at relatives' homes everyone stayed on the property of the host, we did not roam the neighborhood. Our parents interacted with us, the parents played softball with us, or observed us swimming, or cheered us on in volleyball.  The parents might have been the partial throwers during a dodgeball session. Our parents interacted with us and we all had fun..  One uncle was wealthy and had a second home on a lake and had barbecues . There were ALWAYS parents watching the children swimming    I was responsible enough at 12 that I was hired to babysit 5 child, the youngest of whom was 6 months old, for 5 or 6 hours a day, 5 days a week , during summer vacation.  I made their lunch, cleaned up afterwards, and sometimes started dinner.  I got extra money if I ironed  clothes. I did NOT go into the parents' bedroom.  Nothing was ever damaged because I did not follow instructions.  Expectations were different in the 60s and early 70s.  kt", "Yep.  Ze man has bipolar, ze boy has ADHD, and although I've never been formally diagnosed, my niece was diagnosed with ADHD recently and she's \\*exactly\\* like I was at her age (reading non-class-related books in class, daydreaming, being late for everything because she gets distracted).\n\nMakes turning in official school forms a barrel of laughs, because half the time we don't know where they are, who had them last, or remember when they were due by.", "Touretts is, Downs is not.

They were told no slime period, refused any alternatives (OPs or new ones), told ok but only in your room, then proceeded to not only spill the slime outside their room but in a room they are NEVER allowed in on any visit. There is nothing OP didn\u2019t do they could have. Keep saying it & be ignored? Take the slime away altogether? Neither of them scrubbed that floor for an hour.

All of you acting like your parents NEVER had to tell you to stop doing something anywhere in public are full of shit. You weren't perfect. Your kids aren't perfect. Stop. Lying. Be honest.

It\u2019s not that tough to understand.  I never had to punish my kids to get them to not run in a museum.  I told them not to do it and they could instantly see that the museum wasn\u2019t a place for running.  They were FOUR.  You don\u2019t have to punish, punish, punish to keep kids from doing the wrong thing, you just have to reinforce and normalize correct behavior.", "Some people mistake fear for good behaviour."]}
