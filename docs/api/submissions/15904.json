The plan was that they would stay with me at my house for a few days so that they could celebrate Emily\u2019s birthday with me.\n\nJohn told me beforehand that, due to Emily\u2019s ADHD, she would bring some fidget toys with her, and I said that that\u2019s fine, as long as she wouldn\u2019t leave them lying around or make a mess (I like to keep a tidy and clean house - my home growing up was always filthy and I couldn\u2019t stand it).\n\nWhen they arrived, I saw that one of the \u2018fidget toys\u2019 John had told me about was that horrid slime stuff, and she was playing/fiddling with it when she walked in.\n\nI absolutely detest it, it just makes a sticky mess, so I asked her if she had brought anything else to fiddle with, and she said she forgot her bag of fidget stuff so she only had this.\n\nI didn\u2019t want her to be in distress, and I myself have autism so I also have things for stimming with. I offered them to Emily to see if she wanted them instead, but she said no because she only really likes to fiddle with her own stuff.\n\nI told her that\u2019s okay but her slime isn\u2019t allowed to leave the room she\u2019ll be sleeping in, because that room isn\u2019t carpeted.\n\nOn the second day of their visit, she went up to me, crying, saying she\u2019d got some of the slime on the floor. I expected it to be on the floor of her own bedroom, where I could get it off relatively easily, but she led me to MY bedroom, and it was stuck in the carpet.\n\nI told her to leave the room, and that I would deal with it, not shouting or raising my voice but probably with clenched teeth as I was pretty angry at not only a violation of the rules I had set up but also of my privacy (she\u2019s visited before and knows that my room is out of bounds to her).\n\nI managed to clean it, but the dye in it left a stain. I told John that while we could still do all the activities we\u2019d planned, he and Emily had to stay in a hotel for the rest of their trip, as I couldn\u2019t trust that this wouldn\u2019t happen again. I offered to pay half of the costs, but John declined.\n\nIt still was a good trip, and Emily had fun on her birthday, but John is nevertheless angry with me for forcing him to pay for a hotel just because Emily made a mistake.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: I\u2019ve noticed that in the comments a lot of people have been misgendering me (accidentally, I assume) and I would just like to clarify that my pronouns are she/her, as stated above.\n\nSecond edit: I like how this is an actual discussion, there are people agreeing and disagreeing with each other. Most AITA posts are just echo chambers\n\nEdit trois: I forgot to mention, I suppose because it was just so obvious to me, but I did have to use vinegar to get the slime out of the carpet, and of course vinegar has a very strong smell. As someone with autism, smells are a pretty big deal for me, and it was quite distressing to clean.", "created_utc": 1682696967, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/131yhuj/aita_for_kicking_my_brother_and_his_daughter_out/", "score": 4846, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Neither you nor your niece are to blame.  Your brother, however, is TA. \n\nFor the commentors who say she's 12 and old enough...  neurodiversity actually hinders the development of the brain, so while she may physically be 12, she may actually be more around the 9/10 age emotionally.  \n\nAdhd has a mixture of symptoms. Such as impulsively, distraction, and hyperfocus. If the door was open and she saw something that caught her attention, then she wouldn't have seen the other challenges around her, like the carpet.  She may not have even registered she was in your room\nIs it also possible that the carpet provided a sensory calming effect  for her? I know you've told her about privacy before,  but has she actually remembered? I can tell my children something, and within a few seconds, it's like I've never mentioned it.. and they aren't doing it on purpose. It's the memory/attention span. She may well have also completely forgotten the not in my bedroom rule. ( My son is 12 and diagnosed. This really does happen frequently, and he genuinely gets distressed about it..  your niece getting distressed tells me this was not on purpose)\n\nYou, yourself having autism means you have your own rules, and regualtors, one of those being the rules for slime. I totally get it. It's not unreasonable, and you should not have triggers that are sprung on you unexpectedly. Your home is your safe space and regualatory environment.  My children get very overwhelmed when anything is changed in their room or something spilt. Son gets very anxious over it. Your frustration and anger are valid but should be directed towards your brother. \n\nYour brother should have checked that his daughter had everything she needed to accommodate her needs. He didn't. He didn't offer to go and purchase more fidget toys or offer to clean.  He did consider your needs, either. He is aware of both diagnoses. He still did nothing. This is fully on him.  Please make sure your niece understands or explains that you both have different tactics to help you regulate.  This is not her fault.\n\n\"Brother, your lack of planning, or accommodating either of us, made it very difficult for me to regulate. You are fully aware of your daughters needs. As her dad, you should have been fully prepared to adapt and provide alternatives when she forgot her bag. I tried and made my expectations very clear. This is for my requirements and needs. You are fully aware of this.. I do not blame niece at all. She has had a lovely weekend and  I'm sure we will have a fun time together again. In the future, if you wish to stay,  you need to respect my wishes. This is my home and safe space.
