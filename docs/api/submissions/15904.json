Neither you nor your niece are to blame.  Your brother, however, is TA. \n\nFor the commentors who say she's 12 and old enough...  neurodiversity actually hinders the development of the brain, so while she may physically be 12, she may actually be more around the 9/10 age emotionally.  \n\nAdhd has a mixture of symptoms. Such as impulsively, distraction, and hyperfocus. If the door was open and she saw something that caught her attention, then she wouldn't have seen the other challenges around her, like the carpet.  She may not have even registered she was in your room\nIs it also possible that the carpet provided a sensory calming effect  for her? I know you've told her about privacy before,  but has she actually remembered? I can tell my children something, and within a few seconds, it's like I've never mentioned it.. and they aren't doing it on purpose. It's the memory/attention span. She may well have also completely forgotten the not in my bedroom rule. ( My son is 12 and diagnosed. This really does happen frequently, and he genuinely gets distressed about it..  your niece getting distressed tells me this was not on purpose)\n\nYou, yourself having autism means you have your own rules, and regualtors, one of those being the rules for slime. I totally get it. It's not unreasonable, and you should not have triggers that are sprung on you unexpectedly. Your home is your safe space and regualatory environment.  My children get very overwhelmed when anything is changed in their room or something spilt. Son gets very anxious over it. Your frustration and anger are valid but should be directed towards your brother. \n\nYour brother should have checked that his daughter had everything she needed to accommodate her needs. He didn't. He didn't offer to go and purchase more fidget toys or offer to clean.  He did consider your needs, either. He is aware of both diagnoses. He still did nothing. This is fully on him.  Please make sure your niece understands or explains that you both have different tactics to help you regulate.  This is not her fault.\n\n\"Brother, your lack of planning, or accommodating either of us, made it very difficult for me to regulate. You are fully aware of your daughters needs. As her dad, you should have been fully prepared to adapt and provide alternatives when she forgot her bag. I tried and made my expectations very clear. This is for my requirements and needs. You are fully aware of this.. I do not blame niece at all. She has had a lovely weekend and  I'm sure we will have a fun time together again. In the future, if you wish to stay,  you need to respect my wishes. This is my home and safe space.

He also should know by now that you would struggle with the slime (I won't let my kids take slime anywhere else, it stays at ours - but they have some great squishy oobleck filled balls that provide a very similar sensation without the mess). \n\nFrom what you have said it sounds like you handled the situation very well, you still had fun with your niece for her birthday, no residual divide between you and her despite the discomfort her mistake had caused you and the upset she had felt when she realised her mistake.
