The plan was that they would stay with me at my house for a few days so that they could celebrate Emily\u2019s birthday with me.\n\nJohn told me beforehand that, due to Emily\u2019s ADHD, she would bring some fidget toys with her, and I said that that\u2019s fine, as long as she wouldn\u2019t leave them lying around or make a mess (I like to keep a tidy and clean house - my home growing up was always filthy and I couldn\u2019t stand it).\n\nWhen they arrived, I saw that one of the \u2018fidget toys\u2019 John had told me about was that horrid slime stuff, and she was playing/fiddling with it when she walked in.\n\nI absolutely detest it, it just makes a sticky mess, so I asked her if she had brought anything else to fiddle with, and she said she forgot her bag of fidget stuff so she only had this.\n\nI didn\u2019t want her to be in distress, and I myself have autism so I also have things for stimming with. I offered them to Emily to see if she wanted them instead, but she said no because she only really likes to fiddle with her own stuff.\n\nI told her that\u2019s okay but her slime isn\u2019t allowed to leave the room she\u2019ll be sleeping in, because that room isn\u2019t carpeted.\n\nOn the second day of their visit, she went up to me, crying, saying she\u2019d got some of the slime on the floor. I expected it to be on the floor of her own bedroom, where I could get it off relatively easily, but she led me to MY bedroom, and it was stuck in the carpet.\n\nI told her to leave the room, and that I would deal with it, not shouting or raising my voice but probably with clenched teeth as I was pretty angry at not only a violation of the rules I had set up but also of my privacy (she\u2019s visited before and knows that my room is out of bounds to her).\n\nI managed to clean it, but I told John that while we could still do all the activities we\u2019d planned, he and Emily had to stay in a hotel for the rest of their trip, as I couldn\u2019t trust that this wouldn\u2019t happen again. I offered to pay half of the costs, but John declined.\n\nIt still was a good trip, and Emily had fun on her birthday, but John is nevertheless angry with me for forcing him to pay for a hotel just because Emily made a mistake.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: I\u2019ve noticed that in the comments a lot of people have been misgendering me (accidentally, I assume) and I would just like to clarify that my pronouns are she/her, as stated above.\n\nSecond edit: I would also like to say that I was not angry with my niece, I was upset about what she did. Which is to say, the rules I have set are rules I rely on. As someone with autism, they are very important to me, and so I was upset that those rules hadn\u2019t been followed, and for the rest of the day I felt very distressed.\n\nAnd a third edit for good measure: I like how this is an actual discussion, there are people agreeing and disagreeing with each other.

Neither you nor your niece are to blame.  Your brother, however, is TA. \n\nFor the commentors who say she's 12 and old enough...  neurodiversity actually hinders the development of the brain, so while she may physically be 12, she may actually be more around the 9/10 age emotionally.  \n\nAdhd has a mixture of symptoms. Such as impulsively, distraction, and hyperfocus. If the door was open and she saw something that caught her attention, then she wouldn't have seen the other challenges around her, like the carpet.  She may not have even registered she was in your room\nIs it also possible that the carpet provided a sensory calming effect  for her? I know you've told her about privacy before,  but has she actually remembered? I can tell my children something, and within a few seconds, it's like I've never mentioned it.. and they aren't doing it on purpose. It's the memory/attention span. She may well have also completely forgotten the not in my bedroom rule. ( My son is 12 and diagnosed. This really does happen frequently, and he genuinely gets distressed about it..  your niece getting distressed tells me this was not on purpose)\n\nYou, yourself having autism means you have your own rules, and regualtors, one of those being the rules for slime. I totally get it. It's not unreasonable, and you should not have triggers that are sprung on you unexpectedly. Your home is your safe space and regualatory environment.  My children get very overwhelmed when anything is changed in their room or something spilt. Son gets very anxious over it. Your frustration and anger are valid but should be directed towards your brother. \n\nYour brother should have checked that his daughter had everything she needed to accommodate her needs. He didn't. He didn't offer to go and purchase more fidget toys or offer to clean.  He did consider your needs, either. He is aware of both diagnoses. He still did nothing. This is fully on him.  Please make sure your niece understands or explains that you both have different tactics to help you regulate.  This is not her fault.\n\n\"Brother, your lack of planning, or accommodating either of us, made it very difficult for me to regulate. You are fully aware of your daughters needs. As her dad, you should have been fully prepared to adapt and provide alternatives when she forgot her bag. I tried and made my expectations very clear. This is for my requirements and needs. You are fully aware of this.. I do not blame niece at all. She has had a lovely weekend and  I'm sure we will have a fun time together again. In the future, if you wish to stay,  you need to respect my wishes. This is my home and safe space.

But then again my husband has ADHD and I have to remind him of everything.", "Arguably more, ADHDers and autistic folk are more likely to date their own neurotype, and then each other, and then other neurotypes apart from NT, and then NTs as far as I have read.", "And he\u2019s an adult so he should be way more adapted than his 12 year old", "Did you require being reminded as child of rules at other people's houses that you weren't at often? It doesn't say that op reminded her 12yr old niece with ADHD of her bedroom rule just the slime rule. Personally I wouldn't have allowed it in my house at all but whatever. Yes everyone has every right to make whatever rule they want but why is it 1 chance only? She's 12, probably going or starting puberty on top of being ADHD she is going to forget things that aren't constant in her day to day life. For wanting your rules followed you're not really an AH but for expecting perfection without a second chance you most definitely are TAH.", "Took a good hour to get it out :)\n\nNot a very nice sensory experience either.", "You said it, not me.", "It sounds like it was a really hard situation. I've been weighing in, but I don't really know you, your family, or what happened. Even if I think I would have done something differently, I wasn't there to deal with what you were dealing with.", "It\u2019s your responsibility to manage your feelings of distress appropriately.

It's up to them to decide. I am just making a snap judgment about something on the internet, like anyone else.", ">Getting served consequences for your actions doesn't make the serving person an asshole.\n\nNo, not always.\n\nSometimes, though, it definitely does.", "Agreed, but for me this too far. The child could have easily wandered in unthinking, not in a break-the-rules defiant way, but in a neurodivergent way.", "You may not have the same kind of neurodivergence, otherwise you would understand how this was most likely not a malicious action. She was upset and told the OP about the accident. She didn\u2019t try to hide it. That leads me to think her mind wandered beyond her control or perhaps she had poor impulse moment. what she did when she came back was honourable.", "Look this is really basic problem solving, if the ones she had didn't work the dad could have found more. There is nothing stated by OP that even remotely indicates that this couldn't have happened.", "OP said she worried the niece would do it again. How many times would niece have to break the rules, how many times would OP have to clean the carpet, before it would be non-AHish to send them away? Why do OP's neurodiverse needs not matter?", "Lol, as a person who has hosted gatherings at her house and who\u2019s parents have hosted hundreds of gatherings in their house I can honestly say when we said \u201cdon\u2019t go upstairs\u201d or \u201cdon\u2019t go in the basement\u201d they listened because they knew there would be consequences.  Maybe it\u2019s our Hispanic upbringing but when you do something wrong you get punished (and I don\u2019t mean anything physical). Now drinks have spilled and accidents happen, yeah that\u2019s normal but none of the kids purposely disobeyed the rules. \n\nAgain, could be a cultural thing because even growing up, my cousins and I would not break rules in other peoples houses. It was drilled into our heads as kids that you can mess up in your home but never in someone else\u2019s house. My sister in law will watch her kids like a hawk to make sure they behave. People may not want to believe it but it\u2019s possible for kids to be kids without destroying things.", "OP offered alternative items for stimming with, budged on her hatred of slime, gave clear rules about where the slime could be, and had a standing rule about not going into her room. It\u2019s the repeated stepping on OP\u2019s limits that I don\u2019t like. Would I kick them out? No, but the kid either should\u2019ve known better than to go into OP\u2019s room, or should\u2019ve been watched better. No one likes people going into their bedrooms without permission, and OP would\u2019ve never known about it if Emily hadn\u2019t dropped the slime. What other impulsive things could she have gotten up to in there?", "Lol. I have kids. Nice try, though. I just teach then to be respectful when they're guests in someone else's house, which is apparently a foreign concept to you.", "My son (15M) has adhd and goes away with my parents to their beach house often. He usually forgets all underwear, or one time when it was 35 degrees he only packed a swim suit (there is an indoor pool) 6 tank tops, and one pair of shorts for a 3 day trip. We\u2019ve let him take responsibility for his packing though and he\u2019s gotten better but sometimes I just shake my head", "I have a holiday list that I use for every holiday with every necessary item on it. I pack everything in a big box, then transfer from there to the suitcase while crossing things of the list. I created this list when we had our first kid and the items a baby needs are lots.

We\u2019re talking about why the fidget toys were left at home in the first place.", "That\u2019s like saying someone in a wheelchair should be a little more motivated to walk, if they really wanted to get into a building without an access ramp. It\u2019s a developmental disability and the world is completely unforgiving about it.", "That sounds plausible. But what are the other neurotypes that are not ADHD and  autism?", "A developmental disability is a disability for life.", "Because enacting consequences *doesn't* make you an asshole; violating people's boundaries in the first place does.", ">I want to find ALL your triggers, set them off, and then pillory you for trying to stop me from doing so.", "I want to find ALL your triggers, set them off, and then pillory you for trying to stop me from doing so.", "The slime rule works with the bedroom rule. Slime stays in the room the niece sleeps in.

You are a stranger. And I don't have triggers, I don't suffer from PTSD. \n\nI actually have a 12 year old nephew though, so I'm viewing this through how I would react if he broke a rule in my home and made a mess. I certainly would not kick him out on his birthday over a mess on the carpet in an off limits room. But I guess I'm just well adjusted and have an even temperament.", "OP might very well understand that - she said she had them leave because she couldn't guarantee that this wouldn't happen again. If niece is prone to wandering in with the slime, maybe she'd do it again, and OP would have another mess to clean.", "Interesting deduction, *impressively* wrong. \n\nThis is the correct reaction to a poor impulse moment- and I've had a few. I can literally think of several occasions off the top of my head where I acted in ways this would be an appropriate response specifically due to my impulse control at that age. And, no she didn't do anything \"honorable,\" she did the bare minimum after fucking up. I'm not putting the kid down at all, but don't pretend she's some martyr.\n\nAs someone with ADHD, OP did the right thing. As someone with ASD, OP handled the situation gracefully. As someone who has been in both positions, OP is right and you are wrong in a way that suggests benevolent ableism.", "So you agree, it was the dad's responsibility to get the daughter's appropriate accommodations?", "In my house, we call that \"squirrel\"", "okay but the niece did it only once. \n\nand most of the comments seem to baby OP because OP has autism but they expect the 12 year old to be perfect.", "It's not a cultural thing. It's just a lie. If you got punished when you did something wrong, then you didn't listen. People aren't afraid of chanclas because they accidentally spilled something.\n\nMake it make sense. \n\nKids misbehave. \n\nALL OF THEM. \n\nPeriod. \n\nEvery child ever has disobeyed a rule at one point in their life, in private and in public. It's normal human growth and development and you don't have special Hispanic genes that excluded you in your family.", "So you agree that her behavior was bad, but kicking her out is not the right reaction? That's my whole point. Punish the kid in a reasonable way and let it go.", "So if your niece/nephew broke a rule in your home you would kick them out on their birthday? Is that how you treat your kids too? You can teach and correct behavior without overreacting.", "You have heard of a lose-lose situation, right?\n\nThat both parties in a situation can be \"in the wrong,\" so to speak?\n\nNot saying that's *necessarily* the case here, but it does have some applicability I think.", "Brother was probably the messy person, and HIS place is probably a pigsty, which is why he's so upset OP is enforcing boundaries.", "Good point. I do not agree with the consequences just for the child\u2019s behaviour. But since the slime had to stay instead of dad going to get new things, I would have to rethink. That\u2019s a bit much. I still wouldn\u2019t want to ask them to leave. We usually come up with tips and tricks to help navigate these things. In my world, there has to be a better solution that sending out from the home but all parties need to cooperate.", "There is adhd spectrum all through my family so please understand I\u2019m not coming from ignorance. \n\nYou are very black and white. I\u2019m not going to say wrong or right. Different things work at different times. At 12 years old, It\u2019s too harsh for me to condone, simple as that. I lead with compassion and nurturance.", "Yes, had OP allowed that instead of going straight to kicking them out we wouldn't be having this discussion. \n\nOP allowed this to happen by letting the slime in her house in the first place. If that was a boundary she is that concerned with she shouldn't have let it in the door.  As is she did and she set the 12 year old up for failure. \n\nEither way this comes back on OP for not managing the situation like an adult.", "Respecting an autistic adult's right to set boundaries in her own home is not \"babying\" her. And she's not obligated to give niece endless chances if niece already didn't listen the first time.\n\nThinking it's important to teach kids consequences is not \"expecting them to be perfect.\"\n\nIf anyone's calling the niece TA, THAT is way out of line. The only AH is OP's brother.", "Kid only did it once cause her ass got kicked out. We don\u2019t know how often this kid would have disregarded extremely simple instructions otherwise.", "I never said the don\u2019t misbehave ever, Im saying its possible for kids to behave when they are taught consequences. \n\nAnd you can believe what you want, you don\u2019t know my family or our dynamics. Not all kids are the same, not all parenting is the same and not all families are the same and that\u2019s okay. You can believe what you like but so can I \ud83d\ude09.", "*My* point was about how ADHD is not an automatic excuse to let bad behavior go, and that people with ADHD are capable of understanding rules. I never said anything about punishment. A startling amount of people don\u2019t bother to actually parent kids with ADHD because there\u2019s \u201cno point\u201d in correcting them, and it shows in how they behave and how they adjust to adulthood. Having ADHD isn\u2019t an excuse to just do what you want without any form of consequence, and it\u2019s not a reason to shrug and ignore someone\u2019s behavior. *That* was my point.", "Depends on the rule.\n\nI don't know that I'd personally choose that hill to die on, but I'm not OP.", "I want to find ALL your triggers, set them off, and then pillory you for trying to stop me from doing so.", "YOU are what happens when kids don\u2019t have consequences. \u201cAnyone who disagrees with my shitty behavior is an ASSHOLE!\u201d You fucking suck.", "I want to find ALL your triggers, set them off, and then pillory you for trying to stop me from doing so.", "The judgment for that is ESH, and we all deliberately chose not to vote that way.", "And the opposite of an award is a consequence. glad we could help the 12 year old in this conversation", "Yep, and there are consequences to mistakes. For kids, too.", "Between the person who was clear about their boundaries, and the person who broke those boundaries and made a mess doing so, the asshole is the second person. If rules don't have consequences then there is no point in having rules in the first place, because otherwise people will trample all over them.", "I disagree with your definition of 'asshole', but I'd rather be an 'asshole' by your lights than a FRIKKIN' DOORMAT!", "I know mot people here aren't agreeing with you. But this is a child. Children don't have the best impulse control for reasons they can't control. And this child has ADHD which makes impulse control much harder. Yes, she was wrong and she broke OP's rules. But this is a child, and his niece. Sometimes a little more kindness isn't the worse thing in the world. OP is within their rights to kick them out--but that is a-h behavior. Being right isn't always the right thing to do.", "I think if OP had canceled the whole trip because of her niece's mistake, THAT would have been too harsh and evidence of holding a grudge, and make her TA. But they still did all the planned activities for the niece's birthday. To me that's good \"parenting\" (aunting?) Kids need to both know that actions have consequences but family will still love you and want to spend time with you if you make a mistake.", ">At 12 years old, It\u2019s too harsh for me to condone, simple as that. I lead with compassion and nurturance.\n\nAh, so we're arguing with a holier-than-thou attitude, speculation, and not much else then? You could have led with that instead of pretending you're trying to add nuance to the discussion.", "OP sets up her niece for failure by...putting her own aversion to the slime aside to make her niece comfortable, and only makes them leave when the 12yo doesn't follow easily understandable rules regarding the slime. This sub is wild sometimes.", "And I fully agree with you, so I'm not sure why are you are arguing with me...", "I encourage you to do so", "I think I see what you were trying to do there, but you didn't quite land it. The Edit button is your friend.", "Most people on here wouldn't stop their cars if they saw me crossing the road, is my impression.\n\nBut I agree you with pretty much completely. Do what you do, but you might be an asshole for it. That's OK, but it sticks in my craw that OP asks the internet to tell them to ignore the plain facts in front of their face. Sometimes we choose to be assholes, it's all a part of the human condition.", "I see your point but agree to disagree on the severity of these consequences. I feel the same could have been accomplished leaving the child\u2019s dignity intact.", "I didn\u2019t mean to come off better than anyone, but I do come that way some sometimes so I\u2019m sorry about that. Leading with compassion and nurturance was a deliberate parental choice and looking at how well my kids have turned out makes me feel confident it is a strong approach.", "Yes she did. Addressing a potential problem like that before it becomes an issue would have prevented this. \n\nI have children, they have brought home slime, I know that it will eventually get in the carpet so I don't allow them to keep it. I know that if I allow them to keep it whatever happens with it is on me, not them. \n\nOP is an adult and had the opportunity to shape the situation for the best results and failed and is now blaming it on the 12 year old. That's a total AH move."]}
