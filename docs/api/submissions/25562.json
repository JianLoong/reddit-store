She expressed interest in tasting it, so I happily shared a piece with her. To my surprise, she really liked it! That's when I casually mentioned that the chicken was actually dark meat. Ever since then, she's refused to touch it again, claiming she doesn't like dark meat.\n\nI didn't think it would be a big deal, as she already enjoyed it before knowing it was dark meat. But now she's upset and thinks I tricked her into trying something she wouldn't have otherwise. I believe it's not a big deal since she liked it initially. AITA for sharing this information with her? \n\nEdit: to be clear, I'm not asking if I'm the asshole for giving it to her. I didn't \"trick\" her into eating it. She asked for it and I gave it to her without thinking. I don't care if you buy that or not. I'm a grown ass man who eats whatever is put in front of him with little thought as to what's in it and because of that I tend not to think to inform others of what's in something unless they specifically ask. I'm asking if I'm the asshole for telling her later when it occurred to me that it was something she doesn't \"like.\" I could have not said anything and she probably would have ordered and eaten something she \"doesn't like\" at a later date.\n\nEdit 2: Jesus Christ people are toxic. Half of the responses have me hating myself over not even understanding my question and half have me hating my girlfriend (/s). I should probably delete but it's kind of like a train wreck. I just can't look away.\n\nEdit 3: I'm amazed at how many people don't know what dark meat is.

My aunt also way prefers light meat but when I make stuff with soy sauce, she says she can\u2019t even tell (I did tell her in advance).", "Maybe I'm stereotyping but Anglo-Americans are fucking weird on this one.\n\nEVERYWHERE and I mean EVERYWHERE else in the world, people prefer Dark Meat, it has more flavor, it has more fat, it's more tender.  Chicken Thighs and Drumsticks ARE dark meat.\n\nI do not get the weird fucking distaste for dark meat.  Chicken Breasts (esp mass produced ones) are the most tasteless, flavorless, bland, crappy textured blob of protein.\n\nGo look up nearly every top chef and culinary expert, they will all say the same thing, Dark Meat, Thighs in particular are where it is at for Chicken, it's all the fat, the flavor and moistness and goodness in chicken.\n\nDon't get me started on people not eating Duck, Goat, and Lamb in most of America as well.  It's madness, madness I tell you.", "My aunt is 65 and still does this.  \ud83d\ude02", "This is the only answer I think OP needs. I wish I could upvote you a thousand more times. If you know you don\u2019t like something YOU SHOULD CLARIFY BEFORE ESTING SOMETHING. I don\u2019t know why there are grown adults who put blame on others instead of just clarifying what the food is before trying.", "Some dishes (like General Tso\u2019s) are better with dark meat. Would I saut\u00e9 a chicken thigh to eat on its own with a side? No. But if I\u2019m making a stir fry thighs are great. And if I\u2019m making soup I prefer to have both light and dark meat.", "People think I\u2019m this way, but I can automatically taste if something I hate is in a dish. If it\u2019s not one of a couple specific things I\u2019ll give it a try, but if it is one of those things, I\u2019ll know and I\u2019ll hate it. Mainly mayonnaise. I can\u2019t eat any Mayo based sauces or aiolis or salad dressing or hollandaise or any of that without gagging. Which makes me have to customize a weird amount of foods.", "Yeah, dark meat is usually a lot jucier and flavorful.\n\nOver here chicken breast is cheap and not popular because dark meat is tastier", "\u201cPuffins\u201d cereal is one of my favorite things in the world! \n\nLittle birds\u2026not so much.", "Recipe please!", "Try pairing with some fava beans and a nice Chianti", "Is this just an American thing? In Australia I have never heard someone call Chicken Thigh \u201cdark meat\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s white meat or red meat tf. Thighs and legs are better than breast anyway, Shits dry", "I don\u2019t think this is really a big deal tbh", "NTA, your girlfriend is acting like my 5-year-old nephew who ate dino nuggets almost every day for 3 years, then found out that they aren't actually dinosaur meat but are just chicken nuggets in dino shapes, and never ate them again because \"I don't like chicken nuggets\".", "How old are you guys?", "NTA.\n\nFunny how she ate something and only claimed to 'not like it' once told what was in it. Not your fault she doesn't pay attention to how some foods are made.", "NTA. What's troubling is, GF needed to \"reinvent history\" (a symptom of BPD, just sayin') in order to maintain her narrative that she \"doesn't like dark meat.\" And, she also needed you to be the villain - suddenly, instead of obeying her request, you \"tricked\" her. I'm not trying to read more into this, but if she often reinvents history, and actually believes she has been persecuted by others evil emotions, I'd be careful. So, a normal person would say, \"Wow! I've always hated dark meat, but that was really good!\" But to a BPD, two differing things can't be true, and someone must be the bad guy. INFO: Is this type of behavior common with her?", "NTA, also not really a big deal. Gf is blowing this out of proportion, don't be too hard on yourself. Seems like an honest mistake. If it hasn't blown over by now, it should soon. Otherwise gf is just very petty", "You monster! How dare you!\n\nNTA", "Most of the world understands that the dark meat is better tasting and moister than the white meat.", "NTA it's not like you fooled a vegetarian into eating meat.\nYou simply stated what kind of meat it was. She enjoyed regardless, so that's on her", "NAH. She doesn't want to eat dark meat and that's her decision. You didn't maliciously trick her into having the darkest of chicken meats in an evil plot.", "NAH. You claim you didn't think about the contents before you offered the food to her, and I believe you. \n\nAt the same time, I can see how she'd think you intentionally tricked her.", "> I could have not said anything and she probably would have ordered and eaten something she \"doesn't like\" at a later date.\n\nAnd you would be TA for doing that. What you need to understand is that taste is 100% mental. Our opinions of things can MAKE them unappetizing. If you were happily eating something only to find out horse semen was used in making it, you can then end up being outright disgusted with what you just ate, even though you were happily eating it beforehand. It is always an AH move to trick someone into consuming something you know they wouldn\u2019t want to consume. It\u2019s a consent thing.", "erm", "NTA. Its the difference between drum sticks and breast. What a sad life if drum sticks are beneath your palet. This is a petty argument and a stupid thing to be upset about.", "I will 100% admit to this...I once tried Calamari and it wasn't bad....but once I knew what it was, now i can't bring myself to eat it...but that's my problem and no one else's...", "Yeah I think it\u2019s kind of weird because it\u2019s not like OP tricked her into eating panda or something. Also I\u2019m sorry OP\u2019s GF but fried saucy chicken thighs are always going to be the most delicious thing you\u2019ve ever tasted.", "It\u2019s so slimy!!! I hate it.", "when I was 4 or 5 I could already read chapter books and such, and I had a national geographic about ocean life from my dad. I showed my mom the cool blue proto-eyes lining all around a scallops shell, because I knew it was her favourite food. she never ate them again (nor mussels or oysters, either) and over 30 years later is still so disgusted with that picture hahaha. she brings it up all the time!", "Chicken of the sea.", "MIL: \"Mmmmm...this pasta sauce is delicious! What's your secret\"?\nYou: \"Garlic\"\nMIL: *proceeds to fake vomit*", "You're awesome for not trying to force your kid to have stuff she didn't need. I understand sneaking veggies if they literally won't eat them but people also forget how strong everything tastes as a kid!", "I thought i was so picky and hated everything. Turns out I love food, my mom was just a terrible cook.", "LOL. Come on now. Chicken breast is white meat and chicken thighs and chicken legs are dark meat. It\u2019s darker in colour and higher in fat. That\u2019s why some obsess over only having dry chicken breast because it\u2019s lower in fat content.", "It's the greasy feel in the mouth. It's definitely has more flavor, but greasy.", "Yep. If it\u2019s white meat, better plan on seasoning the shit out of it.", "Americans grow up thinking breast meat is the best, when it's actually the driest and least flavorful part of the chicken", "My mom last weekend made hummus. When I asked why it was so watery and sour, it was because she didn't have tahini and substituted lime juice.", "I am picky and hate so many things... and also my mother can't cook. It was not a good combination growing up.", "Facts, I was told I was \u201cimpossibly picky and hated anything but pasta with butter\u201d\n\nNow as an adult I\u2019ll eat a bowl full of veg cooked properly, haven\u2019t had spaghetti with butter in half a year? Mac and cheese comes from the oven now, not a box, and chicken stir fry is almost always in my fridge", "To be fair fresh lime juice is often an ingredient in hummous recipes. If it was watery then she used way too much. I've often made hummous with no tahini and with lime juice and it's never been 'watery and sour'.", "NTA which is something I can't say about the commenters. I don't care if I'm \"childish\" and \"immature\", I want to know what I'm eating and even if it tastes good I have a fucking right to decide to stop eating it just because I found out what it is.", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 the only thing I'm going to need therapy for is the trauma of reading some of these comments.", "I've only had duck once, in a Chinese restaurant, and I just didn't care for it. Maybe it was the way it was prepared. I don't believe I've ever had lamb but I've always been told it's very bland and is why it's one of the few things you're allowed to eat when having an allergy test done.
