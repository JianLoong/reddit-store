But now she's upset and thinks I tricked her into trying something she wouldn't have otherwise. I believe it's not a big deal since she liked it initially. AITA for sharing this information with her? \n\nEdit: to be clear, I'm not asking if I'm the asshole for giving it to her. I didn't \"trick\" her into eating it. She asked for it and I gave it to her without thinking. I don't care if you buy that or not. I'm a grown ass man who eats whatever is put in front of him with little thought as to what's in it and because of that I tend not to think to inform others of what's in something unless they specifically ask. I'm asking if I'm the asshole for telling her later when it occurred to me that it was something she doesn't \"like.\" I could have not said anything and she probably would have ordered and eaten something she \"doesn't like\" at a later date.\n\nEdit 2: Jesus Christ people are toxic.
