He is lucky that he is not fired on the spot for breach of trust and confidentiality. Are you sure he is a adult or is he a kid?", "NTA. Your friend has a problem.  A grown man doing that has a serious problem.  That\u2019s not a prank and is cruel.  I\u2019m surprised he wasn\u2019t fired.", "NTA\n\nMaxime is a major AH and providing you're in Europe (which I suspect) this is a GDPR breach and could really put the company in trouble.\n\nAlso, pranking is not cool. Certainly not at work.", "NTA. You were right. This kind of behavior is unacceptable. Maxime has no claim on your support. And it's telling that the only arguments he can come up with for why he should be supported have nothing to do with the actual offense. He thinks you should defend him because you work with him, or that the director should defend him because he was senior to Daphne in their work. But he can't find one good thing to say about what he actually did, because there isn't one.", "NTA.\n\nWhat is this guy talking about?\n\n>Maxime didn\u2019t like it because for him, since he was in the restaurant before Daphne, the director shouldn\u2019t bave to defend the newbie like that\n\nThis dude lucky he didn\u2019t get fired for this. He got someone's resume to get their number to pull pranks? Daphne can and should sue this guy for even getting someone's confidential resume for dumb shit like this", "NTA because you are entitled to your own opinions, your co-worker shouldn't expect you to always agree with him.\n\nObviously you know this situation better than any of us on here, so if you personally feel, based on this knowledge, that it did constitute harassment then you are entitled to that view. Your co-worker shouldn't be resentful that you disagreed on something. Being able to disagree with others in a healthy manner is an important part of life.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Realised I made a typo.", "NTA. Maxime sounds like a jerk, and pranks calls are not funny - especially in the workplace. He should be fired because he's a liability to your workplace.", "NTA. \u201cMaxime\u201d is engaging in behaviour that in many places would be illegal, and is undoubtedly cruel and utterly immature, and his immaturity is reinforced by how he\u2019s reacted to being caught harassing strangers. Frankly, he\u2019s lucky he wasn\u2019t fired.", "Absolutely NTA. Is Maxime really that arrogant to think he's above harassment because of his seniority? Your boss is right, the company could have been sued for his childish bullshit, and how long he's been with the company has no place in a discussion that is about being a decent human being and not getting the company in legal trouble due to his immaturity.\n\nPlus, in or out of work, people who play with people's emotions by pretending to be someone who's in love with them are heartless jerks.", "NTA\nStalking is something terrifying to many people, especially women. Making someone believe they are in danger is never a good prank.", "NTA. Not sure about laws internationally, but using a personal phone number or other personal information given to a business for a specific purpose for any other purpose is illegal. On top of that, this is a particularly fucked up way to use it. And it's also concerning that he thinks morality boils down to doing whatever the fuck you want to outsiders and always siding with \"your gang\" or whatever. I'd fire him tbh, he seems dangerous.", "That's not a prank.\n\nFirst, he's not authorized to go in the office.  Second, he's looking at private information.  Third, he's wasting time while working.  Fourth, he's harassing people.\n\nSeriously, he should have been fired on the spot.\n\nNTA", "The \u201eprank\u201c is one matter, but an employee accessing personal data of applicants is reason enough to fire him on the spot. \n\nWhat else did he access but hasn\u2019t told anyone? Addresses of colleagues? Financial information? \n\nYou are for sure NTA, but your boss is a walking red flag if he lets \u201eMaxime\u201c continue to work for him.", "NTA. Maxime is a royal AH. We had a girl that started modeling that ended up with a stalker. She walked away from it and moved came to work for us. One of the Manager trainees started anonymously sending her flowers at work. She was terrified. He was losing it no one knew just thought he was a little strange from day one. Not funny or amusing.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
