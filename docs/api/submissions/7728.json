Now for the story : I (21F) am a waitress in this restaurant for a year. My co-worker (23M), I will call him Maxime, work here for almost 2 years. Maxime sometimes go into the office (where all the documents are) and pick a resume and call the number to do a prank. Obviously none of the superiors were aware of this. Sometimes his pranks will consist to call the person in the resume and make the person believed that he was a line operator or something like that. So, this time he called the girl (21F) we will call her Daphne, and pretended to be some dude madly in love with her. The problem is that Daphne unfortunately had a stalker in the past who would harass her and follow her everywhere. Obviously she was afraid but I don't know how, when she started working at the restaurant, she knew Maxime was the guy who called her. Her and Maxime explained themselves and the issue seemed to be done but our director who got aware of the issue had some explanation to do with Maxime. He took both of Maxime and Daphne into his office and he talked to both of them. When he was talking to Maxime, he told him that what he did was harassment and that Daphne could sue them and that he was lucky that she didn't. Maxime didn't liked it because for him, since he was in the restaurant before Daphne, the director shouldn't have to defend a newbie like that. I told him that what he did was wrong, even if he didn't knew about the past issues of Daphne, that wasn't a prank to be done in any circumstances. He was mad that I didn't sided with him, and weeks after the issue, he seems to still resent me a little because of it. So, was I the asshole ?\n\nEdit : for those saying I was TA for not telling on Maxime sooner, you're right, but one of the assistant of direction was aware of that and even did some \"prank\" with Maxime. So it was my word against a superior's. And I didn't wanted to risk loosing my job\n\nEdit 2 bc my boyfriend think it's necessary: Maxime had a change of behavior with me a couple of weeks ago. He would drive me back home after work, and when other would tease him about a relationship he would say that it was nothing serious. Even when other would tease him about him liking me, he will not denied it and be actually \"flirty\" (word by my bf) with me sometimes. My ex roommate was thinking that he liked me too bc when I had a sick leave for almost 3 weeks, he would always ask about me, everyday. During a \"gossip session\" when it was slow, both of my manager talked about his behavior toward me, and that they also thought that he liked me. One of the manager said that it was possible since it was a while since he insulted me (my ex roommate was the one who told me since I was not working that day). He had a sort of obsession too when I got a boyfriend. He would always ask about him and our relationship, and would want to see a picture of him. My ex roommate told me that it might be bc he wanted to know if something was wrong so he would try a move. I was kinda blind back then and not see it but as everyone would tell me that he might like me, I started to question it. My boyfriend think that Maxime had a sort of \"love\" delusion and that could explain why he still resent me", "created_utc": 1674125789, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10fyu4v/aita_for_not_siding_with_my_coworker_when_our/", "score": 979, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Calling Daphne probably gave her some anxiety, and just because she has tried to now laugh it off changes nothing - she could have sued the company because of his behaviour, \u201cprank\u201d or otherwise.  Why should the Director side with Maxime just because he has been with the company longer than Daphne?  It was not just once that Maxime was doing these prank calls.  Also \u201charassment\u201d doesn\u2019t mean just of the sexual kind., but also for annoyance, and causing anxiety amongst others.  You are not the asshole in this situation, he is.  He needs to grow up.  Pranks are done at someone else\u2019s expense, and even when they try to laugh it off it\u2019s often to save face and not look humiliated.  What he did was only funny to him.", "NTA but how does Maxime still have a job?? He shouldn't be messing with people's private info.", "NTA\n\nI'm amazed that Maxime was not summarily dismissed.   \nPersonal information being stolen, through unauthorised access to personnel files is a significant data protection breach.  If this happened in the UK or the EU, the company could be subject to prosecution and huge fines, under the GDPR.\n\nThat Maxime is on about his status and \"the director protecting a newbie\" shows that he is an AH and that he doesn't understand the severity of what he has done.  Maxime sounds like an idiot.", "She KNEW and is not the A? Well f\\* you.", "My boyfriend see Maxime resentment like a \"love\" delusional. Since he apparently liked me, he was hopping that I would agree with him idk", "He didn't get a warning after your boss called him in & said the business could be sued for harrassment?!!", "Nope", "I'm not defending him. I'm just saying that the director is wrong too for letting those documents exposed like that. But even then, Maxime should not have to use the private informations to do his \"pranks\".", "Don't they have locking file cabinets where this is?", "Maxine should not be using company phones, private documents, company time and the time of his fellow employees to play childish games", "France also has some pretty strong Data Privacy laws under European GDPR. Would be interested to know which would be the strongest here.", "They should.  Absolutely personnel files should not be accessible to general employees.", "No they're right I'm from France (even tho the names I picked are not their name) the tip here is optional so we share with all of the people who work that day, so the people who were cooking still get tips ^^", "We should, but since I guess they are lazy, they do not take time to put it in the files"]}
