{"id": 31049, "submission_id": "17w3csc", "title": "AITA for not reacting well to my sister's pregnancy?", "selftext": "I (23F) have an older sister (26F) and a brother (29M). My sister is currently the only sibling with a child, my two-year-old nephew \"Alex\".  I'm a full-time college student and work part-time. I also live alone, so I don't see friends and family as much, and I only go out occasionally because I have bills to pay and barely any spare time due to work and college. A few weeks ago, I decided to have a few days off from college for last week and my sister asked me if my nephew could stay at mine for the day as we haven't bonded, and I agreed. I should have mentioned this at the beginning, but I'm not really a kids person and prefer not to be around them. \n\nWhen Friday came, it was time to pick up my nephew so I could have him for the day. And it's beginning to get cold now, so his mother wraps him up in layers when he goes outside. After driving home, I took my nephew inside my apartment and got the layers off. I noticed the T-shirt had some writing and read it: \"I'm going to be a big brother\". I was happy for him that he was going to be a big brother; his mum and dad have been talking about planning for baby number two for a long time since he was born.\n\nA few hours later, my sister called me to see how he was doing and asked if I noticed anything about the shirt. I said yeah, I know he will be a big brother. She said, \"And?\" so I said congratulations. She hung up the phone immediately. About two hours after the phone call happened, I dropped my nephew off to his parents, and my parents and brother were there waiting, which was unexpected. My sister and her husband got my nephew to bed, and they came downstairs as soon as he was sleeping. My parents started arguing with me, calling me an asshole for the way I responded and telling me I should be over the moon that my nephew was going to be a big brother. My sister's pregnancy isn't the biggest news in the world. My parents and I argued for a bit and I left. They did blow up my phone for a while continuing to say my response was an ahole response. \n\nA few days later, my sister and her husband were on all the social media apps. My brother finally shared the news on social media and told all his mates he would be an uncle again. My parents and siblings are pissed with me still because I'm not announcing on Facebook or WhatsApp, which are the only social media app I use, that I'm going to be an aunt again. They're also pissed off that I'm not going around telling every Tom, Dick and Harry I'm going to be an aunt again.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAITA here, or are my family overreacting, which I think they're doing?", "created_utc": 1700081288, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17w3csc/aita_for_not_reacting_well_to_my_sisters_pregnancy/", "score": 407, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your family is overreacting. You don't have to be \"over the moon\" about her pregnancy nor should they expect you to be. It's not your kid and you don't have to be posting about it or telling anyone, that's up to the parents. Just be pleasant as you have been and you're fine. :)", "NTA. It's not only not their first child, but it's not your child - it's theirs. If anyone should be announcing it on social media, it's the parents. You have every right to not be elated for them.

This guilt-tripping lets them have a free babysitter. You.", "NTA. It's not like you said anything negative, and they can't dictate your level of enthusiasm for someone else's life event.", "NTA - your family is overreacting, a lot!", "NTA your family sounds exhausting", "NTA. It\u2019s so frustrating when family members expect other family members to react or live life the same way as them. They brand that person a problem when in fact it is them who are the problem. You\u2019re different people. It\u2019s ok to be you.", "NTA  \nBlow up their phones when you graduate asking them why they aren't broadcasting the news on every possible platform", "NTA this is some passive aggressive nonsense. Your sister could have told you herself that she's having a baby instead of doing this roundabout 'you need to bond with your nephew\" bit just to use him as a baby announcement. Does she do elaborate gender reveals that she posts all over instagram too?", "Your family is overreacting, I don't even understand what kind of reaction they expected from you? I would consider myself a kids person, and I think you're totally NTA. They're just being unreasonable.", "NTA\n\nIt isn\u2019t your child, it is your sister\u2019s.

Not everyone reacts and screams etc etc.", "NTA, your family is acting really strange.  It\u2019s not your baby, why would you be \u201cover the moon\u201d about it?", "NTA. I really don\u2019t understand why the world seems to think we all should like children. \nI don\u2019t. I congratulate people when they\u2019re happy to have kids, and I do fake a vague interest to be polite, like I would about just about anything else someone I care about is excited by.

As your sister was planning for number two, I think to see the nephew with that t-shirt, I too wouldn't have immediately thought that it means his sister is actually pregnant.\n\nAnd even if you immediately connected the dots, it's still fully ok to not 'be over the moon' about this.", "NTA. I get that some grandparents are extremely excited about grandkids, esp. the first couple. I do not understand when they get irrationally angry at anyone who doesn\u2019t treat the pregnancy/kids like it\u2019s the HIGHEST priority in their lives.", "NTA\nHonestly it might be insulting but they sound like total attention seekers. I'm not a kid person either and I get that some people don't get excited to the least (tbh I don't even know if I could handle a day with a kid) so whenever I hear someone is pregnant I pretend to be excited for them cause I know that for some reason they'd take it to heart if I didn't. I get why your sister got upset, but your parents? Totally unreasonable on their part. It's not like you said \"okay, so?\", you said congratulations. Your reaction was fine and you don't have to act all excited to feed their ego, don't get me started on the sharing on social crap.", "NTA. Your response was positive, and perfectly within the bounds of etiquette. Who cares if you weren't SQUEEing and bouncing up and down?", "NTA. You'll be an auntie and that's great, but it doesn't need to be on freaking CNN. Your family needs to get over it", "NTA - some people are super excited and some people go on about their day. You said congrats. It's not on you they were disappointed wtih your response. If they wanted a certai nreacting they should have written a script for you. \n\nThe petty side of me says make a social media post that says \"hey my sis is knocked congrats BIL that you guys had sex and the parts work.\" Bonus points if you somehow work into a conversation with your parents 'Isn't it great your daughter was defiled  by BIl and now is with child?'", "NTA.\n\nIt's not your kid. Beyond a brief \"congrats\" if they're happy about it, that's all the energy you need to muster for it. You are under no obligation to make it your whole personality like a weirdo.\n\nPeople expecting everybody to care about their kids as much as they do and then getting upset when they don't is so bonkers to me.", "NTA. I think that your family is forgetting that your sister isn't the main character in everyone's lives lol. Also, the fact that they are angry at you for not posting about the pregnancy is ridiculous. Just looks like they crave the attention.", "NTA it's their news to announce to the world not yours!", "NTA. You congratulated your sister. This expectation to do some kind of performative hoop-jumping on social media is ridiculous.", "NTA this child is not your children I understand why other people in your family is very excited about this child but you not asshole for don't do things like them. Not everyone wants to have children.", "NTA. I'm not a kid person, either; I'll never have them (my choice). When my sister & BIL got pregnant, I was happy for them. I hugged them both & congratulated them, as per polite custom. I didn't burst into tears or scream in joy; our moms did, lol. They're introverts & don't care about being the center of attention. Your sister sounds like that & your family enables her because she's the one with kids.", "NTA - I'm a total kid person and I think this is a very bizarre expectation they've saddled upon you!", "NTA.   I\u2019d think it was really weird if one of my friends posted about how they were going to be an aunt on social media, it\u2019s not like it\u2019s their news.", "I would be petty and send them this post stating \u201csee I am sharing with the world - they don\u2019t care either\u201d \n\nNTA", "NTA. Shit, I\u2019m a proud parent and I find your family\u2019s behaviour bizarre. There\u2019s nothing special that means you have to lose your mind over. Yay for them, but it doesn\u2019t affect you beyond adding another relation. Their collective reaction is super weird. My guess is you are just a person who isn\u2019t as emotive as them and they feel like they need to guilt you over it to change your behaviour, because they see it as something wrong with you. You do you and ignore their immaturity.", "Why the hell would you care? Much less announce it on anything? Don't babysit for her again. NTA.", "NTA. So your sister is the favorite I take it?", "NTA. My sister is pregnant with her third. Not only have I never once considered Instagramming about the state of her uterus, she hasn't either. \n\nI love my nephews, but I'm also not a big \"kid person\" and even though I enjoy taking them to the park or the swimming pool or whatever now and then or helping her out, they're not my business. \n\nBeing happy for someone who makes decisions you wouldn't want for yourself is fine, but also you can be happy for them without making a public song and dance about it either.", "NTA.

At all. \n\nYou don't owe your sister to share your undying enthusiasm over social media. But a \"Wow, congrats!\" is the bare minimum if you care about someone. Must be hurtful for her to see you dismiss her and show such lack of care. Imagine if you got your dream and you sister didn't bother acknowledging it.\n\nYou parents & family sucks for harassing you about it. They shouldn't pressure you to post on social media if you don't want to.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nyou are fine not to anounce your sister's prefgnancy on YOUR social media.", "Family is overreacting BIG TIME.\n\nYou said \u201ccongratulations\u201d, I guess because you didn\u2019t scream it with excitement that\u2019s not enough for them.\n\nYou are not obligated to announce it to the world and keep up their public image on social media.", "You congratulated her end of story. I love that your whole family forgot about this and they're upset because you don't act like a 5 yeard old with a candy. Honestly the whole thing about a baby (gender reveal and baby shower etc) is so fucked up. People act like Jesus returned and in reality all that happened is that everbody know about the gender.  I'm eagerly waiting to someone tell everybody on a party like that, that the kid is non binary or some shit\ud83d\ude02 (I have zero problem with the LGBTQ but some people just act like they're in sims). So if someone looking for an AH then you can just point at your family because they're and they need to apologize to you because the way they acted.", "ESH they shouldn't be expecting you to shout it from the rooftops, that's for them to do, but you could have been a bit more happy for them when you realized the news.  I can't believe you didn't call your sister when you saw the shirt and at least say congratulations.", "YTA. You see the shirt on your nephew and you first thought isn\u2019t \u201cOMG, I\u2019m gonna call my sister!\u201d? Do you like your family?", "Soft ESH\n\nYour sister shared what she viewed as fantastic, life changing news with you and your response was \"meh.\" If you shared with your sister that you received a raise, got your dream job or made the dean's list and her response was \"okay\" or \"meh,\" I would judge her to be an AH. Generally, unless something else is going on between you all, the normal response would be, \"I'm so happy for you!\" or \"Congratulations!\"\n\nYour family, on the other hand, sounds exhausting. You have no obligation to share your sister's news on social media. You have no obligation to tell anyone in your friend circle. Quite frankly, it's not your news to share and I have zero doubt that none of your non-mutual friends care that you're going to be an aunt again.", "NTA. You reacted better than all of my family when I announced my second pregnancy. My first baby is 12 months and second due next year summer. I was told too why was in such a rush to have a second one. Honestly I still effing hurts a little because planned or not it\u2019s still a blessing.", "YTA. It's your sister's pregnancy and she wanted to share the news with you. Your lack of enthusiasm and dismissive response was rude and hurtful.

She said, \"And?\" so I said congratulations\n\nHow hard would it have been to say congratulations when the sister asked about the shirt? rather than yeah I know and only congratulating when the sister said \"and?\"", "Not true", "Or find a video of two small kids trashing home in the worst possible way and post it with caption \"I can't wait to be the funny auntie who will teach them this, LOL\" and THEY will make sure to keep you away from their children", "So chocolate creampie  would be\u2026what I think?", "I agree. This attitude is just as lame as people who think their pregnancy should be the center of everyone's universe. As if the mechanics of reproduction mean it's not a big deal when a new life is coming into existence. I'm not into kids, don't care about babies, not planning to have any, but I can appreciate that it's important to the people involved. I'l never understand the desire to belittle other people's life choices.", "Thank you. It sounds like a teenager trying to be edgy.", "LOL *creampied* is a vulgar word? \ud83d\ude2d", "Or poison a river?", "Why does OP have to jump through the hoops her family set up for her? \n\nThis was a set up, they created a situation and just because someone doesn't react 'as wanted' doesn't mean they are wrong. \n\nShe was focused on taking care of her nephew rather than going OOOH OMG ANOTHER KID.  I think she was actually focusing on the right priority.  She did say congratulations.  \n\nI mean I honestly think if you want someone to know your pregnant instead of wrapping your own child like a present just tell the person directly.", "Search for plastic vuvuzelas with custom print \"big brother\" and post it as a gift you are considering getting your nephew for Xmass", "But doesn\u2019t know the correct way to use it.", "You sound like some who needs to be creampied.", "Saying \"congratulations\" rather than \"yeah, I know he will be a big brother\", is not jumping through hoops. And calling it that is insane. \n\nThe sister than having to say \"and?\" before she said congratulations is not reasonable and basically discounts the fact she said it at all. \n\nAnd I have no idea what you are talking about focused on taking care of her nephew, she was on the phone once she sister called regardless of what words she said. And she chose \"yeah, I know\" rather than \"congratulations\". That is not \"focusing on the right priority\" it's being a dismissive ass.\n\nThe family is ridiculous for expecting her to be genuinely excited or announce it on social media. But she is an asshole to."]}
