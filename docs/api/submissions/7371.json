Leave and be done with it.", "NTA - He clearly needs professional help. If these are consistent fights and he always cruelly insults you then you need to leave him because thats just plain abusive. Being hurt over the loss of a loved one does not give anyone the excuse to be abusive.", "INFO: I'm lost. Did your BIL die from issues related to weight? Is that why your husband keeps bringing him up when you are getting into fights about your weight?\n\nJust to be clear, your husband is already TA in this scenario, but I need more info.", "NTA\n\nHe\u2019s got his own demons to deal with. And he\u2019s taking them out on you.\n\nYou should\u2019ve followed through with your plan two weeks ago.", "NTA. That said, your husband clearly doesn't respect you or care about your feelings. Time to run for the hills.", "NTA. Run, OP! Ruuunn", "Info: How is his brother relevant to your arguments?", "NTA. In no way are you an AH. You husband is being cruel and abusive you. If he\u2019s still upset about his brother, he needs to seek professional help to work through his feelings.  You said you have considered leaving him. Maybe you should - this is not normal", "NTA are you kidding me? you need to leave him. these arguments shouldn\u2019t even be happening much less with this manipulative defense.", "Info: how does he bring his brother in the arguments?\n\nNTA either way, but I think it's important to know what he does so we can help you.

You do NOT deserve this and he needs a proverbial slap in the face, which separation would give him.

No one deserves that type of abuse.", " INFO: why does he keep bringing up his brother? Did his brother die prematurely due to weight issues, and he thinks you are headed down the same path?", "NTA. He is abusive in how he speaks to you.  If he loved you, he would not speak to you that way.", "NTA. This dude is abusing you. \n\nMy brother died 3 years ago.

But your husband is not a dietician and does not need to police your intake.", "NTA. Leave this guy. Seriously wtf. Arguments like this in a relationship are red flags and you deserve someone who loves you. This guy clearly isn't the one. Wtf does his brother have to do with your weight, anyway?

I also don\u2019t get why your dead BIL has any bearing on you and your husband\u2019s arguments about weight and sex and why he feels the need to bring him up.  I think you said he died several years ago.  If your husband is still traumatized over his death after the long of time, then I would think he would avoid bringing him up.\n\nBut - while your husband is entitled to bring up your weight because he cares for you and is concerned for your well-being (I assume he is being critical because you have gained some weight). He is not entitled to yell at you, degrade you or humiliate you.  Those aren\u2019t actions a loving spouse would take.  And at the end of the day, it is your body, not his.

You can love someone, but not be happy with the person at the same time. It sucks thou. \n\ni wish you the best of luck and hope we both find the power to deal with our issues", "The one I remember most clearly (only because I was on the phone with him and had friends with me to keep me grounded) was 2 weeks ago, he called me because I was ignoring his mean texts. (The texts were so mean it made my friend cry)\nI argued that the things he said made me feel stupid and were not how to talk to his wife. \nThen when I didn\u2019t back down, he mentioned out of nowhere how someone at his job was burying someone in a casket the same as his brother and said \u201cyou obviously don\u2019t give a fuck.\u201d And that day I ended up saying \u201cmaybe I\u2019m too hurt to give a fuck\u201d and hung up. \n\nToday? I\u2019m not sure how his brother came up because we were arguing in person. But he brings up how I don\u2019t know pain like he does despite my bad childhood because he\u2019s suffered from his brother and I\u2019m a \u201cphony\u201d who never knew real pain. Then asks me to imagine my brother being dead and says if my brother was dead I\u2019d feel the same as him and react to everything the same as him. \n\nAny time before that I always shut up and turn into a \u201cyes woman\u201d when he brought his brother into it, but these last two times I didn\u2019t. So especially today since it was in person, the fight went on for a long time.", "I\u2019ve had a coworker and two cousins offer their spare rooms to me 2 weeks ago when I was going to leave before. My parents also offered their basement (but I\u2019m trying to avoid that one) Tomorrow I\u2019m going to my cousins for a family thing and plan to talk to her. He\u2019s not allowed at my side of the family\u2019s functions anymore, so he won\u2019t be there.", "Girl, this man is abusive don't you see that?", "Ohhhhh I see. You can\u2019t **possibly** know his pain and he can\u2019t reasonably be expected to behave kindly to his wife because *his brother died\nseveral years ago.* Obviously everyone with dead brothers naturally becomes a dick and you\u2019re supposed to starve yourself to bring his brother back so he can stop being a dick about your old man body. \n\n\nHe\u2019s an abusive asshole. This is incredibly not okay for him to treat you like this or use his brothers passing as a weapon. Unless he decides on his own to become a completely new person, I don\u2019t see a healthy or happy future with this man for you.", "Oh wow, he is using his brother's death to manipulate you and downplay your feelings. I feel like there is a specific term for this but I can't think of what it's called, to use a more broad term, this is abuse, both emotional and verbal abuse. If you don't mind, how old are you and your husband? \n\nPlease listen to me, you deserve to be happy, you deserve to be treated with respect, you deserve someone that supports and encourages you, you deserve to have someone that truly loves you! I think deep down you know he does none of these things, he actively puts you down and minimizes your feelings. Love is patient, love is kind, it is not abusive or manipulative, love should not hurt. I am not one to suggest divorce easily, I believe in the vow we make when we enter into this arrangement. We vow to love and honor one another all the days of our lives. He has broken that vow, and you are no longer bound by it in my opinion. It's hard to leave, I know it is, but it's so much worse to look back on your life and realize that you have wasted it being mistreated and miserable. I encourage you to move on from this abusive, manipulative man and choose to make yourself happy. \n\nWe only get one life to live so live it to the fullest because none of us make it out alive. Good luck OP, I wish you the absolute best!", "I had an ex who did this.
