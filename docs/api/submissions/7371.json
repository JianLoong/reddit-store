He and I fought more over that. \n\nHe got angrier and told me I was an asshole for saying that. I told him I thought he was using his brother as an excuse to be mean to me.

I\u2019m curious how his deceased brother relates in the slightest to whatever your weight is. This makes zero sense. And honestly, your husband sounds like a dick. Why are you staying in this abusive relationship?", "NTA- leave him he's a dick and trying to manipulate you with his dead brother.", "NTA but why are you with him if he is abusive like this? Leave and be done with it.", "NTA - He clearly needs professional help. If these are consistent fights and he always cruelly insults you then you need to leave him because thats just plain abusive. Being hurt over the loss of a loved one does not give anyone the excuse to be abusive.", "INFO: I'm lost. Did your BIL die from issues related to weight? Is that why your husband keeps bringing him up when you are getting into fights about your weight?\n\nJust to be clear, your husband is already TA in this scenario, but I need more info.", "NTA\n\nHe\u2019s got his own demons to deal with. And he\u2019s taking them out on you.\n\nYou should\u2019ve followed through with your plan two weeks ago.", "NTA. That said, your husband clearly doesn't respect you or care about your feelings. Time to run for the hills.", "NTA. Run, OP! Ruuunn", "Info: How is his brother relevant to your arguments?", "NTA. In no way are you an AH. You husband is being cruel and abusive you. If he\u2019s still upset about his brother, he needs to seek professional help to work through his feelings.  You said you have considered leaving him. Maybe you should - this is not normal", "NTA are you kidding me? you need to leave him. these arguments shouldn\u2019t even be happening much less with this manipulative defense.", "Info: how does he bring his brother in the arguments?\n\nNTA either way, but I think it's important to know what he does so we can help you. But you need to leave. He os verbally abusing you.", "NTA. Your husband is abusive, it\u2019s not ok to bully you about your weight.", "NTA but why didnt you actually leave him? You're clearly smart enough to see and know this isnt healthy or okay on any way. Don't choose to be with someone who keeps intentionaly hurting you.", "NTA. It doesn\u2019t matter what your weight is, there is no excuse to be cruel. You are right OP his dead brother has nothing to do with him being cruel. Perhaps try couples/marriage counseling or talk with a women\u2019s refuge about his behaviour.", "NTA. He clearly needs counseling to deal with his grief, but honestly, I'd separate for a time too. You do NOT deserve this and he needs a proverbial slap in the face, which separation would give him. He would see that he clearly risks losing you and at that point if he doesn't start working on himself, file for divorce. No one deserves that type of abuse.", " INFO: why does he keep bringing up his brother? Did his brother die prematurely due to weight issues, and he thinks you are headed down the same path?", "NTA. He is abusive in how he speaks to you.  If he loved you, he would not speak to you that way.", "NTA. This dude is abusing you. \n\nMy brother died 3 years ago. I could not even imagine using his death in any way as leverage in arguments with my partner or with anyone else in my life. I don't know what context he's using his brother against you, but nothing would excuse this behavior.", "NTA, if you want to drop 160+ pounds instantly, leave that manipulative wreck of a human being. He's the real weight on your shoulders.", "YTA to yourself for not leaving his ass", "Obviously NTA.\n\nThere is something seriously wrong with him. I would suggest having him talk to a doctor but he seems violent, it may be best to leave.", "NTA but Y W B T A if you continue to stay with an abusive husband. He is using his deceased brother as a an excuse to abuse you. Leave him.", "Sounds like he needs therapy and instead of getting it he\u2019s projecting his sh*t onto you. You are NTA!", "NTA. Starvation diets typically don\u2019t have lasting results and just lead to disordered eating. Therapy is a great place to start and to examine your relationship with food. But your husband is not a dietician and does not need to police your intake.", "NTA. Leave this guy. Seriously wtf. Arguments like this in a relationship are red flags and you deserve someone who loves you. This guy clearly isn't the one. Wtf does his brother have to do with your weight, anyway? Why is he using his DEAD BROTHER, who you never met, as a standard for a ROMANTIC PARTNER? That's icky and weird.", "NTA. Dump your abusive fatphobic husband and celebrate with a triple fudge cake.", "NTA But you can lose 180 lbs or more with this one weird old trick called divorcing this asshole.", "NTA.  I also don\u2019t get why your dead BIL has any bearing on you and your husband\u2019s arguments about weight and sex and why he feels the need to bring him up.  I think you said he died several years ago.  If your husband is still traumatized over his death after the long of time, then I would think he would avoid bringing him up.\n\nBut - while your husband is entitled to bring up your weight because he cares for you and is concerned for your well-being (I assume he is being critical because you have gained some weight). He is not entitled to yell at you, degrade you or humiliate you.  Those aren\u2019t actions a loving spouse would take.  And at the end of the day, it is your body, not his. Until your weight is an issue to you, he needs to shut up. And then he just needs to provide support.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You probably love your husband and see the good in him. But love is never, ever supposed to hurt. Maybe your relationship can survive this - but really, it shouldn't. You're worthy of love and genuine support. Make a plan and get yourself free. We're all rooting for you.", "Good callout.

I got it in my head that I hadn\u2019t tried hard enough to be his wife.", "No. I asked and he said he brings up his brother because his brother affects every decision he makes. \nHis brother weighed about 120lbs, from what he\u2019s told me. And the results were inconclusive but suspected alcohol and pills to be the reason.", "I should maybe say I\u2019ve been this size the entire time I\u2019ve known him with some fluctuation but not much. (3 years now) I joined the gym 2 weeks ago and have been going. But I don\u2019t feel I deserve the comments.", "I don\u2019t get it either. We will fight about something usually sex or weight, or now the fact that I almost left, and then he brings up his brother out of nowhere.

My half brother thinks it\u2019s because I grew up with abuse (my mom\u2019s side, not his) my family is so mad I came back here. \n\nAnd I stupidly thought it would get better this time. Even with my life experience saying otherwise. He said when I leave, it\u2019s me running away from my problems and I need to grow up.", "Yes, let's shame and insult people because of a bunch of made up stuff from hundreds of years ago.

Not that this makes his behaviour in any way acceptable, just trying to understand more.", "So why is he bringing up his brother during fights?\n\nIs the scenario that he's verbally abusive and when you call him on it, he turns the tables and says you have to give him a break because he's grieving his brother?\n\nThat's an incredibly manipulative strategy called DARVO, meaning \u201cDeny, Attack, and Reverse Victim and Offender.\"", "I think it's time to walk away for good.", "That still doesn't make any sense.

I need therapy too, but for a set of other reasons, we all have to deal with our past in order to truly live the present. \n\nSecondly, people never change. They change opinions but not behavior like this. we are who we are, you either love your husband as he is today or you never will.

Yes that is subjective, yes I either clear my plate or save the rest for leftovers. He eats half his plate and throws the rest away.
