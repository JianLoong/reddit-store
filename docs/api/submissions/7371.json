Leave and be done with it.", "NTA - He clearly needs professional help. If these are consistent fights and he always cruelly insults you then you need to leave him because thats just plain abusive. Being hurt over the loss of a loved one does not give anyone the excuse to be abusive.", "INFO: I'm lost. Did your BIL die from issues related to weight? Is that why your husband keeps bringing him up when you are getting into fights about your weight?\n\nJust to be clear, your husband is already TA in this scenario, but I need more info.", "NTA\n\nHe\u2019s got his own demons to deal with. And he\u2019s taking them out on you.\n\nYou should\u2019ve followed through with your plan two weeks ago.", "NTA. That said, your husband clearly doesn't respect you or care about your feelings. Time to run for the hills.", "NTA. Run, OP! Ruuunn", "Info: How is his brother relevant to your arguments?", "NTA. In no way are you an AH. You husband is being cruel and abusive you. If he\u2019s still upset about his brother, he needs to seek professional help to work through his feelings.  You said you have considered leaving him. Maybe you should - this is not normal", "NTA are you kidding me? you need to leave him. these arguments shouldn\u2019t even be happening much less with this manipulative defense.", "Info: how does he bring his brother in the arguments?\n\nNTA either way, but I think it's important to know what he does so we can help you.

You do NOT deserve this and he needs a proverbial slap in the face, which separation would give him.

No one deserves that type of abuse.", " INFO: why does he keep bringing up his brother? Did his brother die prematurely due to weight issues, and he thinks you are headed down the same path?", "NTA. He is abusive in how he speaks to you.  If he loved you, he would not speak to you that way.", "NTA. This dude is abusing you. \n\nMy brother died 3 years ago.

But your husband is not a dietician and does not need to police your intake.", "NTA. Leave this guy. Seriously wtf. Arguments like this in a relationship are red flags and you deserve someone who loves you. This guy clearly isn't the one. Wtf does his brother have to do with your weight, anyway?

I also don\u2019t get why your dead BIL has any bearing on you and your husband\u2019s arguments about weight and sex and why he feels the need to bring him up.  I think you said he died several years ago.  If your husband is still traumatized over his death after the long of time, then I would think he would avoid bringing him up.\n\nBut - while your husband is entitled to bring up your weight because he cares for you and is concerned for your well-being (I assume he is being critical because you have gained some weight). He is not entitled to yell at you, degrade you or humiliate you.  Those aren\u2019t actions a loving spouse would take.  And at the end of the day, it is your body, not his.
