{"id": 10171, "submission_id": "1140nb9", "title": "AITA for refusing to let my son see his grandma?", "selftext": "\n\nI (19F) had my son in November. When I was 18, I met his father, Henry (23M), at fucking group therapy. Long story short, I got knocked up and we stayed together until i was 7 months along and then he decided he didn't want to be a father. I was obviously upset but he has the right to make the choice to not be a father. However, his family wanted to still be involved so I never stopped them from seeing my baby. His mother, Jackie (59F), has been particularly amazing up until a few days ago. She always offers to babysit so I can have time to myself. She was also apologetic when her son left me and she always says that I'm a part of her family.\n\nOn valentine's day, I went out on a date with a man called Ray (21M). We met through friends and I was reluctant at first because I just gave birth, but my friends told me he was nice and he understood that I wasn't looking for anything serious. I asked Jackie to babysit my son two weeks in advance and I thought she'd be glad to because she loves my son and often asks to see him randomly. I thought she'd take it normally because Henry left me and she treats me like family. She agreed, but every time I saw her afterwards, she made comments about me moving too fast and suggested that I try 'win' her son back. She also babysat for me on the 6th and when I went to pick up my son, I saw Henry holding him which he has **never** done. He's never shown an interest in him and he isn't even on the birth certificate so I was surprised, and even more surprised to learn that Henry had been alone with my son the whole day because Jackie was out. \n\nOn valentine's day, Jackie canceled on me an hour before my date. She's never canceled on me before so I suspected it was because of the date but she told me she was feeling sick. I called Jackie later to see if she was okay and she admitted that she lied because she 'couldn't endorse' my new relationship. I explained that it was not a relationship so then she said she didn't think it was right for me to be entertaining the idea of a new man when I have a child with her son. I reminded her that even she hasn't acknowledged Henry as my child's father because she respects his right to choose to not be a parent, but she said that she didn't expect me to move on so fast. She was essentially expecting me to be on standby for when Henry 'warms up to fatherhood' which I said was absurd because he **never** has suggested that he would consider being a father to my baby later on. \n\nWe ended up arguing and she called me a slut for dating again. I told her she couldn't see my son anymore and blocked her number. Now I'm being bombarded with texts from her family, calling me heartless for denying a grandma the right to see her grandson over an argument. When I say that she insulted me, they respond that she's an old woman and I should understand that this whole situation is unusual. They're demanding that I apologize and let her see my son.

If you don't have a formalized custody agreement or a termination of his parental rights on record you need to get to work on that with an attorney. \n\nYour instincts are in the right place, but you need to take some active measures to protect yourself and your child before some level of \"anonymous\" CPS reports start taking place like \"you're bringing a string of strange men around your child.\"", "NTA and don\u2019t let her have access to your son because she could use that timer to turn your son against you.", "OP you need to go to court & get an official child support order.

Likely on both sides. Avoid the court battle and reestablish your relationship with her so that it can remain on your terms.

As long as your kid is taken care of it\u2019s nobody\u2019s business what decisions you make otherwise.", "I did not mean alone without supervision. I meant without HER. Her baby is only 3-4 month old, and the last thing she needs a babysitter for is to go out with a new guy. Maybe in a few months, and I am not saying she should not have time to herself and maybe hang out with friends once and a while, but dating should be on the back burner until the baby is older.", "Oh my goodness if it's already hit that territory of harassment please speak to your cousin's partner as soon as possible. This is not something to wait on or give any time to cool off. No matter how clearly innocent you are CPS investigations can be very stressful and stem for a considerable amount of time. But if they threatened you in writing they've essentially made a very uncomfortable bed for themselves and they're going to lie in it once you have a lawyer working with you on this matter. \n\nIf they know where you live, it may be prudent to install security ahead of time if you have the funds for it. I am very relieved you've been screenshotting everything. I know I can sound paranoid and alarming, I have worked with children for many years and have had to cooperate directly with CPS before to give my piece so I've encountered some seriously terrifying moments where the wrong person was being focused in on. Make sure you back up those screenshots to a cloud service type like google photos or just back it up in two different places besides your phone like a laptop and USB. \n\nPeople who are willing to escalate to the point of threatening false CPS reports aren't going to de-escalate without outside intervention. \n\nI am so so sorry. I don't want to alarm you with this, and I want you and your child to be safe from these people. You don't deserve to be enduring any of this.", "yeah, he just writes me a check every month", "LOL oh I see, you're weird! She's going to go on dates, that's literally none of your business. She wasn't going to leave the kid with some stranger babysitting. It's literally the kids grandparent. You're purposefully trying to make it sound like she's ditching the kid with just anyone bc you don't want a young mother to be dating. It's gross of you.
