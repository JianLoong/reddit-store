Historically, her relationships are short-lasting and not very serious. But she speaks of her current boyfriend differently. In the couple months of their relationship, things have become serious. They are living together and have spoken about marriage and are in-love. \n\n\r  \nSo naturally, I ensured space for him at my upcoming wedding wanting to support her relationship and make them comfortable. The wedding is small and casual; close friends and family only. Invites have yet to formally go out. \n\n\r  \nYesterday, when on the phone with my sister, she revealed that her boyfriend is **65-years-old**. \r  \nI was surprised. Her boyfriend, afterall, is older than our dad, and her boyfriend\u2019s children are older than my sister. Her boyfriend even has an infant granddaughter.\n\n\r  \nI refrained from judgement as my sister has a history of forsaking those who do (fair enough). For example, my parents and family (who will be attending the wedding) have been nearly cut from my sister\u2019s life as she often feels they judge her and disapprove of her life choices. \n\n\r  \nNeedless to say, she has not revealed the age of her boyfriend to my parents and family, and they will meet him for the first time at my wedding. I imagine my family will be disapproving and upset; likely completely spoiling the mood of the wedding as my parents, mom in particular, is very sensitive and reactive. \n\n\r  \nSo now I\u2019m in a bit of a dilemma.

The actual wedding and reception had the million (obvious exaggeration) people required for my MIL to feel content in her ability to show off and live vicariously.", "I would rather hope that people knew what their role was prior to the \u201crehearsal\u201c.  For a bare minimum I would hope the bride knows the groom, the best man/ men, brides maid/s know who the bride and groom are, and also know what they are to do, and how to dress.\n\nIt helps if the parents know their child, and that all recognise that the wedding is tomorrow, plus the location.\n\n\nNaaah, it\u2019s just an excuse for a piss up a few fisticuffs, the best man shagging the goat on the lawn (no one ever knows where the goat came from), the groom being duct taped to some scaffolding, 30 feet up the side of a building, stark bollock naked - in Ohio, when the wedding is in the Bahamas. \n\nOh yes, the rehearsal ends up being a waste of time as the groom is locked up for indecent exposure and for being drunk & disorderly. \n\nThe groom is let out of jail, a month later, and the best man has eloped with the goat.", "more or less the same for me. it wasn't a full on rehearsal, but the couple would point out the venue, where to walk, location of each room that would be used by us, etc. \n\nand then dinner after.", "Yeah as far as I know the dinner tradition started off because you do need to rehearse a bit- who goes in what order, who\u2019s holding this, who\u2019s reading what. And of course after that rehearsal, the bride & groom want to feed people because everyone\u2019s gonna want a meal after an afternoon of wedding preparation and it\u2019s a nice gesture for the folks who are helping you on your wedding day. \n\nThen the tradition kind of evolved into a much bigger preparty for party\u2019s sake. Which is maybe unnecessary but who cares? Any excuse for cake is ok by me.", "A rehearsal dinner often does go through walk-through of the wedding. Which bridesmaid with which groomsman, the order of them, when the flower girl &/or ring bearer walk (and which adult corrals them after they have made their way. It's also when the bride and groom pass out the gifts to the wedding party.\n\nThose invited would be the wedding party, their immediate families, and any out-of-town guests that are around if they haven't made alternate plans.", "Sure. The Netherlands.\n\nWe usually celebrate the marriage on 1 day. The actual ceremony which is usually quite governed by etiquette. The diner and party afterwards a little less so. Usually it is the responsibility of either the weddingplanner, or a dedicated \"master of ceremonies\" (often one of the \"witnesses\", how we call out best man or maid-of-honor) that arrange the details with the guests (placesetting, who can speech, when can they do so etc.). The newlyweds are usually not bothered with the details and left to enjoy the happy feeling.", "All those huge parties aside, I bet your weddig was just as memorable and meaningful (if not even more so due to the more personal touch) as all those huge and over-the-top feasts. \n\nMy wedding was a smallish traditional Dutch wedding. 50 guests, a modes 3 course diner. We did have the luck of having the dress and suit donated by our parents. \n\nEven with only those 50 guests I still had the feeling that I didn't manage to celebrate it with all guests as much as I would have wanted. I just didn't have the time to spend with everyone. \n\nI bet you had all your truly important people around you, who were with you at every step.", "In the US it's very very common that not everyone is from the same religion so the rehearsal is to make sure people know what to do in the church/temple/synagogue/mosque, too. I had a Catholic wedding and a lot of non-Catholic wedding party members. All Catholic wedding masses are the same and they're pretty specific so the Catholics knew what to do but everyone else needed a walk through lol. I know if I was ever in a non-Catholic wedding I'd appreciate the same.", "sorry to give you the sad news, but best man and goat got divorced", "Must have been stressful for you.", "Yeah, but you see, this is the US.  In days of yore, the rehearsal was where they would make sure who would guard the venue against raiders, who would shoot who, and in general keep the party alive against all those evil crashers and people who would speak up when asked to or forever hold their peace.\n\n/s a fair bit obviously, but there *are* some real traditions to that that date back centuries.  And to countries besides England\u2026 think Viking weddings, for example, which could easily result in a (more or less friendly) brawl.  The US just hasn\u2019t\u2026 let go\u2026 of some of those\u2026 wonderfully bucolic traditions."]}
