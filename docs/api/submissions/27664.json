Historically, her relationships are short-lasting and not very serious. But she speaks of her current boyfriend differently. In the couple months of their relationship, things have become serious. They are living together and have spoken about marriage and are in-love. \n\n\r  \nSo naturally, I ensured space for him at my upcoming wedding wanting to support her relationship and make them comfortable. The wedding is small and casual; close friends and family only. Invites have yet to formally go out. \n\n\r  \nYesterday, when on the phone with my sister, she revealed that her boyfriend is **65-years-old**. \r  \nI was surprised. Her boyfriend, afterall, is older than our dad, and her boyfriend\u2019s children are older than my sister. Her boyfriend even has an infant granddaughter.\n\n\r  \nI refrained from judgement as my sister has a history of forsaking those who do (fair enough). For example, my parents and family (who will be attending the wedding) have been nearly cut from my sister\u2019s life as she often feels they judge her and disapprove of her life choices. \n\n\r  \nNeedless to say, she has not revealed the age of her boyfriend to my parents and family, and they will meet him for the first time at my wedding. I imagine my family will be disapproving and upset; likely completely spoiling the mood of the wedding as my parents, mom in particular, is very sensitive and reactive. \n\n\r  \nSo now I\u2019m in a bit of a dilemma.

The dinner is to have fun meeting each others side. Hopefully fun anyway.", "Rehearsals make more of a difference than people think, especially with religious weddings or weddings with a lot of ceremony. I\u2019ve played violin for weddings that skipped the rehearsal and watched the bridal party awkwardly go to the wrong sides after walking down the aisle, or flower girls get confused and try to run to their bride or their parents asking where to go, etc. I had a Jewish ceremony that had multiple ceremonial components, including a series of blessings each read by a different family member; the rehearsal avoided pauses as people figured out where to be and when, so the ceremony took about half as much time as the rehearsal. Pacing certain things to match the music helped a lot too \u2014 my brother and a bridesmaid contributed to the music, and they got to see approximately where in the songs they should fade out.\n\nEven if you don\u2019t need to really rehearse, a rehearsal dinner has many benefits:\n\n1. The bridal party usually arrives a day or two early to avoid transportation issues the day of, and to give time to get ready the morning of. A rehearsal dinner is a great way to avoid leaving them to fend for themselves for the dinner when they spent extra time and money to make your day special.\n\n2. Often, especially with large weddings, the couple only gets 2-5 minutes with each guest during the actual wedding, less if they spend more time dancing than greeting. A rehearsal dinner is a chance to celebrate more intimately with their closest friends and family.\n\n3. In the case of a more DIY wedding, a rehearsal dinner is a nice way to feed anyone who comes to help with setup. \n\n4. It\u2019s a chance to do more without making all your guests sit through a million toasts. Often people who aren\u2019t giving a toast at the actual wedding will give one at the rehearsal dinner, where everyone is close enough to the couple to actually want to hear it. If every member of the bridal party wants to say something, that can be long and boring for more distant guests. \n\n5. The couple spends the night before (when they may be stressed or too excited to relax) surrounded by their closest friends and family. The relief of a rehearsal going well can also reduce anxiety so they\u2019re more likely to actually sleep that night.\n\n6. In some faiths, there are multi-day steps to the wedding. For example, in Judaism the bride (and groom? My ex husband didn\u2019t\u2026) are supposed to go to the mikvah (sort of a cleansing bath? It\u2019s hard to explain) before the wedding. I know people who\u2019ve done really beautiful things for their mikvah with their bridesmaids/groomsmen the day before, so having a rehearsal dinner is again a nice way to thank the people who came early for those day-before moments. \n\n7. People often just want to spend more time together leading up to a wedding. Rather than folks texting one another separately to see who wants to meet up (potentially accidentally excluding someone they would want to include because they don\u2019t know they\u2019re invited/in town/available), a rehearsal dinner is just a more organized way for the people closest to the couple to gather.\n\n8. This is sometimes the first time the bride\u2019s family and groom\u2019s family really meet, especially if the bride and groom are from different places. The more comfortable the family and bridal party are together, the more comfortable they\u2019ll all be celebrating together at the wedding. Usually weddings I\u2019ve seen where there was a rehearsal dinner have more lively receptions as the core people already have some bond (and maybe some inside jokes!), so there mingling more and dancing together rather than the reception room becoming awkward and divided. \n\n9. Where I grew up (idk if this is everywhere), tradition was supposed to be that the bride\u2019s parents paid for the wedding and the groom\u2019s parents paid for the rehearsal. This isn\u2019t necessarily common practice anymore, but I suspect it in part came about in part as a way for the groom\u2019s family to contribute (and maybe show off a little) without seeming to be trying to overshadow the wedding or the bride\u2019s parents.\n\nThat\u2019s what I can think of right now, but I\u2019m sure there\u2019s more. I definitely recommend rehearsal dinners (and rehearsals, except for very small ceremonies), even though they\u2019re not free. For me, I think it was my favorite part of the wedding, especially because my bridal party was from various states (and stages of life), so seeing them so comfortable with each other on the dance floor the next day was really heart-warming.", "When there is a wedding here we have a \"rehearsal\" so everyone in the bridal party knows their position and place during the wedding and what the program is.  This can vary from religion to religion and culture to culture.   The rehearsal dinner is after the rehearsal and is for the Bridal Party and close family", "For my (Catholic) wedding, the rehearsal was going to the church so everyone knew the correct cues for the actual wedding, since it\u2019s a specific type of mass. The rehearsal dinner was just the wedding party going to a nice, celebratory dinner after that.", "For every wedding I've been in, there's been a meeting with the minister to make sure we know how to walk down the aisle, what order the wedding party will enter, what order the service will be in, that any music happens on cue, ect. It's like 30 minutes. And then the wedding party gets dinner together afterwards.", "At mine, we went to the venue first and ran through music cues for the bridesmaids and me.

Then we went to a restaurant and ate.", "As a fellow European, I don't understand either why they need to practice eating in a formal environment", "LOL I love this comment so much thank you for the image", "It\u2019s a gimmick someone came up with to get people to waste even more money on big weddings. By having more events before the wedding.", "It\u2019s a run through of the ceremony followed by dinner. The order things will happen, who stands where, etc etc", "There is usually a wedding rehearsal the evening before the big day and afterwards there is often a dinner which usually includes the wedding party and spouses, parents, immediate family members, and out of town guests (at least where I'm from). Others can be added, of course, including the priest/preacher.", "For my wedding it was important to do a rehearsal since I had a more Buddhist ceremony in a temple. We had to go over the incense offerings, how to do the sake ceremony, the order of ceremonies, etc. Plus, it was good to have the wedding party and parents go over waking order and determine where everyone was standing. Then afterwards having the opportunity to have a nice calm meal with the wedding party, and parents was really nice, especially given how crazy the wedding day is. I don\u2019t think every wedding really needs a rehearsal, but it does help get some jitters out. I think some people just keep the dinner part. It\u2019s a nice tradition!", "This is actually a good point that I\u2019ve never even considered. It\u2019s just a dinner the night before for the wedding party and immediate family. \n\nSeparately to this I once attended a practice walkthrough at the celebrants house well prior to the rehearsal dinner, where we literally took ten minutes running through the ceremony and who was saying what and when.  That was actually a rehearsal but wasn\u2019t named as such. I\u2019ve never done this again despite being in several wedding parties.", "In many cases, it's a formality for the families and wedding party to go over any special requirements from religious parties that are performing the service to inform them of what is expected and how they should respond. It is especially important when the bride groom are not of the same religious backgrounds and have chosen to have a church service. \n\nThey \"rehearse\" their parts, with the wedding and families because in cases they have roles in the service. When they are done, everyone goes out for dinner, as way of getting to know each other before the wedding. The rehearsal dinner is can be done anytime before the wedding, usually within the week of it. The parents of groom usually pick up the tab.", "The rehearsal is a quick fifteen minute run through of where to stand when.\n\nThe rehearsal dinner happens after, and is traditionally hosted by the groom\u2019s family.  It is for the bridal party and the families of the couple.

The church's regular organist had fallen ill or was called away or something, so a different organist was filling in. My sis realized at the rehearsal that the pinch-hit organist could not handle the music my sister and her husband had chosen, so they made a last minute change. She was very glad to have learned this the night before the wedding and not at the wedding itself.", "It's the night prior . If you're poor it's the night you decorate the space and practice walking down the aisle and rehearse everything and it's followed with food.", "Could you keep us posted please?\n\n\nI hope your wedding is beautiful and drama -free. \u263a\ufe0f", "I wouldn't say that.

I look at 16-19 year olds and they're children whose ages I struggle to tell apart.

My family often has dancing at the rehearsal dinner too to teach their non-Greek friends how to Greek dance, which is always fun! \n\nBut it\u2019s also useful to rehearse the actual wedding, both because Greek weddings have a lot of moving parts and because, especially in a multicultural country with so many different wedding traditions, a lot of times the bridesmaids/groomsmen/family of the bride or groom aren\u2019t familiar with how a Greek wedding goes.", "Idk, I guess it\u2019s to make sure everything is set in stone, and resolve any problems that could arise during the actual wedding", "Your language seems pretty judgemental.
