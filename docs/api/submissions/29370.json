{"id": 29370, "submission_id": "17d4or4", "title": "AITA For Making My Dad Walk Out On His Own Birthday Dinner?", "selftext": "I\u2019m going to preface this by saying that while I (22F) love my dad (60M), we have a complicated and difficult relationship, and it\u2019s been made worse in the last few years for various reasons. Something he tends to do (with most other people, not just me) is act like he is always the most correct and fully informed person in the room. His facts and opinions are the only right ones and he will not hear anything else.\n\n2 weeks ago I flew back to my home state so I could visit my family and take my father to dinner for his birthday. I made us reservations at a steak place he loved. I bought him a beer, we got caught up with each other, and then it came time to order. He ordered his steak well done, and I ordered mine rare. The problems started immediately after, when he told the waitress that I don\u2019t really want that and I\u2019ll have mine medium well. I laughed because I was hoping he was just messing around, and I said no, I wanted rare. The waitress finished taking our order and left, and my dad started up with \u201cwell if you get sick tonight it\u2019s not on me\u201d and it turned into an argument about food safety and steak. \n\nMy father has this ridiculous belief that rare steak and rare ground beef are the same and that BOTH can get you sick, despite foodborne illness not working like that. I\u2019ve had a certification in food safety since 16 and have worked on and off in food service for years (back on for the past year), but despite my experience and knowledge on this topic, he refuses to listen to me and always belittles me and says I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m talking about or something to that effect. That same thing happened during this argument, during which I tried to remain polite and levelheaded and steer the conversation towards anything else, but he wouldn\u2019t let it go. Finally, when HE was ready to be done with it, he said that it\u2019s not my fault I\u2019m younger and don\u2019t know any better. I told him it\u2019s not my fault that he\u2019s ignorant and hard-headed and can\u2019t stand to listen to anybody else but himself.\n\nI guess he also hit his limit (he does have a history of anger issues) and he got up and left. We\u2019d taken his car so I was stranded, but my mom lives in that town so I called her and she came and ate with me and we took my dad\u2019s meal to my grandma (mom\u2019s side) and we chilled the rest of the evening. I tried to just let it go until my dad cooled down, but he didn\u2019t really. I\u2019ve gotten one text from him since it happened and it was a long paragraph about how I disrespected him in public and embarrassed him. I left him on read. I feel like after so many years or acting like this that he had it coming, but a couple family members agreed that it was an asshole move because it was his birthday. I\u2019m split.

He also disrespected you in public but it sounds like he feels entitled to do so because you're 'young'. The distance while sad and painful, may be what's healthiest for you.", "NTA. The ages are wrong but his could be my idiot father, right done to the ruined steak. He\u2019s a grown man. He went and had a pout. Grown men do not go off in a pout when he is proven wrong. They also don\u2019t leave people stranded like that.", "NTA\nYour dad sounds obnoxious and exhausting.", "NTA.  You are right that he had it coming, just like most blowhards.  He wouldn't let it go and this is the result.  Honestly, I wouldn't spend much time with him in the future, especially in public.", "NTA.\n\nYour Mom divorced this guy, and I can't blame her one bit!", "NTA\n\nBut your father, on the other hand...    *oh boy*", "NTA \n\nStop hanging out with him, even if it's his birthday.  Yeah, yeah, he donated some sperm back in the day, however (read this and repeat until you see the simple truth if it) that act of horniness on his part, did not create in you any obligation to put up with his shit and abuse.", "NTA.  You took him out for his birthday and he was an AH.  Your response wasn't even rude.\n\nEnjoy the peace and quiet.  Leave him on read forever.", "NTA. Sounds like my dad, who is textbook NPD.", "NTA.", "NTA. You didn't \"make him walk out,\" he chose to walk out due to having a disagreement/meltdown over what his adult son chose to eat. (And left you stranded.) That it was his birthday is beside the point, it sounds as if he would do it any time. You put in the effort, he didn't. It's not your fault he can't comport himself in a respectful adult to adult conversation without making it \"thing.\" I'm glad you didn't let it spoil your night, it seems he's good at that.", "NTA your dad sounds like a narcissist or at least someone with some narcissistic traits. It\u2019s not your fault he decided to make a big deal over this, and it was rude of him to leave you stranded over it. Don\u2019t blame yourself; he\u2019s clearly got some issues.", "If you tried to steer the conversation away from conflict, I'd lean towards NTA.\n\nInsulting each other at the end didn't help but we all have our limits. \n\nIf I were in your shoes, I'd tell him you understand how he feels embarrassed and disrespected by what went down and that you didn't want a public argument which is why you kept trying to steer the conversation away from an argument. You can also tell him that he is not the only one who feels disrespected by the situation.\n\nIt might not make a difference, but at the very least you can stand up for your feelings.", "Nta. He\u2019s the one in the wrong in so many ways. Your dad sucks bro.", "NTA.  He's the one that started the argument, didn't respect your choice, then got up and left.  How is that on you??", "NTA.  If he didn't want to air the family laundry in public he should have kept his mouth shut and enjoyed a birthday dinner.  These folks dish out disrespect like it's going out of style and then cry foul when anyone calls them on their shit.", "NTA - good for you! He embarrassed himself. If he was right, half the world's population would be dead ; and rare wouldn't be served. I can't stand know it alls - plus he pulled the age card.", "NTA.  Your dad's an AH.  Good for you on standing your ground and him having to leave because he lost the (incredibly stupid - because you were right) argument.", "NTA.  People who order well done steaks should be banned from eating beef in general.", "NTA. He was so in the wrong. I used to have a friend like that. He could never just agree to disagree. That's why we're no longer friends, lol. I hope that steak wasn't expensive, if you're going to order a well-done steak, you might as well eat shoe leather.", "NTA, but there's a time and place for everything. Next time be a yes-man until after his birthday, then you can let it rip.\n\nDon't let important occasions be ruined by arguments that can wait. In 10 years you'll remember the dinner was ruined, but you won't be able to remember what caused the argument.", "Your dad is not wrong that a rare steak can make you sick; a rare steak can absolutely make you sick just like ground beef.  While the likelihood is much much less, it can and does happen.  As a former restaurant owner, food safety is a top priority and it would be misguided to say anything different.\n\nWith that said, NAH.  You were going by your own understanding and your dad his.", "ESH. Did you know it takes two to argue? You can simply choose not to participate. Your dad is totally wrong and unreasonable BUT if instead of insisting on his wrongness, you use phrases like \u201cAgree to to disagree\u201d or \u201cI understand your argument and am taking full responsibility for the consequences of my rare steak eating actions\u201d the fight simply can\u2019t progress. I understand this can be frustrating in practice, but by choosing the fight you ensure that you spent a bunch of time and money only to get it thrown in your face. And for what? I come from a family that loves to fight so that seemed normal to me. But my husband flatly refuses to fight with me because he is secure in his opinion. Because of that if I get upset he will listen, state his position, and if he still thinks he\u2019s right do whatever he was gonna do. If he thinks what I\u2019m saying has merit, then he\u2019ll change his stance. But he will not ever ever argue with me and it works like a charm. I get my frustration out and we never ever fight. I have since used this same tactic in other potentially fraught situations and I can tell you it works like a charm.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
