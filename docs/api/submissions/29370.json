His facts and opinions are the only right ones and he will not hear anything else.\n\n2 weeks ago I flew back to my home state so I could visit my family and take my father to dinner for his birthday. I made us reservations at a steak place he loved. I bought him a beer, we got caught up with each other, and then it came time to order. He ordered his steak well done, and I ordered mine rare. The problems started immediately after, when he told the waitress that I don\u2019t really want that and I\u2019ll have mine medium well. I laughed because I was hoping he was just messing around, and I said no, I wanted rare. The waitress finished taking our order and left, and my dad started up with \u201cwell if you get sick tonight it\u2019s not on me\u201d and it turned into an argument about food safety and steak. \n\nMy father has this ridiculous belief that rare steak and rare ground beef are the same and that BOTH can get you sick, despite foodborne illness not working like that. I\u2019ve had a certification in food safety since 16 and have worked on and off in food service for years (back on for the past year), but despite my experience and knowledge on this topic, he refuses to listen to me and always belittles me and says I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m talking about or something to that effect. That same thing happened during this argument, during which I tried to remain polite and levelheaded and steer the conversation towards anything else, but he wouldn\u2019t let it go.

I'm retired now after 33 years, but at the time of the public argument, I was a USAF Avionics Specialist for (at that time) 20 years. My niece's youngest son asked if an aircraft's autopilot actually flies the plane. My mother chimed in with, \"No, it only keeps the plane flying in one direction.\" I responded with, \"Actually, it does fly the plane.\". She started in on me about how I don't know anything about the subject, to which I fired back with the fact that I had 20 years experience in the field and I have an Associate of Science degree in the field as well. She then brings up my uncle (by marriage), who was in the Army Air Corps during WWII, and that he told her that was how autopilot worked. I pointed out that technology has long since changed and that it indeed does, and that again that was the career field that I was in, and that I indeed DO know what I'm talking about. That's when she started the similar speech that you went through about her being an elder and knowing more than me despite my qualifications. My niece then decided to fire up the internet and proved that I was indeed right. My sister finally chimed in and said that I was indeed right and that she needed to realize that she didn't know everything. She then proceeded with how she wpykd have had such a better life if she had not given birth to my sister and me.
