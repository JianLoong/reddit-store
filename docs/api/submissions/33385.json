This would be her first time meeting my gf and we made plans to get dinner with gf\u2019s family her last night in town. Today, my mom called to express her concerns about common law marriage in Texas (my gf and I live together) and accused my gf of trying to manipulate me to gain control of my assets. This upset me, since she has never met my gf and barely knows anything about her. I called her crazy and she asked me to cancel her flight, but then backtracked when she realized she couldn\u2019t get a refund or credit. She requested that I kick my gf out of our house for the duration of her stay, and said that she would not meet her parents as originally planned. \n\nMy gf is disappointed as she bought non-refundable gifts and prepared several vegetarian dishes for my mom so she could be comfortable during her stay. Gf said she doesn\u2019t want to drive a wedge between my mom and I, and offered to leave when she visits. I, however, realized that I don\u2019t want to deal with my mom\u2019s drama if she did come and also don\u2019t want to make my girlfriend leave. If I cancel her flight, I would send her back the $200 she gave me for Christmas.

She also already requested the time off of work, so those are days she wouldn\u2019t make income.

Your girlfriend is not the one driving the wedge between y\u2019all. Your mom\u2019s got that covered all on her own.\n\nIt\u2019s fine for your mom to mention common law. It\u2019s always good to be informed.

Is this your home or you and your girlfriend\u2019s home together?  Either way, your mom is completely in the wrong. She did not bring any of these concerns up before buying the ticket?  Who exactly paid for the flight?  Because you said you would cancel, but she would not get a full refund?  Your mother made her choices.  They are hers to deal with.  I would tell her she either comes and behaves like a grown, mature adult or she can stay home.  The choice and repercussions of that choice are hers to make and deal with.", "NTA\nYour mom is unhinged if she thinks for one minute it\u2019s ok to ask someone to leave their own home so you can visit.

I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s jealousy or what, but do not let her undermine your relationship.", "NTA - but is this out of character for your mom? I'd be a bit worried she's showing signs of dementia, which can sometimes look like paranoia or severe anxiety in the early stages.", "NTA. Your mom can backtrack what she said until the cows come home, but your GF will NEVER forget what she said. How do you suppose the visit will go if she does show up? I imagine your gf will be very uncomfortable knowing what your mom thinks of her. Return your mom\u2019s ticket and show your gf that you will not tolerate any negative talk about her.", "INFO\n\nI'm confused. You said SHE booked the flight. How can you cancel it?", "NTA - your mother has manipulated the situation so she doesn\u2019t have to share you with anyone at Christmas. \n\nShe\u2019s suddenly brought up your living arrangements now, and can\u2019t cancel the flights? Sounds like a shake down. \n\nStick with your girlfriend and tell her that you are disappointed in her behaviour and won\u2019t allow anyone to kick your partner out of her own home.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Asking that your GF be kicked out is a huge overstep and very disrespectful to your relationship. \n\nThere is however a possible seed of wisdom in something she said though. Do look into common law marriages. A lot of states did away with them, but a few do have them on the books.", "NTA she's doing alot of weird old time talk", "YTA - Canceling your mom's flight would likely escalate the situation, and it may lead to strained relationships. Instead, consider having an open and honest conversation with your mom about boundaries and the importance of respecting your relationship. Cancelling her flight might be seen as an extreme measure, so try to find a compromise that maintains family connections without sacrificing your own values.", "Don\u2019t do anything yet. \n\nCall your mom back tomorrow and discuss it again.  \nMaybe tell her that you know she gets anxious at times and is she nervous about meeting your gf and / or her family. Is she nervous about being in the house with your gf because she doesn\u2019t know her, or she\u2019s afraid your gf won\u2019t like her, or she\u2019s nervous because what if she doesn\u2019t like your gf, etc. Talk about where all her crazy talk came from. \n\nSee if this visit can be salvaged. You\u2019ve obviously been with your gf for a while if you\u2019re living together, so I\u2019d like to think you would like your mom to meet her. \n\nIf, on the other hand, you and your mom don\u2019t have the best relationship and you\u2019d just rather not deal with her - again- then cancel and send her back the money.", "NTA, cancel that ticket.

Your mom is WAY out of line. Paranoid, controlling, and nasty are just a few of the words that spring to mind.

I looked into it after my call with my mom, and the law in Texas only applies if both parties agree to enter a common law marriage (with proof), according to the articles I\u2019ve read.
