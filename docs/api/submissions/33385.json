This is a VERY slippery slope that your mom wants to start. It is literally only the beginning of it. If you let her dictate your relationship in any way, she will go further and further.

You both need to communicate fully, be on the same page, and set boundaries with what you decide are appropriate punishments if she breaks those boundaries. You may also want to look back over your relationship with your mom and how she treated you.

Kept my mouth shut, because ultimately they knew what some of us thought and it was important enough to them to have sex before marriage that they did it anyway.  You don't fight that battle, because you've already lost it.  If you keep going after that point, you're going to lose an awful lot of people in your life, because waiting until marriage is not the norm anymore in the western world.  For that matter, more people are deciding never to marry at all.  \n\nYou clearly don't share your Mom's beliefs.

If not, you can then NTA. All this conversation about commonlaw or not is redundant. The real question is do you love your gf and support her? If yes,  nobody comes between you. I am married to a man who gave up his terrible mom for me. Facts are people who treat others poorly are bad people, whether they are related to you or not. Make your choice and stick with it.", "You are NTA for cancelling but you are TA to send back only Xmas gift if  the flight is cancelled. Have some respect for yourself and send her back the flight money and the gift money.", "OK have a serious discussion with your mother. Ask her why she thought this. What brought on this thought process. Tell your mom that you can guarantee your lady is not like that. She may have seen a few videos on the news about scammers then let her worry cloud her judgment. Talk to her one last time. See what happens.", "Merry Christmas, OP your going to need it... NTA", "NTA.  She created this issue, not you, and it's important to set the precedent that she's only welcome when she's respectful of your relationship. \n\nUnless she's a shift worker she can cancel her leave and work that week. You refunding $200 of the ticket is very reasonable. She won't agree but it's more important that she absorb the lesson that she'll lose her invitation if she's disrespectful.", "Surely your mother can cancel her own flight.", " NTA. \n\nShe is. \n\nCancel that shit.", "Time to set some boundaries", "NTA", "Stand up for gf now & let mama know you\u2019re all grown up. Cancel the ticket and go very LC.", "U need a new mom .", ">Today, my mom called to express her concerns about common law marriage in Texas (my gf and I live together) and accused my gf of trying to manipulate me to gain control of my assets.\n\nYour mom should Google before going all obsessive crazy.\n\n\n*There are two ways to establish a common law marriage in Texas. \nThe first avenue is for the couple to sign a \u201cdeclaration of informal marriage\u201d with the county clerk\u2019s office. Once signed, you and your spouse are considered married for legal purposes.*\n\n*The second way, which takes a bit more effort, is to prove three elements, which are outlined in\u00a0Section 2.401 of the Texas Family Code. The parties must:*\n\n*agree to be married*\n\n*live together in Texas as husband and wife*\n\n\n*hold themselves out to the public as husband and wife*\n\nCommon law marriage doesn't happen just because you live together.  Geesh.\n\n\nBtw.. NTA", "I can\u2019t even believe you are asking this. Grow a set and tell your mum she\u2019s being a massive cvnt, cancel her flight and have a good Christmas", "Nta, sounds like 200 well spent", "NTA\n\nYour mom makes me think if you don\u2019t have a will now that you own a house you should seriously consider getting one.  Then leave your assets to whomever you like.  Otherwise believe it would be your parents who inherit. \n\nAs to the common law thing here in Texas, to my knowledge there is more to it than just cohabitating.\n\nI\u2019d tell your mother she can either cancel her ticket or she can find some place else to stay as she won\u2019t be staying at your house.  \n\nYou can go spend some time with her if she comes but not so that it impacts your relationship with your gf.", "NOPE. Your mother is being wholly toxic. Bounce her till she learns respect.", "You! You are a real man, I would be proud to have you as a son. Your GF is lucky to have you.", "Add that your mother will have to stay in a hotel since she doesn't want to be in the house with your gf.", "Replying to top comment to call out that your mom's concerns with common law marriage in Texas are bullshit. There must be evidence that 1) the couple agreed to be married, 2) after the agreement they lived together in Texas as husband and wife, and 3) represented to others that they were married. If you have not done all three of those things, it is an absolute non issue. \n\nCommon law marriage is not the trap everyone thinks it is, unless you're actually doing the things that makes it apply. Simply cohabitating is NOT enough in ANY state in the US.", "Your mom has NO idea what she is talking about.  Common law marriage doesn\u2019t work that way.  It takes years to establish CL marriage, and she is trying to just stir up trouble.  I\u2019d guess her misguided comments stem from her worry about losing her little boy.  But you\u2019re an adult now, and she needs to let you make your own decisions.  \n\nMost importantly, you need to nip this in the bud ASAP, or your mother will drive away any Gf you have (if you don\u2019t stand up to her).  I think it\u2019s worth having a conversation with your mom to allay her fears and give her a sense of reality.  She needs to trust your adult judgment.  And please recognize that your GF is taking the high road by offering to leave to give you time with your mom.  she doesn\u2019t need to do that, but she did.", "I feel like I need you to give me advice daily. Your advice seems great.", "She may have heard about older Texas laws that had a very (VERY) low bar for establishing common law marriage. \n\nIf you \u201cheld yourselves out\u201d as married, and if you cohabited for even one night, you were married. Remember this was a rural state with huge distances, and a circuit preacher might come around only once or twice a year. So either remote communities were going to have a lot of illegitimate children, or there had to be a way for people to establish marriage without an ordained minister and a 100 mile trip to a courthouse. \n\nProblem is, that means if Peggy Sue and Earl went to a motel and signed in as Mr and Mrs and spent the night, they\u2019re now married. It got messy. \n\nAnyway, she may have heard about that and thought you were married under Texas law.", "Your mom is stepping all over some serious boundaries. You aren\u2019t a child she can order around. I think if you let this slide it\u2019s only going to escalate to further problems.\n\nI say NTA, but your mom sure is. I would tell her she needs to rethink her decision if she wants to be a part of you and your girlfriends lives.", "If your girlfriend is paying rent, she is doing a bad job of getting control of your assets.  NTA", "Also. Your mom is going to be like this forever, she\u2019s showing you now. Deal with her (aka cut that shit down now) with the one you love, and put your gf first, or deal with your mom with someone else. It\u2019s a lose/lose with your mom. So make the outcome worth it on your end at least.", "Bro, sometimes family sucks. NTA and sorry my dude.", "You legally cannot kick your girlfriend out like that. She is legally your tenant and has rights. So in addition to just being an asshole, your mom is also suggesting you break the law.", "I\u2019m curious if your mom is usually like this or if someone planted the idea in her head? Who just randomly thinks about common law marriage and instantly assumes you\u2019re being scammed?", "Sounds like mom needs a hotel room and also common law marriage is almost unheard of these days, it\u2019s only legal in a few states and even then in Texas it requires having agreed to be married, living together and represent yourself as married.  She sounds confused and a challenging person.  Stand up for yourself and girlfriend", "Hi there. Firstly: NTA. Secondly: is this sort of behaviour normal for your mom? (think back several years to compare)\n\nBecause if this is outside the range of her usual behaviour, it could be an indicator of neurological problems, like stroke or dementia. Symptoms of dementia include changes in mood and behaviour, processing of decisions, and for people with Lewy body dementia - hallucinations, delusions, and agitation.\n\nBut if this IS normal behaviour for her, then it's not you. It's her. Cancel the ticket. And I understand why you moved to Texas!", "\"Kick Gf out\" is such vile language and if those are the terms she used, then Ugh. Maybe you can use the 200$ to book her in a hotel/airbnb nearby instead so that she can visit you & meet Gf.", "Going against the grain here and say YTA since you intend to cancel the flight and not give your mother\u2019s money back (giving back the Christmas gift doesn\u2019t count). Now you would be absolutely in the right to say she will not be welcome to stay in your house and will need to book a hotel if she does come, but cancelling the flight you have not payed for is a dick move.", "Nope. No privileges for assholes. Mom was too toxic to love.", "It might help to remind her that your gf is important to you and she is not making a very good first impression on gf and her family. It is salvageable though, if she puts you first, since your gf is clearly trying to do by being so accommodating to such unreasonable demands. Gf sounds like a keeper.", "I would also question whether this is normal behaviour for your mum. If it is abnormal than definitely look for something like a reasonable worry that is blown out of proportion by talking to the wrong people or something. If though it's normal behaviour talking to her won't change a thing.", "You could always tell mommy dearest that if she's uncomfortable staying in the house with your GF, she's more than welcome to stay at a hotel or AirBnB", "Yeah. My mom would pull all kinds of crap like this because she had anxiety. She jumped to the most ridiculous \u201csolutions\u201d when she was anxious about a situation. I\u2019m not sure how to navigate your mom, or if it\u2019s worth it. But my mom could usually be talked off a ledge if I asked enough questions to make my preferred option sound like her idea.", "That is really good advice. It would help get to the root cause of the issue - if your mom is willing to help honest and open. Another thing, will you please make sure your words and actions show your GF that she matters? She is your every day. She needs to know that.", "It's brilliant advice !", "Have your mom still come and your gf stay and when she gets there say surprise.", "Aw thanks. \n\nThat\u2019s very nice of you to say.", "Typically common law marriages require you to file taxes together, have a joint bank account, etc, not just live together with one person paying the other rent.  Check the rules for TX, but in my state, roommates don\u2019t typically qualify.", "In Texas it's usually not enough to just live together and be in a relationship. You have to call each other husband and wife, especially to other people, and file your federal taxes jointly and all that sort of thing.\n\nYour mom seems to have really escalated this situation and it's very strange.", ">Anyway, she may have heard about that and thought you were married under Texas law.\n\nIf she believed that, then she's really knowingly asking him to send his *wife* away.", "Except that unless Peggy Sue and Earl decided to tell everyone they were married or otherwise recorded themselves as being married afterwards, there is nothing requiring them to be married.\n\nExcept perhaps the father of Peggy Sue, his friends, and a shotgun to ensure Earl helped raise the baby if Peggy Sue got knocked up that night.  But that has less to do with common law marriage and more to do with shotgun weddings.", "He has the right to keep at least some of the money she paid him if he can't get a full refund.\n\nedited for clarity", "Yep it\u2019s just going to continue and likely get worse overtime unless he comes down on mom like a hammer now and every time she pulls the same stunt again.", "Yeah\u2026sounds like a real gold digger he\u2019s got there. I bet she splits utilities, chips in for groceries, and helps keep his house clean too. He better be careful\u2026 /s", "THIS. \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb", "She's too toxic to be welcome at this point. Mom needs to learn now that she can't bully other adults. And your girlfriend needs to stand her ground against abuse. She must like you a lot though to offer such kindness on your behalf.", "It would also help for u/DonkeyKong1207 to remind his mom that gf pays rent.  GF is a legal tenant and it is absolutely outrageous to ask her to leave her home.", "In the US these laws usually include things like calling each other husband/ wife publicly and even her taking his last name publicly.  It's meant to be very difficult to fall into accidentally. (I don't think this holds true in other countries.)", "In Texas it goes back to when you might not have someone around to officiate the paperwork of a marriage.  You have to publicly present yourselves as married, file taxes, all that jazz, and just never get around to filling out the paperwork for whatever reason.  Very reasonable if a traveling judge only comes through town every six months and often doesn't have enough time to marry everyone and hold all the trials and manage all the land disputes before he leaves.\n\nBut... It's not something you can do accidentally.\n\nA friend's parents have been living together in Texas for 30+ years.  They're still not common law married because they've never decided to be.", "Why? She told him, last minute, to cancel it unless he\u2019s willing to kick his partner out of her home for crazy reasons. Why is it his responsibility to pay for that cancellation?", "How do you figure when his mother paid for the trip? All he did was book it and refund money would go to her not him or should be that way.", "Guess I should have read it more carefully. I thought the cancellation was his idea. Thanks for pointing that out"]}
