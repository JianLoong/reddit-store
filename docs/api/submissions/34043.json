My partner and I have been living with my MIL since the beginning of May. We had fallen on hard times and she agreed to allow us to move in to get back on our feet. \n\nDespite the fact that she has a three bedroom house entirely to herself, she refused to make space for us in the main part of the house. So, we ended up fitting us and some of our things into the back corner of her freezing cold, unfinished basement. We got a storage unit that costs us almost $200 per month for the rest of our stuff because she didn\u2019t want it there - it would have fit in our space, but she didn\u2019t want to look at the clutter when she came down once a week to do laundry. She also wouldn\u2019t allow our cats to come but luckily my friend took them in for the time being and we give her $30 per week for keeping them, plus of course paying for litter/food/care/etc. This was supposed to only be a couple of months. \n\nWhen we moved in, we sat down together and she decided that $250 per month would be our rent, plus $150 toward utilities. We said okay and have been paying that every month. But since then, she has screamed at us weekly and talked crap to everyone who will listen about how we\u2019re taking advantage of her and she\u2019s \u201cproviding for us.\u201d She does not buy us groceries or anything like that, so we were confused and finally asked what we were paying her for then. This was in September. \n\nShe said she has been paying the mortgage and all utilities on her own and has been putting all the money we\u2019ve given her in an envelope as a moving fund. So things came to a head the other day because we are now starting to look for apartments and calculated that we should have about $3000 in that moving fund. We focused on paying down some of our debts so we don\u2019t end up back in this situation again, because we trusted that she was saving this money. Now that we\u2019re asking for it so that we can get moved, she has backtracked and said she\u2019ll help with what she\u2019s able to. After our huge argument about where all of this money is and why she would lie to us about it, she sent my partner and I a group text saying, \u201cThis text serves as your written 30 day notice and you WILL be out of my house by midnight on January 30.\u201d \n\nSo now on top of freaking out about where the hell we\u2019re going to go, we have multiple people in his family calling us ungrateful assholes for \u201ceverything she\u2019s done for us.\u201d I\u2019m just so exhausted by this toxic situation and I have no idea if I\u2019m the asshole for calling her out on it because it seems like I just totally screwed us over. This is also the shortened version of all the smoke and mirrors with money that she\u2019s pulled over this time but this is already a novel.\n\nEditing from a comment another Redditor said gives better context: Yes, we were saving since May. When we sat down for that convo in September, she demanded that I write down all of our debts and the entirety of our financial position, which I felt was fair given that she is helping us and could give advice since she\u2019s done well for herself. She asked us what we had saved for the apartment and that\u2019s how the agreement was come to about the moving fund. She advised us to put the money we had toward to high interest things we were paying down and then we came up with a plan together to tackle the rest of it. I really thought that we were all on the same page because she was being so awesome at that time. The conversation was \u201chey I\u2019ve been putting away this money for you, don\u2019t worry about it, pay this, this and this down.\u201d The only thing that I can think of that changed was she spent time lately with her family that HATES that she\u2019s helping us.", "created_utc": 1703947793, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18uh8of/aita_for_causing_a_huge_fight_with_my_mil/", "score": 199, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

When we sat down for that convo in September, she demanded that I write down all of our debts and the entirety of our financial position, which I felt was fair given that she is helping us and could give advise since she\u2019s done well for herself. She asked us what we had saved for the apartment and that\u2019s how the agreement was come to about the moving fund. She advised us to put the money we had toward to high interest things we were paying down and then we came up with a plan together to tackle the rest of it. I really thought that we were all on the same page because she was being so awesome at that time. The conversation was \u201chey I\u2019ve been putting away this money for you, don\u2019t worry about it, pay this, this and this down.\u201d The only thing that I can think of that changed was she spent time lately with her family that HATES that she\u2019s helping us.", "What kind of contract are you suggesting even exists, out of curiosity?", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

If she re-agrees to give you that money, then do it. But don't rent a crappy rental just to get out if she doesn't give you some of it at least. Stay not paying rent until either you are ready or you get a signed judge's order. Th police wouldn't kick you out or let her lock you out without an order. If they do call the sheriff to make her let you back in and tell the sheriff, you thought the police would know the law as well as a sheriff would. You are going to need utility deposits besides rent and deposit. keep not paying and make her go to the court to get an eviction order if she wants to spend the money and be that petty.
