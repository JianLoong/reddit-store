{"id": 34043, "submission_id": "18uh8of", "title": "AITA for causing a huge fight with my MIL?", "selftext": "So this is a complex situation and I will do my best to keep it short. My partner and I have been living with my MIL since the beginning of May. We had fallen on hard times and she agreed to allow us to move in to get back on our feet. \n\nDespite the fact that she has a three bedroom house entirely to herself, she refused to make space for us in the main part of the house. So, we ended up fitting us and some of our things into the back corner of her freezing cold, unfinished basement. We got a storage unit that costs us almost $200 per month for the rest of our stuff because she didn\u2019t want it there - it would have fit in our space, but she didn\u2019t want to look at the clutter when she came down once a week to do laundry. She also wouldn\u2019t allow our cats to come but luckily my friend took them in for the time being and we give her $30 per week for keeping them, plus of course paying for litter/food/care/etc. This was supposed to only be a couple of months. \n\nWhen we moved in, we sat down together and she decided that $250 per month would be our rent, plus $150 toward utilities. We said okay and have been paying that every month. But since then, she has screamed at us weekly and talked crap to everyone who will listen about how we\u2019re taking advantage of her and she\u2019s \u201cproviding for us.\u201d She does not buy us groceries or anything like that, so we were confused and finally asked what we were paying her for then. This was in September. \n\nShe said she has been paying the mortgage and all utilities on her own and has been putting all the money we\u2019ve given her in an envelope as a moving fund. So things came to a head the other day because we are now starting to look for apartments and calculated that we should have about $3000 in that moving fund. We focused on paying down some of our debts so we don\u2019t end up back in this situation again, because we trusted that she was saving this money. Now that we\u2019re asking for it so that we can get moved, she has backtracked and said she\u2019ll help with what she\u2019s able to. After our huge argument about where all of this money is and why she would lie to us about it, she sent my partner and I a group text saying, \u201cThis text serves as your written 30 day notice and you WILL be out of my house by midnight on January 30.\u201d \n\nSo now on top of freaking out about where the hell we\u2019re going to go, we have multiple people in his family calling us ungrateful assholes for \u201ceverything she\u2019s done for us.\u201d I\u2019m just so exhausted by this toxic situation and I have no idea if I\u2019m the asshole for calling her out on it because it seems like I just totally screwed us over. This is also the shortened version of all the smoke and mirrors with money that she\u2019s pulled over this time but this is already a novel.\n\nEditing from a comment another Redditor said gives better context: Yes, we were saving since May. When we sat down for that convo in September, she demanded that I write down all of our debts and the entirety of our financial position, which I felt was fair given that she is helping us and could give advice since she\u2019s done well for herself. She asked us what we had saved for the apartment and that\u2019s how the agreement was come to about the moving fund. She advised us to put the money we had toward to high interest things we were paying down and then we came up with a plan together to tackle the rest of it. I really thought that we were all on the same page because she was being so awesome at that time. The conversation was \u201chey I\u2019ve been putting away this money for you, don\u2019t worry about it, pay this, this and this down.\u201d The only thing that I can think of that changed was she spent time lately with her family that HATES that she\u2019s helping us.", "created_utc": 1703947793, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18uh8of/aita_for_causing_a_huge_fight_with_my_mil/", "score": 80, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

When we sat down for that convo in September, she demanded that I write down all of our debts and the entirety of our financial position, which I felt was fair given that she is helping us and could give advise since she\u2019s done well for herself. She asked us what we had saved for the apartment and that\u2019s how the agreement was come to about the moving fund. She advised us to put the money we had toward to high interest things we were paying down and then we came up with a plan together to tackle the rest of it. I really thought that we were all on the same page because she was being so awesome at that time. The conversation was \u201chey I\u2019ve been putting away this money for you, don\u2019t worry about it, pay this, this and this down.\u201d The only thing that I can think of that changed was she spent time lately with her family that HATES that she\u2019s helping us.", "What kind of contract are you suggesting even exists, out of curiosity?", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

However, they listened to her leaving them with no money and now she's wanting them to move out and she's not giving them the money. This was her Idea. She told them to do this.", "They had it put back on top of what they have MIL and she told them to put it towards debt so that's what they did.", "The point there was - she\u2019s not paying for groceries, what does she mean she\u2019s providing for us? Not that we ever expected that at all", "That\u2019s not at all what I meant. I meant that that was the only thing I could think of her meaning by her \u201cproviding for us\u201d at the time because we were paying as agreed. And given that we were providing everything for ourselves and paying rent, we didn\u2019t know why she was saying she was \u201cproviding for us.\u201d", "I think you've been treated really badly by your MIL, and I wish there was a good way to fix it.", "You need to edit into the main post this whole bit about the Sept conversation where you had savings and she told you to put it in debt and aired you she would give you the rent etc. Without the clarity that you were only following her guidance because she decided she was in charge you sound ungrateful. This makes it clear that she\u2019s a bigger part of the issue.", "I don\u2019t think you\u2019re gonna get any kind of response that you will find helpful. It\u2019s tough when y\u2019all put a plan together, is it too late to ask her what has upset her. Frame it as you were wrong and apologize, right or wrong it might be best option.", "Don't worry, that point was clear in your post to anyone not purposely misunderstanding it.", "I\u2019m realizing this with the responses this far. I genuinely am grateful for the fact that she\u2019s allowed us to be here and it was a weight off my shoulders when we put that plan in action in September.", "Of course it would be. And if you\u2019d been my kid I\u2019d have made the exact same arrangement and advice- I just would have also followed through.", "Bottom line is this woman can\u2019t / shouldn\u2019t be trusted further.  I understand that you don\u2019t have other options you can think of, but this person has been toxic and insane from the get go. This isn\u2019t a safe space.", "You\u2019ve been paying 1000 (btwn rent/utilities/storage) and paying down some debt at the same time. Sell your storage and find a room you can rent somewhere until you can figure out a new plan that doesn\u2019t involve a saboteur."]}
