For the most part, we get along fairly well. There\u2019s one thing she does that didn\u2019t bother me for a while but has become so frequent that now it is. Essentially, anytime I tell her things I like (ex. sunflowers) or dislike (ex. tomatoes or bone-in wings) and it doesn\u2019t align with her likes and dislikes, she says some variation of \u201cthat\u2019s so white of you\u201d or \u201call white girls like that.\u201d I truly didn\u2019t care the first several times, I don\u2019t think an occasional laugh about a white stereotype I fit into is that bad or anything. I can laugh at myself. I just feel like with the frequency we\u2019re at now, she\u2019s basically trying to tell me I\u2019m the most generic stereotypical person out there. And if I am, okay, but I don\u2019t feel like it needs to be pointed out anytime I try to share about myself.\nThis was a very difficult conversation to have with her because I do very much know this is child\u2019s play compared to what non-white people go through on a day-to-day basis. I very specifically said I was not trying to say she\u2019s a racist person, but for something that would be completely unacceptable to say to non-white people, I think she might be too comfortable saying it this often to me. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that funny anymore and would like if she found something else to make fun of sometimes.\n\nHer response was that she feels like \u201cwhite people aren\u2019t oppressed, so fuck \u2018em,\u201d and that I\u2019m extremely soft. I still don\u2019t know how to feel about that. White people are not oppressed, that is absolutely true, and I am soft, but when we\u2019re supposed to be good friends, that seemed a bit harsh to me. She did also clarify that these \u201croasts\u201d (her term of choice) are not to be funny. Which I asked \u201cso they\u2019re just to be mean?\u201d And she said \u201cyeah.\u201d That bothered me more.\nMy whole M.O. is be kind to people, live and let live kind of thing. I\u2019m disabled and don\u2019t have the spoons to be nasty to people for the thrill of it. I don\u2019t generally keep myself around people who are deliberately nasty to others - be that racism or transphobia or even tipping $0 on a large restaurant bill or whatever. This was the first time I realized she just meant it to be hurtful because I\u2019m white and therefore deserve it.\nAgain, I absolutely understand non-white people have wayyy bigger issues than this and I\u2019m not trying to say I\u2019m a victim or anything.
