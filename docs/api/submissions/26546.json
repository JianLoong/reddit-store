When we met he was a single father who had sole custody of two kids. The mother hadn\u2019t been in the picture in years, big time drug user and lost all her kids. I was a single mother with three kids. One of the things (There were many things but this really got me as my kids are the most import thing in my life) that I found appealing was that he was legally raising and loving another man\u2019s child as his own! The first few years together were great, some minor disagreements with parenting, like him calling my 3 and 4yr olds sissies because they needed a night light to sleep. \n\nBlending families always has learning curves I thought, best to discuss with him and we can iron out a mutual parenting plan. It seemed to work for a few years.\n\nWe had all been living as one family for about five years. He proposed, 3 months after our wedding things started to change. Little things at first, comments that weren\u2019t mean just mostly sarcastic Then it turned into yelling if a chore wasn\u2019t done to his exact standards.\n\nEach kid had 1 chore a day. I was not okay with this yelling and bickering that occurred daily, once again we talked but he wasn\u2019t receptive and got very defensive  \u201cYou let the kids get away with everything and they have no consequences.\u201d I\u2019m a firm believer in not double punishing kids. So if a chore wasn\u2019t done correctly I would tell to remember next time that this is also part of your chore. For example if one was taking the trash out but didn\u2019t put a new trash bag in the trash can, it\u2019s not defiance it\u2019s a typical kid\u2019s forgetfulness. To clarify all five of the kids had this issue. \n\nHe started harping on the kids more and his kids point blank refused to do their chore. This went on for 2weeks, he didn\u2019t say anything. So I brought it up and his response blew me away. He said \u201cYour kids can do my kid\u2019s chores for awhile seeing as how yours don\u2019t know how to do chores correctly and mykids need a break\u201d  \n\nAfter that, It was he was yelling at my three for everything and it said it my kid\u2019s fault that his didn\u2019t do their chores. We both worked 40 hours a week, I handled the bulk of the household chores with the kids having small tasks like trash, putting the dishes away, folding clothes, sweeping, feeding the dogs and I rotated the chores every week so each kid didn\u2019t get stuck with the same chore. \n\nTired of only me and my kids cleaning up the house we all lived in, I decided to give those that did their chores a reward of extra screen time. His kids-still not doing chores- complained about not getting the extra screen time. He bought his kids each a tablet after denying my kid a tablet for her 12th bday. I put parenting software on the tablets and only allowed them time if their chores were done. He said I was an asshole and I had no right to stop them using what he bought them.
