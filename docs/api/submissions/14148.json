This isn't her going out of her way to prove him wrong.", "Why would it be less funny if it's fake?", "I personally only find funny videos funny if they are real. They are no longer funny if they are scripted.", "There's a fine line between \"that's not possible\" and genuine plotholes at times.", "Laughing at stupid shit that goes viral is just laughing at stupid shit. Something that may influence your worldview is different, but that\u2019s not close to what this post describes. I don\u2019t see the problem with what the guy is doing. I\u2019d say NAH I guess bc the guy really isn\u2019t doing anything wrong", "The thing is the videos mentioned seem to be low stakes, but yeah I still agree just like with what OP said. \n\nThe thing that gets me is how much this matters to BF. It's not that he's surprised he literally 'really hopes it isn't' fake... \n\nMaybe I am wrong but this whole situation should be: \n\nBF: look funny video\n\nOP: haha, bet its fake\n\nBF: haha yeah probably *or* Huh maybe hadn't thought of that. \n\nThe end. They move on. \n\nBF is sad he lost his blissful ignorance.", ">People seem to be missing the fact that OP isn't going out their way to rain on BF's parade\n\nAre you sure about that?\n\n>I was curious so went on the web and found out it was actually an ad for an adult website.

I'm in the gaming community, and most of the people are playing characters or making senerios up/staging them for their audience.\n\nAutistic or not, like other commenters mentioned, she is sucking the fun out of things that are meant to be just fun.", "Don't tell her about pro wrestling.", "Exactly! Why do some people think it needs to be real to be funny? Her boyfriend is trying to share a little bit of joy with her and she has to kill it.", "She sounds insufferable", "What about comedians? You're telling me they don't have a life full of hilarious moments?", "Based on what she said, she never told him that she doesn't like those videos. She only told him the one he sent her was fake. If she hasn't specifically told him that she doesn't like that then no, the fault isn't with him.", "I'm autistic and I feel the same way (tho I wouldn't be that quick to armchair diagnose someone). I just hate feeling like I'm being lied to. If the media is upfront about it being fiction, sure that's fine. But trying to pass off staged videos like they're real just really pisses me off.", "I'm autistic and I definitely get annoyed by false information being presented as true. A lie is a lie, regardless of how it's presented.\n\nI don't care about being right or wrong either, I just don't want people to believe misinformation. That's why I correct things like that too. And I admit it confuses me if someone gets upset by that. It's like, don't you **want** the correct info? Why do you want to believe the lie?\n\nI certainly want people to correct me when I present a bit of misinformation. I'd rather be corrected than continue to believe something that isn't true. Much better than living in ignorance.", "Fake information on a funny video? She herself admitted it isn\u2019t a video of substance, entire point is to make people laugh.", "That\u2019s a bold assumption. I see what ur saying but there are some people (myself included) that are bothered by people watching something they think is real when it\u2019s fake. We might be the minority but please don\u2019t go around diagnosing someone with autism because you think their behavior isn\u2019t socially acceptable", "Autistic person here. I'd say... yeah, maybe. Still TA, tho. If there was any substance to the video, I'd get the importance of knowing whether something is true/genuine or not. But it's just funny stuff. Or heartwarming stuff. Sometimes make-believe is nice and harmless", "Exactly!", "did she though? she never mentions actually *telling* him that she dislikes staged funny videos.", "This is my thought too. It's fine if the bf wants to laugh at the videos but OP has clearly made a point numerous times that she personally, does not find the humor in it. You can't fault OP for pointing out the invalidity of the videos any more than BF more or less ruining his OWN joy by constantly trying to get her to sign off on them lol", "You know how to solve that?

No one should care that much.", "OP, if this is the biggest thing you have to complain about right now, I\u2019d say things are pretty good. Your bf is just sending you videos he finds funny: fake or not. He wants to share them with you, and that\u2019s a GOOD thing. You don\u2019t have to like them, but do you have to shut him down so hard about them?Do you really need to be right so badly that you complain to this extent? If so, maybe talk to someone about it.

And it's definitely made me inadvertently TA before. I assume people want to not be wrong when they say things just like I would. Let's just say that most of my friends are similarly neurodivergent or have close experience with people who are.\n\nI also think that the faked \"funny\" videos are deceptive in a way that I think is unhealthy. Like a content generation mill. It feels like someone analyzed market trends and made the video carefully following them to cash in on some type of profit, something I think is morally shady.", "I think for most people when it comes to funny videos, it just doesn't matter if it's real or staged. People just want to laugh. It's fine if that bothers you and you want people to tell you. But you can't expect everyone to feel the same way you do about it. You might not understand why they don't care to know if a funny video is staged, but that's not really up to you to decide if it should matter to them or not.\n\nAs long as it's just a funny video there's really no harm in just laughing at it. Like the OP said, political stuff or scientific info is important to know true from a lie. But for a video that's just meant to make people laugh...no big deal because it's not hurting anyone. Again, if that bothers you it's fine. But not everyone is that way.\n\nI think most people know that most funny videos are fake. But they don't care because it makes them laugh, which is the only point of those types of videos.", "So?  There's a difference between laughing at a comedy script and laughing at a real life accident.  Both can be funny, but only one is true.  It might seem trivial to you, but if you're autistic (or several other conditions, or just some personality types) the difference _matters_.  False information isn't funny, just infuriating and confusing.\n\nThe world is complicated enough without mislabeling staged jokes as true events. Can't they just be funny?  Why do they have to be misleading as well?\n\nI have a friend who can't use the internet at all on April 1 for this exact reason.  They don't mind the obvious and funny jokes, but things that try to seem real and aren't are actively painful to them, which makes the entire day a huge drain of energy and resources.", "Different scenario. If a video tries to come off as genuine, but is scripted, it's no longer funny. If a video is meant to be scripted, it can still be funny.", "There's a difference between the kind of joke in those.  \"Funny\" videos are usually slapstick - accidents or cute pets.  Comedy TV, the good kind anyway, is telling deeper character jokes, which can be funny whether they're scripted or not.", "Lady spilling paint all over herself doesn\u2019t have an agenda if you don\u2019t look for one. And for the battery stuff or the tide pod stuff. Those people were already stupid. The video didn\u2019t make them stupid, just gave them something stupid to do, which would have happened eventually, because again, they were already stupid.", "It\u2019s real to me dammit!", "As someone on the spectrum, I totally agree. I love laughing at things but part of my enjoyment comes from knowing context especially here someone may be harmed (even slightly) \n\nIf a video of someone falling off a ladder is scripted, I can find it funny. If the video is candid, I will more likely be horrified or not find it funny at all. That's just how my brain works.\n\nHOWEVER, I have also learned not everyone else cares, so I have stopped calling out fakes unless the information is fake and causing harm.  Otherwise I keep my fact checking to myself.", "As someone on the spectrum, April 1st is the bane of my existence. I don't avoid the internet entirely, but I do strictly limit which sites I visit on that day.", "Do you speak for all autistic people? Because I disagree with you - we know the boyfriend doesn't care if it's fake or not and just want to have a laugh. If this is such an issue for OP then she should ask her bf to stop sending her videos. Just because OP thinks about these thing deeper doesn't mean the boyfriend has to do the same.", "I speak for me.  What else were you expecting?  Are you seriously expecting people to come to this sub in order to... not share or mention their perspective or how they would feel?\n\nWhat did you think AITA is for, some kind of obscure religious ritual?\n\nYou are of course correct, the real issue here is that OP and bf should just communicate like adults and agree to not bother each other with these videos.  NAH, just two people bickering over trivia.", "The way you wrote it came across as if you wrote it for everyone who is autistic. This is why I made my comment. Obviously people will share their perspective here."]}
