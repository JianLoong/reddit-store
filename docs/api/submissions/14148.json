You CAN go into every post and say \"This is fake\" which everyone already knows, or you can treat the post like a \"what would you do IF...\" question.\n\nbasically, you can just enjoy a funny video at face value, or you can dissect it and suck all the fun out of it.\n\nalso, this incident obviously never happened and your post is fake.\n\nYTA", "I think this is a pretty low stakes issue, but YWBTA if you continued to tell him all these videos are fake. I know that nerf/paint video you're talking about, and I also have my suspicions that it's fake. And I also hate these staged prank videos just to get views. But there is no harm in your BF getting some enjoyment out of them. Life is already a shit show, we don't need to deprive him of the little pieces of joy. Just chuckle and move on as best you can lol", "\"It\u2019s fine for funny content but where it does matter is for political or \u2018scientific\u2019 content.\"\n\nIn your own words you should have no issue with a silly video that's staged. YTA. Sometimes people just want to laugh", "Some people come to aita believing everything they read here to be fake. And a lot of it probably is. But who cares? It's more fun to let yourself believe it's all real. Practice some suspension of disbelief, it makes life a lot more enjoyable. Yta", "YTA. \n\nYou already had an argument about this exact thing, why are you about to do it again?  Your boyfriend likes to laugh at funny videos regardless if they're real or not. You're valuing being right over being kind. Let it go.", "YTA: It doesn't matter if it's fake. He thinks it's funny. Why take that away from him?", "YTA if he doesn't care if they're real or fake, he's just getting a laugh out of it.\n\nNTA if he believes these are real videos and makes real commentary on what he believes to be real.  \n\nThis is comparable to the people when watching a movie go \"That's not possible\". The \"reality police\" can really ruin the enjoyment of a fun movie.", "YTA. \n\nIf you don't find those things funny, fine, but don't be a buzzkill. Just fake a laugh and move on.

There\u2019s no harm in not wondering if that fail video is real, but he should definitely have some interest in fact checking other things he finds online. It\u2019s so easy to fake videos and photos or show things out of context. We should all be in the habit of questioning sources and thinking about the context of what we see and the potential agenda of the person sharing it. NTA", "NTA.

Being right over something SO minuscule is not worth another fight, or another dig at your husband.", "Lol yeah, YTA. They\u2019re just meant to be funny little videos. No one cares if they\u2019re actually real or not. Learn how to laugh.", "YTA. Sure. It might not be real, but he still finds it funny.  No reason to rain on his parade if its not harming anyone. Just say you don't like them as much as he does. Different stroke for different folks and all that", "Yeah, I'm thinking that YWBTA here.\n\nSo what if it's fake, along with a bunch of other content on the web?  It makes him laugh.  I'd rather look at stuff that makes me laugh, no matter what it is.  It's great escapism.", "YWBTA if you keep determining if every silly video he sends you is fake or not and then telling him. If he finds them funny, just let it go, scripted or not. It's something that makes him smile which is good.", "YTA.

Fake or not, find your sense of humour.", "Seems to me he just has a simple sense of humor and likes to laugh and enjoy it.

Fake or not, he\u2019s just having a good time and trying to share with you something that made him laugh", "YTA, I feel like you would also not be a lot of fun at parties, comedy shows, or anywhere else really.

Pretty sure in the back of his mind he already knows that and doesnt need you to shut down his fun.  I'd be asking myself WHY you have to tell him? Doesn't matter what other people think is real, you need to give your bf credit and know he also knows they are staged.  Are you feeling like you're smarter? Coz thats how its coming off.  Yes, shut it and just tell him it wasn't amusing for you.", ">Am I the asshole for telling him it\u2019s fake and ruining it?

Let the guy enjoy funny stuff. All comedy movies are staged. Why does this make a difference? Please stop being a fun sucker", "YTA\n\nYour just trying to ruin things that don't matter.

That shows a pettiness in your character that you should address. The same if you tell him this other video is fake. \n\nWith that being said, you should POLITELY tell him that you don\u2019t really enjoy these videos and ask him to stop sending them.\n\nEdit: definitely do not pretend to laugh or play along. That is only go to encourage more videos; and I think we both know how that\u2019s going to end.  \n\nCommunication is always important.", "NTA - how old is your bf? Why is he so gullible?
