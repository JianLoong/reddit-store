She died when I was 12. I still wear them to this day.\n\nSo I (30F) have cancer. It's one of the most survivable ones so I'm trying not to be too worried. To be on the safe side though, I decided I would update my will just in case something were to happen. I left the house to my husband (30M) and divided my money three ways to go to him, my daughter (5F), and my sister (29F).However, when my sister found my will she was livid. That was because I had said that if I were to die I would like to be buried with my earrings as they are very special to me. My sister said that she should get the earrings after I die to be close to me.\n\nI don't want to give it to her though. It was given to me as a gift and holds sentimental value. I even got my ears pierced again so that I wouldn't have to swap out the earrings. I told her that it was mine and she wouldn't get it to which she ran to our mom.\n\nMy mom is telling me to give it to her while I'm still alive since my sister is already scared for me and doesn't need this stress. I don't want to but am wondering if I'm the ah if I told her no.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit to clear some stuff up:\n\n1. The earrings are not heirlooms. They were a gift made solely for me.\n2. My sister did not like my grandmother. She even refused a necklace our grandma got her because she thought it was too \"ugly\"\n3. My daughter has many other earrings, necklaces, rings, and other jewelry I'm getting for her.\n4. I'm thinking about finishing the other half-finished set and giving it to my daughter but it's really expensive so I'm not sure\n5. I have thyroid cancer but luckily it was caught early and I am undergoing treatment so please don't worry!\n\nEdit #2:\n\n1. My sister went snooping and found my will in my office. I was leaving her only 20,000 if I were to die\n2. My daughter has way more money than my sister. She'll get 1.3 million dollars after my death. I made it so that she wouldn't get the money too young and live a normal life.\n3. My husband has a very good job and makes 200,000 a year so I'm not worried he won't be able to manage.\n4. I am seriously considering removing my sister completely after her bullshit.\n5. I don't talk to my daughter much about my cancer because I don't want her to think of me as sick so we try to fill up her life with happy memories.\n6. Again, my earrings are not heirlooms. They were made for me and me alone.\n7. The house IS going to my daughter. If me and my husband were to die, she'll be inheriting the house as soon as she turns 21.

You might consider leaving them to your daughter, for whom they might mean as much as they've meant to you.\n\nIn addition to your will, I highly recommend that you update your Living Will, Health Care Power if Attorney, and Durable Power of Attorney.  If your health worsened and you needed someone else to make decisions on your behalf, you might not want your mother or sister to have any room to argue that they should make the decisions for your care.\n\nSimilarly, if your health worsens, consider pre-planning your own funeral arrangements.

Your suggestion that I give away earrings that daily bring me comfort to placate her is outrageous: it would have been insulting enough if you had suggested that I give them to her in my will, but it is utterly unconscionable for you to suggest that I give away things that are meaningful to me while I am still alive. You think Sister doesn't need the stress? I'm literally going through cancer treatment and planning for what will happen if I die, and you care more about Sister's stress than mine? I have dozens of people online telling me that I should cut Sister completely out of my will for this... And maybe I should.

People have requests or plans for their own funerals all of the time. Some want to be cremated, some want a casket, etc. Some people want to be buried with their favorite items as well. Some people plan their whole damn funeral, for goodness sake. The whole \"you won't know because you're dead\" is true (only if that's you're belief) but people do things for those who are deceased all of the time. Like leaving flowers by gravestones or leaving gifts there etc. People who have passed on can't smell or see those flowers or hear when you talk to them. But we still do it. If I was your sister and you left them to me after this I would not even be able to wear them if I knew it was not what you wanted. \n\nIn the end, you do what you want.

Treatment made me think I was going to die that time! But right at 6 years later I\u2019m still cancer free and living life. NTA OP, but sorry your sister is.

The degree to which she should NOT have to give a fuck about the opinions of others is incredibly high. OP, NTA. Cut your sister out, though.

You know that if you die, your mom and sister are going to try to find those earrings and will ransack your house looking for them. If you truly wish to be buried in them, have your daughter arrange with the funeral home to put them on at the last minute (in my culture there is a viewing of the body before the funeral and a last viewing before the person is buried on the next day). Your daughter can arrange to have a private viewing before you are buried so that she can say goodbye and put the earrings on you.", "NTA - they are your things, you can do what you want.

One of the things our close-knit friend group (we were/are all like brothers) liked to do together is smoke cigars. We all had good-sized humidors but his dwarfed the rest of ours.

Do what you want, AH or not.", "NTA\n\nThe earrings are very special to you...I would think you would want them to go to your daughter, so she can wear them and think of you.  Both my sister and I have pieces of jewelry that our mother wore constantly and we both are so grateful to wear something that had such meaning to our mom, I think of her often and feel so close to her, as I see the jewelry on me whenever I look into a mirror.  I cannot tell you how comforting it is to me.  My mom has been gone for nearly 16 years now and I just feel closer to her getting to wear her jewelry.  I know my sister feels the same way.\n\nI am not leaving my siblings anything.  They can provide for themselves.  Everything goes to my husband and then his kids.", "You only put siblings in the will if they were financially dependent on you in life.

She's grieving, but doing it in a way that is taking an emotional toll on you.  I'd still leave the house to your daughter unless you have a solid succession plan in an irrevocable Trust.  If you die & the house goes solely to your husband, he can give/leave it to anyone he chooses.  $1.3M may sound like a lot.  It really isn't.  Unless you live somewhere that offers free higher education, she'll be lucky if that pays for an undergraduate degree in 13 years.  Having that $ will hinder her from qualifying for any type of aide/grants.  (Put all your assets in a trust w/ daughter as beneficiary, minus burial costs.)\n\nThey are YOUR earrings & you can do anything you want with them.  Take them with you.  Leave them to family.

I lost my mother to cancer (as an adult) and I got two small pieces of jewellery that were her everyday jewellery and that meant a lot to her because she got them from someone she loved.

Full stop. If she wanted to huck them in the garbage tomorrow, they're her earrings. It's so much worse that her mom and sister are using her cancer scare to behave like vultures about her belongings - including sister snooping in her things! Her reaction makes it pretty clear the will is exactly what she was looking for, and the earrings why. I had a cancer scare and all my siblings and parents did was make sure I had all the support and help I needed with appointments, surgeries, etc. Frankly if this was my sister I wouldn't take her out of the will. I'd go out and find the ugliest, cheapest earrings possible, wear them once to a family function so that sis and the rest of the family could see them, then I'd will those earrings to her (being very specific as to description so there's no chance of confusing them with any others!) \"so she can feel close to me after my death\".

Your death is not going to change her day to day life.\n\nThis sounds incredibly out-of-touch to me. The average adult in the U.S. has only $1000 in their bank account. I don't know the sister's financial status of course, but it might be significantly less than this woman with cancer, who is apparently relatively wealthy (given her age and the amount she'd be giving to her daughter). \n\nI was 28 when my grandma died, and even the $15,000 I got from her made a huge difference to my life, ability to go to grad school, etc.", "Uh no, her estate should go to her HUSBAND who is her life partner and presumably has put equal amounts of time, energy, and money into their SHARED estate.", ">I would strongly suggest leaving a token amount, say $200. NAL but as I understand it makes it more difficult for the will to be contested.\n\nIAAL. OP is married, has a child, and has at least one living parent. Sister is so far down the line of inheritance that she has no natural right in any jurisdiction I have ever heard of to inherit other than what OP gives her in her Will. And if OP changes her Will, it makes no difference whether she is left $200 or specifically nothing, because her only basis for contesting would be that OP wasn't in her right mind when she changed it and they should go back to the old Will, which claim doesn't depend on what amount she's left in the current one.", "Totally unrelated but really happy to know I'm not the only one that goes through this exact cookie negotiation.", "I think you are underestimating the cost of an education. I have a daughter at a state school. The tuition is reasonable but the housing is like $2250 per month. I just signed an early decision contract for my younger daughter and that school is $84,000 per year. Those costs will only go up by the time this 5 year old graduates.\n\nThe husband will also have the responsibility of medical bills and funeral expenses. He might have to take off an extended period of time to grieve and be there for the 5 year old. He might be a high earner today but we know anything can change in a second. He still has the responsibility of supporting her child to adulthood. His life and the child\u2019s life are going to completely change. It is just free money for the greedy sister. Plus, these are marital funds we are talking about here.", "Nasty and evil? It is true right?", ">Family members (especially siblings or people directly related to the decedent) have not just a chance, but a pretty good one of contesting a will if they are omitted.\n\nErm, no, not as a general rule, unless you're the kids/spouse - especially not the general rule for siblings. The general order of inheritance is kids/spouse. Then parents. THEN siblings. Siblings really have no natural standing to contest if anyone else that comes before them in that list is still alive.", "They do. That is absolutely the better way to do it. If you leave someone a token amount, then they're an heir with standing to be around for the entire estate administration.", "I had anxiety too ( Also I felt incredibly better after the surgery).\nSomebody here said that even if you have high chances, it\u2019s the kind of experience that makes you feel closer to your mortality and they are effin right.\n\nWish your husband a good recovery!", "What the ef did boss had for breakfast?

Best of luck with the recovery!", "NTA.  WTH?  It's ridiculous that your sister--a 29 year-old--went running to Mommy because she didn't get her own way.

And guess what? People steal jewelry from deceased family members, OFF THEIR BODIES, at the funeral because \u201cit will go to waste.\u201d \n\nThis happened at my grandpa\u2019s funeral. Some years ago he bought one of Elvis\u2019 rings at an auction, and when he passed, my mom\u2019s cousins popped out of the woodwork to get it, but the family said no. So AT THE FUNERAL one of the (better) cousins let my mom know SOMEONE HAD STOLEN THE RING OFF HIS BODY. \n\nI\u2019m very glad to hear you\u2019re doing well, but a(n updated) will is something everyone should have because unexpected things can happen to everyone.\n\nEdit: NTA. I\u2019m personally not a jewelry person, and while I do think in a VERY ABSTRACT way that it\u2019s sad that probably some incredible, artistic jewelry has been lost to time because it was buried with someone, but I will always 100% be on the side of the deceased.", "When my grandpa passed they put lottery tickets in his pocket because he always bought tickets and his car was full of non-winning tickets.

Although your earrings are really important to you, I would still consider leaving them to your daughter- in the care of your husband. If you are buried with them, they will rust/tarnish in the ground. Instead you could write a letter or video to your daughter about why you loved the earnings, the relationship with your grandmother and know that they'll be worn and enjoyed for years to come. It's personal though, do what's right for you. I plan to not be burried with anything. I lost my mom young and have all of her jewellery, including her ring I wear every day but I plan to leave it to my kids. \nI would reconsider leaving something to your sister though. Sure, she doesn't need the stress,   But you didn't need cancer. This year my friend and grandma both had cancer, was it stress I didn't need? Yes. Did the fact I love them overweigh the stress? Absolutely. I was stressed for them. My friend and I had actually only known each other 6 months when she got diagnosed, she is new to the area and didn't know many people, so I made sure she never had to go through anything alone, and made sure she never saw how stressed I was for her (but still felt cared for). Dealing with cancer was enough, she didn't need extra worry. \nYour sister is being selfish.", "There is no \"waste.\"  If that rationale is applied, why bother to have a casket or a memorial, or have that family member or friend dressed up in something nice?", "Yeah if it was like, leave your kid in poverty while being buried in a diamond tiara, that's one thing. But that's not the situation.... Daughter is getting 1.3 mil.

Sis is certainly acting like it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDefinitely NTA - In this case, do everything you can to \"take it with you\"!", "If you think your sister is DYING and your first concern that you cry about is getting her material goods, when she\u2019s already leaving you $20k, AND you snooped through her personal stuff to find the will?

What the fuck would you call yourself?", ">where I live it's fairly common to see families fighting against an estranged Aunt/Uncle for \"their piece of the estate.\" Most of the time, they end up winning if they can show that they were not mentioned in the will and that they should have been.\n\nAnd do these estranged Aunts and Uncles have children?
