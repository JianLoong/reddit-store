To be on the safe side though, I decided I would update my will just in case something were to happen. I left the house to my husband (30M) and divided my money three ways to go to him, my daughter (5F), and my sister (29F).However, when my sister found my will she was livid. That was because I had said that if I were to die I would like to be buried with my earrings as they are very special to me. My sister said that she should get the earrings after I die to be close to me.\n\nI don't want to give it to her though. It was given to me as a gift and holds sentimental value. I even got my ears pierced again so that I wouldn't have to swap out the earrings. I told her that it was mine and she wouldn't get it to which she ran to our mom.\n\nMy mom is telling me to give it to her while I'm still alive since my sister is already scared for me and doesn't need this stress.

You might consider leaving them to your daughter, for whom they might mean as much as they've meant to you.\n\nIn addition to your will, I highly recommend that you update your Living Will, Health Care Power if Attorney, and Durable Power of Attorney.  If your health worsened and you needed someone else to make decisions on your behalf, you might not want your mother or sister to have any room to argue that they should make the decisions for your care.\n\nSimilarly, if your health worsens, consider pre-planning your own funeral arrangements.

Your suggestion that I give away earrings that daily bring me comfort to placate her is outrageous: it would have been insulting enough if you had suggested that I give them to her in my will, but it is utterly unconscionable for you to suggest that I give away things that are meaningful to me while I am still alive. You think Sister doesn't need the stress? I'm literally going through cancer treatment and planning for what will happen if I die, and you care more about Sister's stress than mine? I have dozens of people online telling me that I should cut Sister completely out of my will for this... And maybe I should. She snooped, and instead of being touched that I included her in my will, she immediately complained that she wasn't being given enough. I'll be honest, right now it doesn't seem like either of you care about me or my feelings that much.\"\n\nNTA. While I don't fully understand the sentiment of being buried with something (my religion discourages such things), it's clear that it's meaningful *to you*.

People have requests or plans for their own funerals all of the time. Some want to be cremated, some want a casket, etc. Some people want to be buried with their favorite items as well. Some people plan their whole damn funeral, for goodness sake. The whole \"you won't know because you're dead\" is true (only if that's you're belief) but people do things for those who are deceased all of the time. Like leaving flowers by gravestones or leaving gifts there etc. People who have passed on can't smell or see those flowers or hear when you talk to them. But we still do it. If I was your sister and you left them to me after this I would not even be able to wear them if I knew it was not what you wanted. \n\nIn the end, you do what you want. If you leave them behind then leave them with someone who know will treasure them as much as you have. If you want to toss them in the ocean like Rose from Titanic, go for it! They are yours.

How dare she go pawing through your papers?  Not only do I think you should change your will and take her right out, but she should also be banned from your house forever.", "And weird info! My grandmother died at 95. She had a doll, Patsy, that no one wanted, but we all knew it would be weird to throw her away. We buried Patsy with her. Who knows what the archaeologists of the future will think xD", "If the Egyptians are anything to compare, probably good ol Patsy will turn into an avatar of a servant catering to your grandma in the afterlife. \ud83d\ude02", ">Even of Op was most likely to die and was considering passing on the earings, why does the sister think she should be first on the list? She wasn't close with the grandmother and Op has a daughter who she could want to pass them onto. The daughter is 5 but that doesn't mean she couldn;t leave them with the husband for safekeeping until a certain age.", "I agree it's not. But the whole point was that even if it was her sister wouldn't get it.  She can do what she wants  with it\n But if she were to leave it to anyone you should be her daughter.", "If you cared about my daughter you would know that I'm giving her so many other jewelry that is special to me.", "Yeah, I saw that", ">Have you been to the camps? I have.\n\n\nNo I haven't. My family ran away to Australia and I've never had enough money to fly over. I plan to though.\n\n\n>The mindset that \"dead people have no right to property\" is the same mindset that caused those mountains of property.\n\n\nThere is SO much more to it than that. I don't think you learned very much at the camps if that's what you boil it down to. I recommend starting with \"ur-fascism\" by Umberto Eco if you would like to learn more about fascism. It's very short and easy to grasp.\n\n\n>I'm sorry if you found it disrespectful, it wasn't meant to be.\n\n\nThat's ok. No hard feelings."]}
