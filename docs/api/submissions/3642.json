She died when I was 12. I still wear them to this day.\n\nSo I (30F) have cancer. It's one of the most survivable ones so I'm trying not to be too worried. To be on the safe side though, I decided I would update my will just in case something were to happen. I left the house to my husband (30M) and divided my money three ways to go to him, my daughter (5F), and my sister (29F).However, when my sister found my will she was livid. That was because I had said that if I were to die I would like to be buried with my earrings as they are very special to me. My sister said that she should get the earrings after I die to be close to me.\n\nI don't want to give it to her though. It was given to me as a gift and holds sentimental value. I even got my ears pierced again so that I wouldn't have to swap out the earrings. I told her that it was mine and she wouldn't get it to which she ran to our mom.\n\nMy mom is telling me to give it to her while I'm still alive since my sister is already scared for me and doesn't need this stress. I don't want to but am wondering if I'm the ah if I told her no.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit to clear some stuff up:\n\n1. The earrings are not heirlooms. They were a gift made solely for me.\n2. My sister did not like my grandmother. She even refused a necklace our grandma got her because she thought it was too \"ugly\"\n3. My daughter has many other earrings, necklaces, rings, and other jewelry I'm getting for her.\n4. I'm thinking about finishing the other half-finished set and giving it to my daughter but it's really expensive so I'm not sure\n5. I have thyroid cancer but luckily it was caught early and I am undergoing treatment so please don't worry!\n\nEdit #2:\n\n1. My sister went snooping and found my will in my office. I was leaving her only 20,000 if I were to die\n2. My daughter has way more money than my sister. She'll get 1.3 million dollars after my death. I made it so that she wouldn't get the money too young and live a normal life.\n3. My husband has a very good job and makes 200,000 a year so I'm not worried he won't be able to manage.\n4. I am seriously considering removing my sister completely after her bullshit.\n5. I don't talk to my daughter much about my cancer because I don't want her to think of me as sick so we try to fill up her life with happy memories.\n6. Again, my earrings are not heirlooms. They were made for me and me alone.\n7. The house IS going to my daughter. If me and my husband were to die, she'll be inheriting the house as soon as she turns 21.

You might consider leaving them to your daughter, for whom they might mean as much as they've meant to you.\n\nIn addition to your will, I highly recommend that you update your Living Will, Health Care Power if Attorney, and Durable Power of Attorney.  If your health worsened and you needed someone else to make decisions on your behalf, you might not want your mother or sister to have any room to argue that they should make the decisions for your care.\n\nSimilarly, if your health worsens, consider pre-planning your own funeral arrangements.

Your suggestion that I give away earrings that daily bring me comfort to placate her is outrageous: it would have been insulting enough if you had suggested that I give them to her in my will, but it is utterly unconscionable for you to suggest that I give away things that are meaningful to me while I am still alive. You think Sister doesn't need the stress? I'm literally going through cancer treatment and planning for what will happen if I die, and you care more about Sister's stress than mine? I have dozens of people online telling me that I should cut Sister completely out of my will for this... And maybe I should.

People have requests or plans for their own funerals all of the time. Some want to be cremated, some want a casket, etc. Some people want to be buried with their favorite items as well. Some people plan their whole damn funeral, for goodness sake. The whole \"you won't know because you're dead\" is true (only if that's you're belief) but people do things for those who are deceased all of the time. Like leaving flowers by gravestones or leaving gifts there etc. People who have passed on can't smell or see those flowers or hear when you talk to them. But we still do it. If I was your sister and you left them to me after this I would not even be able to wear them if I knew it was not what you wanted. \n\nIn the end, you do what you want.
