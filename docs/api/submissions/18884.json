They live in hot weather, went to have bbq, sweating, and bringing in outside germs into their bed and sheets which is a breeding ground for germs already.", "No he\u2019s just living in Thailand. It\u2019s just cultural and he didn\u2019t put the details on his post to make his gf bad", "It\u2019s SO satisfying!", "The couch isn\u2019t what you sleep with your face in though, or at least it\u2019s not supposed to be. You sit on the couch w the same clothes you went to work, school, or shopping in, but that is ok because you are sitting up. The couch doesn\u2019t have to be nearly as clean as the bedsheets do, which have to get washed 1-2x weekly, more if a sweaty person is tracking stuff from outside the home. So is she supposed to sleep on a dirty couch, rather than clean linens when she is the one who is cleaner? Why should the cleaner person have to move? Why would it be so hard for him to just take the 15 minutes and shower before bed? Pay to have the couch cleaned once a year and shower daily, right before bed. More times if doing heavy work, before sitting on any furniture. In our home, we got a wipeable couch but that\u2019s because the kids get it dirty multiple times a day w foods, spills, sticky stuff\u2026etc    I don\u2019t think she\u2019s the ah. I think he\u2019s coming from a different background and doesn\u2019t understand. He\u2019s going to have to decide if he is willing to shower daily immediately before bed for the rest of his life, because I can guarantee she will never be comfortable adapting to more dirt/sweat. There will be other areas where she will adapt to his way. That\u2019s just how it is. Easy thing to adapt, just shower and you will both be happy.", "She doesn\u2019t want to share the sheets at the same time with someone who isn\u2019t freshly showered and who has sat jn public places. Probably could have skipped the earlier shower and only taken one shower, but immediately before bed. It\u2019s going somewhere public and the passing of hours adding to the overnight sweat that makes it gross. It\u2019s that he has to shower right before bed.", "Maybe that's why she wants him to take a shower every night.", "I love cerave stuff! Body wash and a facemask of theirs is great, even for super sensitive skin like mine.", "This is me too. If I\u2019m so mad I don\u2019t want to sleep next to him I am quite content taking the couch.", "Well, if she hadn\u2019t just showered and he wasn\u2019t ok with it\u2026then I\u2019d agree w him. Not a gender thing. It\u2019s a shared bed, and a shared home so the standard has to be at the level of whoever has the lowest threshold.", "I wake up after showering so before bed would never work for me unless it was a hygiene thing like I was working outside that day - then it\u2019s a must.", "I'm single but still shower in the evenings partly to keep the bed cleaner. Still OPs GF is being overly picky given an afternoon shower and nothing particularly messy inbetween", "Sure and he says he does it most of the time. \n\nThey were out for just 2 hours. Sounds like a control trip to me.", "Yeh I was born in Panama and my mom is Filipino - it seems like a tropical area thing to shower twice a day across the board. My partner is Columbian and he showers at least twice a day and we dont even live in the tropics anymore, he just sweats alot. Its not OCD or controlling to not want your partner to be unhygenic and sweaty in your shared bed. I s2g these ppl saying N T A would think its controlling for her to ask him to clean his dick before sex."]}
