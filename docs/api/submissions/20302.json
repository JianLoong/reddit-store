It\u2019s been a big shock and adjustment for everyone. \n\n\nMy now husband (35M) proposed on my (33F) birthday in March, he\u2019d already talked to my mum and dad about it. I\u2019m not a fan of big parties, so Husband and I decided to do a small celebration for our engagement, have a nice meal at a fancy hotel, everyone can dress up.\n\nThe more we planned and the more we talked about it. We thought it would be fun to just get married. We have been together for coming up 10 years. Neither of us wanted a big wedding, so we thought a small surprise wedding would suit us. Especially with my dad passing away I didn\u2019t want a traditional big white wedding.\n\nWe invited 10 people, my mum, sister and her partner. His mum, dad, brother, his partner and daughter. We also invited our best friends (who are also in a relationship).\n\nAll goes to plan, everyone arrives, they are escorted into our reserved room where they see a sign saying welcome to the wedding of \u201cHusband and OP\u201d. Everyone is surprised. Our officiant gets people in places. Husband and I walk in together. We get married. Both mums sign the marriage certificate. We go for our sit down meal. \n\nEveryone seemed happy at the time, people were laughing. Saying they should have expected it. We had a photographer there to catch their reaction,ceremony and posed pictures after.\n\nWe went away locally for a small honeymoon. When we have gotten back, both my mum and his mum have pulled us aside separately to say they were disappointed in us. That we had taken away there opportunity to be with us when we chose a venue, did wedding planning stuff. \n\nThey are both especially upset they never came wedding dress shopping with me. Which I ironically didn\u2019t even do, I bought a emerald green 1950s bodycon pencil dress online.

It was mean of them to even bring it up after the fact when nothing can be done.", "NTA. It\u2019s your wedding! And it\u2019s honestly a little selfish of both mums to assume that you took away THEIR experience! They didn\u2019t get married, YOU DID.

And they will learn to get over it.", "NTA, it's your wedding. I wish you best marriage with love and confidence. People often forget weddings are about newlyweds, but feel like they have right to traditions and stuff. So, they just don't want to be happy for you in your way, they want be happy for them in their way.\n\nWhere I came from, traditional weddings are filled with \"funny jokes\" which are funny for everyone except groom and bride. And you know what - when anyone is trying to avoid those they are told that wedding is not for you - it's for everyone else's fun. That's why I asked my husband not to have it at all, upsetting our relatives. And never regretted.", "At least you invited them!  \n\nMy brother just texted us some photos of him in a suit and his long term girlfriend in a wedding dress signing the register (uk registry office wedding).

You and your husband did exactly what you wanted, and what made you happy. That is ALL that should matter. Traditional weddings are stressful and expensive...and quite frankly, outdated.   \nDon't feel bad for one minute about doing things the way you two wanted to do them. The mums will just have to accept it and move on. Shame on them for putting a damper on a day that made you both so happy. \n\nBTW, congratulations :)", "NAH. You got the wedding you wanted. Both moms didn't cause any problems and when they had an issue, they expressed it privately and what sounds like without a bunch of drama.", "Nta. They were involved. You didn\u2019t elope. It gets to look how you wanted it to look. They can be disappointed though about missing out on something they might have been hoping to experience with you, but that doesn\u2019t make anyone TA. Complaining about it to you after the fact is not helpful and only serves to upset the bride/ they should\u2019ve kept their moths shut unless asked how they felt. It wasn\u2019t their wedding.", "NTA, both you and your husband wanted it that way and it was your day. I do understand that with your fathers death you didnt feel like a big celebration. I could be wrong, but maybe you imagined your father walking you down the aisle as well.\nBesides all the money you would have originally spent on one day in your relationship, you can spend now on many days of your marriage or even growing a family", "NTA all the way. this is how you wanted to get married and everyone you both wanted to be there was there. that's all that matters. ps, your dress sounds gorgeous.", "NTA. You were nice enough to include them. It\u2019s your wedding, you get to decide how it goes down. I think it\u2019s super neat", "NTA!!!! Also, congratulations OP! This is the dream. My boyfriend and I plan on eloping in Vegas in a few years. The whole process of planning a wedding, the dress shopping, venue hunting, cake, trying to narrow down lists, trying to make everyone happy and ultimately losing sight of what's important, what YOU and your partner want.... the whole wedding thing IMO is outdated, stressful and I'm all for breaking tradition for the sake of taking care of our own mental health!!!! They'll get over it, glad you were able to capture the moment of everyone's surfing faces!", "NTA your wedding is not about them. You did what was best for you and your husband. Just ignore their comments.", "NTA.\n\nThe wedding industrial complex has run amok. Frankly we should scrap the whole ceremonial nonsense given how much money people waste on it and how much strife it causes.\n\nI got married in my parents front yard after 4 weeks of \u201cplanning\u201d. There were 10 of us and we went to dinner afterwards. It\u2019s a cherished memory.\n\nYour moms are making your wedding about them. As do sooooo many people when it comes to weddings.", "NTA. You do you. Sometimes the small weddings are the best ones. Sometimes you don't need great big huge multi-thousand dollar weddings to make you happy. My second wedding total cost was less than $1000, and it was absolutely a dream come true. I reused my MOH dress from when my mom married my stepdad as my wedding dress. I reused the flowers from her wedding as well. I had less than 20 ppl in attendance. I made the invitations myself (with some help from an online printing website). It was what made ME happy.", "Congratulations!! You and husband did this your way, the way you wanted and that makes you both happy. What is there to complain about?", "NTA--it was your day, and if this is the decision you and your now husband made together and what you wanted to do, that is all that matters.  I can maybe understand some of their upset, but in the end, it is what you two wanted.  I do agree with the idea you both may want to talk to them and let them know that this is what you wanted and that you are sorry if it took something away from them they were looking forward to, but in the end, it was your wedding.", "NAH. Unless your moms pitched a total fit, they have a right to be disappointed to miss those wedding planning moments that they have been looking forward to since you got engaged. Your mom may have been dreaming about them for years! Be gentle with them and plan some girly post-wedding brunches and shopping trips. Or a (tame) bachelorette party!", "NTA. This was your day to celebrate your relationship the way you wanted. The older generation had their chance when it was their turn.", "NTA\n\nThey\u2019re upset you didn\u2019t make your wedding about them. They\u2019ll get over it. It was your wedding and it was never about them. Sounds like not including them in a typical process was a favor you did yourself.", "NTA. They are traditional, you are modern. No one is an AH here. If they push it they might cross the AH line. You could have communicated with them a little better. But other than that it is you and your partner's choice. Not them", "NTA, spending thousands on a big wedding in this climate is ludacris for a lot of people.

I need pics of it ( I just mean the online shop photos!), It sounds lovely!", "NTA your wedding, your life, your choices", "NTA. They're just mad they couldn't railroad your wedding and make it about them. The fact that they're trying to center themselves about your big day proves you did the right thing.", "NTA. Their feelings of disappointment are valid, however, they should keep those to themselves. It wasn't about them at all. I did something very similar, and I have zero regrets. We saved so much money and were able to have an awesome honeymoon without breaking the bank.", "So I\u2019ve kind of been through something similar (got married during Covid, super small, because of the situation there was no chance for dress shopping and planning, etc). My parents knew and my mom and brother flew to Europe for it and we had a small dinner and it was lovely, but it was a surprise to almost everyone else who found out on social media. Here\u2019s my takeaway from the situation:\n\nFirst of you\u2019re NTA! It is your wedding and your choice, full stop.\n\nHowever, you should allow your moms some room to \u201cgrieve\u201d the loss of what they had imagined. Most parents dream about their kids wedding days and the lead up and etc. They had a picture in their mind of how they wanted it to be and that was shattered in a matter of minutes, giving them little time to wrap their head around it.\n\nSo ultimately, I\u2019d say it really depends on HOW they are expressing these emotions to you. Are they acting entitled and berating you and making you feel like shit? Because obviously that\u2019s not okay. Or are they simply expressing disappointment over having a different experience than they had imagined? If that\u2019s the case, stand firm in the fact that you had the wedding you wanted, but give them space to feel those feelings and come to terms with it. It sounds like they are genuinely happy for you and just need some time to accept it\u2019s not what they had imagined.\n\nEDIT: just to add\u2026 because my husband and I live on a different continent than my parents, they really wanted to host a reception for us in their yard (they have a beautiful property). If you and your husband are up for it, maybe this would be a reasonable compromise for your moms. We had a great time at the reception my parents threw us, and costs were low to start with because it\u2019s not an \u201cofficial\u201d wedding, so the pressure was off. The only thing my husband and I paid for was the alcohol and a shuttle to take people home. It worked out great because for us, it wasn\u2019t our actual wedding, so whenever my parents really wanted something a certain way it was like \u201cok sure\u201d. There only ended up being ONE thing with my mom where I had to put my foot down, and luckily my dad had my back.

All of you buy some new outfits...including something for you that would be considered a wedding dress\n\nThen, you can all do a bridal photoshoot\n\nget a really good makeup and hair person, find a place with a vintage vibe so you can do interesting photos...maybe an old mansion or something\n\nMaybe do a spa day before the photoshoot so everyone is relaxed and feeling great\n\nJust something for the 3 of you to share together.\n\nYour husband can do something with the dads that they might all enjoy too.  Im sure they probably won't want to do a photoshoot...but maybe they can do a fishing trip, or go to a car show or a MLB game or something\n\nI think your parents just felt like they missed out on making memories they were expecting to make...so  go make some new memories", "Everything about this wedding ( save for the death of your father, I'm so sorry) sounds fun and awesome!", "NTA I'll never understand why parents feel they are entitled to be included in planning or anything instead of just being happy that their children are happy. \n\nMy mom is 100% fine that she can't come wedding dress shopping with me bc I'm not buying a dress I'm getting one custom made", "NTA.

Hell.\n\nThat\u2019s is extremely selfish, and, im just going to say it; bad parenting. I can totally understand having an expectation through life to want to one day go dress shopping with your daughter. Maybe mum did it with he mum. But sometimes dreams don\u2019t work out. Sometimes your kids don\u2019t act the way you want to. And sometimes you just have to shut up and smile.At the end of the day, you should only want your child to be happy.

My family family had to much input.  My caterer broke her arm and let my Mother know, not me. They cooked differently then my caterer was suppose to.  I wanted something small and intimate it ended up being over 100 people.  Many we were not going to see again.  The DJ, brought 10 people to help him carry things???  Truthfully, they were a friend of my sibling and brought their own party.  The worse was we had a buffet and The new caterer didn\u2019t have enough food and five people ate cereal. \n\nThen the same people who badgered me about the wedding, complained a lot to me.

Could you see your way to maybe indulging us and having an anniversary celebration that we could be involved with? We don\u2019t expect a wedding re-do, but it\u2019d really mean a lot to us if we could plan something to celebrate your marriage.\u201d If they\u2019d come to you with that attitude, you *may* have been more inclined to hear them out (at least I\u2019d hope so). \n \nAnd once everyone has cooled off a bit, I might even spoon-feed that suggestion to them, assuming that you\u2019re interested in repairing these relationships.

Later we had two reception/celebrations and wore our fancy outfits again, one for my family and one for his (two families in two different states across the country from each other) but we didn't repeat our vows or anything like that. That part was just for us. \n\nCongratulations on your wedding! And your dress sounds amazing!", "NTA but your moms certainly are. \n\nIt's incredibly selfish and entitled to call you after your beautiful perfect wedding to complain about it.

It was because her step-mom was trying to force her \"dream wedding\" tick marks onto my wife and my mom was trying to do the same to me. It made the entire process a nightmare to the point I actually suggested eloping one night. Had we knew how to, we prolly would have. Haha.\n\nCongratulations on your wedding.

She's very very recently lost her spouse, and that's a huge change - I can absolutely understand finding the quick switch from 'engagement party' to 'wedding' a lot to deal with, and processing afterwards that a lot of things she'd been looking forward to weren't going to happen. Things to look forward to can see few and far between when you're in deep grief. She's already got a lot to deal with, and I think it'd be good for you to talk it out with her.

Someone mentioned traditions being made by old dead people to discredit them, but marriage is also a tradition. Usually family is very involved in it (which is nice if you have good family and can be a bonding experience).

They really do look forward to it and telling people about all the details leasing up to the big day. \n\nHowever, it's your wedding. You are 100% allowed to do it how you would like. Maybe you could redo wedding photos with you wearing a white dress that you find together. I'm not saying you should re-do the wedding but allow them the special moment of finding the dress and getting ready together. \n\nAt the end of the day, good for doing what you want to do, and congratulations!", "This.", "That seems like a leap.

The wants of anyone who is not the bride or groom are mostly irrelevant.", "Lol what the fuck are you talking about? Are you one of the moms? There's nothing \"deceitful\" about throwing a surprise party. Touch grass.", "> you want to have a small wedding, have a small wedding. If you want to skip dress shopping, skip dress shopping. If you don't want input on the venue, don't accept input on the venue.\n\nThat's....exactly what they did?", "Or be an adult and handle your own business how you please.", "This is horrible advice. OP is an adult with no impairments that render her incapable of making her own decisions.", "Yeah but being an asshole isn\u2019t about giving people what they\u2019re entitled to. It\u2019s about having basic empathy for others. The least OP could\u2019ve done was tell her mom beforehand so she could have dressed how she wanted and been \u201cin on it\u201d. \n\nJust seems like a dick move designed to avoid the slightest bit of conflict. OP could\u2019ve just told everyone they were doing a small wedding.

What a wonderful, joyful event.", "Gotta ask, how did those costumes show up at what was billed as a 'fancy dress party'? ;-)", "Agreed. It's your wedding and you can decide how you want to do it. I'm sorry if the moms were sad they didn't get to experience picking out the venue, the dress, etc. but if they want to experience that so badly they can get married themselves. This isn't about them.\n\nThe only downside I can see to surprising guests with a wedding would be if they felt underdressed/not looking their best and not ready for pictures, not coming last minute because they felt a little under the weather, wore white and felt guilty about it, etc..

Plus, based on their comments, and witnessing the trauma that traditional wedding planning has had on women in my life, you escaped a process that would have made you miserable. I don't know what it is. Maybe it's like generational trauma where the mom's got railroaded by their moms so they want the weddings of their children to be vicariously what they wanted? Anyways, it's obvious they would have made the whole thing about them.", "I would say that this could be a big surprise but I do understand the mom's point of view to an extent. As much as your marriage is your big day, I believe a marriage is about everyone in your life that you want to share your love with. As always, to each their own, but I feel like having them there for the wedding is much better than eloping. Either way I wish you and your husband the best of luck and hope everyone has a good laugh, sounds like a very fun experience that I would of loved!", "I mean in this case it\u2019s peer pressure from your widowed mother who wanted to be involved in a huge milestone of your life.", "I love this phrase.

Definitely stealing it too!", "On your side, having lost your father so recently, it's kind of understandable if your mom is disappointed.  Perhaps to her, a \"normal\" wedding would have been a welcome distraction, or a return to her idea of normalcy.

It may  be understandable, but that doesn't mean she is correct to take it out on you. (Even mildly.)\n\nYOU also lost your father, you have your own feelings, along with your husband.  This was \\*your\\* wedding, not Family Therapy.\n\nYou don't have to be harsh with the moms, or apologize.  If you want to try to talk to them about it, you could try the approach of saying that you get why they're disappointed, but you were never going to want the kind of traditional wedding they are picturing.  You and your husband needed it to be this way. \n\nI think people do get too hung up on \"milestone\" occasions, and getting to participate in them, or not.  Your moms both had ideas in their head of how a wedding \"should\" go, and it would always have been a struggle to get them to let go of those ideas.  I think the way you did it was the best way for everyone -- you got the kind of wedding you wanted, they WERE involved in celebrating it with you (you didn't just elope and tell no one!), and you avoided all of the drama that could have happened beforehand with them and other family members arguing with you.\n\nI probably wouldn't be so blunt as to tell them \"it wasn't your wedding, it was ours\" -- but that's what you can tell any other family members who try to bring it up.\n\nNTA!", "NTA\u2026.

I would say, you are NTA but treat the mums with compassion, they are disappointed and maybe you can offer a compromise where they help you plan next year's anniversary party?

I have to do what is right for me.\"", "Once I finally got away from my parents, and most of my family, and was able to see them in a different light, and all these \"traditions\" I thought I was supposed to maintain, I just realized that it's all bullshit, and everybody should be able to live the life they want, regardless of whatever traditions.

When people identify their emotions, it's very common to then process it by justifying the emotion: 'if I feel sad it must be because OP messed up.' Then, chastising you about it is taking it even further.

Those feelings may have caught her by surprise at your event, & she may be putting those feelings into something she can more clearly articulate & that your husband\u2019s mother can also feel, which is \u201chow dare you not let me share in planning your special day.\u201d", "update would be nice.\n\nAlso congratulations of course :)", "NAH is the most insanely underused verdict on this subreddit, I guess because people are just incredibly eager to assign blame where none is necessary.\n\nI could totally understand why the moms would have their feelings hurt by this, even if OP and their partner didn\u2019t technically do anything wrong.", "To me the issue is that it's an AH move to presume *any* role in someone else's wedding to the point of expressing \"disappointment\" or \"upset\", no matter the relationship. The normal-ness of the conversation doesn't change the evident intent of the moms to enforce traditional norms in a selfishly inappropriate way. \n\nThe moms aren't *big* AHs, but they are AHs to me nonetheless.", "Or because they're mature adults who can put their own feelings on the shelf during the event to be happy for the couple, and then communicate them later on in a more appropriate setting instead of holding on to them and letting them fester.", "I don\u2019t disagree with you!

I might share my disappointment with my husband or sisters but I wouldn\u2019t ever say anything to my daughters. \n\nAs a wedding planner, this scenario sadly happens a lot. I hate seeing it happen but I do understand the feelings that motivate these conversations. I do often encourage families to keep any of their criticisms to themselves after a wedding because it will change the memory of the day. That\u2019s never helpful or fun for anyone.

But parents and grandparents come from a time when these events and ceremonies were important. \n\nChoosing a wedding dress, for example, is a way to celebrate your daughter\u2019s passage into adulthood, and the event where she will leave your home and go and form her own family. In the very old days, she would leave to go to live with her husband\u2019s family - hence the need for events and ceremonies to draw the two families closer. \n\nWe don\u2019t articulate these cultural changes very well - which is why we see so many wedding stories here and in the relationship subs. \n\nUltimately, OP can do whatever the hell she likes. Of course she can.

And it will be as hurtful and distressing to her Mum as springing a wedding on her in the first place (like, not even a heads-up so her mum can get her head straight about it ?)

How dare our grown children not inform us of the decision they made together as a grown couple!\u201d \n\nSounds stupid, right?? The married couple had no obligation to tell them of the wedding.

What if a set of parents had been saving for their respective children\u2019s weddings for years, planning it to a T, only to find out that their children don\u2019t want to get married. Are they selfish then, for not getting married at their parents wishes? Are they disappointments, for not wanting something that their parents wanted? \n\nChildren are not an extension of their parents, and parents do not get to be the authority of the child\u2019s life up until they die.

You're literally not even considering the mom as a person with feelings. Her husband just died. She's got a lot going on. \n\nEntitlement would be demanding they redo the wedding, or atleast get a photoshoot done. Entitlement would be demanding the next milestone to include them.

It might not have been what you wanted or expected, but can you find it in your hearts to let it go for our sake?\"\n\nI honestly think most people don't really understand where their emotional responses are coming from in moments like these.

If you want a huge wedding for your kid and a year planning and all the bullshit that goes through it that's fine, if you are disappointed in a person because they got the wedding they wanted, you're an asshole and no one should validate such a shitty feeling.\n\nIf they'd casually talked about missing out on dress shopping that's one thing, but this was more of a pointed attack at op.", "I hear what you are saying, but there was always going to be some hurt.

I'm sure it would have been hard not having the dad be a part of the big day, but things like weddings can help people. They give you something to look forward to, and when you're grieving, it's hard to find any joy. \n\nAgain, I don't think anyone is the ahole.

Fixing it is not your responsibility.\n\nThat said, everyone is on their own path to how they relate with themselves and others. OP is already further along this path than their mom is, just by nature of asking this question and the way they\u2019re examining it.\n\nI think we might be crossing wires on what \u201cvalidate\u201d means here. Imagine you\u2019re OP\u2019s mom (can\u2019t type that with a straight face). You have a kid, you raise them, they leave home, you\u2019re left being like what is my purpose in life now? You\u2019re old and you\u2019re trying to figure out your place in the world. OP getting married is the last stop on the train, there\u2019s a finality to it culturally. Now my kid is out in the world and they\u2019re going to have their own family and they\u2019ve not only left the nest they\u2019re building their own nest.\n\nAlso you\u2019re four months out from your husband suddenly dying a decade before that even seems like a possibility, and you\u2019re definitely not over that yet. You\u2019re a boomer so you probably haven\u2019t gone to any therapy to figure out how to relate to all of this.\n\nYou start thinking about how at least you\u2019re going to get this last shared project/bonding experience before that happens, like you did with your mom perhaps when you got married. You\u2019re excited for the engagement party. Now you get there and your kid is like surprise we\u2019re getting married. You don\u2019t make a scene, you want them to be happy, you enjoy the party everything is great.\n\nAfterwards you\u2019re alone in your house, not in contact with your kid as they\u2019re off on their honeymoon and you don\u2019t want to interrupt or bring them down, but you\u2019re feeling really, really sad.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nOk pause here. Everything up through this point is deeply human, completely reasonable, and not at all problematic. When I say validate, I mean validate everything up above. Show empathy and care and understanding, help her feel seen.\n\nShe expressed her pain by telling OP that she was disappointed in her. That\u2019s not a very healthy way to approach the conversation, and I super understand why OP felt shitty afterwards. The issue here is you cannot solve two problems at the same time while resolving conflict, it\u2019s impossible. So, one person has to hold space for the other so the other can resolve their hurt, and then the other side can be resolved immediately afterwards.\n\nSo my advice would be to empathize and hear the pain that OP\u2019s mom is feeling, help her feel seen and understood. And once she\u2019s there, you say \u201chey, when you pulled me aside and said you were disappointed in me about the wedding, it made me feel really shit. I wanted to celebrate someone I love with the people I love, and it made me feel like my wedding only mattered if it was done the way that you wanted.\u201d\n\nAnd if she\u2019s felt heard and understood on all the above, she will be way, way, way more likely to say \u201chey I\u2019m really sorry, I can see how that hurt\u201d.", "AITA for having a spur of the moment surprise wedding, even though my dad just died and my mum is grieving ?\n\nAt all points OP is putting her fun wedding above the feelings of her grieving mum.

Her brother wrote a really sociopathic letter to her arguing that she should not have married someone with my disability. \n\nWhich made it that much more confusing. Because they still centered so much of their complaining at us on the fact that we didn\u2019t include them.
