It\u2019s been a big shock and adjustment for everyone. \n\n\nMy now husband (35M) proposed on my (33F) birthday in March, he\u2019d already talked to my mum and dad about it. I\u2019m not a fan of big parties, so Husband and I decided to do a small celebration for our engagement, have a nice meal at a fancy hotel, everyone can dress up.\n\nThe more we planned and the more we talked about it. We thought it would be fun to just get married. We have been together for coming up 10 years. Neither of us wanted a big wedding, so we thought a small surprise wedding would suit us. Especially with my dad passing away I didn\u2019t want a traditional big white wedding.\n\nWe invited 10 people, my mum, sister and her partner. His mum, dad, brother, his partner and daughter. We also invited our best friends (who are also in a relationship).\n\nAll goes to plan, everyone arrives, they are escorted into our reserved room where they see a sign saying welcome to the wedding of \u201cHusband and OP\u201d. Everyone is surprised. Our officiant gets people in places. Husband and I walk in together. We get married. Both mums sign the marriage certificate. We go for our sit down meal. \n\nEveryone seemed happy at the time, people were laughing. Saying they should have expected it. We had a photographer there to catch their reaction,ceremony and posed pictures after.\n\nWe went away locally for a small honeymoon. When we have gotten back, both my mum and his mum have pulled us aside separately to say they were disappointed in us. That we had taken away there opportunity to be with us when we chose a venue, did wedding planning stuff. \n\nThey are both especially upset they never came wedding dress shopping with me. Which I ironically didn\u2019t even do, I bought a emerald green 1950s bodycon pencil dress online.

It was mean of them to even bring it up after the fact when nothing can be done.", "NTA. It\u2019s your wedding!

And they will learn to get over it.", "NTA, it's your wedding. I wish you best marriage with love and confidence. People often forget weddings are about newlyweds, but feel like they have right to traditions and stuff. So, they just don't want to be happy for you in your way, they want be happy for them in their way.\n\nWhere I came from, traditional weddings are filled with \"funny jokes\" which are funny for everyone except groom and bride. And you know what - when anyone is trying to avoid those they are told that wedding is not for you - it's for everyone else's fun. That's why I asked my husband not to have it at all, upsetting our relatives. And never regretted.", "At least you invited them!  \n\nMy brother just texted us some photos of him in a suit and his long term girlfriend in a wedding dress signing the register (uk registry office wedding).  They used two strangers as witnesses.\n\nBoth our family and her family were sad we didn\u2019t get to celebrate with them but what can we do!", "NTA \n\nYou had the wedding you wanted and their feelings about it are theirs to deal with", "NTA\n\nWhat I have trouble comprehending is that people don't seem to understand that a wedding is about what the bride and groom want....NO ONE ELSE. You and your husband did exactly what you wanted, and what made you happy. That is ALL that should matter. Traditional weddings are stressful and expensive...and quite frankly, outdated.   \nDon't feel bad for one minute about doing things the way you two wanted to do them. The mums will just have to accept it and move on. Shame on them for putting a damper on a day that made you both so happy. \n\nBTW, congratulations :)", "NAH. You got the wedding you wanted. Both moms didn't cause any problems and when they had an issue, they expressed it privately and what sounds like without a bunch of drama.", "Nta. They were involved. You didn\u2019t elope. It gets to look how you wanted it to look. They can be disappointed though about missing out on something they might have been hoping to experience with you, but that doesn\u2019t make anyone TA. Complaining about it to you after the fact is not helpful and only serves to upset the bride/ they should\u2019ve kept their moths shut unless asked how they felt. It wasn\u2019t their wedding.", "NTA, both you and your husband wanted it that way and it was your day. I do understand that with your fathers death you didnt feel like a big celebration. I could be wrong, but maybe you imagined your father walking you down the aisle as well.\nBesides all the money you would have originally spent on one day in your relationship, you can spend now on many days of your marriage or even growing a family", "NTA all the way. this is how you wanted to get married and everyone you both wanted to be there was there. that's all that matters. ps, your dress sounds gorgeous.", "NTA. You were nice enough to include them. It\u2019s your wedding, you get to decide how it goes down. I think it\u2019s super neat", "NTA!!!! Also, congratulations OP! This is the dream. My boyfriend and I plan on eloping in Vegas in a few years. The whole process of planning a wedding, the dress shopping, venue hunting, cake, trying to narrow down lists, trying to make everyone happy and ultimately losing sight of what's important, what YOU and your partner want.... the whole wedding thing IMO is outdated, stressful and I'm all for breaking tradition for the sake of taking care of our own mental health!!!! They'll get over it, glad you were able to capture the moment of everyone's surfing faces!", "NTA your wedding is not about them. You did what was best for you and your husband. Just ignore their comments.", "NTA.\n\nThe wedding industrial complex has run amok. Frankly we should scrap the whole ceremonial nonsense given how much money people waste on it and how much strife it causes.\n\nI got married in my parents front yard after 4 weeks of \u201cplanning\u201d. There were 10 of us and we went to dinner afterwards. It\u2019s a cherished memory.\n\nYour moms are making your wedding about them. As do sooooo many people when it comes to weddings.", "NTA. You do you. Sometimes the small weddings are the best ones. Sometimes you don't need great big huge multi-thousand dollar weddings to make you happy. My second wedding total cost was less than $1000, and it was absolutely a dream come true. I reused my MOH dress from when my mom married my stepdad as my wedding dress. I reused the flowers from her wedding as well. I had less than 20 ppl in attendance. I made the invitations myself (with some help from an online printing website). It was what made ME happy.", "Congratulations!! You and husband did this your way, the way you wanted and that makes you both happy. What is there to complain about?", "NTA--it was your day, and if this is the decision you and your now husband made together and what you wanted to do, that is all that matters.  I can maybe understand some of their upset, but in the end, it is what you two wanted.  I do agree with the idea you both may want to talk to them and let them know that this is what you wanted and that you are sorry if it took something away from them they were looking forward to, but in the end, it was your wedding.", "NAH. Unless your moms pitched a total fit, they have a right to be disappointed to miss those wedding planning moments that they have been looking forward to since you got engaged. Your mom may have been dreaming about them for years! Be gentle with them and plan some girly post-wedding brunches and shopping trips. Or a (tame) bachelorette party!", "NTA. This was your day to celebrate your relationship the way you wanted. The older generation had their chance when it was their turn.", "NTA\n\nThey\u2019re upset you didn\u2019t make your wedding about them. They\u2019ll get over it. It was your wedding and it was never about them. Sounds like not including them in a typical process was a favor you did yourself.", "NTA. They are traditional, you are modern. No one is an AH here. If they push it they might cross the AH line. You could have communicated with them a little better. But other than that it is you and your partner's choice. Not them", "NTA, spending thousands on a big wedding in this climate is ludacris for a lot of people.

Sounds fun, but I can understand why your parents didn\u2019t appreciate being tricked.", "Why are they spoiling your first few days as newlyweds? Are they both so selfish and entitled?

I need pics of it ( I just mean the online shop photos!), It sounds lovely!", "NTA your wedding, your life, your choices", "NTA. They're just mad they couldn't railroad your wedding and make it about them. The fact that they're trying to center themselves about your big day proves you did the right thing.", "NTA. Their feelings of disappointment are valid, however, they should keep those to themselves. It wasn't about them at all. I did something very similar, and I have zero regrets. We saved so much money and were able to have an awesome honeymoon without breaking the bank.", "So I\u2019ve kind of been through something similar (got married during Covid, super small, because of the situation there was no chance for dress shopping and planning, etc). My parents knew and my mom and brother flew to Europe for it and we had a small dinner and it was lovely, but it was a surprise to almost everyone else who found out on social media. Here\u2019s my takeaway from the situation:\n\nFirst of you\u2019re NTA! It is your wedding and your choice, full stop.\n\nHowever, you should allow your moms some room to \u201cgrieve\u201d the loss of what they had imagined. Most parents dream about their kids wedding days and the lead up and etc. They had a picture in their mind of how they wanted it to be and that was shattered in a matter of minutes, giving them little time to wrap their head around it.\n\nSo ultimately, I\u2019d say it really depends on HOW they are expressing these emotions to you. Are they acting entitled and berating you and making you feel like shit? Because obviously that\u2019s not okay. Or are they simply expressing disappointment over having a different experience than they had imagined? If that\u2019s the case, stand firm in the fact that you had the wedding you wanted, but give them space to feel those feelings and come to terms with it. It sounds like they are genuinely happy for you and just need some time to accept it\u2019s not what they had imagined.", "NTA. It's your wedding and it sounds awesome. I can understand that your Mum and MIL had a vision of what the wedding would be and that didn't happen so they are disappointed but I think they are being a bit selfish to be honest! You had a lovely wedding and did exactly what you wanted and now they are taking the shine off it by complaining because you didn't do it how they wanted you to do it.", "NTA. Your wedding. The fact that they even said anything means you probably dodged a bullet. It would have been a fight for control with both of them the whole way.", "NTA. I wanted to do something like this when we were engaged. We had just bought our house and I floated the idea of inviting everyone for a combination engagement party/housewarming and surprising them with a wedding. Hubs didn't care for the idea so we got to put up with months of arguing and guilt tripping by our (mostly my) families instead.", "Meh NTA\n\nIf they want to plan a wedding, they should marry each other and plan one. It's your day and honestly it sounds perfect.", "NTA.", "NAH\n\nThey have a right to feel disappointed\n\nAnd you have a right to feel the way you feel\n\nAnd while it was a bit rude of them to put this all on you....I don't think this is a hill worth dying on\n\nBut I have a solution\n\nDo a photoshoot\n\nGo dress shopping with the two of them.  All of you buy some new outfits...including something for you that would be considered a wedding dress\n\nThen, you can all do a bridal photoshoot\n\nget a really good makeup and hair person, find a place with a vintage vibe so you can do interesting photos...maybe an old mansion or something\n\nMaybe do a spa day before the photoshoot so everyone is relaxed and feeling great\n\nJust something for the 3 of you to share together.\n\nYour husband can do something with the dads that they might all enjoy too.  Im sure they probably won't want to do a photoshoot...but maybe they can do a fishing trip, or go to a car show or a MLB game or something\n\nI think your parents just felt like they missed out on making memories they were expecting to make...so  go make some new memories", "Everything about this wedding ( save for the death of your father, I'm so sorry) sounds fun and awesome!", "NTA I'll never understand why parents feel they are entitled to be included in planning or anything instead of just being happy that their children are happy. \n\nMy mom is 100% fine that she can't come wedding dress shopping with me bc I'm not buying a dress I'm getting one custom made", "NTA. They had dreams, they were not fulfilled. That\u2019s not your fault, nor your job to do. \n\nI had a small wedding, not a surprise. I ordered my dress online and didn\u2019t include my parents in any planning", "NTA: I work almost exclusively in the wedding industry. I\u2019m a videographer and I love it. YOU got married.. nobody else. Traditions need to die in a fiery pot and the ashes get scattered on the courthouse floor bc that\u2019s where 50% of peoples marriage will end up dieing\u2026 And you know what? I see more people doing traditional bs to appease their parents look miserable on their wedding day than I care to admit. \n\nIf you want to get married at a circus and have a screaming elephant as your officiant\u2026 by god do it. Because your mutual love is really and truly the only thing that matters. Being YOUrself is true love. Not what anyone else says.", "NTA, it sounded marvelous!", "I would be disappointed and upset too if one of my daughters did that,  especially shortly after losing my husband. But it's your wedding and your decision to make and your right not to involve anyone else, so NTA.", "I\u2019m sorry your mothers sucked some of the joy of your wedding from you. It wasn\u2019t about them. They should be happy for you. If they can\u2019t, they should keep that bullshit to themselves and commiserate together over a glass of wine. Sorry. My mother pulled a similar stunt the week after my wedding and 27 years later, it still stings.", "NTA. What. The. Holey. Hell.\n\nThat\u2019s is extremely selfish, and, im just going to say it; bad parenting. I can totally understand having an expectation through life to want to one day go dress shopping with your daughter. Maybe mum did it with he mum. But sometimes dreams don\u2019t work out. Sometimes your kids don\u2019t act the way you want to. And sometimes you just have to shut up and smile.At the end of the day, you should only want your child to be happy. I appreciate they didn\u2019t say anything day of. But why they waited until after the honeymoon was over is beyond me because at that point all it does is possibly cast a shadow over the events. Tell them they can keep their self pity parties in their pockets.", "NTA. My baby sister did this about 15 years ago. It was great. The only one that knew about the wedding was me. She knew I wouldn\u2019t drive 10 hours just for an engagement party.  \n\nEveryone loved it.", "I totally get why you wanted to do this  I was engaged shortly before my Dad died. The thought of a big white wedding with no Dad to walk me down the aisle just brought me to tears every time I thought about it. The wedding never happened for various other reasons but you are entitled to live your life the way that serves you best, you owe nobody and frankly they should be more understanding of your situation and feelings.", "Nta it\u2019s your wedding not theirs and tbh this sounds like exactly what I\u2019d prefer to do! Just thinking about planning a wedding sounds exhausting and I don\u2019t even have a partner yet.", "NTA. The only wedding for which a person is entitled to be part of the planning is their own. Your mom and MIL each had their turn, when they were planning their own weddings. It was your turn to have your wedding the way you and your partner wanted. You aren\u2019t an asshole for not catering to your mom and MIL\u2019s misplaced expectations. You didn\u2019t ask them for money and then ice them out of planning, you simply planned what you wanted, made it happen, and invited them as guests. They have nothing to be upset about. \n\nYou\u2019re an adult, and you were entitled to have the low-stress wedding that you wanted. Had you let them in on the planning, there\u2019s a good chance that at least one of them would\u2019ve made it way more stressful for you, by trying to take over and make it about what they wanted. Plus, telling 2 more people about the \u201csurprise wedding\u201d would\u2019ve made it\u2026not really a surprise. Someone probably would\u2019ve spilled the beans.", "NTA, Your moms are being unfair in making your wedding about them. They will get over it. If you wanted an uncomplicated wedding you made the correct choice. It sounds like you would have been pressured into that more fancy white wedding neither of you wanted.", "They are rather assuming that you wanted their opinions.\n\nThey (I am assuming) had their weddings. They got to choose how to do things. This was the wedding you wanted. Stress-free, Sounds great.\n\nNTA I'm sure hey will get over it.", "NTA. \n\nYour party, your rules.", "NTA. Well played =)", "NTA.  I'm confused that they seem to think your wedding is about them.  What a strange thing to feel entitled about.", "I will never understand parents who think they own their children\u2019s big life experiences. It\u2019s YOUR wedding, not theirs. Nta", "NTA", "NAH. It\u2019s sounds like you had a wonderful time! You should have the wedding you want. \n\nHowever, I don\u2019t think your mums are AH either. They didn\u2019t say or do anything on the day. It doesn\u2019t sound like they are being unkind or stomping their feet. \nIt just sounds like they want you to know that their feelings were hurt. \n\nWould it be better for them to say nothing? Yes. However, I don\u2019t think speaking up makes them AH in this situation. \n\nCongratulations you on your wedding! I wish you and your partner all the best!", "NTA\n\n'We're disappointed that you think it's okay to make a decision about our life all about yourselves. Please take some time to reflect on your actions and let us know if this is the type of behaviour we should expect going forward so we can plan your involvement accordingly. You're entitled to your feelings of disappointment but please don't make them about us. They are a you problem. If you need help navigating them we can assist you in finding a therapist, telling us we're the root cause is not the answer.'", ">When we have gotten back, both my mum and his mum have pulled us aside separately to say they were disappointed in us. That we had taken away there opportunity to be with us when we chose a venue, did wedding planning stuff.\n\nSometimes you disappoint people. They have to accept it and let it go. Even if you did plan a wedding, you might not have done half those things. You didn't dress shop like that. Lots of people don't take their parents on those visits because the parents can't calm down. NTA because they should have just kept their mouths shut. All they did was diminish your happiness and hurt your relationships for something you can't take back.", "Nope NTA you invited them to celebrate your union on your terms, that's the point this is a celebration of how you and your husband are tag teaming life.  The big extravagant ultra expensive wedding is IMO a fully unnecessary detail in a happy relationship.  If the family is disappointed that they didn't get to participate in a fantasy that no one but they gad its not on you.  Congratulations btw.", "NTA You realize that if the mums had got their way, your wedding would have looked very different?\n\nWould you have gone dress-shopping with them just for their pleasure, even though you didn\u2019t want a white wedding dress? Looked for a venue that you didn\u2019t want? Etc\u2026", "NTA \n\nIt was you wedding! Not theirs! I get that they might be a little bit disapointed but that is their problem not yours", "NTA.  Both of them are wrong. Congratulations!", "The important people still in your life were involved with the wedding, they attended it. You are NTA for not going about it the way they wanted it to.", "NTA.  It was your wedding and you did it your way.  Big weddings are overrated.", "The mums aren't owed anything in OPs wedding.  I think this is a great idea!\n\nI went to a fancy dress party for a friends 50th birthday a couple of years ago.  We get there and it's actually their wedding.  They had been together 20 years and only their kids (from previous marriages) knew.  \n\nThe wedding pictures were hilarious!  Bride and groom standing for formal family shots (in bridal dress and morning suit) next to Spiderman, a vampire, Willy Wonka, Churchill and a sexy lion.  It was absolutely ludicrous and absolutely perfect.", "Thank you! Someone recently told me that traditions are just peer pressure from dead people. I don\u2019t think I can look at traditions the same way again x", "Thank you! That is probably a conversation we will have to have with them", "My sister and her fiance did the same thing, invited their parents and children to an engagement party which was actually their wedding.  It was great, low key, cheap, no stress - I'd recommend it for anyone!", "Actually, they did take away something. Their chance to try and take over the planning, their chance to complain, their chance to criticize something the couple decided on and, now this is my favorite,  their chance to complain that they weren't allowed to invite their friends that they don't even know. \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "It is mind-blowing how much unnecessary drama weddings generate in families. And I say this as someone whose small, low-key wedding created a family rift that persists to this day due to the guest list. I think everyone needs to find other stuff to get their knickers in a twist over.", "The moms could have looked over her shoulder while she googled for the right dress, I suppose?  Maybe could have done a screen share with Zoom. \ud83d\ude44", "I think it's a weird generational thing. My mom was super upset and angry when we were planning our wedding. She kept saying we weren't involing her enough and she felt \"pushed out\" of the process. After attempts to include her more didn't stop the arguments she finally revealed the real reason was that she thought it was \"weird\" my husband was helping me plan and \"a mother daughter plan the wedding together, he shouldn't be this involved\". It just seems to be the default expectation in older generations that the women (mother of the bride, and sometimes mother of the groom) are entitled to input and not letting them have that is robbing them of a milestone experience.", "They probably did it privately because someone else would've called them out on it.", "I agree we probably could have communicated better. We both agreed that neither of our mums can keep a secret to save their lives and they would have gone around telling everyone, which would have lead to more stress for us about why people weren\u2019t invited", "This is literally our plan we are currently working on\u2026 \ud83d\ude02\n\nI agree completely, OP. It\u2019s selfish AF for your moms to make this about THEM! \n\nAnd also\u2026 dress tax? That dress sounds hella cute!!! Show us the link!", "Oh my god I love it when a couple turns a Halloween or costume party into a wedding! The pictures are iconic!", "I want to upvote this a thousand times!", "That is one of my favorite sayings! I said it to my mom once and she looked shook, lol.", "I am totally stealing that expression.\nNTA", "Yes, when you lose someone so important in your life, all other things seem so insignificant. You do get a different perspective and you did what you both thought would be the best considering everything. I am so sorry for your loss OP and congratulations on the wedding! NTA", "Wish I knew that one for my previous interactions with my sister's MIL.", "NTA. It\u2019s yours, and your husband\u2019s wedding and you did what YOU wanted. Tell the mums you\u2019re sorry they are disappointed, but it was your choice and you had a wonderful time. Can they please respect that, as the complaints are starting to spoil the post-wedding buzz for you both. \n\nYou made the right choice. Female relatives especially are a pain in the hoop when it comes to wedding planning. Getting constant \u201cwell, it\u2019s your choice but\u2026\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m not interfering, but\u2026\u201d \u201cit\u2019s not up to me\u2026\u201d \u201cso and so\u2019s friends cousin got married there and she said\u2026\u201d", "This is the best worded answer. You are NTA.\n\nI think sometimes people enjoy having events and experiences to look forward to. Although there were no specific plans, your mothers made assumptions and are now a bit disappointed that some of those things they were looking forward to (but you weren't) aren't happening. Maybe suggest some other things you can do together to celebrate something (birthday, graduation, anniversary?), spend time together, and maybe dress up a bit. It doesn't need to be \"this is to celebrate my wedding\" but maybe \"MIL let's do a fancy girl's brunch with SIL\" and make a reservation at a really nice place so they can dress up. If they really just feel like they missed out on experiences, you can still do special bonding things without the wedding pressure hanging over you.", "That's right. Just to look. Not to comment, or try to influence her choice or pressure her in any way to do what they wanted.", "Yep. Super obvious they were aware that during the wedding was neither the time nor place to air minor grievances.", "I don't blame them for being let down, but it's probably something they should've kept to themselves. \n\nIt's harder to keep something to yourself when you have a sounding board echoing your disappointment, since clearly the moms were *both* feeling like they've missed out. \n\nBut, ultimately they're allowed to have feelings. A lot of parents dream about their children's milestones.", "But if it was a surprise there was nothing to communicate. You honestly had my dream wedding. Plus you saved everyone thousands of dollars, plus both of your siblings have partners, so that\u2019s two more potential weddings they can focus on", "Unless one of them gets mad that a guest came dressed as the Corpse Bride.", "Me too!", "Oh my god I remember that"]}
