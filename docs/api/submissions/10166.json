In this case, the organization sponsoring this trip may want to:\n\n- provide a safe space for BIPOC that doesn\u2019t include any white people, something BIPOC often don\u2019t get \n\n- ensure the most BIPOC people possible get the opportunity to experience this trip, which means reserving all spaces for them\n\n- maximize the impact of any dollars they are putting towards administrative costs of the trip, above and beyond fees charged to participants\n\nThose are all valid and *not personal to you* even though in this case they impact you. In other words, if you feel disappointed to not be able to go, that\u2019s okay, but consider directing that disappointment at the people and systems that necessitated BIPOCs needing to have special trips like this to counteract their disenfranchisement in our society.", "INFO: why do you think this trip was for BIPOC only? What is your take?", "NAH\n\nBut you also can't expect a group to accept you when they've advertise they wouldn't accept you.   \nIf it's a BIPOC group - Black, indigenous and people of color - you are neither. And while i certainly understand being hurt by it, Your girlfriend should've never went against what the website said, and instead you should've went camping together on your own.", "Shutting down Reddit for the evening. I'm sure I will wake up to many more replies but a special shoutout to u/OkSeat4312 and u/myironlions for providing not only great insight, but an empathy and care that was not shown in every response. I'm beyond appreciative for all who took the time to share their views, and for those of the BIPOC community frustrated with having to repeat themselves, I still tremendously appreciate you taking the time to engage. The results seem to be a mixed bag, but the insights and opinions have given me much to learn from. Much love to all! :)", "NAH.\n\nYou are not the AH for your being hurt or disapointed about missing a trip that sounded fun (that was the question) . However you are starting to cross that line by dwelling on it and trying to justify why you should be allowed.\n\n Some BIPOC  spaces/events are open to white partners/friends. Some are not.  No matter how much you have lived around other cultures and no matter how understanding you have been, you are not BIPOC. You don't have life experience as  BIPOC.  They want a trip for only people that have experienced  camping being not expected of them as as they are POC, with camping often seen a white person \"thing\".   If you told coworkers/casual acquaintances you were going camping next weekend, you wouldn't get a \"really, I wouldn't think that's something you would be into\" because of just the color of your skin.  The people that would have had THAT experience is who they want to experience that trip.   \n\nBut end of the day, if someone says you are not included in attending a group, especially a group that is intended to  create a safe space for a demographic you do not belong to, being disappointed is fine, but when you start justifying why you should be allowed, that's going to make you TA.\n\nIf there are exceptions to a rule, the person who makes that rule is the one that determines what the exceptions are, not the one that wants to be the exception.  If there are no exceptions to a rule, only TA is going to explain why they should be one anyway\n\nMaybe see if the group sometimes has events that non bipoc partners are allowed to also attend, if not maybe look for other groups, or make your own group of people to go camping with.", "NAH My feelings about this are complicated because, well, my race is kinda complicated. I'm half Latina, but the vast majority of people view me as white. My dad (the Latino parent) and brother both pass in both white and Latino settings for the most part, though we think my brother has been profiled a few times. (Everyone always talks about his \"dark coloring like T\u00edo Freddy.\")\n\nBeing KINDA a POC but also kinda not has led to some very confusing feelings. Black folks I've met who can pass as white have expressed similar feelings. But for me...I'm practically TRANSLUCENT. I'm paler than my mom and simply don't tan (and rarely burn). We think it's partly due to a genetic disorder because I was at least a little darker and could tan when I was younger.\n\nThe point is that people often don't believe me when I say I'm Latina. I received a minority fellowship in grad school, and I got some Looks at the reception. I feel disconnected with a part of my heritage and desperate to connect with it. I feel like when I dress up in traditional clothing, certain members of my community might be thinking \"appropriation.\" I feel like I REALLY stand out as this white woman in the Midwest who, rather than being mild-mannered, is brash and loud. And I know a TON of this is probably more my insecurities than anything people are actually thinking, but the \"No way you're Latina!\" comments have sent me down these thought spirals.\n\nSo when I come across things like that organization, it brings up all kinds of feelings about who counts as a real Latino and what they'd make of a family like mine and who gets to decide who's BIPOC enough, etc. But at the same time...I completely get where my presence at such a gathering, even though they'd likely let me come, could make people uncomfortable.\n\nAnd the truth is that my experiences ARE very difference from other POC's. They're certainly not like the average white person's, but I have not experienced the discrimination that is an everyday fact of life for people who PRESENT as POC. I can't relate to those experiences, and sometimes people need to be in a setting where there are only those who can relate. I get this from being disabled. There are just so many things able-bodied people don't get and can't. I don't even want to be in a support group setting. I don't need to sit there and complain or get advice. But being with people who understand that I'm frequently going to be late or have to bail because of my disability, who don't comment on every food restriction, who don't exclaim, \"But you're so young to be so sick!\" or \"You're an inspiration!\" or \"I don't know how you live like that...\" is so damn priceless.\n\nIt's okay to have complicated feelings about this, but just remind yourself (and your girlfriend!) that it's not about you, and you can have other opportunities. And maybe even contact them to ask if they'd be willing to do a special trip that includes white family members if others are interested?\n\nEdit: typos", "NTA-You\u2019re entitled to feel the way you do.\n\nThat said, find coping mechanisms for this. This is just the tip of the iceberg. Trust me. My husband and I are about to hit 30 years together and have raised our 3 mixed-race adult children. We are strong and united, but after every battle, another one comes. We have learned lots of little things to help. We hold hands EVERYWHERE, to avoid the hurt that comes with strangers assuming we are not together.

And it's natural to feel negative emotions about it. You seem to understand and agree with the mission of the organization so you can't be too surprised by their rules. It's less about you and more creating an intentional experience for the people going on the trip. That is okay. Your relationship isn't being singled out. Especially because this isn't a couple trip, they are rejecting you as a white person, not your girlfriend. You aren't an asshole, but you should take a look at the dissonance between your feelings of rejection and the acknowledgment that you believe it's important to have these spaces for BIPOC.", "I might be in the minority (I mean I already am so who cares)\n\nYTA- Just because you're white doesn't mean you need to be included in everything, especially things for BIPOC.

I'm not creating this post to stir up controversy or out of any bad intentions, it's an honest question that I'm having that I could use some insight and reflections on!\n\nEssentially, my girlfriend (23F) wanted to take me(22M) on a camping trip in a month that is put together by a group called BIPOC Outdoors, which searches to provide BIPOC people with experiences and support to do outdoor activities such as camping, fishing, skiing, etc. The belief and mission is basically that outdoor activities have primarily become seen as \"white people\" activities and not everyone has the money and means to be able to engage in these activities, so the group helps to remedy that perception. Therefore, the group is obviously targeted to BIPOC people, which I completely understand and think is a great thing.\n\nMy girlfriend really wanted to go on a camping trip put together by this group in about a month, and I said I would love to do it. A bit of necessary information: my girlfriend was born here in the US to Mexican parents, and I am White. When she went to the webpage to sign us up, the website stated that spouses/partners who are White are not welcome to join. My girlfriend did not want to go without me, and therefore we are not going on the camping trip. She was annoyed and upset by it and said she didn't think it was right, and while at first I sort of brushed it off, it really started to irk and hurt me. I went to high school at an international school, and virtually all of my friends were not people of my ethnicity. When I worked at McDonald's in high school, there were a few workers from Mexico who did not speak English, and so I came to be their translators and one even told me I was his only \"American\" friend. My girlfriend's parents don't speak English, which works well since I speak Spanish fluently, which has allowed for me to get to know both Mexican and specifically Oaxacan culture much better. Because of this, many times I've found myself being the only \"gringo\" in a room, speaking a language that I've learned, and finding beauty in the ability to learn and connect with others. I'm not saying all this to show I've \"proved myself,\" but more to say that I've always lived my life in a way that is open and loving to others, and willing to place myself out of my comfort zone so that people feel a place of love and support, which is why it sort of hurts to find myself in this position. Additionally, I feel as if our interracial relationship wasn't respected and sort of singled out. If I had been any other skin tone, this wouldn't have been an issue, and I also feel bad because I know my girlfriend was really looking forward to the trip.\n\nSo AITA for feeling hurt by this ordeal?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Neo-segregationists are racist fucks. It was wrong when Jim Crow motherfuckers did it and it's still wrong when BIPOCs are trying to revive it.

The people running this group are no different than the inbred AHs that poured condiments and sugar on the heads of sit-in protestors or yelled abuse at Ruby Bridges for invading their whites only space.\n\nThe idea that they're specifically excluding spouses and partners tells me these people likely have some backwards views on racial miscegenation because they don't view those marriages/partnerships as equal to relationships between BIPOCs.\n\nIn short, consider yourself lucky to not go spending time with a bunch of close-minded bigots who believe your relationship and personhood aren't valid.\n\nAnd to anyone trying to claim they're not racist because of that self-defeating, inane definition of racism that racism equals prejudice and power, the segregationists here have both the prejudice and the power.

Thank you for summing up your experience so well and relating it to the issue I brought up. I really appreciate your insight and the effort that went into sharing your thoughts.

You obviously come from a place of empathy and much grace. I'm sure you raised three absolutely wonderful young adults. We have been together for around 2 1/2 years now, and I think this is honestly the first negative experience we've had as an interracial couple, which is honestly probably a good stroke of luck since it is not the worst ordeal in the world by any stretch of the imagination. It's nice to have each other's back, and to love each other fully both of us! We have a young 1-year-old daughter and she brings so much happiness to us, and she has brought us closer as well. Some of the accusations on this thread seem to be accusing me of inviting myself into a space that isn't for me, which I think is much different than accompanying my girlfriend who wanted me there to support her. Some may still think the latter is still wrong, but I think it's a pretty significant distinction. Anyways, much love to you and your family!", "I love that last line.

They weren\u2019t allowed in a lot of national parks , were segregated to smaller areas and not allowed to do certain activities. Because of this a large amount of BIPOC people do not know how to do theses activities or are actually scared of the outdoors ( like how the rumor that black people don\u2019t swim because they were banned from swimming pools). I understand that it\u2019s not great feeling excluded but the purpose of the organization seems geared towards correcting this historically injustice and also to support BIPOC people who are not yet comfortable in that space. Likely the funding to do so is targeted towards BIPOC people and they want to ensure every one who benefits is a POC.

Safe spaces are exclusionary to give us places to relax and breathe, without having to face microaggressions, or ignorance of any degree. To go camping with people who *truly* understand. Nobody there knows you. Nobody knows how well you understand POC experiences . What they do know is that you have never lived through them, which again leaves the risk of you saying or doing something that makes people uncomfortable or unsafe.", "It did come across on the edge of that, not overtly so, that's why I still said NAH.   As a white person, us explaining our background and how we are understanding and acceping of others and have friends that are BIPOC or others does not change the fact that we are white. And if a space is not for us because of that, it is not against us, it is just a safe space for them. Because its not against us, it does not require that information to \"defend\" ourselves from assumptions of being racist or not understanding.   By doing that it comes off as trying to justify something.", "Thank you! Sometimes it\u2019s posts like yours that help us realize how blessed we truly are. Gives us that moment to step back and look at what we built. Remember that when you are also in the daily grind. Each day in your relationship will be different than most. \u201cTypical\u201d, at least from a racial point of view, will not apply to your family.\n\nI understand the distinction you are making. Here you are, demonstrating to the world what it truly means to accept anyone by attempting to support your GF, and an organization that professes to do the same, chooses not to support you in your endeavor. Again, your feelings are valid and that doesn\u2019t make you an AH. This is where you remind yourself that you\u2019re already demonstrating to the world what it means to be accepting. \n\nOne of the critical concepts here is that underrepresented groups tend to find strength in numbers. Your daughter won\u2019t have those numbers. That\u2019s why we found it really important to live life as a united family. Our children will rarely find someone who can relate, but they have each other. The \u201cstrength in numbers\u201d will not likely be there in their lifetime unless orgs like this one realize the necessity of taking the next step toward inclusivity.\n\nMuch love to you as well and enjoy every moment of that little girl!

I hope you and your gf can plan your own camping trip - it probably can be more intimate than going with a bunch of strangers so maybe it\u2019s a win for you both.", "You\u2019re proud of going out of your comfort zone because you could have chosen to stay comfortable.\n\nHaving the choice is the privilege.\n\nMost BIPOC people don\u2019t have the choice to stay comfortable.", "Segregation isn't the answer to segregation.", "I personally feel there is little true change to be had by telling ourselves that we *shouldn\u2019t* feel something we feel. (That rarely works on me, anyway.) It seems always destined to be an uphill battle and just encourages us to repress. Instead, I favor considering whether my feeling is ideally directed. People have done this for me numerous times and I\u2019ve gotten so much out of it. \n\nAnyway, good job fellow human being awesome!", " \"When she went to the webpage to sign us up, the website stated that spouses/partners who are White are not welcome to join\"  \nYour exact words in your post.\n\nYou can stick up for her all you want, But she was 100% in the wrong. Its in the sign up page, So therefore she'd see it either way.", "But you wrote\n\"When she went to the webpage to sign us up, the website stated that spouses/partners who are White are not welcome to join.\"\n\nSo it was spelled out on the website?", "Black people can't be racist remember?", "\ud83d\ude18 Best wishes to you and your family! Thank you for the gift of reflection today. Hubby and I are sitting here reading and re-reading.", "There's a difference between the general webpage of the site, and the site where you sign up. It's like the difference between Amazon's webpage and the \"purchase page.\"", "I clarified this above. She had previously looked at the general webpage of the group, but it wasn't until the actual sign-up page that the policy excluding white partners was spelled out. Again, the difference between the general webpage and the \"confirm your purchase\" webpage.", "But it was still there, and she still saw it before the trip. Correct?", "You did not clarify that up above. The sign up page IS part of the website!", "If I'm being honest, I'm not understanding this argument. The general page was obviously geared to BIPOC, but the more specific page where you put down your info to sign up (sort of like the confirm your purchase page) stated that white spouses/partners were not allowed. My girlfriend didn't see the sign-up page until we were ready to commit, which is when we found out we couldn't commit! It's not like we booked it and had to cancel. We just didn't sign up when we saw the policy.", "I\u2019m a pedant and this distinction seems excessive to me.", ">I'm not understanding this argument. \n\nPeople in this sub are just assholes...  \n\n\nYou're not an asshole. Fuck the group for not being inclusive. Fuck people that want inclusivity, but exclude people.", "Not trying to argue, Sorry if it comes out that way just hard to get the entirety of the issue sometimes. And it seems like i completely missed the part where you said you didn't even go on the trip - So that's my fault.", "First it wasn't in the site.\n\nThen, the main page, geared toward BIPOC, didn't but the sign up page did. Which is correct? \n\nWas it on the front/main page or not? Was it on the registration page, where you'd see it before you registered or not?", "&#x200B;\n\nI mean, I litterally said NAH - no asshole here -\n\nHe's not an asshole for being hurt by it, and they're technically not assholes for wanting to not include people from their group. Is it kinda shitty? Sure, but it's a group centered around opening up activities for people of color that normally would not think to do those activities.", "You're totally good! I figured there was a misunderstanding somewhere! It was a longer post too so easy for things to be missed. Either way, I really appreciate you engaging! I'm a pretty open-minded person and really need to hear other opinions, and I'm grateful for people taking the time to share them.", "Lmao I'm not going into this again. I've explained this in-depth in multiple comments above. Sorry to be rude but I've done absolutely all the clarifying I'm humanly capable of.."]}
