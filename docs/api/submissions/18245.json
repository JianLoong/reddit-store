I am currently pregnant with baby #5 and we had a small gender reveal party last weekend where we found out we are having a girl. My husband has 3 children with his ex-wife 2 sons and a daughter. So, although this baby will be my first girl, it is not my husbands. All the kids, including my stepdaughter, were super happy to find out the baby is going to be a girl. She has wanted all my babies to be girls and finally at 17 she is going to have a little sister.\n\nYesterday I posted on my Instagram photos from the gender reveal and in my caption, I commented about how excited I am to have my first girl.\n\nA few hours later my stepchildren's mom DM'd me a long paragraph in which she called me insensitive and rude for acting like this baby was mine and my husband's first girl when he already has a daughter. I replied to her and told her I know it's not his first daughter, but it is mine and it is still a new experience for me. She counted that myself and my husband were side lining her daughter for this new baby girl. I didn't reply to her after that.\n\nI brought up the messages to my husband and although he took my side, he also noted that I did to some extent already have a daughter and that he understands where his ex is coming from. Someone else also commented on my post telling me it wasn't really my first girl.\n\nI love my stepchildren and I have a great relationship with my stepdaughter. My stepdaughter and I have a great bond and spend a lot of time together and I don't see that changing with a new baby. However, I didn't raise her, I met her when she was already 7, and she is only with us 50% of the time. I could understand if their mom was upset I said our first girl but I didn't, because I acknowledge that my husband has already raised a girl, whereas I have been an important part of that girls life but not her mother.

Which might explain why her bio mom contacted you as she saw her daughter hurt.\n\nEnd of the day you\u2019re a parent and/or parental figure to ALL the kids in your family and it\u2019s not about your feelings, but protecting theirs and making them all feel loved and included. \n\nGiven the dynamics and your bond with your step daughter, this would be equivalent to if she was an adopted daughter and you made that post.

It's a whole different experience (from my experience) raising boys vs girls, especially  a whole slew of boys. You are allowed to be excited.\n\nWhat I would do though is have a conversation with your stepdaughter and see how she's feeling and if her feelings were hurt. If they were then this is a great opportunity for you to communicate with her and express how you feel about her and how important she is to you and explain your own feelings. Let her know that this baby girl won't mean she's cast aside. If she's not hurt and just excited then all's well. Don't worry about her mom.

You could have easily just said you were happy to welcome another girl into the family.", "NAH. I will say from a siblings perspective, my mom had my sister before she met my dad and had me. I was called the \"first born\" even though I had an older sister. Comments like that are a huge reason why I distance myself from that side of the family. I'd say be mindful of what you say in front of your daughter in the future. When my family calls my sister my \"half sister\" \n, \"not blood\", etc I correct them. If my dad viewed my sister the way you view uour daughter I would absolutely think less of him and distance. I started distancing in elementary school.", "NTA.\n\nPeople are weird about step parents on Reddit. IMO, as a mother and a step mother, my children are mine and my step children, while I love them to pieces, are not mine. \n\nMy first child might not have been my husband's first child, but I should be allowed to celebrate that. \n\nAs an aside - as a step parent you often get all of the shit and none of the sugar. Just like parents make mistakes sometimes and they're forgiven, it seems that step parents are not allowed this leeway and need to do everything right, every time, first time, even if they don't have a child of their own on whom they have already had practice.", "NTA. I get why some people don\u2019t want to date people with kids because you can\u2019t even enjoy having your own kids and your own experience without people nitpicking and trying to police your feelings and experience. \n\nNobody demands that kids see their step-parents as equivalent to their bio-parents but then want to move the goalposts and demand the opposite of step-parents. \n\nThis is your first girl.

Like it wouldn't kill you to acknowledge his role in your current oh so wonderful life and consider him part of your family.\"  This feels like that.\n\nIs it technically true?  Sure, and that would be fine if life was purely technical, but it's not.  Because life is nuanced and messy and people have feelings.  It feels kind of crass to emphasize only the genitalia of the baby coming out of your own genitalia without acknowledging the (step) daughter already in your life.", "I say NTA- but maybe ask your step daughter how she feels. Did she take your post any kind of way or was she unbothered? I say if she doesn\u2019t care then neither should you.", "This one is kinda tough, but I think I'll go with NTA.\n\nYou didn't say anything that wasn't technically true. Biologically, this *is* your first daughter. However, saying that while also being the stepmother of a girl you've known for 10 years could be upsetting.\n\nWhile I don't think you meant any harm by saying so, it does come across as insensitive.", "Yta, what you have written may technically be true but your stepdaughter is quite obviously going to be hurt by you saying you don't consider her your daughter. I get the excitement but yay finally another girl in the house may have been a better way of expressing it without hurting a kids feelings.", "YTA.  Those words are hurtful.

You're not TA for feeling the way you do - YTA for making a public declaration that you do not consider your step children equal to your biological children.", "YTA. \n\nNot for your feelings, because they are valid and real. But to put it somewhere publicly where your stepdaughter can see it is an AH move. She was likely really hurt by those words and it may damage your relationship with her.

I also grew up a stepchild, and never considered myself to be the daughter of either of my stepparents. They were just people that my parents loved and chose, not me.

I think the way your husband explained it to you was spot on, I'm sure he knows how much you care for your stepdaughter and that you didn't mean to slight her.

They were more concerned about the impact of my child\u2019s birth on my stepdaughter, who was 6 years old by this time. They were worried about her going from being an only child to having a sibling. They even asked me to reschedule my c-section, which my dr. scheduled because I was 2 weeks past my due date, because it was my stepdaughter\u2019s first day of first grade. Although she\u2019d attended preschool and kindergarten, and it was unsafe for me and my baby to continue carrying him, they were more concerned about taking attention away from her first day. And if I ever said anything about having my first baby or being a first-time mom, they\u2019d correct me. When I framed and displayed an ultrasound picture, they said it was mean because I didn\u2019t also have an ultrasound of my stepdaughter. I found the whole situation very hurtful. It felt as if I couldn\u2019t celebrate what was a momentous occasion for me without being accused of or judged for being inconsiderate of my stepdaughter\u2019s feelings. I say all this to say I understand why you made the post, and no one should judge you for making it. For all those saying you are her mom, I wonder if they\u2019d call your SD an a-hole if she made a Mother\u2019s Day post only acknowledging her mother or what they\u2019d call you if you asked her to call you mom. I bet their logic would change. So, please ignore them.", "How do you know it doesn\u2019t apply?", "It all depends on your relationship with your step daughter and either the ex picked up on her daughter being upset or she was just looking for drama. Based on your comments, it seems obvious to me that you don\u2019t see your step-daughter as your daughter (and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that-I don\u2019t see any of the step-* as anything except step-*). Perhaps speak with your step-daughter and let her know that you love her and value her, but are excited to have a baby girl.  I think she will understand.", "Edit. Nm op ... you did nothing wrong your word choice is fine and unless step daughter says anything just let this go. Also dont change a thing after reading the responces of a bunch of adults who think only one person matters I'm done. No the 17 yr old doesnt get to invalidate the life experience of op nor does the husbands ex, nor does the husband. This is absolutely your first baby girl. You get to enjoy that. If and only if your step daughter says something about it hurting her do you need to decide what part of your experience your willing to let go of.\n\nNTA you clearly said my first girl, after 3 other pregnancies and births, I would only change if you talk with your step daughter and she says it hurts her feelings. Then maybe have a heart to heart about how she is alway your first daughter and that she will always be special to you. And maybe edit the post or update it with \"correction my first baby girl as my daughter of the heart came to me at age 7 and 7 is not a baby.\" Truthfully it sounds as if the mother of your step daughter has issues not the step daughter. So not the ah. Unless your step sons got the same upset when you had your boys..", "NTA. Pretty sure the 17 yr old knows you didn't \"have her\". \n\nAlso pretty sure the 17 yr old knows how excited you are, as she is also. \n\nI'd ignore the EX, and start planning Mommy/Sisters stuff with the 17 yr old, see what she wants to do first with her little sister.", "What a horrible woman. \n\nYou must be super excited to finally have your own little girl. \n\nIt is totally different being your own child - of course it is! especially since ex wife is still around. \n\nSo so happy for you. \n\nAnd you did say 'my' in the post. \n\nMaybe she's jealous or something. \n\nAnd its awesome that stepdaughter is over the moon too. \n\nHuge congratulations! \n\nNTA AT ALL.", "Older siblings are used as free child care, for one. \n\nImo, whether you can afford it or not, no one should be having that many kids. It is ridiculous.", "RIGHT?! Cause when she said she was on her 5th I was like \u201cdamn. That\u2019s expensive af\u201d", "\u201cFirst baby girl\u201d would have been so much better.  Or, you know, not focusing on gender because how they come out may not be how they grow up.", "This! 7-17 are crucial years. I could see her getting her feelings hurt. And although op is correct and not exactly an asshole, step daughter isn\u2019t wrong for Being hurt over it.", "Yee, I agree. Can you change the post to, \"My first baby girl?\" And kudos to your hubby's ex, who values your relationship with her daughter!", "Yeah I don't think you're an asshole for what you did but I think you should clarify what you meant to your stepdaughter and make it clear that you do see her as your child as well. They're also not assholes for being upset. NAH ultimately", "Ya but OP is still her step daughters second mom. It's just the truth.", "I feel like OP is avoiding answering that\u2026", "I\u2019m the older sibling I\u2019m this situation in my family and my younger siblings and surprisingly all my cousins don\u2019t really vibe with the family members that wanted to point me out as \u201cnot really related\u201d to that side of the family.", "I'm sorry. I totally understand how that must be really hurtful. When I read this, I thought the same thing. I'm mid-30s and would be hurt as well. Sending hugs your way.\n\nIt's completely unnecessary for people in these situations to post stuff like this to social media. And in this situation like...why is it so important to not only post that but then come here to try to ask if she's in the right, rather than considering her stepdaughter's feelings?\n\nI'm not even going with soft AH. I'm going solid YTA. Bc OP has had it pointed out to her by the mother that this might be hurtful. And not only did she not mention concern for the stepdaughter's feelings in her post, but she hasn't responded to all the questions in the comments about how the stepdaughter feels. She just seems more concerned with what she posts online than with how her stepdaughter feels. \n\nIt's hurtful enough to post without thinking about how it might make someone feel. But she's had it pointed out and still isn't focusing on what should be important (real feelings rather than insta likes/congrats or randos opinions).", "Naw. This is a great way to put your husband (and yourself) in a crappy position if ex-wife decides to take them to court if any of the steps are minors because you wanted to get snarky back. She already feels you insulted her child (and maybe the kid does too) and that\u2019s not going to play well to judges especially since you don\u2019t know what grievances the kids might have.", "But it does literally mean she doesn't see her step daughter as her kid", "I mean\u2026 I personally think it\u2019d be weirder to announce it like \u201cMy first and only baby girl!\u201d Some of you all are nitpicking. She\u2019s just excited to be pregnant and carrying a girl for the first time.", "Yeah.  But I'm going with a gentle:\n\nYTA.  **Stop posting to Reddit**, delete your Instagram post, **put down the phone**, and use this opportunity to have a friendly conversation with your step-daughter.", "100% this.", "Ah this possibly happened to my FIL. His dad, a widower with a son (him, FIL) married a widow with a daughter. He and stepsister were raised closely and adore each other despite a big age gap. Then dad and mom had a son together, and stepmom suddenly didn\u2019t really have a need for her stepson anymore. This is my sister in law\u2019s theory.\nMy father-in-law still refers to her as his mom, but it doesn\u2019t seem mutual. Fortunately stepsister never changed her treatment of him and they are very close.\n\nThe kicker is, the full bio son ended up being a massive asshole disowned by his own kids.", "If it was option one I have no doubt OP would have mentioned it.", "If the mom reached out to her and dad kinda agreed, then daughter probably was hurt and told one of them about it.", "But even after the mom pointed out the fact this might be hurtful (and people are asking), OP still doesn't seem to be thinking about how the stepdaughter may have perceived the post. She's just jumping right back on the internet rather than figuring out if the girl is hurt. And since the stepdaughter might not want to dampen OPs excitement or might be embarrassed for feeling hurt, OP really just ought to be offline, reassuring her stepdaughter.", "OP says she posted it on her Insta, and that bio mom called and complained about it. The post does not specifically say stepdaughter saw it and/or heard it and was upset about it directly. There\u2019s a lot of comments though, so idk if OP clarified the details later on.\n\nIt sounds to me like bio mom is fussing about it because she\u2019s concerned about her daughter. And even unpopular opinions can have more than one person in agreement. I\u2019m curious to know what other people have said about her instagram post at this point.", "The OP doesn't seem to have reached out to the stepdaughter to find out how she feels, so YTA.", "Does it really matter for ONE Facebook post though?", "Why do people block you after they make statements? Seems counterintuitive.", "Yes exactly! No one is saying she can\u2019t be excited about have a bio baby girl, but it\u2019s harsh to put it on social media for her step daughter and the world to see. I would be hurt too, all she had to do was take out \u201cfirst\u201d and all would have been good. Like why put \u201cfirst\u201d in there anyway when she has many kids? Also if I saw a post like that with the word \u201cfirst\u201d knowing OP had a step daughter she was close to, I would literally cringe. I guarantee people who saw that were uncomfortable", "Shout out to another first kid parentified by 8! You are not alone!", "Children dictate the emotional needs of the relationship, since you\u2019re so pedantic.", "Exactly! My dad is remarried and my mom was in a serious relationship for years, I met my stepmom when I was 15/16 and my \u201cstepdad\u201d when I was 17. Neither of my step parents were an actual parental figure, but they still put effort into \u201cbeing a family\u201d because I\u2019m their SO\u2019s child. My step dad and mom have been separated for a couple years now but he still sends birthday/holiday texts and I see him occasionally when my brother and I hang out with our former step siblings. My mom doesn\u2019t mind and it feels good to know that he still thinks about us even if it\u2019s not the same relationship as before. \n\nYou don\u2019t need to be a parent to your step children, but if you\u2019re gonna marry someone with kids, you should be willing to welcome their kids into the family (within reason ofc).", "because it's literally her first time birthing a girl. this is a time to congratulate momma on her pregnancy and being happy to birth a bouncing baby girl and yall worried about technicalities? way to make it about yourself bruh smh", "Same. My stepfather came into my life when i was 2. He's basically the only man in my life who I remember as a father figure. But just like you, I call him by his first name and I never saw myself as his daughter. My brother is his son, I'm his stepdaughter and I would never be offended if he were to say something like OP said in the story.", "Cool. We don\u2019t know.", "I'm so sorry you went through that hell, too!", "The stepdaughter has her birth Mom, And she told the OP that the OP was, \"sidelining her daughter (the stepdaughter) That doesn't seem to be the case.

And when she does so without consideration for the feelings of a child she has been raising for 10 years, she is an asshole. YTA, not because she feels like her unborn child is her first daughter, but because she seems inconsiderate of her stepdaughter feelings. Even after it was pointed out to her that it might have been hurtful, she seems more concerned about being right. The first thing a kind person would de was make sure the stepdaughter wasn't hurt and reassure her, not debate how right she is.", "I agree, bio mom should stay out. That said, now that OP is aware of a potential situation she should check in with SD and see whether she is hurt. If so she can address it and discuss how to talk about future hurts.", "INFO how does your stepdaughter feel about this, I would ask her opinion and go with that. If she's upset by it, Y T A.
