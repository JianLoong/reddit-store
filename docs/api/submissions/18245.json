I am currently pregnant with baby #5 and we had a small gender reveal party last weekend where we found out we are having a girl. My husband has 3 children with his ex-wife 2 sons and a daughter. So, although this baby will be my first girl, it is not my husbands. All the kids, including my stepdaughter, were super happy to find out the baby is going to be a girl. She has wanted all my babies to be girls and finally at 17 she is going to have a little sister.\n\nYesterday I posted on my Instagram photos from the gender reveal and in my caption, I commented about how excited I am to have my first girl.\n\nA few hours later my stepchildren's mom DM'd me a long paragraph in which she called me insensitive and rude for acting like this baby was mine and my husband's first girl when he already has a daughter. I replied to her and told her I know it's not his first daughter, but it is mine and it is still a new experience for me. She counted that myself and my husband were side lining her daughter for this new baby girl. I didn't reply to her after that.\n\nI brought up the messages to my husband and although he took my side, he also noted that I did to some extent already have a daughter and that he understands where his ex is coming from. Someone else also commented on my post telling me it wasn't really my first girl.\n\nI love my stepchildren and I have a great relationship with my stepdaughter. My stepdaughter and I have a great bond and spend a lot of time together and I don't see that changing with a new baby. However, I didn't raise her, I met her when she was already 7, and she is only with us 50% of the time. I could understand if their mom was upset I said our first girl but I didn't, because I acknowledge that my husband has already raised a girl, whereas I have been an important part of that girls life but not her mother.

Which might explain why her bio mom contacted you as she saw her daughter hurt.\n\nEnd of the day you\u2019re a parent and/or parental figure to ALL the kids in your family and it\u2019s not about your feelings, but protecting theirs and making them all feel loved and included. \n\nGiven the dynamics and your bond with your step daughter, this would be equivalent to if she was an adopted daughter and you made that post.

It's a whole different experience (from my experience) raising boys vs girls, especially  a whole slew of boys. You are allowed to be excited.\n\nWhat I would do though is have a conversation with your stepdaughter and see how she's feeling and if her feelings were hurt. If they were then this is a great opportunity for you to communicate with her and express how you feel about her and how important she is to you and explain your own feelings. Let her know that this baby girl won't mean she's cast aside. If she's not hurt and just excited then all's well. Don't worry about her mom.

You could have easily just said you were happy to welcome another girl into the family.", "NAH. I will say from a siblings perspective, my mom had my sister before she met my dad and had me. I was called the \"first born\" even though I had an older sister. Comments like that are a huge reason why I distance myself from that side of the family. I'd say be mindful of what you say in front of your daughter in the future. When my family calls my sister my \"half sister\" \n, \"not blood\", etc I correct them. If my dad viewed my sister the way you view uour daughter I would absolutely think less of him and distance. I started distancing in elementary school.", "NTA.\n\nPeople are weird about step parents on Reddit. IMO, as a mother and a step mother, my children are mine and my step children, while I love them to pieces, are not mine. \n\nMy first child might not have been my husband's first child, but I should be allowed to celebrate that. \n\nAs an aside - as a step parent you often get all of the shit and none of the sugar. Just like parents make mistakes sometimes and they're forgiven, it seems that step parents are not allowed this leeway and need to do everything right, every time, first time, even if they don't have a child of their own on whom they have already had practice.", "NTA. I get why some people don\u2019t want to date people with kids because you can\u2019t even enjoy having your own kids and your own experience without people nitpicking and trying to police your feelings and experience. \n\nNobody demands that kids see their step-parents as equivalent to their bio-parents but then want to move the goalposts and demand the opposite of step-parents. \n\nThis is your first girl.

Like it wouldn't kill you to acknowledge his role in your current oh so wonderful life and consider him part of your family.\"  This feels like that.\n\nIs it technically true?  Sure, and that would be fine if life was purely technical, but it's not.  Because life is nuanced and messy and people have feelings.  It feels kind of crass to emphasize only the genitalia of the baby coming out of your own genitalia without acknowledging the (step) daughter already in your life.", "I say NTA- but maybe ask your step daughter how she feels. Did she take your post any kind of way or was she unbothered? I say if she doesn\u2019t care then neither should you.", "This one is kinda tough, but I think I'll go with NTA.\n\nYou didn't say anything that wasn't true. Biologically, this *is* your first daughter. However, saying that while also being the stepmother of a girl you've known for 10 years could be upsetting.\n\nWhile I don't think you meant any harm by saying so, it does come across as insensitive.", "Yta, what you have written may technically be true but your stepdaughter is quite obviously going to be hurt by you saying you don't consider her your daughter. I get the excitement but yay finally another girl in the house may have been a better way of expressing it without hurting a kids feelings.", "YTA.  Those words are hurtful.

You're not TA for feeling the way you do - YTA for making a public declaration that you do not consider your step children equal to your biological children.", "YTA. \n\nNot for your feelings, because they are valid and real. But to put it somewhere publicly where your stepdaughter can see it is an AH move. She was likely really hurt by those words and it may damage your relationship with her.

I also grew up a stepchild, and never considered myself to be the daughter of either of my stepparents. They were just people that my parents loved and chose, not me.

This shit is crazy to my 49-year-old ass. Lol", "Real daughter doesn\u2019t have to mean biological, I have step siblings who absolutely are my REAL siblings. Such a sad attitude about family", "A step-daughter who\u2019s viewed the OP in a parental role since she was seven isn\u2019t her \u201creal\u201d daughter and the OP doesn\u2019t \u201chave to pretend that she is\u201d? That\u2019s cold. Just because she didn\u2019t give birth to her, herself, doesn\u2019t mean her step-daughter isn\u2019t her daughter.", "You think someone who\u2019s been in the life of a child for ten years has no input, even part-time? Lol. That is definitely not true in any healthy family situation.", "They've known each other a long time though. Step daughter might think of them as only tied by marriage or she may see her as a parental figure. Both types of relationships exist in the world.", "It doesn't really matter what the intent was, it seems like the impact was hurtful.", "Yes but it doesn\u2019t matter - stepdaughter can still see it.", "that\u2019s still five years worth of time. that\u2019s a long time to parent a kid without thinking of them as your kid.", "As a stepchild, who is 10 years older than her first younger sister. And absolutely loves her stepmom, I know their relationship is different to ours.", "Stepdaughter is 17 now, she was 7 when OP first met her/came into her life.", "The stepdaughter is 17, not 7", "The stepdaughter is 17 years old", "But saying first BABY girl would be OK, because SD didn't come into her life until was 7.", "Viewed her in a parental role but does she view her as mom? I suspect that she makes a distinction between her mom and her stepmom. \n\nI would also imagine that her mom makes that distinction as well. If daughter was calling her stepmom \u201cmom\u201d and pretending their was no difference between the two of them she\u2019d probably be pissed.", "Yes, it does. It really actually by definition does. Do you think this kid will ever prioritize OPs needs or wants or feelings or loyalty over her own mother's?? Doubt. On mother's day is OP the first card or the second (if she gets one at all)? \n\nIt's ok. We don't have to pretend or make shit into something it's not here. You may be lucky enough to experience a lot of love but you only get one mother, good bad or otherwise.\n\nIt does mean they have a wonderful step relationship that may have been alienated and should be addressed? Sure, and OP should do so but yeah, its not cold to be a realist about how you fit into a complex puzzle and respecting that as opposed to trying to force your way into a title that doesn't belong to you lol.", "I totally disagree on this, I'd consider it a huge overstep on my part to try and influence things like school choice or vaccination status and health decisions, discipline decisions beyond requiring respect in my home or the financial management side with my step kid. That's just not my lane and although I don't always agree with it its not my place to tell other people how to raise their kid.", "Do you think that she considers OP her mom?", "That\u2019s bunk. It\u2019s not a contest and you sort of sound really bitter. I\u2019m sorry if that stems from a bad personal experience as a step-parent.\n\nWe live in a different world now where kids can have more than just the traditional biological husband and wife as parents. There are bonus moms and dads, adoptive parents, guardians, fosters, etc. \n\nOP was thoughtless at best in wording things as she did. She basically communicated to her step-daughter that she doesn\u2019t consider her as her actual daughter. We don\u2019t know whether or not that mindset was the same as her step-daughters. That should have been a consideration.", "It's not your job to tell someone how to raise their kids but if you have two sets of rules - your kids and our kids - you are not a family and kids with stricter rules can't understand how it's not unfair.  Those families usually don't last."]}
