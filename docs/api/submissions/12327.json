I really like this guy and it's my first proper relationship as I have always been a bit too busy with work for a relationship but I really wanna put in the effort and enjoy myself and overcome my anxieties. Yesterday I told my sister(25F) that I plan on going with this guy to a restaurant that she has been wanting to try out and basically said \"Oh hey I can try it out with my date and then you and I can go together if it's good\" and that's when she got upset with me. She looked visibly hurt and I feel terrible. She asked if I even thought about bringing her too on this date so she can also get to know the guy and I told her I did but thought for a third date it might be too early for them to get to know each other. I also want to get to know this guy with it just being us alone. She hasn't really talked to me since that and is acting very cold toward me. I tried to ask her if she wants to be the one I take first and she blew up on me saying that I m in the wrong for not wanting it to be the three of us on this date cause she just wants to get to know him as well...so it seems like it's not about the restaurant and more of I didn't want to go with her and this has me confused.\n\nI feel very conflicted because on one hand I want to be alone with my date and on the other hand I don't want my sister to be upset with me, she has also been having a difficult time at work so it's been difficult because I can't even really be excited around her about this new relationship, I noticed in the beginning when I do this I was getting one word answers or short answers from her so I dialed it down. I know it's not her fault that she is stressed and I obviously wouldn't want her to pretend to be in a great mood just cause I m in a new relationship, so I understand.\n\nI have considered just folding and asking her if she will go with me but I also really don't want to so maybe I really am just being an asshole.\n\nAm  I the asshole here for not wanting her to go with me?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT - I feel a lot less conflicted about the situation now. I 100% will not be taking her on this date or any for that matter and I also probably need to set some boundaries in my relationship with my sister because I even considered taking her and I can see it is not a normal thing now. Thank you to everyone who took the time to respond, I feel a lot better now .\n\nSome more background:\n\n1. She is single, has been since she finished University, so perhaps it's a factor\n2. She met the guy briefly when he picked me up for the first date\n3. When she was dating I never asked to join or be invited to a date so her reaction has caught me by surprise", "created_utc": 1678854856, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11rm547/aita_for_not_taking_my_sister_with_me_on_my_third/", "score": 271, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The time to introduce the two of them is a bit later on, and probably not on the date itself.  What differentiates a date from a hang out is the romantic aspect of it and having a friend or family member in tow detracts from that.  A lot.\n\nHowever, where you are at fault is wanting to go with your date to a restaurant that your sister previously told you she wants to try!  Be more considerate to your sister and choose another restaurant.  Come on now, that's really cold hearted.

You have been put in a position where you are constantly worrying about her every feeling and being scared of her reaction. You are not responsible for anything she is putting on you. Fuck her feelings. They are her problem. This is all very weird. Seems like enmeshment. You and your sister do not have healthy boundaries and you are punished with guilt when you try to set them. Don\u2019t chase her. Don\u2019t fawn after her cause she got told no and is having a tantrum. You are going on a date. There is no discussion that needs to be had. \u201cI don\u2019t want you there\u201d is a good enough reason even if the date thing wasn\u2019t happening.

It's not fair to create a situation where they are expected to pay for you and an unexpected Plus 1.   \n\nThat said, it's not unreasonable for your sister to want to meet your date.  But the way to do that is somewhere casual - your house, his, a coffee shop - where you can meet up, each get your own coffee etc.  and sit for half an hour or so.  Dates are not for third wheels.

He sometimes will ask to go on us with dates that we planned to be just us, but we\u2019ve set boundaries and say no then just make a point to invite him to other dates that we are more comfortable having him come with. But on a third date??? That\u2019s just wack dude, don\u2019t let your sister third wheel that early", "Please do NOT take her on a DATE with you.  It's a date, not a friend outing.  AND it's ONLY the 3RD date.  I doubt the guy would be happy if she tagged along.  Especially since you're still getting to know eachother & the 3rd date is usually when things get romantic.  Usually at this point you're deciding whether or not to continue seeing eachother.   When you've been seeing eachother for a few weeks, maybe then she can tag along.  Your sis is out of line & has no business asking to tag along on a freaking DATE!!!!  This really burns me.  It's a DATE!!!!!!!", "\"Your sister sounds jealous.\"\nMy first thought, too. Suspect that sis wants to \"get to know the guy\" then scrape OP off and steal him for herself.\n\nOP, better go to a different restaurant because sis will definitely \"accidentally\" show up and invite herself to your table.", "> She met the guy briefly when he picked me up for the first date\n\nI think you are correct.", "Yes, do stand up for yourself. Also, in future, be sure to separate in your mind that someone being upset with you means that you did something wrong. They are two different things. NTA", "It feels weird because it IS weird!", "I doubt if the restaurant has anything to do with it - I bet she also wants to be with your date, otherwise she would have taken you up on the offer to go with her without your date.", "Because it seems likely I'm gonna be honest with you her wanting to come isn't because she wants to go to the restaurant it's that she prob wants to steal that guy from you cause why else would she get angry that you don't wanna bring her she's tryna 3rd wheel don't let her and I'd also suggest just booking a dif restaurant as you never know if she's just gonna show up unannounced", "This is a very important life lesson."]}
