She asked if I even thought about bringing her too on this date so she can also get to know the guy and I told her I did but thought for a third date it might be too early for them to get to know each other. I also want to get to know this guy with it just being us alone. She hasn't really talked to me since that and is acting very cold toward me. I tried to ask her if she wants to be the one I take first and she blew up on me saying that I m in the wrong for not wanting it to be the three of us on this date cause she just wants to get to know him as well...so it seems like it's not about the restaurant and more of I didn't want to go with her and this has me confused.\n\nI feel very conflicted because on one hand I want to be alone with my date and on the other hand I don't want my sister to be upset with me, she has also been having a difficult time at work so it's been difficult because I can't even really be excited around her about this new relationship, I noticed in the beginning when I do this I was getting one word answers or short answers from her so I dialed it down.

Third wheeling a dinner date is not the correct situation for them to meet and it's too soon anyway.", "NTA, how do you want to get to know your date further when you have your sister breathing down your necks? 3rd date is too soon to meet family members. Awkward if you did bring her.", "NTA. \nYour sister could probably benefit from some therapy, she seems to be very sheltered. You are an adult and living your own life. You\u2019re not obligated to bring other people. This guy you\u2019re getting to know will probably be irritated to have a third wheel. You have absolutely nothing to feel guilty about.

It's not a double date and a third date is a bit too early to start introducing family members. Should be more about getting to know the guy.", "NTA - it would be super weird for you to bring your sister on a third date, and it's way more weird that she's insisting on joining you too", "Whoa, what is up with your sister. \n\nIf you want to keep seeing this person do not bring a sibling to your third date. In fact, if my sister acted entitled to this I\u2019d be sure not to be going anywhere with her much less thinking about acquiescing. NTA", "NTA... Although you are older than what I was at the time & hopefully no-one is forcing you, this post sends slimy shivers of cringy memories down my spine. \n\nWhen I started dating at 16yo, my birth mother forced me to *always* take either my 13yo sister or my 10yo brother with us. It was so freaking embarrassing to have a younger sibling tagging along.", "NTA but if she knows when you are going, I'd switch to a different restaurant or change the date.", "NTA, your sisters behavior is being weirdly controlling about you actually dating.

So much so, that she\u2019s willing to wedge herself in between you and your love life just to get her way and not allow you to experience something on your own. That restaurant hasn\u2019t moved anywhere and your sister can go on her own anytime she wants. There\u2019s nothing wrong with eating at a restaurant alone, especially one that you really want to try. However, there is definitely something wrong with your sister. NTA", "NTA\nEww no, just no. You don't go out with your sibling on the third date. She can wait until you're a bit more settled into dating this person, which is the norm.", "I can imagine this poor guy's face when you show up with your sister. LMAO", "NTA. There\u2019s nothing stopping your 25 year old sister from trying the restaurant any other time. She sounds like she\u2019s being childish and trying to make you feel bad for something else and using it as an excuse. Don\u2019t give in and validate her poor behavior. If she\u2019s upset about it that\u2019s on her not you!", "Your sister is being a whackadoo. Nobody brings fam on a date. NTA", "This is a very alarming and immature request.  You need to establish some firm boundaries with your sister it is completely inappropriate to bring a family member on a 3rd date.  You don\u2019t even know this guy that well at this point.  My sister and I are almost a year apart we\u2019re extremely close and she has never tried to encroach and neither have I.", "NTA. Bringing your sister will ensure the date is a disaster. I can already see your sister complaining about the situation to you date over appetizers.", "NTA definitely the right call. Imagine showing up for a third date and a dude brought his brother. I feel like it would be super weird to show up on any kind of a date with my sister in tow.", "NTA. Bringing your sister for a third date doesn't make sense unless you're 12 yo. And your sister insisting that you should because she wants to know your date is just ludicrous. Being pissed because you'll go to this restaurant first with him rather than her is equally absurd.", "NTA", "NTA for not wanting to bring your sister on your 3rd date.  The time to introduce the two of them is a bit later on, and probably not on the date itself.  What differentiates a date from a hang out is the romantic aspect of it and having a friend or family member in tow detracts from that.  A lot.\n\nHowever, where you are at fault is wanting to go with your date to a restaurant that your sister previously told you she wants to try!  Be more considerate to your sister and choose another restaurant.  Come on now, that's really cold hearted.  Tell your sister that you are going to reserve that restaurant for you and her and will go with your date somewhere else.  And also tell her that you will introduce her soon, but you are still getting to know him (which is why you're going on the date in the first place).", "Ummm the guy will run if you bring her along so do you like the guy or trying to dump him?", "Yeah, definitely want more dates with him so I m just gonna stand my ground.", "That's what I m thinking. It's a sucky feeling but that's exactly what it would feel like tbh", "That's why I wasn't expecting this reaction. We are very close though, always have been and she is the most important person in my life but if she was going on a date then I wouldn't expect to go with. It feels weird", "Thanks. I think ensuring her will help her know that it's not that I don't want her going with out of malice, just wanna be alone with my date is all.", "Yeah XD, definitely not trying to be in a polycule with my sister", "Yeah, I will admit it was pretty careless of me to not seriously consider the fact that she really wanted to go to the very same restaurant. I did approach her to see if she wanted to go with me first before my date but she didn't want to. Perhaps should have just said I can go somewhere else with my date in the first place...but I think if I can talk to her we can resolve this.", "I don\u2019t blame you! And best of luck on the date \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc", "No that\u2019s fucking insane. It is not your job to rank and categorize your sisters dining desires. If she wants to go to a restaurant then she can go. If she wants you to go together then she can ask you. What she cannot do is try to wiggle into a private moment that has nothing to do with her because she wants to eat food. You have been put in a position where you are constantly worrying about her every feeling and being scared of her reaction. You are not responsible for anything she is putting on you. Fuck her feelings. They are her problem. This is all very weird. Seems like enmeshment. You and your sister do not have healthy boundaries and you are punished with guilt when you try to set them. Don\u2019t chase her. Don\u2019t fawn after her cause she got told no and is having a tantrum. You are going on a date. There is no discussion that needs to be had. \u201cI don\u2019t want you there\u201d is a good enough reason even if the date thing wasn\u2019t happening. You are allowed to have your own life.", "I've seen movies that start with sisters on a date with one guy but that's not for this part of Reddit\nNTA", "NTA  Your sister is being unreasonable, expecting to join you on a third date.  Also, remember you are going on a date.  You don't just invite a third person along.  You have to bring it up with your date whenever you want to include someone else and get their agreement up front before you ask the other person.  Does your date pay for the food?  It's not fair to create a situation where they are expected to pay for you and an unexpected Plus 1.   \n\nThat said, it's not unreasonable for your sister to want to meet your date.  But the way to do that is somewhere casual - your house, his, a coffee shop - where you can meet up, each get your own coffee etc.  and sit for half an hour or so.  Dates are not for third wheels.   Your sister needs to get over this idea that she's been wrong for not being invited.  Have you ever gone on one of her dates?", "NTA. Dates are for the people dating not third wheels. The time extra people are acceptable is on double dates or a group outing. It would have been extremely awkward to bring your sister with you.", "NTA do not fold, she should not be anywhere near your dates it ain't normal.", "Ummmmm NTA. Idk why she\u2019s inviting herself on your date. That\u2019s not a standard thing and very reasonable for you to decline", "Wtf did I just read?! Since when it\u2019s a thing to bring +1 to a date?! Like\u2026 wtf\u2026\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nIt's a DATE which is supposed to be TWO people. Not a double date. Not a third wheel.\n\nYou are a grown woman and ENTITLED to say NO. \n\nYour sister is upset because she is not being put first.", "Next we will see a post on here from your date saying \u201eaita for not wanting to pay for my date\u2018s sister that she dragged along on our date?\u201c. NTA this is a super weird request", "Is it an expensive restaurant?  Perhaps she's trying to mooch off of your date.", "Why does your sister want to date your boyfriend...that's messed up.", "I have never taken siblings along on a date.  Dates are \u201cget to know the other person\u201d, not \u201cmeet my family piecemeal.\u201d  My girlfriends have all met my family (and i met hers) at informal get-togethers; NOT dates. My wife first met my family when they visited, during outings with them\u2014NOT a date with my (now) wife. \n\nNTA\n\nBTW, sister is a huge AH just for asking to go on your date.", "NTA. Has she ever taken you along on her dates? I bet not.
