If you're so insecure about this, you could have had it 'fixed' a decade ago. Stop blaming your parents. Grow up.", "Info: is this a genuine medical problem or cosmetic?\n\nBecause it sounds like you are talking about a cosmetic problem... If so, are you suggesting that all kids with cosmetic issues that are surgically correctable (e.g. a big nose) should be told by their parents? If so, how do you imagine that playing out? (The only thing that comes to mind for me is something that would make someone *more* insecure about their looks, e.g. \"Hey, Hon, I don't know if you noticed, but you have a big nose. The doctors can surgically correct that, but we can't afford it. So, until you save up enough money to fix it, just know that you have a big nose\")", "NTA, but neither are your parents. It's a reasonable thing to be upset about, but unless they were *actively* hiding this from you, it seems like something you should eventually forgive them for. Sometimes things just don't come up, or are difficult to bring up, in conversation.", "YTA\n\nYou are 30. You have been an adult in charge of your own health for 12 years. You could have gone to the dentist yourself multiple times. You cannot blame your parents for not going through with a cosmetic fix while you were a child (yeah, it is expensive).\n\nAt this point, it's 100% on you.", "YTA - you\u2019re 30.

Your parents denying you dental/medical care when you were younger is neglectful and I can understand why you\u2019d be upset."]}
