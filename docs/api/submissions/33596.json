My sister N has 4 kids (boy and 3 girls). The boy is 21, lives with my other sister T for the past 6 years. Sister T gave an ultimatum to my nephew that if he doesn\u2019t finish community college, she\u2019s gonna kick him out. My nephew is not academically inclined but he tries his best to go to school, works and goes to the gym. My sister T complains so much about him being in the gym. Finally, he dropped out of his classes and offered to leave( due to my sister\u2019s ultimatum).\n\nHe offered to leave because he didn\u2019t want them to kick him out and be a disappointment. By the way, his father left him when he was little and his mom, my sister N, kinda left him and his sisters with my sister T, who took guardianship. My nephew said that he didn\u2019t wanna disappointment my sister T and her husband, so he said he\u2019ll leave. \n\nI offered for him to stay at my house because we have a spare bedroom, AND it\u2019s the holiday. He was gonna drive 6 hours to Michigan on Xmas eve, so I told him to stay here, or even forever since his life is here and he doesn\u2019t want to move. I told everyone in my family that he\u2019s staying with me, but my sister T because I was gonna tell her in person. \n\nToday, my sister texted me very angry why I didn\u2019t tell her about my plan. She left work early and couldn\u2019t do overtime because she had to go to the bank with my nephew to separate his account from hers, he was a minor when he opened his account. My sister T uninvited me and my family for Xmas eve because of this. She said I should\u2019ve told her what I was gonna do. I said why does it matter when you\u2019re kicking him out, and i was gonna tell her when she gets home from work (didn\u2019t know she was home early).\n\nI told sister T that forcing him to go to school is counter productive. Let him want to go or figure out what he wants to do. He works. He spends time at the gym. Or would you rather him be depressed, with the wrong people, do drugs and be miserable? \n\nAITAH?", "created_utc": 1703305759, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18oxm3m/aita_sister_is_mad_because_i_let_my_nephew_stay/", "score": 108, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why did you have to tell her you were taking him into YOUR house after she kicked him out? I would understand if the nephew didn't go to school or have a job then tes you are not being productive but that is not the case.", "He's an adult, so nobody has to house him. It's optional. Your sister's house, your sister's rules. She wanted to inspire him to succeed in school. To do that, she gave him an ultimatum. He knew the rules, it's within her rights to ask him to leave. It's understandable that he, realizing he'd broken her rules, would move out first.\n\nYou, though, are living in your house. Your house, your rules. You want to teach him that he has family that loves and supports him even if he doesn't meet the expectations of some. He takes care of his health, he tries. He's still young and finding his path. \n\nYour sister taught her lesson. You are entitled to teach yours. The timing of when you told her isn't important. You are NTA. You are being a good person whose priorities differ from those of your sister.", "NTA\nHe is an adult if you want to extend an offer of your spare room that\u2019s completely your choice. Good for you letting the man live his life as he see fit!", "NTA\n\nHe's an adult who can make his own decisions about whether he goes to school or not.  \n\nYour sister's probably pissed with you because her ultimatum backfired.  Maybe she never really intended to actually kick him out but now he's staying with you it's unlikely he'll ever go back to hers if the offer was there.", "NTA - I see two options here. One she never actually intended to kick him out. This was just a bluff and now shes angry that it didnt work. The other options is that shes embarressed that you took him in when she was going to kick him out. It's also possible that other family members are giving her a hard time for kicking him out and or she thinks they will. \n\nEither way she has created the situation. Now she needs to deal with it.", "NTA. If she's so concerned with where he's staying, maybe she shouldn't have kicked him out.", "NTA. But what is your nephew doing to make himself self sustainable? Beyond going to the gym?", "NTA. \n\nI suspect your sister\u2019s reaction is more about her and her relationship with her son than it is about you. You\u2019re just in the middle of it now. \n\nIt sounds like she\u2019s frustrated with her son\u2019s choices and his life direction- hopefully (?) because she loves him and wants what\u2019s best for him and is worried about his future. So she set up the ultimatum in hopes it would bring about the outcome she thinks is best for him. \n\nClearly it didn\u2019t work. So she\u2019s frustrated/scared and blaming you. \n\nHopefully when things calm down you can point out to her that you both love nephew and want what\u2019s best for him, you just have different approaches. \n\nAnd that eventually he figures out the life that works for him and you all live happily ever after.\n\nEdit- type-o", "NTA.  Once she kicked him out, she has no say in what anyone does.\n\nA word of advice, perhaps provide guidance to your nephew on getting into a trade school or apprenticeship program.  Not everyone needs to go to college.", "NTA, he needed a roof over his head and you provided it. She should not have given the ultimatum if she didn't want him to leave. Was she expecting him to be homeless because he didn't comply with what she really wanted?", "NTA. \n\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t I tell you? Because both nephews and I are adults and don\u2019t need your permission for anything.\u201d", "NTA \n\nYour sister T isn't a AH to your nephew, gave him his ultimatum, he didn't fulfil it, acknowledging that, he chose to move out and not make a scene.\n\nYour NTA, you see a family member in need, and you are seeing the good in them and providing support where you can, this does not affect your sister in any way after she had accepted his request to leave.\n\nShe is the AH however for treating you as such after the fact and uninviting you from Christmas dinner plans.", "Why is she getting so upset she uninvited you and such to celebrations. She clearly said if he doesn't do college he can't live with them, would she rather he move far away. Why is she so mad about it all.  NTA", "I\u2019m a bit confused - why was he living with his aunt in the first place? Did his mom already kick him out? \n\nI\u2019m just wondering if the problem is that the whole family is trying to parent him and he keeps finding Another place to stay where he doesn\u2019t have to take responsibility for himself.", "NTA, since you didn't want to disturb her at work.  Being a caring aunt is not a sin.\n\nJust be careful, he may have a lot more drama that she hasn't told anyone about.  Also, as a working adult, he should be paying you some kind of rent.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your sister can\u2019t kick people out of other people\u2019s houses, just her own.", "NTA. He is your nephew moving into your house. T can go suck a lemon. Not everyone is meant for college and that\u2019s ok.", "I feel like she's pissed off that he didn't just submit and do the school thing as she wanted him to do. Thanks for not leaving your nephew homeless. It's not a fun place to be. \ud83e\udef6\ud83e\ude77 She'll get over it. Or she won't.

If she invites us then we\u2019ll go, bringing my nephew with me because he is family.", "His mom kinda couldn\u2019t take care of him and his sisters for 5 years so my sister T took them in. The problem I believe is that my sister T treating him like her own little kids when he\u2019s  an adult. I just want him to take his own time figuring out what he wants to do as long as he takes care of business- work and pay his bills.", "The bio mom kicked out her 4 kids (3 girls and this nephew) when they were kids. They were raised by aunt 1 who's kicking out the boy and now living with aunt 2.\nThe poor kid has been abandoned by his bio dad, bio mom and now step parents....", "It's hard to make a judgment on this one. Not having even an associates will limit your opportunities in life a lot but I agree not everyone's path is school.", "Has he thought about trade schools? Since he is not too much of an academic, there are great opportunities that he could explore there.", "As an equal?", "With this thrown into the mix, and you wanting to give him a safe space to sort himself out; I would strongly suggest broaching the topic or therapy with nephew while he\u2019s under your care. If he\u2019s struggled academically in the past, there might be more to it than merely not be academically inclined. Home life can be a big factor in why students succeed or fail and it sounds like this kid hasn\u2019t had it easy.\n\nEdit: you mentioned your hubby being your therapist: even having therapeutic conversations with you and your husband could be a huge benefit to him. Especially if he hasn\u2019t had safe adults he can be open and vulnerable with previously. If your husband is half as good as you made him sound, he might be a solid candidate for a bit of casual mentoring while your nephew is with you.", "He\u2019s considering becoming a personal trainer and joining the navy. I don\u2019t want to push him, but let him find his own path and give him ideas, which my sister T lacks. I explained to my nephew that she means well when she gets upset with him with his life choices, that she wants him to be successful. She has two little kids of her own that sometimes she forgets to treat my nephew like an adult since she practically raised him the past 6 years.", "Actions done with good intentions don't negate negative consequences. \n\nOr, as Ned Flanders put it, oh but we can't blame you and your family because you had gooooooood intentions!\n\nIt doesn't matter what her intentions were, what matters is how she acted on those intentions, and her actions were damaging and unsupportive. I didn't see it until the last paragraph, but he _is_ working, he's not just sitting around expecting them to support him. He's getting work experience and still figuring out what he wants to do. It takes longer for some people to know what they want to do, and even longer to make that dream reality. \n\nNo, she was not under any obligation to continue to house him as he is an adult, but her 'good intentions' have made him see that he will only be supported by her when he does what _she_ wants. \n\nI hope he's able to realise that we can choose which family we keep and which we throw away because they're not good for us, no matter how good their intentions.", "Once he's settled, I would recommend him to do at least a small business course, it's needed by any entrepreneur and if he wants to have his own gym in the future, he's gonna need it... Also maybe something about managing. I think you can get 3 month courses everywhere"]}
