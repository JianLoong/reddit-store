My nephew is not academically inclined but he tries his best to go to school, works and goes to the gym. My sister T complains so much about him being in the gym. Finally, he dropped out of his classes and offered to leave( due to my sister\u2019s ultimatum).\n\nHe offered to leave because he didn\u2019t want them to kick him out and be a disappointment.

My sister T uninvited me and my family for Xmas eve because of this. She said I should\u2019ve told her what I was gonna do. I said why does it matter when you\u2019re kicking him out, and i was gonna tell her when she gets home from work (didn\u2019t know she was home early).\n\nI told sister T that forcing him to go to school is counter productive.

Why did you have to tell her you were taking him into YOUR house after she kicked him out? I would understand if the nephew didn't go to school or have a job then tes you are not being productive but that is not the case.", "He's an adult, so nobody has to house him. It's optional. Your sister's house, your sister's rules. She wanted to inspire him to succeed in school. To do that, she gave him an ultimatum. He knew the rules, it's within her rights to ask him to leave. It's understandable that he, realizing he'd broken her rules, would move out first.\n\nYou, though, are living in your house. Your house, your rules. You want to teach him that he has family that loves and supports him even if he doesn't meet the expectations of some. He takes care of his health, he tries. He's still young and finding his path. \n\nYour sister taught her lesson. You are entitled to teach yours. The timing of when you told her isn't important. You are NTA. You are being a good person whose priorities differ from those of your sister.", "NTA\nHe is an adult if you want to extend an offer of your spare room that\u2019s completely your choice. Good for you letting the man live his life as he see fit!", "NTA\n\nHe's an adult who can make his own decisions about whether he goes to school or not.  \n\nYour sister's probably pissed with you because her ultimatum backfired.  Maybe she never really intended to actually kick him out but now he's staying with you it's unlikely he'll ever go back to hers if the offer was there.", "NTA - I see two options here. One she never actually intended to kick him out. This was just a bluff and now shes angry that it didnt work. The other options is that shes embarressed that you took him in when she was going to kick him out. It's also possible that other family members are giving her a hard time for kicking him out and or she thinks they will. \n\nEither way she has created the situation. Now she needs to deal with it.", "NTA. If she's so concerned with where he's staying, maybe she shouldn't have kicked him out.", "NTA. But what is your nephew doing to make himself self sustainable? Beyond going to the gym?", "NTA. \n\nI suspect your sister\u2019s reaction is more about her and her relationship with her son than it is about you. You\u2019re just in the middle of it now. \n\nIt sounds like she\u2019s frustrated with her son\u2019s choices and his life direction- hopefully (?) because she loves him and wants what\u2019s best for him and is worried about his future. So she set up the ultimatum in hopes it would bring about the outcome she thinks is best for him. \n\nClearly it didn\u2019t work. So she\u2019s frustrated/scared and blaming you. \n\nHopefully when things calm down you can point out to her that you both love nephew and want what\u2019s best for him, you just have different approaches. \n\nAnd that eventually he figures out the life that works for him and you all live happily ever after.\n\nEdit- type-o", "NTA.  Once she kicked him out, she has no say in what anyone does.\n\nA word of advice, perhaps provide guidance to your nephew on getting into a trade school or apprenticeship program.  Not everyone needs to go to college.", "NTA, he needed a roof over his head and you provided it. She should not have given the ultimatum if she didn't want him to leave. Was she expecting him to be homeless because he didn't comply with what she really wanted?", "NTA. \n\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t I tell you?

Did his mom already kick him out? \n\nI\u2019m just wondering if the problem is that the whole family is trying to parent him and he keeps finding Another place to stay where he doesn\u2019t have to take responsibility for himself.", "NTA, since you didn't want to disturb her at work.

Home life can be a big factor in why students succeed or fail and it sounds like this kid hasn\u2019t had it easy.\n\nEdit: you mentioned your hubby being your therapist: even having therapeutic conversations with you and your husband could be a huge benefit to him.

It takes longer for some people to know what they want to do, and even longer to make that dream reality. \n\nNo, she was not under any obligation to continue to house him as he is an adult, but her 'good intentions' have made him see that he will only be supported by her when he does what _she_ wants. \n\nI hope he's able to realise that we can choose which family we keep and which we throw away because they're not good for us, no matter how good their intentions.", "Once he's settled, I would recommend him to do at least a small business course, it's needed by any entrepreneur and if he wants to have his own gym in the future, he's gonna need it...

This young man needs direction and sister has thrown her hands up in the air and said fuck it, im done. He has a job. So he is not a complete loser. And extended school isnt for every one.

Yeah it doesn't work like that, NTA.", "NTA\n\nHe is only young. He was being kicked out so you took him in. He's had enough rejection in his life as it is. \n\nCollege is not for everyone.

Was she hoping he\u2019d end up homeless and hungry?\n\nShe needs to back off - she\u2019s far too controlling. And you\u2019re right about college - if it isn\u2019t for him, then it just isn\u2019t.

OP is NTA. It sounds like this kid is trying in life and still finding his way. And he\u2019s better off spending two hours in the gym as opposed to two hours drinking beer with his buddies while playing video games.

She taught him that he can't make decisions on his own if she doesn't approve of them. She thought he had no other choices. He did and does.

They are diagnosed now but I currently don\u2019t have insurance because my job fired me. No job in my field will hire me because I need accommodations for my illnesses so now I need to side hustle just to pay for medicine. So now I have a useless 100,000 degree. Just to be clear. No companies have explicitly said they won\u2019t hire me because of my illnesses but back before I was sick, I had companies calling me offering a job unsolicited and now I can\u2019t even get a phone interview.

It took him approximately 12 years to go from the very bottom of the labor pool to a middle manager. Granted he did eventually have to go to college in order to go that high in project management (of home building specifically), but once the classes were focused on an area he was interested in and inclined in, he busted through them. \n\nRandom but I also just saw an extended discussion on Facebook about the best way to handle a brick fireplace in an old (for the US) home. There were all sorts of mitigating factors and the things I was learning from the stone masons was simply amazing. Like they could tell (by color) that the brick in the fireplace was a weaker brick because when it was created it was further out from the heat source\u2026making it not as red. And now it needs special treatment so that it doesn\u2019t disintegrate. The special treatment should be a lime wash, which you need to be careful with because it has a very high ph and can hurt you.

If not, then he can stay at my place. Everything was set in stone that he was moving because most of his stuff is in his car. So what was I suppose to do? Let him leave his life he built here?
