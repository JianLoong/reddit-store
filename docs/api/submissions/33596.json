I said why does it matter when you\u2019re kicking him out, and i was gonna tell her when she gets home from work (didn\u2019t know she was home early).\n\nI told sister T that forcing him to go to school is counter productive.

Why did you have to tell her you were taking him into YOUR house after she kicked him out? I would understand if the nephew didn't go to school or have a job then tes you are not being productive but that is not the case.", "He's an adult, so nobody has to house him. It's optional. Your sister's house, your sister's rules. She wanted to inspire him to succeed in school. To do that, she gave him an ultimatum. He knew the rules, it's within her rights to ask him to leave. It's understandable that he, realizing he'd broken her rules, would move out first.\n\nYou, though, are living in your house. Your house, your rules. You want to teach him that he has family that loves and supports him even if he doesn't meet the expectations of some. He takes care of his health, he tries. He's still young and finding his path. \n\nYour sister taught her lesson. You are entitled to teach yours. The timing of when you told her isn't important. You are NTA. You are being a good person whose priorities differ from those of your sister.", "NTA\nHe is an adult if you want to extend an offer of your spare room that\u2019s completely your choice. Good for you letting the man live his life as he see fit!", "NTA\n\nHe's an adult who can make his own decisions about whether he goes to school or not.  \n\nYour sister's probably pissed with you because her ultimatum backfired.  Maybe she never really intended to actually kick him out but now he's staying with you it's unlikely he'll ever go back to hers if the offer was there.", "NTA - I see two options here. One she never actually intended to kick him out. This was just a bluff and now shes angry that it didnt work. The other options is that shes embarressed that you took him in when she was going to kick him out. It's also possible that other family members are giving her a hard time for kicking him out and or she thinks they will. \n\nEither way she has created the situation. Now she needs to deal with it.", "NTA. If she's so concerned with where he's staying, maybe she shouldn't have kicked him out.", "NTA. But what is your nephew doing to make himself self sustainable? Beyond going to the gym?", "NTA. \n\nI suspect your sister\u2019s reaction is more about her and her relationship with her son than it is about you. You\u2019re just in the middle of it now. \n\nIt sounds like she\u2019s frustrated with her son\u2019s choices and his life direction- hopefully (?) because she loves him and wants what\u2019s best for him and is worried about his future. So she set up the ultimatum in hopes it would bring about the outcome she thinks is best for him. \n\nClearly it didn\u2019t work. So she\u2019s frustrated/scared and blaming you. \n\nHopefully when things calm down you can point out to her that you both love nephew and want what\u2019s best for him, you just have different approaches. \n\nAnd that eventually he figures out the life that works for him and you all live happily ever after.\n\nEdit- type-o", "NTA.  Once she kicked him out, she has no say in what anyone does.\n\nA word of advice, perhaps provide guidance to your nephew on getting into a trade school or apprenticeship program.  Not everyone needs to go to college.", "NTA, he needed a roof over his head and you provided it. She should not have given the ultimatum if she didn't want him to leave. Was she expecting him to be homeless because he didn't comply with what she really wanted?", "NTA. \n\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t I tell you?

Home life can be a big factor in why students succeed or fail and it sounds like this kid hasn\u2019t had it easy.\n\nEdit: you mentioned your hubby being your therapist: even having therapeutic conversations with you and your husband could be a huge benefit to him.

It takes longer for some people to know what they want to do, and even longer to make that dream reality. \n\nNo, she was not under any obligation to continue to house him as he is an adult, but her 'good intentions' have made him see that he will only be supported by her when he does what _she_ wants. \n\nI hope he's able to realise that we can choose which family we keep and which we throw away because they're not good for us, no matter how good their intentions.", "Once he's settled, I would recommend him to do at least a small business course, it's needed by any entrepreneur and if he wants to have his own gym in the future, he's gonna need it...

Yeah it doesn't work like that, NTA.", "NTA\n\nHe is only young. He was being kicked out so you took him in. He's had enough rejection in his life as it is. \n\nCollege is not for everyone.

You\u2019re an adult who can allow anybody to stay with you without your sister\u2019s knowledge or permission. Was she hoping he\u2019d end up homeless and hungry?\n\nShe needs to back off - she\u2019s far too controlling. And you\u2019re right about college - if it isn\u2019t for him, then it just isn\u2019t.

OP is NTA. It sounds like this kid is trying in life and still finding his way. And he\u2019s better off spending two hours in the gym as opposed to two hours drinking beer with his buddies while playing video games. For some reason, people often find the latter more acceptable even though people often make friends and bond over working out just like they would drinking and playing games.", "She didn't want to inspire him. She wanted to manipulate him and push him into a corner. She wanted him to do what she wanted him to do and not what he wanted to do. He wasn't an adult while living there the whole time.

She taught him that he can't make decisions on his own if she doesn't approve of them. She thought he had no other choices. He did and does.

No companies have explicitly said they won\u2019t hire me because of my illnesses but back before I was sick, I had companies calling me offering a job unsolicited and now I can\u2019t even get a phone interview.

There were all sorts of mitigating factors and the things I was learning from the stone masons was simply amazing. Like they could tell (by color) that the brick in the fireplace was a weaker brick because when it was created it was further out from the heat source\u2026making it not as red. And now it needs special treatment so that it doesn\u2019t disintegrate. The special treatment should be a lime wash, which you need to be careful with because it has a very high ph and can hurt you. You can mitigate some of the effects if it gets on your skin by adding acid like lemon juice. \n\nThey weren\u2019t learning this stuff in college!!", "My kitchen fitter could barely write and he earned more per hour than a fucking NHS heart surgeon. I'm a hospital manager and I did the maths!", "If he does plan for the navy make sure there\u2019s something he has an interest in cuz MOS (totally called differently for the Navy I did army and reserve guards from 2011-2019 my sister however is in the navy) hopefully he\u2019ll find something that he likes to do!"]}
