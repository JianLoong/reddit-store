You don't owe them a relationship if it's not what you want. \n\nYou need to let go of this money resentment, though. Lot's of people have to pay for their own education. No one owed you a college fund. The issue is more that they tried to use the fund as leverage to control you. Asking for a cashier's check as a condition to meet with them wasn't classy.

Honestly even giving you the tuition they withheld wouldn't be enough for me to forgive them if I were you, but it would at least be something significant to show they were willing to make up for their wrongs.

That way your therapist could determine if there's anything of real value to be added to your life. This is assuming you have a good and longstanding relationship with said therapist of course.\n\nMy husband hasn't had contact with his family for 9+ years. I was there when everything had to change, and I saw how deeply it wounded him. In other words, I think having no contact can absolutely be born of necessity.

Once you were 18 you had every right to cut them off but as an adult it became your choice and responsibility to pay for an attend college if your parents didn\u2019t want to pay for an out of state school. In choosing your freedom you also made the choice to give up their financial support.

It puts them into financial hardship (which they deserve for favoring your sisters over you in their desire to keep you in a glass case) and allows for sympathy from other family members and more needless drama for you when you go away again after hearing them out.\n\n2. It gives the impression of false hope which feels good to you now but paints you in a bad light and allows for other family to disturb you by getting involved.\n\n3. Most importantly, it\u2019s an achievable (potentially) goal and allows them access to you if only for the single conversation which, depending on what is said, could be anything from a non starter to a bombshell that leads to years of more therapy. Do you want that? \n\nSo my suggestion is to forget about the money. Use them against themselves instead. Clearly they want access to you and your time. Both treasured commodities. Money is a non issue for you and shouldn\u2019t be the selling point for having the conversation they want with you. Instead, change your conditions. Tell them that the only way you will entertain this conversation with them is if they arrive with a completely different childhood and growing experience than the one they made you endure and THEN you\u2019ll be willing to talk.\n\nWhen it comes to NC and estranged family; an impossible task should be exactly that: impossible. Otherwise what you are really saying via demonstration is that part of you is enjoying making them suffer which, despite your clear anger, isn\u2019t the vibe I get from you.\n\nYou simply want to live the life you built for yourself after escaping from your parents and their unchecked insanity. Life you live on your terms and without anyone else to challenge or check you for it. So do that and close the door on that chapter of your life until/unless the time comes you want to revisit it.\n\nAnd this conversation? It\u2019s a ploy. Nothing is so great or secret that your sisters or family can\u2019t relay the message to you. Don\u2019t let them play you.

Listen kids aren't entitled to free education from their parents. It's always so weird to see these posts demanding all this money for school because I just wasn't raised that way and most of the nation isn't either. Having someone mortgage their home is nuts to me. It has to be somewhat daunting to go these lengths to actively try not to forgive someone. I know a lot of parents who refuse to pay for their kids schooling because it's out of state because it's much more expensive, you're not the only one by a landslide. You could have gone in state and gotten that experience and used their money. As far as the helicopter parents goes, yes they were wrong for that but if you want to ignore them to their death, you probably will regret that as well.

There wasn't really anything wrong with him, but his father meddled and tried to make the therapist disclose what was discussed in the sessions. The therapist had to explain patient confidentiality, but then made the suggestion that the father could benefit from a session himself as he seems to harbour some toxic behaviours which they could work through.

That is a punishment that fits the crime. What you are doing is horrible. They would've paid for you if you went instate. So it wasn't like they wouldn't pay for you. Also they did it out of love and fear which, although doesn't absolve them, but at least makes them a but more sympathetic. Clearly they have some unresolved trauma from the first child's death.

I'm gonna go against the grain and say ESH. \n\nYour parents obviously did wrong by you but, based on what you wrote, it was a response to their own untreated trauma, not vindictive. And other kids bullying you for their behavior is not their fault either (at least not entirely). Your response of going NC is reasonable if that's what you need to be healthy and happy, but unless there's a whole lot more that they did than what you're saying, you're taking an immature, avoidant, and unhealthy approach.\n\nAgain, *all I have to go off of is what you wrote*, which just described grieving, overprotective parents. Maybe there's a lot more that you didn't share, which would change my response,, but IF that's the extent of it, then the healthy, mature approach would just be to actually hear them out, communicate where you're coming from and what you feel (clearly and directly, not via a third party unless it's a written letter), and then see if you can move forward or not. That healthy confrontation would actually enable forward movement and growth, not the insane cycle you're currently stuck in of maintaining 12 separate email accounts just to avoid your overprotective parents. \n\nThe whole \"if you pay, you can talk to me\" angle is a terrible idea all around, though. Aside from being an AH move, it's going to have the exact OPPOSITE effect you seem to think it will. Your parents are clearly desperate to contact you and try to re-build a relationship with you. ANY glimmer of hope that you're open to that, even something as extortionate and extreme as \"pay $250,000 that you don't have, to someone who doesn't need it\" is something that they will cling to, *because it's not a \"no,\" it's a \"maybe\"*. \n\nIf your actual goal, no matter what they do, is 100% NC forever, you just did the worst possible option, because now they have a number for what it takes to talk to you, and they'll likely do just about anything to do it.
