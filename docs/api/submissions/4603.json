My parents let them travel, play field hockey, I could go on but I'm getting angry just thinking about it.  \n\nI was bullied for my parents helicopter behavior.  \n\nI applied for university far enough away from them that they would not be able to interfere with me. They tried to say they weren't going to pay for out of state college. They withheld my educational account.  \n\nI went into debt to get my education. I chose a major that I knew would earn me money instead of studying what I really wanted.  It was worth it.  I was recruited and currently work at a FAANG.  \n\nI graduated six years years ago and I paid off my student loan. I have not spoken to my parents since I graduated high school.

My grandparents, uncles, aunts, cousins. Even my sisters. I only have one rule. Do not tell my parents how to get ahold of me.

I only had to do it to one of my cousins who thought my parents could talk me into going to her wedding.  I deleted the account. \n\nMy middle sister said that my parents need to talk to me.

Certainly, it's reasonable for a therapist to help if they want to repair your emotional relationship. You don't owe them a relationship if it's not what you want. \n\nYou need to let go of this money resentment, though. Lot's of people have to pay for their own education. No one owed you a college fund. The issue is more that they tried to use the fund as leverage to control you. Asking for a cashier's check as a condition to meet with them wasn't classy. You either want to repair the relationship or you want to let it go, but you aren't justified extorting them any more than they were justified in trying to control your life decisions.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"I spoke to my therapist.

Do you really want to start a relationship wirth your abusers?** And tell your sisters to stop talking to you about your parents.", "NTA. I was going to say that this is way beyond a question for Reddit and you should talk to a therapist but I see you already do.  I hope you are doing well and you are happy. Your parents probably need a lot of therapy too.  I cannot imagine losing a kid. I am hoping you know an internet stranger is wishing you nothing but the best.", "NTA. But what's with the money? Your parents don't owe it to you. Either meet with them, or don't. Meeting in the therapist's office, fine. That's reasonable.  \nBut the money? That's irrational and irrelevant. Even if they'd spent it in themselves and not your sisters, it's still irrelevant. Taking money from them is only going to allow them to tie a string to you. If you really want to be free and clear, forget the money and don't acknowledge them.", "Your NTA but you realise your parents think they're buying your forgiveness and back in to your life, when they hand over that check and you then stay NC that will push you into being an asshole.\n\nYou don't want your parents in your life, you just want to punish them and I get it but all it will do is make the situation worse, putting an elderly couple in debt to prove a point will ruin the relationship you have with the rest of your family, I totally get that they screwed you but screwing them back won't fix it. \nMaybe you'll feel better for a minute but to every single other member of your family who has respected your boundaries you'll be as bad as your parents, so go for it but just know you'll be ruining what you currently have if you do, if your prepared to have to walk away from the rest of your family, this to me because of YOUR behaviour to get even with people you don't even seem to like or want a relationship you do you, I hope the cheque is worth the door your opening.", "NTA. You are methodical, reasonable and consistent in dealing with your trauma. They don't get to have a say in that. You made your terms known. It's theirs to agree to them or stay away - as you said - for free. You made it clear from the get go that you won't be accommodating them unless they are willing to meet you halfway, which - as somebody who dealt with abusive parents in the past - I applaud and understand.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with giving them a chance, but it'd be equally fair to say you don't care, and your sisters should just drop the issue. Your choice.", "NTA they stole your childhood from you. Honestly even giving you the tuition they withheld wouldn't be enough for me to forgive them if I were you, but it would at least be something significant to show they were willing to make up for their wrongs. It's their own fault they gave that fund away and they can figure out how to replace it if they want the privilege of starting to mend things to be in your life. Personally though I wouldn't even bother, you're a better person then I am for even giving them a chance to make it up to you.", "NTA. I wish everyone would demand their independence and set boundaries like you have. Tell your sister to keep her opinions to herself if she doesn't want to be cut off too.", "NTA, It's good that you consulted your therapist first. The chance that you ever get the money is minimal, but you probably know that yourself.", " NTA. Just read your comments. It\u2019s clear you don\u2019t want contact, so why even give a condition. Just say no. It\u2019s that simple. Don\u2019t string them along.", "NTA. No, you don\u2019t need the money but it\u2019s the principle. Stand your ground. If you\u2019re okay with never seeing them or talking to them again then so be it. Them trying to control you by making you feel as if your only option for education was to do as they wanted is the type of parenting I hate. When will people understand this only pushes your kids away.", "NTA, though I wouldn't leave the door open so a cashiers check gains them entry. \n\nIf anything, and it's a big if, I'd ask your therapist if they alone would be willing to have a session with your parents. That way your therapist could determine if there's anything of real value to be added to your life. This is assuming you have a good and longstanding relationship with said therapist of course.\n\nMy husband hasn't had contact with his family for 9+ years. I was there when everything had to change, and I saw how deeply it wounded him. In other words, I think having no contact can absolutely be born of necessity. I also think it can be the best course to maintain.", "Surprised to say YTA, that last section turned it around.  You've had your revenge by living well, as the old saying goes.  Demanding money you don't need comes across as childish.", "Good on you for going to therapy and wanting the reunion to be in a therapeutic place... \n\nThat being said, I'm going against the grain here and saying YTA\n\nYour parents were helicopter parents worried about your safety. Not out of spite or some mean thing \n\nThe whole money thing is the topper. You chose to go out of state and they said they wouldn't pay for it. You knew they weren't going to pay for it. They never said they would pay for out if State school. Now you want them to give you money they never said they would. \n\nIt's your choice to cut them out, but it seems like your parents did what they did out of fear and love. They weren't trying to be malicious.", "NTA. \n\nYour reasons for cutting them off seem a little spurious to me but I did not live your experience. \nYou feel how you feel. If cutting them off makes you feel better go for it.", "YTA.  Lightly.  About the money.  You\u2019ve proven that you don\u2019t need them in your life to be successful.  You cut them off for a reason.  Let them go.  Tell your siblings that you are not now nor will you ever be interested in having a relationship with your parents\u2014discussion over.  Then go on with your life.", "Soft YTA.\n\nYou feel how you feel, and how you feel is both valid and reasonable.Talk to them or not. That's your choice. Just like going to an out-of-state school was your choice. \n\nThey weren't obligated to pay for your education, and they still aren't. Putting a price tag on a conversation seems.... a bit much. I wonder if you're doing that because you know it's a sum they can't pay, thereby protecting you from the conversation.\n\nIf you don't want to talk to them, just say no.", "NTA for not wanting your parents in your life.\n\nWhat they did sounds like it came from a place of love and trauma and they'd better benefit from spending that money on their own therapy.\n\nIt sounds like your American so the amount of cash your asking for is unrealistic. They don't have it to give. If you don't want to entertain an conversation with them just say that. \n\nThat they're trying to find that money says they are at least willing to try and fix things.\n\nI honestly think you should have that group session with your therapist, even if you decide you never want to heal that relationship.", "Soft YTA  -  your parents were obviously broken traumatised people who couldn\u2019t cope with the thought of losing a second son and over compensated with way too much helicopter parenting and caution when it came to raising you.\n\nHow much you want to punish them forever for that is up to you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
