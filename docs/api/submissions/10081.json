The issue comes with their young beagle mix shelter dog.\n\nIt started wandering into our yard almost immediately, and when we first asked about it, they told us, \"Oh yeah, that's just rover, he likes to wander.\" My wife and I side eyed each other, but whatever, as long as the dog is friendly, it's not really a bother. Well the dog started frequenting our yard more and more, and when I would tell it to go home he would bark and howl at me aggressively, but would eventually go back to his house. \n\nLate summer our young kids were playing in our yard and the dog came at them barking aggressively and scared them badly. I yelled at the dog and told one of the owners that it was NOT ok and that the dog needed to stay off my property.\n\n It didn't stick. The dog was seen repeatedly in my yard after, but by the time I got outside either an owner yelled at it to come back, or it left on its own. \n\nFast forward to November, and the dog was neutered. It was EXTREMELY aggressive, and multiple times it came in to my yard barking, snarling, and snapping at us. Each time I was able to intervene, but had a couple close calls.\n\nDecember, I told the teenage son to keep it off my property (because that is who came to get the dog), later that day it came back barking and snapping at me. The other owner told it to get inside, I told him to keep it off my property or I'll call animal control. He responded with a shrug and \"Do what you gotta do.\" So I called animal control and asked them to warn that I am within my rights to press charges.\n\nThe dog seemed somewhat contained in January, but about two weeks ago, I started seeing it in my yard again. Three days ago I chased it off because my wife saw it under our carport and was scared to leave her van. Next morning, it was on our front walkway as we were leaving to get kids to school and get to work, I put myself between it and my family so they could get to the van and leave. The whole time it's barking, howling, growling at me, but keeping distance. \n\nI completely had enough, I called animal control and pressed charges for a potentially dangerous dog. They said the owners could get it back within a day or two as long as they abide by certain rules (putting dangerous dog signs up, dog has to be leashed and muzzled, etc.) but since the dog hasn't bitten anyone yet the dangerous dog likely won't stick, and I could file a \"nuisance animal\" charge, since the dog has impeded our ability to enjoy our property. So today I went to the county and filed that.\n\nI'm second guessing if my course of action was too harsh. I'm genuinely worried for my family's safety around that dog, and don't want it on my property.
