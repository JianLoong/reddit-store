It's in a quiet neighborhood that we really like. Our neighbors seem like ok people overall. I am happy to let them be and enjoy our house and property. The issue comes with their young beagle mix shelter dog.\n\nIt started wandering into our yard almost immediately, and when we first asked about it, they told us, \"Oh yeah, that's just rover, he likes to wander.\" My wife and I side eyed each other, but whatever, as long as the dog is friendly, it's not really a bother. Well the dog started frequenting our yard more and more, and when I would tell it to go home he would bark and howl at me aggressively, but would eventually go back to his house. \n\nLate summer our young kids were playing in our yard and the dog came at them barking aggressively and scared them badly. I yelled at the dog and told one of the owners that it was NOT ok and that the dog needed to stay off my property.\n\n It didn't stick. The dog was seen repeatedly in my yard after, but by the time I got outside either an owner yelled at it to come back, or it left on its own. \n\nFast forward to November, and the dog was neutered. It was EXTREMELY aggressive, and multiple times it came in to my yard barking, snarling, and snapping at us. Each time I was able to intervene, but had a couple close calls.\n\nDecember, I told the teenage son to keep it off my property (because that is who came to get the dog), later that day it came back barking and snapping at me. The other owner told it to get inside, I told him to keep it off my property or I'll call animal control. He responded with a shrug and \"Do what you gotta do.\" So I called animal control and asked them to warn that I am within my rights to press charges.\n\nThe dog seemed somewhat contained in January, but about two weeks ago, I started seeing it in my yard again. Three days ago I chased it off because my wife saw it under our carport and was scared to leave her van. Next morning, it was on our front walkway as we were leaving to get kids to school and get to work, I put myself between it and my family so they could get to the van and leave. The whole time it's barking, howling, growling at me, but keeping distance. \n\nI completely had enough, I called animal control and pressed charges for a potentially dangerous dog. They said the owners could get it back within a day or two as long as they abide by certain rules (putting dangerous dog signs up, dog has to be leashed and muzzled, etc.) but since the dog hasn't bitten anyone yet the dangerous dog likely won't stick, and I could file a \"nuisance animal\" charge, since the dog has impeded our ability to enjoy our property. So today I went to the county and filed that.\n\nI'm second guessing if my course of action was too harsh. I'm genuinely worried for my family's safety around that dog, and don't want it on my property.

I lost count of the number of times I found him just standing in the road, or that I put out water for him. I talked to the owners, but they didn't seem to care.\n\nOne day, I saw him in the road, got some treats, and called him over to me. I plopped him in the car, and drove him over to animal control. I explained the problem. This poor dog was out wandering all day, in the hot Texas sun, not fixed, and ignored by his owners.

This dog sounds like a medical emergency waiting to happen.", "NTA. An agressive dog is the owner's responsibility to deal with, which your neighbors haven't done - either by keeping it out of your yard somehow or by getting it trained, and your neighbors were dismissive of you when you asked them to control their dog. They literally left you with no choice. And I'm sure they would rather deal with animal control than the authorities if the dog had harmed a member of your family.

We have a fish pond. I\u2019m afraid she will fall in there. Sadly I don\u2019t know how to tell the woman to leave her cats inside of the house. I sincerely hope they find another house very far from here and never come back.", "You are NTA. I feel bad for the dog", "NTA.\n\nMy neighbours have a beagle, it\u2019s quite the escape artist.  It made it into my backyard a couple of times.  Each time it got in my neighbours took further steps to stop it happening again.  In the end they had to do some serious fencing works (including underground to stop tunneling) to contain the dog - which was a friendly little fellow\n\nThat\u2019s what good neighbours do.

It had become a danger to your wife and kids and you. I'd also look into having a fence (or better fence) put in whenever possible.

Their dogs ran across our lawn and cornered my brother and I against a tree while barking and growling at us. My mom had to chase them off with a broom after hearing us scream from inside the house.

Them being totally shitty people doesn't mean you should have to put up with it on your property. If they had it under control and out of your space and it was barking then I would probably say you need to cool off, but once it is not under control then the gloves come off.\n\nThat dog deserves better as well and shouldn't have to deal with parents that don't give a shit about where it goes or who it encounters.", "NTA, but you're gonna need to put up a fence. I understand that isn't exactly fair but it's really the only solution and will keep other animals out too.", "NTA Nope you are not wrong.  Past experience though says get outside cameras that way you have evidence of the aggressive behavior (without the biting).  You may also want to consider a privacy fence.  Also write down dates and times of each occurrence that way you have some solid information about the problem try to include as much detail as possible.\n\nMy problem was with renters and I called their landlord and the cops so much that when they stopped paying rent the landlord decided he had enough and evicted them.
