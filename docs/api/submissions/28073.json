Don't tell her you don't want. Next time you'll have school or a class you signed for and that it's not refundable. Also, you're going to be allergic to dogs. Also, you're going to get medications that don't allow you to be alone with children. Also +++ add new believable excuses +++. Always offer a \"next time\" and make sure to tell her you adore the children etc. If she'll complain, be surprised \"cousin, you built your life, why am I not supposed to build mine?\" \"cousin, didn't know your brother was so unhelpful, time to teach him.\" If she gets mean, remember her you haven't forgotten about the cousins reunion.", "No offense, OP, but if you don't learn to take care of and prioritize yourself,  you will be an AH to you.\n\nAs you've stated, you don't have anyone to look after you where she has her husband and her brother is there. With three adult incomes in that home, if you hadn't moved back she would be either asking her family, his family, or paying someone to see to her kids. \n\nTake yourself out of that equation completely. Your mental health and well being are the priority right now. You are not equipped or capable of caring for children right now and need to focus on yourself. Your only reply to her concerning her kids and taking care of anything for her right now should be, \"I'm sorry, I'm not going to be able to do it.\" Don't elaborate, don't be any more apologetic than that.

Reach out to socialize with your other cousins, to hang out or plan fill events so she can't isolate you.\n\nTell her you're not available for child or dog care", "NTA\n\nNo, you're not required to tailormake your life to the needs of family, and fuck any person or culture that says otherwise. It's clear you've been made to be a people pleaser all your life, and it's good that you're looking to maintain yourself and grow as a person for your own needs. Don't let anyone suggest that you're the asshole for not being a doormat.", "Disagree. Why is it that the husband, the brother, or any family/friends that were already in town aren't the cousin's go to 'emergency' babysitters?  As a matter of fact, this should have been established well before OP returned to this town.\n\nOP is a person who NEEDS to concentrate on her health and well being. She can't help anyone else if she's drowning herself.\n\nThe cousin didn't ask about an emergency situation. She wants OP to be the de facto solution to their problem.\n\nAnd by the way, when you don't have kids you CAN be 'selfish' (although it's NOT being selfish--you're living the life you chose) about when or if you want to be bothered with them. That's the result of the choice you make not to have kids vs. choosing to have them."]}
