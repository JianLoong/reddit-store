For example dementia. This could make the dog behave irrationally and even become aggressive. But it's still a family member for your wife and it's hard to let go. Just as some people hate putting their older relatives in a nursing home when needed it can be hard to let go of a beloved pet. So giving your wife an ultimatum in the heat of the moment, that's a-hole behaviour.\n\nWhat you need to consider is this: Do you still want out of the marriage even if the dog leaves? Than it has nothing to do with the dog, then it's YOU that want out and you're using the dog as an excuse. Be truthful to both yourself and your wife.", "NTA.  The dog attacked you and your mother and your child could have been harmed in the process, and she chose the dog?  I understand emotions were high, but if she had even said to give her a moment with the dog before he is gone that would have been a better reaction.  \n\nI understand your stance.

OP is absolutely correct to want this dangerous animal put down, I completely agree with that. I am a dog parent, have 4 of them, if they ever showed aggression, bit my spouse, attacked, unprovoked, I would put the animal down. No questions asked. I say OP sucks for reacting to wife in anger, in the heat of the moment, for threatening to end the marriage, when everyone had hot tempers. The wife for knowing this animal has been getting more aggressive and has attacked people, it will only escalate and get worse. She should have done something about the animal before it got this bad.

So the question again is...do you want your marriage over? Do you want your son raised by divorced parents? In two homes?   Is all the love gone?

I know humans with dementia and other mental issues related to age can become really aggressive and violent and I bet that it\u2019s similar with dogs, but I have done no research into it. It\u2019s sad for your wife that her beloved pet has reached that stage but the humane thing, and the safest for everyone especially your child, is to have  vet euthanize him.

I understand the dog bit you but that dog was there before you. It was a beloved pet. Dogs don't just turn like that and there may have been something wrong.

If you are ending your marriage over a dog...I feel like there are underlying problems not in this reddit post and maybe you both should go to counseling.

The dog os clearly becominf a danger to you and your family. As a pet owner I can understand how hard it is to let go but your family's safety is more important than a dog.", "NTA. The dog has attacked you multiple times leaving SCARS. He\u2019s also attempted to attack your mother. \n\nYou also have a 2 month old (?) child in the house! You can\u2019t let this dog carry on with this behaviour. Shame on your wife for not considering her son and husbands safety first.\n\nHowever, I think you threatening to break up with her was a bit extreme. Then again, if this situation repeatedly happened and the dog has repeated attacked someone and she still chose to keep the dog, then I think I understand your reasoning. \n\nI think you should have a long and proper conversation with your wife, rather than breaking up with her", "Yes, I think that\u2019s what he meant. If so, he\u2019s the AH. He says they got an expensive trainer. I just don\u2019t understand the dog being fine with him in the beginning and becoming aggressive with just him, over time. Something is not adding up. It makes me think the dog believes OP to be aggressive towards him or his wife. \n\nAt any rate the dog does not have to be put down. Another pet owner, who is familiar with the breed and perhaps problem dogs, could be sought out. We don\u2019t know if the dog would even be aggressive to anyone else.", "Dog is 11-12 years old. Breed lives to about 16.", "Wow, you make this about him?  He, his child, and his mom were threatened by a dog, but this about him.  Not about his wife?  Ugh, you fucking people.", "The kid is 2 months and was sound asleep. I rocked him for 30 minutes before.\n\nThe dog lunged at me after I payed him down and told him to move because he was too close to the child\u2019s bed in the middle of where we need to walk to get him in the night. We wouldn\u2019t see the dog and he would be a tripping hazard.", "I absolutely agree with you. He needs to understand that she is was also in shock over this last incident and probably hadn\u2019t had time to process it yet. It isn\u2019t an easy situation as she had many good years with the dog before the behavior started.  If she did the right thing in the end he needs to be more understanding.", "Awful advice. This isnt about son being raised by divorced parents in separate homes. This isnt about the son at all.", "Completely agree with ESH based on the edits.\n\nI can cut OP\u2019s wife some slack in the moment. She and her dog have been together longer than she and OP. Having an instinctual reaction to protect her dog is maybe not Disney movie love level of priorities, but it\u2019s not a character flaw either\n\nGiven time to process, she\u2019s prioritising marriage and family.\n\nOP being hurt is justifiable. OP ending his marriage and family based on a single incident is so over the top it\u2019s unlikely to be true.\n\nSo ESH", "I'm sorry but i think OP is being fair, the dog has been aggressive for ***years*** and the wife had done the minimal about it. All its takes is one moment and the dog hurts the child severely. OP clearly had had enough of her prioritising the dog over his safety and potentially the childs'.", "How would it be moving the goalpost? Initially that was not her first thought.\n\nAdditionally, this person agreed to take the dog for the night. Where does the dog go tomorrow? What if the dog attacks the new owner?", "Impatient?!? OP has dealt with this shit for 3-4 YEARS!!!!! Should OP just wait till the dog attacks and seriously injures their child? It doesn't matter how much longer the dog has been there. OP isn't demanding they get rid of a dog because he doesn't like it. OP is demanding that a dog that has attacked him on multiple occasions be removed from the home after trying multiple avenues of keeping the dog.", "The child is 2 months. \n\nThe aggressiveness has been increasing over the past 3-4 years.\n\nThe vet says he is in good health.", "The dog has been seeing a behavior specialist for the past 3 years at the least.\n\nTo tell you how much we\u2019ve spent on training and therapy\u2026 there was an incident a few month ago and we called the trainer\u2026 she gave us the session for free because she felt bad this was happening so close to our son being born.\n\nWe have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars in this dog.", "A dog that has attacked him multiple times and also attacked his mother whilst they were putting the kid to bed. \n\nOnce the dog bit hard enough to leave a scar they should have been put down. It might be old and they might love it, but their safety is more important. \n\nWhat happens when the dog attacks the kid?", "Yeah, how dare OP finally hit their breaking point after THREE TO FOUR YEARS of putting up with an aggressive dog?!?", ">But you were asking her to choose between you and murdering a dog. Thats a tough one. And I would find you quite repulsive a human being to want to murder a dog just because its violent towards you.\n\nI'm sorry, but wtf are you taking about. The dog is being aggressive and attacking him badly enough to leave scars and you're seriously acting like it's no big deal?\n\nMurder? Seriously, a dog that attacks and mauls and putting it down for everyone's sake to you is unjustified?! Especially with a young kid in the house?\n\nYou need to reconsider your priorities or look up dog attack victims and tell me if you still want an aggressive dog near you in your life around your loved ones.", "It didn\u2019t suddenly, it has been happening over the past 3-4 years.\n\nWe moved, got another dog in that time, and have now had a baby.\n\nWe thought maybe stress at one point too, but the trainer has been involved in between the events mentioned.\n\nThere was an incident about 2 months ago and we had the trainer come again.", "Its obvious she doesn\u2019t love her husband since the dog attacked him multiple times and she still allows a dangerous animal around her child", "Yeah, OP should just deal with a dog repeatedly attacking him. Hell, why stop there? OP should also continue to risk the safety of their child! 3-4 years of putting up with an aggressive dog that has attacked him multiple times already. \n\nTell ya what, PM the OP and offer to take the dog into your home. See how you like getting bit by an aggressive dog.", "The dog is at least 11 years old and could be losing its facilities. Op doesn't state if it's bitten his wife, he may also not know because I bet she'd hide it as it would add fuel to the fire.", "If the dog is old it can happen, not super super often but older animals get confused easily. However if his first thing was to immediately, at night, put the dog down I wouldn't be surprised if he's lying about he and the dog being fine prior. On the same note, I'd also choose the dog in that situation. To me, automatically going to \"let me take this dog to the vet now or I'm leaving you\" is such a snap decision and would make me nervous about owning any other animal with that partner. Reminds me of an ex of mine who would toss any animal that started to annoy him.", "Frankly, and I say this as a dog lover, dogs that have bitten people aggressively can be very hard to rehabilitate to the point you can responsibly find another home for them. Putting them down is very often the best option. \n\nGiven the dog was aggressive to not just him but his mother AND his wife, euthanasia is an extremely acceptable outcome.", "The dog bit him multiple times. He had every right to put it down.", "The dog IS old enough to begin to suffer age related issues, which may impacts it's behaviour. For many people a dog is a family member so just getting rid of them isn't easy.  \n\n\n>We tried multiple things including hiring an expensive trainer to help.\n\nThis doesn't sound like someone who chooses the dog over you, but more like someone who desperately wants things to work out. And when she was about to loose you, then she DID chose you over the dog. That's why I'm recommending you to really think about the reasons you want out of this marriage.", "Of course this involves their son. If the husband ends the marriage don't you think that involves the son?   I asked the husband questions, is that what he wants.    \n\n\nHowever, thank you for voicing your opinion.   Sincerely.", "It\u2019s not one incident though. It\u2019s been a slow buildup of attacks and this dog becoming more and more aggressive. They have a two month old son and the wife is not taking that into consideration at all.", "Oh I absolutely agree with you!  When a big drama is going on you protect whoever's life is about to end.  In this case it was the dog who was about to face the noose.", ">OP ending his marriage and family based on a single incident is so over the top it\u2019s unlikely to be true.\n\nExcept if you read again the dog has aggressive to him for the past 3-4 years and had been biting him. That's not one incident, that's multiple. The moment a dog gets aggressive and trainers don't help then the dog needs to be dealt with, I'm sorry but that's fact.\n\nThey have a 2 month old child in the home, with a dog that's been aggressive for years. The child comes first, no matter how long the dog had been around. And i say this as someone with dogs i love, i'd protect them with my life but aggressive is a very bad thing especially with a baby in the house. All it takes is one little moment and the dog could seriously harm the kid.", "It wasn't the first time the dog had bitten though. Trainers didn't work, nothing worked it was still attacking people. \n\nIf he left it in the house with his kid, what happens when it attacks the kid? \n\nIf you knowingly have a proven to be aggressive dog in the house, you can get into a lot of trouble. You could be sued, CPS could get involved, in some countries you can even be arrested.", "Yeah older animals can get more aggressive. It can be dementia, petting in ways that used to be ok but now hurt, several reasons. My cat bit someone for the first time a year ago when the vet touched her hips with cold hands. The vet was a little freaked until I reminded her that Artemis has arthritis in her hips and even on normal days has a little pain. Only my partner and I can touch her hips and we're really careful about it.\n\nWe have to get medication specifically for vet visits now", "Oh I know it\u2019s not easy. I just couldn\u2019t in good conscious give the dog to someone else for fear it does the same there.\n\nVet has said the dog looks in good health. \n\nThe dog tends to be more aggressive at night too.", "No really not. Its worse for the child to be in an unhappy marriage.", "So to be more specific then: in one incident he went from \u201cwe tried everything even getting a specialist trainer\u201d to \u201cget rid of your dog right now or the marriage is over\u201d", "That sounds like doggy dementia starting to assert itself. Behavioural changes at night time are fairly typical.", "Follow up question, how old is your son? Some pets really don't handle changes that well, like children coming into the family. So a rehoming to someone who don't have children could actually improve it's behaviour. Pets are complicated creatures.", "The situation still involves the child.  And perhaps aside from the dog issue they have a loving marriage.  That's why I said they both needed to go to counseling if he wants to remain married.   However you and I view it differently and that's awesome.  Thanks for the conversation!", "He is 2 months.\n\nHowever the aggressiveness has increased over the last 3-4 years. I had another post that explained it all, but it was too long to post.\n\nEssentially we moved into a house and the dog one day got aggressive and bit me on the wrists, leaving some scars.\n\nWe chalked that up to the stress of moving.\n\nLater he would stare at me and growl when I sat down on our couch, and if I got up to leave he take my spot. When I came back he would growl and show his teeth. This eventually turned into nipping at me if I tried to move him or sit down in another location.\n\nWe chalked that one up to getting another dog.\n\nThen it began happening in our bed. They had always slept with us in bed but by our feet. He bag an sleeping in my spot and would get very aggressive and nip at me when I tried to climb in bed.\n\nThis eventually turned into me having to wake my wife up if she was asleep so she could move him. And this eventually turned into him actually attacking me in my sleep one night.\n\nThis is when we got the trainer.\n\nThings improved but then out of no where he began resource hoarding. Any food he could get or you that was laying around was his.\n\nI was picking up toys they had left after playing with them one day and he runs up and nips me for taking a toy across the room off the ground.\n\nWe eventually had to separate the dogs for feedings because he would scare the other dogs so much they wouldn\u2019t eat. He broke the gate down one day we used to separate them and when I came with a leash to move him he literally lunged at me. Luckily I was able to throw something between us or he would have messed me up.\n\nI had to sit there with a barrier between us for 30 minutes because the wife was not home and I didn\u2019t have my phone. I was terrified he would attack me if I moved the barrier. The entire time he was showing his teeth and growing.\n\nIt got better for a while but then this tonight. Out of no where he just lunges at me and my mom when we were putting the kid down to sleep.", "It does sound like something happened to your dog around the time you moved and after that there's been more and more changes in your lives. Probably to much for the dog to handle. But I agree, a dog like that shouldn't be in a house with a small child. Rehoming it to someone who knows it's history and is willing to try anyways could absolutely be an option.\n\nBut giving life changing ultimatum in the heat of the moment is still not the best way to handle things. Especially not if you have a small baby with all the lack of sleep, extra hormones, extra stress on top of things. Maybe talk to a couple counseler and figure out your future. And talk it out properly. You have both a child AND several dogs. What are the rules from here on? How are you going to handle a change in behaviour from one of the dogs? But make this plan in a calm and safe environment instead when you're tired, upset, scared and angry at each other.", "I will second everything you said and your points. I feel exactly what you sad above!", "That\u2019s one of the problems. I feel like we already had that conversation and the decision was one more strike and he was gone.", "I mean talk about ALL the dogs and what to do with them if something happen. You can handle things differently when there's just adults in the house but with a baby you need a better plan. But it's up to you in the end. Do you want to end your marriage right here and now, then just do it. You will STILL need to have several conversations with your wife since you share a house, a child and dogs. But what do you want the focus on those conversations to be? Your new separate lives or a life together? What do you want? Do you want out of the marriage or not? We can't make that decision for you. I can give you a verdict and answer your question. YTA for how you handled this in the heat of the moment. I understand that you got scared, but your wife did admit she made a mistake and let a friend take the dog. But if that isn't enough for you and you're firm that it's too  late to save your marriage. Then move on."]}
