Children are a lot of work. Your wife doesn\u2019t seem to know how difficult it is because she\u2019s not the primary caretaker. It\u2019s also concerning that your wife called you weak. I\u2019d recommend couples counseling before she quits her job and you have a 2nd child.", " NTA\n\nWeak? Is English not her first language? Or is she trying to belittle you? \n\nHonestly, I wouldn\u2019t have any more children with someone who responds like that to a perfectly legitimate statement. \nHaving one kid alone is hard. Two is even more difficult. \n\nAnd if she\u2019s traveling that much and making only enough to cover daycare, I\u2019d question a lot more about her job and income. She isn\u2019t being fairly compensated.", "NTA\n\nIf you want a job with this lifestyle you don't have kids. Oh and don't get me wrong fathers that are excessively absent due to work are the same.\n\nYou seem to be doing all the parenting, housework and holding down a full time job and getting no help from her. \n\nYou are right there should be no 2nd child unless she is prepared to step down from work and step up as a mother.", "Of course she wants a second child. The first is hardly any work for her. You know your capacity. Stand your ground and don\u2019t allow insults. NTA.", "NTA.\nNot a good situation to bring another child into", "NTA.  Having kids is a two yes thing.  You are taking on most of the responsibility, and it\u2019s a lot.  It\u2019s completely fair to talk about these issues and come up with a solution.  And having one kid is an option.", "NTA - You will need to get over that she will resent you. She\u2019s always going to resent that she can\u2019t take advantage of you. I don\u2019t like that she called you weak because it speaks to an imbalanced dynamic within your relationship. Tell her that if she can\u2019t be fair then divorce and splitting custody will force her to change her work schedule anyway. There\u2019s no version of reality where she\u2019s a parent who avoids parenting.", "Absolutely NTA.\n\nIt would be exactly the same if you were the one travelling and your wife was the single parent.

As a parent of two kids, two is definitely harder that one. Given what you\u2019ve explained, the work life dynamic for the both of you doesn\u2019t sound suitable for two kids. When they are older, it gets easier but also worse when you add in homework and sports and other extracurriculars. And omg wait until they start fighting over who stole who\u2019s seat and blah blah blah. \n\nCalling you weak is really shitty, too. She needs to figure out what is most important to her. Two kids, or her career, or even her marriage.", "NTA. Raising children takes a lot of time and energy and it is completely reasonable that you don\u2019t want to have multiple kids with her current situation.

I think your wife should prioritize spending more time with her child and helping out more, especially since it is not the main source of income for your family; surely she can find something else in her field that has more reasonable hours and closer to home. I would give the same advice to a man in a similar line of work whose wife made significantly more than him and was responsible for the day to day care of a child.", "NTA\n\nQuestion - have you considered a live in nanny? Could be of great help in your situation", "NTA. I have to admit as a single mother of 3, with a demanding career, I had some trouble with your challenges but on reflection,  I've had to grow an extremely thick skin, a bloody minded attitude,  give up any time to myself, and I'm slmodt slways tired, stressed or tired and stressed. I think on reflection you're being fair and reasonable,  and that it's a hard life being all things to all people.  In fact, I think making sure you can take care of you is the most sensible thing", "It\u2019s her choice; keep her job or have another child.

My husband literally changed his job because I was doing all the parenting by myself since he was working 6am-8pm on a good day. Bad days, I wouldn\u2019t see him until the next morning. It\u2019s not feasible. I was having a terrible time before he changed to \u201cregular\u201d hours.

She or you?", "NTA", "NTA you\u2019re not asking her to have no career, just a different one with more child friendly hours.", "NTA at all, you are thinking about what is best for you as well as your child(ren). She is being prideful, and unrealistic, not to mention rude. Maybe you can suggest couples therapy if she feels strongly about a second child, so you all have help thinking through wants, responsibilities, fears, and potential resentments.", "NTA", "ESH\n\nI can understand that covering the bulk of the childcare and housework while your wife is away is a huge stressor and I think that your wife needs to be more sympathetic to that. But I think your mistake in addressing it was in telling her that her career would need to go in order to have a second child, rather than initiating a discussion where you go over what each of your boundaries and options are for growing your family. \n\nThere are options available to you other than sacrificing her career, including bringing in outside help for childcare and housework, one of you moving to part time or reducing your workload at work for a better balance, or one of you finding a different job that is better suited to raising a family. But it\u2019s unfair to tell her outright that you think she should be the one to sacrifice her career to have the family that you both claim to want.", "I get that there you are working hard to be a supportive husband and father. It\u2019s unclear from your post what compromises does your wife make today to support your career, which i find a strange omission.\n\nWhy is it that the trade off of career vs 2nd child is only your wife\u2019s responsibility? Would you be willing to work 4 days a week, and reduce household spending to match?", "I think ESH in this situation (edit: changed from NAH cause I forgot about the name calling, which is never okay). It\u2019s reasonable to feel stretched thin. Just because other single parents \u201cmanage\u201d it somehow as others have said doesn\u2019t mean you need to choose that hardship if you\u2019re not feeling it. Many people are happy with just one child. \n\nThat said, your wife clearly wants a second child and you seem to think HER career has to go. Yes, you make more money, but you could also look for a different job with less hours or find some sort of alternate compromise besides expecting the woman to be the one to drop their career. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right she pressures you either, it requires two enthusiastic consents to make any choice or one (or both!) of you could end up resenting the situation. Compromise can cause a lot of problems. Constructive collaboration to find a \u201cthird way\u201d that you both find acceptable might be a better way, but it\u2019s possible you\u2019ll never see eye to eye on this.", "So in order to have a second child she has to sacrifice something she loves.

I could only justify working at a place with such a demanding travel schedule if it breaks $100k. Anything less and honestly, it\u2019s just not worth having as a parent of a young child, much less if you want a second one. Maybe encourage to find a remote position somewhere else or just one with no travel.

My concern is it sounds like she is getting insanely underpaid if her salary is just covering \"daycare costs and little bit more\"...for this much travel and \"away time\" it doesn't make sense that she's getting paid this little...unless their child care is crazy expensive.\n\nAnother alternative is they could they not both cut down their work hours.  As a woman myself, I'm hestant to advise women to give up their career for family because i've seen how much harder it is for them to get back into the work, even if they only leave for a year. However, i think she needs re-evaulate her worth and the value of her time. \n\nDependign on their financial situation if she increases her earnings then OP can step back a bit from work.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat said, I'm questioning how much time they actually spends with the current child.
