In addition to those travel weeks, there are approximately 10 weeks per year where she is working in our city nights and weekends for 6 or 7 days per week (usually working all weekend with Monday off). So roughly half of the year she is either gone completely or working night time and weekend hours.\n\nWe have one child, and I am the primary breadwinner. Her job earns approximately 40% of what I make and her salary covers daycare costs and then a little bit. When she is out of town for work, I have full responsibility for our child aside from the 8 hours per day that he is in daycare (during which time I have to work).\n\nIt has been very hard being responsible for our child when she travels and on so many weekends. I feel like a single parent. My job is demanding, and I usually have to work after putting him down for the night, and barely have time to clean the kitchen / house, etc, on top of my job.\n\nI told her that I could support this career if we only have one child, but that if we have two (which is what we both want), that I don't think she can continue in her career. I just don't see how I can manage two kids for so many mornings - taking them both to school, daycare, events, and evenings and weekends entirely by myself, all while I am working full time.\n\nShe called me \"weak\" and said she does not want to leave her job, but said that she will in order to have a second child. I fear she will quit and then resent me which will lead to bad times for all involved.\n\nAITA?\n\nUpdate for a few who have asked: she did apologize for calling me \u201cweak\u201d immediately after she said it.\n\nAlso - she is a good mother when she is here so I don\u2019t want it to seem like she is not. \n\nThanks for all the input - glad to see I\u2019m generally not the asshole but to explain a bit further - she is doing a job that she is passionate about and highly trained for.

I think your wife should prioritize spending more time with her child and helping out more, especially since it is not the main source of income for your family; surely she can find something else in her field that has more reasonable hours and closer to home.

It\u2019s unclear from your post what compromises does your wife make today to support your career, which i find a strange omission.\n\nWhy is it that the trade off of career vs 2nd child is only your wife\u2019s responsibility? Would you be willing to work 4 days a week, and reduce household spending to match?", "I think ESH in this situation (edit: changed from NAH cause I forgot about the name calling, which is never okay).

Just because other single parents \u201cmanage\u201d it somehow as others have said doesn\u2019t mean you need to choose that hardship if you\u2019re not feeling it. Many people are happy with just one child. \n\nThat said, your wife clearly wants a second child and you seem to think HER career has to go. Yes, you make more money, but you could also look for a different job with less hours or find some sort of alternate compromise besides expecting the woman to be the one to drop their career. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right she pressures you either, it requires two enthusiastic consents to make any choice or one (or both!) of you could end up resenting the situation. Compromise can cause a lot of problems.

As a woman myself, I'm hestant to advise women to give up their career for family because i've seen how much harder it is for them to get back into the work, even if they only leave for a year.

That's not a statement about all women, it's a statement about this one woman in this one job.", "But if she's contributing nothing except income for a good portion of the year I think it does come down to the crude metric of what $ value she adds to this family.  Even if the genders were reversed I'd use the same value judgement.\n\nBut whatever. You're probably right that we need to move away from it entirely because it's used shittily in lots of ways. I see where OP is coming from though, especially in the context of having a second child.", "I agree that it's often unfairly automatically assumed that it's the mother's job that's got to be compared with childcare costs.  That's why I was careful to mention twice that this example doesn't seem to fall into that category:  besides OPs salary being 2.5x higher, and his wife's job being the one with all the away time, it sounds from the original post that his wife isn't interested in another job.", "It's not about the \"mother's\" wage. It's about the wage of the secondary earner. There is usually a comparison between childcare cost and the wage of the lesser earning parent to determine the financial effectiveness of the 2nd parent working.", "It's just because it's comparing the income to the expenses that are tied to this income happening. It's just in current society men tend to make more. When my spouse and I moved in together we measured her potential income against childcare costs. It resulted in her going to school instead of working. Now she makes more than me and the calculation of child care is put against my income. It's just really the comparison that makes sense just feels shitty when it's always the women's income it is applied to. I have seen other families that have done it the same way as us when the man makes a lower income as well.", "I think you're projecting some degree of political opinion/anger on this I'm afraid.\n\nI don't disagree with the principal of what you're saying at all, but I don't read the depth of your complaint in what he is saying.", "Holy projection, Batman. Let\u2019s pack that soapbox up for the day.", "Your feminist agenda is wrong on this one. It\u2019s not that it\u2019s mom who is working and covering the daycare. It\u2019s (example here) daycare is 2k a month and mom brings home 2200 a month. The point is that if mom quit working all together and stayed home the 200 a month that isn\u2019t going towards daycare won\u2019t be missed. Dad on the other hand brings home 10k a month and covers the 2500 mortgage, the 1k in car loans, the 700 in utilities and so forth. Here to make you feel better\u2026dad covers daycare and she covers the 2k of random bills\u2026that once she quits working dad will then begin to cover instead of daycare. That sounds more feministic for you.", "Because people assume the man is the breadwinner and the woman has the lower paid job. Sometimes it\u2019s just reality that for a lot of people childcare is almost as much as someone\u2019s wage and unfortunately a lot of the time that\u2019s still the woman. Unless it could harm your career in the long term if you\u2019re on a low wage it might seem silly to go work full time for most of it to go towards childcare and that\u2019s the case no matter the gender.", "> OP's wife can work another job with hours that allow OP to feel like he has a parenting equal. \n\nshe could but it wouldn't be a growing career, would just be a job\n\nare you familiar with the difference?", "OP\u2019s wife is living a double life with another dude and you\u2019re out here birching about gender imbalances. Get a grip. \n\nIt\u2019s about her smaller salary\u2026and the boss she\u2019s spending most of her nights with. Full stop.", "That's a good question. And I have no answer. Personally I don't want kids at all, so I cannot speak for why people want kids in any situation.

It does make me wonder - simply because I've seen this exact scenario happen to one of my best friends. He took care of her kid (wasn't even his) while she traveled internationally for work. Turns out she had a lover overseas. She and her lover are now married and have two kids of their own.", "Is the cost of the daycare that high, or is the wife\u2019s compensation that low? She\u2019s making 40% of what he makes but works way more?\n\nThis seems like something is missing, maybe they just live in a HCOL area, but then they would probably be struggling with him only making a little more than double what she did\u2026", "I just had to say that this thread has some of the best, real advice & observations I've seen in one single branch.

Just wanted to say thank you all for the thread.", "This is in many cases shortsighted, though. Kids will eventually only require before/after care, and the longer term loss of senority/difficulty getting back into the workforce will cost the family more than if they just coasted on a small loss for four or five years.", "OP\u2019s issue isn\u2019t his wife\u2019s income vs their household costs. His issue is the travel required of her job. So no, it\u2019s not really relevant. He\u2019s not asking her to give up working, just that particular job", "Because their respective earnings are irrelevant to OP\u2019s issue, which is the time he spends as a single parent due to the travel required of her job. That\u2019s the core issue here, not the income. He\u2019s not asking her to not work, he\u2019s asking her to find a job that won\u2019t have her out of the house half the year", "And you could quite possibly be taking a longer term financial hit by keeping a spouse out of the workforce during prime upward mobility years. \n\nBut at any rate, OP made it clear the issue with his wife\u2019s job is the frequency/length of travel, not the wage. He expressed no concerns about the cost, he said he (fairly) doesn\u2019t want to be a single parent", ">That\u2019s pretty dramatic to say they won\u2019t know their mother. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true.\n\nThere's still a good chance it will hurt their kids in the long run, how many people do you know who had a parent away working all the time that weren't hurt by it and where the relationship wasn't damaged by it?", "Right he was using it as an example.  His salary pays for basically everything but childcare,  hers covers childcare cost and a little more.  It better than him saying I can pay for childcare and more, she can pay for the housing, insurances and grocery bill, but not clothes, Starbucks, internet etc\u2026", "Very well said", "Yup. Projection, nothing more.", "Get that paternity test ASAP.", "Well, that escalated...", "Ha, close - I'm a uni lecturer, so better pay and conditions (still not great in various ways, but definitely better than the shit school teachers have to deal with), *if* you're lucky enough to get off the fixed-term/hourly-paid treadmill. I've been lucky, so I'm fighting for my junior colleagues (and future colleagues) not to have to deal with that treadmill.\n\nTbh, my earlier comment could describe any number of professions, though! Teachers, nurses, even doctors. Sure, doctors have at least the prospect of better once they get higher up the ladder, but to get there they have to survive an enormously exploitative system that my government is currently trying to make even worse."]}
