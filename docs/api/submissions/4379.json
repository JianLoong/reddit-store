At this time, I pay all of the bills while my partner uses his earnings to pay for his school. We agreed on this because while I was in school, he paid entirely for the apartment we were staying in.\n\nMy partner has a one specific female friend that doesn\u2019t like me, and she has made it very clear (we will call her Lisa). My partner has limited his communication with her and only sees her on special occasions because she\u2019s the spouse of one of his coworkers. Every time she\u2019s been around the 2 of us, she makes comments about how my partner could be with someone \u201clike her\u201d and that he\u2019s wasting his time on me. He immediately shuts her down and changes the topic, but I can\u2019t help but feel a little bit hurt.\n\nThat\u2019s the background of my interactions with the woman. Recently, she came over for a holiday get together that included my partners coworkers and some of mine. Lisa tagged along with her boyfriend which was fine, until she started acting out.\n\nShe called the wallpaper disgusting (the house was built in the 70\u2019s, so it\u2019s obviously not stylish now, but I don\u2019t have the budget to change it at this time). I ignored the comment, but then she started talking about the pictures we had hung on the walls and how I \u201cwasn\u2019t very photogenic\u201d. \n\nMy partner asked her to be kind and her boyfriend just laughed. Finally, she asked my partner if he really wanted to marry someone who couldn\u2019t bother to contribute to our home by at least cleaning since he pays. \n\nI looked directly at her and said \u201cLisa, I pay the mortgage and utility bills for our home. I also clean and work full time, so minor things like the wallpaper are the least of my concerns. Please respect my home. Thanks.\u201d Then I resumed the conversation I was previously having.\n\nNot even 10 minutes later, Lisa and her boyfriend left.

You do not need her in your life.", "Absolutely NTA and people like \"Lisa\" continue to get away with shit behavior because no one has the balls to stand up to them and do exactly what you did - put her in her place. Good riddance to her and her bf. They SHOULD be embarrassed to be talking trash about someone who was gracious enough to invite them to a holiday event.", "LMFAO wake up and break up. You clearly know Lisa wants your partner but don\u2019t seem to realize that his inability to cut her off and his defending of her vile behavior is a sign that he probably wants her too. NTA.", "There is no way your the asshole, lisa and ypur boyfriend are. Lisa was oblivious to how much you do and how hard you must work. your boyfriend is basically letting it slide! what is changing the topic going to do? NOTHING. you need to get your boyfriend in line and tell him how lisa\u2019s actions make you feel. i hope all works out.", "NTA\n\nI would never allow this woman in your home again and your partner is way out of line for not shutting her down immediately.", "NTA, but you are T A to yourself if you keep letting this woman disrespect you just because she wants to sleep with your partner.", "INFO: On what planet do you think your calm, reasonable, and factual statement to someone who was straight up insulting you to your face could make you an asshole?", "NTA and tbh if your partner thinks that was taking it too far and embarrassing them then I don\u2019t fully believe he\u2019s standing up for you as much as this makes it seem. \n\nThe SECOND one of my friends had the audacity to laugh at someone, much less THEIR partner just straight up middle school bullying my partner? They would have been kicked out immediately. No conversation about it, I would have grabbed their coats and shown them the door. \n\nBecause that was the most diplomatic and polite way of telling someone to fuck off I\u2019ve ever heard. If he wants something that causes a scene and embarrasses them, I\u2019m happy to provide an example of what that actually looks like so he can learn the difference.
