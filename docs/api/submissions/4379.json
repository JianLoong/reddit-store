Take this advice OP.", "Agree, so many red flags here", "Excellent question", "Thanks for asking since all I got when I looked it up was 'The Scottish Rite Hospital.'", "Yes! Sorry for the confusion! I heard once that they\u2019re engaged but they call each other bf/gf so I used spouse to broadly cover it.", "The real problem is your partner. There\u2019s no reason to be friends with someone that\u2019s treating you so disrespectfully. You don\u2019t deserve that treatment, and you shouldn\u2019t put up with her at all. She\u2019s a nasty person who is nasty to you, why tf would your husband still be friends with her? Her bf sounds like a jackass too. Your boyfriend doesn\u2019t have much respect for you if he allows her to do this. It doesn\u2019t matter that sometimes he shuts her down, he\u2019s allowing her to be around and treat you like shit. At this point she shouldn\u2019t not be in your lives."]}
