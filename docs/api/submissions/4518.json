When we met we were both looking to settle down and have kids so it felt like fate that we met. We started talking seriously about having kids around 1.5 years in, and started trying at 2 years. After three years of trying and heartache, we decided to adopt. Following a long and hard journey, we were finally able to welcome home our beautiful daughter, Sophie!\n\nMy husband was a wonderful father to Sophie, he loved holding her and being with her. He would rush to her side when he heard her cries. I couldn\u2019t have wished for a better partner and father for my children. Just after everything settled down with Sophie, we got pregnant. Both Dennis and I were elated to hear we would be having another child, and ecstatic when we found we were having another little baby girl, so close in age to her sister! But I started getting worried when I heard some of Dennis\u2019 comments as I started to show more and we got closer to birth. He once even said \u201cI can\u2019t believe we\u2019re finally having our *own* baby\u201d. I questioned what he meant by this as we have Sophie already, but he brushed it off saying I knew what he meant but didn\u2019t say it again to me. \n\nWhen I gave birth, Sophie was 11 months old and had been saying \u201cam am am\u201d whenever she stroked  my belly, so we decided to call our daughter Amy.  When we brought Amy home is when Dennis\u2019 behaviour really started to slip and lack towards Sophie. He stopped giving her attention, documenting or even caring about her milestones. He started actively trying to avoid interactions with Sophie, eg if I asked him to tend to Sophie if she were making a fuss, he would go to the cot and say that he can\u2019t as he is tending to Amy. \n\nSophie is clearly being impacted by the sudden loss of her father so once the kids were in bed tonight I asked him what is going on with him. He told me that since Amy was born, his love for Sophie has \u201cdied\u201d (he then retracted, and reworded, saying \u201cdimmed\u201d instead). I was horrified, I told him I couldn\u2019t believe what I was hearing. He tried to calm me down by saying that perhaps we could \u201csplit\u201d them, he\u2019ll take Amy and I take Sophie. It almost felt like he was making a really shitty joke. I called him a terrible person and told him he didn\u2019t deserve to be a father. I told him that I feel betrayed and repulsed by him for using one child as a trial for the next. He left the house and hasn\u2019t come home since. It\u2019s snowy here and it\u2019s getting on for 2am and I\u2019m getting worried.", "created_utc": 1670809394, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zjiihh/aita_for_telling_my_husband_he_doesnt_deserve_to/", "score": 352, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm not sure at this point if your family as a unit can be saved, but if there is any chance, it's going to hinge on major family counseling.  That his love for his child just \"dies\" because a bio child is born says to me that his version of love is incredibly limited and selfish.  Watching him dote on Amy and ignore her for the rest of her life is going to have devastating effects on poor Sophie.  You have every right to your feelings--for the sake of your children, I can only hope his heart is not as limited as it seems to be right now.", "NTA your husband scares me tbh.", "NTA\n\nI HATE to say this, but unless you want a severely traumatized Sophie, divorce might be a topic worth considering.\n\nSophie is going to be severely negatively impacted growing up and seeing the difference in how your husband treats her and Amy. If she is exposed to this everyday, I do worry for her longterm mental health. It's not healthy for her to be brought up in an environment where a parent sees her that way.\n\nI lived with a family for a time who struggled with infertility. They adopted two girls and three years later had their rainbow baby. Their love for their adopted children never \"died\" or \"diminished\" This is not normal and people should not adopt if they are incapable of loving an adopted child the same way they would a biological child. \n\nYour husband is disgusting - his attitude and comments around the matter are disgusting - and you were right to call him out on it.", "NTA but you need to figure this out asap.

Your husband is mature enough to know how his actions can hurt Sophie as well as you and your second child down the road.  Whatever he may naturally _feel_, any sane person would be shocked hearing what he actually told you.  Surely he was awake during the adoption process.  He is Sophie's Dad, her only male protector, partner to her Mother (you).  Your calling him on his behavior is appropriate, even if he didn't want to hear it and ran away.

He doesn\u2019t deserve the title of father and I hope you leave him so that both of your children have a healthy environment to grow up in.\n\nIf you stay this will severely affect Sophie. \n\nPlease look at this situation for what it is and get out.", "NTA. He accepted the responsibility of fatherhood when you two agreed to adopt. Sophie deserves a father that loves her and treats her as his own.

You don\u2019t pick which of your children you want to raise.", "NTA, and I think this might be a bigger question for a different Sub reddit.", "There is something not right with him and he needs therapy right away. I second the person that said he scares me. Me too. That is not normal behavior.  He will scar , or worse, both girls but esp Sophie if this is not fixed.", "NTA... wow, i can't even begin to imagine the shock you must be going through. To discover that you partner is the kind of person who can just stop loving an innocent human being... i would think very seriously about whether your relationship can coninue, especially for the protection of your oldest daughter. If you want to try and salvage this, please insist on very heavy therapy, because this is already he road of neglect and abuse. Also, him just leaving and letting you worry with 2 babies at home is very immature. Do you have family or friends that can take you in? I would not stay there waiting.

I\u2019m so sorry OP.", "NTA\n\nhow awful. adoptees go through so much. i can't imagine what it'd be like to get adopted because your parents were having troubles with infertility, then have having the love from ur adoptive dad dropped as soon as ur parents finally have their own bio kid. \n\nat least it isn't both parents ignoring her like it often ends up being, it's a good thing she has you. but wow. it's clear ur husband saw her as a placeholder/last resort. this will definitely affect her. \n\nthings like this happening is why adoption isn't a \"solution\" to infertility, a lot of the time the parent(s) never like seek therapy or anything for their issues and if never addressed it can lead to this/other mistreatments of their adopted kid", "NTA. OP, I second the divorce comments, and I NEVER say that, ever. But your husband\u2019s behavior is going to do deep, severe, long-term damage to your daughter. She\u2019s not something he can \u201ctry to learn\u201d to love; he has to be there 1000% or he needs to be out. Your child can\u2019t choose her father or change her home\u2014only you can protect her.

But you owe it to Sophie to get out of there. Your husband is going to traumatize her with his behavior if you stay and you will be an AH for knowingly allow that.", "NTA. You were right and he needed to hear it. Actions speak louder than words in this case--he's always said he only wants to be a good father, and yet he's proving the complete opposite true by ignoring one child in favor of the other.", "NTA. His heart must be tiny if he can only spare some love for one person. What\u2019s concerning about this isn\u2019t just what he\u2019s feeling, because maybe he can\u2019t help it and it\u2019s a process he has to go through, but the fact that he isn\u2019t horrified by it and doesn\u2019t realize how awful it is, even suggesting to split the girls. I\u2019m sorry OP, but seems like the burden of raising your daughters with the love and care they deserve will rest solely on you.", "This really should be a question for Reddit relationship advice, https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/\n\nWhat he said was horrible on so many levels.  You should look into family therapy immediately.", "Your husband is not just an asshole but disgusting.

The legacy/blood line was more important than the fatherly duties, your husband is disgusting and TA. YWBTA if you let that man influence your children with that negativity.", "NTA. I know people always say \"oh my god every post people on reddit just say divorce they're crazy\" but seriously if you stay with him, you will be showing Sophie that it's okay that she is now treated less than. You'll be saying that she *is* less than, because you're okay having a partner who doesn't love her. And you'll be showing Amy that it's okay to treat her sister poorly because she's adopted, and ruin the relationship between them. You'll do so much damage to both of them, but Sophie in particular.

However\u2026 Divorce isn\u2019t going to magically make your husband choose to be a father to Sophie or spare her the pain of abandonment. If you divorce, Sophie will still be forced to face the fact that her only father figure no longer has any interest in her. This will be reinforced every time he chooses to see Amy and not Sophie. Every birthday, Christmas\u2026 he may even choose to surrender rights to Sophie.\n\nI think a serious conversation needs to happen and therapy is needed. If he is willing to try and resolve the situation to salvage the marriage and family situation, staying might actually be the better choice, as you\u2019ll have more influence over him as his wife, rather than as an ex. He might even learn to be the father Sophie deserves. If therapy doesn\u2019t improve the situation, you can always divorce at that point.", "NTA.

They talk constantly about how grateful they are things ended up the way they did so they can have two little girls, and their girls have each other, and how perfect their family is with BOTH of them.

Your husband needs some serious counseling before he does damage to your babies. If his attitude remains, he will harm them both if he stays or goes.", "NTA.  And in all seriousness I\u2019d be looking at separating or divorce if something doesn\u2019t change and fast.  If you allow this behavior to continue you will be damaging a little girl greatly.", "YTA- but you will be is you stay with him.  He is going to destroy Sophie.  This will continue to hurt her more and more as she gets older and cause so much trauma. She is completely innocent and does not deserve to hurt or put through this.  He isn\u2019t going to just wake up and start caring about her again. And as she gets older she will see it more and understand it all.  You need to protect her it is your job to protect her.", "NTA. Divorce him and let the child support be a constant reminder that he has two daughters.", "I\u2019m adopted. Your husband sucks for saying that, and your Sophie will absolutely pick up on this behavior. To overly generalize according to my own experience/my own knowledge\u2026 \n\nThere\u2019s studies proving that adopted newborns are in emotional distress after leaving their bio families; it\u2019s suggested that abandonment issues are basically baked into you from then on.  \n\nYour kiddos will absolutely notice the disparity in attitude and treatment. There\u2019s already a possibility of her feeling lesser/threatened/unwanted by her lack of bio status\u2014 even if you do everything perfectly. With your husband already outright stating that he doesn\u2019t love her\u2026 my heart is broken for your baby girl. \n\nMy parents have always loved me. Adoption \u201cruns in the family\u201d. My brother is adopted, my father is, as is my aunt. As early as kindergarten I was worried they would suddenly not love me any more. I couldn\u2019t have had a more adoption-positive, beneficial environment to be in\u2026 and that fear is still hardwired in my soul. It\u2019s that little voice of \u2018the people who gave birth to you didn\u2019t even want you\u2026\u2019 is so insidious and hard to fight. I know it\u2019s bullshit! It\u2019s totally irrational and I feel guilty every time I think it. I\u2019ve had tons of therapy but that fear is just so deep. \n\nI don\u2019t mean to scare you\u2014 not all adopted kids are the same! Literally everyone is unique. But I know it\u2019s a common fear children have regarding adoption. What if they change their minds? What if I\u2019m not enough? Will I lose my family? \n\nDraw this line for your daughters and defend it. If he can\u2019t love both his daughters, he can\u2019t be a father to either of them. If that means he needs serious therapy or to leave the home\u2014 whatever it takes.\n\nBut to add a caveat\u2014 while this is super messed up of him, could there be some issues transitioning? Processing latent trauma from the adoption procedures? My parents were basically destroyed by the stress of adopting; I imagine the comparative straightforwardness and excitement of a pregnancy could be a stark contrast. \n\nWhich therapists did you work with during the adoption process? Can your adoption agency connect you with resources? I\u2019m assuming your approval process included lots of reading and research to prepare you on handling abandonment and bonding issues. Can you refer back to any of that? \n\nI don\u2019t know you or your family, so I obviously can\u2019t advise you what the right choice is. You describe him as an incredible father, until he had what he clearly considers to be \u2018the real thing\u2019\u2026 which seems so odd to me? Did he always feel adoption was the crappy generic? So many questions that only he can answer. Maybe therapy would help him get to the root of this and mend his relationship with Sophie. Maybe it can\u2019t. \n\nEither way. You are NTA. You have a legal, moral, ethical, emotional, social duty to protect Sophie. You promised her and possibly her bio family that you would love and care for her. As did your husband. Reminding him of that, and the dereliction of his duties as her father, is not asshole behavior. \n\nI hope your spouse makes it home safe, and you are able to find a resolution that gives both you and your girls happy lives. You sound like a wonderful mother and person. Thank you for adopting.", "Holy shit Ty our husband is deplorable. This is a divorceable offense. Either way you need to protect your children. NTA", "NTA.\n\nPack up things for you and the kids and find a safe place to stay.\n\nTime to give him a choice - marriage counseling or divorce.", "NTA! I was adopted by a single mom, who got pregnant and decided she could never love a bio child got an abortion, got cancer, lost her uterus, paniked she couldn\u2019t have kids, adopted me and then realized she could never love an adopted child. As a result, I was abused severely until I met my husband who taught me to stand up to her. A parent incapable of loving their child is dangerous and in my opinion this isn\u2019t fixable, Sophie will notice and it will damage her not only that, it will possibly build a resentment between the sisters as they get older and ruin that relationship. I normally get annoyed at people who are quick to jump to the divorce solution in Reddit but this isn\u2019t a fixable situation, it\u2019s gonna hurt your daughters especially Sophie.", "NTA, but you should speak to a lawyer on what you need to do to get full custody of BOTH girls because you\u2019re right, he doesn\u2019t deserve to be a father. To either of them.", "Sophie is in for a lifelong heartache.", "Maybe you should\u2019ve encouraged therapy first? Sounds like something is wrong. You are clearly NTA though.", "NTA.  If you're lucky, he won't be back before you call the locksmith and have the locks changed first thing in the morning.  Sophie (as well as you and Amy) deserve so much better than your husband.  Maybe give him a chance if you both go to therapy together, but only if he is an active participant in the process and makes progress.  Otherwise, he can pay support for both of his daughters and any visitation should be supervised to ensure he treats both girls equally.", "NTA but her sure is. What an awful man.", "NTA and I\u2019m so sorry for you and Sophie.  I am not sure how you can repair this in your marriage or if you should. Your husband is a AH .", "You can\u2019t let him stay around your children. Document everything he said.", "NTA. Please think about how this family dynamic will harm Sophie and Amy (and their relationship) in the long term. Your husband is not fit to be a parent. Get a great attorney and file for full custody.", "NTA. What is wrong with him? Terrible", "NTA & you need a divorce ASAP", "NTA. You're right, this guy does not deserve to be a father. Something needs to be done before there is irreparable damage is done to Sophie (and the rest of your family).", "NTA. The fact that your husband can just sever a relationship with the adopted daughter he already bonded with because he no longer considers her to really be his daughter any more makes me think there's some really worrisome mental disorder that's allowing him to flip the switch on his love of Sophie. I wouldn't trust him not to do the same to Amy down the road. Both kids need to get away from him ASAP and you need to go for full custody of both girls. I'd also make sure any custody agreement has strong legal rules requiring equal treatment of both daughters or he doesn't get to see Amy so that Sophie doesn't feel left out.", "Love for a children is limitless. With each child I have had, there was absolutely no dimming or lessening of the love I feel for each child. This guys actions and words are telling you all you need to know. He does not view your first daughter as his once the second daughter was born. He is an idiot who doesn\u2019t deserve to be allowed around any child. What happens when they get older or next week or for school recitals? He will make life hell for both girls and cause friction between the two of them for life. My two youngest daughters are close in age. I strive to make sure that they are friends now and in the future for the support they can provide each other in life. This guy is stealing a father figure from both girls and putting them against each other while sending all of you to a life time of doubt. Protect your children, both of them. I agree with the other commenters. While divorce is not my first thought or third, this guy needs to be far away from your family.", "NTA.  I'm so sorry, but if you stay married to this cruel man, it's going to hurt your daughter Sophie on so many levels, and it's going to hurt you.  Let him wallow in the snow to his heart's content.  Chain the door.  Your two daughters and their relationship, and Sophie not experiencing any further rejection, are more important than anything have to do with this man who, sadly, turns out to be utter trash.  People who hurt children deserve zero consideration from pretty much anyone.", "... Kind of worried?\n\nDoes he have life insurance?\n\nThat's snark, however, you are right to be repulsed by his disgusting behavior. I hope when he comes home has his head on straight and has equal love for both his daughters.", "NTA\nMy husband isn\u2019t our five year olds biological dad but we have 100% custody and he absolutely loves her. He treats our daughter we had together and the eldest exactly the same.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t let them be treated differently. I\u2019m so sorry for you.", "NTA. This is HORRIFYING and one of the saddest things I've read on Reddit.  He's not even shy about showing and telling you that he no longer loves your older child.  There is literally no better reason to divorce someone than this kind of cruelty to an infant.", "Let's be real here. He has every reason to feel like this. When a man truly gets their first born it can unlock a new kinda love, something he's never experienced before. So him feeling this way is normal.\n\nBut what's not right is how he's tending to Sophie. He made that decision to have her with you, and now he needs to follow through and show up for her as well.\n\nSo you're not an asshole, neither is he, trauma will be effecting him and he probably can't see what is wrong.", "He's also going to poison the relationship between sisters with blatant favoritism.", "It\u2019s either immediate therapy or save both girls from this toxicity now.  He\u2019ll crush Sophie and ruin the sister\u2019s relationship.  But honestly, therapy might just delay the inevitable - I don\u2019t know how something so awful is fixable.", "I'm just reading this and thinking if OP stays and has another child with and that child's a boy then Amy will be thrown right on the discarded pile with Sophie.", "It's shockingly common and exactly why adoption shouldn't be promoted as a solution to infertility. He clearly only agreed to the adoption because he couldn't make a biological child, didn't get proper therapy to deal with that grief and didn't assess his deeper beliefs about adoption and never intended to see his adopted daughter as equivalent to a biochild. Even OP is at risk of treating her daughters differently in subtle ways.", "And OP, remember that if he\u2019s asking to split the kids. It means he has no problem with leaving you.", "Right?", "If they divorce, at least both girls will have a safe and sane place together. But I agree with the \"what after the divorce?\" Unless he has a magical realization right now, either way, this is a nightmare for the mother and both girls.", "This is garbage.  If there was even a possibility of this happening they never should have adopted, and ops husband should have refused.  \n\nOps husband is an asshole.", "I know Reddit likes to suggest divorce a lot but consider what staying would do for Sophie\u2019s well being", "NTA your husband scares me tbh.", "This this this! Had a friend in school who was a \u2018Sophie\u2019. All her material needs were met but her emotional needs were neglected by her dad, who vastly preferred the sibling. It really messed her up and she got involved in some bad stuff by college age because she was seeking male attention elsewhere from a fairly young age. \n\nOf course she\u2019s the problem child forever now and has very little relationship with any of her family due to some of the things she pulled as a teen - but the adoptive dad was the architect of the course her adolescence took. Very antagonistic relationship with the \u2018Amy\u2019 as well, to this day as far as I know", "Exactly this, my grandfather told my father he wouldn\u2019t love me (I was adopted) anymore once he had his own child. My adoptive mother couldn\u2019t have kids due to ovarian cancer. Grandfather insisted my dad would one day cheat, have a real kid, & toss me like a discarded toy.\n\nHe died estranged from my dad. Good. People like that don\u2019t deserve any children at all.", "It\u2019s probably a reach, but I\u2019d be extra careful about keeping an eye on Amy for a while. He probably wouldn\u2019t try to take her but it\u2019s better not to allow the opportunity.", "God Bless You. \ud83d\udc4d", "100%. Very different circumstances but when I was 12 I was in a severe car wreck that almost took my life. Since then my parents have had attachment issues with me. They did not try to play favorites, but it definitely came off that way. I didn\u2019t realize it until I was much older and my brother and sister voiced their hidden resentment. Especially my brother. I\u2019d do anything to go back in time and throw us all into family therapy. \n\nI would 100% recommend couple therapy before  officially deciding on divorce. But know that his actions can impact the relationship your daughters will have with each other, and I think that should be the highest priority", "Please tell his brother why he\u2019s there. Unless you think his brother will agree.", "NTA.\n\nThis is seriously disturbing. I agree with your disgust and your assessment that he\u2019s seemingly treating your first child like she was a \u201ctrial\u201d for your second. \n\nWhile divorce is a serious option to think about, I think there is a chance your husband could stick around if he agrees to go to some serious therapy. Even then that would depend on how things go.\n\nBut with this man as he currently is, I don\u2019t feel that it is in the best interest of you or your children to have him in your lives.", "Pack his bags and have someone drop his stuff over to him. Honestly I wouldn't want him to return until some work is done on this, and maybe he doesn't return at all depending on how that goes. Therapy now, plus hard boundaries that both daughters will be loved and treated equally, or he's not welcome at all. Straight out call out his shitty attitude, in clear language, and don't let him get away with it.\n\nUnfortunately he will probably want, and fight for, access to his \"real\" daughter, but boy I hope any judge faced with a case like this rips him a new one.", "How would they know this is a possibility? You truly find that love once that child is born. Happened to me, happened to all other dads that I know, the love is intense and truly life changing", "You just said \"it happens to every dad.\"\n\nIf there was even a Shadow of a thought in ops husband's mind that he might feel stronger love for a biological child than an adopted child, he should have refused to adopt a child with op, and divorced her (which would have still made him an asshole btw. Women are more than incubators for men's sperm but at least he wouldn't have broken Sophie's heart).", "But how do they know that that's going to happen? They don't. They had no idea they could even have a baby.\n\nThey made a decision based on the fact they thought they couldn't have a baby. So why would either of them think that they would be having their own true blood child?\n\nThat's what I'm getting at. No one knew it would happen, it happened, now it's a task of adjusting to what happend, and doing right.\n\nSometimes it helps if you can understand from a different view. Doesn't mean anything that has happened is right or wrong. Big events can take time for people to adjust.\n\nI agree if he doesn't change she can leave with the kids, but then that also can bring trauma to everyone.", "That's MY point.  If they thought they couldn't have a kid, and ops husband WANTED biological kids, he should have left her and had his own kids.\n\nThe fact that he and op conceived kids is irrelevant.  \n\nThe fact that ops husband said his love for his adopted child had \"died\" shows he is immature and not ready to be a father to EITHER of his kids.", "You just won't get, so there's no point in trying to explain.", "What is there to possibly to explain?  If your love for a CHILD dies because they aren't yours biologically, you don't deserve to be a father.  Period.  The end. \ud83e\udd37", "You don't understand how someone can think they can't have kids, but then end up do having them.\n\nYou personally don't know who deserves to be a father or not, fathers have abandoned their kids and then showed up and been their for the rest of their lives, holding a strong relationship.\n\n\nYou can't grasp how love can work\n\nYou don't know what it's like when a child is born into your family and the stress it can create.\n\nYou can't grasp the this father might actually truly love Sophie, but he is just so focused on his bio daughter, maybe he needed to be told about what's going on, he can't see it if it's his blindspot. \n\nI could go on but there is no point.", "Im infertile, with a girlfriend, not a boyfriend so the prospect of me having bio children is so miniscule its laughable.  So no.  I have no concept of any of that.    \n\nIm also not selfish enough to adopt when I can't afford to take care of a child. \n\nI do actually know how the love of a father works.  I have seen the love in my dad's eyes as he looks at me, even after I came out as trans, and pansexual.  I have seen the pride in his eyes when I graduated high school, and then college.  I saw the anger, and pain in his eyes as he helped me pick up the pieces when my ex fiancee cheated on me and broke my heart.  \n\nI have watched my aunt and uncle raise their adopted children with the same love and care that my parents have shown me.  Watched my uncle shower his granddaughter with love, and joke around with my cousin's husband, and my other cousin's serious girlfriend. \n\nI might not BE a father.  But I do have examples of good fathers in my life.  And ops father is not one.  \n\nBeing blood related is NOT everything, and being blood related does not create a family. Love does."]}
