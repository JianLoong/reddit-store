When we met we were both looking to settle down and have kids so it felt like fate that we met. We started talking seriously about having kids around 1.5 years in, and started trying at 2 years. After three years of trying and heartache, we decided to adopt. Following a long and hard journey, we were finally able to welcome home our beautiful daughter, Sophie!\n\nMy husband was a wonderful father to Sophie, he loved holding her and being with her. He would rush to her side when he heard her cries. I couldn\u2019t have wished for a better partner and father for my children. Just after everything settled down with Sophie, we got pregnant. Both Dennis and I were elated to hear we would be having another child, and ecstatic when we found we were having another little baby girl, so close in age to her sister! But I started getting worried when I heard some of Dennis\u2019 comments as I started to show more and we got closer to birth. He once even said \u201cI can\u2019t believe we\u2019re finally having our *own* baby\u201d. I questioned what he meant by this as we have Sophie already, but he brushed it off saying I knew what he meant but didn\u2019t say it again to me. \n\nWhen I gave birth, Sophie was 11 months old and had been saying \u201cam am am\u201d whenever she stroked  my belly, so we decided to call our daughter Amy.  When we brought Amy home is when Dennis\u2019 behaviour really started to slip and lack towards Sophie. He stopped giving her attention, documenting or even caring about her milestones. He started actively trying to avoid interactions with Sophie, eg if I asked him to tend to Sophie if she were making a fuss, he would go to the cot and say that he can\u2019t as he is tending to Amy. \n\nSophie is clearly being impacted by the sudden loss of her father so once the kids were in bed tonight I asked him what is going on with him. He told me that since Amy was born, his love for Sophie has \u201cdied\u201d (he then retracted, and reworded, saying \u201cdimmed\u201d instead). I was horrified, I told him I couldn\u2019t believe what I was hearing. He tried to calm me down by saying that perhaps we could \u201csplit\u201d them, he\u2019ll take Amy and I take Sophie. It almost felt like he was making a really shitty joke. I called him a terrible person and told him he didn\u2019t deserve to be a father. I told him that I feel betrayed and repulsed by him for using one child as a trial for the next. He left the house and hasn\u2019t come home since. It\u2019s snowy here and it\u2019s getting on for 2am and I\u2019m getting worried.", "created_utc": 1670809394, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zjiihh/aita_for_telling_my_husband_he_doesnt_deserve_to/", "score": 62, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Don\u2019t do that to her, OP.", "Your words were harsh but I can appreciate why you said them. This is pretty alarming. And that he suggesting \u201csplitting\u201d them? WTF was that?\n\nHe may truly be struggling with some feelings but that\u2019s something you talk to a therapist about and work out\u2014you don\u2019t just start neglecting children. \n\nYou are NTA.", "NTA - I'm honestly so stunned by your husband's offer to \"split\" your children that I can't think of anything scathing enough to describe this behavior.  I'm not sure at this point if your family as a unit can be saved, but if there is any chance, it's going to hinge on major family counseling.  That his love for his child just \"dies\" because a bio child is born says to me that his version of love is incredibly limited and selfish.  Watching him dote on Amy and ignore her for the rest of her life is going to have devastating effects on poor Sophie.  You have every right to your feelings--for the sake of your children, I can only hope his heart is not as limited as it seems to be right now.", "NTA your husband scares me tbh.", "NTA\n\nI HATE to say this, but unless you want a severely traumatized Sophie, divorce might be a topic worth considering.\n\nSophie is going to be severely negatively impacted growing up and seeing the difference in how your husband treats her and Amy. If she is exposed to this everyday, I do worry for her longterm mental health. It's not healthy for her to be brought up in an environment where a parent sees her that way.\n\nI lived with a family for a time who struggled with infertility. They adopted two girls and three years later had their rainbow baby. Their love for their adopted children never \"died\" or \"diminished\" This is not normal and people should not adopt if they are incapable of loving an adopted child the same way they would a biological child. \n\nYour husband is disgusting - his attitude and comments around the matter are disgusting - and you were right to call him out on it.", "NTA but you need to figure this out asap. You don\u2019t want Sophie growing up realizing her father stopped caring about her. That little girl deserves a good life and if your husband won\u2019t give it to her then a decision needs to be made. Please update us with what happens.", "You're NTA here.  Your husband is mature enough to know how his actions can hurt Sophie as well as you and your second child down the road.  Whatever he may naturally _feel_, any sane person would be shocked hearing what he actually told you.  Surely he was awake during the adoption process.  He is Sophie's Dad, her only male protector, partner to her Mother (you).  Your calling him on his behavior is appropriate, even if he didn't want to hear it and ran away.    That he ran off and left you and both kids because you called BS on his behavior is telling.", "NTA\n\nLove should grow. It's not pie and there's enough for both children. \n\nI'm sorry you're going through this OP. But you need to think about the long term damage he's going to inflict on your girls and how to deal with it from here.\n\nYou're far from being the asshole.", "NTA - this will affect both children negatively throughout their childhood and right into adulthood. Please think of that if you choose to carry on with this man.", "First off, I\u2019m SO sorry this absolutely sucks. You are certainly NTA he is. And the fact HE SAID \u201csince Amy was born, his love for Sophie has \u201ddied\u201d. I hope everything works out for you.", "Oh wow, he is NOT a good father. He is going to scar Sophie for life with that behavior. You're 100% NTA, what sort of deranged being discards an adopted child like that? It's a WHOLE PROCESS, and just because someone has his DNA, he simply devalues the little girl you BOTH awaited for? That's absolutely unreal, he is 0% a family man.", "Nta. What a horrible thing for him to do! Adopting a child isn't something you can just fall back on. She's a human being and she deserves love and someone to care for her. \n\nKids aren't a material thing that you can just return when a newer model comes out.", "NTA\n\nIm so sorry that he has waited so long to show his true colors.\n\nHis behavior is despicable. He doesn\u2019t deserve the title of father and I hope you leave him so that both of your children have a healthy environment to grow up in.\n\nIf you stay this will severely affect Sophie. \n\nPlease look at this situation for what it is and get out.", "NTA. He accepted the responsibility of fatherhood when you two agreed to adopt. Sophie deserves a father that loves her and treats her as his own. As far as I\u2019m concerned if I were you I\u2019d tell him he\u2019s either a father to both or a father to none. You don\u2019t pick which of your children you want to raise.", "NTA, and I think this might be a bigger question for a different Sub reddit.", "There is something not right with him and he needs therapy right away. I second the person that said he scares me. Me too. That is not normal behavior.  He will scar , or worse, both girls but esp Sophie if this is not fixed.", "NTA... wow, i can't even begin to imagine the shock you must be going through. To discover that you partner is the kind of person who can just stop loving an innocent human being... i would think very seriously about whether your relationship can coninue, especially for the protection of your oldest daughter. If you want to try and salvage this, please insist on very heavy therapy, because this is already he road of neglect and abuse. Also, him just leaving and letting you worry with 2 babies at home is very immature. Do you have family or friends that can take you in? I would not stay there waiting. Get out and protect your children from this sad excuse for a parent.", "NTA because his behavior and comments are abhorrent. You\u2019re right. I\u2019m so sorry OP.", "NTA\n\nhow awful. adoptees go through so much. i can't imagine what it'd be like to get adopted because your parents were having troubles with infertility, then have having the love from ur adoptive dad dropped as soon as ur parents finally have their own bio kid. \n\nat least it isn't both parents ignoring her like it often ends up being, it's a good thing she has you. but wow. it's clear ur husband saw her as a placeholder/last resort. this will definitely affect her. \n\nthings like this happening is why adoption isn't a \"solution\" to infertility, a lot of the time the parent(s) never like seek therapy or anything for their issues and if never addressed it can lead to this/other mistreatments of their adopted kid", "NTA. OP, I second the divorce comments, and I NEVER say that, ever. But your husband\u2019s behavior is going to do deep, severe, long-term damage to your daughter. She\u2019s not something he can \u201ctry to learn\u201d to love; he has to be there 1000% or he needs to be out. Your child can\u2019t choose her father or change her home\u2014only you can protect her. Get into therapy ASAP.", "NTA, that's really sad and I honestly don't think he was kidding, he clearly wants nothing to do with Sophie", "You are totally right!\nHe is TA!!!\n\nTry to talk to his family what they think about his stance and behavior.\n\nOne can't abandon or lack of care a child just cause \"their own\" is born.\nThat is just cruel and remembers me of older generations or other assholes were the child is born as female or male and therefore a favourite princ/ess now (those stories where mothers wish for a girl after several boys or otherwise with the father and several girls before \"the golden boy\" came).\n\nThat's a hu~~~~uge red flag.", "NTA. But you owe it to Sophie to get out of there. Your husband is going to traumatize her with his behavior if you stay and you will be an AH for knowingly allow that.", "NTA. You were right and he needed to hear it. Actions speak louder than words in this case--he's always said he only wants to be a good father, and yet he's proving the complete opposite true by ignoring one child in favor of the other.", "NTA. His heart must be tiny if he can only spare some love for one person. What\u2019s concerning about this isn\u2019t just what he\u2019s feeling, because maybe he can\u2019t help it and it\u2019s a process he has to go through, but the fact that he isn\u2019t horrified by it and doesn\u2019t realize how awful it is, even suggesting to split the girls. I\u2019m sorry OP, but seems like the burden of raising your daughters with the love and care they deserve will rest solely on you.", "This really should be a question for Reddit relationship advice, https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/\n\nWhat he said was horrible on so many levels.  You should look into family therapy immediately.", "Your husband is not just an asshole but disgusting.  You will be the asshole if you stay with him, he's only going to get worse", "If Roles were reversed, how would he feel if his dad decided to not love him at all and direct all his love and attention to the biological sibling. \nYour husband sounds horrible I'm sorry.", "NTA - seems like your husband thinks of the children more like puppets or pets. The legacy/blood line was more important than the fatherly duties, your husband is disgusting and TA. YWBTA if you let that man influence your children with that negativity.", "NTA. I know people always say \"oh my god every post people on reddit just say divorce they're crazy\" but seriously if you stay with him, you will be showing Sophie that it's okay that she is now treated less than. You'll be saying that she *is* less than, because you're okay having a partner who doesn't love her. And you'll be showing Amy that it's okay to treat her sister poorly because she's adopted, and ruin the relationship between them. You'll do so much damage to both of them, but Sophie in particular. If you love your children, and I think you do, you cannot stay with him.", "NTA but this isn\u2019t something you can fix.  I\u2019m so sorry.", "NTA. I don't know what is going on in your husband's head, but both of your children are at risk from his behavior. My heart breaks for you. I don't see how your marriage can recover. I can't imagine continuing to love someone who is so cruel to an innocent child.", "NTA\n\nAnd OP? You\u2019ve got to end this. You cannot let Sophie grow up in a house where her legal parent doesn\u2019t give a crap about her and dotes on her sibling. Protect Amy and Sophie and your STBE can burn in heck.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
