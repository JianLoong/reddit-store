When we met we were both looking to settle down and have kids so it felt like fate that we met. We started talking seriously about having kids around 1.5 years in, and started trying at 2 years. After three years of trying and heartache, we decided to adopt. Following a long and hard journey, we were finally able to welcome home our beautiful daughter, Sophie!\n\nMy husband was a wonderful father to Sophie, he loved holding her and being with her. He would rush to her side when he heard her cries. I couldn\u2019t have wished for a better partner and father for my children. Just after everything settled down with Sophie, we got pregnant. Both Dennis and I were elated to hear we would be having another child, and ecstatic when we found we were having another little baby girl, so close in age to her sister! But I started getting worried when I heard some of Dennis\u2019 comments as I started to show more and we got closer to birth. He once even said \u201cI can\u2019t believe we\u2019re finally having our *own* baby\u201d. I questioned what he meant by this as we have Sophie already, but he brushed it off saying I knew what he meant but didn\u2019t say it again to me. \n\nWhen I gave birth, Sophie was 11 months old and had been saying \u201cam am am\u201d whenever she stroked  my belly, so we decided to call our daughter Amy.  When we brought Amy home is when Dennis\u2019 behaviour really started to slip and lack towards Sophie. He stopped giving her attention, documenting or even caring about her milestones. He started actively trying to avoid interactions with Sophie, eg if I asked him to tend to Sophie if she were making a fuss, he would go to the cot and say that he can\u2019t as he is tending to Amy. \n\nSophie is clearly being impacted by the sudden loss of her father so once the kids were in bed tonight I asked him what is going on with him. He told me that since Amy was born, his love for Sophie has \u201cdied\u201d (he then retracted, and reworded, saying \u201cdimmed\u201d instead). I was horrified, I told him I couldn\u2019t believe what I was hearing. He tried to calm me down by saying that perhaps we could \u201csplit\u201d them, he\u2019ll take Amy and I take Sophie. It almost felt like he was making a really shitty joke. I called him a terrible person and told him he didn\u2019t deserve to be a father. I told him that I feel betrayed and repulsed by him for using one child as a trial for the next. He left the house and hasn\u2019t come home since. It\u2019s snowy here and it\u2019s getting on for 2am and I\u2019m getting worried.", "created_utc": 1670809394, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zjiihh/aita_for_telling_my_husband_he_doesnt_deserve_to/", "score": 996, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm not sure at this point if your family as a unit can be saved, but if there is any chance, it's going to hinge on major family counseling.  That his love for his child just \"dies\" because a bio child is born says to me that his version of love is incredibly limited and selfish.  Watching him dote on Amy and ignore her for the rest of her life is going to have devastating effects on poor Sophie.  You have every right to your feelings--for the sake of your children, I can only hope his heart is not as limited as it seems to be right now.", "NTA your husband scares me tbh.", "NTA\n\nI HATE to say this, but unless you want a severely traumatized Sophie, divorce might be a topic worth considering.\n\nSophie is going to be severely negatively impacted growing up and seeing the difference in how your husband treats her and Amy. If she is exposed to this everyday, I do worry for her longterm mental health. It's not healthy for her to be brought up in an environment where a parent sees her that way.\n\nI lived with a family for a time who struggled with infertility. They adopted two girls and three years later had their rainbow baby. Their love for their adopted children never \"died\" or \"diminished\" This is not normal and people should not adopt if they are incapable of loving an adopted child the same way they would a biological child. \n\nYour husband is disgusting - his attitude and comments around the matter are disgusting - and you were right to call him out on it.", "NTA but you need to figure this out asap.

Your husband is mature enough to know how his actions can hurt Sophie as well as you and your second child down the road.  Whatever he may naturally _feel_, any sane person would be shocked hearing what he actually told you.  Surely he was awake during the adoption process.  He is Sophie's Dad, her only male protector, partner to her Mother (you).  Your calling him on his behavior is appropriate, even if he didn't want to hear it and ran away.

He doesn\u2019t deserve the title of father and I hope you leave him so that both of your children have a healthy environment to grow up in.\n\nIf you stay this will severely affect Sophie. \n\nPlease look at this situation for what it is and get out.", "NTA. He accepted the responsibility of fatherhood when you two agreed to adopt. Sophie deserves a father that loves her and treats her as his own.

You don\u2019t pick which of your children you want to raise.", "NTA, and I think this might be a bigger question for a different Sub reddit.", "There is something not right with him and he needs therapy right away. I second the person that said he scares me. Me too. That is not normal behavior.  He will scar , or worse, both girls but esp Sophie if this is not fixed.", "NTA... wow, i can't even begin to imagine the shock you must be going through. To discover that you partner is the kind of person who can just stop loving an innocent human being... i would think very seriously about whether your relationship can coninue, especially for the protection of your oldest daughter. If you want to try and salvage this, please insist on very heavy therapy, because this is already he road of neglect and abuse. Also, him just leaving and letting you worry with 2 babies at home is very immature. Do you have family or friends that can take you in? I would not stay there waiting.

I\u2019m so sorry OP.", "NTA\n\nhow awful. adoptees go through so much. i can't imagine what it'd be like to get adopted because your parents were having troubles with infertility, then have having the love from ur adoptive dad dropped as soon as ur parents finally have their own bio kid. \n\nat least it isn't both parents ignoring her like it often ends up being, it's a good thing she has you. but wow. it's clear ur husband saw her as a placeholder/last resort. this will definitely affect her. \n\nthings like this happening is why adoption isn't a \"solution\" to infertility, a lot of the time the parent(s) never like seek therapy or anything for their issues and if never addressed it can lead to this/other mistreatments of their adopted kid", "NTA. OP, I second the divorce comments, and I NEVER say that, ever. But your husband\u2019s behavior is going to do deep, severe, long-term damage to your daughter. She\u2019s not something he can \u201ctry to learn\u201d to love; he has to be there 1000% or he needs to be out. Your child can\u2019t choose her father or change her home\u2014only you can protect her.

But you owe it to Sophie to get out of there. Your husband is going to traumatize her with his behavior if you stay and you will be an AH for knowingly allow that.", "NTA. You were right and he needed to hear it. Actions speak louder than words in this case--he's always said he only wants to be a good father, and yet he's proving the complete opposite true by ignoring one child in favor of the other.", "NTA. His heart must be tiny if he can only spare some love for one person. What\u2019s concerning about this isn\u2019t just what he\u2019s feeling, because maybe he can\u2019t help it and it\u2019s a process he has to go through, but the fact that he isn\u2019t horrified by it and doesn\u2019t realize how awful it is, even suggesting to split the girls. I\u2019m sorry OP, but seems like the burden of raising your daughters with the love and care they deserve will rest solely on you.", "This really should be a question for Reddit relationship advice, https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/\n\nWhat he said was horrible on so many levels.  You should look into family therapy immediately.", "Your husband is not just an asshole but disgusting.

The legacy/blood line was more important than the fatherly duties, your husband is disgusting and TA. YWBTA if you let that man influence your children with that negativity.", "NTA. I know people always say \"oh my god every post people on reddit just say divorce they're crazy\" but seriously if you stay with him, you will be showing Sophie that it's okay that she is now treated less than. You'll be saying that she *is* less than, because you're okay having a partner who doesn't love her. And you'll be showing Amy that it's okay to treat her sister poorly because she's adopted, and ruin the relationship between them. You'll do so much damage to both of them, but Sophie in particular.

However\u2026 Divorce isn\u2019t going to magically make your husband choose to be a father to Sophie or spare her the pain of abandonment. If you divorce, Sophie will still be forced to face the fact that her only father figure no longer has any interest in her. This will be reinforced every time he chooses to see Amy and not Sophie. Every birthday, Christmas\u2026 he may even choose to surrender rights to Sophie.\n\nI think a serious conversation needs to happen and therapy is needed. If he is willing to try and resolve the situation to salvage the marriage and family situation, staying might actually be the better choice, as you\u2019ll have more influence over him as his wife, rather than as an ex. He might even learn to be the father Sophie deserves. If therapy doesn\u2019t improve the situation, you can always divorce at that point.", "NTA.

They talk constantly about how grateful they are things ended up the way they did so they can have two little girls, and their girls have each other, and how perfect their family is with BOTH of them.

Your husband sucks for saying that, and your Sophie will absolutely pick up on this behavior. To overly generalize according to my own experience/my own knowledge\u2026 \n\nThere\u2019s studies proving that adopted newborns are in emotional distress after leaving their bio families; it\u2019s suggested that abandonment issues are basically baked into you from then on.  \n\nYour kiddos will absolutely notice the disparity in attitude and treatment. There\u2019s already a possibility of her feeling lesser/threatened/unwanted by her lack of bio status\u2014 even if you do everything perfectly. With your husband already outright stating that he doesn\u2019t love her\u2026 my heart is broken for your baby girl. \n\nMy parents have always loved me. Adoption \u201cruns in the family\u201d. My brother is adopted, my father is, as is my aunt. As early as kindergarten I was worried they would suddenly not love me any more. I couldn\u2019t have had a more adoption-positive, beneficial environment to be in\u2026 and that fear is still hardwired in my soul. It\u2019s that little voice of \u2018the people who gave birth to you didn\u2019t even want you\u2026\u2019 is so insidious and hard to fight. I know it\u2019s bullshit! It\u2019s totally irrational and I feel guilty every time I think it. I\u2019ve had tons of therapy but that fear is just so deep. \n\nI don\u2019t mean to scare you\u2014 not all adopted kids are the same! Literally everyone is unique. But I know it\u2019s a common fear children have regarding adoption. What if they change their minds? What if I\u2019m not enough? Will I lose my family? \n\nDraw this line for your daughters and defend it. If he can\u2019t love both his daughters, he can\u2019t be a father to either of them. If that means he needs serious therapy or to leave the home\u2014 whatever it takes.\n\nBut to add a caveat\u2014 while this is super messed up of him, could there be some issues transitioning? Processing latent trauma from the adoption procedures? My parents were basically destroyed by the stress of adopting; I imagine the comparative straightforwardness and excitement of a pregnancy could be a stark contrast. \n\nWhich therapists did you work with during the adoption process? Can your adoption agency connect you with resources? I\u2019m assuming your approval process included lots of reading and research to prepare you on handling abandonment and bonding issues. Can you refer back to any of that? \n\nI don\u2019t know you or your family, so I obviously can\u2019t advise you what the right choice is. You describe him as an incredible father, until he had what he clearly considers to be \u2018the real thing\u2019\u2026 which seems so odd to me? Did he always feel adoption was the crappy generic? So many questions that only he can answer. Maybe therapy would help him get to the root of this and mend his relationship with Sophie. Maybe it can\u2019t. \n\nEither way. You are NTA. You have a legal, moral, ethical, emotional, social duty to protect Sophie. You promised her and possibly her bio family that you would love and care for her. As did your husband. Reminding him of that, and the dereliction of his duties as her father, is not asshole behavior. \n\nI hope your spouse makes it home safe, and you are able to find a resolution that gives both you and your girls happy lives.

A parent incapable of loving their child is dangerous and in my opinion this isn\u2019t fixable, Sophie will notice and it will damage her not only that, it will possibly build a resentment between the sisters as they get older and ruin that relationship.

Time to examine your marriage and get individual counseling. Please update us. Good luck.", "NTA it's disturbing all the things he said and the way he acted. Sophie had a loving father and now he's ignoring her. I hope you can actually leave him and get full custody of both. That kind of relationship will probably cause of a lot of ressentment toward her sister if she sees she's a second class child.", "Please take good care of Sophie OP, my heart breaks for her.", "NTA. It sounds like he needs some counseling. Otherwise you may need to seriously consider divorce. Ad I would document these conversations about Sophie.", "NTA. A lot of people are suggesting therapy before divorce, but can therapy make him love a child that he clearly doesn't? \n\nIMO, it would be better for Sophie to be in a home with one parent who is loving and present, than to be in a two-parent home, where one of the parents ignores her.", "Hopefully he got stuck in a snowbank so he'll have lots of time to consider why he's an ass. NTA.", "She\u2019s already going to feel it if OP divorced this a-hole. Amy will be going to visit her \u201cdaddy\u201d while Sophie doesn\u2019t get to. Sad", "Flat out saying 'you Sophie I'll take Amy' the biggest red flag to me. OP needs to stop worrying about where he is and start protecting *both* her kids. Because if it does come to divorce he's going to try to take Amy.", "Let\u2019s see if he reflects first before jumping straight to that. But yeah if there\u2019s no change I\u2019m on the divorce train", "And what if what he REALLY wants is a son? What are the chances he is going to ignore BOTH Sophie and Amy? Eh?", "\"Here, you take the consolation child and I'll shower our REAL child with love and affection!!!\"\n\nUnfortunately, if OP's (hopefully soon-to-be-ex) husband ever remarries and procreates, Amy will be discarded right along with Sophia.", ">And that he suggesting \u201csplitting\u201d them? WTF was that?\n\nThat was him admitting he wants a divorce.", "I completely agree that he needs to agree to immediate therapy to learn how to love or at minimum treat both girls equally or you cannot let him around them. You are NTA.", "I would not give this man the time for therapy. Who stops loving a baby? Ditch this dude OP!", "Oh he won't just crush Sophie he'll put Amy on such a pedastal that she'll be just as broken as every other golden child ends up.  Even if it's fixable do the girls deserve to suffer the damage inflicted during the time fixing it.  \n\nI honestly feel it's best parallelled to having your heating go out in the winter.  Sure you can get it fixed, but if it takes a week to a month you might still have lost some things to frostbite.  Just because it got fixed eventually doesn't reattach the lost digits.", "It might give her documentation to help strip him of custody.", "Yah when I read \u201cit\u2019s 2 am and snowy\u201d I was like I don\u2019t see a problem???", "Absolutely... This is just heartbreaking. Sending love to OP who's in a excruciating situation. Hope the best for your girls \u2764\ufe0f\n\nNTA", "I thought that too. He's just made it clear that unless he puts in work to change, he is going to neglect Sophie, even if they divorce.", "Don\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry! You\u2019re so right. I can totes picture him going after a 23yo in hopes of Dennis Jr. \n\n(The joke will be on him when it turns out this was male factor infertility and Amy was a miracle.)", "Yeah especially as a toddler he could cause some serious neglect/abandonment issues. Which is so sad because Sophie is just an innocent in all of this needing love and care.", ">This sub is often quick to recommend divorce IMO,\n\nPeople always say that r/amitheasshole \"always recommends divorce\", but in like 99% of threads where divorce is a commonly repeated recommendation, the divorce recommendation is justified.", "I'm not one to hop on the divorce bandwagon too quickly, but JFC!! A man who actually says his love for his own child has \"died\" truly shouldn't be a father. He clearly only agreed to adoption because you couldn't have your own. He definitely cannot be trusted with your older daughter, and if you cannot trust him in that, could you ever trust him with your younger child? What if his love for her \"died\" as well? Whatever else happens, this man has officially turned in his dad card and shouldn't ever be allowed to parent anyone ever.", "I mean Reddit suggest divorce a lot because mostly people come here when things are sh*tty in their relationships. Most people in healthy relationships aren\u2019t coming to Reddit for advice about it.", "I would 100% recommend couple therapy before officially deciding on divorce.", "Amy\u2019s mental health should also be a concern. Just because she\u2019s the favorite doesn\u2019t mean this poor excuse of a man won\u2019t completely mess her up mentally and emotionally.\n\nEdit: typo", "Reddit didn't even suggest divorce this time, OP's husband did.", "There are a surprising number of people who feel that suggesting divorce when abuse is occurring is somehow too extreme and just reddit over reacting.", "Very true. Most of the situations on here do warrant a divorce. Also, in the real world, lots of people stick around in shitty relationships because of  the sunk cost fallacy.", "Therapy would be a good suggestion if Dennis were the one writing the post. It would mean that Dennis was worried about his own behaviour and wanted to change. I\u2019d be pretty optimistic in that case. \n\nBut Dennis doesn\u2019t see a problem. Dennis thinks the couple in The Parent Trap had just the right idea. Dennis is, how shall I say, An Asshole Too Far.\n\nTherapy, much less couples therapy, doesn\u2019t work when you\u2019re An Asshole Too Far.\n\nOP I\u2019m sending you love through the Internet. I\u2019m wishing you and those wonderful babies a glorious asshole-free future together with lots of finger painting and cookies and sandcastles. Your love will carry all 3 of you through. Therapy might help you. Bc you\u2019re definitely NTA."]}
