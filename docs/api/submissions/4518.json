When we met we were both looking to settle down and have kids so it felt like fate that we met. We started talking seriously about having kids around 1.5 years in, and started trying at 2 years. After three years of trying and heartache, we decided to adopt. Following a long and hard journey, we were finally able to welcome home our beautiful daughter, Sophie!\n\nMy husband was a wonderful father to Sophie, he loved holding her and being with her. He would rush to her side when he heard her cries. I couldn\u2019t have wished for a better partner and father for my children. Just after everything settled down with Sophie, we got pregnant. Both Dennis and I were elated to hear we would be having another child, and ecstatic when we found we were having another little baby girl, so close in age to her sister! But I started getting worried when I heard some of Dennis\u2019 comments as I started to show more and we got closer to birth. He once even said \u201cI can\u2019t believe we\u2019re finally having our *own* baby\u201d. I questioned what he meant by this as we have Sophie already, but he brushed it off saying I knew what he meant but didn\u2019t say it again to me. \n\nWhen I gave birth, Sophie was 11 months old and had been saying \u201cam am am\u201d whenever she stroked  my belly, so we decided to call our daughter Amy.  When we brought Amy home is when Dennis\u2019 behaviour really started to slip and lack towards Sophie. He stopped giving her attention, documenting or even caring about her milestones. He started actively trying to avoid interactions with Sophie, eg if I asked him to tend to Sophie if she were making a fuss, he would go to the cot and say that he can\u2019t as he is tending to Amy. \n\nSophie is clearly being impacted by the sudden loss of her father so once the kids were in bed tonight I asked him what is going on with him. He told me that since Amy was born, his love for Sophie has \u201cdied\u201d (he then retracted, and reworded, saying \u201cdimmed\u201d instead). I was horrified, I told him I couldn\u2019t believe what I was hearing. He tried to calm me down by saying that perhaps we could \u201csplit\u201d them, he\u2019ll take Amy and I take Sophie. It almost felt like he was making a really shitty joke. I called him a terrible person and told him he didn\u2019t deserve to be a father. I told him that I feel betrayed and repulsed by him for using one child as a trial for the next. He left the house and hasn\u2019t come home since. It\u2019s snowy here and it\u2019s getting on for 2am and I\u2019m getting worried.", "created_utc": 1670809394, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zjiihh/aita_for_telling_my_husband_he_doesnt_deserve_to/", "score": 1740, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm not sure at this point if your family as a unit can be saved, but if there is any chance, it's going to hinge on major family counseling.  That his love for his child just \"dies\" because a bio child is born says to me that his version of love is incredibly limited and selfish.  Watching him dote on Amy and ignore her for the rest of her life is going to have devastating effects on poor Sophie.  You have every right to your feelings--for the sake of your children, I can only hope his heart is not as limited as it seems to be right now.", "NTA your husband scares me tbh.", "NTA\n\nI HATE to say this, but unless you want a severely traumatized Sophie, divorce might be a topic worth considering.\n\nSophie is going to be severely negatively impacted growing up and seeing the difference in how your husband treats her and Amy. If she is exposed to this everyday, I do worry for her longterm mental health. It's not healthy for her to be brought up in an environment where a parent sees her that way.\n\nI lived with a family for a time who struggled with infertility. They adopted two girls and three years later had their rainbow baby. Their love for their adopted children never \"died\" or \"diminished\" This is not normal and people should not adopt if they are incapable of loving an adopted child the same way they would a biological child. \n\nYour husband is disgusting - his attitude and comments around the matter are disgusting - and you were right to call him out on it.", "NTA but you need to figure this out asap.

Your husband is mature enough to know how his actions can hurt Sophie as well as you and your second child down the road.  Whatever he may naturally _feel_, any sane person would be shocked hearing what he actually told you.  Surely he was awake during the adoption process.  He is Sophie's Dad, her only male protector, partner to her Mother (you).  Your calling him on his behavior is appropriate, even if he didn't want to hear it and ran away.

He accepted the responsibility of fatherhood when you two agreed to adopt. Sophie deserves a father that loves her and treats her as his own.

You don\u2019t pick which of your children you want to raise.", "NTA, and I think this might be a bigger question for a different Sub reddit.", "There is something not right with him and he needs therapy right away. I second the person that said he scares me. Me too. That is not normal behavior.  He will scar , or worse, both girls but esp Sophie if this is not fixed.", "NTA... wow, i can't even begin to imagine the shock you must be going through. To discover that you partner is the kind of person who can just stop loving an innocent human being... i would think very seriously about whether your relationship can coninue, especially for the protection of your oldest daughter. If you want to try and salvage this, please insist on very heavy therapy, because this is already he road of neglect and abuse. Also, him just leaving and letting you worry with 2 babies at home is very immature. Do you have family or friends that can take you in? I would not stay there waiting.

I\u2019m so sorry OP.", "NTA\n\nhow awful. adoptees go through so much. i can't imagine what it'd be like to get adopted because your parents were having troubles with infertility, then have having the love from ur adoptive dad dropped as soon as ur parents finally have their own bio kid. \n\nat least it isn't both parents ignoring her like it often ends up being, it's a good thing she has you. but wow. it's clear ur husband saw her as a placeholder/last resort. this will definitely affect her. \n\nthings like this happening is why adoption isn't a \"solution\" to infertility, a lot of the time the parent(s) never like seek therapy or anything for their issues and if never addressed it can lead to this/other mistreatments of their adopted kid", "NTA. OP, I second the divorce comments, and I NEVER say that, ever. But your husband\u2019s behavior is going to do deep, severe, long-term damage to your daughter. She\u2019s not something he can \u201ctry to learn\u201d to love; he has to be there 1000% or he needs to be out. Your child can\u2019t choose her father or change her home\u2014only you can protect her.

But you owe it to Sophie to get out of there. Your husband is going to traumatize her with his behavior if you stay and you will be an AH for knowingly allow that.", "NTA. You were right and he needed to hear it. Actions speak louder than words in this case--he's always said he only wants to be a good father, and yet he's proving the complete opposite true by ignoring one child in favor of the other.", "NTA. His heart must be tiny if he can only spare some love for one person. What\u2019s concerning about this isn\u2019t just what he\u2019s feeling, because maybe he can\u2019t help it and it\u2019s a process he has to go through, but the fact that he isn\u2019t horrified by it and doesn\u2019t realize how awful it is, even suggesting to split the girls.

You should look into family therapy immediately.", "Your husband is not just an asshole but disgusting.

The legacy/blood line was more important than the fatherly duties, your husband is disgusting and TA. YWBTA if you let that man influence your children with that negativity.", "NTA. I know people always say \"oh my god every post people on reddit just say divorce they're crazy\" but seriously if you stay with him, you will be showing Sophie that it's okay that she is now treated less than. You'll be saying that she *is* less than, because you're okay having a partner who doesn't love her. And you'll be showing Amy that it's okay to treat her sister poorly because she's adopted, and ruin the relationship between them. You'll do so much damage to both of them, but Sophie in particular.

However\u2026 Divorce isn\u2019t going to magically make your husband choose to be a father to Sophie or spare her the pain of abandonment. If you divorce, Sophie will still be forced to face the fact that her only father figure no longer has any interest in her. This will be reinforced every time he chooses to see Amy and not Sophie. Every birthday, Christmas\u2026 he may even choose to surrender rights to Sophie.\n\nI think a serious conversation needs to happen and therapy is needed. If he is willing to try and resolve the situation to salvage the marriage and family situation, staying might actually be the better choice, as you\u2019ll have more influence over him as his wife, rather than as an ex. He might even learn to be the father Sophie deserves. If therapy doesn\u2019t improve the situation, you can always divorce at that point.", "NTA.

They talk constantly about how grateful they are things ended up the way they did so they can have two little girls, and their girls have each other, and how perfect their family is with BOTH of them.

To overly generalize according to my own experience/my own knowledge\u2026 \n\nThere\u2019s studies proving that adopted newborns are in emotional distress after leaving their bio families; it\u2019s suggested that abandonment issues are basically baked into you from then on.  \n\nYour kiddos will absolutely notice the disparity in attitude and treatment. There\u2019s already a possibility of her feeling lesser/threatened/unwanted by her lack of bio status\u2014 even if you do everything perfectly. With your husband already outright stating that he doesn\u2019t love her\u2026 my heart is broken for your baby girl. \n\nMy parents have always loved me. Adoption \u201cruns in the family\u201d. My brother is adopted, my father is, as is my aunt. As early as kindergarten I was worried they would suddenly not love me any more. I couldn\u2019t have had a more adoption-positive, beneficial environment to be in\u2026 and that fear is still hardwired in my soul. It\u2019s that little voice of \u2018the people who gave birth to you didn\u2019t even want you\u2026\u2019 is so insidious and hard to fight. I know it\u2019s bullshit! It\u2019s totally irrational and I feel guilty every time I think it. I\u2019ve had tons of therapy but that fear is just so deep. \n\nI don\u2019t mean to scare you\u2014 not all adopted kids are the same! Literally everyone is unique. But I know it\u2019s a common fear children have regarding adoption. What if they change their minds? What if I\u2019m not enough? Will I lose my family? \n\nDraw this line for your daughters and defend it. If he can\u2019t love both his daughters, he can\u2019t be a father to either of them. If that means he needs serious therapy or to leave the home\u2014 whatever it takes.\n\nBut to add a caveat\u2014 while this is super messed up of him, could there be some issues transitioning? Processing latent trauma from the adoption procedures? My parents were basically destroyed by the stress of adopting; I imagine the comparative straightforwardness and excitement of a pregnancy could be a stark contrast. \n\nWhich therapists did you work with during the adoption process? Can your adoption agency connect you with resources? I\u2019m assuming your approval process included lots of reading and research to prepare you on handling abandonment and bonding issues. Can you refer back to any of that? \n\nI don\u2019t know you or your family, so I obviously can\u2019t advise you what the right choice is. You describe him as an incredible father, until he had what he clearly considers to be \u2018the real thing\u2019\u2026 which seems so odd to me? Did he always feel adoption was the crappy generic? So many questions that only he can answer. Maybe therapy would help him get to the root of this and mend his relationship with Sophie. Maybe it can\u2019t. \n\nEither way. You are NTA. You have a legal, moral, ethical, emotional, social duty to protect Sophie. You promised her and possibly her bio family that you would love and care for her. As did your husband. Reminding him of that, and the dereliction of his duties as her father, is not asshole behavior. \n\nI hope your spouse makes it home safe, and you are able to find a resolution that gives both you and your girls happy lives.

A parent incapable of loving their child is dangerous and in my opinion this isn\u2019t fixable, Sophie will notice and it will damage her not only that, it will possibly build a resentment between the sisters as they get older and ruin that relationship.

No no no, that is so deeply heartbreaking I want to cry.", "What he said is almost irredeemably bad.\n\nAll the therapy session will do is teach him to keep the mask on in front of OP.", "I mean my knee jerk was to suggest something unkind. NGL called my partner over to complain about someone\u2019s husband because WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU DUDE?!??! \n\nThey make you WORK to obtain a kid. Like. So much work. My parents were offered and then had birth parents change their mind\u2026 five times. When my adoption went through, they had to emergency shop for supplies\u2014 they had given up hope! My dad was ready to just get a dog and give up. \n\nI have the huge packets of home studies and therapist assessments and their applications\u2026 it\u2019s such a brutal process. So for someone to just DECIDE they actually can\u2019t love the kid\u2026? \n\nHeartbreaking. I wish him an uncomfortable night with his conscience \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Thank you :)  \nEdit: adding- Not to take away from OP but I remember when I first felt tossed aside. I was no more than 5 yrs old and had to change her cloth diaper (which always hurt bc of those huge duck pins and I was a fumbling 5yr old), trying to carry her back to the living room she was teething and took a chunk out of my shoulder. I cried because it hurt and it was a big wound; my dad yelled at me, \"Well, what did you do to her?!?!\" Yes, I'm over it, I love my sister, but that's the beginning when I knew I became nothing to him.", "This is heartbreaking. My mother\u2019s parents adopted her - she was their third child. They were in a similar position to OP, they adopted their oldest child and my grandmother was pregnant with a biological child shortly after the adoption was final. They went on to adopt my mother. Adoption was never a leveller in their house. For the 1960s they were progressive adoptive parents and my mother was always theirs.\n\nI can\u2019t imagine rejecting one baby you\u2019ve come to love and do all the care for because a child has come along who shares half their DNA with you. \n\nHe should have no contact with either of the children.", "u/Supeitch is a bot.", "u/InsideComplai is a bot.", "Seriously, the kid is eleven months!  If he can give her the full narcissistic discard when she's this little, helpless, and cute, holy shit!", "Couldn\u2019t find a better word at the time. Yours is much better", "My older sister and I are 25 months apart in age. Before I was born, Maggie was the light of our father's eyes. She was also my parents' first born, having been followed by my brother 11 months later.\nMaggie had a close and loving relationship with our dad  until I came along. I was, by all reports, a beautiful baby girl (I'm still female). Once he got a look at me, she ceased to exist for him.\nI remember him taking pictures of me, but not of her. I remember him talking about my beauty and not of hers.\nIt was frankly creepy, and it marred my sister's relationship with me into adulthood. \nWe have a younger sister whom he ignored as well. She hates my guts and is obsessively jealous of me, even when it's entirely unwarranted.", "Right? Like people are specifically coming here to post about their own or someone else\u2019s bad behavior\u2026 of course that\u2019s going to mean there are a ton of posts featuring broken relationships or exceptionally shitty people and divorce is usually a reasonable option. It\u2019s not like this is \u201cAm I Too Good Of A Person?\u201d and divorce is being recommended because someone bakes their spouse cookies every weekend and treats them well.", "Yeah, I don\u2019t get when people complain that \u201cAITA tells everybody to break up!\u201d  It\u2019s like, do they not actually read the horrible toxic relationship issues that get presented here?", "Not every dad is an asshole who abandons his adopted child.", "u/Sudesetr is a bot.", "That sounds more like a brag (and some digs) than sympathetic. In case you aren't aware of that, it'd be worth examining.", "Yeah cause one side of a reddit story is for sure the way to tell someone they should get a divorce. Sad part is they let most of these morons serve on juries. Telling someone to go see a couples therapist where they can get both perspectives and not just one is a much better way to go then listening to some reddit poster say to get a divorce. Dennis probably didn't even want to adopt and agreed to it to make the wife hapy."]}
