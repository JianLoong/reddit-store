And who will house, feed and care for our generation when we can't do it ourselves, when there's too few young people? I mean, guess kids can be a bit gross at times but that's n.o.thing compared to old people! So other people's children would probably rather not whipe your behind, given a choice. No retirement?

Most people have a reason for infertility like an underlying health issue.

If someone doesn't want to deal with someone else's  bodily functions for like 4 or more years, I don't blame them, its not juvenile, its rational. if you cant handle having a kid, dont have one. also its none of the coworkers business. NTA op.", "Yep.\n\nChild free is at least in some part driven by a bunch of people who won't grow up.\n\nAll their reasons for not wanting kids is just cope for being too scared and self-absorbed.", "The coworker was rude.

And he spreads alot of mill around cause instead of keep drinking he smiles at you with the most adorable smile one can imagine. \ud83e\udd70\n\nWell long story short: seeing other people\u2019s kids and having your own kids are sometimes 2 pair of shoes. 15\u2018years I thought I shouldnt have kids and didn\u2019t want kids.

I think I even said \u2018it\u2019s not you, it\u2019s me.\u2019  I kept saying it in a soothing, calming voice, with a concerned expression on my face. She got so upset and flustered she stormed off and refused to talk to me again. And the best part is I think she was too embarrassed to complain about me. It was awesome.", "I swear other people care more about how many kids I have/want than I do.

Just because people don\u2019t outright say \u201cI\u2019m scared to have kids\u201d doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t scared to have kids. \n\nI normally don\u2019t bother arguing with child-free people because they are among some of the most closed minded individuals I have ever met. But I will caution you this since you mentioned it and it plays a large part in my conviction - you can only \u201chave a fun life\u201d for so long. (Not to say you can\u2019t have a fun life with kids, because this simply isn\u2019t true, kids are among some of the funnest things in life) But when you\u2019re old and tired, and your friends are all spending time with their families, and your partner is dead, you will just have to accept you are alone, and there is no one in life who cares for you in the way a family/children would. Inevitably, you will be alone. And if you happen to go before your partner, they will be alone. So do as you please, but just remember that.", "No, it is self-absorbed.\n\nI've seen plenty of people in the child free community who are definitely scared. Scared of what life looks like if it's different. Scared of losing who you are. Scared of not being a good parent.\n\nTons of people say \"I would be a bad mom/dad.\" Except they wouldn't be, because if they were in that situation they'd figure it out and be just fine like the thousands of generations of people that came before us.\n\nAnyway, it's your choice. I just think it's bad that childfree is a growing movement. It indicates a culture built on hedonic nihilism, which is dooms our culture to failure.\n\nThe family is the first thread in the social fabric.", "Childfree people are incapable of understanding unconditional love? Seriously? I know plenty of child free people who don\u2019t want children of their own, who pour their love into someone else\u2019s child. \n\nMaybe think about w h y someone wants to be child free first before you say they\u2019re incapable of unconditional love.
