And who will house, feed and care for our generation when we can't do it ourselves, when there's too few young people? I mean, guess kids can be a bit gross at times but that's n.o.thing compared to old people! So other people's children would probably rather not whipe your behind, given a choice. No retirement?

Combine the crying with some hysterical pointing \u201cSHE DID THIS TO ME!\u201d until HR gets involved and OP might never have to speak to this person again. \ud83d\ude02", "I so wish I had your talent . . . .", "They only want answers so they have something to counter you with. \"None of your business\" isn't something they can argue with \ud83d\ude01", "Right. Because that's exactly what I think. I'm not being sarcastic in the least.", "Just think of a really painful memory when you are talking to the person and you will tear up beautifully.", "My mom died on July 4, when I was 8. Growing up, there was always some idiot who thought he was hilarious by asking, \u201cWhat, did she get hit by a firework?\u201d \nI would usually start crying and say tearfully, \u201cYes.\u201d They always, and I mean ALWAYS tripped over themselves SO HARD to apologize & backtrack. \n\nFor the record, my mom died of a disease. Given to her by doctors, when she gave birth. But I wasn\u2019t going to let some asshole JOKE about my dead mom. Ever.", "There's a difference between \"I think kids are kinda gross\" and \"I hate children.\"\n\nLike, there's a grand canyon sized gap between those sentiments. That's not to say that OP doesn't hate kids, but that's not what she said.", "Similar but different - my coworker friend kept teasing me about dating, shortly after I was widowed. No amount of reasoning with her or telling her it made me uncomfortable made her stop. So one day after she did it again, I loudly announced that my SEX LIFE was just FINE, thanks for asking, COWORKER'S NAME. She was MORTIFIED. Damn near swallowed her tongue. I told her (loudly) that every time she brought up me dating, I was gonna assume she wanted an update on my sex life and proceed accordingly. \n\nNever happened again.", "You\u2019re awesome.", "Yes!! I am a one and done as well.  People get upset, like what I eat makes them poop.", ">OP NTA. I have kids and love them. As infants they are definitely messy goblins at times.\n\nI also have kids and love them, but the messiness does not stop once they stop being infants. I think my two-year-old is messier now than she ever was as an infant. OTOH, her five-year-old brother *really* hates messes, which doesn't actually make things better.", ">What dumbfounds them is my husband's trick.. in English hell say \"I deeply apologize,.I just don't speak one word of English\".\n\nI do that with people who want to get me to give to charity on the street lmao the fact that I don't stop moving makes it pretty perfect, they don't really have the opportunity to say 'but you just did!!!' ahahahah\n\n(Not that giving to charity is bad, but - where I'm from anyway - these are people who are paid (shittily, on commission), not volunteers, and I just generally don't like being emotionally manipulated into giving money to an organisation I know nothing about. I write the names down, and I google them afterwards! And I don't act shittily (ahah) to the workers, you don't do that kind of job if you were able to work somewhere else, but the 'sorry I don't speak English' bit is great, it's not rude, just confusing, and I can just run away ahah)", "I took a dive into cow shit, I don't need the whole having kids experience to teach me how to handle gross things :D", "Turning it around so you make them defensive, and embarrassing them, is sometimes the only way to deal with someone being intrusive. \n\nI\u2019m sorry for your loss and hope you\u2019re doing well.", "It's not really their fault, but they are gross. Yes, humans are gross in general but adults *tend to* learn to keep the gross parts hidden, while kids haven't learned that yet. I don't blame kids for being gross, but as a person who gets grossed out easily, I can barely look at that without wanting to throw up. Can't describe that any other way than gross lol", "Same here. I don't like kids, but that's not synonymous with treating them like shit. My work forces me to interact with kids at their worst moments to get them to do things they won't (I collect blood samples from them) and even though I do not like them, I try my best not to make an already bad situation worse. \n\nI love giving candy at halloween, and I can interact with children in parties and visits, but that's my limit and I won't push it.", "Thank you. It's a little lighter these days.", "Exactly. It\u2019s a limit. It is not a limitation."]}
