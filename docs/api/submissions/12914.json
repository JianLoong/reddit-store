The main focus of this story however is my allergy to tree nuts and my autism. \n\nMy sister (F11) recently had her birthday party. She made the decision to have a cake that contains tree nuts. She is very aware of my allergy.\n\nBeing 3 years older than everyone at the party meant I was just kind of standing around, with the occasional interaction or activity. I was standing on the porch watching everyone out in the yard when suddenly I see my sister and her friends sneak around the side of the house. Curious as to what was going on, I went inside to peer through the window so I could see them. Going inside was my biggest mistake.\n\nI make my way towards the window which happened to be inside the kitchen. I lean up against the counter to look out the window when I hear something from behind me,\n\n\u201cHey OP!\u201d\n\nI turned around and was quickly met with cake being flung in my face and all the girls exploding into laughter. I wiped the cake off my face and frantically start trying to wash it off my face and clothes in the sink. The sensory discomfort paired with the risk of the tree nuts inside the cake caused me to go into a meltdown. \n\nI finally got the icing off my face and I started crying. The adults, who had realized the absence of children, came inside searching for us and saw the situation. \n\nMy mom picks me up by my sleeve off the floor I crouched down onto and yanked me into the bathroom and locked the door. She began to do that whisper scream thing parents do when they\u2019re angry at you and she told me I was a major asshole for ruining my sisters cake and stealing her attention. \n\nStill being in a state of meltdown, I couldn\u2019t speak. All I could do was cry. I will not speak of what happened next assume as you please.(nothing physical, just don\u2019t wanna repeat those things)\n\nI made my way back outside to the party still upset about my now-dirty clothing and I was met with my sister and her friends berating me for ruining her party and making it all about me.\n\nStill being vulnerable from the recent meltdown I was visibly about to cry. I don\u2019t remember what happened next but I can only assume it was bad.\n\nIt\u2019s been two weeks since the party and all sorts of people are telling me I\u2019m an asshole. They say I\u2019m dramatic and I was fine since I didn\u2019t have a reaction to the cake. I\u2019m not even meant to be typing this because I\u2019m grounded for \u201cmaking my sister suffer.\u201d I feel like an asshole even though I can\u2019t see what I did wrong. I feel awful for taking away the spotlight from my sister at her own party. I don\u2019t quite know what I could have done wrong but I think I might\u2019ve. \n\nSo, AITA??", "created_utc": 1679470600, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11yazjx/aita_for_ruining_my_sisters_birthday_party_and/", "score": 98, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

NTA\n\nWho the fuck told u that you were in the wrong? Your sister brought the attention to you on her own. Imo even if you didn't have that allergy you still wouldn't be TA. This is just bullying.", "Sounds like your sibling and her friends are bullies. I wouldn't be surprised if she is pissed at you for needing more attention than her.\n\nNTA. Your sister planned it. I'd be going to hang with friends whenever her and her friends are home or it's her birthday.", "NTA, and I think you need help.  Tell a teacher or call CPS, because you are not safe at home and this is extreme emotional abuse.\n\nI think you are heroic for not running away or hitting any of the kids involved.", "NTA.  Sounds like an abusive situation.  See if you can speak about it with someone else than Reddit.  Possibly an adult confidant at school.", "NTA\n\nDid your family get to know that you did nothing about the cake, that it was they who ruined the cake against your face without your consent?\n\nAll this looks like a misunderstanding, because you clearly did nothing wrong.", "NTA that is emotional abuse, straight-up emotional abuse. There is no way of sugar coating it. You need to tell an adult you trust, like an extended family member or school counselor. Trust me, when I say that is not normal behavior, they are not supposed to treat you that way at all, both your mom and sister. No matter what they say, no matter how they say it. It's. Abuse. Please, please, please talk to a trusted adult about what happened. Ignoring a child in distress regarding anaphylactic shock is child neglect. I can't stress this enough: you did nothing wrong, your mother is being irresponsible and abusive, and your sister is undisciplined.

Your sister and her friends bullied you *knowing about your allergy and autism* and then blamed you for the predictable result and played the victim. *You* didn\u2019t take a spotlight away. *They* are the ones who intentionally caused harm. \n\nDid your parents know what they did and your perspective on this? Or have they only heard your sister\u2019s side? I know it was probably difficult, if not impossible, to explain mid-meltdown and they could have had a very different picture painted for them. \n\nNot that that\u2019s a reasonable excuse. Your entire home environment sounds toxic at best and abusive at worse (the latter if this is a common trend). You definitely shouldn\u2019t be grounded for this and idk why your parents would even allow a cake you were allergic to given how severe nut allergies can be.", "NTA pls tell an adult outside your family about this. Im so sorry this is happening to you", "NTA at all.\n\nis it always like this at home?", "NTA\n\nWhy did your parents allow your sister to have a cake with tree nuts? Depending on the severity of reaction it could have had major adverse effects.\n\nIt just seems like parents being irresponsible!", "NTA. Next time anyone says that you ruined the party, tell them SHE (your sister) ruined her own party by making it about you. She was being a little AH with her friends and back fire on her.", "NTA. Your dumb sisters did that to herself by putting the cake on your face and then laughing. It's not your fault that she drove the attention of you. Open up and tell your parents about the cake incident. If they're parental enough to understand you they'd do so. Slam your birthday cake next time at your party I'm sure your parents will shout at you for doing that.", "NTA. They are. Honey, they're abusing you. You're everybody's punching bag. Run asap. They all conspiring so you feel guilty when a part of you knows you were the wronged party. My husband had to deal with this truth in his forties.

I hope you can find safe spaces to decompress until you are able to live independent from them.", "NTA, but it sounds like your mom does not know what actually happened and maybe thinks you ruined the cake?\n\nWhen you meltdown, people have to try to piece together the situation to figure out what happened. It\u2019s not necessary obvious that you were attacked as opposed to getting into the cake on your own. When adults have to deal with these types of situations, they often become frustrated and impatient. It\u2019s not fair, but they are also people with their own limitations.\n\nHave you shown what you wrote here to your mom and asked her to please point out and explain where you did something wrong?", "Really???  Your mother  lets your sister have a cake with ingredients  you are allergic to?", "NTA. Your sister did that on purpose, and you could have been made seriously ill.

Someone at school, or a relative that isn't currently calling you an asshole.", "NTA,\n\nASD sucks doesn't it? My GF has it too.\n\nShe told me a lot about how hard growing up was: overreactions and meltdowns where always her fault. even at 23, when she finally got diagnosed, it was still her that was reacting to heavily. Like that was the point of diagnosis: Now you know what's wrong, please fix your own behaviour?\n\nKids will be kids, they probably dint think about it. Not about the nuts nor about your autism... But your mom should know better! Time she does some learning about asd, there's  no need to get angry...\n\nI wish you a lot of succes with growing up, it won't be easy at all. Both you and your family will need to learn from each other and adapt to each other.", "NTA. I hope this isn\u2019t one of those scapegoat/golden child situations because it sounds like that sort of behavior.", "NTA\nYou were assaulted. Your sister knew that cake posed a threat, and she threw it in your face. You are the victim.", "NTA.\n\nQuite frankly I would've retaliated HARD, if you're gonna be punished anyway, why not make it glorious and go down for a good reason.", "INFO: what did your sister tell your mother about what happened?\n\nEither way this is totally unacceptable behavior by your mother and as others have said, talk to a trusted adult outside of your family.", "NTA your mother failed as a parent that day. She handled it entirely wrong and if she thinks melting down is something you can just decide not to do then she's failed as a parent your whole.life because she doesn't understand the first fucking thing about your autism", "NTA. From the information provided, you did NOTHING wrong. This is, though, serious emotional abuse and flat out DANGEROUS having cake with tree nuts splatted on your face. Your sister is jealous/angry and wants all the attention on her. Sorry you are going through this abuse at home. I recommend speaking to your school\u2019s counselor/nurse who then may be able to refer you or your case to CPS. I wish you the best of luck, bless you child", "First, you are absolutely not the asshole. NTA not even a tiny bit\n\nSecond, do you have an adult in your life you can trust? A teacher, family member? Coach? Anyone? Because honey, what happened to you was assault, and what is happening now (punishment) is abuse, and I\u2019m hoping there is someone you can tell so you can be safe. \n\nYour sister and her friends intended to cause you harm. Furthermore your mother is complicit in this, frankly I judge the shit out of her for allowing the cake at all. Her getting angry and punishing you for this is abuse. \n\nPlease consider reaching out for help. You don\u2019t deserve to be treated like this", "YTA\n\nWomen are always right.
