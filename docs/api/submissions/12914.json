The main focus of this story however is my allergy to tree nuts and my autism. \n\nMy sister (F11) recently had her birthday party. She made the decision to have a cake that contains tree nuts. She is very aware of my allergy.\n\nBeing 3 years older than everyone at the party meant I was just kind of standing around, with the occasional interaction or activity. I was standing on the porch watching everyone out in the yard when suddenly I see my sister and her friends sneak around the side of the house. Curious as to what was going on, I went inside to peer through the window so I could see them. Going inside was my biggest mistake.\n\nI make my way towards the window which happened to be inside the kitchen. I lean up against the counter to look out the window when I hear something from behind me,\n\n\u201cHey OP!\u201d\n\nI turned around and was quickly met with cake being flung in my face and all the girls exploding into laughter. I wiped the cake off my face and frantically start trying to wash it off my face and clothes in the sink. The sensory discomfort paired with the risk of the tree nuts inside the cake caused me to go into a meltdown. \n\nI finally got the icing off my face and I started crying. The adults, who had realized the absence of children, came inside searching for us and saw the situation. \n\nMy mom picks me up by my sleeve off the floor I crouched down onto and yanked me into the bathroom and locked the door. She began to do that whisper scream thing parents do when they\u2019re angry at you and she told me I was a major asshole for ruining my sisters cake and stealing her attention. \n\nStill being in a state of meltdown, I couldn\u2019t speak. All I could do was cry. I will not speak of what happened next assume as you please.(nothing physical, just don\u2019t wanna repeat those things)\n\nI made my way back outside to the party still upset about my now-dirty clothing and I was met with my sister and her friends berating me for ruining her party and making it all about me.\n\nStill being vulnerable from the recent meltdown I was visibly about to cry. I don\u2019t remember what happened next but I can only assume it was bad.\n\nIt\u2019s been two weeks since the party and all sorts of people are telling me I\u2019m an asshole. They say I\u2019m dramatic and I was fine since I didn\u2019t have a reaction to the cake. I\u2019m not even meant to be typing this because I\u2019m grounded for \u201cmaking my sister suffer.\u201d I feel like an asshole even though I can\u2019t see what I did wrong. I feel awful for taking away the spotlight from my sister at her own party.

There is no way of sugar coating it. You need to tell an adult you trust, like an extended family member or school counselor. Trust me, when I say that is not normal behavior, they are not supposed to treat you that way at all, both your mom and sister. No matter what they say, no matter how they say it. It's. Abuse.

It\u2019s not necessary obvious that you were attacked as opposed to getting into the cake on your own.

Your sister is jealous/angry and wants all the attention on her. Sorry you are going through this abuse at home.

For more context; I have IBS. This manager had previously tried to write me up for bathroom usage. I had a flare up and tried to hold it and it did not work out well.

I was visibly upset having to toss my underwear and go commando but I was functioning, able to serve customers, would have been fine if she had just. NOT. But she kept needling me about what was wrong after so I finally snapped a bit.. I'll never forget the look on her face when I told her exactly what happened.

Even if it will let her \u201cget away with it\u201d that doesn\u2019t mean I need to put those awful things on the internet.", "No I\u2019ve seen the article years ago. The kid definitely died.", "All one has to do is look at your post history...", "What does my post history of 2 other things have to do with anything", "You have a post calling you sister ableist for getting upset your friend kicked her,and one where you weaponize your autism.  Apparently when you freak out its everyone else's fault.", "Im sorry do you WANT me to somehow magically control my autistic meltdowns. Oh god I wish I could do that. You have no idea how badly I wish I could control that.", "Going against the grain here...info- do you have meltdowns every time your sister has something going on? I understand you can't control them and she was very wrong but the way your mom reacted.. \nWere you warned to behave before the party or something? It's just so weird.\nAnd you didn't have a reaction even though you're allergic?\nJust wanted clarification", "NTA and honey, you are not seeing clearly because you are young and this is all you know. You are not treated right in your family.\n\nIf you did not have allergy and sensory issues, the 11 y o would still be the AH for humiliating you with the cake. The special circumstances here makes it even worse. \n\nBut your mom? This is really what gets me. Does she often miss what is really going on between her daughters? Did she really believe that you threw your own face in a cake that might hurt you?\n\nPlease try to find an adult you can trust, and ask them for advice. You need someone IRL, not just strangers on Reddit.", "This is making me upset. You\u2019re NTA at all. My son has a tree nut allergy and I\u2019d also be frantically wiping his face off if someone threw cake with nuts at him. What do they even think you did? Put cake in your own face just to ruin her party?", "First of all, NOTHING IS WRONG WITH YOU, OP!\n\nI'm (32F) autistic too and I know the feeling of a meltdown and also shutdown. I know what it's like when you want to explain yourself or the situation but the words just won't come out. The struggle of holding back the tears. The feeling of being less loved than your sibling(s) or not at all. The feeling that no one understands you.\n\nBut please listen to me! NONE of this is your fault! Please DO NOT TAKE ON THE RESPONSIBILITY for the people who failed you (as parents or as a sibling).\n\nI agree with others here saying you should look for people who truly care about you and if you can't find them, talk to a teacher you trust.\n\nAnd of course, NTA.", "How could you possibly ruin your sister\u2019s cake when someone threw it in your face???\n\nYour family is abusive. Is there anyone else you could stay with to get away from them? Someone at school you could talk to that can help get you help?\n\nI\u2019m so sorry, OP. You are NTA and I wish I could give you a big hug \u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83e\ude79", "NTA. Your sister could have killed you. Someone needs to explain that to her and your mom. Call CPS. Tell a teacher.", "I\u2019m betting sis lied about what happened.  And mom believed her.", "I didn\u2019t have a reaction bc I didn\u2019t swallow or inhale any of the nuts. It was just terrifying having something deadly that close to me. I wasn\u2019t warned specifically before the party but my mom gets really angry every time I have a meltdown (especially when my sister causes them).", "A cake that contains the OP\u2019s allergen. Nut allergies can be so severe that some people can\u2019t be in the same room. Does little sister not understand she could have *killed* OP?", "Honestly, it sounds like little sister is the golden child that likes to provoke OP into meltdowns and then stands back while OP gets all the blame for it..", "Agreed. I am reaping what was sown by my ex allowing our child to manipulate us into blaming her half-sibling for everything. They have a shit relationship now as a result.", "Why in the world would they randomly be carrying cake and slinking around like that? OP's understanding seems perfectly justified. You just seem to have a vendetta against them because of some other stuff they've done or said which is, as far as I care, irrelevant to this post. They're 14 for God's sake, and, believe it or not, people with autism don't just need to 'act more normal.'", "that's fair. Just know that if you think it's wrong to repeat it, then it was definitely wrong of her to say it to begin with. Hugs, Op.", "Regardless of their post history, freaking out over having an allergen thrown at your face -- something that can *kill people* \\-- is a perfectly reasonable response. I don't care if OP weaponized their autism or is a bad person or whatever. The response was 100% warranted with or without autism. It's fucking horrifying to have that done to you and then be blamed for them doing that to you to begin with. It is abuse, hands down. This entire situation is incredibly abusive."]}
