The main focus of this story however is my allergy to tree nuts and my autism. \n\nMy sister (F11) recently had her birthday party. She made the decision to have a cake that contains tree nuts. She is very aware of my allergy.\n\nBeing 3 years older than everyone at the party meant I was just kind of standing around, with the occasional interaction or activity. I was standing on the porch watching everyone out in the yard when suddenly I see my sister and her friends sneak around the side of the house. Curious as to what was going on, I went inside to peer through the window so I could see them. Going inside was my biggest mistake.\n\nI make my way towards the window which happened to be inside the kitchen. I lean up against the counter to look out the window when I hear something from behind me,\n\n\u201cHey OP!\u201d\n\nI turned around and was quickly met with cake being flung in my face and all the girls exploding into laughter. I wiped the cake off my face and frantically start trying to wash it off my face and clothes in the sink. The sensory discomfort paired with the risk of the tree nuts inside the cake caused me to go into a meltdown. \n\nI finally got the icing off my face and I started crying. The adults, who had realized the absence of children, came inside searching for us and saw the situation. \n\nMy mom picks me up by my sleeve off the floor I crouched down onto and yanked me into the bathroom and locked the door. She began to do that whisper scream thing parents do when they\u2019re angry at you and she told me I was a major asshole for ruining my sisters cake and stealing her attention. \n\nStill being in a state of meltdown, I couldn\u2019t speak. All I could do was cry. I will not speak of what happened next assume as you please.(nothing physical, just don\u2019t wanna repeat those things)\n\nI made my way back outside to the party still upset about my now-dirty clothing and I was met with my sister and her friends berating me for ruining her party and making it all about me.\n\nStill being vulnerable from the recent meltdown I was visibly about to cry. I don\u2019t remember what happened next but I can only assume it was bad.\n\nIt\u2019s been two weeks since the party and all sorts of people are telling me I\u2019m an asshole. They say I\u2019m dramatic and I was fine since I didn\u2019t have a reaction to the cake. I\u2019m not even meant to be typing this because I\u2019m grounded for \u201cmaking my sister suffer.\u201d I feel like an asshole even though I can\u2019t see what I did wrong. I feel awful for taking away the spotlight from my sister at her own party. I don\u2019t quite know what I could have done wrong but I think I might\u2019ve. \n\nSo, AITA??", "created_utc": 1679470600, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11yazjx/aita_for_ruining_my_sisters_birthday_party_and/", "score": 414, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

There is no way of sugar coating it. You need to tell an adult you trust, like an extended family member or school counselor. Trust me, when I say that is not normal behavior, they are not supposed to treat you that way at all, both your mom and sister. No matter what they say, no matter how they say it. It's. Abuse. Please, please, please talk to a trusted adult about what happened. Ignoring a child in distress regarding anaphylactic shock is child neglect.

It\u2019s not necessary obvious that you were attacked as opposed to getting into the cake on your own.

Your sister is jealous/angry and wants all the attention on her. Sorry you are going through this abuse at home.

I had a horrible experience at work once, and the manager who caused it wouldn't leave me alone even though I asked several times for just a couple minutes. She kept following me and talking at me while I was attempting to get shit under control; and it spiraled so badly.. I'm glad I'm not the type to lash out physically or verbally. For more context; I have IBS. This manager had previously tried to write me up for bathroom usage. I had a flare up and tried to hold it and it did not work out well. I was ashamed and disgusted with myself and so embarrased; so I rushed to clean myself up. I was visibly upset having to toss my underwear and go commando but I was functioning, able to serve customers, would have been fine if she had just. NOT. But she kept needling me about what was wrong after so I finally snapped a bit.. I'll never forget the look on her face when I told her exactly what happened.

I have a job, I drive and maintain my car as best I can, I went to pastry school and am working on getting a job as a pastry chef or chocolatier. One thing that I learned in therapy was what to do if I felt a meltdown coming or if I was getting overstimulated. I can usually tell when one is coming because my anxiety will spike and my mind starts running like gears filled with bubblegum. I can\u2019t think clearly at all because something has produced so much information input into my brain it won\u2019t work. At that point I usually remove myself from the situation that\u2019s causing it. Due to medical management of my anxiety I\u2019ve had very few meltdowns. The most recent one happened last year after about 1.5 decades of not having one.
