The night before I asked them to turn it off around 11 or 11.30 I can\u2019t remember and that was fine. He always goes to bed very late around 3am anyway. Apparently I\u2019m in the wrong as I wanted the PlayStation in our room so we could all play together but I shouldn\u2019t be allowed to boot them out when I want to go to bed and that I should go sleep in one of our children\u2019s rooms (I have a 4year old and a 7year old with him too).

If you know they play late and you all want to play together, the living room and not the bedroom is the place for this.", "Well I didn\u2019t exactly insist but it\u2019s just nice in there. We had it in the living room before but it didn\u2019t really get played on much down there. Me and my partner both play on it more in the bedroom as he doesn\u2019t like the living room TV either as it\u2019s smaller and the TV upstairs has better picture on it. I think we moved it back upstairs a couple of weeks ago as he was playing this snowboarding game lots and I wanted him to be upstairs in the bedroom with me as I get lonely haha", "We will be moving it today \ud83d\ude05", "I don\u2019t mind where the PlayStation lives, I just wanted it up here the other week as he was playing a lot of PlayStation. So that\u2019s what is argument is over me is - that I asked for it in the bedroom again so I shouldn\u2019t be able to boot them both out when I want to go to sleep. I even said to him to take it downstairs again last night if they wanted to carry on playing but he had a strop with me. I\u2019m 28 and he is 33", "We will be \ud83d\ude05 I even told him to take it back downstairs last night but he didn\u2019t", "Thank you :) well to be fair it\u2019s normally just him as his girls normally play on the PC downstairs much later in till the night but when it\u2019s both of them in the bed I\u2019m very particular about how I sleep and a light sleeper so I\u2019d rather not them chatting and laughing all night while I try sleep \ud83d\ude05 we will be moving it downstairs today so no more grumpiness between me and my partner haha!", "It was just an idea a few weeks ago I don\u2019t actually care where it goes I just wanted it in the bedroom a few weeks ago when he was playing a game a lot and he\u2019d have his head phones in which I didn\u2019t mind at all", "Haha it is immature I regret posting it now \ud83d\ude05", "Yeah normally although last night it was 2am. Sometimes it\u2019s later at 6am but he\u2019s trying to fix it. We\u2019ve been together almost 10 years and he\u2019s always been like it.

You can\u2019t have your cake and eat it too.", "I mean I would just leave it downstairs if it is an issue in the BR. Why bring it back up? \nI misread some of it. You're not wrong for wanting to boot them out to sleep. But if it's an issue the thing should be in the living room permanently.", "This whole situation sounds pretty fucking stupid.  How is this a conflict at your age? Don't you have more important shit to worry about?", "It was already set up. I don't know about yourself but mine makes it a real pain in the ass to move it from one location to another. It's really that much of a thing to have one up on your room, buy a second one for down stairs\n\n Currently YTA for gatekeeping the unit... But it seems you are fixing that mistake", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02", "Sounds like the best idea would be to move the the console to a common space instead. Then you can sleep, and they can play.", "Because he stays up too late...", "I suppose! Thank you for your input! Sometimes it\u2019s hard to know if we\u2019re being a dick or not haha", "Haha I know it\u2019s stupid and we rarely argue and because he was giving me the silent treatment and I thought I was in the right I said I\u2019ll put in on Reddit and see what they say lol. I see now I\u2019m not in the right. We will be moving it today so no more stupid disagreements lol", "Oh yeah I definitely understand why he didn\u2019t want to move it last night I just said it as I was a bit grumpy and so was he. I\u2019ll move it downstairs in a min :)", "I will be :)", "Solid choice. Will probably help with all the consternation.", "Definitely:) I feel mean that I make them both come out the room and feel guilty about it but it\u2019ll be better if it just stays in a mutual place haha"]}
