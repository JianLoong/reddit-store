{"id": 25347, "submission_id": "15zavn9", "title": "AITA for telling my (f30) husband (m30) to stop giving to his family?", "selftext": "My husband and I met in community college and got married 6 years ago. He works with AI, and I work as a part-time nurse. Obviously, he makes significantly more money than me, but we have thus far lived well below our means, to the extent that my salary alone can probably support our current lifestyle. We live in a 2 bedroom house which was given to me by my uncle as a graduation present, and while comfortable, our daughter (f 2) is getting to the age where she needs a bigger house and yard to  play in. \n\nI've been asking my husband to look into bigger homes in better neighborhoods for the past 6 months, and each time he tells me he'll look into it, and he'll sit with me looking at homes that fit what we are looking for, only to back out of it before we take the next step. Then last week, I hear him on the phone with his mom (f 63) asking if she needs more money, and if she wants more than last month on a consistent basis. His mother moved to London to live with her brothers and sisters after her husband, my husbands father, died 7 years ago. He left my mother-in-law a large sum of cash, which she spent instantly to buy a large house in London, and to move all her brothers and sisters from Iran to the United Kingdom, where they live together in a 5 bedroom home. I used to think they were each working, and/or had some left over cash from buying the home. But after I overheard them on the phone, I asked my husband how much his family needed, and if they were struggling to make ends meet. To his credit, he was very forward with me, and explained the whole scenario, detailing how they have no cash of their own, and how none of them hold a job and he's been giving them between 5-10k a month for the past 4 years.\n\nIt turns out, when they had all originally moved to London, my husbands 3 uncles (between the ages of 40-50), had held jobs as delivery drivers or whatnot, while his mother and aunt (f 50?) stayed home. Then when my husband got his new job 4 years ago, which I have now found out pays significantly more than I thought, and he started giving them money, his uncles quit their jobs and he, alone, funds them. He has given them nearly 350k in the past 4 years, which is already a lot, but for a group of 5 able-bodied adults, with a paid off home and taking full advantage of all the publicly funded benefits of the UK system, it becomes far too much in my eyes. I started telling him how his main responsibility is to his family here, and how his daughters well-being and comfort should be his priority. He said it is a priority, how he still is saving up a lot of money for our eventual move, and that he's saved up more than he's given. He said it's just delayed it by a year or two, and that we had to wait for the housing bubble to pop anyways before buying an expensive house.\n\nWe argued for a bit before he called me unreasonable and cold. I am now wondering, am I in the wrong here?\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1692812459, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15zavn9/aita_for_telling_my_f30_husband_m30_to_stop/", "score": 577, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They are disgusting. The problem is that this might be a cultural thing and your husband doesn't see anything wrong with this. Unfortunately I don't think this is a battle you can win and those people are never going to get self-sustaining if your husband keeps financing them.", "Wow absolutely NTA. His main priority should be to his immediate family, and only give what he can to them after he\u2019s made all the ends meet here. A kid needs room to run and play, and to not be able to afford to give them that is one thing, but to be able to but not because you have other priorities is wrong!", "Holy crap! $350k is a hell of a lot of money! You are not TA.", "NTA  HE LIED TO YOU.  A lie of omission, but he still purposefully hid his true income from you and never mentioned supporting his mother and her relatives.  This is borderline divorce territory.  You are supposed to be a team, and going forward, you are completely justified in demanding complete transparency with veto power over any disbursements over 500/month. (Or whatever amount you want)\n\nJust for funsies, I would visit a divorce attorney and find out how much alimony and especially child support he would be on the hook for after a split.  Considering his high income and the fact you have been married since he started working, I would guess quite a lot.  And since your uncle gave YOU the house, he would also have to factor in new lodgings for himself.  See how much he can afford to give mommy after all that.", "NTA - His uncles, aunt and mom are totally capable of working - there is no reason they shouldn't be contributing to their own living. \n\n350K is a HUGE amount of money!!! WTF? I would be livid if (a) I was just finding this out and (b) it was compromising / interfering with our own stated goals. \n\nThis should be a SHARED conversation not a one-way street where he decides. What is timeline for a home purchase? What are his plans for supporting his family - is this going to happen in perpetuity? How much is he contributing to savings? Do you have back-up savings in case he loses his job? Lots to talk about - maybe some joint financial counseling and financial advising is in order.", "You are NTA, his family is. 5 able-bodied adults who are not old or sick, should have no reason to ask for money to sustain their lifestyle, whatever that is.\n\nI urge you however to think about this: He was not forward with you. As a matter of fact, you are the last one to know, how much is your husband earning for real.   \nI'd be very concerned with this alarming behaviour. Neither you, nor your daughter do not come first for him.  Do you even have a family at all?", "Nta. He is literally supporting another family at the expense of his own (that\u2019s you)", "This made me remember a relative who used to give money to his sister and kids and whoever in his family that needed it, he kept doing it even after getting married and having his own kids, he lied to his wife about how much his salary was to keep giving money to the sister, when money or favours were needed everyone wanted only him to do it and didn't care that he already had a family to mantain too.\nHe died from the virus20 and keep his bank accounts as a secret to his wife till the end, she ended with debts from the hospital and medicines, and possibly his family had access to more money from him because one of his relatives appeared with a new car, and none of them really cares about his wife and kids like they expected him to care about theirs.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. The person making unilateral decisions and lying about their *actual* financial situation is TA here.", "He can continue supporting his mom but the uncles and aunts can get fucked imo.", "NTA.  \nOkay, so your mother-in-law decided to spend a ridiculous amount of money on a massive house, in London, then asked a bunch of family members to move in from Iran... And she then turns around and asks her son to pay for everyone else's expenses? Why exactly can't any of the 5 people living in that house start working, if they were able to work previously?  \nYour husband's priorities are all wrong. You need to tell him that his first concern should be his own child and his wife. If his mother made the mistake of living in one of the most expensive places in the world, then that is her problem. There are 5 people living in that house, and 3 of them have worked before. Your husband clearly has enough income to do so much more for his immediate family, but chooses not to due to his mother's mistake. A single person working minimum wage full time has a take home pay of \u00a31,486.61, multiply that by 3 and you have \u00a34459.83 per month. I'm not sure why your husband's mother and aunt weren't working, but I'm assuming there's a reason for that. If the house is fully paid up, no mortgage/rent, then that amount of money is enough for groceries and bills for 5 people.  \nAverage gas bills in a 5 bed house: \u00a3154.50/month  \nAverage electricity bills for a 5 bed: \u00a3136.00/month  \nAverage water bills for a 5 bed     : \u00a355.00/month  \nAvg. food bill for 4 people*1.25   : \u00a3906.25  \nTotal cost: \u00a31251.25  \nThis is affordable on a single, full-time, minimum wage salary. Universal Credit gives one \u00a3368.74/month if you're over 25. If all 5 people are getting this, that's \u00a31843.70/month, which is also enough to pay for everyone's expenses.\nHe called you \"unreasonable and cold\"? That's exactly how his mother is acting, she's basically using her own son as a piggy bank, which she doesn't need to do. With benefits, they can afford the essentials. It seems like your husbands family are simply using him to buy unneccessary luxuries. You all need to have a sit down and discuss exactly what the hell is going on, and that you need that money for your child's future, for your immediate family's future. What if you want more kids? Are they going to have to squeeze into a 2-bed whilst his mother is living large in a 5-bed in London?", "NTA... So NTA", "NTA - I would be absolutely livid.  You\u2019re married and that is your shared money as a family.  Big purchases or spend needs to be discussed and agreed upon.  It\u2019s ok to help family out once in a while but not when it\u2019s avoidable (them working) and not at the expense of your own family\u2019s needs first. Don\u2019t feel you don\u2019t have a say in the way he spends your collective money - even if you didn\u2019t provide the starter home.  This situation and amount is outrageous!  He is blatantly telling you that you and your child come 6th and 7th on his priority list.  I don\u2019t care what culture it is, he\u2019s doing it to impress and needs to tuck that machismo away because it\u2019s not doing anyone long term favours.  40-50 year olds need to be working extra hard to save for retirement if they have no savings.  Careful that you\u2019re not left high and dry.  His actions and secrecy are unreasonable and cold towards you.", "NTA\n\nHe is supporting 5 able bodied adults?  They should be ashamed of taking advantage of the young man!  Shame on them for taking when his own wife and child are going without!", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGet a divorce and sue him for child support. He is an AH.", "He should be supporting you because you are now family and his main focus should be on you, not his family. NTA.", "NTA\n\nIn 4 years he could have paid off most if not all of the costs of a home for you three if you\u2019re in the USA, at the USAs average. It could also pay for several college degrees, even at places like Harvard. \n\nHis family is taking advantage of him and he doesn\u2019t even realize it. Does he have a college fund for your daughter? Or is the mooching family in another country taking too much. They need to support themselves.", "NTA if he thought it was so okay to be sending a large sum of money every month, Why did he hide it?", "NTA and that would be an instant divorce from my part... he lied to you about his salary and he's been giving them 5-10k each month without you knowing?!?!", "NTA. Your husband does his family no favors as he is turning them into a bunch of mooches. You should consider divorcing him because you are not a priority to him, no will any future children be either. The two of you are not anywhere near being on the same financial page. Is he going to expect any future children take over the ATM role for his family when he no longer support everyone?\n\nThere is no excuse for able body adults to not work.\n\nETA. I would insist that he set a deadline for the leeches to get jobs and become self sufficient or you will leave.", "NTA thems grounds for divorce right there. Hiding over 350k in spending?? Holy heck I am sorry you are dealing with such a bad husband problem.", "Woah, I thought you were gonna say a couple hundred dollars, but that's too much NTA", "NTA.  Nope,  if he wants to support them then he can leave and go move in with them.  They are taking full advantage and what is his plan? Support all of them for the next 30 years?!?", "NAH. If he's saved up more than he's given, then he's saved up more than 350K. It's culturally appropriate for your husband to be supporting his mother and family, and it's understandable if it was hard for them to suddenly come from living very different lives to having to be delivery drivers. But it's also understandable for you to feel really betrayed at not being told about this because it absolutely impacts your finances. Your husband is right that it's not a good time to buy right now and you should wait a year or two until the market calms down, but he should have been giving you all the facts and telling you about it from the beginning.", "YTA \n\nYou don't get to just tell him what to do. It's rude to do so. \n\nHe has been honest with you and now you have to be honest with him. You agree with helping but not fully supporting the young uncles for example. \n\nHe should be helping them develop an action plan so that they can earn on their own and eventually support themselves should your mom decide to move or sell. She clearly doesn't need such a large home. \n\nHe is dealing with something you are not familiar with in terms of both a family that supports each other and doesn't necessarily view financial support as different than emotional support - many cultures view finances as familial - and also - coming from somewhere with a lot of poverty and limited opportunities if you aren't highly educated, they may simply not have much of a concept of how to go about this and what they should aspire to. Obv being delivery drivers doesn't seem like a solution bc - as most places - these jobs don't really pay enough to realistically support yourself. \n\nOf course he doesn't want to support them more than he has to but it is entirely normal that he would refuse to simply cut them off and let them fend for themselves. Family is much stronger and isn't just immediate nuclear family in many cultures. So you need to recalibrate your gauge of what you would do or see your peers do. \n\nSo many immigrants all over send money home bc it's simply what you do. Help your family. \n\nJust saying this so you realize you are approaching this from a decidedly limited lens that isn't going to do your husband or your relationship any favours. You need to adjust your vision bc you have married into another culture. Your goals for your immediate family are fine but you cannot expect him to just turn his back on his OG family bc it's not what you are used to.", "NAH, because it doesn\u2019t sound like the husband would have bought a house yet anyway since over inflated home prices Also I have a friend who\u2019s parents and family are from Iran, the situation some of these people have been in is horrific, many don\u2019t talk about it, the husband could just want his family to have a bit of luxury as they\u2019re older", "NAH, except maybe his family. However, they are still his family, and he wants to make sure they are taken care of. And he's not wrong about wanting to wait for the housing market to level out a little. Your concerns are also perfectly valid.\n\nSounds like you two need to have a longer discussion about money coming in and where it's going. But it's a safe bet he will want to continue giving money to his mom. Maybe discuss limiting it to no more than $5k a month.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Would they have the audacity to think that you should continue your husband's generosity at cost to yourself.\n\nFurthermore, based on the way he's gone about doing things, this situation should be a hill to die on and possibly marriage ending.

However you should have been more in touch with the finances before this point.

Most licenses and sometimes degrees do not transfer between countries. His uncle could have been a doctor in Iran but cannot practice medicine in the UK without more schooling or applying for a new license to practice. He may need to fill some education/experience gaps because the UK has more requirements than Iran so they likely won\u2019t honor an Iranian doctor\u2019s degree/experience. So they unfortunately do need to rely on the Government handouts and your husband until that can get sorted.

Why not?\n\nThis whole thing reeks of a lack of communication, honesty, assumptions, and different cultural expectations. They aren\u2019t just his family. They are your family too. Just as your family is his family now. Perhaps you should start sending money to your parents too. Or at least have the discussion with your husband about how he would feel about you doing that. Also you need to discuss those hidden expectations and timelines. What are your major life goals? What are his? What are the goals of the family as a whole?

If your lives haven't been dangerously effected, as in unable to buy food and/or pay bills, then the level of giving is probably forgivable but still should probably be reduced or stopped.

He probably thought, reasonably, that is everything at home was paid for, he was still able to put money into your savings, and it wasn't interfering in your home buying plans, that it was okay to send the extra money to his family.\n\nYou both need to talk to each other about what you're making as a household, what your bills are, what your saving goals are for the house, and how to divide what's left.

But we do it as 10% of our income as a type of tithe. \nYou are living in your home left to you and you need a bigger home but can't because he gave away the amount to buy a house to support people who can support themselves.

They should be declaring those amounts. I hope they get caught. It can mean prison sentences and they could be deported.", "NTA by a long shot. The husband should be safeguarding his wife, child and his wifes futures before considering helping others. The fact he's not willing to sort out a new home for his child and wife means he has his priorities wrong on this front.\n\nThe more pressing matter that I haven't seen anyone else mention here that is a big issue is OP mentions that the uncles and other relatives are availing themselves of the state benefits available to them whilst living in the UK, all the while taking thousands of pounds from OP's husband - That is fraud at a simple level. The DWP (Department for Work and Pensions in the UK) would consider the those various claims for universal Credit and other state support (who knows, are they also claiming housing beneift for a house that is completely paid off?) whilst getting help from family memebers to the level they are as fradulent claims due to the amount of money being supplied by OP's husband. If they find out, and they likely will (likely spending well above their means if they were only financed by what DWP pay them) then they could find themselves in court facing a judge and possible jail time. It only takes a neighbour making a phone call to the DWP fraud hotline to report things they are seeing and that no-one in the house works but are spending vast sums of unaccoutable money that could land DWP investigators and even the police on the doorstep.  \n\nOP's husbands family are the reason why benefit claimants in the UK have such as hard time, seen as scroungers and layabouts claiming off the state - benefits are supposed to be a safety net support system needed for when somebody is on their knees needing help - not in situations like OP's family.  it wouldn't be an issue for me if they were just being supported by OP's husband as that's a family matter, but they are essentially stealing from the state and should be found out and punished for it.\n\nFor the good of OP's mother's health, OP's husband needs to cut the rest of the family off NOW. Send some money to the elderly mother for upkeep if he must, but nothing like the amounts he's been sending for the others in the household to protect them from a fruad claim and possible jail time and to protect his elederly mothers health (from stress of any potential legal issues stemming from the illegitamate claims for state support)", "Yta if he makes enough to support both homes and his family means that much to him you should understand that.

Helping out family is very respectable. But enabling family is just a waste of money, because they are doing nothing to better their situation. I'm sorry, but you married into a family of leeches.", "NTA at all.  That's a huge amount of money that's essentially supporting his adult siblings.\n\nMaybe the house needs to be sold, and you and your husband buy a bigger place and move his mom into there (seeing as you say she's a kind hearted woman) and let his brothers get a job and find somewhere else to live.", "NTA, that is a LOT of money to be sending without you being made aware of it.\n\nI would understand if he was putting some money into an account for his mom and her alone, but that's a high amount and he's sending the money for all his mom's siblings as well, which is ridiculous. \n\nWhat I think would be fair is to continue to send money for HIS MOM and her alone, but not as much, and the rest of the money he'd usually spend be put into an account for your daughter. Like if she decides to go to college or she'll have money for her own place by the time she's old enough. Waiting a bit longer for a new house isn't the issue I don't think, it's the fact he's been dishonest by omission. Sure he hasn't been \"lying\" in the traditional sense, but you were obviously not made aware of this from the get-go. As spouses you should be able to communicate where money goes. Yes it's money he's making, but by not being open about big spends or even how much he's making, it's not a good look.\n\nI think there's two extremes here where a compromise in the middle could be made. I think fully halting the money isn't a good idea, but meeting in the middle and making it clear that him wanting to help his mom is sweet and really good, but there's such a thing as too much and when it impacts your family, it's too much. This is stopping you from buying a better home for your kid. If some of that money was going into an interest building account for your kid? Then the wait would be worth it. If you already have an account like that, then saving that money towards your home and all the things that come with that (potential repairs and renovations, new furniture, etc) is a great idea.\n\nWanting housing prices to drop more is a smart move, things will probably crash in many areas soon enough, but he has to put especially his child first.", "Do these uncles have permission to work in the UK?", "Wow thank you for this.

And so are you.\n\nI would go absolutely nuclear if I were in your situation. I would not allow my husband to be in charge of finances anymore. No automatic withdrawals of any kind. Find out what his actual salary is and ensure that the whole thing comes into *your* account. Any expense over $500 requires approval from both of you. He can give his mom $1,000-2,000 a month which is more than enough for her to survive on.", "I dont fully know their situation. I know for a fact they get free healthcare, and I think they get the basic income, but I spoke prematurely on that front, as I could be wrong. I dont know how the UK system works, but I hope my husband wouldnt be so juvenile as to not educate them on such things.", "I like to think its not like that, and that he's just too kind for his own good.

It\u2019s possible they\u2019re spending every penny they\u2019ve been sent, but if they\u2019re getting the universal income, and they\u2019re stashing money, they could lose it. It\u2019s not a lot of money, but if they\u2019re lying about anything to get benefits, they could get in trouble. \n\nAlso, the government is trying to cut back on benefits, so my guess is they would be likely to investigate people with an address in a higher income neighborhood, especially if they\u2019re immigrants. But that\u2019s just a guess. \n\nHas he shown you the bank records? I would demand to see them, as well as get online access. You will need it anyway is something happens to your husband.

Open up a PO Box and have the transcripts sent there. I bet that one of the reasons he\u2019s so secretive about the new house is that you would need to finance part of it and a loan application would require him to provide full financials and tax return copies.) If he\u2019s been filing a separate return, that would be grounds for divorce right there as he\u2019s not only hiding income from you, but paying way more in taxes that if you were filing joint.", "His mom is 63, and his aunt isn't 60 yet? They can both work. No, they won't be the most glamorous jobs in the world, but they'll be able to contribute to their own subsistence instead of leeching off y'all. Remember that his mother blew through the money left by her husband \u2014 she bought a big house in one of the most expensive cities in the world. This is not someone you can trust to be wise with money.\n\nBut the most important thing to remember here is that your husband has been lying to you. He lied about how much he makes \u2014 what the fuck is up with that?\n\nThere's no good answer here because he may not be willing to cut off these parasites, but everybody who isn't legit disabled can work until they're 65 or 70. Frankly, you should cut them off but we know that isn't going to happen.

There's confusion in the comments about where OP is located so which currency to use, but shows that at least they aren't in the UK themselves.\n\nIt's a lot of money and doesn't really change the husband being TA here, but it can really put into perspective just how ludicrous the amount the 1% is earning compared to even the 10%.", "The part that is most annoying to me is that his family here in the UK are apparently claiming benefits (possibly for being out of work).  When they\u2019re actually being subsidised so heavily and comfortably that they\u2019ve all quit their jobs with zero worry. It\u2019s seriously offensive.

That is a need, not a want. \nWhatever his culture is, it doesn't give him the right to lie to his wife and make choices for his family by himself. If he could afford both buying a house and supporting 4 extended family members, it wouldn't be impacting his family and wouldn't be an issue. But since it does impact his family, he is in the wrong.\n\nOPs culture doesn't care only about nuclear family, but it is more important than extended family, yes. Precisely why her husband should have been very transparent from the start and explain how much money he intends to send to his family and why and ask her for her consent and opinion.\n\nI am curious for how long he intends to support them like that? His uncles seem to be not much older than him and will live 20-40 more years, they could even outlive OPs husband. What's his long term plan?

Worst part is, sounds like she'd have been okay with him sending money to just his mom, or even just less money for all of them, but he didn't even discuss it.
