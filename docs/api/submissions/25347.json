{"id": 25347, "submission_id": "15zavn9", "title": "AITA for telling my (f30) husband (m30) to stop giving to his family?", "selftext": "My husband and I met in community college and got married 6 years ago. He works with AI, and I work as a part-time nurse. Obviously, he makes significantly more money than me, but we have thus far lived well below our means, to the extent that my salary alone can probably support our current lifestyle. We live in a 2 bedroom house which was given to me by my uncle as a graduation present, and while comfortable, our daughter (f 2) is getting to the age where she needs a bigger house and yard to  play in. \n\nI've been asking my husband to look into bigger homes in better neighborhoods for the past 6 months, and each time he tells me he'll look into it, and he'll sit with me looking at homes that fit what we are looking for, only to back out of it before we take the next step. Then last week, I hear him on the phone with his mom (f 63) asking if she needs more money, and if she wants more than last month on a consistent basis. His mother moved to London to live with her brothers and sisters after her husband, my husbands father, died 7 years ago. He left my mother-in-law a large sum of cash, which she spent instantly to buy a large house in London, and to move all her brothers and sisters from Iran to the United Kingdom, where they live together in a 5 bedroom home. I used to think they were each working, and/or had some left over cash from buying the home. But after I overheard them on the phone, I asked my husband how much his family needed, and if they were struggling to make ends meet. To his credit, he was very forward with me, and explained the whole scenario, detailing how they have no cash of their own, and how none of them hold a job and he's been giving them between 5-10k a month for the past 4 years.\n\nIt turns out, when they had all originally moved to London, my husbands 3 uncles (between the ages of 40-50), had held jobs as delivery drivers or whatnot, while his mother and aunt (f 50?) stayed home. Then when my husband got his new job 4 years ago, which I have now found out pays significantly more than I thought, and he started giving them money, his uncles quit their jobs and he, alone, funds them. He has given them nearly 350k in the past 4 years, which is already a lot, but for a group of 5 able-bodied adults, with a paid off home and taking full advantage of all the publicly funded benefits of the UK system, it becomes far too much in my eyes. I started telling him how his main responsibility is to his family here, and how his daughters well-being and comfort should be his priority. He said it is a priority, how he still is saving up a lot of money for our eventual move, and that he's saved up more than he's given. He said it's just delayed it by a year or two, and that we had to wait for the housing bubble to pop anyways before buying an expensive house.\n\nWe argued for a bit before he called me unreasonable and cold. I am now wondering, am I in the wrong here?\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1692812459, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15zavn9/aita_for_telling_my_f30_husband_m30_to_stop/", "score": 48, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They are disgusting. The problem is that this might be a cultural thing and your husband doesn't see anything wrong with this. Unfortunately I don't think this is a battle you can win and those people are never going to get self-sustaining if your husband keeps financing them.", "Wow absolutely NTA. His main priority should be to his immediate family, and only give what he can to them after he\u2019s made all the ends meet here. A kid needs room to run and play, and to not be able to afford to give them that is one thing, but to be able to but not because you have other priorities is wrong!", "Holy crap! $350k is a hell of a lot of money! You are not TA.", "NTA  HE LIED TO YOU.  A lie of omission, but he still purposefully hid his true income from you and never mentioned supporting his mother and her relatives.  This is borderline divorce territory.  You are supposed to be a team, and going forward, you are completely justified in demanding complete transparency with veto power over any disbursements over 500/month. (Or whatever amount you want)\n\nJust for funsies, I would visit a divorce attorney and find out how much alimony and especially child support he would be on the hook for after a split.  Considering his high income and the fact you have been married since he started working, I would guess quite a lot.  And since your uncle gave YOU the house, he would also have to factor in new lodgings for himself.  See how much he can afford to give mommy after all that.", "NTA - His uncles, aunt and mom are totally capable of working - there is no reason they shouldn't be contributing to their own living. \n\n350K is a HUGE amount of money!!! WTF? I would be livid if (a) I was just finding this out and (b) it was compromising / interfering with our own stated goals. \n\nThis should be a SHARED conversation not a one-way street where he decides. What is timeline for a home purchase? What are his plans for supporting his family - is this going to happen in perpetuity? How much is he contributing to savings? Do you have back-up savings in case he loses his job? Lots to talk about - maybe some joint financial counseling and financial advising is in order.", "You are NTA, his family is. 5 able-bodied adults who are not old or sick, should have no reason to ask for money to sustain their lifestyle, whatever that is.\n\nI urge you however to think about this: He was not forward with you. As a matter of fact, you are the last one to know, how much is your husband earning for real.   \nI'd be very concerned with this alarming behaviour. Neither you, nor your daughter do not come first for him.  Do you even have a family at all?", "Nta. He is literally supporting another family at the expense of his own (that\u2019s you)", "This made me remember a relative who used to give money to his sister and kids and whoever in his family that needed it, he kept doing it even after getting married and having his own kids, he lied to his wife about how much his salary was to keep giving money to the sister, when money or favours were needed everyone wanted only him to do it and didn't care that he already had a family to mantain too.\nHe died from the virus20 and keep his bank accounts as a secret to his wife till the end, she ended with debts from the hospital and medicines, and possibly his family had access to more money from him because one of his relatives appeared with a new car, and none of them really cares about his wife and kids like they expected him to care about theirs.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. The person making unilateral decisions and lying about their *actual* financial situation is TA here.", "He can continue supporting his mom but the uncles and aunts can get fucked imo.", "NTA.  \nOkay, so your mother-in-law decided to spend a ridiculous amount of money on a massive house, in London, then asked a bunch of family members to move in from Iran... And she then turns around and asks her son to pay for everyone else's expenses? Why exactly can't any of the 5 people living in that house start working, if they were able to work previously?  \nYour husband's priorities are all wrong. You need to tell him that his first concern should be his own child and his wife. If his mother made the mistake of living in one of the most expensive places in the world, then that is her problem. There are 5 people living in that house, and 3 of them have worked before. Your husband clearly has enough income to do so much more for his immediate family, but chooses not to due to his mother's mistake. A single person working minimum wage full time has a take home pay of \u00a31,486.61, multiply that by 3 and you have \u00a34459.83 per month. I'm not sure why your husband's mother and aunt weren't working, but I'm assuming there's a reason for that. If the house is fully paid up, no mortgage/rent, then that amount of money is enough for groceries and bills for 5 people.  \nAverage gas bills in a 5 bed house: \u00a3154.50/month  \nAverage electricity bills for a 5 bed: \u00a3136.00/month  \nAverage water bills for a 5 bed     : \u00a355.00/month  \nAvg. food bill for 4 people*1.25   : \u00a3906.25  \nTotal cost: \u00a31251.25  \nThis is affordable on a single, full-time, minimum wage salary. Universal Credit gives one \u00a3368.74/month if you're over 25. If all 5 people are getting this, that's \u00a31843.70/month, which is also enough to pay for everyone's expenses.\nHe called you \"unreasonable and cold\"? That's exactly how his mother is acting, she's basically using her own son as a piggy bank, which she doesn't need to do. With benefits, they can afford the essentials. It seems like your husbands family are simply using him to buy unneccessary luxuries. You all need to have a sit down and discuss exactly what the hell is going on, and that you need that money for your child's future, for your immediate family's future. What if you want more kids? Are they going to have to squeeze into a 2-bed whilst his mother is living large in a 5-bed in London?", "NTA... So NTA", "NTA - I would be absolutely livid.  You\u2019re married and that is your shared money as a family.  Big purchases or spend needs to be discussed and agreed upon.  It\u2019s ok to help family out once in a while but not when it\u2019s avoidable (them working) and not at the expense of your own family\u2019s needs first. Don\u2019t feel you don\u2019t have a say in the way he spends your collective money - even if you didn\u2019t provide the starter home.  This situation and amount is outrageous!  He is blatantly telling you that you and your child come 6th and 7th on his priority list.  I don\u2019t care what culture it is, he\u2019s doing it to impress and needs to tuck that machismo away because it\u2019s not doing anyone long term favours.  40-50 year olds need to be working extra hard to save for retirement if they have no savings.  Careful that you\u2019re not left high and dry.  His actions and secrecy are unreasonable and cold towards you.", "NTA\n\nHe is supporting 5 able bodied adults?  They should be ashamed of taking advantage of the young man!  Shame on them for taking when his own wife and child are going without!", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGet a divorce and sue him for child support. He is an AH.", "He should be supporting you because you are now family and his main focus should be on you, not his family. NTA.", "NTA\n\nIn 4 years he could have paid off most if not all of the costs of a home for you three if you\u2019re in the USA, at the USAs average. It could also pay for several college degrees, even at places like Harvard. \n\nHis family is taking advantage of him and he doesn\u2019t even realize it. Does he have a college fund for your daughter? Or is the mooching family in another country taking too much. They need to support themselves.", "NTA if he thought it was so okay to be sending a large sum of money every month, Why did he hide it?", "NTA and that would be an instant divorce from my part... he lied to you about his salary and he's been giving them 5-10k each month without you knowing?!?!", "NTA. Your husband does his family no favors as he is turning them into a bunch of mooches. You should consider divorcing him because you are not a priority to him, no will any future children be either. The two of you are not anywhere near being on the same financial page. Is he going to expect any future children take over the ATM role for his family when he no longer support everyone?\n\nThere is no excuse for able body adults to not work.\n\nETA. I would insist that he set a deadline for the leeches to get jobs and become self sufficient or you will leave.", "NTA thems grounds for divorce right there. Hiding over 350k in spending?? Holy heck I am sorry you are dealing with such a bad husband problem.", "Woah, I thought you were gonna say a couple hundred dollars, but that's too much NTA", "NTA.  Nope,  if he wants to support them then he can leave and go move in with them.  They are taking full advantage and what is his plan? Support all of them for the next 30 years?!?", "NAH. If he's saved up more than he's given, then he's saved up more than 350K. It's culturally appropriate for your husband to be supporting his mother and family, and it's understandable if it was hard for them to suddenly come from living very different lives to having to be delivery drivers. But it's also understandable for you to feel really betrayed at not being told about this because it absolutely impacts your finances. Your husband is right that it's not a good time to buy right now and you should wait a year or two until the market calms down, but he should have been giving you all the facts and telling you about it from the beginning.", "YTA \n\nYou don't get to just tell him what to do. It's rude to do so. \n\nHe has been honest with you and now you have to be honest with him. You agree with helping but not fully supporting the young uncles for example. \n\nHe should be helping them develop an action plan so that they can earn on their own and eventually support themselves should your mom decide to move or sell. She clearly doesn't need such a large home. \n\nHe is dealing with something you are not familiar with in terms of both a family that supports each other and doesn't necessarily view financial support as different than emotional support - many cultures view finances as familial - and also - coming from somewhere with a lot of poverty and limited opportunities if you aren't highly educated, they may simply not have much of a concept of how to go about this and what they should aspire to. Obv being delivery drivers doesn't seem like a solution bc - as most places - these jobs don't really pay enough to realistically support yourself. \n\nOf course he doesn't want to support them more than he has to but it is entirely normal that he would refuse to simply cut them off and let them fend for themselves. Family is much stronger and isn't just immediate nuclear family in many cultures. So you need to recalibrate your gauge of what you would do or see your peers do. \n\nSo many immigrants all over send money home bc it's simply what you do. Help your family. \n\nJust saying this so you realize you are approaching this from a decidedly limited lens that isn't going to do your husband or your relationship any favours. You need to adjust your vision bc you have married into another culture. Your goals for your immediate family are fine but you cannot expect him to just turn his back on his OG family bc it's not what you are used to.", "NAH, because it doesn\u2019t sound like the husband would have bought a house yet anyway since over inflated home prices Also I have a friend who\u2019s parents and family are from Iran, the situation some of these people have been in is horrific, many don\u2019t talk about it, the husband could just want his family to have a bit of luxury as they\u2019re older", "NAH, except maybe his family. However, they are still his family, and he wants to make sure they are taken care of. And he's not wrong about wanting to wait for the housing market to level out a little. Your concerns are also perfectly valid.\n\nSounds like you two need to have a longer discussion about money coming in and where it's going. But it's a safe bet he will want to continue giving money to his mom. Maybe discuss limiting it to no more than $5k a month.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She's his mom, near retirement age, lost her husband and she got her brothers and sisters into a \"better\" place from where they were before. She put them on. I would never blame your husband for taking care of his mom for the rest of her life.

That household doesn't need $5K-$10K per month to run with five able bodied adults living in it. The uncles are in their 40's. They still have 20-30 years that they could be working and they're just not. You work every day. Your husband works every day. But these people don't need to? If anything, take that money to allow your wife to be at home with your kid while she's small instead of enabling these adults to laze about all day.\n\nYour husband needs to understand that just because you have this money now doesn't mean you always will. With the way inflation has risen and the state of the things anything could happen and what you have in savings may not carry you. What is supposed to happen if the unthinkable happened to your husband? Would they help you and your daughter? Would they have the audacity to think that you should continue your husband's generosity at cost to yourself.\n\nFurthermore, based on the way he's gone about doing things, this situation should be a hill to die on and possibly marriage ending. It's one thing to offer to support your parent/parent in-law with the full and informed consent of your spouse. It's another to do it, to hide it, and then try to play it off like it's no big deal. Sorry, if he'll lie about this, what else will be lie about?"]}
