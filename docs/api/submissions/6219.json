I work from home and am constantly busy but he thinks that since cooking chores fall on me then it's my \"responsibility\" to cook. This has caused me to not perform my job properly and we always argue about it.\n\n\nCoupla days ago, he brought a raw steak from the butcher and in the evening and told me to cook it for him. I refused because I had a meeting that would've lasted for 2 hrs. He kept insisting but I ignored him. Next thing I knew he turned the power off resulting in me being cut off the meeting. It was horrible but he said that I was prioritizing work over my home life. I lost it and threw out his steak instead of cooking it. He blew up at me and called me a bitch because I cost him money and dinner. We argued then he left the house. I ended up getting berated for missing the meeting and my inlaws lecturing me about wasting food and acting crazy but I had about enough.\n\n\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1672601214, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/100r4o8/aita_for_throwing_away_my_husbands_raw_steak_that/", "score": 1032, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I refused because I had a meeting that would've lasted for 2 hrs. He kept insisting but I ignored him. Next thing I knew he turned the power off resulting in me being cut off the meeting. It was horrible but he said that I was prioritizing work over my home life. I lost it and threw out his steak instead of cooking it. He blew up at me and called me a bitch because I cost him money and dinner. We argued then he left the house.

So many of these men get married with these 1960 viewpoints on a \u201cwomen\u2019s\u201d role in marriage spouting off the \u201c make my dinner, clean my house, raise my babies\u201d nonsense while these women are  working and earning more money, but these guys expect to come home from work do nothing and their wives will fulfill their \u201c housewives\u201d fantasy and do all the domestic work as well as earn money. \n\nIt\u2019s time society puts in the effort to help boys understand that traditional gender roles are trash and no women wants to marry a person they have to parent. We need to help boys understand domestic responsibilities even it they never get married.\" \n\nYour husband is 300% expecting to live in a 1960's clich\u00e9 of a wedding.\nSome men believing in this clich\u00e9 are confused and some are willing and other reluctant to change but on and on they make effort to progress for the love of their wives.\nSome other men don't understand love in the first place, they mistaken it and then twist it horribly to order, manipulate, control as they can to make their dream-clich\u00e9 come true.
