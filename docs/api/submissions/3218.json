I have two kids from my previous marriage, (b15) (g13). I am Jewish, as was my first wife before she passed. My current wife is not. We have no kids together. My kids have always got along with their stepmom and her family fairly well, until recently.\n\nThanksgiving with my wife\u2019s family is a huge affair, and it\u2019s the only chance a lot of the family has to see each other during the year. My kids and I do not eat pork, but there are always options for us or we bring something we specifically can eat, like vegetarian lasagna.\n\nWednesday night I had dinner with my wife\u2019s parents at their place. I should mention that my wife is not very personally religious although she attends services with her parents monthly. My PIL are very, very conservative-style Evangelicals. We mostly don\u2019t talk about our religious difference although I once had to stop my MIL from encouraging my daughter to be baptized.\n\nEverything was fine until the end of the meal when my MIL crossed her arms and said \u201cSee, we told you nothing bad would happen.\u201d I asked her what she meant. My MIL said she had mixed bacon into one of the dishes (a casserole) to prove a point to us.\n\nI tried to ask very calmly why she would do something like that. My MIL said it was to show that there was no point in following \u2018the Old Testament law\u2019 anymore. I asked my FIL if he knew what she had done and he said yes. He seemed more uncomfortable but he talked a bit about how Christ came to free us from the Jewish law and that they wanted to show us how we could be freed from the law as well. (He has worked as a pastor in the past).\n\nBy this time my daughter was crying and left the room. My wife got up and followed her. My son has been growing more observant as he gets older (he is more observant than me or my daughter). He flipped out. He screamed at my PIL that they were terrible people, called my MIL some very nasty names, and said he never wanted to come back. My FIL started shouting back and my MIL started crying. I told my kids to get in the car and then told my wife we were leaving. She told me she would stay at her parents so she could help with Thanksgiving prep the next morning.\n\nI was texting with my wife on TG and she told me my son is not welcome to come until he apologizes for the things he called my MIL. I told her that\u2019s ridiculous but she is siding with her parents. I told my kids we would not be attending Thanksgiving. Instead we ordered Chinese and watched movies. My son was fine with it but I could tell my daughter was down. She missed out on seeing a lot of friends she has in my wife\u2019s family. My wife is still at her parents as of now.\n\nI should mention that I too am very angry at what happened and what I feel is the disrespect shown to me and especially my kids. I am torn on whether to encourage my son to apologize contingent on a mutual apology to us.\n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT 1). The title says my son and his MIL. I meant my MIL, his step-grandmother.", "created_utc": 1669395019, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z4i1cv/aita_for_not_making_my_son_apologize_to_his_mil/", "score": 7805, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They're focusing on his bad behaviour rather than dealing with how awful and abusive and disrespectful your MIL was. If your wife doesn't see the problem here, you need to leave her. This kind of behaviour cannot be tolerated or excused.

Your mother in law rubbed it in your children's faces, please do not force your kid to apologize. This was religious discrimination bordering on assault.", "Nope - no apologies from your son.

Bottom line, what this incident made clear is that you guys were already considered interlopers in your in-laws house.  It's not the place of this forum to tell you what you should do, but it should be very clear that blame here rests entirely on your wife's family.  And look, they are entitled to their views - and, I think, entitled to express them in their own house.  But to trick you guys into eating pork...that's insane?  How could you guys ever trust them again - and what did they think the outcome would be?  That you guys would discover that bacon is delicious?  Everyone already knows bacon is delicious - even people who choose not to eat it.\n\nWhat is really disquieting here is that, your wife chose to support this disgusting behavior from your MIL and FIL.  This should send an extremely clear message to your children (and to you) about the degree to which she considers any of you her family.

Her smug comment that nothing bad would happen is infuriating. Of course nothing bad immediately happened. It's not a health issue, nobody was going to go into anaphylactic shock from having their religious beliefs blatantly violated. But it's still a huge violation. Did your wife know of this before hand because she didn't seem upset on your behalf at all, she reacted without any surprise at the events.\n\nAlso, Jesus was Jewish. \n\nI wouldn't forgive them until they spend a year studying Jewish law and maintaining a kosher diet.", "NTA.

They won't die either, but it's disrespect all the same.\n\nYou should really talk with daughter, she seams to be the one more affected. And more pressured to join their religion. Talk about freedom of choice, not only religious. And listen to what she has to say.

It is not reasonable to expect a child to behave perfectly when the adults in his family do something so awful to him, this is 100% your inlaws fault and they are the only ones who should apologize. \n\nThe fact that your wife wanted to stay and continue the holiday is a big red flag. Does she take this seriously at all? Did she set her family straight when they pressured your kids into baptism? If she thinks this kind of bullying of her step kids is okay or excusable, she is a problem.\nIf your wife is not on the same page about holding her parents FULLY accountable for this massive disrespect, she is a problem.

What a horrible and nasty thing to do. Are you sure your wife didn\u2019t know about it?", "NTA- I would tell them that we will not be stepping foot in that home again until they demonstrate respect for our beliefs and apologize for massively overstepping and intentionally and surreptitiously feeding us food they know we do not eat.

Line drawn, boundary set, discussion over.", "NTA\n\nWhat upsets me the most is actually your wife's actions, aka she did not stand up for you. What the inlaws did was just plain nasty and incredibly disrespectful. Though I do not think anyone needs to apologise more than MIL, FIL and wife. Your son, however, needs to learn how to maintain his cool, to stand up for something is important but how it's done is equally important (he's a teen and this is the time to learn these life skills) ... and like you I would suggest he apologises over foul language at some stage IF/WHEN appropriate... If a moment like that ever comes.\n\nI think my first step is to talk the wife in person in order to understand why she did not stand up for you, did not provide a united front as a couple or family, effectively condoned the behaviour of her parents, and showed through it disrespect to you and your children.\n\nIf you are clear as a couple - I would sit down as adults you, wife and FIL and MIL to figure what on EARTH they were thinking!

And if your wife thinks its ok then she may need to stay over there with her parents.", "Uh, I know in some circumstances this would be considered like assault. Didn't the idiot who put bacon on the handles of a Jewish church do jail time for it? Like it's a hate crime.  \n\n\nNTA, the fact your wife is siding with them at all is utterly **INSANE**.", "NTA. No. Do not apologize. You need this moment to teach your son that someone doesn\u2019t get to trample on your beliefs because they think theirs is better.

Your wife is in second place for siding with her parents over you and your kids. Your son is also N-T-A; he was sticking up for his beliefs when people he trusted disrespected him. It would have been ideal to do that without name calling, but he's only 15 and his behavior should not be held to a higher standard than his adult grandparents.

And why, because she's pretty and nice? Honestly, I'm so proud of your son, for being the opposite of you - being the person who cherishes his roots and digs in, and takes pride in who he is and where he comes from, and doesn't throw it away because of prioritising whatever's in his pants. \n\nYou're NTA for not making him apologise, but Y-T-A for bringing your children into this nonsense at all, for making two Jewish children be family with a bunch of proselytising, antisemitic Evangelicals. Shame on you.", "No you are not the asshole. I am so sorry they did that to your children, it is so incredibly disrespectful.

He is a young man and as you said he is now becoming more observent he knows of reflection, contemplation and its importance.

Your son was right in being upset.   Calling names - not so much.  I\u2019m sure it was heated reaction.  He should apologize for that but not for anything else.  Apologizing very specifically for that will give him the upper hand and ultimately he will feel better.  Your son\u2019s feelings matter here.  Not your in laws.  \n\nYour wife is the serious AH though.  She chose her parents over you and your children.  In-laws and wife are sooooooo wrong in all this.   \n\nI am so sorry this happened to you and your children.  The Chinese food and hanging at home was a win.  Good plan!", "NTA and nor is your lovely son.im so sorry they  did that to you, it's unforgivable.  Not a religious thing but I don't eat meat for ethical reasons but don't try to influence others.  A similar thing happened to me at a party and as they all were saying it didn't kill me I said what they did says a lot more about them than about me and good luck to them all trusting anything that any of them cooked for each other if they didn't agree with principles.", "NTA  - you should discuss with your son the issue of an apology.  He needs to understand that his behavior needs to be above his grandmothers.  He also should stress this is not about being able to go back over to their house.  That should never happen again.  The wife chose her parents and you need to choose your children.", "NTA and in the spirit of the holiday a mutual apology may be good to pursue. Though frankly they don\u2019t deserve it in my view. It\u2019s incredible to me that people so blatantly disrespect other people\u2019s religion (or lack thereof, sometimes). What did they think, that you\u2019d have an epiphany and immediately convert? Disgusting. \n\nThough a kid shouting nasty stuff at their elders isn\u2019t particularly good tbh, even when it\u2019s fully deserved. Polite but firm communication, and a swift exit demanding an apology would have led to no dilemma and no need for this post :-)", "NTA. What a difficult situaton. As I Christian myself, I find it disgusting what she did to you. \n\nYour son might should apologize (it was unkind and disrespectful), but she definetly should.\n\nYou could also give her some New Testament Scriptures (the words of Christ) pertaining to cause children to stumble. To know someones moral convictions towards God and then thrwart them is horrible and antithetical to what Christianity teaches. (Paul expressly talks about agreeing to disagree on such matters but if you have a convictions then you need to abide by it).\n\nAlso. Jesus most certainly did not eat pork.", "NTA\n\nYour in-laws broke the 9th commandment and possibly the 3rd commandment.  They should ask themselves \"what would Jesus do?\"  Answer Jesus would probably be none too pleased with them.\n\nEdit grammar", "NTA. \n\nThe in-laws need to apologize. So does your wife. AL LOT.\n\nAnd you need to have a talk with your wife and her family about how serious this boundary crossing was. Explain it was literally a hate crime. And they betrayed you and your children on a deep level. I guarantee she doesn't get it.  And while we are at it, Jesus would NEVER have condoned their actions. It was BEYOND unChristian to deliberately harm their own family.\n\nThe grandkids know now they have been utterly betrayed and disrespected by their grandparents. That cut is deep. But even worse - your wife needs to protect her kids (even though they are \"only\" stepkids.) If she doesn't then she has cut them deep too, and her utter betrayal of them is one they won't get over. \n\nAnd as for that \"Christ came to free us from the Jewish law\" crap well tell them Jesus WAS a Jew, and he was supposed to be the fulfillment of Jewish law. He would never break it. And Christians use the old testament so all the Jewish laws are in there. They apply to Christians too. \n\nNot keeping Kosher won't physically harm you (unless, never having eaten pork, it makes you mildly ill. That can happen) It isn't about Jews being \"poisoned\" by not keeping Kosher. It isn't about fearing god will smite you because you ingested bacon. It is about them disrespecting your bodies at a deeply personal level. \n\nYour kids shouldn't have yelled hateful things in anger. But obviously who can blame them. Their own family turned on them. You HAVE to take their side in this without reservation. Help your son to realize 2 wrongs don't make a right and no matter how justified, lashing out in anger is not the way. If your son is going to live life as a faithful Jew, he is going to have to learn that. If he lashes out every time his Jewishness is attacked he will be in trouble. Being a Jew has always meant being persecuted, sadly, and even today it happens. So use this as a lesson in how to hold faith gracefully while under attack.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I have two kids from my previous marriage, (b15) (g13). I am Jewish, as was my first wife before she passed. My current wife is not. We have no kids together. My kids have always got along with their stepmom and her family fairly well, until recently.\n\nThanksgiving with my wife\u2019s family is a huge affair, and it\u2019s the only chance a lot of the family has to see each other during the year. My kids and I do not eat pork, but there are always options for us or we bring something we specifically can eat, like vegetarian lasagna.\n\nWednesday night I had dinner with my wife\u2019s parents at their place. I should mention that my wife is not very personally religious although she attends services with her parents monthly. My PIL are very, very conservative-style Evangelicals. We mostly don\u2019t talk about our religious difference although I once had to stop my MIL from encouraging my daughter to be baptized.\n\nEverything was fine until the end of the meal when my MIL crossed her arms and said \u201cSee, we told you nothing bad would happen.\u201d I asked her what she meant. My MIL said she had mixed bacon into one of the dishes (a casserole) to prove a point to us.\n\nI tried to ask very calmly why she would do something like that. My MIL said it was to show that there was no point in following \u2018the Old Testament law\u2019 anymore. I asked my FIL if he knew what she had done and he said yes. He seemed more uncomfortable but he talked a bit about how Christ came to free us from the Jewish law and that they wanted to show us how we could be freed from the law as well. (He has worked as a pastor in the past).\n\nBy this time my daughter was crying and left the room. My wife got up and followed her. My son has been growing more observant as he gets older (he is more observant than me or my daughter). He flipped out. He screamed at my PIL that they were terrible people, called my MIL some very nasty names, and said he never wanted to come back. My FIL started shouting back and my MIL started crying. I told my kids to get in the car and then told my wife we were leaving. She told me she would stay at her parents so she could help with Thanksgiving prep the next morning.\n\nI was texting with my wife on TG and she told me my son is not welcome to come until he apologizes for the things he called my MIL. I told her that\u2019s ridiculous but she is siding with her parents. I told my kids we would not be attending Thanksgiving. Instead we ordered Chinese and watched movies. My son was fine with it but I could tell my daughter was down. She missed out on seeing a lot of friends she has in my wife\u2019s family. My wife is still at her parents as of now.\n\nI should mention that I too am very angry at what happened and what I feel is the disrespect shown to me and especially my kids. I am torn on whether to encourage my son to apologize contingent on a mutual apology to us.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Priests do NOT under any circumstances, have Communion wafers with them after a Mass. The unused wafers have been consecrated and are considered to be the body of Jesus. The entire congregation watches the ritual: After Communion, the priest prays quietly while he places the unused wafers in a ciborium, a sort of covered chalice, which is in turn placed in the Tabernacle on the altar.

If the person isn't actually sorry, what's the point? It'll just sow seeds of resentment that will fester and bloom into something worse down the road. Sadly the same goes for your MIL, she's not likely to ever understand or try to understand the damage she caused, let alone feel bad about it, not when she's doing the Lord's work. The best you could hope for is an \"I'm sorry you were upset by my righteous and justified actions\" and that's not good enough. \n\nI'd sit down with your wife and have a serious conversation about whether she really doesn't see how serious her mother's transgression was.

My dad was raised Catholic and I went to Catholic school but *was not* baptized and I was never allowed to take communion.", "I agree with no /s.\n\nThey are greedy and want all the charity to go to them, not people that need it.  Give your 10% or whatever or God will be mad.

Not from them ? Never, wtf.\nGet out of there, please. Respect is NOT an option.", "Yup. I\u2019m Jewish, my fianc\u00e9 is from a Catholic family. They might not have always understood my religion or diet, but they would have never snuck pork into my food. That is some disgusting level of antisemitism. I would be reevaluating this whole marriage.\n\nNTA", "I never realized how ingrained it was in Jewish culture until I was alone on Christmas in Japan and was craving Chinese food. Fortunately, it was easy to find.", "Like that you are **excited** for typos, golly, do I have the same problems. Seriously, absolutely agreed with your post.

Her standard MO was to do over the top acts of charity for people in order to ensare them with guilt, and then \"invite\" them to her church.", "I hear the burden of proof for a civil lawsuit is less. Maybe OP should sue his in-laws for emotional pain and suffering.", "That\u2019s so cool.

I\u2019m glad you got out, and I\u2019m so sorry you suffered through that. \n\nThey\u2019re taking over the US. They try to twist the First Amendment to make it that freedom of religion is only for their religion. These religious freedom acts enable bullies like your former boss. \n\nAlso she fails at Christianity.

Very well stated.", "There is a reason that adding any substances to food that you know the consumer doesn\u2019t want to consume is a felony.
