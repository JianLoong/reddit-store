{"id": 3218, "submission_id": "z4i1cv", "title": "AITA for not making my son apologize to his MIL after an argument?", "selftext": "I (m41) am married to my wife (f37). I have two kids from my previous marriage, (b15) (g13). I am Jewish, as was my first wife before she passed. My current wife is not. We have no kids together. My kids have always got along with their stepmom and her family fairly well, until recently.\n\nThanksgiving with my wife\u2019s family is a huge affair, and it\u2019s the only chance a lot of the family has to see each other during the year. My kids and I do not eat pork, but there are always options for us or we bring something we specifically can eat, like vegetarian lasagna.\n\nWednesday night I had dinner with my wife\u2019s parents at their place. I should mention that my wife is not very personally religious although she attends services with her parents monthly. My PIL are very, very conservative-style Evangelicals. We mostly don\u2019t talk about our religious difference although I once had to stop my MIL from encouraging my daughter to be baptized.\n\nEverything was fine until the end of the meal when my MIL crossed her arms and said \u201cSee, we told you nothing bad would happen.\u201d I asked her what she meant. My MIL said she had mixed bacon into one of the dishes (a casserole) to prove a point to us.\n\nI tried to ask very calmly why she would do something like that. My MIL said it was to show that there was no point in following \u2018the Old Testament law\u2019 anymore. I asked my FIL if he knew what she had done and he said yes. He seemed more uncomfortable but he talked a bit about how Christ came to free us from the Jewish law and that they wanted to show us how we could be freed from the law as well. (He has worked as a pastor in the past).\n\nBy this time my daughter was crying and left the room. My wife got up and followed her. My son has been growing more observant as he gets older (he is more observant than me or my daughter). He flipped out. He screamed at my PIL that they were terrible people, called my MIL some very nasty names, and said he never wanted to come back. My FIL started shouting back and my MIL started crying. I told my kids to get in the car and then told my wife we were leaving. She told me she would stay at her parents so she could help with Thanksgiving prep the next morning.\n\nI was texting with my wife on TG and she told me my son is not welcome to come until he apologizes for the things he called my MIL. I told her that\u2019s ridiculous but she is siding with her parents. I told my kids we would not be attending Thanksgiving. Instead we ordered Chinese and watched movies. My son was fine with it but I could tell my daughter was down. She missed out on seeing a lot of friends she has in my wife\u2019s family. My wife is still at her parents as of now.\n\nI should mention that I too am very angry at what happened and what I feel is the disrespect shown to me and especially my kids. I am torn on whether to encourage my son to apologize contingent on a mutual apology to us.\n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT 1). The title says my son and his MIL. I meant my MIL, his step-grandmother.", "created_utc": 1669395019, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z4i1cv/aita_for_not_making_my_son_apologize_to_his_mil/", "score": 425, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I\u2019m so sorry for you.", "NTA - your MIL crossed a huge line. Was it rude for a teenager to swear at his grandmother? Yes. Was it warranted? Absolutely. They're focusing on his bad behaviour rather than dealing with how awful and abusive and disrespectful your MIL was. If your wife doesn't see the problem here, you need to leave her. This kind of behaviour cannot be tolerated or excused. Be proud of your children for standing up for their boundaries and for not allowing someone else to walk all over them - that's something you want to reinforce, not undermine. Don't participate in your wife's family's gaslighting.", "NTA you do not mess with food. \n\nI don't care if your reasoning is religious, medical or just plain old choice. You do not meddle with food. \n\nIf your MIL is not willing to apologise for what she did then why should your son?", "NTA. I\u2019ll be honest- if my ILs had pulled a similar stunt and my spouse decided to stay with his parents afterwards, he would not be welcomed back into my home.

I cannot imagine a way back from that.", ">I was texting with my wife on TG and she told me my son is not welcome to come until he apologizes for the things he called my MIL.\n\nOne thing we'd agree on is that your son is never setting foot in that house again. \n\n> Instead we ordered Chinese and watched movies.\n\nIronically, that is the Jewish tradition for Christmas in NY.", "Nta, this is a bigger issue than you think and your wife is enabling it. Your mother in law rubbed it in your children's faces, please do not force your kid to apologize. This was religious discrimination bordering on assault.", "Nope - no apologies from your son. What your wife's parents did was foul and abusive. In lots of jurisdictions, it would qualify as assault, and they could be prosecuted for it.\n\nWhy the hell would you ever want to go back in that house?\n\nNTA", "NTA, your wife's parents are aggressively antisemitic.  It is your responsibility to stand up for them.  Your wife needs to see that they broke a commandment by lying to abuse you and your children.", "NTA.

Bottom line, what this incident made clear is that you guys were already considered interlopers in your in-laws house.  It's not the place of this forum to tell you what you should do, but it should be very clear that blame here rests entirely on your wife's family.  And look, they are entitled to their views - and, I think, entitled to express them in their own house.  But to trick you guys into eating pork...that's insane?  How could you guys ever trust them again - and what did they think the outcome would be?  That you guys would discover that bacon is delicious?  Everyone already knows bacon is delicious - even people who choose not to eat it.\n\nWhat is really disquieting here is that, your wife chose to support this disgusting behavior from your MIL and FIL.  This should send an extremely clear message to your children (and to you) about the degree to which she considers any of you her family.

Her smug comment that nothing bad would happen is infuriating. Of course nothing bad immediately happened. It's not a health issue, nobody was going to go into anaphylactic shock from having their religious beliefs blatantly violated. But it's still a huge violation. Did your wife know of this before hand because she didn't seem upset on your behalf at all, she reacted without any surprise at the events.\n\nAlso, Jesus was Jewish. \n\nI wouldn't forgive them until they spend a year studying Jewish law and maintaining a kosher diet.", "NTA. They were egregiously and outrageously out of line and disrespectful. As is your wife for siding with them. I would think long and hard before you had children with this woman. She's as toxic as they are.", "NTA tell your wife that her parents have violated trust on a very serious level that you are not sure your marriage to her will survive. Your in laws are such hypocrites, it was fine to trick you into eating pork and they don't have to apologize but your son does for speaking his mind?\n\nAlso tell your wife discriminating against ones religion is a very serious LEGAL offense. My advice? Change the locks and have your wife's bags packed.\n\nI really don't understand what MIL was trying to accomplish. Fine she doesn't agree with your views. She doesn't have to but good lord.\n\nI might also be asking my wife \"this is so weird for it to suddenly crop up, are you telling me you want a divorce? Are you and your parents trying to force us out?\"", "NTA - I\u2019m sorry that happened to you and your children. If your in-laws religion is so important to them, they should fully understand how important yours is to you. If anyone owes anyone an apology its them to you guys.", "NTA\n\nDon't ever tell your son to apologize. And demand an apology from PIL.\n\nThat's extreme disrespect for one's choise. You didn't die, because it's no an allergy. Buy a religious choice is to be respected regardless. Ask them to eat meat on Good Friday and see what happens. They won't die either, but it's disrespect all the same.\n\nYou should really talk with daughter, she seams to be the one more affected. And more pressured to join their religion. Talk about freedom of choice, not only religious. And listen to what she has to say. And try to set another date to see her friends with their parents, away from PIL.", "NTA \n\nYour wife didn\u2019t stay to help with prepaing for Thanksgiving.

All he did was react to a horrible thing done to him and his family by some anti-semetic assholes. It is not reasonable to expect a child to behave perfectly when the adults in his family do something so awful to him, this is 100% your inlaws fault and they are the only ones who should apologize. \n\nThe fact that your wife wanted to stay and continue the holiday is a big red flag. Does she take this seriously at all? Did she set her family straight when they pressured your kids into baptism? If she thinks this kind of bullying of her step kids is okay or excusable, she is a problem.\nIf your wife is not on the same page about holding her parents FULLY accountable for this massive disrespect, she is a problem.

What a horrible and nasty thing to do. Are you sure your wife didn\u2019t know about it?", "NTA- I would tell them that we will not be stepping foot in that home again until they demonstrate respect for our beliefs and apologize for massively overstepping and intentionally and surreptitiously feeding us food they know we do not eat. The disrespect on this account is far more unforgivable than some harsh words shouted in anger. This was premeditated. Further, they are also not welcome in our home. Line drawn, boundary set, discussion over.", "NTA\n\nWhat upsets me the most is actually your wife's actions, aka she did not stand up for you. What the inlaws did was just plain nasty and incredibly disrespectful. Though I do not think anyone needs to apologise more than MIL, FIL and wife. Your son, however, needs to learn how to maintain his cool, to stand up for something is important but how it's done is equally important (he's a teen and this is the time to learn these life skills) ... and like you I would suggest he apologises over foul language at some stage IF/WHEN appropriate... If a moment like that ever comes.\n\nI think my first step is to talk the wife in person in order to understand why she did not stand up for you, did not provide a united front as a couple or family, effectively condoned the behaviour of her parents, and showed through it disrespect to you and your children.\n\nIf you are clear as a couple - I would sit down as adults you, wife and FIL and MIL to figure what on EARTH they were thinking! And take it from there...\n\nI wouldn't involve any kids until the adults have sorted themselves out!", "NTA but your wife and her parents both are", "NTA.

Let me guess, she was aware of and/ or supported this?\n\nYour in-laws and wife are gaping AHs. NTA.", "NTA. Messing with someone's food is unforgivable. This is an issue of consent, healthy boundaries, and self-determination. Please don't teach your son that he must apologize for standing up for himself!\n\nYour son owes no one an apology, but your in-laws definitely do. The fact that your wife has stayed with them, and not rigidly sided with you is something to be explored in couples counseling.\n\nYour wife and in laws should be deeply ashamed of themselves.", "NTA. That is so extremely disrespectful I can't get my head around it. And if your wife thinks its ok then she may need to stay over there with her parents.", "Uh, I know in some circumstances this would be considered like assault. Didn't the idiot who put bacon on the handles of a Jewish church do jail time for it? Like it's a hate crime.  \n\n\nNTA, the fact your wife is siding with them at all is utterly **INSANE**.", "NTA. No. Do not apologize. You need this moment to teach your son that someone doesn\u2019t get to trample on your beliefs because they think theirs is better.

It hurt your ability to feel you and your kids are safe at their house. It hurt your relationship with your inlaws, and your relationship with your wife. Basically, it hurt your kids and your heart!\n\nGlad you didn't go to Thanksgiving.

Hope this gets better.", "You are NTA, but let's break down who is.\n\nYour in-laws are the biggest AHs here for pulling this BS stunt and starting the whole ordeal. Your wife is in second place for siding with her parents over you and your kids. Your son is also N-T-A; he was sticking up for his beliefs when people he trusted disrespected him. It would have been ideal to do that without name calling, but he's only 15 and his behavior should not be held to a higher standard than his adult grandparents. Only if his grandparents offer up a sincere apology for their own behavior would I even consider having him apologize.

And why, because she's pretty and nice? Honestly, I'm so proud of your son, for being the opposite of you - being the person who cherishes his roots and digs in, and takes pride in who he is and where he comes from, and doesn't throw it away because of prioritising whatever's in his pants. \n\nYou're NTA for not making him apologise, but Y-T-A for bringing your children into this nonsense at all, for making two Jewish children be family with a bunch of proselytising, antisemitic Evangelicals. Shame on you.", "No you are not the asshole. I am so sorry they did that to your children, it is so incredibly disrespectful.

Unacceptable behavior.\n\nYou are doing what a good father does. A good father stands up for his children and they always come first before anything or anyone else in this world.

He is a young man and as you said he is now becoming more observent he knows of reflection, contemplation and its importance.

That's the word being left out here.  This is Antisemitic and despicable. Your son should never apologize.

She didn\u2019t stand up for you guys, which means a part of her agrees with what they did.", "What your in-laws did was blatantly disrespectful of you, your family, and your religion.  Your son was right in being upset.   Calling names - not so much.  I\u2019m sure it was heated reaction.  He should apologize for that but not for anything else.  Apologizing very specifically for that will give him the upper hand and ultimately he will feel better.  Your son\u2019s feelings matter here.  Not your in laws.  \n\nYour wife is the serious AH though.  She chose her parents over you and your children.  In-laws and wife are sooooooo wrong in all this.   \n\nI am so sorry this happened to you and your children.  The Chinese food and hanging at home was a win.  Good plan!", "NTA and nor is your lovely son.im so sorry they  did that to you, it's unforgivable.  Not a religious thing but I don't eat meat for ethical reasons but don't try to influence others.

It\u2019s incredible to me that people so blatantly disrespect other people\u2019s religion (or lack thereof, sometimes). What did they think, that you\u2019d have an epiphany and immediately convert? Disgusting. \n\nThough a kid shouting nasty stuff at their elders isn\u2019t particularly good tbh, even when it\u2019s fully deserved. Polite but firm communication, and a swift exit demanding an apology would have led to no dilemma and no need for this post :-)", "NTA. What a difficult situaton. As I Christian myself, I find it disgusting what she did to you. \n\nYour son might should apologize (it was unkind and disrespectful), but she definetly should.\n\nYou could also give her some New Testament Scriptures (the words of Christ) pertaining to cause children to stumble. To know someones moral convictions towards God and then thrwart them is horrible and antithetical to what Christianity teaches. (Paul expressly talks about agreeing to disagree on such matters but if you have a convictions then you need to abide by it).\n\nAlso. Jesus most certainly did not eat pork.", "NTA\n\nYour in-laws broke the 9th commandment and possibly the 3rd commandment.  They should ask themselves \"what would Jesus do?\"  Answer Jesus would probably be none too pleased with them.\n\nEdit grammar", "NTA. \n\nThe in-laws need to apologize. So does your wife. AL LOT.\n\nAnd you need to have a talk with your wife and her family about how serious this boundary crossing was. Explain it was literally a hate crime. And they betrayed you and your children on a deep level. I guarantee she doesn't get it.  And while we are at it, Jesus would NEVER have condoned their actions. It was BEYOND unChristian to deliberately harm their own family.\n\nThe grandkids know now they have been utterly betrayed and disrespected by their grandparents. That cut is deep. But even worse - your wife needs to protect her kids (even though they are \"only\" stepkids.) If she doesn't then she has cut them deep too, and her utter betrayal of them is one they won't get over. \n\nAnd as for that \"Christ came to free us from the Jewish law\" crap well tell them Jesus WAS a Jew, and he was supposed to be the fulfillment of Jewish law. He would never break it. And Christians use the old testament so all the Jewish laws are in there. They apply to Christians too. \n\nNot keeping Kosher won't physically harm you (unless, never having eaten pork, it makes you mildly ill. That can happen) It isn't about Jews being \"poisoned\" by not keeping Kosher. It isn't about fearing god will smite you because you ingested bacon. It is about them disrespecting your bodies at a deeply personal level. \n\nYour kids shouldn't have yelled hateful things in anger. But obviously who can blame them. Their own family turned on them. You HAVE to take their side in this without reservation. Help your son to realize 2 wrongs don't make a right and no matter how justified, lashing out in anger is not the way. If your son is going to live life as a faithful Jew, he is going to have to learn that. If he lashes out every time his Jewishness is attacked he will be in trouble. Being a Jew has always meant being persecuted, sadly, and even today it happens. So use this as a lesson in how to hold faith gracefully while under attack.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I have two kids from my previous marriage, (b15) (g13). I am Jewish, as was my first wife before she passed. My current wife is not. We have no kids together. My kids have always got along with their stepmom and her family fairly well, until recently.\n\nThanksgiving with my wife\u2019s family is a huge affair, and it\u2019s the only chance a lot of the family has to see each other during the year. My kids and I do not eat pork, but there are always options for us or we bring something we specifically can eat, like vegetarian lasagna.\n\nWednesday night I had dinner with my wife\u2019s parents at their place. I should mention that my wife is not very personally religious although she attends services with her parents monthly. My PIL are very, very conservative-style Evangelicals. We mostly don\u2019t talk about our religious difference although I once had to stop my MIL from encouraging my daughter to be baptized.\n\nEverything was fine until the end of the meal when my MIL crossed her arms and said \u201cSee, we told you nothing bad would happen.\u201d I asked her what she meant. My MIL said she had mixed bacon into one of the dishes (a casserole) to prove a point to us.\n\nI tried to ask very calmly why she would do something like that. My MIL said it was to show that there was no point in following \u2018the Old Testament law\u2019 anymore. I asked my FIL if he knew what she had done and he said yes. He seemed more uncomfortable but he talked a bit about how Christ came to free us from the Jewish law and that they wanted to show us how we could be freed from the law as well. (He has worked as a pastor in the past).\n\nBy this time my daughter was crying and left the room. My wife got up and followed her. My son has been growing more observant as he gets older (he is more observant than me or my daughter). He flipped out. He screamed at my PIL that they were terrible people, called my MIL some very nasty names, and said he never wanted to come back. My FIL started shouting back and my MIL started crying. I told my kids to get in the car and then told my wife we were leaving. She told me she would stay at her parents so she could help with Thanksgiving prep the next morning.\n\nI was texting with my wife on TG and she told me my son is not welcome to come until he apologizes for the things he called my MIL. I told her that\u2019s ridiculous but she is siding with her parents. I told my kids we would not be attending Thanksgiving. Instead we ordered Chinese and watched movies. My son was fine with it but I could tell my daughter was down. She missed out on seeing a lot of friends she has in my wife\u2019s family. My wife is still at her parents as of now.\n\nI should mention that I too am very angry at what happened and what I feel is the disrespect shown to me and especially my kids. I am torn on whether to encourage my son to apologize contingent on a mutual apology to us.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I don\u2019t know if you actually are Christian or not but it\u2019s the world you were raised in. No one said that all goyim are antisemitic. But if I offered you a bowl of popcorn and a few were poison would you take the bowl? \n\nUnfortunately, if we misjudge someone and think that they\u2019re an ally when they\u2019re not, that\u2019s not just embarrassing. It\u2019s dangerous. It\u2019s either you get your feelings hurt or we protect ourselves. \n\nBTW, my dad\u2019s side is Catholic and my best friend was raised Mormon. I have nothing against people of other faiths. I\u2019m just aware of my families history and very much do not want to repeat it.", "YUP!  That is exactly what it is.  They only tolerate them/their beliefs so long as they are a pawn for their own end times mythology.  Other than that, it\u2019s the same hatred towards them that they give to every other religion that isn\u2019t theirs.", "I wish I loved anything as much as Catholic priests love shoving things in the mouths of unconsenting people.", "Perhaps their church is a little more progressive or they are the outliers.", "It\u2019s a completely different translation which reflects in different meanings. I encourage you to read about it.", "I'm not the slightest bit Christian and neither was my family. I might be agnostic, but honestly don't know. Im just tired of intolerance and hate and of the people who practice it seeming face no consequences for their actions. So, honestly, no trace of sarcasm or anything else, if I offended you, I'm sorry. I was just trying to be kind.", "Right?! I was so horrified reading this post. Definitely pulled up that memory of that story. She was mid sentence explaining she was Jewish too when he just\u2026.forced that little wafer in her mouth. What really did it, is that he told her, while forcing something INTO her without her consent, that she was drinking and eating Christ\u2019s body. All of that combined made her vomit. And I remember thinking I hoped she covered him from head to toe in it.", "Are they Evangelical Lutheran Church of America (ELCA)? It has Evangelical in the name but isn\u2019t really part of the evangelical political movement and is considered a mainline denomination.", "You grew up in a Christian society assuming you grew up in the US or most of the world. We see microagressions that you don\u2019t. It\u2019s unfortunate but you will never understand. And that\u2019s okay! Nothing to feel shame over. Just please do not speak over victims of oppression who do see the danger that awaits us if we drop our guards."]}
