The name on the lease is mine and I pay all the bills even though we got it together. When we met we were both living at our parents and I was thinking of moving out already, but as our relationship progressed my bf started pressuring me into getting an apartment because he was tired of us not being able to be together every night. \n\nHe put absolutely zero effort into this apartment, didn't search for it, paid any fees or furniture and i had to do it on my own. \nAt first I didn't mind it too much because I had a stable job and made 3x more than he did. \n\nA couple weeks ago, the company i worked for closed down and I lost my job. I now have a \"transition job\" while I look for a more suitable option. My bf also got a new job and he now makes more than I do. \n\nSince I am struggling a lot to pay all of the bills of the apartment by myself, I asked him to pay his share so the both could live decently. He refused. As of right now my entire salary goes into the bills and the groceries (that he does not pay for either), leaving me with 13euros on my bank account until next pay day in a month. \nMy boyfriend still refuses to pay anything, claiming that he is saving his money for a new car for himself. He also eats out every lunch because he is too lazy to cook and goes out with his friends on nights out regularly. All of this being things I can even do for myself once a month. \n\nThe big fight happened this morning. We went out to dinner yesterday because he pressured me into going (knowing I could not afford it), he payed for d\u00eener and everything was fine. \nThis morning he asked me to payback the entire dinner bill (his share included) because he had \"already planned to take me to a restaurant later this month\" so he didn't want to pay for both. \n\nI became really annoyed telling him he knew I could not afford it because i pay for everything else. I reminded him that I had to give up on my last year of college to take a full time job and pay for our apartment, and that I had to sell some of my belongings (like my pc) to be able to make rent the month before. \n\nHe still refused to understand and participate so I asked him to leave. \n \nNow his whole family is texting me saying that I can't expect him to pay for me when we eat out and that I should give him the money back. \nBut when I bring up me paying for the entire apartment and groceries, they're all saying \"but you made more money than him when you got it\" and saying it's my problem if I now have a shitty job. \n\nI am really starting to think I am crazy, so do you think i am the asshole ?", "created_utc": 1686050632, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/142cu3r/aita_for_kicking_my_bf_out/", "score": 940, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You need to ditch this AH completely! First off, if he's living with you, he should be paying half of everything. If he really pressured you into getting that apartment, then he should be paying half the payments. Also, it's your apartment. You can kick him out anytime. It sounds to me like he wants all the fun without the responsibility. The fact that he won't step up in your time of need also shows that he will never provide for you. NEVER. \nSecond of all, he is straight up abusing and gaslighting you. If he paid for dinner, then made you feel guilty about it later, that's emotional abuse. This guy sounds like a narcissist. He sees your underemployment as an inconvenience to his lifestyle. You unfortunately are enabling him. He doesn't care about you, he is using you.\nThirdly, HIS family is gaslighting you too!

He doesn't deserve the effort.  Forgive me for telling you this, but he doesn't care about you.  He only cares about what he wants.  He will do this to whoever he is with.  He's an abuser.
