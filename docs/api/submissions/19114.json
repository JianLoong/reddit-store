The name on the lease is mine and I pay all the bills even though we got it together. When we met we were both living at our parents and I was thinking of moving out already, but as our relationship progressed my bf started pressuring me into getting an apartment because he was tired of us not being able to be together every night. \n\nHe put absolutely zero effort into this apartment, didn't search for it, paid any fees or furniture and i had to do it on my own. \nAt first I didn't mind it too much because I had a stable job and made 3x more than he did. \n\nA couple weeks ago, the company i worked for closed down and I lost my job. I now have a \"transition job\" while I look for a more suitable option. My bf also got a new job and he now makes more than I do. \n\nSince I am struggling a lot to pay all of the bills of the apartment by myself, I asked him to pay his share so the both could live decently. He refused. As of right now my entire salary goes into the bills and the groceries (that he does not pay for either), leaving me with 13euros on my bank account until next pay day in a month. \nMy boyfriend still refuses to pay anything, claiming that he is saving his money for a new car for himself. He also eats out every lunch because he is too lazy to cook and goes out with his friends on nights out regularly. All of this being things I can even do for myself once a month. \n\nThe big fight happened this morning. We went out to dinner yesterday because he pressured me into going (knowing I could not afford it), he payed for d\u00eener and everything was fine. \nThis morning he asked me to payback the entire dinner bill (his share included) because he had \"already planned to take me to a restaurant later this month\" so he didn't want to pay for both. \n\nI became really annoyed telling him he knew I could not afford it because i pay for everything else. I reminded him that I had to give up on my last year of college to take a full time job and pay for our apartment, and that I had to sell some of my belongings (like my pc) to be able to make rent the month before. \n\nHe still refused to understand and participate so I asked him to leave. \n \nNow his whole family is texting me saying that I can't expect him to pay for me when we eat out and that I should give him the money back. \nBut when I bring up me paying for the entire apartment and groceries, they're all saying \"but you made more money than him when you got it\" and saying it's my problem if I now have a shitty job. \n\nI am really starting to think I am crazy, so do you think i am the asshole ?", "created_utc": 1686050632, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/142cu3r/aita_for_kicking_my_bf_out/", "score": 156, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He wanted his own apartment but he wanted you to pay for it. What he did to you was selfish and inconsiderate. You deserve better than that.", "Now's your chance to find a good job and continue studies.

Not having enough sends you into survival level stress. He saw that happening to you, and did nothing - he doesn't care about you having a good time. And care is necessary when you are grown.\n\n You're amazing for moving out and getting an apartment so soon, supporting two people. His behaviour is unbelievably awful but we all make mistakes and ignore things in our first relationships. It's ok. Just don't give him a second chance, thinking you \"invested time.\" Think of how much better your life will be with someone who cares and the money you spent on his bills and groceries in your pocket, and block everyone who pesters you to take him back.", "The long term currency of relationships are loyalty and generosity... and it doesn't matter if he's only got 10 cents.", "Would you marry this guy?

By yourself. \n\nYou paid for everything. By yourself. \n\nContribution has not been given and if it has (like the dinner) he expects you to pay it back when you reverse the tables on him cause you need help, he gets upset. \n\nThat ain\u2019t fair. And if he was awesome before you moved in together, he got what he wanted. Someone to pay for his living so he doesn\u2019t have to. \n\nIt feels like he\u2019s using you and you deserve better.", "You\u2019re young. It will suck but your whole life is in front of you.

OP clearly there's some neglect or abuse in your childhood that you think this guy is relationship material.  Of course he was great in the beginning he's was probably being kicked out of his mom's house and needed to convince someone to give up their security to ensure his.  That'd be you btw.\n\nFor your own emotional and financial health block this guy and his entire family and move on with your life.  He brings nothing good to you.  And please get thee to therapy so you can avoid losers like this in the future."]}
