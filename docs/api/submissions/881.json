Taking actives into liquidity could gave them access to travel, enjoyment, luxury, etc they may not be able to afford otherwise. Also, as they pass away the property wont have to pay taxes to be inherited as it would already be owned by you and your siblings. \nDisadvantages: you will have to agree in a lot of thing with your siblings and parents and money could strain the relationship.

Technically, my BIL and my husband \"own\" my MIL's condo. They became the owners around the 10 year mark, and MIL is their \"tenant\". The reason why they did this was twofold. \n\nOur state, senior care is based on income. On paper, apart from her investments and retirement, MIL has no additional assets she could use for housing. If MIL were to need care, the house would remain untouchable. It would be sold as a last resort. \n\nSecond, in the event of her passing, with BIL and DH be the owners, no one can contest ownership of the property and it will be theirs to do as they please (either sell or rent). \n\nHowever, based on BIL's behavior and outburst over chairs, me thinks that he is looking at the potential windfall that could come his way rather than doing what's best for his parents.", "Plus if he really wants to buy them new chairs, he doesn't have to own the property to do so.\n\nHonestly, with weak arguments like that, I can only assume that the brother either has some very strange ideas about how finances work, or he has some other motive for wanting this that he's not willing to share.\n\nEither way NTA and don't worry too much about what he thinks going forward, OP.", "exactly; also- if the brother wants to buy them chairs so bad, he could just.... gift them new chairs.

If I had seen any upside, I would have been totally down - but our parents would never qualify for social welfare even with us owning their apartment. \n\nI do see that in some situations it can be helpful to do what your MIL did which was probably giving her condo to her kids - it is a very common thing to do. But in these cases people usually don't pay their parents full price for the house/condo/flat/whatever, right?", "If he wants your parents to pay rent, is this some long con to get money from them? (NTA your bro is shady)", "Is he possibly speculating on moving in when your parents die and believes it's easier as a co-owner? Maybe he fears your parents will sell/will it to another sibling? Or maybe his partner/wife is encouraging it? NTA.", "Short is your  brother  has a screw loose and can't  stand not controlling  you , you not doing  his bidding.  Nta op. your choice  is the logical one", "[removed]", "As for the original plan all three would have been equally on the deed", "[removed]", "> *I think he has some weird thing in his head that somehow down the line Underpants=Profit*\n\nHe might be trying to avoid inheritance taxes, depending on where you all live.  \n\nHe also might be worried that the parents will end up in a nursing home, and their accounts and real estate funds will be all needed for their care.  \n\nIn the US, though, Medicaid looks at something like the last *5 to 7 years* before the application.  So, if your parents signed the apartment over this week, and then had catastrophic health problems, the government could come after the funds if the parents needed them before the grace period.\n\nBrother may think that he can outsmart the feds.  However, I'm sure that they've seen it all.", "Or have it in all 3 of their names and \"forget\" to pay his portion of the mortgage, knowing his more responsible siblings will still cover it so it doesn't tank their credit. Those are the only things I can think of as to why he would be so adamant about this very weird situation.", "Oh hell no. Like I said, I don't fully understand the legal maneuvering that took place to make it happen, it may have been something as simple as transferring the deed. \n\nI do know my dad did something similar with my grandmother when she went into senior living. No property so to speak but multiple funds were moved to him, 5-10 years in advance. \n\nBut again, I don't think your brother's motives are as altruistic as he's trying to make them. Something is hinky.", "Erbschaftsteuer. But I don't get how he would profit if you and sis bought it.", "I'm really curious about what he's to to now. Mind going over to r/de and ask around if anyone has an idea regarding potential benefits? I could see it being a system to avoid inheritance tax but I'm not sure if it would be worth it.", "My grandmother and father did a thing like this. Main reason was to cut down on inheritance tax and to let my dad build equity. My grandmother sold her house to my dad (who already had a stake in it after the death of my grandfather) for market value but lent him the money to do so. She paid rent but that was deducted from the loan. In the end she lived in her house long enough for the loan to be paid off and her even owing my dad, which was a claim to the estate so less taxes. \n\nSale, rent and interest  all at market value to avoid gift tax. (Under Dutch law).\n\nIt worked out but my dad was already a home owner so the situation is different than yours.", "I think this is the best description of my brother I heard in a long time, thanks for the laugh!", "[removed]", "Comment thief! You stole [part of this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yk1n2n/aita_for_not_buying_my_parents_a_flat_like_my/iuqsm6i/) from u/seahorsegal\n\nReport u/Letterxpensivgdf as a bot.", "It seems that given the relationship with your brother, being legally partners with him in anyway would be a decidedly bad idea.  Plus, in general, having family partners in legal contracts usually \nends terribly.  Stop worry about you brother\u2019s bad ideas.", "OP has said that they're in Germany so all that's covered, but he's also started buying up flats since the original conversation and is trying to set himself up as a real estate micro-baron. He's just the standard wheeler-dealer overly serious about himself greedy relative.", "Trying to get some \u201cpreheritance\u201d is my guess.", "Good bot", "Ew...I was going to say that it sounds like he's trying to make it easier to buy his family out and turn it into a rental property for himself in the future, but I wasn't terribly serious about it.", "Not a bot, but thanks anyway."]}
