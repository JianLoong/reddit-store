{"id": 18581, "submission_id": "13w0v8d", "title": "AITA for kicking my sober BIL out of my BBQ", "selftext": "I (31m) and my wife Gal (30f) recently bought our first house and yesterday we hosted our first big BBQ with both sides of the family and friends.\n\nGal's brother Jim (26m) has been sober for 5 months (alcohol and xanax mostly). I don't like Jim. Besides that he's generally an annoying person, he struggled with his drinking and pills for many years and did all kinds of fucked up shit to everyone around him. Lots of theft and trespassing to keep it brief. He's sober now, lives with his (Gal's) mom and I guess he is \"getting his life together\", though he still isnt working or dealing with his court stuff so idk what exactly that entails.\n\nHe's become absolutely insufferable in his sobriety. Everything is about Jesus or sobriety which I could make peace with but he also has made it a habit of trying to \"save\" everyone around him from the dangers of alcohol. Every visit turns into a sermon or him walking around asking personal questions about people's drinking habits. Insisting they need to reconsider their relationship with alcohol.\n\nI specifically told Gal that if Jim was invited to this BBQ that she was going to call Jim and tell him that we wanted NONE of his preaching there. She got on the phone with him but she was beating around the bush so I asked her to put it on speaker and told him \"Jim you are invited but you will NOT talk about sobriety unprompted to any guests. You're not a doctor or a counselor or nothing, so just dont. I dont want to hear a word\" Both Gal and Jim said they understood.\n\nWell, the BBQ starts. Everyones having a good time and my uncle shows up. I offer him a beer and he says something like \"After this week, I'ma need something stronger boy. Where's the brown stuff?\" On fucking cue Jim says something like \"I dont know. Kind of concerning that that's how you choose to deal with a bad week, no?\"\n\nI straight up say \"Hey Jim, how about you grab your stuff and get out of here\"\n\nHe says \"Oh cmon, I didnt mean it like that\"\n\nI say \"JIM I'm not asking you twice. Get the hell out of here. Ive known this man my whole life and you just called him a drunk in front of my family, so you can leave\"\n\nHe tried to defend himself and I just say \"I asked for NOT A WORD Jim\"\n\nEveryone days im the AH for not even giving a chance or letting him apologize but I think I was clear enough. So AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: later on when MIL, SILs and Gal kept going back to the point \"Jim did NOT call your uncle a drunk\" and I kept saying \"He sure did. If he's saying my uncle deals with his issues with booze then you're calling him a drunk\". They say I'm putting words in his mouth and that's not fair. I said he's the one calling out people for \"problem drinking\". What's he think people are going to think hes calling them.", "created_utc": 1685477851, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13w0v8d/aita_for_kicking_my_sober_bil_out_of_my_bbq/", "score": 104, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I wonder how he'd react if every time he tries to preach someone's brings up that no one else has felt the need to also become addicted to drugs and committing actual crimes.", "NTA - that was the only way to be sure he wasn\u2019t going to go around and preach to everyone. He\u2019s being extremely rude. You could throw out anyone who was judging your guests.", "NTA\n\nThis is about intention. BIL didn't attend to enjoy a social gathering. He came to preach, judge, and condemn. His \"recovery journey\" is an ego trip. \n\nHe was not there to catch up with family, talk, and laugh. He was there to cast the sinners down and shine his divine light upon the ignorant masses.  He is the textbook definition of insufferable. \n\nYou don't owe anyone an invite. Why would you tolerate someone whose only desire is to rain on your parade?", "NTA. Sure, you were overly aggressive, but now your BIL knows that you are serious about this and, maybe, next time, when you say \u201cno preaching\u201d, he will take you seriously. Unfortunately, with setting boundaries like this, you have to be ironclad with it the first fire times to let the people know that you are serious, otherwise they will walk all over them.", "NTA,  but you didn't want him there because you don't like him, so you shouldn't have invited him in the first place.", "NTA - he sounds insufferable.\n\nRed flags that your wife doesn\u2019t have your back on this.\n\nJim is like this because his mother and sisters defend him at every turn and enable his behavior. \n\nDon\u2019t be surprised if your wife expects you to house him one day.", "NTA it wasn't his house, it wasn't his rules he was warned and couldn't stick to it. Couldn't be simpler!", "Nta his sobriety isn't the problem, his preachy ahole-ness is.", "NTA \n\nFor everyone who is saying ESH\n\nJim was not part of the conversation, at all. \n\nOP offered his uncle a beer, the uncle said he had a bad week and asked for something stronger.

Kind of concerning that that's how you choose to deal with a bad week, no?\"\n\nThe implication being that alcohol is the uncles only coping mechanism.

Good on you for sticking to your guns.", "NTA!!! Good on you!!! God I hate preachy ppl!", "NTA Rules were set and broken. As said when we were kids...too bad so sad waaaa", "NTA but you overreacted because he didn\u2019t actually call your uncle a drunk. BIL still broke his agreement and was definitely the AH in this situation though.", "NTA he was warned and did not follow the rules.", "NTA. He knew the boundary and violated it anyway.", "NTA.\n\nYou were clear with him that this was not allowed and that if he went against this role, he'd get kicked out. He chose to do it anyway and there were consequences as promised. It's good he got clean, but that doesn't give him the right to look down on everyone else for doing anything he doesn't 'approve' of. He needs to focus on his own life and stop trying to force others to live what he deems an acceptable life. Regardless of what programs he went through, he's not qualified to make health or addiction judgements on anyone.", "NTA", "NTA, because Jim was told this event was Not His Pulpit.

He doesn't get any benefit of the doubt either due to his past behavior regarding this exact situation.", "A good AA and a good sponsor would call him on his bullshit and knock his ego out from under him.

That was rough and mean. He's not wrong, and I don't think he was overly preachy. He's trying to learn sobriety. He hasn't learned that some people can handle alcohol. You are judgy and were a real jerk.", "ESH. Yeah, he overstepped and did just what you told him not to. But seriously nuclear reaction to it. You put him on blast and took pleasure in ripping into him to show how much \u201cbetter\u201d you are. Glad you enjoyed your performance. But you\u2019re not right either.", "ESH. You seem very unpleasant and aggressive.", "Especially after seeing the edit, YTA. Even with your own description of how things happened, I think it's way too strong to say he called your uncle a drunk. It's interesting that nobody else interpreted the event the same way you did. It sounds like you were looking for any excuse for a fight.", "NAH. You set boundaries, he crossed them but not by much.", "YTA.  You don't like him and you were going to find a reason to kick him out.", "After the edit, YTA for two reasons.  One, you seem to think that validation on reddit is going to somehow offset the fact that you embarrassed yourself in front of your family and friends.  None of them will care, they saw what you did.  Secondly, the people that were there think that you jumped the gun because you did.  You can't stand the guy and you took the very first opportunity to send him packing.  Just don't invite people if you don't like them.  And yes, you did put words in his mouth.  Good luck dealing with your family from now on, you will need it.", "YTA.
