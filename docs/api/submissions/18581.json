I don't like Jim. Besides that he's generally an annoying person, he struggled with his drinking and pills for many years and did all kinds of fucked up shit to everyone around him. Lots of theft and trespassing to keep it brief. He's sober now, lives with his (Gal's) mom and I guess he is \"getting his life together\", though he still isnt working or dealing with his court stuff so idk what exactly that entails.\n\nHe's become absolutely insufferable in his sobriety. Everything is about Jesus or sobriety which I could make peace with but he also has made it a habit of trying to \"save\" everyone around him from the dangers of alcohol. Every visit turns into a sermon or him walking around asking personal questions about people's drinking habits. Insisting they need to reconsider their relationship with alcohol.\n\nI specifically told Gal that if Jim was invited to this BBQ that she was going to call Jim and tell him that we wanted NONE of his preaching there. She got on the phone with him but she was beating around the bush so I asked her to put it on speaker and told him \"Jim you are invited but you will NOT talk about sobriety unprompted to any guests. You're not a doctor or a counselor or nothing, so just dont. I dont want to hear a word\" Both Gal and Jim said they understood.\n\nWell, the BBQ starts. Everyones having a good time and my uncle shows up. I offer him a beer and he says something like \"After this week, I'ma need something stronger boy. Where's the brown stuff?\" On fucking cue Jim says something like \"I dont know. Kind of concerning that that's how you choose to deal with a bad week, no?\"\n\nI straight up say \"Hey Jim, how about you grab your stuff and get out of here\"\n\nHe says \"Oh cmon, I didnt mean it like that\"\n\nI say \"JIM I'm not asking you twice. Get the hell out of here. Ive known this man my whole life and you just called him a drunk in front of my family, so you can leave\"\n\nHe tried to defend himself and I just say \"I asked for NOT A WORD Jim\"\n\nEveryone days im the AH for not even giving a chance or letting him apologize but I think I was clear enough. So AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: later on when MIL, SILs and Gal kept going back to the point \"Jim did NOT call your uncle a drunk\" and I kept saying \"He sure did. If he's saying my uncle deals with his issues with booze then you're calling him a drunk\". They say I'm putting words in his mouth and that's not fair. I said he's the one calling out people for \"problem drinking\". What's he think people are going to think hes calling them.", "created_utc": 1685477851, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13w0v8d/aita_for_kicking_my_sober_bil_out_of_my_bbq/", "score": 655, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

UGH", "Someone said to me in a conversation recently that you can't really just drop a habit without replacing it with something else, addicts often replace one habit with another, and that religious zeal can be a form of addiction.\n\n(The person who said this to me was a Christian prison chaplain.)", "Nta.

Be blessed and pray for him and try to encourage him in his sobriety,  just maybe not at your house, lol.", "NTA, but as a tactical matter, I think it was a mistake to insist that Jim was calling your uncle a drunk.  He didn't use those words, and you pushing that interpretation allowed the conversation to get sidetracked into whether what he said was the same as calling your uncle a drunk.  \n\nBottom line is that it was crystal clear that he wasn't supposed to talk to people about drinking, and what he said broke that agreement -- that was the point to have pushed with your in-laws.\n\nGood luck.", "NTA, man has been sober for 5 months, he has no right to comment/give advice to others.

It should have confused him, instead he already planned the defense out in his head. Again, NTA.", "NTA. Fuck Jim.", "NTA - you fairly warned your BIL and of the consequences.

Fuck Jim!", "NTA- I wouldn\u2019t bother inviting him to any future events, he\u2019ll just do the same thing  again", "NTA, he was fairly warned and did it anyway.

She'll ask me if I want her sponsors phone number while proclaiming \"OMG, you had 10 jello shots?!\" I had made the jello shots, one cup of vodka made 20 of them.

He gave him exactly one chance and he blew it.", "If they're in AA and are preachy, they're doing it wrong.", "Unfortunately, it's not going to stick.  Jim has the whole family making excuses for his shitty behavior, no doubt exactly like they did before he got sober.", "Happy\ud83c\udf82day!", "Good for you! Three weeks is early but absolutely commendable", "This internet person is proud of you. Stay strong and be kind to yourself!", "\"Theres nothing worse than a reformed addict\"? \nWhat a disgusting, toxic thing to say. \nI know you meant to say \"there nothing worse than a recovering addict that is constantly preaching about how others need/should be careful with drugs/alchohol\" but even then, if you really think there's nothing worse than a recovering addict preaching sobriety, you need to go get your head checked.", "This is why I never went to meetings or went out of my way to hang out with people in recovery when I quit drinking.

His Jesus talk and need to try to save everyone will eventually mellow.  Do your wife, family and friends a favor. Don't act like an AH to someone trying to rediscover life.

You also have better resources than he did. \n\nI don't think that I should have to say this to a young person, but HE'S IN RECOVERY FROM A COUPLE OF ADDICTIONS. He probably forgot at least one decade of his life, so, while you don't need to treat him with kid gloves, you do need to help to support his sobriety by not being the kind of person who is mean to those on the road to sobriety, which, by the way, has the potential to bring him back to being the blacked-out drunk junky who you can't trust around anything nice.", "Well said.", "Yeah, with someone like that I'd say they're very used to disrespecting others and getting away with it. \n\nLet OP be someone he can't get away with that crap with.

It was wild. It took that long tho.", "1997. They still smell amazing.", "This. You can talk about AA generally. Don't say who you saw at meetings. Don't talk about what is said when people are sharing their story.\n\nSome take out to the extreme of a Fight Club scenario.

He made reasonable expectations and the BIL suffered the consequences, just like AA teaches.", "For me, the smoke itself smells fantastic if it's fresh, but the stale smell that seeps into clothes and cars is pretty nasty.
