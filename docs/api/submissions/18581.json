I don't like Jim. Besides that he's generally an annoying person, he struggled with his drinking and pills for many years and did all kinds of fucked up shit to everyone around him. Lots of theft and trespassing to keep it brief. He's sober now, lives with his (Gal's) mom and I guess he is \"getting his life together\", though he still isnt working or dealing with his court stuff so idk what exactly that entails.\n\nHe's become absolutely insufferable in his sobriety. Everything is about Jesus or sobriety which I could make peace with but he also has made it a habit of trying to \"save\" everyone around him from the dangers of alcohol. Every visit turns into a sermon or him walking around asking personal questions about people's drinking habits. Insisting they need to reconsider their relationship with alcohol.\n\nI specifically told Gal that if Jim was invited to this BBQ that she was going to call Jim and tell him that we wanted NONE of his preaching there. She got on the phone with him but she was beating around the bush so I asked her to put it on speaker and told him \"Jim you are invited but you will NOT talk about sobriety unprompted to any guests. You're not a doctor or a counselor or nothing, so just dont. I dont want to hear a word\" Both Gal and Jim said they understood.\n\nWell, the BBQ starts. Everyones having a good time and my uncle shows up. I offer him a beer and he says something like \"After this week, I'ma need something stronger boy. Where's the brown stuff?\" On fucking cue Jim says something like \"I dont know. Kind of concerning that that's how you choose to deal with a bad week, no?\"\n\nI straight up say \"Hey Jim, how about you grab your stuff and get out of here\"\n\nHe says \"Oh cmon, I didnt mean it like that\"\n\nI say \"JIM I'm not asking you twice. Get the hell out of here. Ive known this man my whole life and you just called him a drunk in front of my family, so you can leave\"\n\nHe tried to defend himself and I just say \"I asked for NOT A WORD Jim\"\n\nEveryone days im the AH for not even giving a chance or letting him apologize but I think I was clear enough. So AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: later on when MIL, SILs and Gal kept going back to the point \"Jim did NOT call your uncle a drunk\" and I kept saying \"He sure did. If he's saying my uncle deals with his issues with booze then you're calling him a drunk\". They say I'm putting words in his mouth and that's not fair. I said he's the one calling out people for \"problem drinking\".

He didn't use those words, and you pushing that interpretation allowed the conversation to get sidetracked into whether what he said was the same as calling your uncle a drunk.  \n\nBottom line is that it was crystal clear that he wasn't supposed to talk to people about drinking, and what he said broke that agreement -- that was the point to have pushed with your in-laws.\n\nGood luck.", "NTA, man has been sober for 5 months, he has no right to comment/give advice to others.

I had heard the term but didn\u2019t realize what all it entailed.", "I don\u2019t mind when people I know smoke near me because it reminds me of my grandma. As cheesy as that sounds, it\u2019s a positive association for me.", "After quitting for a while I find the smells around distasteful. But I'm always a cigarette away from smoking again. Even though I hate the smell on my clothes and hands, and I hate 2nd gad smoke but I'd happily take up smoking again.\n\nPlus the smoke break society. You lose some human connection in quitting.", "Imagine a world where the enablers have the control because of what other people think when actual boundaries are enforced. I think the ladies need Al-Anon because they are part of that addicts dynamic.", "Yep. I definitely think BIL was the asshole here, but I\u2019m also glad you called out that this is a phase a lot of us have gone through. I feel just a little bit for BIL, current asshole behavior aside.", "I think you might've missed something. That term has been used since the 50's to describe someone that shows symptoms of alcoholism without consuming alcohol.\n\nSo I kinda doubt that movie was trying to make a completely different point, I think you just brushed the surface.\n\nEdit: The 50's are the earliest references to it I'm seeing, at least. Don't feel like doing a deepdive on this one.", "Recovering alcoholic and training addictions counselor.\n\nJust because you seem curious.. \"Dry drunk\" is a term used to describe someone who has stopped using but continues to exhibit the same damaging behaviors, whether it be abuse, overstepping, stealing, lying, what have you.\n\nPart of being sober (as opposed to dry) is changing the things about us which led us to drink/use in the first place", "This actually why it is hard for me to stop smoking, because it is also for me to get out for a bit.", "Same here with not drinking. People are so insistent about it!! People don\u2019t understand why I won\u2019t \u201cjust try a sip\u201d because \u201cit doesn\u2019t taste like alcohol\u201d and my sister gets pissy when she tricks me into drinking alcohol and I get upset with her about it. Just respect my boundaries and don\u2019t be weird!", "A.A.A\n\nAlchoholic Atheists Anonymous", "I quit with each pregnancy and breastfeeding but something always happend; in-laws,my family mainly brother, crisis, etc. \n\nI quit for 4 months taking Chantix but that gave me sleep walking issues that were not fun for my husband and kids. \n\nLast year I tried the patch but a death and loss of our vast majority of income.....yeah. \n\nRight now we are so broke we have been quitting but it's because we can't afford even a pack. Can't afford any type of patch or crutch which just seems to make the symptoms so much worse. If it can go wrong this year it has.  I'm in severe shape but first trying to just make sure my kids have food and home. It certainly doesn't seem like it will stick at all. But ending on a good note!  Since I haven't eaten much I have lost 15 pounds in less than a week!!!  That is straight up the only up. LOL. Any tips would be so very appreciated that haven't already been tried or cost anything. I also won't have a for much longer so....  Advice?", "Sorry that was a skizzer ramble. LOL. Told ya it was bad. Thank you to those that got through with some coherence.", "Jim sounds annoying as hell but I do think YTA here for throwing him out immediately and making it a far bigger scene than it needed to be. From what you've described, it doesn't sound like he called your uncle a drunk, even if the conversation was eventually going that way. \n\nI feel like you should've given him one warning there after he said that, or at least told Gal he's doing it and let her handle it.\n\nBut hey it's your BBQ you can do what you want at the end of the day, I just think your reaction was harsh to Jim and to Gal. To Gal this isn't just some annoying problem guy in the friend group, that's her brother", "YBA: he\u2019s a preachy asshole and you\u2019re a jump the gun asshole.", "OP\u2019s wife doesn\u2019t seem to have any say in the matter, and for that reason I think he is an asshole. It\u2019s her brother, and it\u2019s her home and her party just as much as OP\u2019s. \n\nI have a feeling OP was looking for a reason to get rid of BIL. Would it kill him to just be patient and let BIL be a bit annoying? It has only been going on for a short while (BIL has only been sober for 5 months). The family should support him, even if he is a bit much. \n\nIf it continues for years, then it\u2019s another matter.", "I avoided NA for a while because I thought everyone would be like this guy, those fears were completely unfounded. NA is probably the most accepting organization I have ever seen, thanks for sharing your perspective.", "This might be a useful angle for OP to explain to family that BIL\u2019s behavior is not okay *by the parameters of his own program.* They won\u2019t have to worry that criticizing him on this will knock him off track, if they understand that he\u2019s already off track by acting this way.\n\nAnd useful language to shut down BIL\u2019s bullshit next time.", "There was nothing aggressive about this response.

He clearly doesn\u2019t have much love for the bother do to the brother\u2019s previous actions so it\u2019s fair that the wife had to compromise to get him in the door and op followed the terms.", "The call was the warning and he did imply the uncle is a drunk", "He was warned and didn\u2019t listen", "So the dude insulting the uncle is fine since his in recovery?", "Or he could not preach and insult others as instructed", "Step 12 is carrying the message to other alcoholics, tho?", "The show Single Drunk Female also shows this a bit - the main character is an alcoholic who has to join AA after assault & drunk driving,", "Yes, and his brain is still addled. It\u2019s going to take a while for his brain to get rid of the toxins from drugs and alcohol. He shouldn\u2019t be telling anyone anything at this point.", "Add formerly fat people who treat fat folks like dirt. All of these groups somehow lose all empathy and forget their own journey. I suspect it's shame-masking, but I'm not a psychiatrist.", "I\u2019m so glad you had a good experience, the group I tried was incredibly exclusive and unwelcoming. I felt like I was disrupting a private meeting, made to feel like an outsider, wasn\u2019t welcomed at all. It took a lot of bravery for me to show up just to be shut down. If I ever get sober, I understand that I\u2019m doing it all alone.", "Twenty bucks says that even if OP had given Jim a \u201csecond chance\u201d to explain himself, Jim would\u2019ve just doubled down on his intrusive assholery.

It would be a red flag if the sexes were reversed, as well. Grow up.", "Another way of explaining what a \u201cdry drunk\u201d is: someone who is not drinking, but is also not working toward health and wellness. They\u2019re \u201cwhite knuckling\u201d it and using will power (which is fleeting) to stay sober. They are not working a recovery program which entails the pursuit of mental, physical, spiritual and emotional wellness.
