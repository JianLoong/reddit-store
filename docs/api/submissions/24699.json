Closer to my mom but I often visited my dad (about 3-4 times a week). A few years ago he started dating \u201cAnna\u201d. Anna and I always got along when my dad proposed I was happy Anna seemed like she would be a great stepmom. \n\n\nWell a few weeks before the wedding after I had bought everything (dress, shoes, etc) my dad and Anna said they needed to \u201ctalk to me\u201d Anna and my dad decided to have a child free wedding which I get especially for young kids. Well turns out child-free means no one under 18. On the day of the wedding, I was still going to be 17 so, therefore, I\u2019m not allowed to be at the wedding because Anna wants to stay true to the child-free rule even for the daughter of the groom and her about-to-be stepdaughter. \n\nThe funny thing is my 18th birthday was just 2 days after the wedding. But still, I wasn\u2019t allowed to go. The wedding was just last weekend (the 12th) and my birthday was yesterday (the 14th). I haven\u2019t talked to Anna or my dad since they told me I couldn\u2019t attend the wedding since I wasn\u2019t an Adult. My mom ended up taking me on a birthday vacation and yesterday I posted birthday pictures on Facebook and said finally an adult I\u2019m so glad my dad and Anna didn\u2019t allow me at their wedding since I was under 18 I feel more mature since yesterday. The family was freaking out asking if that was true and bashing my dad and Anna. I later got a bunch of texts from my dad and Anna calling me immature and a selfish brat and that\u2019s why I was too immature to be at a wedding. I was talking to some friends and they said I was kinda an AH for doing that and I should have just let it go.", "created_utc": 1692113317, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15rvv1a/aita_for_letting_people_know_through_social_media/", "score": 1004, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Closer to my mom but I often visited my dad (about 3-4 times a week). A few years ago he started dating \u201cAnna\u201d. Anna and I always got along when my dad proposed I was happy Anna seemed like she would be a great stepmom. \n\n\nWell a few weeks before the wedding after I had bought everything (dress, shoes, etc) my dad and Anna said they needed to \u201ctalk to me\u201d Anna and my dad decided to have a child free wedding which I get especially for young kids. Well turns out child-free means no one under 18. On the day of the wedding, I was still going to be 17 so, therefore, I\u2019m not allowed to be at the wedding because Anna wants to stay true to the child-free rule even for the daughter of the groom and her about-to-be stepdaughter. \n\nThe funny thing is my 18th birthday was just 2 days after the wedding. But still, I wasn\u2019t allowed to go. The wedding was just last weekend (the 12th) and my birthday was yesterday (the 14th). I haven\u2019t talked to Anna or my dad since they told me I couldn\u2019t attend the wedding since I wasn\u2019t an Adult. My mom ended up taking me on a birthday vacation and yesterday I posted birthday pictures on Facebook and said finally an adult I\u2019m so glad my dad and Anna didn\u2019t allow me at their wedding since I was under 18 I feel more mature since yesterday. The family was freaking out asking if that was true and bashing my dad and Anna. I later got a bunch of texts from my dad and Anna calling me immature and a selfish brat and that\u2019s why I was too immature to be at a wedding. I was talking to some friends and they said I was kinda an AH for doing that and I should have just let it go.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
