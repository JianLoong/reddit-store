Closer to my mom but I often visited my dad (about 3-4 times a week). A few years ago he started dating \u201cAnna\u201d. Anna and I always got along when my dad proposed I was happy Anna seemed like she would be a great stepmom. \n\n\nWell a few weeks before the wedding after I had bought everything (dress, shoes, etc) my dad and Anna said they needed to \u201ctalk to me\u201d Anna and my dad decided to have a child free wedding which I get especially for young kids. Well turns out child-free means no one under 18. On the day of the wedding, I was still going to be 17 so, therefore, I\u2019m not allowed to be at the wedding because Anna wants to stay true to the child-free rule even for the daughter of the groom and her about-to-be stepdaughter. \n\nThe funny thing is my 18th birthday was just 2 days after the wedding. But still, I wasn\u2019t allowed to go. The wedding was just last weekend (the 12th) and my birthday was yesterday (the 14th). I haven\u2019t talked to Anna or my dad since they told me I couldn\u2019t attend the wedding since I wasn\u2019t an Adult. My mom ended up taking me on a birthday vacation and yesterday I posted birthday pictures on Facebook and said finally an adult I\u2019m so glad my dad and Anna didn\u2019t allow me at their wedding since I was under 18 I feel more mature since yesterday. The family was freaking out asking if that was true and bashing my dad and Anna. I later got a bunch of texts from my dad and Anna calling me immature and a selfish brat and that\u2019s why I was too immature to be at a wedding. I was talking to some friends and they said I was kinda an AH for doing that and I should have just let it go.", "created_utc": 1692113317, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15rvv1a/aita_for_letting_people_know_through_social_media/", "score": 12853, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Closer to my mom but I often visited my dad (about 3-4 times a week). A few years ago he started dating \u201cAnna\u201d. Anna and I always got along when my dad proposed I was happy Anna seemed like she would be a great stepmom. \n\n\nWell a few weeks before the wedding after I had bought everything (dress, shoes, etc) my dad and Anna said they needed to \u201ctalk to me\u201d Anna and my dad decided to have a child free wedding which I get especially for young kids. Well turns out child-free means no one under 18. On the day of the wedding, I was still going to be 17 so, therefore, I\u2019m not allowed to be at the wedding because Anna wants to stay true to the child-free rule even for the daughter of the groom and her about-to-be stepdaughter. \n\nThe funny thing is my 18th birthday was just 2 days after the wedding. But still, I wasn\u2019t allowed to go. The wedding was just last weekend (the 12th) and my birthday was yesterday (the 14th). I haven\u2019t talked to Anna or my dad since they told me I couldn\u2019t attend the wedding since I wasn\u2019t an Adult. My mom ended up taking me on a birthday vacation and yesterday I posted birthday pictures on Facebook and said finally an adult I\u2019m so glad my dad and Anna didn\u2019t allow me at their wedding since I was under 18 I feel more mature since yesterday. The family was freaking out asking if that was true and bashing my dad and Anna. I later got a bunch of texts from my dad and Anna calling me immature and a selfish brat and that\u2019s why I was too immature to be at a wedding. I was talking to some friends and they said I was kinda an AH for doing that and I should have just let it go.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Even if OP didn\u2019t post about it on social media, she still talks with other family members, and so does her mom who also knew about this.  Did dad and stepmom really think their lie was going to last?", "I would be super petty and make a follow up post with the screenshots of their messages", "I'm cutting her slack for the attitude because she's 18 and just got a major snub from her father. He deserved it.", "Yeah, the moment the kids are old enough to behave without needing constant attention or supervision is good enough for me, no reason not to include them in the wedding celebration.", "My dad got remarried the day after my parents' divorce was final. Didn't tell us. And then was confused why his kids weren't willing to play \"happy family\" with his new wife and stepkids. I haven't talked to him or them in 15+years.", "Hell, I have three brothers and it frequently takes my dad two or three tries to get my *name* right lol", "My birthday is the day before my dad's. My mom (divorced) had to call and remind him. Later she completely forgot about my 15th birthday. Guess who's an oops baby.", "NTA. They\u2019re classic narcissists - trying to flip themselves from the offenders to the victims. If they didn\u2019t want to be embarrassed by their behavior, they shouldn\u2019t have behaved that way. Good for you in being \u201cmature\u201d enough to know that if it l behaves, looks & smells like shit, it\u2019s probably not chocolate - no matter what anyone tries to tell you.", "I wasn't invited to my dad's wedding. Didn't know he got engaged. I was 8 (or 9??), my brother 12. Dad lived in a different state, and we found out from a phone call right before we were scheduled to go for our summer visit that he was married and had a stepdaughter. And people wonder why I didn't have a close relationship with him. /s.\n\nTurned out fine, though. Stepmom and stepsister are great. Dad and stepmom ended up divorced years later, he passed 6 years ago. I still keep in touch with my stepmom and stepsister because they're great. Never did get closer to Dad, though.", "What is it with all the friends and family of OPs  not wanting them to express appropriate anger when they have obvious reasons to be mad?  Being the bigger person is sometimes appropriate but there are times when it is definitely not good to go high when they go low. Also taking the high road can lead to abuse and resentment. Sometimes people should be called out.\n\nIt's apparent that your dad and stepmom didn't tell people why you weren't there. They probably lied about your absence.", "Not to mention they told her after she bought her outfit for the wedding. Clearly they\u2019d given the impression she would be there. It was a bait and switch.", "I went to my parents wedding when I was three, and so did my 2yo twin siblings. \n\nI cried so hard when mum curled her hair she had to straighten it again. I also refused to be in any photos and generally acted like a goofy ass all day. \n\nmy brother cried *so hard* during the ceremony that mum had to hold him the entire time \ud83d\ude02\n\nonly my sister behaved like an adorable angel. \n\nto be fair tho, me and my brother were right & my mum never should've married that loser.", "You really think the father isn't gonna try to make OP sound like a lying brat. The texts are the evidence of his behavior. She should post them, block him and his tramp AND THEN move on with her life.", "Thats the brilliance of step mom.. She ensured that op wouldn't be in their lives in single stroke.. She is 18 and father is not legally tethered but cutting emotional ties in one sweep is what she wanted. No more sharing holidays with their future children or sharing her husband's attention away from future fatherhood. OPs father is also shrewd who wants minimum contact with op now that new children will be there to pump his narcissism", "This honestly made me laugh entirely too much after reading through so many people explained horrible shit. You're awful and amazing lol", "Yeah, you were with me at that thing we went to.", "When my bio father finally keels over, I have no doubt I will weep with joy!"]}
