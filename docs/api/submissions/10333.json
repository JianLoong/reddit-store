They're not siblings. They're friends of some length of time who happen to live together because their parents married.\n\nTreating them with trust is one thing.  Being realistic about their actual relationship is another, and there is nothing wrong with being so.\n\nYour wife needs to realize that should something happen, and it doesn't go well, they will be living together in a circumstance that could be painful and unhealthy.  And escaping it would be very hard, as they aren't self supporting adults.  They'd be trapped together.  That's hard for an emotionally mature person. They're teens. Please do what you can to keep them from this potential burden.", "They weren't raised as siblings. I doubt they view one another that way.

Some of us are curious around that age", "NTA you are doing great. They are teenagers and have been friends for so long.

They just do it in the bathroom or when you're not there.", "NTA. But man, there is a lot to unpack here. \n\n> when it gets late they just gets into bed with each other\n\nIt is very unusual for two people of that age to sleep in the same bed, who didn't grow up together, without... something going on. Hell, when I slept over at friend's houses, I was on a cot or the floor, not IN THE SAME BED. Even at much younger ages.\n\nThe fact that they are opposite sex isn't really relevant in this day and age.\n\nBut... these kids are almost 18. I think the bigger question you need to ask is, IF something were to go on, would it make sense to object? They're not blood relatives, and you need to face the fact that your kid (and step-kid) have sexual lives that you don't control. What you should be offering them is medical help, if they need it, and a place of safety in the event that they get involved in something criminal\\* or if a relationship goes badly. Otherwise, it's not really your business.\n\nI get that this is all complicated by the fact that the kids are housemates, but... that wasn't really their choice, was it? I mean, they're in these close quarters because you put them there.\n\n\\* To be clear, I meant in the general case of relationships. Not implying that anything criminal is going on between them.", "NTA. They are not related, and did not grow up as siblings. If you don't temper this you'll be father and father-in-law.\n\nIt's one thing if they choose to be together after, say, the age of 22, but at 16 and 17 you don't need to have a baby in the house by them.", "NTA, you are doing the right thing.  They were not raised together nor are they blood related so I highly doubt they consider themselves sibling. It\u2019s great that they have a good relationship as blended families can be difficult. They are too young to understand appropriate boundaries so you setting that expectation is good.

I would keep the rule but heavily educate the use of condoms and even go as far as to make sure they have them.", "NTA\n\nYour kids aren't related and probably don't see each other as stepsiblings since they weren't raised together. I'm not saying they find each other attractive, but these things \\*could\\* happen. It's odd and weird that they are trying very hard to sleep in the same bedroom. I never did this with my siblings.\n\nMy household also had this policy when we had friends over.

If they want to have sex they will. I doubt they would do it while you are awake and in the next room . They will just wait until your sleeping or not home. Also you could totally be paranoid for no reason at all they might not like each other in that way at all. The best thing to do is have a safe sex talk.
