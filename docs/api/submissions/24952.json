The world does not revolve around you because you reproduced. \n\nShe has filled her time with her hobbies, these are prior commitments, most likely classes in a series, that she's paid for. How is an adult having hobbies and taking classes childish or immature? Why should she ditch them because you refuse to be flexible?\n\nSounds like she's having a nice life and won't miss your presence in it. You're not getting that apology.", "YTA massively.\n\nYour friend taking classes isn't childish ffs. \n\nIf she doesn't have children- how do you think she spends her time? _waiting for you to be free to hang out?_\n\nWhy is your schedule more important than hers? Why is she wrong for filling her free time with things she enjoys?\n\nYou sound a bit envious of her free time. Being a mom is really really really hard. I applaud you for all the work you've put into your child so far. If you have unconditional love for your child- you will work on yourself now.  You owe Sasha a massive apology for the name calling, and your frankly entitled behavior. She does not need to cancel her plans to spend time with you. You need to accept you won't see her as often until your schedule gets more flexible. This isn't Sashas fault.\n\nI'm sorry your struggling OP. I wish you the best of luck.", "YTA and you owe HER an apology.\n\nSasha isn't being childish. She's living her life. She made commitments to classes, and those things are important to her. You decided to have a baby because that was important to you.\n\nShe's supposed to be totally flexible just because her life doesn't involve a child? Just because you don't see the value in what she is doing with her life doesn't mean it's not important. That's her LIFE. Yours is now run by a baby, and that's great, but it is NOT more important than Sasha's life. You made your choices, she made hers, and you dismissing her life is a rude thing to do. You're not respecting her and her time, and you seem to think that just because you have a baby now you should be catered to.\n\nGet off the entitlement horse and grow up. Her life is not less important than yours, and if you can't see that, Sasha doesn't need you around in the first place.", "YTA with no room for doubt. \n\nShe has interests and hobbies that take up her time. She communicated that she had 30 minutes, and then for some reason you are surprised that she was serious?\n\nSo your schedule is not flexible, by your own admission, so everyone has to revolve around you? Grow up. She has things to do, a business to run, and classes that she pays to attend.  Why would she pay for a class, then skip it?  \n\nShe doesn\u2019t owe you an apology at all. If anything, it\u2019s you who owe her the apology. Everything about this post is \u201cme me me\u201d and then you think she is the one being childish? \n\nGrow up. \n\nYTA.", "YTA!  Classes and keeping interested and active outside of work is fantastic!  You lose a lot when you don't attend sequences of classes. Dance would be really confusing. I wish I had the discretionary income right now to do what she does. \n\nShe's the opposite of immature. A lot of people stop learning once traditional school is done. She sounds like someone I'd like to hang out with. Are you jealous or something?", "YTA just because she doesn't have kids doesn't mean she isn't busy or is being immature. You're the one who needs to grow up", "YTA. She IS acting like an adult, she has obligations, she is probably paying good money for these classes and rescheduling them comes with a hassle, and if she wants to continue to educate herself and self-improve, all the kudos to her. You are one who should be more understanding that other people have life that doesn't revolve around you.", "YTA - Enormously.  I think it's time for you to grow up and recognize that other people are going to live different lives than the life you've chosen.  There is absolutely nothing immature about taking a class as an adult and taking it seriously.  Moreover, self-employed individuals, contrary to popular belief, are not \"available whenever\".  They have a job to do too, and just because they are their own boss doesn't mean that it doesn't take a ton of discipline to keep yourself on track.  You owe her the apology.", "YTA.\n\nHer life isn't less important to yours. And that is what you are implying.", "YTA and immature. Having kids doesn't make the world revolve around you or mean others have to drop their hobbies to spend time with you.", "YTA. You have no right to judge the way she lives her life or how she spends her time. It's ridiculous to insinuate that taking classes is \"reliving high school\" -- people take classes all throughout their life for all kinds of reasons and it's not reliving high school. Some people enjoy continuing to learn, to better themselves, to stay in shape. Her obligations are not less important than your own, and you're being the childish one. Just because your obligation is a child, doesn't mean that you should act like one.", "YTA. Taking classes as an adult does not make your friend immature, which is what you seem to be implying. If she's working from home she's likely taking all these classes in part for mental and social exercise. Get over yourself.", "YTA\n\nYou're both busy. Just because she's busy with things you don't view as being worth her time, doesn't mean she has to ditch one for you. It would be nice if she did but she doesn't want to. \n\nIf anyone is stuck with a high school mentality, it's you. Her life doesn't revolve around your schedule.", "Yep, YTA. She works and has no children. If she wants to take paint by toe classes, it's her business. Are you upset she can indulge her interests? Get over yourself.", "YTA. You\u2019re the childish one here.  You\u2019re requiring flexibility of your friends when you have none to give. So what that she has time for classes. These are now part of her schedule. \n\nDo you want to skip out on some of your child\u2019s activities so you can meet up with your friend? No? Then why should she.  \n\nPs. I have a child as well, and would never expect this from my childless friends.\n\nEdit: Also, not clear how any of this has to do with high school. She\u2019s an adult with commitments that she\u2019s honouring. You\u2019re asking her to be flaky so that she can meet your schedule.", "YTA completely. Taking classes to expand her horizons is not a \u201chigh school\u201d thing and, as someone who WFH, is a great way to get out of the house and make friends. You suggesting 3 dates that don\u2019t work is not ridiculous, it\u2019s called being an adult and having a busy schedule. My friends and I have to plan 1-2 months out in order to see people sometimes.", "YTA. She can do whatever she wants since she has no kids, It\u2019s her life after all.

Just because you're mad your friend has a life outside of you, there's no reason to insult her. I'd say you owe her an apology (and you do) but I imagine the friendship is past saving- if I were her, I'd have no interest in making time to see you again.", "YTA. This is surely just made up, right?\n\nShe may work from home but she *still works*. She has deadlines to meet, she has to ship products by specific times or else she won\u2019t retain customers. She can\u2019t drop her work just because you\u2019re suddenly available.\n\nAs for classes, I imagine she\u2019s paying for these. If she misses one, I doubt she\u2019s getting the money back for it. If you want to pay for her missed class then suggest that to her, but that isn\u2019t accounting for the fact she also may end up very behind if she misses a class. \n\nShe isn\u2019t the one acting like a high school student here, you are. You can\u2019t seem to look beyond the fact that the world doesn\u2019t revolve around you and your schedule. Your friend has a busy life, as do you. It happens in adulthood. Why does it all have to be on your schedule? Why can\u2019t your husband look after your child whilst you go out with your friend? Why can\u2019t you bring your child with you to meet up with your friend? Why can\u2019t your friend come and hang out at yours?\n\nI get having a child makes things more difficult, but you can\u2019t be mad that over nearly 2 years you only made the effort to meet-up with her a few times and now she has a life outside of you. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve found time to see family, go shopping, etc.., there are loads of baby friendly activities two adults can do when they hang out.", "I didn\u2019t bother reading this entire post .

Have some self-awareness.", "The story is probably false or written to attract attention.  \nSo here we really have a 33-year-old woman throwing a tantrum like a child because her \"friend\" (I use quotation marks because the OP describes her friend's professional success with contempt) doesn't necessarily have the time to spend with her?  \nOp, please, if you see my comment: if Sasha would have the time to spend with you, the place you'd have to meet would have to be at home because it's easier for you since you have a child, or somewhere else as long as Sasha chooses a place where children are accepted under the constraint that you refuse?  \nIf so, can you please explain your reasoning?", "YTA - You owe HER an apology. But, will you admit you were wrong and apologize?", "YTA\n\nYour friend has interests and activities that don\u2019t involve you. That\u2019s how adult friendships work. \n\nYou\u2019re the one that needs to grow up.", "YTA. You are a mom and that is a valid way to live your life. But she is not less of an adult for following her interests and being a different adult. It sounds like she created her own job and is successful and that she is filling her life with things that give her joy. From what I gathered, she didn't complain when you didn't have time to hang out because you were becoming a mom... and you are being a bit of an asshole to just expect her to be free at the times you are..\n You have a busy schedule and so does she. I am sorry, but you are dismissing her choice of life and basically saying yours is more valid and important. You can't be flexible but she has to be?... you owe her an apology.", "Yikes, girl. Miserly loves company, and thankfully for Sasha she saw that and hopefully bolted for good.\n\nYTA, and an insufferable one at that.", "100%  this Op YTA", "> how do you think she spends her time? waiting for you to be free to hang out?\n\nTHIS. OMG THIS.", "I think OP is one of those mothers that think having a child is mandatory for \u2018becoming an adult\u2019.", "u/SecretTimeTrash preach it!! This response is perfect. OP def owes her \"friend\" an apology.\n\nYTA", "OP is the kind of person people without kids can\u2019t stand. Our lives don\u2019t revolve around your (child\u2019s) schedule. YTA I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she stopped talking to you. Who needs enemies with friends like you?", "Yes, why would I be? If it sounds clunky it\u2019s because English isn\u2019t my first language", "Nice catch. We\u2019re probably all calling some fat 30 something dude an asshole for a made up story lmao", "Really? Because it sounds a lot tnis post\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/125wu3h/aita_for_telling_my_f30_friend_f31_that_its_time/?rdt=52138", "It doesn\u2019t sound clunky. It\u2019s just way too delusional to be a real thing written by a real woman on planet earth.", "I thought this sounded familiar!", "That\u2019s crazy similar! But yeah, that wasn\u2019t me", "Girl, please.", "Oop caught being an liar AND an asshole", "You got caught in a lie pretend all you want but people know this isn't real.", "LMAO! It's exactly the same wording and same names \ud83d\ude02It's official. She needs to break up with you as a friend.", "Yeah, I'm not buying.\n\nEven some sentences are the same. lol", "Ma\u2019am, it might be time to get a life, no?", "It's literally word for word", "Yeah I don't buy that, it was you, the post are more than crazy similar they're about identical"]}
