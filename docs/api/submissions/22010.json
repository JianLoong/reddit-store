If Mom had kicked her to her bio dad after she displayed signs of jealousy then we would have no relationship and my sister would have more mental health problems from that trauma.  Sounds like your brother faced some tough parenting moments and instead of rising to the occasion, he took the easy way.

Wouldn\u2019t blame her for being upset if her dad outright said he wants to start fresh, can you imagine how they\u2019d been acting towards the niece in the lead up to this?", "Yes, but I don't like the way he says he wants to start new with his new family. Like he already has a daughter who is part of the family, he has to think about her too. \n\nAnd like I said, what if he didn't have the option of her going to her mother?\n\nHe would make her live with her grandparents? Or his brother? \n\nHe also doesn't say anything about his wife, like why she is letting this happen with her stepdaughter?\n\nIn general, there is a lot of information missing, and the adults don't seem to be dealing with the situation in a healthy way", "The baby seemingly won\u2019t have family ever \n\n\nThat the niece needs family is completely irrelevant for the point and nothing I refuted", "Because they are both completely delusional?", "No but you can keep talk of the son out of your language when confronting the father. Saying your punishing the baby until the father loves his niece isn\u2019t going to give you the outcome you want. OP needs to keep the threats and argument about the dad not the kid.", "It\u2019s a metaphor. But apparently I wasn\u2019t clear. Let explain myself better.\n\nThe person you are responding to never said that OP\u2019s brother is right. Or that the little girl should be homeless.\n\nThey are saying that OP is throwing his anger at the wrong person (the little baby boy)", "She's not homeless!! That is super dramatic.", "Yeah I wanna know in what way they don\u2018t get along. At this point there are just too many things we have to make assumptions on and no clear picture at all. My mom is a social worker and through that I have seen teenagers who have relentlessly bullied and even physically harmed their younger siblings and not getting along with one parent often just meant they didn\u2018t like having any kind of rules put in place by that parent. I\u2018m not saying this has to be the case here though. \n\nI mostly just feel bad for the little adopted boy who hasn\u2018t done anything to anyone and is part of this whole mess and even gets blamed for it", "They aren\u2019t taking the anger out on the baby. Sounds like they\u2019re going low contact with the brother. What are they going to do? Take the baby away? The niece is hurting and needs family. I think their feelings are valid in this circumstance. They have an obligation to the niece who is 14 and getting kicked out cause her family is \u201cstarting fresh\u201d without her.", "How is OP delusional?", "I don't see anywhere that OP is 'throwing anger' at a baby. But he is cutting off his brother which means he won't have a relationship with his new nephew. Can't have one without the other.", "I know what a metaphor is. It just doesn't apply here because OP's anger is clearly at the brother. The baby is just collateral, because of course the family would not want to interact with his parents after they acted so callous.", "Oh yeah, she has her mom's abusive home to return to, how silly of me.", "Never said something else\n\n\nThey do comment on the fact that they will never be able to look at the baby without being angry. Woch is my Problem with op so maybe u stop making up a strawman", "Letting ur anger out on a baby is pretty fitting imo", "Baby will \u201cnever be part of the family\u201d and OP contacted everybody on order to get his brother cut out.\n\nBaby boy is going to be alone with abusive parents and no support network", "I\u2019m sure that cutting out any relationship with the baby and pushing the rest of the family to do the same is the best idea. It\u2019s not like Op\u2019s brother is a proven abusive parent who let a child homeless.  \n\nWhat could go wrong when the baby boy is old enough to make something that disappoints his parents and has no support network to survive the subsequent downfall.", "Not getting along is abusive?", "But the anger is at the brother. The baby is just collateral.", "Isn't an adult allowed to choose who they love?\n\nHe doesn't love his nephew. Why force him?", "And is OP supposed to be yet another adult who fawns and cares for the baby at the expense of the niece? Like, who is supposed to have her best interest at mind.", "Do you understand what it takes for a parent to have sole custody?"]}
