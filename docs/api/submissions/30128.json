NTA.\n\nWhy do they not like your son?", "NTA- I was one of those kids that wasn't included.\n\nI absolutely noticed every single time.\nYou can tell your wife that.", "NTA- I was in your shoes many years ago. My oldest was born (2nd grandchild on my husbands side). They had said for years they raised their boys (3 boys no girls) and they wanted girls (they also had 2 foster/adopted daughters that were way younger than their sons). So their first grandchild was a girl the golden grandchild, despite living with her mother (divorced deadbeat dad) she was showered with everything. Then a few years later we had our son. I refused to allow them in the delivery room and they treated him like crap. When they came to the hospital they didn't even ask to hold him and barely looked at him (according to DH, I was out of it). When he was a few months old (yes you read that right they didn't see us again until he was a few months old, even though they lived just a few miles down the road), my DH carried him in, took him out of his carseat and proceeded to try and sit him on her lap, she almost let him roll off but DH caught him. One of us held him the rest of the time. Same attitude for 2 1/2 years until our daughter was born. Suddenly they want to see the kids more, but all that meant was they wanted to see our daughter and would encourage our son to play in another room with their foster kid. (I limited these visits). 1 1/2 years go by and that Christmas (they ask us to come celebrate) and we agree to come over a week b4 christmas since work schedules and such. They proceed to try and get my almost 4 year old to play again in another room, my DH says are they opening anything (thinking they would then have something to play with, otherwise I had small things in my bag). \"Of course we got them gifts\" they said. They hand my son 1 box and hand my daughter one. He opened what ended up being clothing- I outfit thats it. She opened her box and it was a dress up set. They again try to shoe him into the other room. Why? Because they had much more for her to open. H\\*\\*\\* to the NO. I packed them up right then and there and told them, they would treat my kids the same or would not see them. My son cried, because what 4 year old wants clothes but especially when his sister gets tons of toys. We went years LC/NC. They eventually moved several states away, and we had our 3rd child (another boy). We hardly heard from them, they would occasionally call and would send my Husband a birthday card and a Christmas card. Years go by and DH\"S GGMA passes away (she was awesome, she would send homemade candy and toys every year to every grandkid. Until all the grandkids convinced her that it was costing her more in shipping than she was spending on gifts and candy. So she would send us the money and I would by whatever she told me to for the kids, wrap and put it under the tree from GGMA). The following year, my middle son who each year would get a card from GGMA for birthday, didn't get his card (of course as she had passed) we explained why and he was sad but remembered. His brothers birthday is next and no card of course, but suddenly on daughters she gets a card from DH parents. DH says just let it go, maybe they are thinking since GGMA is gone they will start to send the kids cards. Ok fine, I let it go. But next year rolls around and boys are forgotten again but not daughter. I didn't open it, just RETURN TO SENDER. We get a call from BIL asking if I had a problem or did GM do something to offend me. (not my husband you notice, me). DH told his brother, \"we told them we will NOT allow them to treat Daughter better than her brothers\" His brother said he didn't understand, and we informed him that last year they sent her a card but forgot the boys, and that this year they did it again. That we let it go the year before but wouldn't again. They tried to claim they sent them, I got on the phone and yelled NO YOU DID NOT. That our Middle son whose BDAY is first in the year, always was so excited to get cards from GGMA and he would always look and was so disappointed so I know they did not, and that I would bring in my oldest if they wanted to ask him but I could tell them he didn't either. So no cards no more. We are back to them sending DH cards and thats it. I am perfectly fine with it. (We have since had our 4th who is 11. He has never gotten anything from them and only met them once). They will drive right past us and not even tell us they are near. I am fine with it as my family is great and my kids do not miss what they have never had. DH loves my family and barely misses his. (mostly his little brother). Don't let them cause drama between the kids. Kids know, mine have known for years. They know who they are but the also know they are not nice people and I never bad mouthed them, they learned all on their own (at least the oldest, and they have I assume told the younger 2 because they show no interest in knowing them)", "My grandmother absolutely played favorites. I resented the favorite grandchild when I was young but, despised grandma the older I got.", "All biological.", "NTA and if they don't stop you might need to get creative your wife won't back you up.  Especially if they start telling everyone they can't give gifts because you complained it was unfair. (It is unfair but they will put it on you.) You might need to discreetly give your son money or things when they only give your daughter stuff. I'm not sure how old you're daughter and son are but if they are old enough you can explain it to them.", "They want you to be the bag guy to your daughter by splitting it instead of them. Wow, they are trash people, lol NTA", "How does your oldest feel when she gets something but sees her brother didn\u2019t?\n\nDepending on your answer, you might also have a problem to tackle with your daughter now either feeling guilty from being the favorite and seeing her brother hurt, or your daughter feeling entitled and superior/bragging about the money she got and he didn\u2019t.", "I\u2019d be more concerned about your wife. She\u2019s the parent her and it sounds like she\u2019s supporting this division.", "Honestly the bigger problem is your wife. If she doesn\u2019t see how this affects your kid she is either incredibly callous or an idiot. I can\u2019t imagine thinking my family playing favorites is okay under any circumstances", "Maybe. But think of the message she's sending to your son.   She's saying it's okay to treat him as less, which can read as she agrees with her parents.  \n\nShe cares more about her comfort (not confronting her parents) than her son.", "This would be a bit of an explanation if they didn't know what to buy for a boy--but money is pretty much unisex.\n\nThey could also be thinking the teenager needs \"stuff\" more than a pre-teen, but I'm sure you could go back a few years and see that they were giving her more at the same age as your son.\n\nI can only echo what others have said.  Instead of making demands of wife or in-laws, ask the probing questions.  Starting with \"do you love your son/grandson?\"", "it's the \"message\" she's sending him if he's overheard his mom excusing her parent's actions and saying \"it's no big deal what they've done\". I can feel his little heart breaking way over here.", "Sorry but your wife's behavior really sucks here.  If she won't stand up for her own son, what does she stand for?  Is she this cowardly in all situations or just dealing with your son?\n\nThis is causing a divide that will ripple across time.  Cracks now in marriage, cracks within siblings, cracks with grandparents/kids. Resentment is powerful and will grow.\n\nETA: she doesn't seem to stand up for you either.  You shouldn't be facing increased resentment from her parents. Apparently, she's offering you up too!  She needs to stand with you and the kids.  It's sad and I hope she can self reflect on her non-actions.", "To be fair to her, they've been conditioning her since birth to just take it, and view it as normal. It might be to them, but it is objectively bullshit. How old are your kids? If old enough, your daughter should be standing up for her brother too.", "Maybe leave your wife behind with her parents. The fact she doesn\u2019t stand up for her son is appalling. \n\nThis is an issue I feel very strongly about as I was treated in a similar way when I was in my early teens and no one did anything about it.", "UpdateMe", "You're only TA for letting this behavior go on along as it has. The kids don't need these kinds of grandparents in their lives. From now on, they don't need to see the kids.", "NTA, you are a good father, stay strong.", "It's a huge deal. My grandparents did the same with my brother. Tell them it's equal or it's nothing. Mind you they'll stash money in bank accounts for her for when she's older, but you need to teach her that their behavior is unacceptable and that she and her brother both deserve their love and generosity. BTW, my DIL's father did that--preferring her to her brother--and she doesn't talk to him at all because of it. \n\nAlso, your wife needs to wake up. I'd be voting to cut contact with the grandparents as long as they show such flagrant favoritism. Sorry, but your wife and her parents are all assholes. \n\nNTA", "NTA I was the unfavored kid and it damages you.\n\nWas your mom the favored kid?  My sister never thought she was even though it was painfully obvious.  She just assumed she was better.  Your daughter may go that direction if you don't stop this.  But I wonder if mom was the favorite and doesn't see it as a big deal because from her end it was fine", "NTA so it\u2019s none to all. MIL needs to be cut off. No way in hell I\u2019m going to allow her to cause a divide amongst my children and make my son feel like crap. She wouldn\u2019t be seeing my kids anymore or at least until she learned how to be an actual grandma\u2026 auntie as well. A whole bunch of losers", "NTA. Your family is single handedly creating and funding a civil war between your kids. This kind of favoritism is bizarre and gross.", "NTA.  Your wife is part of the problem.  This should have stopped long ago.  Your wife should have told them, \u201cNo more not treating the kids equally.  If you give something to one when you are here, you give to both equally.  Next time you leave out _____ or give him substantially less, you will be asked to leave and not come back.  Your past behavior disgusts me.\u201d", "It\u2019s not just the gifts-it\u2019s the attitude. I guarantee you that your son can pick up on it, even if he wasn\u2019t already told that he\u2019s the least favorite. I would go NC and deny these horrible people any access to ALL the kids until they learn how to be decent people. NTA", "NTA. If you can do something really nice for the family, do it and leave your in-laws out. A big Christmas dinner would be good. Make sure they know about it and if they complain point out that this is exactly how your son feels every time they do that to him. Ask them how it feels to be less than nothing to people who should love and care about them.", "NTA. How on earth can these people be so cruel to a child? I don\u2019t understand how parents or  grandparents can show favoritism. Just no words.", "NTA I am scrupulous in treating my grandchildren equally. I will not play favourites my parents used to play favourites with the grandkids and I would then treat the unfavoured kids so each receives the same amount", "My bff's mom did this. She was so, so, poor, but every holiday or get together, she'd give only the boys money. That's crap. My bff finally told her the same thing:all or nothing at all. My bff had 6 kids, 4 of them girls. It's sexist AF, and I detest this practice.", "NTA Kids are not stupid. That kind of treatment in the formative years can have lifelong impact on relationships. That your wife is blind to the favoritism and the impact that it is already having is a big red flag. Especially since you pretty much gave her no choice to but to see what is happening. Frankly, I would go low contact with the in-laws. They are ridiculous and very sad as grandparents. To me, their influence and kid specific participation would not be welcome.", "NTA is there a manual on how to give kids complexes? It sounds like your MIL read it.", "Same situation with my mom's death earlier this year. My daughter - the not favorite grandchild - didn't even go to the burial. I'd been VVLC for years because of the favoritism.", "My sister was the favorite and when I pointed that out I was told I was imagining things and that we were both loved equally.  Which is a bit hard to believe when one kid gets $50 for their birthday and the other younger kid gets $500 (not even the argument that you get more as you get older works for that one).\n\nI read somewhere that if you have a kid saying you are favoring the other one, listen, because even if you think it's not true, it is.  I was told it was because of behavior that she got more but that's weird because I was much better behaved and our grades were both great, although she's good at social studies/history type things and I'm good at math/science, so it wasn't that either.\n\nMy sister was a spoiled brat but moved far away and now I'm the one taking care of mom.  Go figure.", "It\u2019s HER parents", "Since your wife is okay with her son being emotionally damaged, then it\u2019s up to you to deal with this. Be firm, non negotiable. All or nothing. Your MIL sounds extremely immature. NTA but your MIL and wife certainly are.", "Yeah, sorry OP, but kids hear WAAYYYY more than adults **ever** give them credit for.", "I'm guessing it's because the granddaughter is a girl.  Believe or not, some people DO favour girls over boys, for whatever reason.  And this would be why OP's wife doesn't see it as a problem either.  Especially if the IL's only had female children."]}
