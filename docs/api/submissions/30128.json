Obviously what they were doing was shitty but all you accomplished was pissing them off. Now all of the adults involved are angry at each other and I doubt your kids understand why.\n\nThe proper way to handle this was to let them keep giving her money. any time they give her money you sit your kids down together. Ask daughter how much she got and then give the same amount to son. Then explain to them why you are doing this and why what their aunt is doing is wrong.\n\nGive it enough time and the result is both of your kids will stop respecting aunt and uncle for being shitty. Your kids still get to have presents/fun money. And this does not all blow up into big family drama.\n\nIdk why everyone is so obsessed with direct confrontation when they think they are in the right. \n\nA little social manipulation goes a long way.

Good for you for establishing that boundary - now you're going to have to fight with your wife to make sure it stands.  There are times that equal treatment just won't work out (one child is in ballet and one is in tap - you don't buy them identical dance shoes) but for the most part, you're right - those kids need to be treated equally.  It will mean the world to your son that you are standing up for him.", "NTA\n\nMy narcissist grandma tried to pull that shit. She came with presents for my older sister and nothing for me.

My grandpa is my brothers godfather, but it was clear he would've never took him in if something happened.\n\nMy mom and dad stood up for him and called them out multiple times. I asked my grandparents why they treat him poorly, why he never gets gifts like me. They don't want to see it. They believe they treat everyone the same. They don't. I don't know why, they just hate every male person in our family, even uncle's, my father, my mothers partners after divorce, my ex bf.

Knowing the kids ages and that you don't expect kids at different stages to be treated the same, there's no way for your in-laws to justify their favoritism. It's natural for people to be closer to some people than others even within a family. However, adults should always take care not to display favoritism. If your in-laws truly love your daughter, they shouldn't be doing anything that could drive a wedge between her and her brother or anyone else in the family.", "What is your partner doing to support you?

I'm guessing you've seen evidence of this with the SILs sons and not just your own.\n\nThere may not be much the ILs can do to favorite your younger daughter over your son currently. But it won't take that long for that to change. I'd be surprised it it takes even until she's 8 to start seeing it (if you can't quash it before then). By 6 or 7 is likely.\n\nAnd if your son is struggling with their treatment towards him now, seeing them starting it with his younger sister too will be worse.", "Yes.

Family can definitely be toxic.", "The favorited daughter is actually more introverted than my son. My son used to get into physical fights with his cousin (SILs kid) when they were growing up. They're only one year apart. It seems like they would always blame my son for their fights. Other than that, that's all I can think of.", "It was more of a rhetorical question for you, but maybe something you should ask your wife. You're being a good dad, I wish mine cared like you do. My mom is now dead and I have mostly resentment for her.", "That could be enough. Once a family member is dubbed \"the bad one\" it can stick.

I just can't understand how some people don't realize this.", "I watched these two kids growing up, his cousin was definitely the instigator in most of the cases but yes, they'd typically get in a fight and the cousin would end up be the one crying.
