All marital funds are being kept away from it in well-documented ways, as well. She will never have to pay part of the 'mortgage'/rent since I'm technically renting from my parents in this case.\n\nMy dad presented this to me as a wedding gift. My fianc\u00e9e is extremely angry over this and says this isn't a gift to us both since she doesn't own the home. I pointed out that this is an incredibly generous offer and that this is still her place of residence despite her name not being on it. She can't believe I would accept the offer and I can't believe she would turn it down.\n\nEverything about the house is perfect and I don't think I can let it go. but she's issued an ultimatum.

Your fiance is right on this part - she didn't get input in the house you'll spend a good chunk of your lives in at the start of the marriage, it's only your dream house, not hers.

At 25, I know very few people can say that and I'm very grateful that I'm one of them, but it isn't without help.\n\nMy parents and I have been discussing him helping me buy a home for the past year, give or take a few months. I was still searching for something I loved and we were still working out logistics but things have finally fallen into place. Both mine and my father's names will be on the deed and the lease. My fianc\u00e9e's will be left off. This is for a couple reasons. Her credit isn't great. It's also simply a precautionary measure. A prenup will protect me in the case of a divorce, but we want to make absolutely sure that the house remains untouched. All marital funds are being kept away from it in well-documented ways, as well. She will never have to pay part of the 'mortgage'/rent since I'm technically renting from my parents in this case. \n\nMy dad presented this to me as a wedding gift. My fianc\u00e9e is extremely angry over this and says this isn't a gift to us both since she doesn't own the home. I pointed out that this is an incredibly generous offer and that this is still her place of residence despite her name not being on it. She can't believe I would accept the offer and I can't believe she would turn it down. \n\nEverything about the house is perfect and I don't think I can let it go. but she's issued an ultimatum.

Not sure if I'm remembering that detail correctly, but if I am, WTF?!? \n\nI get that people don't like when ultimatums are offered, but I totally understand her point of view. I would not be able to live in that hostile home environment either. It'd be equal partnership, or I'm out.

The argument here isn't one of semantics.
