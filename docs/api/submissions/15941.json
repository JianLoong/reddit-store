Throwaway. \n\nI 24f am engaged to my fiance Drew 27m. We are so excited to get married very early next year but planning has been hell for us bc of my mom. \n\nI am her only daughter. She split from my dad when I was 10 due to DV. Im not sure if this is the reason she is how she is, but I am not a therapist to tell. Ever since she has been extremely controlling over me. If I didn't clean my room she would break valuable sentimental items and say \"look what you made me do\". If I liked boys I was a whore. When I was SAed she blamed me for not following her rules. When she made me file a lawsuit and did not get the settlement amount she wanted, I was letting people take advantage of me again and weak. She never apologized as she was \"caring for her child\" I can forgive her bc she had a really rough past but I can never forget. \n\nWhen it comes to wedding planning, she needs to control everything. I work a full time demanding job, so all my free time goes into planning with her \"helping\". The purple I want is disgusting, the centerpieces are ugly, the venue is not good enough, and now my wedding invitations. When I got samples months ago, she loved the ones I chose. About a month ago when ordering, she approved everything. Now, she says that they are ugly and incorrect and I need to buy new ones. My fiance and I just bought our first home, so money is a little tight and buying these were not exactly in the budget but there was a sale. I told her that is not happening, as I love them, its my wedding, and the money was already spent. This did not carry over well, and she started yelling at me which started to trigger my anxiety. I told her so, and hung up the phone. She then called me back about an hour later, I picked up thinking we calmed ourselves down. But instead she went off calling me a complete embarrassment and a disrespectful bitch and she did not care if I wanted to harm myself as I was manipulating her. She then threatened to ruin my wedding or make sure my family does not show up if I go through with my invitations. She then hung up on me and I had a panic attack.\n\nAt this point, I am completely done. I do not want someone so negative in my life as much as she is. I wanted to ban her from the wedding, but as she is my mother, I don't think I can do so. She loves party planning, and as I am the only daughter, it was extremely important to her. She is extremely sick as well, so this distracts her from everything going on with her. I just cannot take it anymore when it comes to controling every aspect of MY special day.

Don't allow her anywhere near your wedding at all. \n\nMy advice frankly is to go NO Contact and get counseling. If you have to have your Mother there I suggest hiring security for the event.

I have engagement photos from a shoot just he and I did and those are the photos in my house and the ones I show our little girl. My mother has our phsycial wedding album we got from the photographer on display in her office. Zero self awareness to this day. It was the best day of her life aparently. None of her wedding photos are in her house anywhere. I was 24 when I got married too and girl let me tell you, some people cannot let the day be about anyone other than themselves. My hubby is planning a vow renewal for our 10th anniversary because HE didn't get the wedding we would have wanted (not a $35,000 monstrosity, we wanted small Church and the In'N'Out Truck). Girlie, I say this with love. Protect your special moments, they do not come back. Mom is a guest and if she isn't grateful for that put her in her place NOW.

Really, really abusive. And I'm so sorry if no one has ever validated you by telling you that, and telling you that you were really brave and strong to make it through a childhood and adolescence being treated like that with your mental health remotely intact.  You were abused. For years. In fact, the things she said to you are pretty much a stereotypical SCRIPT for abusers: being violent with you (yes, even if she didn't hit you, breaking your things to scare you and keep you in line is perpetrating violence against you) and then telling you that you \"made her\" do it? Oh honey, no one can \"make\" someone else do something, especially not when it's a child and an adult. She was 100% responsible for her own behaviour. As was the person who SA'ed you. \n\nI want to just be super clear: **in all of this, you have done absolutely nothing wrong. You were a victim. You HAVE BEEN a victim**. And you will never, ever be an AH for deciding that you want nothing to do with the person who victimised and abused you for all those years. It doesn't matter if she's your mother. She lost the right to any relationship with you a long time ago, by not treating you with the love and care a mother is supposed to. \n\nI won't tell you how to handle this; you've had enough of being controlled and manipulated in your life. But please just know that there is no way in any universe that you would be an AH if you cut her off to any degree - low contact, no contact, whatever feels safest and best to you.

Or would you tell her it was the person who made the decision to hurt her's fault? Because Your mother made the wrong choice. You could have followed every single rule to the damn letter and if your attacker was going to attack they would have regardless. We aren't at fault when someone else assaults us. What we wear doesn't mean we are at fault. You could be bare ass naked doesn't mean it's your fault. If you said \"I don't know, I rather not, I'm uncomfortable, etc\" it still means no.

It's your wedding and marriage. Not hers. If she wants to be like this let her. Tbh it screams the narcissist prayer (google it) I can't diagnose but she definitely has a mental illness and your not in charge of treating it or enabling her.\n\nEnjoy your wedding the way you want it done.
