When I (34f) was growing up Id pass out occasionally. They never could figure out why. Cut to college and my Junior year it turned into full blow seizures/passing out. Senior year I went into cardiac arrest. The doctors were really bad in the state where I lived and put me on 20 pills a day, said it was anxiety and all sorts of shit. Through all of this I finished college from home ( my school does that for students), got a job that knew my issues and were cool, met and moved in with my now husband to a different state. It would happen when I was driving, Id not feel good and know I had like 5 minutes before a full blown seizure. So Id pull over. Have one. Be tired. Go home. Went to the ER for one and went into cardiac arrest again. A doctor in the new state FINALLY figured it out after 5 years of that. I had heart surgery and have been fine since. Turns out I had a genetic heart disorder/SVT. Heart could go from 86 beats to 264 in seconds while sitting.\n\nNow here is where I want to know if I am the asshole. My sister (24) is going through the same thing. She saw my doctor and they said yeah you need the surgery. She refuses to get it because she might die. Well she will die without it too. What makes me so angry is she dropped out of college, she lives with mom, doesn't work, does literally nothing! Mom wakes her up with breakfast in bed every fucking morning. She does no chores because they make her tired. Tried online college but it just 'wasn't for her.' Mom tried to get her qualified for disability and my sister wouldn't fill out the paperwork. She is wasting her youth just sitting at home and playing video games all day. I've tried talking to her about it  gently and she keeps saying she has to focus on her mental health first. She does see a therapist regularly and even they have begun telling her look this wont get better. My mother is getting older and should be enjoying her golden years, not talking care of an adult. I just want to scream at her \"If mum dies what's your plan? You can't support yourself and you wont be living with me.\" I know that sounds cruel. I already essentially raised 3 babies( siblings 10, 11, and 12 years younger than me)  and am not having kids for a reason. So WIBTA if we had a 'come to Jesus' moment? \\*not religious just can't think of a better phrase.\n\nEdit: I want to thank you all for your insight. This actually has helped me a lot. Reading some of these comments I began crying and realized it's time to step away, go LC for awhile, and begin therapy again for the stress and childhood trauma. She will live how she sees fit and just because I 'raised' her doesn't mean I can dictate any of that. I just love her and am worried. It is what it is.\n\nEdit again: Apparently I shouldn't have use the term seizure. They were cardiac events. I have been defibrillated two times. 1st time in Mississippi age 21, second was a hospital in Maine age 25. I was cleared by a doctor to drive.

Now when someone else is sick, they're being babied, but you never were. Sounds like you raised \\*her\\* and she won't listen to you now. \n\nPlease do see a therapist of your own. If this is how your sister wants to live out her life, then that's her choice. YOU have to make choices for the one person you have control over -- yourself. You can't force your sister's actions, but you can manage and control your \\*reaction\\*. Work on that, get help with that. Distance yourself. \n\nFind your own peace with this. Make memories with her if you want. If she's too scared to get the surgery, then she may need a different therapist now. \n\nConvey your feelings, not what you want her to do -- you want to see her happy and having a fuller life, not to be limited by her health. Tell her that, don't focus on her actions, but how you feel. Maybe go to a joint counseling session so you can both safely express yourselves.", "This is a tough call. If you want to stage an intervention, you have to have your family on your side first. You need to get your mom to make your sister be independant instead of babied.", "Nah\n\nYou're allowed to be mad that she's taking up your mother's life as much as she is, and she's allowed to be scared of the risks of open heart surgeries. \n\nDon't scream at her though. You and your mother need to sit her down and calmly have a conversation where she is asked what her plan is if/when your mother passes, because she isn't your responsibility. Make it as clear as possible that she isn't your responsibility.", "NTA, but I think a healthier response is to simply put some distance. This obviously hurts you, but ultimately you cannot control how two other adults decide to live their lives. Your mother is enabling your sister and doing her NO favors for the reason you said - what will happen to your sister when mom is gone? Your sister\u2019s excuse that she\u2019s prioritizing her \u201cmental health\u201d is absurd, because playing video games all day is NOT how mental health prioritization works. Sounds like she\u2019s actually doing the opposite of prioritizing mental health.", "Nah. The fact is that it is your sister's body and health. If she doesn't want surgery then no one can or should force her. Your mom and sister are both content with how things are. They aren't going to change because you want them to. However nicely pointing out to your mother and sister that eventually your mother won't be able to do every thing for your sister is fair. Tell them you are concerned and tell them you suggest they develop a plan. Only if you are asked to become her caretaker do you point out that you won't do it. Just calmly say no and stick with it. If they don't ask - don't say anything about that.", "I don't think you WBTA, but I would tread carefully with comparing your experience to hers.  While the situation is similar, people deal with things differently.  I don't think pointing out to her that you were able to achieve things that she can't will be helpful.    \nI think talking to her about what would happen if your mother passes and telling her she won't be living with you is fine.  Saying that you were able to do these things while experiencing the same medical conditions won't.", "Yikes. Tough call. Do consider that even though your mom is doing everything for her, your mom may not have it any other way. Even though she\u2019s not well, I think your sister is being TA here.", "NTA - your sister is absolutely the one in the wrong here. However I\u2019m not so sure having it out with her is going to change anything. If she doesn\u2019t want to change nothing you say will make a difference so go in with realistic expectations", "NTA for your concern for your sister.\n\nYWBTA going in guns blazing as to her rescue. It's not YOUR place to handle it. Your Mom really needs to stop enabling and coddling her self destructive behavior \n\nAnd refusing to even fill out the disability forms when she's living on your mom's dime? That is definitely being a selfish AH.", "This is very difficult. She does seem to be setting herself up for a sad and unfulfilling life where at the same time she taking advantage of ur parents and expecting things to come to her instead of having to take them for herself (which if she survives she will have to do eventually). However, if the threat of dying is imminent, i would think she should be able to spend that little time left being selfish and self absorbed if that is what she pleases and if others (ur parents) are willing to accommodate that.\n\nIm a bit confused if ur asking if u would be the asshole if u told her to get her shit together or if u told her to get the life saving surgery. \n\nIf it is to get her shit together I would need to know more about the nature of the condition, specifically the life expectancy with it. And, from my perspective, this does sound immensely hard to go through, and u sound very strong in ur ability to persevere through the same thing. It doesnt sound like the craziest thing to me that she is going to the path she is given her circumstances. \n\nIf it is to tell her she should get the surgery you would not be the asshole if you did it in a way that she can tell ur doing it from a place of love and doesnt feel attacked. Maybe showing that u know what it is like, that u went through the exact same thing, and that like u said she may die with it, but she WILL die without it, and that u dont want to lose her, but understand her hesitancy", "If you want to start this conversation have it with your mom first. Ask her what she thinks the plan is. Then speak to your sister with your mom. If she doesn\u2019t want to get involved then back off. It\u2019s their problem, not yours. NTA", "NAH. I mean, you're not wrong and you make very, very good points about how this effects the wellbeing of both your mom and your sister, but ultimately you can't unstick her from whatever she's stuck in right now and you can't make her medical decisions for her. You don't have to be supportive, though. You can opt out, let her know that you're not going to be here for this and will not be supporting her, but that's really where what's fair for you to do ends.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Certainly, tell your sister she will not be ~~leaching off~~ living with you after Mom dies. In fact, tell all your siblings, too.\n\nYour mother is an adult; she has made her own choices. If you are concerned she feels trapped by your sister, discuss that with her.\n\nYour sister is an adult; all you can do is share the information you have and support choices you think are healthy. \n\nYou have to let this sense of responsibility go.", "NTA - i feel your mom is enabling your sister to be lazy and not care if she dies by allowing her to live off of her. Maybe some distance with your sister would be ok, she has made her choice to not care about her life. Don\u2019t stress yourself out over it, it\u2019s not your choice. Your sister is the AH and your mom an enabler. Let them deal with their mess. Focus on you and living your life, there is not much you can do. You have already done so much for your family. I wish many blessings for you as you are such a strong and responsible person. I know that you wanting to have it out with your sister comes from a place of love and wanting her to get better but with your mom enabling yours sister laziness and selfishness, there isn\u2019t much you can do. Even if you had it out, your mom will just keep enabling your sister making it pointless and a waste of time on your end and making you seem like an AH. All you can do is focus on you.

It always amazes me how a person who experiences a situation expects a person in a parallel situation to react the EXACT same way. We don\u2019t get prizes for pushing through a situation, we gain experience. Your experience should be able to offer your sister some sympathy. I am glad you overcame your obstacle in a manner that made you proud. Now let your sister overcome hers with a little support from you.", "Is it even open heart surgery? When they finally figured out that my husband's 'panic attacks' were actually SVT (in his late 40s!) they were able to fix it in a minimally invasive cath lab procedure - outpatient. \n\nJust a guess based on the information here- sounds like she might be using her condition as an excuse not to make any effort at life, and Mom is enabling her mightily.\n\nIf you want to tell your sister that you won't be housing/supporting her in the future, that's fine. Be sure you explain that to your mom too. But beyond explaining what you will and won't do for her in the future, it isn't really your business. Peoples bad choices are still their own choices.", "OP, as a big sister I think that going in guns blazing won't work. It sounds like your sister is very depressed and chooses to avoid/ignore her condition in hopes it'll all work out. She needs a different therapist for sure. Tough love works occasionally for holding people accountable but this isn't about accountability it's literal life or death. \n\n\nIf it were me I would talk to my sister and ask her what makes her so afraid of the surgery versus taking the chance of randomly dropping dead after an episode. \n\nChronic conditions are mentally debilitating. My depression is the worst it's been in 10 years due to long COVID exacerbating my migraines and grief from my younger brother taking his life last year.\n\nA good heart to heart and maybe offer to hold her hand through all this. I can tell you love your sister otherwise you wouldn't be this upset. Empathize and tell her how scared you are for her and how much potential you see in her. I hope things work out for the best for your family and your sister gets the surgery and recovers well.  \n\nYwbta in my opinion if you went in hot and grilled her.", "NTA. Sounds like a classic example of somebody using therapy as a substitute for taking responsibility for themselves.", "NAH, comparing yourself to your sister is never healthy and setting yourself and your sister up for problems. Your sister isn\u2019t an AH for being in a bad place because of these health issues. Just because you were able to push through in the way you have doesn\u2019t make her an AH for being depressed which clearly she is. You\u2019re not an AH for wanting to push her to be more independent and take care of herself but the way you\u2019re coming at it is very unsympathetic. Again, I get you\u2019ve dealt with a similar situation but she is a different person. Just because she\u2019s not handling as well as you feel you did doesn\u2019t make her an AH.\n\nTempted to say Y T A because you\u2019re driving while having problems with seizures / passing out but that\u2019s not the point of this. Seriously though, don\u2019t risk other peoples lives just so you can drive. I have epilepsy and I know it\u2019s frustrating but it is incredibly wrong for you to be driving if you\u2019re still losing consciousness.", "This comment is really good. I had to learn that I can only control myself as well when dealing with my own childhood trauma. It's not easy OP but you will feel better.", "NTA\n\nAlso, I N F O - how are you legally allowed to drive after having a seizure? I know most state laws have improved (eg 6 months seizure free vs 1 year seizure free before getting behind the wheel of a car) but to be able to have your license and allowed to drive immediately after a seizure? How is this possible? Asking as I had 1-2 small seizures a year in high school and couldn\u2019t drive for 4 years.", "NTA\n\nHowever distance yourself instead.

You are right. It is time to go back and deal with this. Thank you <3", "[deleted]", "We lived in a very remote town in Maine. Since I had warning they were happening, usually 5 minutes (sweating heart raise, watch vibrating alert),  the doctors there approved me to keep my license. When it began I did not drive for months and walked/my boss would pick me up. But after it became regular and they could be predicted they gave the clear to drive.", "I think OP just used an inaccurate term. She isn't having an epileptic-type seizure. SVT can cause *syncope*,which means feeling faint or actually fainting. After a syncope, people are usually OK or may feel tired, but a few minutes rest usually is enough--they don't have a long period of disorientation or grogginess as epileptics often do. Since she has a few minutes warning, she has time to pull over and stop the car.", "I appreciate what you said. I will try to be kinder and more gentle. It's stressful because she has been told when it started for her a few years ago what the answer was to fix it. She is so smart and creative. It just kills me to see her like this.", "I was cleared by the doctor to continue driving after we took a few months to find out how they worked. Once they were predictable, 5 minute warning signs, they cleared me to continue driving. As an adult later you are right that was a dumb call.", "Being a single mother working as a Real Estate Agent to support us. My responsibility was to see her off to work with a lunch I made. Get the kids up. Make sure they all were dressed, fed, off to school with lunch before going myself (my school was understanding and I did summer school every year so I could have a lighter schedule to take care of them. While at summer school for a few hours my grandmother would watch them). Then getting them off the bus and doing homework while I did laundry, cleaned, and so on. Make dinner for them and have it on the table before she walked in from work.", "It is Cardiac Ablation! And exactly that is why I don't get it. You can die, that is true, shit happens on the table. But if it would fix it . . . . I guess I have a very other thinking mind. It's just us as a family. If mom dies there is no one else and she will end up homeless.", "I saw to top specialist on Neurocardio syncope which they thought it was. They said it was anxiety causing the heart rate issue. Cardiac event 1 was when I was living in Mississippi. Cardiac event 2 was when I was living in Maine. Doctors are just high stakes IT guesswork, even more so when you are young and female. Perhaps seizure isn't the right word? I guess cardiac episode is more appropriate. It's like a force restart on a computer. And as for the driving after you feel like you were hit by a bus. Luckily I lived in a small enough town that it was 3 minutes to get home or work.", "So she wasn\u2019t parenting. She was making money and leaving you to parent. I was a single mom for many years, never did I rely on my child/children to make ME lunch or do any of the things you described. \n\nMy point is, stop feeling guilty for your mom. She made her choices and left you to deal with them.  That was never your job and it still isn\u2019t. She was wrong for putting that on you, single or not. Now she\u2019s dealing with her own consequences and you shouldn\u2019t jump in to save her, again.", "[deleted]", "I was defibrillated, twice. 1st time was in Mississippi in school by an EMT(ambulance), heart rate 264. The second was a hospital in Maine, heart rate 259.  I was cleared by a doctor to drive. As an adult now I realize that was a dumb mistake.", "ESH. Your sister obviously sucks. You however were driving with a diagnosed seizure disorder so you're also an asshole for putting the lives of everyone around you at risk. And no the \"I had 5 minutes advanced notice\" doesn't cut it.", "Did you have an ablation?\n\nSVT puts a person at higher risk for Sudden Death Syndrome, at like 5% iirc, which is higher than the surgery risk.\n\nThe doc putting me under for my attempted ablation said SVT will \"most likely not kill you, just ruin your life.\n\nThat said, your sister is milking this.  It may be she is suffering from traumatic depression due to the diagnosis.\n\nI'm also very much shocked you were driving during this.  My doc forbade driving at all due to the fainting."]}
