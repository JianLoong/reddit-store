When I (34f) was growing up Id pass out occasionally. They never could figure out why. Cut to college and my Junior year it turned into full blow seizures/passing out. Senior year I went into cardiac arrest. The doctors were really bad in the state where I lived and put me on 20 pills a day, said it was anxiety and all sorts of shit. Through all of this I finished college from home ( my school does that for students), got a job that knew my issues and were cool, met and moved in with my now husband to a different state. It would happen when I was driving, Id not feel good and know I had like 5 minutes before a full blown seizure. So Id pull over. Have one. Be tired. Go home. Went to the ER for one and went into cardiac arrest again. A doctor in the new state FINALLY figured it out after 5 years of that. I had heart surgery and have been fine since. Turns out I had a genetic heart disorder/SVT. Heart could go from 86 beats to 264 in seconds while sitting.\n\n Now here is where I want to know if I am the asshole. My sister (24) is going through the same thing. She saw my doctor and they said yeah you need the surgery. She refuses to get it because she might die. Well she will die without it too. What makes me so angry is she dropped out of college, she lives with mom, doesn't work, does literally nothing! Mom wakes her up with breakfast in bed every fucking morning. She does no chores because they make her tired. Tried online college but it just 'wasn't for her.' Mom tried to get her qualified for disability and my sister wouldn't fill out the paperwork. She is wasting her youth just sitting at home and playing video games all day. I've tried talking to her about it  gently and she keeps saying she has to focus on her mental health first. She does see a therapist regularly and even they have begun telling her look this wont get better. My mother is getting older and should be enjoying her golden years, not talking care of an adult. I just want to scream at her \"If mum dies what's your plan? You can't support yourself and you wont be living with me.\" I know that sounds cruel. I already essentially raised 3 babies( siblings 10, 11, and 12 years younger than me)  and am not having kids for a reason. So WIBTA if we had a 'come to jesus' moment? \\*not religious just can't think of a better phrase.", "created_utc": 1671629187, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zrlx48/wibta_if_i_had_it_out_with_my_dying_sister/", "score": 40, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Now when someone else is sick, they're being babied, but you never were. Sounds like you raised \\*her\\* and she won't listen to you now. \n\nPlease do see a therapist of your own. If this is how your sister wants to live out her life, then that's her choice. YOU have to make choices for the one person you have control over -- yourself. You can't force your sister's actions, but you can manage and control your \\*reaction\\*. Work on that, get help with that. Distance yourself. \n\nFind your own peace with this. Make memories with her if you want. If she's too scared to get the surgery, then she may need a different therapist now. \n\nConvey your feelings, not what you want her to do -- you want to see her happy and having a fuller life, not to be limited by her health. Tell her that, don't focus on her actions, but how you feel. Maybe go to a joint counseling session so you can both safely express yourselves.", "This is a tough call. If you want to stage an intervention, you have to have your family on your side first. You need to get your mom to make your sister be independant instead of babied.", "Nah\n\nYou're allowed to be mad that she's taking up your mother's life as much as she is, and she's allowed to be scared of the risks of open heart surgeries. \n\nDon't scream at her though. You and your mother need to sit her down and calmly have a conversation where she is asked what her plan is if/when your mother passes, because she isn't your responsibility. Make it as clear as possible that she isn't your responsibility.", "NTA, but I think a healthier response is to simply put some distance. This obviously hurts you, but ultimately you cannot control how two other adults decide to live their lives. Your mother is enabling your sister and doing her NO favors for the reason you said - what will happen to your sister when mom is gone? Your sister\u2019s excuse that she\u2019s prioritizing her \u201cmental health\u201d is absurd, because playing video games all day is NOT how mental health prioritization works. Sounds like she\u2019s actually doing the opposite of prioritizing mental health.", "Nah. The fact is that it is your sister's body and health. If she doesn't want surgery then no one can or should force her. Your mom and sister are both content with how things are. They aren't going to change because you want them to. However nicely pointing out to your mother and sister that eventually your mother won't be able to do every thing for your sister is fair. Tell them you are concerned and tell them you suggest they develop a plan. Only if you are asked to become her caretaker do you point out that you won't do it. Just calmly say no and stick with it. If they don't ask - don't say anything about that.", "I don't think you WBTA, but I would tread carefully with comparing your experience to hers.  While the situation is similar, people deal with things differently.  I don't think pointing out to her that you were able to achieve things that she can't will be helpful.    \nI think talking to her about what would happen if your mother passes and telling her she won't be living with you is fine.  Saying that you were able to do these things while experiencing the same medical conditions won't.", "Yikes. Tough call. Do consider that even though your mom is doing everything for her, your mom may not have it any other way. Even though she\u2019s not well, I think your sister is being TA here.", "NTA - your sister is absolutely the one in the wrong here. However I\u2019m not so sure having it out with her is going to change anything. If she doesn\u2019t want to change nothing you say will make a difference so go in with realistic expectations", "NTA for your concern for your sister.\n\nYWBTA going in guns blazing as to her rescue. It's not YOUR place to handle it. Your Mom really needs to stop enabling and coddling her self destructive behavior \n\nAnd refusing to even fill out the disability forms when she's living on your mom's dime? That is definitely being a selfish AH.", "This is very difficult. She does seem to be setting herself up for a sad and unfulfilling life where at the same time she taking advantage of ur parents and expecting things to come to her instead of having to take them for herself (which if she survives she will have to do eventually). However, if the threat of dying is imminent, i would think she should be able to spend that little time left being selfish and self absorbed if that is what she pleases and if others (ur parents) are willing to accommodate that.\n\nIm a bit confused if ur asking if u would be the asshole if u told her to get her shit together or if u told her to get the life saving surgery. \n\nIf it is to get her shit together I would need to know more about the nature of the condition, specifically the life expectancy with it. And, from my perspective, this does sound immensely hard to go through, and u sound very strong in ur ability to persevere through the same thing. It doesnt sound like the craziest thing to me that she is going to the path she is given her circumstances. \n\nIf it is to tell her she should get the surgery you would not be the asshole if you did it in a way that she can tell ur doing it from a place of love and doesnt feel attacked. Maybe showing that u know what it is like, that u went through the exact same thing, and that like u said she may die with it, but she WILL die without it, and that u dont want to lose her, but understand her hesitancy", "If you want to start this conversation have it with your mom first. Ask her what she thinks the plan is. Then speak to your sister with your mom. If she doesn\u2019t want to get involved then back off. It\u2019s their problem, not yours. NTA", "NAH. I mean, you're not wrong and you make very, very good points about how this effects the wellbeing of both your mom and your sister, but ultimately you can't unstick her from whatever she's stuck in right now and you can't make her medical decisions for her. You don't have to be supportive, though. You can opt out, let her know that you're not going to be here for this and will not be supporting her, but that's really where what's fair for you to do ends.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Certainly, tell your sister she will not be ~~leaching off~~ living with you after Mom dies. In fact, tell all your siblings, too.\n\nYour mother is an adult; she has made her own choices. If you are concerned she feels trapped by your sister, discuss that with her.\n\nYour sister is an adult; all you can do is share the information you have and support choices you think are healthy. \n\nYou have to let this sense of responsibility go.", "NTA - i feel your mom is enabling your sister to be lazy and not care if she dies by allowing her to live off of her. Maybe some distance with your sister would be ok, she has made her choice to not care about her life. Don\u2019t stress yourself out over it, it\u2019s not your choice. Your sister is the AH and your mom an enabler. Let them deal with their mess. Focus on you and living your life, there is not much you can do.

It always amazes me how a person who experiences a situation expects a person in a parallel situation to react the EXACT same way. We don\u2019t get prizes for pushing through a situation, we gain experience. Your experience should be able to offer your sister some sympathy. I am glad you overcame your obstacle in a manner that made you proud. Now let your sister overcome hers with a little support from you.", "Is it even open heart surgery? When they finally figured out that my husband's 'panic attacks' were actually SVT (in his late 40s!) they were able to fix it in a minimally invasive cath lab procedure - outpatient. \n\nJust a guess based on the information here- sounds like she might be using her condition as an excuse not to make any effort at life, and Mom is enabling her mightily.\n\nIf you want to tell your sister that you won't be housing/supporting her in the future, that's fine. Be sure you explain that to your mom too. But beyond explaining what you will and won't do for her in the future, it isn't really your business. Peoples bad choices are still their own choices."]}
