You had cancer as a kid, they should've took you to a doctor when they noticed that you had trouble swallowing, even if there were no other issues before. And saying excuses isn't an apology, they should realize that they fucked up.\nAnd even is someone just doesn't like food to that extent that they can't eat, they should be taken to a doctor. I have an eating disorder that caused me to not be able to eat or throw up everything since I was a teen, and even I was taken to doctors to find out what's causing it.", "NTA\n\nYou were suffering your whole life and they just ignored it. They starved you, and now you're suffering from *heart failure* because of their abominable behavior. (And how could they not know. You're weight is so low!)\n\nYou are perfectly free to say you do not wish to have contact at this point in time.", "NTA - They starved you into heart failure?  And now feel bad (makes sense, they should), but while you should forgive them for your own peace of mind, you owe them nothing.  You don't even need to tell them you forgive them, just tell them you aren't ready for any relationship or contact.", "You said they \"won't admit what they did\" but you also said \"not wanting to hear my family's apology\" in the title.  Those don't seem to make sense together, can you elaborate?", "\u201cOf course you feel bad for what you did. You knew I had altered been through a lot medically but decided the approach of suck it up made so much more sense than actually seeing a doctor. I don\u2019t forgive you.

It's not fair. You do whatever it is that you need to do to keep yourself happy and safe. If that means ignoring them, do it. It's time for you to look after you.", "You cannot be pressured into forgiving. They can ask for it but shouldn't expect it. You have suffered due to their neglect and ignorance. You can work on your feelings in your own time but this isn't a movie where death suddenly makes all the bad that happened in the past go away (a very toxic trope imo). You are still on your way to recovery, so them almost demanding you put your valid feelings aside for their peace of mind is incredibly selfish and is probably not going to happen in the near future.Many people argue that letting go is the best thing you can do. This might sound petty, but some people deserve to be reminded of their mistakes. Actions have consequences. I'm sure they didn't mean you any harm, but their mistakes could have been fatal for you.", "NTA- them ignoring the problem could have killed you. You don't have to listen to any apology from them until you're ready to (even if you're never ready to, that is also your choice). They can go kick rocks and reflect on how their negligence almost caused your death.", " YTA. It seems like your family made some mistakes, but refusing to hear their apologies? Cold. They are showing remorse and reaching out to make amends, and you're outright rejecting them? Where\u2019s your sense of forgiveness?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Doctor said just tight tendons and gave her exercises, that didn't help, go back same thing, x ray after x ray, this went on for YEARS, finally she fell in athletics and her elbow froze in a bent position.  She was sent to a specialist, they didn't see what was wrong in another x-ray, finally a doctor saw it in a CT scan.  She had a tumor the size of a softball in her elbow.  It's removed now and after years of PT she can move her arm.  The oncologist who removed her tumor said he can see it in the first X-Ray she had when she was small.  What your grandma and Uncle did was inexcusable.  Going to a Dr should be a basic thing, even if the doctor said it's ok, keep going back to another because it clearly is not ok.", "Part of apologizing is taking responsibility for your part.

And from your perspective, in time it might be better for your own psyche to learn to let go of your anger and forgive them. (I was very angry when younger, and learning not to be was a turning point in my life.) So I don't want to say \"definitely don't forgive them they are evil.\"  \n\nBut... even if they are good people who made a mistake, you don't need to or have to forgive them.  Sometimes the things people do to us become part of who they are.  We can't separate the action from the person.  If that's where you are, then \"accepting\" their apology doesn't matter.  They'll still always be the people who did that to you, and you won't have a place for them in your life.", "Your a great parent an absolutely amazing parent", "Thank you for that, I don't feel like one sometimes, thank you."]}
