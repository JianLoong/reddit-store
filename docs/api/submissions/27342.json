It's time for you to look after you.", "You cannot be pressured into forgiving. They can ask for it but shouldn't expect it. You have suffered due to their neglect and ignorance. You can work on your feelings in your own time but this isn't a movie where death suddenly makes all the bad that happened in the past go away (a very toxic trope imo). You are still on your way to recovery, so them almost demanding you put your valid feelings aside for their peace of mind is incredibly selfish and is probably not going to happen in the near future.Many people argue that letting go is the best thing you can do. This might sound petty, but some people deserve to be reminded of their mistakes. Actions have consequences. I'm sure they didn't mean you any harm, but their mistakes could have been fatal for you.", "NTA- them ignoring the problem could have killed you. You don't have to listen to any apology from them until you're ready to (even if you're never ready to, that is also your choice). They can go kick rocks and reflect on how their negligence almost caused your death.", " YTA. It seems like your family made some mistakes, but refusing to hear their apologies? Cold.

It's removed now and after years of PT she can move her arm.  The oncologist who removed her tumor said he can see it in the first X-Ray she had when she was small.

So I don't want to say \"definitely don't forgive them they are evil.\"  \n\nBut... even if they are good people who made a mistake, you don't need to or have to forgive them.  Sometimes the things people do to us become part of who they are.  We can't separate the action from the person.  If that's where you are, then \"accepting\" their apology doesn't matter.

You owe then nothing and if you decide to accept their apology and forgive them, doesn\u2019t mean you have to have them in your life anymore, For now, you need to focus on your own health and if they kept pushing you, have your mom tell them to stop because you do not need the stress.
