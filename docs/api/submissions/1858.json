This was after 6 years of sleeping in different rooms and 2 years of having separate houses. My brothers and I always agreed to stay out of their relationship problems ever since we were young because we knew what was inevitably the outcome and we didn\u2019t want to choose sides. By the time they divorced we were all adults and either out of college or about to be. We became involved, however, after it was revealed that our father had cheated on our mother for the entirety of those 8 years. We had our suspicions since our mother constantly talked about a woman she didn\u2019t like from our father\u2019s work that he would constantly spend time with, but we never knew it was actually happening until our uncle (who worked with our father) told our whole family. Afterwards we rallied on our mother\u2019s side of the situation and agreed that we couldn\u2019t forgive our father for this.\n\nIt\u2019s been two years since the divorce and although I expected feelings to change, I didn\u2019t think they would end up as they are so quickly. About two months ago my mother started seeing a man that she\u2019s been getting serious with. Both of my brothers have met him but I have not. Despite this I think he\u2019s a great guy and he makes our mother happy, and my brothers share these feelings. Then, our father asked us if we would be comfortable with him bringing the his gf (the same woman he cheated on our mother with) to family gatherings and events. I asked my brothers what they thought, stating that I wasn\u2019t comfortable with it, and they both agreed that it may not be ideal, but that we should get to know her since we\u2019ve gotten to know our mother\u2019s bf.\n\nI understand where they\u2019re coming from considering that both of our parents have significant others now and me accepting one but not the other could be playing favorites, but I believe there are differentiating circumstances at play. While I agree our father should be happy, regardless of what I think about his character, I don\u2019t agree that his gf should receive the same treatment as our mother\u2019s bf, considering the fact that my mother didn\u2019t cheat on our father with said bf for 8 years. My brothers don\u2019t see it this way and instead have called me childish for not moving on.\n\nWhile I understand I may be seen as immature, I cannot see how my brothers think these significant others are on an equal playing field.", "created_utc": 1667971785, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yq9ocs/aita_for_accepting_my_mothers_boyfriend_but_not/", "score": 159, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your father did something deeply hurtful to your mom and anyone who expects her to be in the same room with the other person involved in that is being unfair. It doesn\u2019t matter if she\u2019s got a new boyfriend - it doesn\u2019t undo what sounds like years of hurt.", "NTA\n\nWhether you accept one of your parent's new SO's is dependent on who those SO's are and what effect they have had on your life.", "NTA you don\u2019t trust your dad\u2019s girlfriend because she\u2019s a home wrecker plain and simple. She doesn\u2019t get to walk into the family as if she did no harm or if she wasn\u2019t the cause of your parents getting a divorce. It\u2019s not a matter of moving on, it\u2019s a matter of surrounding your self with quality people and clearly they are not.", "NTA.  But.\n\nSomeone your mother became involved with after the marriage was effectively over is different than your father being involved with someone including during the marriage.  Not equal.\n\nThat said, the reality is that she is going to be in his life.  Are you prepared to effectively end your relationship with your dad?  It will be extraordinarily difficult to exclude his gf.", "What does your mother feel about all this?", "NTA.\n\nAs you say, welcoming your mother's bf is not the same as welcoming the woman your father cheated on your mother with. It's got nothing to do with being comfortable with your parent's dating again and being happy, and everything to do with who the person in question is and what they did.\n\nHowever, your father is free to date whoever he likes whether or not his chosen partner is accepted by his children. But taking this particular woman, his affair partner, to family gatherings is in very poor taste.", "NTA. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion.  It's not immature its being mindful that the gf knew he was married and carried on an affair.  Bringing her to family events may open those wounds again for your mother.", "Nta and good for you for sticking up for morals", "NTA. Now, if it were a different woman than the one he cheated with, then I would say YTA. It would be an awful and painful thing for your mom to have to see and possibly mingle with the \u201chome-wrecker\u201d per se, so she should not ever be present when your mother is and I think your father needs to firmly be told that. Now, if he gets a new girlfriend, then he should be allowed to bring her, as it doesn\u2019t quite represent part of a very painful past.", "NTA. Your father brining his gf to family functions would upset your mother especially as this is the woman your father cheated on her with for a large portion of their marriage.  Her boyfriend was never involved in the marriage. I don't see this as the same. You father should leave her behind until such time as your mother is comfortable with the situation.", "NTA\n\n>While I agree our father should be happy, regardless of what I think about his character, I don\u2019t agree that his gf should receive the same treatment as our mother\u2019s bf\n\nI would say that you should be as polite as you can muster and extend her basic respect but you certainly don't have to go out of your way to hang out with her. \n\nYour feelings are valid and these new partners are not equal; your dad and his partner disrespected you, your siblings, and your mother for years. Even if they try to make amends it might not undue the damage and they should be prepared for that.", "NTA. I understand your feelings. But you're not doing what you said you were going to do... Stay out of their relationship. Is this woman the sole reason for the divorce? They didnt sleep together for 6 years or even live together the last 2. Were they trying to work on the marriage during that time? There's a lot missing. Does your mom even Care?", "NTA, and\u2026\n\nI understand your resistance to making space for this woman in your life. You see her as a factor in hurting your mother, though your father was party to this. It may take some time for you to process through some of this and I recommend therapy. \n\nThat being said, people cheat for a reason. Sometimes that reason is because they\u2019re narcissistic AH, but sometimes there is something missing in their primary relationship and their needs are not being met. Have you spoken with both of your parents about this? Have you had an honest conversation with your father about why he cheated and if he understands the uncomfortable dynamic he is now forcing you and your siblings into?", "NTA. I'd like to suggest that you consider, though, that while your dad's cheating may have been going on for eight years, it is **new information for you** and **it is reasonable to allow yourself time to process the new information before making ackward decisions**.", "NTA, but how was the relationship between your parents? Not condoning cheating but if they had seperate bedrooms and later lived in different houses, it almost sounded like they were both checked out and divorced except officially for those 8 years. Were they still trying to fix their marriage, did they just stick together for you guys, what does your mom think about it?\n\nI mean if they weren't really having a relationship anymore those 8 years and just stayed together for parenting or whatever, maybe that changes the situation a little. Unless this affair was the reason they lived so seperately of course.", "NAH. Your brothers are ready to move on, you arent. I don't think this makes any of you an AH.\n\nStill, are you sure it was really cheating? If the gf has been with your dad from the time your parents essentially were just roommates (if separate rooms indicate that for them), it could be that they agreed to pursue their own relationships discreetly while waiting for you to be out of the house. Ask your mom what's what. Until you do, you may be just hurting yourself by clinging onto this.", "The past is the past. Your mom chose to stay in a bad relationship for six years before separating into a house of her own. Your dad must have been clear at that time that he wasn't going to give up his girlfriend. I suspect she stayed so that you guys could grow up in a two-parent household. Your dad has been with this woman for at least ten? years. She's a permanent part of his life. Keep the relationship with your dad alive and accept his partner. As for whether or not your mom and dad and their significant others should be in the same place at the same time would be something to run by your mom. If she can handle it, then go ahead. If not, then have separate time with dad and his GF. It's okay to forgive and move on.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's really not about favoritism. It's knowing that your father was involved with this woman while married to your mom. What kind of person does that? Your dad is obviously an asshole, but you're struggling with how to feel about his mistress. I'm a firm believer that spouses are responsible for cheating, but at the same time, as a child, even an adult child, you have to come to terms that she knowingly had relationship with a married man for years. Is that a person you can respect and like? And that's what you're struggling with. You feel you mother did it right. She waited until she was divorced before finding another man. Your father did not and you're wondering why he and his mistress should be rewarded for their crap behavior when they broke all the rules. You're wondering where are their consequences? Or at least that's my opinion.", "Right, like if you decide to be the woman who cheats with the dad\u2026 then lo and behold\u2026 you have to accept the hurt you caused this family. NTA\u2026 you have a right to feel and process without judgement. Same as your siblings", "NTA - I don\u2019t think it\u2019s immature. You\u2019re allowed to play favorites when one of the partners has done something to hurt one of your parents. Your brothers and dad are hard on you because it\u2019s inconvenient for them if you have boundaries with this woman. But honestly, this is the price your dad has to pay for cheating on your mom.", "NTA! Your father cheated on your mom and betrayed his family with this woman. She knew he was married and actively participated in the breakup of a marriage. Your mom\u2019s boyfriend had no part in their breakup. Not the same at all. \n\nYour dad\u2019s girlfriend has proven repeatedly over YEARS that she had no respect for your mom or your family unit. She is not to be trusted nor does she have Anyone\u2019s best interest at heart except her own. Huge difference!! \n\nYour dad is the major AH here. Major! Accepting his and his partner\u2019s betrayal, lies, subterfuge, and dishonorable behavior just because you\u2019ve embraced your mom\u2019s boyfriend is illogical. \n\nConsequences", "NTA I\u2019d go one step further and not invite your father to the family event as well.", "You don't know the whole story.  You don't now what arrangements they may have had.  They were separated for years and sleeping in different rooms.  That doesn't sound like someone who was sneaking around.\n\nYou don't get to decide who your father brings to a family event.  This isn't a hill worth dying on, just because someone comes to an event doesn't mean you have to like them, but your father is allowed to bring someone who makes him happy.", "NTA. Its hard to embrace someone you don't like and can't respect.", "NTA in the slightest, not even immature. Even if this person wasn't your father's affair partner and was someone completely new, it would still be your prerogative whether or not you wanted them to be involved in your life. Just like it was your father's pejorative to cheat on your mother for 8 years. Actions have consequences, and some can last forever. That's just the way of the world.", "NTA. You are reasons to feel the way you feel.", "NAH (except your dad) you have the right to feel the way you do and they have the right to feel the way they do. You make a good point about your mother never having cheated but maybe your brothers feel that after two years they want to move on from this and rebuild a relationship with your dad and his gf. You are free not to, but you would be TA if you stopped them from trying", "Exactly. His dad is trying to bring a woman around who knowingly helped him betray OP's mother, while expecting everyone to be cool with it. How tf does the dad not see how shitty that is? Oh, that's right, he's a selfish AH. NTA, OP.", "But she wasn't the cause. Their dad was. He could've said no, its not like she forced him. Imo if they accept the dad, they should accept her too. Or, if I would be in this situation, none of them. But acting like she is the sole moral problem is ridiculous", ">people cheat for a reason\n\nHuh?\n\n>sometimes there is something missing in their primary relationship and their needs are not being met\n\nI have a great advice for this kind of situation!\n\nEnd the relationship you are not happy with and then find a new partner! There is nothing that can excuse cheating. It unnecessary hurts your actual partner.", "They both were the cause, and since OP doesn\u2019t want to go NC because dad is still family for better or for worse, but doesn\u2019t want to welcome dad\u2019s girlfriend with open arms, he doesn\u2019t have to. \nPeople are way to forgiving on infidelity nowadays, she went on \u201ca mission\u201d to steal the husband from a family and she held on tight (8years) until she finally succeeded. Dad is not much better either but if it took him 8 to finally get a divorce might be because he wasn\u2019t that willing to let go of his marriage. So when you say she didn\u2019t \u201cforce\u201d him I might agree with you there but for sure she manipulated him to stay with her too. People have to own the responsibility for their mistakes and if the dad is lucky enough to not get a NC card from the kids (even though they disapprove of his ways) the girlfriend shouldn\u2019t have a \u201cfree ride\u201d into the family\u2019s life. Makes sense? She made the bed she literally has to sleep in it.\n\nEdit: typo", "Thank you for writing this comment. The dad cheated.

The dad and AP have been together for 8 years, they did a crappy thing but at this point the dad and AP are a package deal.", "Very magnanimous of you", "You have a right to be upset. Unlike the rest here, I'll give you a pass on not willing to accept your dad's AP. People on the comments are viewing you through the lense of a wronged partner. However, you arent the partner cheated on, you are the child caught in between.\n\nYour reasons for not wanting to meet her are different from your mom's reasons. AP played a role in your parent's divorce.\n\nYou're not wanting to meet AP maybe because it led to your parent's divorce, which ultimately affected your relationship with dad, and how you view him. He left mom, and by extension, you, and you're probably still processing this.", "Not the asshole. It doesn't sound like your dad is making any effort whatsoever to make you comfortable. So it's unreasonable to put that responsibility on yourself.", "Have you ever asked your father why he cheated? even though it might not be a \"fun\" conversation - you might not have the full story of what went on in your parents relationship leading up to the divorce", "Nta, why would anyone treat their father's ap similarly to a man their mother dated after a divorce?", "NTA", "NTA.

They slept separately the entire time. Most likely it was a financial decision to stay together. Possibly joint assets, possibly they were concerned about custody and/ or child support. They were separated in all but name, then finalised it when the kids were grown and self sufficient.\n\nThis isn't an evil homewrecker trying to pry Dad away from his loving family while he valiantly fights her off but occasionally falls on top of her naked.", "I get your point, but I disagree. OP already had a relationship with the dad. To continue the relationship is not the same as starting a relationship with the AP. \nI guess it is up to dad and AP to either accept this or not.", "If you know someone is married, and you help them cheat then you are not a good person. Yeah, the dads TA, but so is the home wrecker.", "Except he has an established relationship with his father. People can dislike what their parents do without being entirely willing to cut them off and still want nothing to do with their side piece.

I don't think OP would be the asshole if he cut out both Dad and affair partner.", "Relationships are rarely that black and white. My mother cheated and people think that automatically makes her the bad person. There was 15 years of backstory before she got to that point. A home wrecker is someone who sets out to destroy a persons home. An affair partner of 8 years is more than that. The parents took steps to protect the kids as much as possible but there is no way of knowing what happened before the affair started.", "No one is saying it\u2019s not a big deal.
