This was after 6 years of sleeping in different rooms and 2 years of having separate houses. My brothers and I always agreed to stay out of their relationship problems ever since we were young because we knew what was inevitably the outcome and we didn\u2019t want to choose sides. By the time they divorced we were all adults and either out of college or about to be. We became involved, however, after it was revealed that our father had cheated on our mother for the entirety of those 8 years. We had our suspicions since our mother constantly talked about a woman she didn\u2019t like from our father\u2019s work that he would constantly spend time with, but we never knew it was actually happening until our uncle (who worked with our father) told our whole family. Afterwards we rallied on our mother\u2019s side of the situation and agreed that we couldn\u2019t forgive our father for this.\n\nIt\u2019s been two years since the divorce and although I expected feelings to change, I didn\u2019t think they would end up as they are so quickly. About two months ago my mother started seeing a man that she\u2019s been getting serious with. Both of my brothers have met him but I have not. Despite this I think he\u2019s a great guy and he makes our mother happy, and my brothers share these feelings. Then, our father asked us if we would be comfortable with him bringing the his gf (the same woman he cheated on our mother with) to family gatherings and events. I asked my brothers what they thought, stating that I wasn\u2019t comfortable with it, and they both agreed that it may not be ideal, but that we should get to know her since we\u2019ve gotten to know our mother\u2019s bf.\n\nI understand where they\u2019re coming from considering that both of our parents have significant others now and me accepting one but not the other could be playing favorites, but I believe there are differentiating circumstances at play. While I agree our father should be happy, regardless of what I think about his character, I don\u2019t agree that his gf should receive the same treatment as our mother\u2019s bf, considering the fact that my mother didn\u2019t cheat on our father with said bf for 8 years. My brothers don\u2019t see it this way and instead have called me childish for not moving on.\n\nWhile I understand I may be seen as immature, I cannot see how my brothers think these significant others are on an equal playing field.", "created_utc": 1667971785, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yq9ocs/aita_for_accepting_my_mothers_boyfriend_but_not/", "score": 693, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She doesn\u2019t get to walk into the family as if she did no harm or if she wasn\u2019t the cause of your parents getting a divorce. It\u2019s not a matter of moving on, it\u2019s a matter of surrounding your self with quality people and clearly they are not.", "NTA.  But.\n\nSomeone your mother became involved with after the marriage was effectively over is different than your father being involved with someone including during the marriage.  Not equal.\n\nThat said, the reality is that she is going to be in his life.  Are you prepared to effectively end your relationship with your dad?  It will be extraordinarily difficult to exclude his gf.", "What does your mother feel about all this?", "NTA.\n\nAs you say, welcoming your mother's bf is not the same as welcoming the woman your father cheated on your mother with. It's got nothing to do with being comfortable with your parent's dating again and being happy, and everything to do with who the person in question is and what they did.\n\nHowever, your father is free to date whoever he likes whether or not his chosen partner is accepted by his children. But taking this particular woman, his affair partner, to family gatherings is in very poor taste.", "NTA. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion.  It's not immature its being mindful that the gf knew he was married and carried on an affair.  Bringing her to family events may open those wounds again for your mother.", "Nta and good for you for sticking up for morals", "NTA. Now, if it were a different woman than the one he cheated with, then I would say YTA. It would be an awful and painful thing for your mom to have to see and possibly mingle with the \u201chome-wrecker\u201d per se, so she should not ever be present when your mother is and I think your father needs to firmly be told that. Now, if he gets a new girlfriend, then he should be allowed to bring her, as it doesn\u2019t quite represent part of a very painful past.", "NTA. Your father brining his gf to family functions would upset your mother especially as this is the woman your father cheated on her with for a large portion of their marriage.  Her boyfriend was never involved in the marriage. I don't see this as the same. You father should leave her behind until such time as your mother is comfortable with the situation.", "NTA\n\n>While I agree our father should be happy, regardless of what I think about his character, I don\u2019t agree that his gf should receive the same treatment as our mother\u2019s bf\n\nI would say that you should be as polite as you can muster and extend her basic respect but you certainly don't have to go out of your way to hang out with her. \n\nYour feelings are valid and these new partners are not equal; your dad and his partner disrespected you, your siblings, and your mother for years. Even if they try to make amends it might not undue the damage and they should be prepared for that.", "NTA. I understand your feelings. But you're not doing what you said you were going to do... Stay out of their relationship. Is this woman the sole reason for the divorce? They didnt sleep together for 6 years or even live together the last 2.

Does your mom even Care?", "NTA, and\u2026\n\nI understand your resistance to making space for this woman in your life. You see her as a factor in hurting your mother, though your father was party to this. It may take some time for you to process through some of this and I recommend therapy. \n\nThat being said, people cheat for a reason. Sometimes that reason is because they\u2019re narcissistic AH, but sometimes there is something missing in their primary relationship and their needs are not being met. Have you spoken with both of your parents about this? Have you had an honest conversation with your father about why he cheated and if he understands the uncomfortable dynamic he is now forcing you and your siblings into?", "NTA. I'd like to suggest that you consider, though, that while your dad's cheating may have been going on for eight years, it is **new information for you** and **it is reasonable to allow yourself time to process the new information before making ackward decisions**.", "NTA, but how was the relationship between your parents? Not condoning cheating but if they had seperate bedrooms and later lived in different houses, it almost sounded like they were both checked out and divorced except officially for those 8 years. Were they still trying to fix their marriage, did they just stick together for you guys, what does your mom think about it?\n\nI mean if they weren't really having a relationship anymore those 8 years and just stayed together for parenting or whatever, maybe that changes the situation a little. Unless this affair was the reason they lived so seperately of course.", "NAH. Your brothers are ready to move on, you arent. I don't think this makes any of you an AH.\n\nStill, are you sure it was really cheating? If the gf has been with your dad from the time your parents essentially were just roommates (if separate rooms indicate that for them), it could be that they agreed to pursue their own relationships discreetly while waiting for you to be out of the house. Ask your mom what's what. Until you do, you may be just hurting yourself by clinging onto this.", "The past is the past. Your mom chose to stay in a bad relationship for six years before separating into a house of her own. Your dad must have been clear at that time that he wasn't going to give up his girlfriend. I suspect she stayed so that you guys could grow up in a two-parent household. Your dad has been with this woman for at least ten? years. She's a permanent part of his life. Keep the relationship with your dad alive and accept his partner. As for whether or not your mom and dad and their significant others should be in the same place at the same time would be something to run by your mom. If she can handle it, then go ahead. If not, then have separate time with dad and his GF. It's okay to forgive and move on.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's really not about favoritism. It's knowing that your father was involved with this woman while married to your mom. What kind of person does that? Your dad is obviously an asshole, but you're struggling with how to feel about his mistress. I'm a firm believer that spouses are responsible for cheating, but at the same time, as a child, even an adult child, you have to come to terms that she knowingly had relationship with a married man for years. Is that a person you can respect and like? And that's what you're struggling with. You feel you mother did it right. She waited until she was divorced before finding another man. Your father did not and you're wondering why he and his mistress should be rewarded for their crap behavior when they broke all the rules. You're wondering where are their consequences? Or at least that's my opinion.", "Right, like if you decide to be the woman who cheats with the dad\u2026 then lo and behold\u2026 you have to accept the hurt you caused this family. NTA\u2026 you have a right to feel and process without judgement. Same as your siblings", "NTA - I don\u2019t think it\u2019s immature. You\u2019re allowed to play favorites when one of the partners has done something to hurt one of your parents. Your brothers and dad are hard on you because it\u2019s inconvenient for them if you have boundaries with this woman. But honestly, this is the price your dad has to pay for cheating on your mom.", "NTA! Your father cheated on your mom and betrayed his family with this woman.

Not the same at all. \n\nYour dad\u2019s girlfriend has proven repeatedly over YEARS that she had no respect for your mom or your family unit.

Even if this person wasn't your father's affair partner and was someone completely new, it would still be your prerogative whether or not you wanted them to be involved in your life.

Dad is not much better either but if it took him 8 to finally get a divorce might be because he wasn\u2019t that willing to let go of his marriage. So when you say she didn\u2019t \u201cforce\u201d him I might agree with you there but for sure she manipulated him to stay with her too. People have to own the responsibility for their mistakes and if the dad is lucky enough to not get a NC card from the kids (even though they disapprove of his ways) the girlfriend shouldn\u2019t have a \u201cfree ride\u201d into the family\u2019s life.

Unlike the rest here, I'll give you a pass on not willing to accept your dad's AP. People on the comments are viewing you through the lense of a wronged partner. However, you arent the partner cheated on, you are the child caught in between.\n\nYour reasons for not wanting to meet her are different from your mom's reasons. AP played a role in your parent's divorce.\n\nYou're not wanting to meet AP maybe because it led to your parent's divorce, which ultimately affected your relationship with dad, and how you view him. He left mom, and by extension, you, and you're probably still processing this.", "Not the asshole. It doesn't sound like your dad is making any effort whatsoever to make you comfortable. So it's unreasonable to put that responsibility on yourself.", "Have you ever asked your father why he cheated? even though it might not be a \"fun\" conversation - you might not have the full story of what went on in your parents relationship leading up to the divorce", "Nta, why would anyone treat their father's ap similarly to a man their mother dated after a divorce?", "NTA", "NTA.

They slept separately the entire time. Most likely it was a financial decision to stay together. Possibly joint assets, possibly they were concerned about custody and/ or child support. They were separated in all but name, then finalised it when the kids were grown and self sufficient.\n\nThis isn't an evil homewrecker trying to pry Dad away from his loving family while he valiantly fights her off but occasionally falls on top of her naked.", "I get your point, but I disagree. OP already had a relationship with the dad. To continue the relationship is not the same as starting a relationship with the AP. \nI guess it is up to dad and AP to either accept this or not.", "If you know someone is married, and you help them cheat then you are not a good person. Yeah, the dads TA, but so is the home wrecker.", "Except he has an established relationship with his father.

They don't come to family events, we have our visits but they're separate from family affairs because it'd hurt my grandma.

I stayed in the same house as my now ex for a couple of years after deciding to part ways and that was for the kids. We also agreed to discreetly pursue other relationships during that time so it is feasible that could have been an arrangement with your parents.", "This is semantics - she wasn't the sole cause, but she was a cause. Unless the affair partner has no knowledge of the affair, they also are partially to blame.", "Yes but did the affair happen after they didn\u2019t sleep in the same room anymore or did they sleep in a different room because of the affair", "Not really.  OP said the affair was going on during the time that they were having problems. If they were already at the point that they were sleeping separately when the affair started (given OPs timeline) then it sounds like they would be getting divorced whether or not GF was in the picture, and parents were only together \"for the kids\"", "I'm wondering that too. According to the OP, mom was upset about dad spending so much time with that woman, but it could be a \"the relationship was on the rocks but not over\", \"we decided to not officially end things and didn't discuss how that would look properly\", or just plain jealousy if they did end it. Maybe he had an affair and that's when the distance started. We don't know, and neither does OP. \n\nThey had separate homes two years prior to divorce, that sounds pretty definite as well. It started 10 years ago, when the youngest kids were 14, and separate housing was at 20. They massively dropped the ball on explaining things to the kids. I personally think there's just not enough INFO to go on because of that\n\nEditing to add: divorce is incredibly expensive and lots of places have weird laws for it. Some places require a certain period of separation before a couple can seek divorce, or require counseling, etc. I feel like the three kids need to sit down and talk with their parents about the timing of events and everyone discusses their feelings. The other brothers willing to be around the GF, OP not feeling the same, figure out the timeline, and figure out why they didn't tell *anyone* this, even after everyone was an adult.

He cheated, he was in a relationship and he destroyed it. But we aren't in the situation. Its probably easier to cope if you don't see it this way", "Considering the timeline, I think they're...related? Like maybe the mom suspected or learned about the affair and was biding her time as she built up enough resources to leave? Or the dad was so into this woman that he was noticeably pulling away from his wife further and further until they ended up with a divorce. It's possible that a internal fight went with him thinking, \"fuck it\" and deciding to cheat soon after. \n\nLike I said, related, if not the root cause of it.", "Sure but it's small potatoes compared to being a married person and having an affair. \n\nThat's infinitely worse imo.", "Lmao the downvotes. I can only assume this means, being married and cheating is better than being single and fucking around", "INFO: I think there\u2019s too much you don\u2019t know.\n\nIt sounds like the cheating started at the same time they started sleeping in separate beds. So, which caused which?\n\nThe past 8 years of their life screams \u201cstay together for the kids\u201d. It\u2019s hard for me to judge either of your parents when they may well have decided to be split then, or they may have decided to try harder for their marriage and failed.\n\nRegardless, if your dads been with her for 8 years, she ain\u2019t going away soon, so if you want a relationship with him you need to think about it", "NTA An affair partner isn't an innocent person someone met after a divorce.

That is a marriage in name only. How long do you have to have a sexless marriage before it gets to the point you say fuck it and sleep in separate rooms?

Again not excusing it, but I definitely would be more forgiving if they split rooms and houses, stayed together for kids and the affair happened than if the affair happened, they split rooms and houses and didn't divorce for the kids. So that is why I asked. It's NTA either way because even with the best case scenario it is still not great and he doesn't need to forgive anyone. Cheaters always think that it has nothing to do with their children but cheating hurts the whole family and can be traumatic for kids. Then he just had to divorce his wife before sticking it into company ink.", "Dude I dont give af if this husband is an Holy man. I just responded to a comment which was about the gf.

It sounds like the parents basically separated 8 years ago (sleeping in separate rooms), but continued to live in the same home, probably for the sake of the kids. I wonder if an affair led to this separation, or if the dad got with this woman after they moved to separate rooms. \n\nI'm not giving him a pass, but sometimes context matters. They both may have agreed that the marriage was over but still wanted to present publicly as a couple.", "This is exactly the point. She's going to be in dad's life.

Not saying the father didn't go about it the wrong way but the context of the relationship at that point is important. If all children knew the inevitable outcome at a younger age then the marriage was never a \"loving marriage\". \n\nHonestly at that point I wouldn't call it cheating really, neither party was happy in the marriage and most likely lived together for the kids. He should've asked for divorce first before seeing someone else yes, but we do not know the information that led into the \"affair\".", "This exactly.\n\nWere they separated but co habitating during those years.....

They \"seperated\" 10 years ago, dad's relationship is 8 years old. That's not cheating imo. Dad AND mom should have been honest with their kids though, 14 is old enough to understand.", "I don\u2019t see anywhere where OP has forgiven her dad. They still have a relationship because it is their parent. They don\u2019t want a relationship with AP because there is no history there.
