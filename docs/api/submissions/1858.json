{"id": 1858, "submission_id": "yq9ocs", "title": "AITA for accepting my mother\u2019s boyfriend but not my father\u2019s girlfriend?", "selftext": "I (24M) have recently got into an argument with my brother (26M) and my twin (24M) about our father bringing his current gf to family events, outings, etc.\n\nTo preface, my parents got divorced about almost two years ago. This was after 6 years of sleeping in different rooms and 2 years of having separate houses. My brothers and I always agreed to stay out of their relationship problems ever since we were young because we knew what was inevitably the outcome and we didn\u2019t want to choose sides. By the time they divorced we were all adults and either out of college or about to be. We became involved, however, after it was revealed that our father had cheated on our mother for the entirety of those 8 years. We had our suspicions since our mother constantly talked about a woman she didn\u2019t like from our father\u2019s work that he would constantly spend time with, but we never knew it was actually happening until our uncle (who worked with our father) told our whole family. Afterwards we rallied on our mother\u2019s side of the situation and agreed that we couldn\u2019t forgive our father for this.\n\nIt\u2019s been two years since the divorce and although I expected feelings to change, I didn\u2019t think they would end up as they are so quickly. About two months ago my mother started seeing a man that she\u2019s been getting serious with. Both of my brothers have met him but I have not. Despite this I think he\u2019s a great guy and he makes our mother happy, and my brothers share these feelings. Then, our father asked us if we would be comfortable with him bringing the his gf (the same woman he cheated on our mother with) to family gatherings and events. I asked my brothers what they thought, stating that I wasn\u2019t comfortable with it, and they both agreed that it may not be ideal, but that we should get to know her since we\u2019ve gotten to know our mother\u2019s bf.\n\nI understand where they\u2019re coming from considering that both of our parents have significant others now and me accepting one but not the other could be playing favorites, but I believe there are differentiating circumstances at play. While I agree our father should be happy, regardless of what I think about his character, I don\u2019t agree that his gf should receive the same treatment as our mother\u2019s bf, considering the fact that my mother didn\u2019t cheat on our father with said bf for 8 years. My brothers don\u2019t see it this way and instead have called me childish for not moving on.\n\nWhile I understand I may be seen as immature, I cannot see how my brothers think these significant others are on an equal playing field.\n\nEdit: I\u2019ve been asked for the details of my parents separation. The reason my parents started sleeping in separate rooms in the first place was because my mother had seen a message from the woman on my father\u2019s phone. When she confronted him about it he told her that he hadn\u2019t felt attracted to her for a long time. That\u2019s when they started sleeping in different rooms. The reason they didn\u2019t start the divorce process was partly due to financial issues but mainly due to the fact that my mother was still in love with my father and wanted things to work out, despite the affair. They went to couples therapy and he promised her he would keep trying to make things work. However, he was still seeing this woman even whilst attending therapy. My mother told me and my brothers all this after they had started finalizing the divorce.\n\nAs for how my mother feels now: it was only a few days ago that my mother and father sat down to talk about possibly seeing each other\u2019s new partners, but she said she won\u2019t cause a scene trying to get her banned from family events for her kids\u2019 sake but that she doesn\u2019t ever want to meet her personally. They have both told me and my brothers it\u2019s up to us to decide how we feel about it.", "created_utc": 1667971785, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yq9ocs/aita_for_accepting_my_mothers_boyfriend_but_not/", "score": 1100, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s not a matter of moving on, it\u2019s a matter of surrounding your self with quality people and clearly they are not.", "NTA.  But.\n\nSomeone your mother became involved with after the marriage was effectively over is different than your father being involved with someone including during the marriage.  Not equal.\n\nThat said, the reality is that she is going to be in his life.  Are you prepared to effectively end your relationship with your dad?  It will be extraordinarily difficult to exclude his gf.", "What does your mother feel about all this?", "NTA.\n\nAs you say, welcoming your mother's bf is not the same as welcoming the woman your father cheated on your mother with. It's got nothing to do with being comfortable with your parent's dating again and being happy, and everything to do with who the person in question is and what they did.\n\nHowever, your father is free to date whoever he likes whether or not his chosen partner is accepted by his children. But taking this particular woman, his affair partner, to family gatherings is in very poor taste.", "NTA. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion.  It's not immature its being mindful that the gf knew he was married and carried on an affair.  Bringing her to family events may open those wounds again for your mother.", "Nta and good for you for sticking up for morals", "NTA. Now, if it were a different woman than the one he cheated with, then I would say YTA. It would be an awful and painful thing for your mom to have to see and possibly mingle with the \u201chome-wrecker\u201d per se, so she should not ever be present when your mother is and I think your father needs to firmly be told that. Now, if he gets a new girlfriend, then he should be allowed to bring her, as it doesn\u2019t quite represent part of a very painful past.", "NTA. Your father brining his gf to family functions would upset your mother especially as this is the woman your father cheated on her with for a large portion of their marriage.  Her boyfriend was never involved in the marriage. I don't see this as the same. You father should leave her behind until such time as your mother is comfortable with the situation.", "NTA\n\n>While I agree our father should be happy, regardless of what I think about his character, I don\u2019t agree that his gf should receive the same treatment as our mother\u2019s bf\n\nI would say that you should be as polite as you can muster and extend her basic respect but you certainly don't have to go out of your way to hang out with her. \n\nYour feelings are valid and these new partners are not equal; your dad and his partner disrespected you, your siblings, and your mother for years. Even if they try to make amends it might not undue the damage and they should be prepared for that.", "NTA. I understand your feelings. But you're not doing what you said you were going to do... Stay out of their relationship. Is this woman the sole reason for the divorce? They didnt sleep together for 6 years or even live together the last 2.

Does your mom even Care?", "NTA, and\u2026\n\nI understand your resistance to making space for this woman in your life. You see her as a factor in hurting your mother, though your father was party to this. It may take some time for you to process through some of this and I recommend therapy. \n\nThat being said, people cheat for a reason. Sometimes that reason is because they\u2019re narcissistic AH, but sometimes there is something missing in their primary relationship and their needs are not being met. Have you spoken with both of your parents about this? Have you had an honest conversation with your father about why he cheated and if he understands the uncomfortable dynamic he is now forcing you and your siblings into?", "NTA. I'd like to suggest that you consider, though, that while your dad's cheating may have been going on for eight years, it is **new information for you** and **it is reasonable to allow yourself time to process the new information before making ackward decisions**.", "NTA, but how was the relationship between your parents? Not condoning cheating but if they had seperate bedrooms and later lived in different houses, it almost sounded like they were both checked out and divorced except officially for those 8 years. Were they still trying to fix their marriage, did they just stick together for you guys, what does your mom think about it?\n\nI mean if they weren't really having a relationship anymore those 8 years and just stayed together for parenting or whatever, maybe that changes the situation a little. Unless this affair was the reason they lived so seperately of course.", "NAH. Your brothers are ready to move on, you arent. I don't think this makes any of you an AH.\n\nStill, are you sure it was really cheating? If the gf has been with your dad from the time your parents essentially were just roommates (if separate rooms indicate that for them), it could be that they agreed to pursue their own relationships discreetly while waiting for you to be out of the house. Ask your mom what's what. Until you do, you may be just hurting yourself by clinging onto this.", "The past is the past. Your mom chose to stay in a bad relationship for six years before separating into a house of her own. Your dad must have been clear at that time that he wasn't going to give up his girlfriend. I suspect she stayed so that you guys could grow up in a two-parent household. Your dad has been with this woman for at least ten? years. She's a permanent part of his life. Keep the relationship with your dad alive and accept his partner. As for whether or not your mom and dad and their significant others should be in the same place at the same time would be something to run by your mom. If she can handle it, then go ahead. If not, then have separate time with dad and his GF. It's okay to forgive and move on.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's really not about favoritism. It's knowing that your father was involved with this woman while married to your mom. What kind of person does that? Your dad is obviously an asshole, but you're struggling with how to feel about his mistress. I'm a firm believer that spouses are responsible for cheating, but at the same time, as a child, even an adult child, you have to come to terms that she knowingly had relationship with a married man for years. Is that a person you can respect and like? And that's what you're struggling with. You feel you mother did it right. She waited until she was divorced before finding another man. Your father did not and you're wondering why he and his mistress should be rewarded for their crap behavior when they broke all the rules. You're wondering where are their consequences? Or at least that's my opinion.", "Right, like if you decide to be the woman who cheats with the dad\u2026 then lo and behold\u2026 you have to accept the hurt you caused this family.

But honestly, this is the price your dad has to pay for cheating on your mom.", "NTA! Your father cheated on your mom and betrayed his family with this woman.

Dad is not much better either but if it took him 8 to finally get a divorce might be because he wasn\u2019t that willing to let go of his marriage. So when you say she didn\u2019t \u201cforce\u201d him I might agree with you there but for sure she manipulated him to stay with her too.

However, you arent the partner cheated on, you are the child caught in between.\n\nYour reasons for not wanting to meet her are different from your mom's reasons. AP played a role in your parent's divorce.\n\nYou're not wanting to meet AP maybe because it led to your parent's divorce, which ultimately affected your relationship with dad, and how you view him.

They slept separately the entire time. Most likely it was a financial decision to stay together. Possibly joint assets, possibly they were concerned about custody and/ or child support. They were separated in all but name, then finalised it when the kids were grown and self sufficient.\n\nThis isn't an evil homewrecker trying to pry Dad away from his loving family while he valiantly fights her off but occasionally falls on top of her naked.", "I get your point, but I disagree.

According to the OP, mom was upset about dad spending so much time with that woman, but it could be a \"the relationship was on the rocks but not over\", \"we decided to not officially end things and didn't discuss how that would look properly\", or just plain jealousy if they did end it. Maybe he had an affair and that's when the distance started. We don't know, and neither does OP. \n\nThey had separate homes two years prior to divorce, that sounds pretty definite as well. It started 10 years ago, when the youngest kids were 14, and separate housing was at 20. They massively dropped the ball on explaining things to the kids. I personally think there's just not enough INFO to go on because of that\n\nEditing to add: divorce is incredibly expensive and lots of places have weird laws for it. Some places require a certain period of separation before a couple can seek divorce, or require counseling, etc. I feel like the three kids need to sit down and talk with their parents about the timing of events and everyone discusses their feelings. The other brothers willing to be around the GF, OP not feeling the same, figure out the timeline, and figure out why they didn't tell *anyone* this, even after everyone was an adult. This goes beyond shielding the kids and not pulling them into their martial issues", "Its easier just saying the woman is the bad one then the own father. How people could be so blind idk. He cheated, he was in a relationship and he destroyed it. But we aren't in the situation. Its probably easier to cope if you don't see it this way", "Considering the timeline, I think they're...related? Like maybe the mom suspected or learned about the affair and was biding her time as she built up enough resources to leave? Or the dad was so into this woman that he was noticeably pulling away from his wife further and further until they ended up with a divorce. It's possible that a internal fight went with him thinking, \"fuck it\" and deciding to cheat soon after. \n\nLike I said, related, if not the root cause of it.", "Sure but it's small potatoes compared to being a married person and having an affair. \n\nThat's infinitely worse imo.", "Lmao the downvotes.

And in our culture, the social shame of a woman initiating a divorce because her husband was really, really, boring, just didn't seem like an option.\n\nI say this not to excuse OP's dad or make him change his mind about accepting the gf, but to say that we like to harangue cheaters here, but I feel like situations like this are pretty common AND it doesn't take that much mental gymnastics to look around and find others in a situation like this or to understand how someone could end up there and also not be a complete monster.", "I see what you\u2019re saying but your aunt was in a loveless marriage and everyone knew it therefore she sort of got a pass. OP\u2019s mother stayed because she LOVED the father and wanted to make the marriage work and she seemed to have believed her husband wanted the same. However it seemed that OP\u2019s father still cheated despite going to couples therapy and claiming to make the marriage work. With the same affair partner. Yikes.", "OP gave an update. they moved to separate bedrooms when OP's mom found out dad was cheating, but he promised to try to fix the marriage so they did couple's counseling. except he never stopped seeing the other woman. so the cheating happened first, then separation, then divorce. now dad wants everyone to play happy family with his gf.", "Yeah like I said, OPs dad doesn\u2019t get a pass. And the couples therapy is cringey but I can kinda sorta see someone going along with it to placate the other. Trust, when my aunt served the divorce papers, all of a sudden it was showing up (unexpectedly) to her job with flowers, coming up with exciting places to go on dates. I think he loved her, but his kind of love severely fell short of what she needed on a partner. Again not an excuse, just some things that give me pause", "NTA but your post is contradictory in a lot of ways. Yoi and yiur brothers didn't get involved in the parents relationship because you knew it would end like this, but now you are involved in their relationships with their respective SOs. In a sense you are playing favorites and the reasons you've given are understandable. That being said, if you agreed beforehand that it was none of your business then, then it really isn't now.  You clearly aren't ready to move on and you shouldn't be forced to, but if your relationship with your father is valuable to you, you might have a difficult decision down the road.", "NTA", " NTA. Dad suxxx", "NTA, but make no mistake - your Dad is one that's wrong here.  He's the one who married your Mom, he's the one who made a vow to her.  He's the one who decided to break that vow.  Now I'm not saying the GF is innocent, especially because she probably knew he was married, but..... *you don't know what he told her.*  She might have been lied to for nearly a decade, thinking their marriage was something entirely different than it was.  He's clearly capable of lying, a lot, to whoever he can to get his way.  So maybe don't blame the girlfriend AS MUCH as Dad.  Maybe give her a chance, but make sure Dad knows he's still wrong."]}
