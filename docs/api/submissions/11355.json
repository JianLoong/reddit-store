My skin isn't even that bad but she's the *only* person to point out every red spot on my face and tell me I have terrible hygiene and how I need to learn to clean my face (spoiler: I do clean my face I'm just going through puberty) \n\nI never had a problem with the way my skin looked until my mom chose to shit all over it", "Boiling with rage on your behalf. School is difficult enough.", "yeah, if OP wants to teach him to be comfortable with his own appearance and not feel shame for being different, they should support him in his decisions.  Let him know that they trust him to decide what's right for him.  There's nothing wrong with not wearing or wearing the eyepatch.  \n\nDon't undermine his confidence by telling him that he's wrong.", "There was a girl in my high school who had had open heart surgery. I don't know all the details but at some point she started wearing, well, normal tops, where her scar was sometimes visible. I don't know if she was self conscious about it, but she sure *acted* like she wasn't, and we all took our cue from her and it basically was a non-issue. In fact, I thought her confidence in the matter was super cool.\n\nTHAT said, I think being self-conscious about such a big change to your appearance is normal, and honestly an eye patch seems like a good way to deal with it. In any case it's really none of OP's business aside from accommodating her son (such as by helping him get said eyepatch and maybe getting him to therapy).", "I was thinking that there must be some cool characters with eyepatch's in his shows/movies/comics/books, that will make him feel cool about it", "For real! I knew a guy in grad school that wore one, he had all kinds of patterns and stuff. Everyone knew him because of that!", "My guess is that they feel like they failed as a parent that this has happened, and since an eye patch is both very noticeable and somewhat whimsical, and it feels like a slap in the face either whenever they see it on their child or when they see someone else notice it on them. \n\nIf this is genuinely what's happening I have sympathy, but this is not about them and they need to let their son wear it and work on their issues on their own.", "Her prosthetics are amazing! She recently helped a 5yo girl pick out her new eye and it was so stinkin cute.", "Was he also a surfer? I can't imagine \"shark attack\" being my go to assumption for an amputee lol but maybe now I've read this I will think that lol \ud83e\udd88\ud83e\udd23", "Get this man a monocle, he'll be the noblest of pirates jajajajaja op YTA", "I\u2019m a scuba diver and have some very \u201csharky\u201d looking scars on my arms from various surgeries. I inevitably have grown adults ask if the are shark bites! No, but that\u2019s a much better story than \u201cI\u2019m clumsy, fell down the stairs and had to have surgery\u201d", "Star Trek: Picard(season 2) was a thing--he could know what Borg are.", "I\u2019m nineteen and I know what borg is \n\nI mean to be fair I did get introduced to Star Trek by my dad but still", "My son is 17. He knows what the Borg are. Are you unaware that Star Trek is still a popular franchise? Which reminds me, we're behind on Picard in our house and need to catch up!", "I was wondering the same thing, but what I came up with for \"people assuming a shark attack\" was maybe they're Australian \ud83d\ude02", "I got. Bells palsy 15 yrs ago. I was given an eye patch by a Seafair pirate. Was awesome and really boosted my spirits for a time. I never recovered from the paralysis.", "Tell the people what they want to hear!!", "My kids have also long been assimilated into the Trekkie universe.", "yeah im doubtful it'll ever be enough to undo the brainwashing honestly. they banned ap black history in fl ffs.", "Same here - and it was hilariously disgusting! Adults take such things far too seriously.", "That's so funny !\n\nWhen I lived in Canada as a young woman, I used to go to an ice skating rink on a Saturday. One of the men working there had a glass eye. He would take it out and chase us round the rink, holding the eye out to us. We'd be screaming our heads off. So much fun ! :)", "Haha my best friend growing up was born without part of his eye and always had a glass one. They pranked a teacher who didn't know about it by getting fake blood and making it look like it had been stabbed. \n\nThey got that class back, though, by faking one of the pregnant students' water breaking. \n\nTo be clear this was planned and carried out as a class, teacher included. Thinking back maybe it wasn't the best learning environment lol.", "So kids with eye patches/glass eyes have some dope pranks. I'm loving the fact that a few of us have these cool memories of how cool, and confident those kids were to play these pranks/jokes."]}
