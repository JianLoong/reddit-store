How it reads the three months you gave was basically notifying them you were not renewing their lease.  Since you most likely only had a landlord/Tenant relationship and the lease was with your mom that passed.  I don\u2019t think you are wrong at all giving notice and starting early telling them they can\u2019t stay past it.  If they don\u2019t want to sign a new lease with the new rate then they need to go elsewhere NTA.", "These people have had a property at half cost for years.\n\nWhy the hell weren't they saving up to get ready to buy somewhere else together.\n\nOP can only subsidise them so long.\n\nNta.", "NTA. This was from your dad. They need to go if they can\u2019t afford the rent. You don\u2019t owe them anything.", "NTA, you were kind enough to give them 3 months to find a new place. You have no responsibility to these people.  Not your circus, not your monkeys", "NTA\n\nconsidering she didn't raise you at all and the step family are practically strangers you've already been more than generous with your halved rent. With such a discount on rent they should've been saving up to get themselves to a more stable living environment. You also didn't spring this on them out of the blue you gave them 3 months notice which is more than any other landlord would give. \n\nThis wouldn't even be an issue and no one would have anything to say if you hadn't even rented to her in the first place and rented to a stranger at full market value.", "In Washington state, you can only legally increase rent 10%. Hopefully you are not breaking any laws In your state with how this proceeded. \n\nNothing is worse than a spiteful family that wants to get you tangled in litigation.", "NTA\n\nPast generosity does not create future obligations.\n\nYou gave them six months warning that the discounted rent would be ending.", "NTA\n\nwere you close to your stepdad and step siblings and want to have any future contact with them?  If so, you may lose your relationship with them.\n\nBut regardless, it was your dad's house, he gave it to you.  You helped your mother & family by giving them significantly reduced rent for months.  You notified them in advance they would either need to start paying  the market rate or move out and that is fair.  They shouldve been saving money the whole time they were there.\n\nI get that losing your mom and her income is difficult for them but that is not your responsibility and if you wanted to give them more time to grieve that could be years.", "- Op has no relation with them\n- they had 3 month to find something\n- they probably leeched the mom for years which is why they don't want to find something nor pay real market rent\n\nEasy NTA", "NTA\nSaw in another comment that OP was not raised by their mum. Although that shouldn't mean much for the decision, it always means a lot. \nFrom the post, OP inherited the house. Rented it half price (!) to their mum and her family (and that was nice of OP considering the previous comment).\nMum passed away. 3 months later the family was given further 3 months to accept the new rent or find another place. And down the line they did not renew contract.\nAlthough the reason is because they can't afford it, that's not OP's problem. They're considered as strangers and regular tenants, people with whom they had no family-like contact.\nOP gave this people 6 months (!!) notice about increasing the rent. No other landlord would do that!\nDefo not the ashole. If anything, the family are entitled assholes wanting to feed on OPs charity. 6 months were enough time to try and get a different or another job; or save to pay for the increased rent for a few months or to get somewhere else.\nYou can feel sorry for them, but even if they had contact, OP doesn't have to lose money.

This isn't really a matter about AITA but how to secure your property safely.", "NTA. You've given them plenty of notice.", "I hope you don\u2019t end up with a squatters problem.

Morally I can see why it\u2019s an AH behavior.\n\nBut I feel like some information is needed. Based on your comments so far it doesn\u2019t seem like you were raised by your mother. Can you talk a little bit about that? What was your relationship like with your mother? Also, were you present for your half and Step siblings lives? You don\u2019t seem to care about them which in a lot of family dynamics blended especially it\u2019s not all that surprising, so if you could go a little bit more in depth about that.

I highly suggest you send them a letter via certified mail (better to get the letter notarized at your bank since it\u2019s typically free) & keep the original copy.\n\nThe only problem I see you\u2019re going to have is if the house is in good condition to rent out once they leave. Most likely there will be extensive damage to the property from years of living there & there\u2019s absolutely nothing you can really do because most likely you didn\u2019t do a move in inspection or regular inspections (my landlord does quarterly inspections). You can sue them for certain damages but if they have no money you\u2019ll be hard pressed to recoup anything. This is when you get your homeowner\u2019s insurance involved after you speak to an attorney.\n\nI also suggest you speak to an attorney to see what your rights are in regards to having the house inspected NOW. Most states allow landlords to inspect their properties with written notice (anywhere from 24 hours to 72 hours so check your laws). Document everything during that time from drains to cabinets to appliances. Things damaged like holes in the wall, stained flooring\u2026 it needs to be documented now so when they move you can compare things to see if they fixed things, made it worse, or left it as is. Again, speak to a real estate attorney who specializes in landlord-tenant laws.\n\nIn the future require tenants to have renters insurance & name you on it so that any future damages will be covered by it. \n\nJust be prepared for a fight in getting them out.\n\nNTA", "NTA \n\nAlthough a bit brutal to do to your half siblings (i'm assuming thats what you mean by her family), you don't have a familial relationship with them so I can see why you'd want to get full market value, you gave them 3 months notice to figure out how to afford this.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
