This might also be the case for him? Especially if he is maybe on the spectrum or has OCD symptoms.

It's mostly a sensory processing disorder and often comes with anxiety issues.\n\nMy kid was diagnosed with it. I have come to describe the difference between picky eaters and disordered eaters as follows:\n\nPicky eaters will generally eat whatever junk food you can name and avoid less healthy foods because they don't taste as good. Disordered eaters eat based on the foods that don't cause anxiety attacks. Offer my kid a bowl of spinach (we worked on getting him to eat this) or a mars bar and he will 100% choose the spinach.\n\nYour boyfriend's response is not rational because he is not thinking with his rational brain about food. It's all in his amygdala and food triggers his fight/flight response. That's just what the disorder does, he doesn't control that, but he can learn to manage it better with help. He likely experiences shame and fear of rejection because of his neurodivergent disability. The responses to this post are a good example of why most ARFID sufferers do. Him working through the fear of you breaking up with him now that his disability has caused tension is likely why its weird for you both right now.\n\nIf I were you, I'd show him some info on ARFID if he doesn't already know about it.
