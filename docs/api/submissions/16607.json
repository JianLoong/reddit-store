A bit of context is that he holds quite a bit of resentment towards us for the ways we\u2019ve parented him that he disagrees with, he\u2019s entitled to have his own opinion but he should be more charitable as what he sees as \u201ccontrolling\u201d or \u201ctoxic\u201d was what we thought was right for him and the best we could do, and if he can\u2019t see that instead being blinded by his fabricated reasons for such then that would be truly disappointing. My husband has to remind him that he considers me to be the \u201cmost devoted mother ever\u201d and oftentimes we bring in his older sister to talk some sense into him and be a conflict mediator, reminding him that he has no right to complain as she\u2019s seen bad parents and we are not like that. He claims her to be \u201ctoxic\u201d but he doesn\u2019t have any good arguments, instead resorting to name calling and saying childish stuff, so that\u2019s why he doesn\u2019t really have a leg to stand on.\n\nEarlier today I was bringing laundry into my son\u2019s room and found him reading a book titled \u201cadult children of emotionally immature parents\u201d which I obviously wasn\u2019t very happy with. He likes to think he is sooo abused, but I\u2019ve had it with his arrogance and told him that he can read all the books he wants, but to selectively listen to those who validate his worldview, he\u2019s much too smart for that. He then started to talk back, and that\u2019s when I brought in my husband and daughter, them saying how we\u2019ve done our best to follow the rules of a family therapist that he hired to try to tell us off (which the therapist didn\u2019t), and yet he hasn\u2019t held up his end of the bargain and proceeds to be arrogant and a blockhead with his habits, trying to argue against every one of our talking points instead of sitting down, listening, and admit fault, which my daughter said it was disgusting and makes her sick. That\u2019s when my son yelled at her at the top of his lungs, calling her a bitch and saying he regrets having her as his sister, to which she snapped back and said he just proved her point, that she doesn\u2019t care if he has high functioning autism, he knows that and isn\u2019t retarded, that if he continues this vomit inducing bullshit of his, don\u2019t come crying to us when he gets fired or jumped, and we left the room after that.\n\nLater that evening my son went back to the dorm and didn\u2019t tell us. We tried calling his phone but he didn\u2019t answer and had turned off location sharing. I texted him saying that if he doesn\u2019t respond then we would alert authorities, and he texted back saying that I \u201csomehow proved his point\u201d and he\u2019s soon going to go live with a friend so that he \u201cisn\u2019t beholden to me.\u201d I posted about the incident on our family Facebook, and he created an account to explain his side.

You may not agree with it, but he was trying to figure out what to do. You are not as perfect as you think.

Why would you need to publicly post about this? Your son may have a point - YTA.", "YTA All this post does is prove your son's side of the case. If this is you trying to paint yourself in a good light, you have failed miserably. If this is you trying to present an objective story, you have also failed miserably.", "YTA. It's pretty clear he's an adult child of emotionally immature parents.", "YTA.  You do sound immature.", "Y\u2019know, my dad got controlling and abusive when I was a tween, and stayed that way until I finished college.  My mom constantly called him out and tried to mitigate it.  We went to a family therapist, and the therapist clearly explained that my dad was controlling and his temper was inappropriate, but that there were some things he did do well (which was true - he was supportive and fairly generous when he wasn\u2019t being abusive, and the abuse was a relatively small proportion of our interactions, though it had an outsize effect because I couldn\u2019t even predict what would set him off).\n\nThe therapist told him that he was hurting me.  I know it.  My mom knows it.  But my dad walked out of that office believing that the therapist said that I was the problem and he was parenting well.  Neither my mom nor I could figure out how he could have so completely ignored the therapist validating the exact reason she and I insisted he needed to come to see the therapist, but I guess that\u2019s just part of the classic abuser mentality.  Abusers often refuse to acknowledge that their behavior is the problem, it\u2019s always that the victim is the real problem, and they wouldn\u2019t be driven to abusive behavior if the victim would just behave the way they were supposed to.  The thing is, the way the abuser wants the victim to behave is very controlling, so the victim can\u2019t behave like a normal person without being abused - they have to always perfectly predict and supply exactly what their abuser wants, or abuse happens.  My dad never laid a hand on me, the abuse was all verbal and emotional, but it still left deep scars.  I went away to college very young (at 16) to escape it.\n\nYou sound an awful lot like he did, during the bad years.\n\nYTA", "YTA The Facebook post proves it. His feelings are valid. You are overly defensive when he wants to be heard.", "Info: can you tell us why he thinks your toxic? It's hard to say if there's any assholes here at all because there's no context to why he thinks this way.", "YTA. \n\nSorry, but you messed up here. Your son is 19 and in college, he's an adult, and it's time for you to treat him like one. It's not fair to criticize him for reading a book about something that clearly affects him. And it's definitely not cool to bring in your husband and daughter to gang up on him and tell him that he has no right to complain about your parenting.\n\nI get it, you feel like you did your best and your son should be grateful for that. But the truth is, parenting is a two-way street. You can't just tell your son what to do and expect him to fall in line. He's allowed to have his own opinions and feelings, and it sounds like he's been trying to communicate with you about them but you haven't been listening.\n\nAlso, threatening to call the authorities just because your son turned off his location sharing and didn't answer his phone is way over the top. He's an adult, and he has the right to privacy and autonomy. If he doesn't want to share his location with you, that's his choice. Threatening to call the police just because you can't get in touch with him is a massive overreaction and could do more harm than good to your relationship with him. It's important to remember that your son is not a child anymore, and treating him like one will only push him further away from you.\n\nAnd then to post about the incident on Facebook? Come on, that's just adding fuel to the fire. Your son is clearly upset and you're not helping the situation by airing your dirty laundry on social media. You need to apologize to him and try to work through your issues together like adults.\n\nI'm not saying your son is blameless in all of this, but from what you've written, it seems like you're the one who's really causing the problem here. You need to take a step back and think about how your actions are affecting your relationship with your son.", "ESH. I was all on your side, until you publicly posted on Facebook for no reason.

You refuse to reflect on your own actions as a parent.\n\nJust because you did what you thought was right and the best you could and because you're a devoted mother doesn't mean you didn't hurt him. The best intentions can still screw a kid up. If you were just willing to acknowledge his perspective he could get better. His feelings are his feelings and dismissing them is cruel.\n\nYou gang up on him, air your dirty laundry on Facebook and threaten to call authorities if he doesn't let you stalk him.\n\nYou sound stubborn, toxic and childish and your son has AUTISM.

He claims her to be \u201ctoxic\u201d but he doesn\u2019t have any good arguments, instead resorting to name calling and saying childish stuff, so that\u2019s why he doesn\u2019t really have a leg to stand on.\n\nEarlier today I was bringing laundry into my son\u2019s room and found him reading a book titled \u201cadult children of emotionally immature parents\u201d which I obviously wasn\u2019t very happy with. He likes to think he is sooo abused, but I\u2019ve had it with his arrogance and told him that he can read all the books he wants, but to selectively listen to those who validate his worldview, he\u2019s much too smart for that. He then started to talk back, and that\u2019s when I brought in my husband and daughter, them saying how we\u2019ve done our best to follow the rules of a family therapist that he hired to try to tell us off (which the therapist didn\u2019t), and yet he hasn\u2019t held up his end of the bargain and proceeds to be arrogant and a blockhead with his habits, trying to argue against every one of our talking points instead of sitting down, listening, and admit fault, which my daughter said it was disgusting and makes her sick. That\u2019s when my son yelled at her at the top of his lungs, calling her a bitch and saying he regrets having her as his sister, to which she snapped back and said he just proved her point, that she doesn\u2019t care if he has high functioning autism, he knows that and isn\u2019t retarded, that if he continues this vomit inducing bullshit of his, don\u2019t come crying to us when he gets fired or jumped, and we left the room after that.\n\nLater that evening my son went back to the dorm and didn\u2019t tell us. We tried calling his phone but he didn\u2019t answer and had turned off location sharing. I texted him saying that if he doesn\u2019t respond then we would alert authorities, and he texted back saying that I \u201csomehow proved his point\u201d and he\u2019s soon going to go live with a friend so that he \u201cisn\u2019t beholden to me.\u201d I posted about the incident on our family Facebook, and he created an account to explain his side. It\u2019s driven a rift through our relatives and I have some supporting me and others chastising me,  one of them mentioned this site which I decided to post here.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
