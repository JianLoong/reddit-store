My bf thought it was the funniest thing he'd ever seen. He didn't know Mars was going to do this and was running into the room because he heard me yell.\n\nI have no training. I don't fight. I'm generally against violence. My former bf was, and is, very into martial arts and has won A LOT of trophies in various disciplines. My bf's take on this was: don't attack someone if you don't want to get in a fight.\n\nMy mom once attacked an actual home invader with a fireplace poker. She was a 45 year old housewife at the time. My 60+ year old father shoved a man off of a train (at the platform) because that man was harassing a hijabi. My 1.5m tall friend nearly stabbed a man in the groin with a knife because he grabbed her at a bar and pulled her into his lap. \n\nAttack a human, and they may fight back. Despite inventing civilization and laws, we ARE a predatory and violent species. \n\nThere's a lot of trite sayings that apply here: FAFO, \"if you don't start nothing, there won't be nothing,\" \"don't dish it out if you can't take it,\" \"don't start anything that you don't plan to finish\"...\n\nAs with all \"jokes\" that are only funny for the person making the \"joke,\" ask him to explain how it would have been funny. When he says some nonsense about the look on your face, ask him if it would have been funny for everyone or just for him. Let him know that you think it worked out to be very funny. \"Great joke, man!

Pretty much exactly like how it happened in Legally Blonde. \n\nI obviously didn't mean to hit him, and I had 0 military training. It was just a surprised reaction. \n\nSneaking up on people is just a dumb and dangerous prank that can easily result in injuries. \nEven unintentionally from an unarmed little girly in law class. \n\nThey wouldn't have said to you, \"why didn't you tell me she was an unassuming (IT and Business) Law student?\" \n\nThey were dumb.
