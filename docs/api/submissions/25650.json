It is entitled to come into someone\u2019s home and expect them to give them their belongings simply because they like them. I will remember this next time I\u2019m at your home and feel free to shop your belongings for anything that I like.\u201d", "NTA.  Your family seems pretty cavalier with your stuff.", "NTA. Tell your parents its rude to raise your children to be entitled.", "NTA and your sister is manipulative and should not teach her daughter to behave this way. She can go buy her one if it\u2019s that important.", "NTA. It's your stuff and quite rude of your niece to ask you for it and quite rude of your sister to try to guilt trip you into giving it to her. Your patents were over the top pressuring you.\n\nKeep the room locked when you have visitors. I just looked up this doll and saw a NIB for $218 to $500 for used. Send your sister and parents the link to these dolls and let them see what they were asking for.", "So, let's quickly look around on eBay to get an idea, searching for [\"Monster High Djinni Whisp\" and specifying sold](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_nkw=Monster+High+Djinni+Whisp&_sacat=0&LH_TitleDesc=0&rt=nc&LH_Sold=1&LH_Complete=1).\n\nLooks like easily $100, possibly more like $600 if you have a Kieran Valentine to go with.\n\nThat's clearly *not* simply a \"toy doll\" at this stage, it's a \"valuable collectible\".\n\nThe fact that some adults don't understand that other adults are entirely validly able to enjoy collecting what might seem like 'toys' is a them problem, not a you problem, OP.\n\nYou're NTA. Niece is a kid. Sister is an asshole for assuming that other people's expensive property is there to be gifted to her child.", "NTA. if your family wants her to have the doll , tell them buy it they damn self .", "NTA - I notice nowhere in your story that no one has offered to purchase the doll. Your parents and sister are adults and should know that money is what we exchange for goods and services. They are all being rude by asking you to gift something that belongs to you. They also need to teach your niece that we don't get everything that they want.", "NTA, the entitlement of your sister is just over the roof. And she is teaching her kid to be the same. \n\nThat's not a toy, that's an expensive collectable. No one can tell you you are too old to own smth, anything that you consider valuable\n\nI am petty, so I'd look up a similar doll and sens the link to all family members involved. Show them the PRICE of that dool and advice to purchase it for you niece coz she apparently needs it \ud83d\ude02", "NTA.\n\nThe rest of your family seems determined to turn your niece into a spoiled brat. No one is supposed to get everything they want handed to them on a silver platter. They can all pitch in and buy a doll of her own for the next big gift giving occasion, but she doesn\u2019t deserve yours just because she wants it.", "NTA: send her a link with the dolls price. Tell her to buy it from there.", "They\u2019re doing that kid a disservice not teaching her how to accept \u201cno\u201d graciously. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. Your sister should have taught her daughter that wanting something doesn't necessarily mean she gets it.\n\nProblem is, your sister would have a hard time teaching it when she has yet to learn it herself. Apparently, your parents have never learned this, either.\n\nDon't give in to this crazy entitlement. You are never obligated to give away anything of yours, not even one of your cheapest dolls.\n\nIf the niece's parents feel niece should have something, it's their responsibility to go out and buy it themselves.\n\nIf you feel generous, give them the information on how to purchase the doll they wanted.", "NTA. It's a rare collectible. Tell them the name of the doll, and they can buy her one.", "NTA\n\nWhat kind of lesson is that, that you just wander into people's houses and ask for random items that you want and expect to receive them? LOL, the nerve of some people.", "NTA. Kids don\u2019t get whatever they want & it isn\u2019t up to your sister or your parents. This is setting a boundary.", "NTA. If your family continues to pressure you, ask something from them that has sentimental value to THEM and see how they react. \n\nTell them where they can buy it or whatever. Don't reward bad behaviour.", "NTA. Your sister can't help herself to your things.", "NTA. \n\nIt\u2019s a very bad quality to teach your child that they can go into someone\u2019s home and \u201cshop\u201d other peoples belongings.\n\nKids get hurt, kids don\u2019t get everything they want, and that\u2019s OK. It\u2019s nice when you can surprise them with some thing that they want if they\u2019re behaving well but this whole situation reeks of entitlement and bad behavior on the part of your sister and parents.", "NTA. if your family wants her to have the doll , tell them buy it they damn self .", "NTA. But your sister and parents are all assholes. It's none of their business if you want to collect dolls, they are yours! And then to gang up on your over your decision. The nerve!", "NTA \n\nWhat is it with people these are your collection, sorry but no do not give it to her.", "NTA  \n\nCollectors do not give away their collections.   \n\nYour family is being ridiculous.", "Believe me your niece would discard that doll in a few days like it was nothing, you'll be visiting your sister's house and find your expensive doll outside in their lawn being dragged by their puppy and all your sister would say is, 'its not a big deal, it's just a doll'\ud83d\ude44 YTA keep your doll", "Nta at all", "Without reading NTA.\n\nFDK jk. It's your personal stuff you've bought with your own money nobody has a right to it.", "NTA and unfortunately I agree the entitlement seems to be manifesting in her daughter too.", "I find it hilarious that the sister thinks her child will remember the value of the doll and be forever grateful. It's not gonna be that much of a core memory.", "When did it become a thing to give children whatever they want just because they see it? If she's old enough to ask for the doll and try to wheedle her mom into getting it for her, she's old enough to have learned that some things just do not belong to her. NTA.\n\nI'd send the sister a link to the rare doll on the internet and let her go ahead and buy one for the niece herself--after she gets over the sticker shock."]}
