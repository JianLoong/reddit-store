Sister for pressuring you and trying to guilt trip you into giving her daughter your things and your parents because it sucks when people don't understand your passions and dismiss them as things for children. Lots of people collect dolls and feel special attachment to them, plus you spent tons of money on it. Like you told your sister, you'll find a doll that you're comfortable with giving your niece and that's more than enough.", "Oh HELL no.\n\nLife is filled with disappointments. Builds character.\n\nWhat would she say if you went over to their house and demanded the TV? Or their car? Or anything else. It would be a great bonding moment for you two, how could she possibly refuse?\n\nNTA.", "NTA.  You are not required to gift your possessions to a child and the child will get over it.  Honestly just start demanding your sisters prized possessions and and see how she likes it.", "NTA. The lesson your sister is teaching her child is deplorable.", "Nta  you said you make dolls make here one like it tell her you made it she will love it more  then the one she played with", "NTA, Get a lock for that door!", "Just stop. You have absolutely nothing to make up for. If they think that's logical and fair, then why don't you choose something of your sisters and walk around in her house or take her car because you know..you like it.. and you deserve it ..and just tell her that. Your whole family should be offering their collectibles up.. you know since it's the right thing to do, according to them, so where are their gifts to your niece? Does anybody else in your family have collections that you can just take items from,, because you deserve them?", "Is this a Reddit thing where grown ass people who don\u2019t get their way run to their parents or other family members to tattle and hopefully have them guilt that person?\n\nDo not give her your doll. OP you are a grown woman and your parents need to mind their own damn business.  If they or your sister thinks that your niece should this particular doll than they need to hunt it down and pay the premium price to get it for her.\n\nAlso don\u2019t let them shame you for your hobby.  \n\nLastly, going forward do not allow your niece into you doll room. Keep the door locked. No one has the right to free range in your home if it is going to cause drama.", "Your sister is the AH.", "NTA, your niece needs to learn shes not entitled to other people\u2019s belongings.", "Gaslighting at its finest here. Dolls at your old age. You're rude. Nah, fam. It's yours. Period. I'm old af and have collectibles. Just because *they* don't understand it doesn't mean you're in the wrong.\n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nThat's your collection, not some old toys you have lying around. I have nearly 200 piggy banks and a lot of old Shawnee pottery pigs, some in double, and about 50 teddy bears. I've been asked for a piece every once in a while, and my answer is always no. No guilt, no regrets.", "> It\u2019s a very bad quality to teach your child that they can go into someone\u2019s home and \u201cshop\u201d other peoples belongings.\n\nIt\u2019s bizarre that, in too many families, it seems to have become acceptable for children to demand other people\u2019s possessions. OP\u2019s sister should have had a talk with her daughter about how it\u2019s rude to ask for other people\u2019s things, not backed her up.", "Plus when someone sets the flying monkeys on me...it becomes a harder NO", "I particularly loved OP's parents' argument that it's rude not to give the kid something for which she asked politely. I mean, hell, if that's the rule, I'm going to find my friend or relative with the nicest, newest car, and go ask (*very* politely) if they'll give it to me \u2013 because saying no when I was so polite would be *terribly rude.*", "And send them the links for the $600 listings on Ebay", "Yeah, this is what I was missing from the story as well. The sister is incredibly pushy about this situation, including roping in parents. But all up to the point of actually buying the doll. Sister is all about creating memories for their child, except apparently when it costs her money.", "Agree, most kids won't appreciate a collectable and z the family definitely don't.  \nWhy is she the ta?", ">but\n\nIt's more than that. It's the \"but she asked nicely\" part of it. Like it you just ask nicely, people will give you whatever you want. That's a horrible thing to teach a child. So if someone ask's this little girl nicely to go help find their lost pet, she needs to go do it?", "This is the best idea.", "Yes, she asked nicely and was refused. But she wouldn't take no for an answer and brought in her mother.", "Monster high collector here!She can easily go up to 600 as she was a 2015 SDCC exclusive and in a 2 pack", "Absolutely. Always being \u201ca good girl\u201d got me into trouble as a child & adult. The word \u2018no\u2019 needs to be given & accepted early on."]}
