Sister needs to get a grip. Your hobby isn\u2019t more childish than any other collecting hobby and she needs to respect your belongings. Unrelated note: photograph and catalogue your collection and scan in or otherwise preserve (screenshots &etc.) any documentation you have from buying them, any appraisal, and add the collection to your renters/home insurance asap. And if you were to mention the total worth/replacement cost to your sister at some point it might make your point or she might be even more of a jerk about it, but you won\u2019t be left with nothing if a flood or fire or terrible niece was to destroy part or more of your collection.", "NTA but thr rest of the adults are", "You're sister is the asshole.

Idk what the commenter above is smoking, but you don't have to give up anything for anyone whether it costs $1000 or $1. I would suggest getting a lock for your doll room and not letting your neice or sister go in there ever again (if you even let them into your house again)", "Oh I'm 99% sure on that", "I mean I have a fair share of child hood toys that I still adore that isn't the issue (Although I admit kids don't keep everything they once loved I loved my barbie dream house. My mum sold it and I'm not torn up) but the issue her is the entitlement of the child and the parent", "Yeah, I was so pissed at my brother over the similar \"but she was nice about it so she deserves it\". \n\n\nHe said his cat swatted at my niece. No claws, but he didn't like it, bc \"she just wanted to play and she was being gentle\". So? He's an old man, just bc she was gentle doesn't obligate him to play with her. She's 1 and he can't speak. He told her, once again, no claws, in the only way he knew how to back off. It also sounded like it wasn't feeling well at the time. \n\n\n Thankfully, I told him he was being a jerk to his cat.", "If you want to keep those you will have to lock them somewhere but I don't know where if you live with your mom.", "I have my first doll - my mum keeped it for me, when I grown up and moved. Then I gave it to my daughter. Fond memories :).  \nMy daughter still has her first teddy bear. And she still sleeps with it, but only at home- she don't take it anywhere with her, because she is afraid that she can lose it. We have a project to build a shadow box/diorama  for it, when she'll decide it's time for \"retirement\" for it.", "I'm 68. I still have my 65yo cuddle bunny. I'd left it at my parents' house when I moved out, but my little sister refurbished it a few years later and gave it to me. <sniffle>  \nWhen I evac'd from a wildfire, it was on the short list with cats, computers, and my red Swingline stapler."]}
