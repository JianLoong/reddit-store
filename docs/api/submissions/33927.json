Now his sister is getting her first, and it's all she can talk about. \n\nI am insanely jealous and it's upsetting to hear about her excitement when I know I won't have it again. I've been politely leaving the room whenever the tattoo talk starts because I don't want to put a damper on her excitement and my fiance asked why. I explained to him that it's upsetting to hear, especially since the last fight was two days ago. \n\nHe says I'm overreacting, 'am I just going to leave the room forever' and that I'm being childish for bringing it up again.

The crapstorm started when the gf managed to get a compromise for getting a last \"small\" tattoo but when she came home she showed that she got a large tattoo in a very noticable area.

He says it to you not to share an opinion, but to be disrespectful and hurtful, about something you enjoy, as do literally millions of other people.

Now his sister is getting her first, and it's all she can talk about. \n\nI am insanely jealous and it's upsetting to hear about her excitement when I know I won't have it again. I've been politely leaving the room whenever the tattoo talk starts because I don't want to put a damper on her excitement and my fiance asked why. I explained to him that it's upsetting to hear, especially since the last fight was two days ago. \n\nHe says I'm overreacting, 'am I just going to leave the room forever' and that I'm being childish for bringing it up again.
