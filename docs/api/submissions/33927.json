Now his sister is getting her first, and it's all she can talk about. \n\nI am insanely jealous and it's upsetting to hear about her excitement when I know I won't have it again. I've been politely leaving the room whenever the tattoo talk starts because I don't want to put a damper on her excitement and my fiance asked why. I explained to him that it's upsetting to hear, especially since the last fight was two days ago. \n\nHe says I'm overreacting, 'am I just going to leave the room forever' and that I'm being childish for bringing it up again.

The crapstorm started when the gf managed to get a compromise for getting a last \"small\" tattoo but when she came home she showed that she got a large tattoo in a very noticable area.

He says it to you not to share an opinion, but to be disrespectful and hurtful, about something you enjoy, as do literally millions of other people.

Now his sister is getting her first, and it's all she can talk about. \n\nI am insanely jealous and it's upsetting to hear about her excitement when I know I won't have it again. I've been politely leaving the room whenever the tattoo talk starts because I don't want to put a damper on her excitement and my fiance asked why. I explained to him that it's upsetting to hear, especially since the last fight was two days ago. \n\nHe says I'm overreacting, 'am I just going to leave the room forever' and that I'm being childish for bringing it up again.

First of all, you already having two tattoos he doesn\u2019t like is not a \u201ccompromise.\u201d He has every right to not want to date a woman with tattoos if he really doesn\u2019t want to. But when he met you and realized you already had some and wanted more, his options were A. Decide not to date you, or B. Accept you as you are, a woman with tattoos who will probably get more. He does not get to pick and choose the parts of you that he does and doesn\u2019t like and start negotiations, especially when it comes to something like your appearance and self expression. You did not force him into the relationship and you don\u2019t owe him any favors because he *chose* to set aside a preference of his to be with you. \n\nWhat you\u2019ve described here isn\u2019t a healthy couple making a compromise.

He sees you so upset over something that\u2019s really important to you, that you gave up to make *him* happy even though you shouldn\u2019t have to, and his response is to call you childish.

You\u2019re not a used car for him to haggle over. Who you are is perfectly fine and worthy of love and you shouldn\u2019t have to \u201ccompromise\u201d on it.

It\u2019s about the way the two of you have handled this issue, which I\u2019d bet isn\u2019t too different from how you\u2019ve handled other issues. It\u2019s called codependency. I promise there are people out there who will love you without making you feel stupid for caring about things that are important to you.", "I'm guessing the 'compromise' is that they stayed together, and she didn't have to get laser surgery in order to keep the guy...   not a great compromise.", "How is it other people's problems to not engage in conversations that make you uncomfortable.

I regret waiting for him to dump me. Luckily, when I met my now husband, my tattoos were one of the first things he noticed and tone of the reasons he thought I was hot.
