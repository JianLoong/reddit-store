Keep the niece's rsvp. You committed to her first anyway. But also if your 'daughter' wants to mend the relationship, she needs to do it on regular days and not just on holidays. \nBut tbh, I doubt she really wants to mend or fix anything for the better. You may want to consider reducing support to her, she's an adult and she has other supports she can lean on that appears to be what she prefers anyway", "NTA. Fool me once... You've been fooled enough, it's time to go NC.", "Wait you're giving this girl money and she treats you this way?", "NTA.\n\nWhat you allow is what will continue. You deserve better.

It should require none of your effort.

Lots of young adults are flaky or thoughtless before they have a chance to grow up a bit but what you describe is abnormal. Taking pleasure from being deliberately cruel to a person who loves you and is therefore vulnerable to you is abnormal.  You don't owe it to May to make yourself vulnerable in order to see if she's grown past this behavior yet. People who display these traits seldom truly do. You deserve better from a daughter to whom you gave your best. I'm sorry.", "NTA. At this point it sounds like you\u2019re protecting yourself for good reason.

To the point where I'm confused why she was placed with you in the first place as it seems that family could've taken her in.\n\nThe fact she was even in the foster system usually means there's a big issue somewhere.  Does she have any diagnoses?\n\nRegardless, she's an adult.  Time to cut the apron strings to someone that only seems to want to hurt you.  It doesn't sound like she wants to be your daughter.  She just wants to humiliate you and perhaps like the financial support that you give her.  Perhaps it's time to walk away and let her biofamily pick up the slack.", "NTA.

You need to go no contact, put in the work toward that", "Big NTA. You seem like a good person. A few thoughts from my side:\n- May is a cruel person. She doesn't respect you. \n- Your hunch seems pretty reasonable about the invitation being a prank. \n- Even if she says that she wants to mend ways, because her only motivation seems either any money that she gets from you, or another mega humiliation plan in progress.\n- Anyway, I personally feel that she does not deserve a second chance.\n- Take care, OP!", "NTA: May is behaving like someone who only sees you as a means to an end for gifts and that's about it.

It's certainly been explained to her by others as well as by me.", "Of course. It's called reactive attachment disorder and it comes from prenatal drug exposure along with years of chaos, abuse and neglect from the bio-fam. This isn't something she did or deserved. It was something done to her by people who-- well, I could go on for hours but May has been let down by lots of lowlifes. She's had years of therapy but there's no cure for RAD except having a baby of one's own. Which she has done. She has greatly improved her conduct and sought out professional help, and this is why she is as positive as she is toward me. Also, she worships her kid and is a good mother because she struggles every day to be the kind of mom she needed as a child but didn't get. That's the kind of effort I like to support. It's worth standing in line for some formula or buying some diapers to keep an eye on the kid.\n\nRAD is pretty vicious and you never know when the person who has it is going to turn on you violently. The hatred and sabotage is directed entirely toward the caregivers and authority figures. For a more detailed example of how a person with RAD behaves, watch \"We need to talk about Kevin\" but imagine a single parent who doesn't go through the infant and toddler stage but who has enough common sense to not introduce distance weapons. The most you can hope for is to get the patient to adulthood with work and survival skills, and in an un-incarcerated state. A patient can behave positively for months to the point where shrinks say he or she is cured. Which is what happened with us. The solution is to enjoy the up-side, dodge the down side, not take your child's mental illness personally, not let it define you or them, but also have good boundaries because one of the things people with RAD do is play people off against each other. I do have a support team of my own. No worries there.
