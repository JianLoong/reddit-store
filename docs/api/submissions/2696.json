She almost always spends holidays with bio-family, a boyfriend's family or a friend's family instead of me. In fact, we've only spent a couple holidays together in the 7 years since she was placed with me. She prefers to stop by, pick up her gifts and leave. She has almost never given me a holiday gift or card although she gives lavishly to her bio-family and to her friends' and boyfriends' families.\n\nMay likes to set me up for humiliation. She likes to make a big deal out of accepting an invitation from me, then not show up or call. She likes it best if I'm left with a big bill, an unused ticket or an empty table. The more other guests see it, the better she likes it. In fact, enough other people saw her pull that stunt enough times, they got the idea that they should stand me up too, or wander in late whenever.

Yesterday May invited me to T-day at her new boyfriend's family's house. I turned it down because I'd already accepted my niece's invitation and there was a time conflict. Also, back in 2017 May and a different boyfriend invited me to a holiday dinner at that boyfriend's family's house, but they hadn't told the hostess (whom I had never met).

Keep the niece's rsvp. You committed to her first anyway. But also if your 'daughter' wants to mend the relationship, she needs to do it on regular days and not just on holidays. \nBut tbh, I doubt she really wants to mend or fix anything for the better. You may want to consider reducing support to her, she's an adult and she has other supports she can lean on that appears to be what she prefers anyway", "NTA. Fool me once... You've been fooled enough, it's time to go NC.", "Wait you're giving this girl money and she treats you this way?", "NTA.\n\nWhat you allow is what will continue. You deserve better. You owe her nothing at this point. \n\nHappy Thanksgiving \ud83d\ude42", "If May wants to earn your trust, she should go to real, measurable effort on non-holiday occasions. It should require none of your effort. This would be a process requiring  her to display consistent kindness over time. \n\nShe shouldn't be given a hope in hell of being in a position to ruin yet another special day. \n\nBut because the behavior you've described is calculated and sadistic, please be careful before giving her another chance. Lots of young adults are flaky or thoughtless before they have a chance to grow up a bit but what you describe is abnormal. Taking pleasure from being deliberately cruel to a person who loves you and is therefore vulnerable to you is abnormal.  You don't owe it to May to make yourself vulnerable in order to see if she's grown past this behavior yet. People who display these traits seldom truly do. You deserve better from a daughter to whom you gave your best. I'm sorry.", "NTA. At this point it sounds like you\u2019re protecting yourself for good reason. IMHO, if she has changed /matured she\u2019s should go out of her own way to prove it to you. Thank you for adopting someone who needed you, I\u2019m sorry she\u2019s not showing it.", "NTA.\n\nYou made plans with your niece and should not be expected to change them because a later invitation came in.  If it was the queen/king, then maybe but she isn't, so no.\n\nIf you suspect (or hope) that she might want to build a relationship, let her actions show you before you invest something like a major holiday into the relationship.\n\nEnjoy your holiday with your niece.  I'm sure it will be delightful.", "NTA - Have thanksgiving with your niece and enjoy the day.  May has some issues and I can guarantee that she's designed something to make you look stupid.  Even declining the invitation would have her saying you didn't want to see her.  This is something you can't win. \n\nIf she's in her 20's and you've only had her for 7 years this means that she would've been at least 15 or 16 when she moved in with you.  Was it a formal adoption?  It seems fast, especially as she seems to have a very strong bond with her biofamily.  To the point where I'm confused why she was placed with you in the first place as it seems that family could've taken her in.\n\nThe fact she was even in the foster system usually means there's a big issue somewhere.  Does she have any diagnoses?\n\nRegardless, she's an adult.  Time to cut the apron strings to someone that only seems to want to hurt you.  It doesn't sound like she wants to be your daughter.  She just wants to humiliate you and perhaps like the financial support that you give her.  Perhaps it's time to walk away and let her biofamily pick up the slack.", "NTA. If the bf's family was inviting you then they should be reaching out instead of your daughter. Besides, you already said yes to your neice.", "INFO: Why are you continuing to give financial support to someone who delights in humiliating you?", "NTA. She seems like a toxic user. I would've done the same thing.", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry this happened to you. Must have been incredibly hurtful. I love that you\u2019re focusing on yourself and finding joy again in travel and other interests. Go to your niece\u2019s as planned. If May wants to have an adult relationship with you, she\u2019ll have to regain your trust. And a Thanksgiving dinner won\u2019t do it, even if this time is for real real (big question marks here).", "Sad to say she does not seem to even like you. I think you should cut your loses and move on. NTA", "NTA. Go see your niece. In fact if you stopped offering May financial support and never bought her another gift you still wouldn\u2019t be the asshole.", "NTA, man I'm not sure why you have any contact with someone who treats you so badly. It's especially awful since you were willing to stand in the gap for her when the people she actually treats well shit all over her!", "NTA - OP leaving aside all of the petty and cruel things your daughter has put you through, you RSVP'd already with your niece. Nothing to feel guilty about. Nothing to explain. Nothing  further to consider. Enjoy thanksgiving with your niece!", "nta and quit giving her money she\u2019s just using you", "NTA, she is setting you up again. Don't let her. Go spend Thanksgiving with your niece.", "NTA but stop giving her money. You're literally paying someone who mistreats you", "YTA for letting her treat you this way.  Stop the financial support.  You are being used!  This girl doesn\u2019t care about you.", "NTA.\n\nSkip this one.  You need to have a discussion away from the holidays and any pending invite.\n\n\u201cYou hurt me when you stand me up or set me up to look like a fool in front of strangers.  You have done it time and again, and it hurt.  It hurt every time.  You are an adult now.  I love you, but you are more than old enough to face the natural consequences of your behavior.  I would love to spend more time with you.  I care about you deeply.  But now it is time for you to cultivate our relationship.  It\u2019s a two way street and I am happy to meet you privately at a convenient restaurant or at your home, but you will need to do the planning.  If not, then I know I have loved you so much and will let you have the relationship you want.  I will always be open to trying again, but I am not playing this game anymore.  It will all stop now, one way or the other.\u201d\n\nShe will deny what she is doing, because she wants your money.  You don\u2019t need her to acknowledge it.  You know what is happening and so does she.\n\n\u201cOkay if you see it that way.  Let me know when you want to try to have a real relationship again.\u201d\n\nAnd stop paying.  Gradually if you like, but stop.", "NTA but I would be cutting off the financial support.", "NTA for not going to dinner.  YTA for continuing to pay for her when she doesn\u2019t see you past what she can get from you.", "NTA.  I\u2019m curious- why do you provide any support for her and - based solely on what you\u2019ve outlined in your post - why haven\u2019t you gone completely NC with this person who treats you like trash?  If I was treated even slightly the way she treats you, she\u2019d never hear from me again, and the financial assistance would certainly be stopped.  You deserve better than to be used as an ATM.", "So you adopt a teen girl from foster care, you supported her, give her nice holiday gifts and she treats you with humiliation and embarrassment.

I would get a big box fill it with dog poo, wrap it nicely and say this is a perfect representation of how you treat me.\n\nForget the ungrateful little *#$&@$#& and start going to family events\n\nNta... How ungrateful can one person actually be?", "Please go to your niece for Thanksgiving and have a wonderful time. Happy Thanksgiving you deserve it.", "NTA, you've already rsvp'd to another event. You'd be rude to then switch it up to run to an event where you are only being invited by someone who is a guest, AKA someone who shouldn't be inviting other people along at all, who is more than likely either going to set you up to not be invited, or to be disrespected.\n\nHonestly it sounds like the core issue here is that you should take the money that you are spending on her, and put it towards therapy so you can deal with why you are continuing to run to someone who treats you so poorly and only has a relationship with you based on money. You need to go no contact, put in the work toward that", "Big NTA. You seem like a good person. A few thoughts from my side:\n- May is a cruel person. She doesn't respect you. \n- Your hunch seems pretty reasonable about the invitation being a prank. \n- Even if she says that she wants to mend ways, because her only motivation seems either any money that she gets from you, or another mega humiliation plan in progress.\n- Anyway, I personally feel that she does not deserve a second chance.\n- Take care, OP!", "NTA: May is behaving like someone who only sees you as a means to an end for gifts and that's about it. It would okay if you set boundaries going forward on how you want to be treated. May probably is resentful she was removed from bio families home, but that is not your fault OP.", "It's also possible that you could accept your daughter's invitation, but go to your niece's as planned.  I think YWNBTA to be that petty, just for once.", "NTA. It would be rude to cancel on your niece. I am sorry you are going through this.", "You are NTA. I'm sorry she has treated you that way. That's incredibly sad. I think go to your niece as promised. Have a lovely Thanksgiving with them and let May do whatever she wants. She may legally be your daughter but she is not behaving like one and you do not need to subject yourself to that behavior again.", "The more other guests see it, the better she likes it. *In fact, enough other people saw her pull that stunt enough times, they got the idea that they should stand me up too, or wander in late whenever.* I take a lot of effort to cook a good meal so it sucks to be stood up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nthis is too strange. people don't just start doing that kind of thing because someone else does it, I really question the assumptions you are making about people's actions and motivations.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Until she's ready to put in the work of properly dealing with that and showing results outside of charged situations like holidays, you are correct in protecting yourself.\n\nMaybe eventually she'll realize that she can't prove to herself that you won't abandon her like her bio-family, and stop being so cruel.  I wouldn't count on it, because admitting things like that is pretty painful and who wants that?\n\nYou should carry on as you are.\n\nI wish you well. And I hope that May heals, someday."]}
