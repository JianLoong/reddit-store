Among them was Mary (24F) an old friend who I hadn't seen in a while. We've known each other for years, but our paths had diverged and we hadn't kept in touch as much as we used to.\n\nAs the evening progressed, we were all having a good time, reminiscing about old times and catching up on life. At one point, I had to step away to take a phone call. I left my laptop open on the coffee table, not thinking much of it. I mean, we were all friends, right?\n\nWhen I returned, I found Mary sitting in front of my laptop (no she did not ask me to use it), her eyes wide with what I can only describe as 'hunger'. I felt a knot in my stomach and asked her what she was doing, trying to keep my composure. She looked up, a smirk playing on her lips, and said she was just browsing. I brushed it off, not wanting to cause a scene, but I couldn't shake off the uneasy feeling.\n\nFast forward to later in the evening. We were all gathered in the living room, sharing stories and laughter. Suddenly, Mary decided it was story time. She without skipping a beat, started going off on things that I had never shared with anyone in that room. She phrased it kinda like \"Someone in this room is into..... \" and immediately looked at me and started giggling. My heart sank. I realized she had found that information on my laptop. I felt my face burning with embarrassment as my friends started ripping into me in laughter. I felt betrayed, humiliated, and angry.\n\nIn a fit of rage, I confronted Mary, right there in front of everyone. I shouted at her, accusing her of invading my privacy and betraying my trust. The room fell silent. Mary looked taken aback, and then defensive. I had gone 0 to 60 in a few seconds and clearly looked very angry. She said it was just a joke and that I was overreacting. I was like 'this is BS and I'm not having it'. The evening started to wind down after that outburst.\n\nSince then, I've been getting messages from some friends saying that I am TA. But all I did was react to a gross violation of my privacy. I feel like I'm in a whirlwind of confusion and hurt. Am I some raging monster who cant control my anger? I honestly feel everyone is taking her side because they see her as some poor defenseless damsel in distress and I'm the big bad vengeful wolf who cant take a joke.\n\nINFO: The information was stored in a place where its very difficult to get access to unless your actively searching the computer. No it was not open, and yes you can see the title of what it is and know what it is without opening. The file was opened, and definitely searched through.\n\nTLDR; My 'friend' saw private information on my laptop without my permission and humiliated me, i reacted by getting angry and yelling.\n\nSo, Reddit, I turn to you. AITA?\n\nETA: Its not p\\*rn guys. I would have been okay with that. Also stop DMing me asking for the details, its personal.\n\nETA 2.0: Although I appreciate the support, Incels who are messaging me to give them her social media so they can harrass her will not be entertained. Also shoutout to the one guy who sent me a similar story about him getting expelled from his Uni after his friend leaked his info. Made me feel better.

They don't seem to have hesitated at a chance to see you humiliated, and some are even judging you for getting mad at the asshole who did so. \nTheir are two related, but separate incidents Mary is an ahole here. The first is searching your computer without permission. Even if you were technically being careless  leaving it unattended, that doesn't give her the right to search through it. The second is sharing that information, no matter how it was obtained. The sole purpose was to hurt you, and you had every right to get mad. \nThe whole, \"not going to actually say a name but will signal in every way I can who I'm talking about, because plausible deniablity,\" in particular is an utterly disgusting verbal ploy, and should be called out like the viper's tactic it is.", "NTA - She crossed a line, and then crossed another.

Then they\u2019ll really know what it feels like.", "NTA\n\nI think it was normal for you to react like that because you were embarrassed. Defensive anger is a pretty standard reaction I think. Like somebody else here said, without knowing what it involved, it's a little hard to judge, but the fact that she was laughing about it makes me think that it isn't anything really shocking or offensive, so in that case, it's your business and she had no right to bring it up in front of everyone, or to snoop around your laptop in the first place.", "NTA.
