Among them was Mary (24F) an old friend who I hadn't seen in a while. We've known each other for years, but our paths had diverged and we hadn't kept in touch as much as we used to.\n\nAs the evening progressed, we were all having a good time, reminiscing about old times and catching up on life. At one point, I had to step away to take a phone call. I left my laptop open on the coffee table, not thinking much of it. I mean, we were all friends, right?\n\nWhen I returned, I found Mary sitting in front of my laptop (no she did not ask me to use it), her eyes wide with what I can only describe as 'hunger'. I felt a knot in my stomach and asked her what she was doing, trying to keep my composure. She looked up, a smirk playing on her lips, and said she was just browsing. I brushed it off, not wanting to cause a scene, but I couldn't shake off the uneasy feeling.\n\nFast forward to later in the evening. We were all gathered in the living room, sharing stories and laughter. Suddenly, Mary decided it was story time. She without skipping a beat, started going off on things that I had never shared with anyone in that room. She phrased it kinda like \"Someone in this room is into..... \" and immediately looked at me and started giggling. My heart sank. I realized she had found that information on my laptop. I felt my face burning with embarrassment as my friends started ripping into me in laughter. I felt betrayed, humiliated, and angry.\n\nIn a fit of rage, I confronted Mary, right there in front of everyone. I shouted at her, accusing her of invading my privacy and betraying my trust. The room fell silent. Mary looked taken aback, and then defensive. I had gone 0 to 60 in a few seconds and clearly looked very angry. She said it was just a joke and that I was overreacting. I was like 'this is BS and I'm not having it'. The evening started to wind down after that outburst.\n\nSince then, I've been getting messages from some friends saying that I am TA. But all I did was react to a gross violation of my privacy. I feel like I'm in a whirlwind of confusion and hurt. Am I some raging monster who cant control my anger? I honestly feel everyone is taking her side because they see her as some poor defenseless damsel in distress and I'm the big bad vengeful wolf who cant take a joke.\n\nINFO: The information was stored in a place where its very difficult to get access to unless your actively searching the computer. No it was not open, and yes you can see the title of what it is and know what it is without opening. The file was opened, and definitely searched through.\n\nTLDR; My 'friend' saw private information on my laptop without my permission and humiliated me, i reacted by getting angry and yelling.\n\nSo, Reddit, I turn to you. AITA?\n\nETA: Its not p\\*rn guys. I would have been okay with that. Also stop DMing me asking for the details, its personal.\n\nETA 2.0: Although I appreciate the support, Incels who are messaging me to give them her social media so they can harrass her will not be entertained.

Also, put a password on your computer.", "NTA I would be very embarrassed if while sitting around with my hardcore punk friends someone dug through my shit and pulled up my Nsync albums stored in my D drive where I hid them after downloading the torrent and wiping all evidence if the theft from my C drive.", "NTA a million times over! What god given right does *anyone* have to go through someone's personal stuff and then try and make them feel small by talking about it. Jesus, no wonder you lost touch with her. i would do it again - and I would find a new circle of friends who actually respect privacy instead of trying to normalise this kind of grossness.", "NTA Just ask the friend group if they would mind if you went through all their personal mail, DMs etc etc **AND** then would also be ok with you making comments on whatever you find to the group.", "What the fuck is this sub lol your whole first half is waffling about how OP didnt handle it well enough by yelling and your solution is to make a fuckin physical threat while also being precognizant of the topic based on a couple words and hindsight? Lol", ">So you were actively using your laptop during your catch-up with somebody you hadn't seen in years?  That's really the only way it would be sitting there, unlocked.  \n>  \n>Then you got up to take a phone call?  In this day and age?  Bullshit.\n\nSo, first off. OP never said that the computer was unlocked. They just said it was OPEN. Second, people still take phone calls. Me? I'm a member of the younger section of Gen Z, and I take phone calls and make phone calls. It's not all that unusual. And to your note about Mary, it wasn't a search. There's a place called Finder on MacBooks which has all downloaded documents, etc, which is where OP seems to have these documents, as they said: \"The information was stored in a place where it's very difficult to get access to unless you're actively searching the computer. No, it was not open, and yes you can see the title of what it is and know what it is without opening. The file was opened, and definitely searched through.\" OP may have had the file in a subfolder of a folder, meaning you had to know where to look to find the first folder, then know what folder it was in, then access the file.", "Tbh there's plenty of good reasons to have your laptop out catching up with friends - playing games together, watching a movie, showing them some photos, 'wtf you don't know this song? I'll find it on youtube', etc etc.", "You're NTA at all. It's possible that some of the people who were there at the time didn't view it as a big deal because they didn't see it as a big \"reveal.\" They just saw it as finding out about something you're into.\n\nHowever, I disagree. As someone who is very into privacy, if a friend, acquaintance, or partner revealed even minor information about my personal interests to a group, I'd feel angry and violated. I think that's what your friends aren't picking up on - that even though THEY didn't see the information as particularly secret-worthy, it was not this woman's to share.", "I think they meant relationship as in friend relationship (friends, nothing more, nothing less)", "Are we really victim blaming here? Maybe he was using his computer to show them something or had a last minute work/school issue or was asked to share something? Maybe the phone call was an emergency or a guest who hadn't arrived yet or a family member? Adult life doesn't do just because your friends come over. Should he have tried to avoid using them? Maybe, but that still isn't an open invitation to go through his computer and shsre his secrets.", "Have you asked them how they\u2019d react if the genders were reversed? I hate using that as a point, but people tend to take women\u2019s privacy more seriously than men\u2019s.", "Lol victim blaming is a super strong word. Look, I\u2019m simply pointing out there\u2019s a really clear way to have avoided it and if you know you have personal/sensitive stuff on a device, don\u2019t leave it unattended. I specifically always close my devices when I walk away from them for *exactly* this reason, on top of like I said, it\u2019s generally considered pretty rude to have a bunch of people over that you haven\u2019t seen in awhile and then be on your laptop. He wasn\u2019t at work, there was no work emergency so great he would need to be working while hosting a party but not so great that he wouldn\u2019t need to cancel said party, that makes no sense. Once you\u2019re off the clock, unless it\u2019s literal life or death, most jobs don\u2019t expect you to answer until the next morning at the earliest.\n\nNot calling him an AH because he was embarrassed, but I feel like no one is pointing out him being on the laptop at all is pretty weird during a party that he himself is hosting.", "Don't know why you're getting downvoted. This is practical advice. If he apologizes, friends are cool, if he doesn't, friends are not. What he's gotta do depends on the desired outcome."]}
