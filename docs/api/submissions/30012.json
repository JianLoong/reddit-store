We have been engaged since the birth of our kid 5 years ago. Due to a number of circumstances, chiefly finances, we have had a long engagement.\n\nI have been friends with Caitlyn (31F) since grade school, and although we are not \u201cbest friends\u201d we have had a long and joyful friendship that means a lot to me. I went to Caitlyn\u2019s wedding to her college sweetheart, which happened when she was freshly graduated at 23.\n\nUnfortunately, her husband was found in a bathroom stall with his coworker at the reception. My heart broke for her, and I was part of her support system in the aftermath. She is now happily remarried with two kids of her own.\n\nIn planning my wedding, the one thing I\u2019ve been struggling with for years is the dress. My body image is poor, and I have an unusually large chest that makes all clothes shopping awful. But I went thrift shopping last week, and found THE DRESS. It was everything I could have dreamed of, and it FITS ME! I literally fell to my knees crying in the dressing room. Right away, I sent a photo to everyone I could think of, including Caitlyn. She called me immediately. I didn\u2019t see it then, but when I got home, I saw that I had multiple missed calls and texts from Caitlyn.\n\nSo, it\u2019s her wedding dress from her marriage to her ex. Apparently, she finally decided to let go of it. Since it was so long ago, I genuinely didn\u2019t recognize it. It\u2019s also not as if she goes around parading her wedding photos. Once she said it, I remembered right away. It also made sense, as one of the things she and I bond over is boob size. I tried to laugh it off, but she said, \u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019ll let you return it, under the circumstances.\u201d I felt sick to my stomach because it was obvious she didn\u2019t want me to wear the dress, and I was already super attached to it.\n\nI stopped engaging for the rest of the night and talked it over with my fianc\u00e9 and some other friends. Opinions are split. Some know how hard this process has been for me, and think Caitlyn is being petty. Honestly, I don\u2019t. I get where she\u2019s coming from. But I literally cannot keep looking. And it was $30. I have a 5 year old. I would love to spend wedding dress money on her instead.\n\nSome say that it\u2019s not only a bad omen, but disrespectful to ask Caitlyn to look at me in her dress. Imo, Caitlyn has moved on and has a family. If the roles were reversed, I would be thrilled for her. That said, I do understand that I could be the AH by reminding a friend I do love of one of the worst day of her life.\n\nI tried talking to her about it the next day, but she has been firm on not attending my wedding if I wear the dress. She actually said she is rethinking the friendship in general. I am gutted, and don\u2019t really think that\u2019s fair. I would love to find a solution that allows me to keep the dress and my friend, which is why I am posting here. AITA?

I'm talking changing the sleeves, length, neckline, adding embellishment.  I agree with you that finding an inexpensive dress when you have a very large chest is basically like finding a unicorn.", ">I could be the AH by reminding a friend I do love of one of the worst day of her life  \n\n\nI cannot fathom the embarrassment and pain your friend went through that day. Logically I agree with you that it's just a dress, but I see her side here as well. NAH - is there any way you could alter the dress a little, so it still fits you the way you like but isn't as visually \"the same\"?", "Can you imagine, you are at your wedding.  You get married and then find your new husband cheating on you at the reception.  That\u2019s got to be about the most painful way to find that out.  Then your really good friend gets married and you have to look at her in your dress.  The dress you suffered through that day.  A symbol of being so hurt and so wronged thrown in your face.  Then you get to see that dress all over your social media, in your house, and probably on your phone.  I completely get her not wanting to attend.  You can wear it, but don\u2019t expect her to be there, congratulate you or anything else.  She may be okay seeing you eventually.", "NAH...but I wouldn't want to have anything to do with it.  It's got bad energy.  \n\n\nAnd I'm NOT one of those crystals and zodiac girls either...but the circumstances surrounding it would be enough for me to not want to be anywhere near it not even if it were altered to be unrecognizable.  \n\nPlus it would hurt your friend terribly... you would be within your rights, technically, but it is worth it?", "NAH I wouldn't get married in someone else's bad luck wedding dress but to each their own.", "Yta, she\u2019s told you her answer. I completely see where she is coming from and I wouldn\u2019t be strong enough to come to that wedding. Is there anything you can do to change the dress? Have you asked her if there are any options? \n\nIf it was my good friend who I loved I wouldn\u2019t wear it.", "NAH. I mean, no one could have predicted this, it\u2019s so bizarre. But your friend will associate this with one of the worst days of her life. I don\u2019t believe in karma, but\u2026. Ugh. I couldn\u2019t feel good about wearing that dress. My suggestion would be to find a similar dress (same manufacturer?) on a second hand website. If you think you can actually feel good about this dress, and are okay risking your friendship over it, then I guess go for it. But it seems like it will inevitably create a huge amount if controversy and drama when people find out- and they absolutely will.", "YTA. I had a perfectly amicable divorce and would still think it was super weird if one of my friends wore my old wedding dress to get married in. If I\u2019d seen my husband cheat on me at my wedding and the friend who comforted me through that wanted to wear my dress, and expected me to go to the wedding and see her in it, I would absolutely find that disrespectful. \n\nI also do not think you would actually be thrilled for her if the roles were reversed, it\u2019s just what people tell themselves to feel better about hideous actions. If your husband fucks someone else at your reception and another friend wants to use your dress after for her wedding, where you\u2019ll be a guest, would you be *thrilled* for her? Really?\n\nFor everyone who is saying she\u2019s not over her ex, it\u2019s very possible to be over someone and still find parts of your history with that person traumatizing.", "YTA. She has made it perfectly clear were she stands and you are still trying to find a way to get everything you want. You will not be able to keep the dress and the friend. Period. It\u2019s up to you which is more important.", "One billion dressed and u have to wear hers?", "NAH, it\u2019s totally reasonable for you to want to wear a dress that fits you and was inexpensive, but it\u2019s also totally reasonable for her to not want to attend and see the dress and be reminded of the trauma of her first wedding. \n\nIf it were me in your shoes, it really would come down to how much I value Caitlyn\u2019s friendship. If you really don\u2019t want to lose her as a friend, you might have to bite the bullet and continue your dress hunt (though now you might have a better idea of what to look for since you did find one that fit you!)", "NAH since you already bought it, but I don\u2019t think a dress is worth losing a friendship over. And do you really want to look at your photos ins decades and always remember this drama of the dress?", "Can you do some alterations or embellishments to the dress to make it more \u201cyour own\u201d dress? Maybe if it looks slightly different everyone will feel more comfortable.  \n\nUltimately she gave the dress away.  Someone was going to wear it.  If she was afraid of ever seeing it again she should have destroyed it.", "YTA.  Pretty dresses are nice, but a friendship is worth more.", "I'm slightly fashion obsessed, and I can say with certainty that some relatively inexpensive alterations and/or accessories can make a huge difference in the look of the dress. In general, they're all sleeveless, they're all white, and there's a few standard shapes. They all look different because of things like lace and beadwork. Obviously, this depends on the dress itself, but adding a sparkly belt, adding/replacing some of the lace appliques, even adding a pop of color can make it look like a whole new dress. \n\nStop by your local craft store and get some options and just pin them on the dress. Talk to your friend and show her the dress with the alterations. There's a good chance she'll agree that it looks totally different.", "NTA, she gave the dress to a thrift store, you bought it fair and square. If you genuinely want to still wear it, and don't want to offend her, have some modifications made. Add some extra lace, bows, beading, change the length, add/remove a train, add/remove sleeves, something to change this dress so it's not her dress anymore. A talented seamstress could modify the dress, without changing how it fits, so that it's near unrecognizable.", "You are NTA. She donated the dress to a thrift store. She has no more claim on it.  To complain about your wearing it apparently years later, when she has moved on and had a family with someone else screams that she's not over her ex. \n\nFrankly, if the dress I wore when I married my ex fit one of my friends, she loved it, and she wanted to wear it, I'd let her have it and offer to have it dry cleaned for her. I may not have the best memories of the marriage, but it's a beautiful dress, and I have wonderful memories of picking out that dress with my mother. If someone else I cared about could give it new life and more good memories, more power to her. \n\nBut that's me, not your friend. She is upset by the thought of seeing you married in the dress and has chosen this hill to die on. Looks like you may have to choose between the dress and the friendship.", "NAH - im sure your friend does not want to be reminded of this day but, well you didnt know and the dress works for you. Youre kind of in a tough spot here but tbh id maybe look for another dress.", "NAH but would you rather have your friendship with caitlyn or wear the dress because you can't have both. you will lose her as a friend if you wear it.", "NTA. Oh brother.", "NTA, it was in a donation shop and you didn't recognize it when you purchased it. You already made an emotional connection to it prior to realizing it was her dress from ALMOST A DECADE AGO. That is now your dress.\n\nYour friend is being overly emotional about this and very selfish  Had you not sent the picture to her, she wouldn't have been any wiser about it.\n\nKeep the dress, it's a damn unicorn to fit you like that and, like you said, you have a small child and a new dress could cost thousands.", "NTA. If it was so bad, she could have thrown it in a dumpster or torched it.  But she donated it - to a LOCAL thrift store. If it were me, I\u2019d say \u201cWhat a happy coincidence. Please wear it! Then it will be associated with something wonderful\u201d  ETA: Downvotes for me saying she\u2019s NTA, and trying to put a positive spin on the dress? Wow, ok", "NTA, go to joanne fabric and get some new lace trim and change the look slightly. with slight modifications no one including her will know it\u2019s her old dress.", "NTA but maybe you could add something to make it look a little different like a belt\nOr something", "NTA. Once she gave away the dress, she also gave away having any say in who wears it next. I would absolutely make some alterations to it but other than that, go ahead and wear it.\n\nIf I was Caitlyn and you were my best friend, I'd be ecstatic for you! I ended up saving you alot of money, played a part in finding a dress that you'll feel beautiful in on your wedding day and got some a little \"karmic justice\" against my deadbeat ex-husband. What more could I want for my best friend??\n\nThis isn't about you. This is about issues Caitlyn hasn't dealt with fully. The fact that she's dumping her trauma on you is incredibly selfish. This is what I would say to Caitlin, \n\n\"I wasn't aware that this was your dress when I bought it. But you did give it away for someone else to use. I love this dress and it makes me feel beautiful. I'm going to make some changes, but I will be wearing it on my wedding day. I'm sorry that it brings up some bad memories for you. However I hope you'll be able to attend and celebrate my wedding with me.\" And then don't engage on this topic any further. \n\nBeyond that it's HER choice.", "NTA She's rethinking the friendship in general?  Wow.  She can't be happy for you?  Have the dress dry cleaned, toast her good taste, and wear it in good health.  Friends don't always stay friends.  It's alright to focus on you, and your upcoming nuptials.   Let people go with an open hand and a good heart.", "NTA.  Your wedding. Your finances. Your dress. If she's that petty that she would end a friendship over this, she's not worth your time.", "She is being petty and hasn\u2019t gotten over her first husband.   Tell her you are sorry that she feels that way, that you will miss her at the wedding.  My DIL apparently wore the same wedding dress one of her cousins did.  As a compromise is there something you could change about the dress that would make it more custom to you?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

While it's understandably difficult to find something flattering in your size that you love, your friend has suddenly told you that it's hurtful for you to wear her exact dress that holds such traumatic memories. Since cost is an issue, maybe you could ask to borrow her dress from her second wedding, or look at pre-owned dress websites?", "ESH... \n\nSince she already messaged you about returning it she is expecting you to do so for the sake of your friendship. **There is no way to keep the dress and keep the friendship. She will not allow that and has said it clearly.** \n\n*Is the dress more important than your friendship? Is she coming to the wedding?* \n\nSometimes we have to do things we do not want to do like giving up the perfect dress for someone else's peace of mind. Some of also do not care about things like this and others like your friend cannot let go. TBH if I had been her I would have torched it. That is me.", "There's no AH's here just a really awkward unhappy choice.\n\nAnd you have to make it. Ask yourself what you'd rather have in 10 years; the friend or the dress?", "NTA.  Why would you keep a wedding dress with that history for nearly 10yrs?  Quite frankly your friend is weird as hell and if she\u2019s willing to blow up a longtime friendship over this she\u2019s not really your friend.\n\nAdvise your ex-friend your wearing the dress and she won\u2019t be receiving an invite so problem solved.   Tell her you hope she gets some therapy to help with her obvious trauma and wish her a good life and block her on everything.", "I was going to suggest the same. There must be cheap modifications which could be done to change the look of the dress. \n\nNAH", "Yeah this is how I feel. I don\u2019t really believe clothes have energy but considering what happened to the last bride WHILE she was wearing the dress, I would not have any interest in wearing it for my wedding.", "That was my thought, can you make changes to it?.", "So her ex literally couldn\u2019t keep it in his pants for a couple of hours? Dude\u2019s got problems. And NAH, you can wear the dress. Just know it will cost you a friendship. And for all the people telling you to change it up a bit, she\u2019ll definitely know.", "I can totally understand how you're feeling right now, and you are entitled to your feelings, but your friend is obviously important to you. She has set a very clear boundary, so you have a choice to make. \n\nMaybe something for you to consider: picture yourself in 15 years. Your life with your husband, kid/s. Looking back on your wedding photos and reminiscing. In 15 years, will you be happier looking back seeing yourself in this dress, or will you be happier seeing your friend by your side and reminiscing with her?", "This is super sticky. On one hand I see your side, you found the unicorn dress, on the other your friend has some pretty significant trauma associated with said unicorn. Since you got a great deal on it could you use the bust and have someone alter the bottom and make a new dress using the pieces?", "YWBTA - I know people are gonna come for me for this but here's why I think so:\n\nYou're not the asshole because you happened to buy the dress. You didn't know. And she also chose to donate it. There was no way in hell she thought her friend would just-so-happen to buy the same dress she donated. \n\nBut I think knowledge of a situation is important in moments like this when determining who is in the wrong: if you wore the dress to your wedding with no idea what it meant, you would not be the asshole because it would be an accident. However, your friend immediately rushed to try to tell you it was the dress that was supposed to be her special dress that turned out to be the dress she wore on what turned out to be probably the worst day of her life while she got cheated on as well. She has told you it will hurt her badly if you wear something that directly symbolizes the worst day of her life. She finally worked up the courage to get rid of it after years and her friend has brought it back into her life (not your fault of course)\n\nIt sucks you spent money on it and you are well within your rights to wear it. The question is do you love the dress enough to give up your friendship? You said you are attached to it- but are you more attached to a dress or to a friend you've had for years?\n\n Because I suspect that will be the trade-off ultimately. And I honestly wouldn't blame your friend. I imagine watching a friend get married in the exact dress that was supposed to be yours and then got cheated on in would be extremely painful and hard to see. (I guarantee she was also attached to that dress. It was her special thing and despite heartbreak she held onto it for years- it definitely meant something to her).\n\n I don't know how important she is to you but if I were you in this situation I would do literally whatever it takes to avoid wearing that dress. Even if it I couldn't afford a different dress, and had to wear something that wasn't wedding attire.", "YWBTA. \n\nIt\u2019s not just the same style, it\u2019s her *actual* wedding dress. The one she was wearing when she discovered that she was being cheated on.\n\nYour friend matters more than a dress. There are millions of wedding dresses out there, you\u2019ll be able to find another one that you like.", "YTA\n\nWho are you to say she\u2019s moved on? Does one really ever get over being cheated on at their wedding reception? If your partner cheats on you while you\u2019re wearing that cursed dress, how would you feel?\n\nI don\u2019t understand how you can\u2019t see why this is awful and you\u2019re a very shallow and shortsighted person if you choose this dress over a friendship.\n\nAlso, you\u2019ve been with this guy for over a decade and have a child together. How about you save the little money you have and put it towards something useful and not an elaborate wedding that you can\u2019t afford?", "Gentle YTA.\n\nShe apparently held onto the dress for quite awhile after her failed wedding, indicating at least some level of attachment to it despite the awful memories. It\u2019s entirely possible that when she looks back on that day, how much she loved that dress might be her only fond memory or bright spot.\n\nSeeing someone else wear THE dress she loved get the happy ending she didn\u2019t get is likely pretty painful to her. It\u2019s not about the dress being cursed or bad juju, it\u2019s about the hurt she experienced.\n\nI know money is tight, and I know firsthand how hard it is to find a flattering wedding gown that will accommodate a large chest, but it\u2019s not worth hurting your friend over.", "YTA.\n\n> I would love to find a solution that allows me to keep the dress and my friend\n\nShe has made it clear that this isn't possible. I can see where some of the N-A-H's are coming from but OP's attitude of \"what's the big deal, she's moved on\" is just so dismissive and AHish considering Caitlyn has literally said it bothers her and is causing her to reconsider the friendship.", "I feel for both of you. But it sounds like it would kill the friendship if you wear it. Which is worth most to you? Only you can decide.", "NAH, but if you like her dress that much, use it as a pattern for a new dress, or take it with you to a bridal salon or seamstress to use as a guide.

She may have moved on with her life,  but this was still an absolutely crushing moment in her life. Don't disrespect her like that.", "YWBTA if you actually wore her dress.\n\nAs you said, your friend finally worked up her courage to restart her life. First step - get rid of the wedding dress and all the horrible memories associated with it. I\u2019m sure it felt like a big weight was taken off her shoulders.\n\nNow you want to throw that back in her face. She doesn\u2019t want to see that damned dress on a day she so wants to be happy and celebrate. \n\nAnd don\u2019t alter the dress either - it\u2019s still going to evoke the same emotion.\n\nIf you wear that dress, you will absolutely ruin the wedding for your friend and very likely permanently lose your friendship. Is that really worth it?\n\nI would sincerely apologize and admit you were wrong to dismiss her feelings and tell her *of course, I\u2019m not wearing that stupid thing!*", "YTA - don't do it, I get that shopping is hard, really I do, but it's not worth the drama and losing your friend over it. Or maybe it is? Since you're here asking for the green light when she's already told you how she feels about it.\nHow would you feel if your friend walked down the aisle in a reminder of your failed marriage?", "YTA. Even if she is moved on, it's a terrible thing to do to a close friend. The entire time you're wearing it all she'll be able to see is one of the most painful days of her life. It's one thing if it happens to be the same design but it's another when it's actually HER DRESS that she actively doesn't want you to wear", "It sounds to me as if you have already chosen the dress over your friendship. If you value your friend then you won't wear HER dress. You'll suck it up and find one that doesn't bring back painful memories for someone you claim is a close friend.", "It's a tough one given the savings you make for the dress but then you lose a friend.

And possibly lose some mutual friends as well. That\u2019s up to you to decide.
