We're planning a bachelorette weekend in Vegas since my sister has never been before and has always wanted to go. We plan to be out of the hotel as much as possible, making the most of our trip. \n\nOne of the bridesmaids (28F) recently asked in the groupchat about accommodations for her dog, a fifty-pound Australian shepherd. \n\nI was confused...she wanted to bring her *dog?* \n\nThe bridesmaid said the dog was an ESA (emotional support animal) and that she likes to have her dog there on planes (we live on the east coast and will be flying to Vegas). \n\nWe literally flew to Istanbul together not six months ago without this dog and there was no issue whatsoever. And when we get to Vegas, does she plan on just...keeping her dog all cooped up in her crate the entire time?! The hotel we're booking does have dog-friendly rooms, but doesn't allow pets to roam freely around the hotel room unsupervised - the dog would have to stay in that crate for god-knows-how-long each day. That can't be great for the dog. On top of that, our other younger sister coming on the trip is very allergic to dogs. We don't have the money to just let this one bridesmaid book her own room for just herself and the dog to prevent my younger sister having an allergic reaction. Unless this bridesmaid was willing to pay for a room herself, I told her she couldn't bring her dog on this trip.\n\nI thought that was going to be the end of it, since this was definitely reasonable on my part (in my opinion), but this bridesmaid is now being super pissy with me and saying how it's sooo wrong and horrible of me not to let her bring her ESA. Bearing in mind she's been absolutely fine without the dog in the past on much longer flights. Bearing in mind I even told her she could bring the dog IF she was able to pay for a room of her own so that my sister doesn't have a reaction. \n\nReddit, please just put this one to bed.

In fact there were homeless people going in the hotels designated \u201cdoggy area\u201d.  She will be better off boarding that dog.

She's asking me to just be cool with her bringing her dog and letting this dog stay in the (shared) hotel room with my allergic younger sister and the other bridesmaids. Hotel says that up to two dogs are allowed as long as their combined weight is under 100 pounds. Dog fees will also apply, which...just no. Not doing that. I get that her dog is her ESA for a reason, and I am sympathetic to people needing accommodations for stuff, but this is just some next-level entitlement from this bridesmaid in my opinion. It's not \"ableist\" to say don't bring that poor fucking creature to the most miserable weekend of her life when you've been shown to manage yourself just fine without her on flights before.", "Hotel policy on their website states: \"Up to two dogs are allowed, with a maximum combined weight of less than 100 pounds.\"", "And people pay the appropriate cost or fees to have the dog not disrupt others.

It\u2019s misery being in enclosed spaces with all that loose fur. \n\nBut seriously, if she\u2019s travelled further and longer without the dog, and she plans on leaving the dog cooped up all day\u2026 not only does she not actually need it, she\u2019s also going to subject it to an absolutely miserable time. Aussies are high energy dogs, she\u2019ll have to crate it or it\u2019ll destroy it\u2019s surroundings out of boredom. Why would someone who loves their dog put them through that unnecessarily? Full respect to those who have service dogs that do an essential service for them (including mental health support), but ESAs are just pets.", "I believe airlines require proof of ESA status. Training, certified, etc. 50lbs is not small, and at the very least, she would have to buy the dog a seat.", "Airlines no longer are required to accept ESAs.  The law changed in 2021.  Very few airlines will allow an ESA in the cabin anymore.", "Thanks. Kinda solves the problem, doesn't it...."]}
