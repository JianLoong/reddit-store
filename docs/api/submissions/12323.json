{"id": 12323, "submission_id": "11rocta", "title": "AITA for getting my ex friend kicked out of our friend group due to my service dog?", "selftext": "Hi everyone, \n\nUpdate: from what everyone has said I am clearly NTA. Thank you all for your concern and well wishes. Ana and her family have been blocked and I will no longer be in contact with her. \n\nIt was also brought up to me by another user that their was a similar post posted a few weeks ago from a hosts perspective. This is NOT the same post. My situation happened really recently (allot more recent than whatever the previous post was) I\u2019m shocked to hear this has happened befor, but yeah it\u2019s \ud83d\udcaf not related to ours haha\n\n\nFinally I\u2019ve had a few comments about my dog being \u201ccertified\u201d that I want to clarify. I am not from the US so I\u2019m unsure what your guys process is like, but all I mean is that Bailey has gone through the required testing, training and registration to ensure she is legally aloud to be classified as a service animal :) \n\n\nI just want to start by saying I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m not the A-hole. But my friend and her family are pretty certain that I am. Please bear with me, I\u2019m just wanting some clarity over this situation to make sure I\u2019m not crazy.\n\nI (24 f) have epilepsy. I have a service dog (fully certified) who is trained to help me with my seizures. I have been diagnosed since a child, and I have had my current dog Bailey for 4 years now and she is the bestest girl around. (Before Bailey I had a previous service dog who we had to retire due to age\u2026 but having a service animal is by no means new for me). With her being a service dog she is obviously always with me. \n\nI have a core friend group who hangs out quite often. My one friend; let\u2019s call her Anna) (also 24f) always makes really weird and almost passive aggressive comments about me and Bailey? Ex; dogs shouldn\u2019t come to restaurants, I\u2019m inconveniencing people, etc. she doesn\u2019t get that I legitimately need her for my own safety. It\u2019s not just for show.\n\nMy seizures are really regular; for context I actually get two different kinds. My \u201csmall ones\u201d are petit Mal seizures. This essentially just looks like I\u2019m zoning out and staring into space. Quite often people who don\u2019t know me wouldn\u2019t even connect this. My \u201cbig ones\u201d are my main concern; these are focal seizures where I fully lose consciousness. This can happen a couple times a day for me so it\u2019s obviously really important that I manage it to the best of my abilities. \n\nAnyways. Our friend Anna wanted to host a games night/appy night type thing at her house. When we there she lost it on me. She told me it was increadibly disrespectful that I showed up with Bailey without asking for permission first. That I can\u2019t just assume people will be happy with a dog always being around. That I should have just stayed home if I couldn\u2019t handle being out for a few hours without Bailey. I tried apologizing and pointing out that I assumed she knew I was bringing her since I\u2019ve never gone anywhere without her. That set her off more. The guys were finally able to calm her down but her \u201ccompromise\u201d was I had to put Bailey in the backyard.\n\nI was an idiot and said fine because I didn\u2019t want to inconvenience anyone more or continue stirring the pot. Bailey went out side and I returned inside with my friends. \n\nI ended up having a seizure, blacking out and smashing my head on the floor. I had to go to the hospital because of how hard I hit my head. \n\nI guess my friend group absolutely handed Ana her ass calling her hateful, toxic, and a jealous witch. I guess she was trying to say that I passed out for the attention and I got my way like always. Long story short no one wants her around anymore.\n\nSince this happened her, her sister and mom have been blowing up my phone, calling me the ass hole and demanding I fix this situation and it\u2019s honestly getting to me.. so Reddit.

This is not to be brought up with her or angone.#\n\nFor argument's sake -- Even if a person (who is neutotypical and has no health issues) wanted to intentionally pass out, it would be pretty much impossible to do on a whim if they didn't plan beforehand.\n\nEg:\n\nPeople can intentionally pass out if they didn't eat for a long time, but that is prep and can't be a sudden in-the-moment on will thing.\n\nPeople can intentionally pass out if they took sleep meds, but again this requires premeditation.\n\nAnd you, yourself ***know*** that it wasn't on purpose. \n\nTherefore you are justified and she's an ah for *multiple* reasons such as:\n1. She's just ableist in general\n2. This incident shouldn't have happened in the first place \n3. She blames you for fainting \n4. She tried to turn the friend group against you\n5. She is falsely you of malicious intent. This isn't a \"save face\" reaction, this is her doubling down because she refuses accountability. (A real safe face response would be something like \"I'm sorry I didn't realize OP's condition was that severe / didn't think anything would happen: -- not that it would make hee any better)\n6. She chooses to remain ignorant instead of trying to learn, understand, accept, and be ready to accommodate for your condition \n7. She hasnt apologized.\n8. She's getting her minions (her family) to terrorize you\n9. She either: potentially lied to them about what happened to not look bad so that her minions would back her up, OR she's  deliberately endorsing their behaviour\n10. She continues to blame you *again*, except this time it's for getting herself expunged\n11. She hasn't even tried to be amicable to the others in friendgroup\n\nThis is all just a long-winded way of saying don't you EVER doubt yourself on this situation, or doubt yourself for similar incidents in the future\n\nI'm glad you are alive and recovering (head damage can cause death!)\n\nGive Bailey lots of love \u2764\ufe0f she's a good girl", "Nta.

Literally does not get in the way any more than a regular chair would. They always say something like \u201coh we\u2019ll have it right over here\u201d but it\u2019s a spot like 50-60 feet away. Ma\u2019am if there is an emergency, how am I going to get out of here?? If I need my medication (in my rollator bag) who\u2019s gonna get it?? Once I requested a handicapped seat in a theatre and they refused to allow me to sit in my walker like a wheelchair user would (even though they had wheelchair users seated in the area) and instead wanted me to walk down some stairs and into the middle of a row? Ummmm. \n\nI\u2019d be lying if I said I never \u201caccidentally\u201d swiped someone with my wheel because they were blocking the only handicapped accessible door/bathroom stall/ramp lol", "\"Wheelchair people are the most entitled people I've ever met.\"\n\nService dogs are medical assistance devices. Are they living medical assistance devices? Yes. But it's the only way someone like OP can live. Unless Anna learns how to smell and warn OP of seizures, then she can leave Bailey at home or in the yard. But until then, the medical alert at OPs side should be welcome anywhere OP is.", "bro, what??\n\nare you mixing this up with ESAs?", "She\u2019s been friends with the chick for years. She absolutely knew OP had a service dog.", "My dad and stepmother are completely obnoxious about their pet dog (and I love dogs). They came to visit me & got a pet friendly hotel room, but wouldn't leave the dog at the hotel at all. Which would have been okay, except:\n\n1) I had 2 senior cats. I told them what time we fed the cats in the morning & they showed up w/ their dog a half hour before that. The dog barked & my dad laughed & encouraged it. Of course the cats ran to hide in the bedroom.\n\n2)The dog kept heading towards the bedroom & I had to police it. My stepmother thought we should shut the door, but I told her no, the cats need access to their litterbox.\n\n3)They let the dog jump on and walk over all the furniture. I had to tell my stepmother to get it off a side table.\n\n4)They fed the dog the food I'd prepared. It ate more roast than I did.\n\nIt's little, so they think the behavior is cute and/or okay. Service dogs aren't anything like their dog (neither are pet dogs with responsible owners).", "What's the bet she did not accurately report what happened to her family or they would be telling her off.", "I don\u2019t even know. Her moms always been kinda crazy looking for drama"]}
