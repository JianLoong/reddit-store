But my friend and her family are pretty certain that I am. Please bear with me, I\u2019m just wanting some clarity over this situation to make sure I\u2019m not crazy.\n\nI (24 f) have epilepsy. I have a service dog (fully certified) who is trained to help me with my seizures. I have been diagnosed since a child, and I have had my current dog Bailey for 4 years now and she is the bestest girl around. (Before Bailey I had a previous service dog who we had to retire due to age\u2026 but having a service animal is by no means new for me). With her being a service dog she is obviously always with me. \n\nI have a core friend group who hangs out quite often. My one friend; let\u2019s call her Anna) (also 24f) always makes really weird and almost passive aggressive comments about me and Bailey? Ex; dogs shouldn\u2019t come to restaurants, I\u2019m inconveniencing people, etc. she doesn\u2019t get that I legitimately need her for my own safety. It\u2019s not just for show.\n\nMy seizures are really regular; for context I actually get two different kinds. My \u201csmall ones\u201d are petit Mal seizures. This essentially just looks like I\u2019m zoning out and staring into space. Quite often people who don\u2019t know me wouldn\u2019t even connect this. My \u201cbig ones\u201d are my main concern; these are focal seizures where I fully lose consciousness. This can happen a couple times a day for me so it\u2019s obviously really important that I manage it to the best of my abilities. \n\nAnyways. Our friend Anna wanted to host a games night/appy night type thing at her house. When we there she lost it on me. She told me it was increadibly disrespectful that I showed up with Bailey without asking for permission first. That I can\u2019t just assume people will be happy with a dog always being around. That I should have just stayed home if I couldn\u2019t handle being out for a few hours without Bailey. I tried apologizing and pointing out that I assumed she knew I was bringing her since I\u2019ve never gone anywhere without her. That set her off more. The guys were finally able to calm her down but her \u201ccompromise\u201d was I had to put Bailey in the backyard.\n\nI was an idiot and said fine because I didn\u2019t want to inconvenience anyone more or continue stirring the pot. Bailey went out side and I returned inside with my friends. \n\nI ended up having a seizure, blacking out and smashing my head on the floor. I had to go to the hospital because of how hard I hit my head. \n\nI guess my friend group absolutely handed Ana her ass calling her hateful, toxic, and a jealous witch. I guess she was trying to say that I passed out for the attention and I got my way like always. Long story short no one wants her around anymore.\n\nSince this happened her, her sister and mom have been blowing up my phone, calling me the ass hole and demanding I fix this situation and it\u2019s honestly getting to me.. so Reddit.

One where you injured yourself badly enough to go to the hospital? All so she can keep insisting that your service dog isn't a valid need?  Either she really is this shallow and stupid or she knows she screwed up big time and can't/won't admit it.\n\nIf Anna has this much hostility towards your dog, she and you are not compatible as friends, even in a group setting. It's up to the rest of your friends to decide who they want to hang out with. And it would be okay if they sometimes hung out with her and sometimes hung out with you (not everyone likes dogs; some people are scared, I get it).
