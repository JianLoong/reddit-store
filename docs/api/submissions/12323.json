But my friend and her family are pretty certain that I am. Please bear with me, I\u2019m just wanting some clarity over this situation to make sure I\u2019m not crazy.\n\nI (24 f) have epilepsy. I have a service dog (fully certified) who is trained to help me with my seizures. I have been diagnosed since a child, and I have had my current dog Bailey for 4 years now and she is the bestest girl around. (Before Bailey I had a previous service dog who we had to retire due to age\u2026 but having a service animal is by no means new for me). With her being a service dog she is obviously always with me. \n\nI have a core friend group who hangs out quite often. My one friend; let\u2019s call her Anna) (also 24f) always makes really weird and almost passive aggressive comments about me and Bailey? Ex; dogs shouldn\u2019t come to restaurants, I\u2019m inconveniencing people, etc. she doesn\u2019t get that I legitimately need her for my own safety. It\u2019s not just for show.\n\nMy seizures are really regular; for context I actually get two different kinds. My \u201csmall ones\u201d are petit Mal seizures. This essentially just looks like I\u2019m zoning out and staring into space. Quite often people who don\u2019t know me wouldn\u2019t even connect this. My \u201cbig ones\u201d are my main concern; these are focal seizures where I fully lose consciousness. This can happen a couple times a day for me so it\u2019s obviously really important that I manage it to the best of my abilities. \n\nAnyways. Our friend Anna wanted to host a games night/appy night type thing at her house. When we there she lost it on me. She told me it was increadibly disrespectful that I showed up with Bailey without asking for permission first. That I can\u2019t just assume people will be happy with a dog always being around. That I should have just stayed home if I couldn\u2019t handle being out for a few hours without Bailey. I tried apologizing and pointing out that I assumed she knew I was bringing her since I\u2019ve never gone anywhere without her. That set her off more. The guys were finally able to calm her down but her \u201ccompromise\u201d was I had to put Bailey in the backyard.\n\nI was an idiot and said fine because I didn\u2019t want to inconvenience anyone more or continue stirring the pot. Bailey went out side and I returned inside with my friends. \n\nI ended up having a seizure, blacking out and smashing my head on the floor. I had to go to the hospital because of how hard I hit my head. \n\nI guess my friend group absolutely handed Ana her ass calling her hateful, toxic, and a jealous witch. I guess she was trying to say that I passed out for the attention and I got my way like always. Long story short no one wants her around anymore.\n\nSince this happened her, her sister and mom have been blowing up my phone, calling me the ass hole and demanding I fix this situation and it\u2019s honestly getting to me.. so Reddit.

One where you injured yourself badly enough to go to the hospital? All so she can keep insisting that your service dog isn't a valid need?  Either she really is this shallow and stupid or she knows she screwed up big time and can't/won't admit it.\n\nIf Anna has this much hostility towards your dog, she and you are not compatible as friends, even in a group setting. It's up to the rest of your friends to decide who they want to hang out with. And it would be okay if they sometimes hung out with her and sometimes hung out with you (not everyone likes dogs; some people are scared, I get it).

She's just ableist in general\n2. This incident shouldn't have happened in the first place \n3. She blames you for fainting \n4. She tried to turn the friend group against you\n5. She is falsely you of malicious intent. This isn't a \"save face\" reaction, this is her doubling down because she refuses accountability. (A real safe face response would be something like \"I'm sorry I didn't realize OP's condition was that severe / didn't think anything would happen: -- not that it would make hee any better)\n6. She chooses to remain ignorant instead of trying to learn, understand, accept, and be ready to accommodate for your condition \n7. She hasnt apologized.\n8. She's getting her minions (her family) to terrorize you\n9. She either: potentially lied to them about what happened to not look bad so that her minions would back her up, OR she's  deliberately endorsing their behaviour\n10. She continues to blame you *again*, except this time it's for getting herself expunged\n11. She hasn't even tried to be amicable to the others in friendgroup\n\nThis is all just a long-winded way of saying don't you EVER doubt yourself on this situation, or doubt yourself for similar incidents in the future\n\nI'm glad you are alive and recovering (head damage can cause death!)\n\nGive Bailey lots of love \u2764\ufe0f she's a good girl", "Nta. That girl is literally dangerously stupid, and she clearly got it from her family. I would respond 1 time with a link to this thread, then block them all.", "NTA. Listen, I'm not a fan of having dogs around either, but a service dog?? That's completely different and non-negotiable.\n\nSounds like you all are better off without her tbh", "NTA /", "100% NTA honestly you're better off without Anna in your life; she's extremely toxic and literally put your life in danger.", "You hit your head.  If you were unlucky you could have died or suffered a life altering injury. Concussions are no joke.\nIf you haven\u2019t, I\u2019d tell her she put your life in danger\u2026 for reasons you don\u2019t understand. If her response isn\u2019t reasonable your story should go on social media!", "Block her mom, sister, and her. And anyone who is supporting Anna. Why do they need to have contact with you? \n\nNTA.", "NTA, she put you into a dangerous situation. Never let anyone separate you from your service dog. Drop her like the dead weight she is. (It\u2019s also not your fault how your friends react to someone else so it\u2019s really none of her family\u2019s business)", "NTA- Its a service animal, assuming she knows that (presumably she does as service animals usually have a vest signifying this) then she should know its importance and only invite people she is comfortable hosting with their service animals.", "NTA. She's an idiot for thinking you have control over seizures.", "You really think that we are going to say that you are the arsehole? You are NTA", "NTA and I'm glad all your friends yelled at Anna.", "Omg. I\u2019m so sorry that happened to you. You are NTA. Keep her banished. She sounds toxic.", "NTA, \n\nRemove this toxic waste from your life", "OMG NTA - not in any way shape or form.\n\nMy guess is she takes after her Mom and sister.\nI\u2019m sorry you got bullied out of taking care of yourself. She\u2019s not your friend and hopefully you can learn to set appropriate boundaries and let go of \u2018friends who aren\u2019t friends\u2019 before having a medical emergency.\n\nSending lots of love your way \ud83d\udc95", "Nta", "NTA - but what is exactly her and her family are expecting you to do \"Fix the Situation\".\n\nPerhaps If Anna has shown any remorse or made any more attempts to understand your situation, and depending on what it is they want you to fix, I'd suggest maybe meeting them partway.\n\nBut as it doesn't sound like they have, I'd block and forget..", "Now, I'm not saying you're TA - but you know what she's like about you & your dog, why are you going to her house at all? Not saying she shouldn't accept you & Bailey (I have epilepsy too), but why would you want to go to her house? She's a dick who doesn't believe your condition is real.\n\nEveryone is fully within their rights to not like dogs/allow them in their homes, but they have to say that first.", "NTA. I had a psychiatrist who said that when people are accusing you of things you don\u2019t do it\u2019s because they themselves do those things. Ana is someone who enforces her way on people. Ana is obviously a person who would fake a seizure to get her way. Your friend group is awesome for taking your side and you guys are all better off without her because even if she doesn\u2019t actually do those kind of things, she obviously has a very negative view of her fellow man and interprets everything in the worst way possible and who wants people like that around?", "Absolutely NTA!!\n\nAnna, however, is an ableist bag of ass. She brought this on herself and don't let anyone tell you otherwise. \n\nThankfully you seem to have a great group of friends who have your back. Forget about Anna and focus on them. X", "NTA. I'm sure that if nothing happened that night she would start saying that you don't need the dog after all, or even worse, that you were faking your condition.\n\nThe only way for your friend to \"fix\" this is for her to apologize and acknowledge that she was just annoyed that you had to have a dog around at all times.", "NTA\u2026.block Anna, her sister and her mother.  Anna did this to herself.  Before blocking g, I might reply, \u201cwhat did Anna expect?!  I have a service dog for a reason.  Maybe Anna should educate herself on the use of service dogs before she makes an ass out of herself again.  I am not the one who made this situation and I have nothing to apologize for or try to fix.  That is all on Anna to do.  As for myself, Anna has shown her true colors and as far as I\u2019m concerned, I do not need friends like her in my life.  The rest of my friend group are adults and they can make their own decisions.  Do not ever contact me again.  Or I will pursue harassment charges against you all\u201d.   And block them like a hot potato.", "NTA. She showed her true colors and all friends saw it. That\u2019s not on you, that\u2019s her personality coming to light. If that\u2019s not a likable personality, that\u2019s on her and her parents.", "Jesus Christ, NTA.  What a horrible \"friend\" you had, though.  Good riddance.", "So she gets mad because you had a seizure?? I don't understand anyone who gets mad at people who bring their service dogs!!! \nNTA.", "NTA. She\u2019s absolutely delusional if she thinks you had a seizure on purpose for attention. At least the rest of your friend group stuck up for you. Drop her and keep the rest of them.", "NTA. Please don't listen to that mouldy baguette and her ableism or her ableist family. Her head is so far up her ass, shit comes out her mouth. She is harassing you right now. This is harrasment. \n\nHer expectance that you leave your dog at home or in the yard is no different than people expecting me to leave my wheelchair at home (but you leaving your dog at home is more dangerous). It's not about the dog. She isn't taking your medical condition seriously. Real friends don't treat friends like that.", "Hard NTA and you'd expect someone who witnessed such a traumatic event first hand would now understand your very valid need for a dog...unfortunately she doubled down.", "The only thing you did wrong was cave into her demands. She sounds like the absolute worst and clearly doesn't care about you at all.\n\nBig NTA.\n\nSide note. If it was me. I'd put them on blast and show everyone their ass.", "NTA. Block her and her family. It's not your problems to fix broken people.", "NTA.  Ana did this to herself.  You do not need to justify having a service dog to anyone.  She is a complete AH for her behavior.", "NTA.\n\nIf I\u2019d been at that party I would have handed her ass to her too. \n\nBlock her, the sister and mom. You do what you need for you and props to your friends for sticking up for you.", "NTA. She fucked around, she found out. I\u2019m so sorry that had to include you seriously injuring yourself. I hope you\u2019re okay. And poor Bailey having to sit outside the whole time.\n\nIn the future, if anyone else pretending to be your friend has an issue with Bailey, they need to have it made clear to them that this exact thing could happen again with a much worse outcome, so no one is more important than your NEED for Bailey to be around.", "Yeah, you cracked your head open and landed yourself in the hospital for attention. Sure. \n\nYour friends are right. She is hateful and toxic. It took a drastic thing to happen for them to realize it but ultimately it was purely on Anna that they decided to leave her behind as a friend. \n\nNTA", "100% NTA, but I will request good girl doggo tax. Show us the goodest girl!", "The fact she brought her mommy into her mid twenties friendship drama really cements the mental maturity she\u2019s operating on.\n\nI haven\u2019t seen shit like that since I was 13 and it was always from the trashiest of families.\n\nNta", "NTA \nJust hearing about her behavior makes me hate her guts. It's not your fault her friends saw her for who she really is and didn't like it much.", "NTA people saw her inner ugly on display and want no part of her.", "NTA. Holy cow. Ana was never your friend and she and her whole family are horrible people. Block all of them.", "nta!! anna sounds insufferable, i'm so glad that your friends had your back in the end and i hope they're done with her. i know that people get rightfully upset over poorly behaved \"esa\"s and dogs that people bring with them everywhere for no reason other than 'they're family and i don't do anything without them', but ... bailey is a medical necessity, you need her with you for your well-being, and the fact that she thinks you faked a seizure to prove your point is horrendous.   \nplease note that the only hate-filled messages are coming from anna and her family - nobody else. you did NOTHING wrong, op. give that good girl bailey lots of lovin'!", "The only assholes here are Anna, her sister, and her mother. \n\nOP, Anna is not your friend. \n\nA friend wouldn\u2019t give someone with a diagnosed medical condition grief about bringing a service dog everywhere. That\u2019s akin to complain that someone who is paralyzed from the waist down for using a wheelchair. \n\nIf Anna didn\u2019t want Bailey in her home, that\u2019s fine. She does not have to allow that. A private home is different than a public space. But that means OP should not have been invited, or OP should have been told that this was a \u201cno dogs allowed\u201d situation when the invitation was extended. Perhaps the OP could have made other arrangements for her safety, or had time to realize that her \u201cfriend\u201d is an asshole. \n\nOP, you are NTA. I do hope you learned from this experience, though. If you\u2019re confronted with a situation like this in a private home, LEAVE. It\u2019s not right, and it\u2019s not fair. But your safety is more important.", "To preface this, I am not a dog person.  Never have been, even though I was raised with them (Great Danes).  I don't own dogs (I do have cats). But if you were coming to my house I'd expect you to not only bring your dog but I would ask you in advance if there was anything needed to help the dog and you be in my house.\n\nYou are absolutely NTA.  You are legally allowed to take your service dog with you ANYWHERE.  She's a legally certified and trained service animal for someone with medical needs that depend on the animal's ability to help.  Anna is NOT a friend to you, and is a selfish little brat.  Honestly, I hope your entire friend group circles the wagons and refuses to be around her.", "If your shitty friends could do the simple job your (I\u2019m guessing beautiful and wonderful dog does) maybe the necessity for a support animal would be less necessary, but alas, your shit friends are shit, and cant even grasp the concept of the necessity for an alert dog much less care for you if you seize out.\n\nYour friend Anna sucks, get a new one.", "Fuck her. She could have been responsible for your death that night, and it's your fault?\n\nThe fact that her parent sees no wrong in her actions shows where this entitled behaviour.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. Your dog is not a pet, it is a medical help you NEED. Her behaviour was awful.", "A dear friend of mine died a lot of years ago from hitting her head during an epileptic seizure, the night before her 21st birthday. Fuck Anna.", "I don\u2019t even know how it would be possible to deliberately fake a seizure to the point of smashing your head off of the floor. I don\u2019t think anyone is capable of that except severely mentally unwell people.", "NTA. She literally asked you to put your life at risk because she evidently wasn\u2019t taught basic human decency.", "Or, just as accurately: \nA person on oxygen\nA person in a wheelchair\nA person with a prosthetic.\n\nAnna was demanding a removal of major medical equipment.\n\nGlasses are far too common for Anna's awful self to truly comprehend how abysmal she is.", "If a friend has a service dog for seizures, and you invite them over, it's generally assumed the service dog is coming as it's essentially life saving medical equipment. It takes a special sort of ignorant to then call that person an asshole for something I suspect the majority of people would have also expected. \n\nYou sound as ignorant as the Ana chick and you're also victim blaming. Shameful", "It is assumed when someone with a service animal is invited, their animal comes too. Don\u2019t invite them if you can\u2019t handle it.", "Block her and her family. You don't deserve the hate they give you, and they will never understand they're wrong even if it's explained to them. She literally thought you would put your life in danger to \"prove your point\" - shows what kind of person she is.\n\nYour life will be much easier and way more drama free without her. Unless she sincerely apologizes, she doesn't deserve to talk to you.\n\nAlso; dog tax, pretty please?", "Block them all, dude. Block away.", "You are the victim here and your dog.\n\nSome people are assholes and your friend group just got rid of one. \n\nThat girl and her family can kick rocks.", "Block her family now. If anything, this should have been her wake up call to take you seriously and SHE is the one with a situation to fix.\nI am very glad to hear that your friend group defended you.\nA huge NTA, by any stretch of the imagination.\nAnna sucks.", "I really hope you are OK after the seizure and also hitting you", "Block them.", "Regarding \"taking friends\" - people have minds of their own. I know you pity her, but try to remember she made her own bed, and that your friends decide for themselves who they want to be around. I know it's hard to do if you have people saying someone stole someone else's friends away, but that's not possible to do. People choose how to spend their time, and if they choose not to spend it with Anna, let them choose that.", "if I had been at that party and didn't know you, my friendship with Ana would have ended that night. fucking period\n\neven if you hadn't got hurt and she just made a stink about a service dog, I would have been like what the actual fuck is wrong with this person   \n\nyou didn't take her friends away, she drove them away as aggressively as possible", "It\u2019s not slander if it\u2019s true. Definitely NTA!", "NTA make sure your friends know about the continuing harassment from her family. Your friends deserve to know that they did the right thing. Seeing her sick her family on you will reassure them they were right about her", "Yeah, unless OP has undisclosed magical powers, there really isn\u2019t anything they can do to \u201cfix\u201d this situation for her former friend. \n\nShe (presumably) can\u2019t just wave her magic wand and force the entire friend group to forget seeing her get forced to put her service dog outside shortly before suffering a serious injury that her service dog could have prevented. \n\nThe former friend deliberately deprived OP of medical aid, and OP was publicly sent to the hospital because of it. That\u2019s not something real friends do, and it\u2019s not something real friends forget seeing done to their friends.", "I have to commend your willingness to compromise that you'd risk getting hurt.", " SUFFER A MEDICAL INCIDENT.", "Nag, toxic people will always be toxic. If I told my parents someone did something unfair (so indeed telling lies), they would maybe support me, but they would not send multiple messages to that person and harass them like that. If they felt it was big enough to contact that other person, they would at least hear them out too.", "Exactly this. Her telling you the dog needs to be outside is like if she told someone they couldn't come inside her house with their glasses, or their prosthetic leg, or their wheelchair.", "Right\u203d We had a service dog accidentally have diarrhea on the floor at my work, and we were like \"No, it's no problem, we know you need him, I'm sure this isn't how things normally go, it's no trouble\" as we cleaned up. These animals are there to save lives. (This particular fella was there to help with an invisible disability too, though I can't recall which one. He was retiring the very next day.)", "You\u2019re so right.  If \u201cAnna\u201d had any humanity then watching the seizure would have been a come to Jesus moment from her. She would feel terrible about what happened and beg for forgiveness. Instead she has compounded her abusive behavior by adding her Mom and sister. Disgusting. \nI encourage the OP to tell their friend group what is happening so that they can help protect her.  \nNTA", "I haven\u2019t been replying to them anymore.", "It's similar to telling a diabetic to bring insulin with them, NTA.", "You\u2019re good people, not everyone would be so understanding.  :)", "That's right, I forgot she'd said op was pretending it to be more serious than it was. While it was happening.", "what\u2019s a come to Jesus moment? i can kind of guess, but what does it actually mean?", "It means a wake-up call/a sign you need to change, drastically, now.", "Ah right, thank you", "Attach a link of a video or medical article on the severity of seizures too. I doubt anything will get through to her after literally witnessing a medical event and thinking you faked it.. but who knows. I hope you are feeling better x", "That sounds great!"]}
