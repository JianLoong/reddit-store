My sister (45) and I co-own a house together. It was a duplex but we ripped out the wall in the living room years ago so now it's one big house. She has 2 girls. My wife and I have 2 boys and one on the way. It's a giant house. There's still 3 extra bedrooms left over. \n\nMy sister recently has been pretty much coning my wife in to taking her daughters with her everywhere. She does this every so often, honestly. She takes \"needing a break\" to the extreme and it's always when the warm weather hits (because my sister is really overweight, gets overheated and can't handle her children during these times- no offense to my sister). So anyways, she's been asking my wife pretty much daily to take the girls with her every single place she goes. My wife ends up feeling cornered (doesn't like confrontation) and just gives in. And what really pissed me off was that this even bled in to my children's first ever concert. We got tickets well in advance and unfortunately, I ended up breaking my hip and couldn't go so there was a ticket left over. I was destroyed over not being able to go (I was in the hospital) but my wife decided to still bring the boys and she calls when they got there and I find out that my sister basically told my wife how unfair it was that there was an extra ticket that her oldest daughter could use and she didn't even ask to bring her. Needless to say, the kid ended up being taken to the concert and by the time my wife got to the concert and called me, she was crying and completely overwhelmed and didn't even enjoy herself (my niece has ADHD and is one hell of a handful so there was no relaxing). \n\nI got home 2 days ago and went up one side of my sister and down the other. Told her that she had to talk our kids this weekend so my wife could go and relax after being conned in to parenting 2 extra kids for so long and not getting a single stroke of a second to herself. My sister was pissed, saying my wife \"could have just said no\", but my sister never takes no for an answer so this response was truly manipulative. In turn, I told her I'm selling my portion of the house (which means she would have to sell or convert back to duplex, which they don't have the money for) because I don't want to be around her bullshit anymore. She's been begging and crying to us for 2 days, trying to take our kids and kissing our ass but I have to stick to this because I don't trust her (this home has been in our family for 6-8 generations so my sister doesn't want to sell). AITA?\n\nETA: while I can appreciate people saying that this is an open ended threat on my end and that I would be responsible for the cost of converting back to a duplex, please understand that I've already spoken to a few lawyers about this (I thought the same thing) and no, its not on me financially to do this because of how the co-ownership deed is written. I'm not sure the in-depth legalities but I did speak on behalf of this issue profusely because I too thought it would be my obligation to rebuild the duplex with my intention to sell.

Even if your sister were to correct her behavior, this isn't doable long term. \n\nIs one option for your sister to buy you out with a mortgage, fix the wall and rent out the other side?

I'm not sure it would be possible for you to gain the boundaries needed while sharing a home, and from your write-up it is clear your sister is manipulative and unreasonably demanding.  \nHowever I'm not sure it is practical or if there is even a mechanism for you to sell your portion.

You need to put your family first, and your sister sounds like a manipulative nightmare. If that means moving into your own house, then that\u2019s what you need to do.

I hope the shock of having to move is the kickstart the sister needs to get her own life into some better semblance of order, and I hope that OP, wife, and children can really enjoy a family home that's JUST their family.", "NTA.

That's not healthy for her.\n\nSecondly, you are under no obligation to keep ownership of your half of the house. There's no reason why you and your family should have to constantly deal with your sister infringing on your family's activities or time.", "Nta she can buy you out.

Sure, but that's the consequence of her shitty choices.", "She has a husband and is still bullying your sister to take the kids?

My wife is pregnant and doesn't want the added stress for her or to have the kids around it. That and both my wife and I come from abusive backgrounds. Finding a backbone after years of abuse is difficult. We are in therapy and trying to better ourselves but I'm not rushing her progress.", "Me going through with the sale would push my sister out of the house or she would have to build up the dividing wall again.

I've already spoken with lawyers to start the process.", "That's not an option. I'm selling.", "From my understanding my sister didn't take the proper measures to convert to a duplex to begin with (I was 16 when the wall was ripped out). So I'm unsure how that will affect things long term either. I haven't gotten that in depth with the lawyers.", "Sister is super entitled. The wall wouldn't have even slowed her down. She'd have just dumped on OP and his family.", "NEITHER ONE OF THEM WORKS and they're foisting their childcare responsibilities on your wife?

Ok. Well you are definitely right to be free of this tyrant.", "That makes it sound like the structure is still titled as a duplex, which makes what you did very legally questionable.\n\nSeriously, put yourselves in the shoes of the buyer. Why would you buy a house with such a fucked up situation over a house with no fucked up situation? A house with that requires rebuilding walls and couldn't be lived in for months vs a house that doesn't have this problem?\n\nUnless you have some kind of paper trail, evidence, like a contract that specifically says your sister has to rebuild the wall in case of selling, she doesn't have to pay anything.  YOU DO!  The buyer has every right to demand that the wall is rebuilt and as you are the seller it comes out of your pocket.  Not hers.\n\nThe best you can do is to rebuild the walls now before getting it on the market. Maybe your sister will help pay for it.", "It's going to be extremely difficult to force your sister to pay to rebuild the wall, and it's extremely unlikely anyone will buy the property without the wall being in place.

Is there a reason that you own 75% while your much older sibling only owns 25%?", "Correct, except the percentages. I would take 75%, as I own 3/4 of the property (my sister got 3/4 of the business, my dad's idea of keeping things fair, but she sold that years ago and never gave me my portion).", "Just for me to learn. Why would it be up to her to pay if you are who wants to sell?", "Welcome to AITA lol. 90% of the comments are people just making stuff up, so be prepared", "Not trying to talk you out of it, just curious.  Could you rent out your part of the house to have some added income?", "You and your wife need to learn to say no and set a boundary.\n\nIt sounds like selling the house is a separate issue that you are using to get back at your sister instead of dealing with the core problem. \n\nIt\u2019s kinda a jerk move but NTA", "why did you post?", "It's like opening Pandora's Box especially if the work was done without permits and if it was a legally non-conforming use. You may be able to do a little legwork on your own. Most zoning codes are on-line and the building records are public. All you have to do is ask the building department for the building permits on file for the property.", "Oh wow, she really can't handle any responsibility, can she? That's unreal. I don't blame you for wanting out.", "Well, they do get food stamps so they don't eat our food but they do ask for gas money sometimes.", "Good news!\n\n> Legally, I am not obligated to cover that cost. She is. I've already spoken to a lawyer about it. I thought the same.", "It was my sister's idea. When the house was turned over to us, I was only 16 and didn't have any say in it. I personally wanted to keep the wall because I wanted my own space, whereas my sister was very much so an individual who didn't think I needed that much room to myself and eventually took over the whole house (until I met my wife and had kids- in which case she reluctantly gave me half of my 3/4 ownership). \n\nThe reason I own more of the house is because my sister inherited more of the business than I did, due to my age. My dad's way of \"keeping shit fair\". She sold the business soon after she acquired it and I never got my portion from that because she already had a kid and \"needed it more than me\". There's proof of that as well, which I've brought to a lawyer and apparently there's no statue of limitations on it.", "I'm actually not sure. They said something about how the deed is written up. Like I own 3/4 of the house and she pays no bills to be here and is apparently considered a squatter by law because she hasn't paid a bill since being here (her and her husband don't work). So the way they explained it to me is that where she didn't hold up her end of the deed arrangement, I'm under no obligation to financially contribute to fixing the wall to rebuild the duplex. They used different wordage but that's what I gathered from it.", "I probably could if it was converted back to the duplex but I'm actually kind of against taking that route, just because it would subject some poor renter to my sister's bogus. My sister's side of the property is utterly destroyed (like borderline hoarder- including outside). So finding someone willing to rent would be pretty difficult, I would imagine.", "To ask if I was an AH for selling. And I've accepted all judgement. This commenter told me to solve the issue without selling so I said no. I didn't post to have people try to talk me out of it.", "Omg! That\u2019s awful.", "So if you own 3/4's of the house, can  you get the place appraised and offer her 1/4 of the appraised price?\n\nI now see why you want to be  away from her.  Her whole demeanor is entitled laziness.  \n\nTalk with the lawyer again, is the extra 1/4 ownership enough to compensate for the % of the business that you didn't receive?  Maybe you are entitled to an even higher % of ownership.\n\nSo, the way I see it, whether you re-finance  to buy her 1/4 share or you are forced to sell, she has to move out.  Ask her to choose her poison. \n\nShe is definitely one of those family members that one would go LC and NC.  Sorry that you find yourself having to share space with her.\n\nI feel ya.\n\nGet a lawyer's advice on what forcing a sale entails.", "dude, if that's the case - lawyer up and try to see if you can't get the value owed you from the business sale in the form of her 1/4 remaining ownership of the house.\n\nthen you can boot your mooching sister and her family, keep your home in your family, and you can all de-stress.", "If both her and her husband don\u2019t work, then where the freaking hell is he when she needs a \u201cbreak\u201d?", "So, if they are legally squatters, can you evict them or request some way that she be removed from the deed?", "[removed]", "This makes no sense. If she owns 1/4 of the house, she's not a squatter. She's an owner. Do you have some sort of documentation that lays out how utilities/maintenance will be handled?", "Oh he's basically useless. Guy sits at a computer all day playing Sims4 and tells my sister all the time that if anything happens to her he isn't taking the girls. I've been telling her to leave his sorry ass for years but it's always the \"we are highschool sweethearts, I love him\" talk.", "Both me and my wife come from very abusive backgrounds.

Did she really believe it wouldn't come back to bite her in the ass.", "NTA but I would have left it a duplex.", "It\u2019s not a threat it\u2019s a promise. You told her some boundaries/returning favor she didn\u2019t want to do. you are removing yourself from the problem and starting on your own", "Of course she's crying and kissing your ass now. She doesn't want to lose her free maid.   \nWhat a person. You're NTA for showing her what's what for a change. Since your sister is useless, maybe you could take care of the kids so your wife gets to be without them for a day?", "Nta, if you and sister own outright she can get a loan and buy you out.", "NTA", "ESH.  And whatever your lawyer tells you about the legalities of your sales plan, there is the practical reality of finding a buyer willing to take on a duplex with a missing wall between your side and the family living in the other side good luck with that.", "You are not the ass.  People like your sister don't understand boundaries and won't change unless you stick with your boundaries.", "She owes you 12 years of rent for the 1/4 of a house that's yours but she is using and her share of the bills.  Tbh, I'd just force the sale and let the family house be a memory you'd sooner forget... or offer to buy her out and get her and her parasites out of your life.", "Assuming the cost is on the person who isn't selling, you should be scared that your threat may entice you sis to go through with selling first to force the cost back on to you", "Nta she can buy you out. Or sell the whole thing and split the profit.", "Do you think the wall would stop the sister who lives next door?", "This. Can\u2019t say it any better lmao", "NTA, but I get the feeling that this BS would be happening if there was a wall there.", "I don't either, but at least it would give them separate space sometimes, and allow for either party to sell much easier. I can't imagine un-duplexing a duplex, and he must have had an idea of how his sister is beforehand.\n\nEdit: saw his comment, it was done before he had any control over it (he was 16). The person who decided to do it was...his sister.", "NTA", "So where is the husband in this? Why is t he looking after his children when his wife is shirking her responsibilities?", "Then why isn't her husband helping with their kids? Really this is a horrible situation. I am sorry OP that your sister and BIL suck as housemates.", "All this time I thought it was Gorbachev at the behest of Reagan", "Thanks for the explanation. Who is responsible for the legal cost to get the writ approved by a court?", "It is an empty threat.  Your house is a permitting nightmare that no realtor or reputable buyer would touch with a 10ft pole.  I don't practice real estate law, but I do know enough in that area to know that it will be unreasonably expensive to get out of the mess you made. \n\nSelling a house with an existing tenant is a nightmare.  You've got a partial owner in there. Those attorneys you've talked to are about to go buy a vacation house that you're paying for.", "**NTA**", "Or that the sister doesn't gain any more weight.", "How does a person get large on food stamps? Is everyone else in her family going hungry?", "But wouldn't the poster still have to go to court to actually force the sister to rebuild it? It's not like she'd be willing to do it herself just because it's her legal burden. \n\nI think this is going to be a very long and expensive legal process or end up with the poster giving in and building it himself. Maybe he could get his damages paid for in the end, but I can't see it happening easily.", "Yep! I always look at it like they thought you'd attract karma either through funniness or insight lol"]}
