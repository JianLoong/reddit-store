My sister (45) and I co-own a house together. It was a duplex but we ripped out the wall in the living room years ago so now it's one big house. She has 2 girls. My wife and I have 2 boys and one on the way. It's a giant house. There's still 3 extra bedrooms left over. \n\nMy sister recently has been pretty much coning my wife in to taking her daughters with her everywhere. She does this every so often, honestly. She takes \"needing a break\" to the extreme and it's always when the warm weather hits (because my sister is really overweight, gets overheated and can't handle her children during these times- no offense to my sister). So anyways, she's been asking my wife pretty much daily to take the girls with her every single place she goes. My wife ends up feeling cornered (doesn't like confrontation) and just gives in. And what really pissed me off was that this even bled in to my children's first ever concert. We got tickets well in advance and unfortunately, I ended up breaking my hip and couldn't go so there was a ticket left over. I was destroyed over not being able to go (I was in the hospital) but my wife decided to still bring the boys and she calls when they got there and I find out that my sister basically told my wife how unfair it was that there was an extra ticket that her oldest daughter could use and she didn't even ask to bring her. Needless to say, the kid ended up being taken to the concert and by the time my wife got to the concert and called me, she was crying and completely overwhelmed and didn't even enjoy herself (my niece has ADHD and is one hell of a handful so there was no relaxing). \n\nI got home 2 days ago and went up one side of my sister and down the other. Told her that she had to talk our kids this weekend so my wife could go and relax after being conned in to parenting 2 extra kids for so long and not getting a single stroke of a second to herself. My sister was pissed, saying my wife \"could have just said no\", but my sister never takes no for an answer so this response was truly manipulative. In turn, I told her I'm selling my portion of the house (which means she would have to sell or convert back to duplex, which they don't have the money for) because I don't want to be around her bullshit anymore. She's been begging and crying to us for 2 days, trying to take our kids and kissing our ass but I have to stick to this because I don't trust her (this home has been in our family for 6-8 generations so my sister doesn't want to sell). AITA?\n\nETA: while I can appreciate people saying that this is an open ended threat on my end and that I would be responsible for the cost of converting back to a duplex, please understand that I've already spoken to a few lawyers about this (I thought the same thing) and no, its not on me financially to do this because of how the co-ownership deed is written. I'm not sure the in-depth legalities but I did speak on behalf of this issue profusely because I too thought it would be my obligation to rebuild the duplex with my intention to sell. But legally it is not on me, for whatever reason.", "created_utc": 1685467839, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13vwi8h/aita_for_selling_my_portion_of_the_house_because/", "score": 116, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What your sister has been doing to your wife is pretty scummy. I'm honestly surprised that you let it get to the point where you were so fed up you decided to sell the house though.  Either way, she needs to take responsibility for her own children and not have the ability to corner your wife into doing it for her.", "NTA. You are all insane people for tearing down that wall in the first place lol.", "NTA. Families need their space and these co-living arrangements rarely work out.  Even if your sister were to correct her behavior, this isn't doable long term. \n\nIs one option for your sister to buy you out with a mortgage, fix the wall and rent out the other side? That way, she would only have half a mortgage, some rental income to offset it, wouldn't have to move, and the \"family duplex\" could stay in the family.", "NTA-\nYou can give her or other family options to buy your half, or convert it back and just stop with taking care of her kids.", "NTA. Put the wall back up.", "So your desire is to move elsewhere so that you aren't in such close proximity to your sister? For that, NTA. I'm not sure it would be possible for you to gain the boundaries needed while sharing a home, and from your write-up it is clear your sister is manipulative and unreasonably demanding.  \nHowever I'm not sure it is practical or if there is even a mechanism for you to sell your portion. It might be more practical for you to a) convert back to a divided duplex, and b) learn to say no - don't let yourselves be forced, coerced, or guilted into doing ANYTHING for your sister.", "NTA. You need to put your family first, and your sister sounds like a manipulative nightmare. If that means moving into your own house, then that\u2019s what you need to do. While I think it would have been better to have multiple conversations and discussions about childcare arrangement and how to communicate with one another, rather than simply dropping this on her with no notice, you need to do what it takes to keep your own family happy and healthy.", "Between the main story, and some of OP's comments, I can't conclude anything but NTA. His sister hasn't really done any one little thing, she's just pushed and taken so much over the years that OP is finally at the point of realising that no, this is not fair, this is not reasonable, and this is not how he wants to live with his wife and family.\n\nIf the sister inherited 3/4 of a family business (which is why OP owns 3/4 of the house), sold it, and has managed to fritter away that money (quite possibly including the 1/4 share which OP would have been due), it'd be a terrible financial choice to stay put, because he will *forever* be having to pick up the pieces.\n\nNTA. I hope the shock of having to move is the kickstart the sister needs to get her own life into some better semblance of order, and I hope that OP, wife, and children can really enjoy a family home that's JUST their family.", "NTA. Build the wall, build the wall !!!", "NTA, but you and your wife created this by tearing the wall down & your wife's inability to say \"HELL NO\".", "If I understand correctly, your sister lives in this house and would NOT be required to move if you sold your share.\n\nWhy would anyone buy your half of this house?  Who the hell would want to buy a \"house\" that they have to share with someone they don't know and not having any privacy?  You would have better luck buying your sister's share of the house.\n\nThis is stupid.", "ESH\n\nYou're going to sell (half of) a home that's been in your family for generations instead of just laying out healthy boundaries? \n\nAre there two separate deeds to this house? I don't really understand how you'd sell half of the house if you are both full and equal owners.", "[deleted]", "FYI, you can't just sell half of a house and you can't force a co-owner to sell either.

Kuddos to you for having your wife's back. Don't you go back on your word. Sell your half and move ao your wife doesn't have to parent other people's children on top of your children", "NTA.\n\nFirst of all, your wife should consider some counseling to try to learn some techniques/tools to overcome her inability to stand up for herself. That's not healthy for her.\n\nSecondly, you are under no obligation to keep ownership of your half of the house. There's no reason why you and your family should have to constantly deal with your sister infringing on your family's activities or time.", "Nta she can buy you out. Or sell the whole thing and split the profit.\n\n\n If you back down then she's just going to keep doing it.  Does it suck?  Sure, but that's the consequence of her shitty choices.", "She has a husband and is still bullying your sister to take the kids? Build emotional walls since the real ones are gone. \n\nSell soon but do keep talking to real estate lawyers though. It's better to handle that part now rather than 15 years down the line. I hope your wife is doing better now.", "NTA\n\nYour sister has two kids and you have three soon. That means five parties that claim partial ownership of the house in the next generation.\n\nSell and find your family a cosy new home.", "Also, if the home has been in the family for generations, the former duplex may not meet the zoning codes for lots size and zone. Legally non-conforming uses are permitted unless they have been \"abandoned\" for a year in most jurisdictions. It's standard language in local zoning codes. So it may not be possible to convert if from a one family back to a duplex.", ">You are all insane people for tearing down that wall in the first place lol\n\nExactly.  Good walls make good neighbors.\n\nNTA", "I don\u2019t think a wall would stop that sister.", "Op was only 16 when the wall was taken down", "I did give her that option but her credit is poor and neither her nor her husband work so they have no income or the means to get a loan to buy me out.", "Never thought I\u2019d support building a wall, yet here I am\u2026", "MY BAD I THOUGHT NOBODY WENT THERE THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE", "OP didn't tear down the wall. The sister did when OP was a minor.", "If you knew my sister you would understand how much of a down right brawl it would turn in to if my wife said no. Everything is a fight with her. My wife is pregnant and doesn't want the added stress for her or to have the kids around it. That and both my wife and I come from abusive backgrounds. Finding a backbone after years of abuse is difficult. We are in therapy and trying to better ourselves but I'm not rushing her progress.", "Me going through with the sale would push my sister out of the house or she would have to build up the dividing wall again. There wouldn't be a chance of anyone buying just my portion without throwing my sister out. That's kind of a weird way of looking at it, as that was never mentioned of being an option.", "Thats not how it works. If you own a stake and wish tp sell the other person can buy you out pr bpth are forced to sell.", "The way the deed was written out, I own 3/4 of the house and all the bills are in my name (my sister and her husband don't work and haven't for years). I have no sentimental ties to the house and have no problem selling. My sister, who put our abusive father on a pedestal, has emotional ties to it.", "Nope. OP can force a sale of the entire house. Sis gets 50%, OP gets 50%.", "Of course you can force a co-owner to sell. Ever here of divorce?", "Legally, I am not obligated to cover that cost. She is. I've already spoken to a lawyer about it. I thought the same.", "Incorrect.", "I am selling. That's not an empty threat. Bold of you to accuse a complete stranger of not holding firm to their word. I've already spoken with lawyers to start the process.", "That's not an option. I'm selling.", "From my understanding my sister didn't take the proper measures to convert to a duplex to begin with (I was 16 when the wall was ripped out). So I'm unsure how that will affect things long term either. I haven't gotten that in depth with the lawyers.", "Sister is super entitled. The wall wouldn't have even slowed her down. She'd have just dumped on OP and his family.", "NEITHER ONE OF THEM WORKS and they're foisting their childcare responsibilities on your wife? Let me guess, they also always end up eating your food, having you drive because their car doesn't work or is low on gas, etc.? \n\nAt this point, how can you afford not to sell and be rid of them?", "Ohhhhh. Ok. Well you are definitely right to be free of this tyrant.", "That makes it sound like the structure is still titled as a duplex, which makes what you did very legally questionable.\n\nSeriously, put yourselves in the shoes of the buyer. Why would you buy a house with such a fucked up situation over a house with no fucked up situation? A house with that requires rebuilding walls and couldn't be lived in for months vs a house that doesn't have this problem?\n\nUnless you have some kind of paper trail, evidence, like a contract that specifically says your sister has to rebuild the wall in case of selling, she doesn't have to pay anything.  YOU DO!  The buyer has every right to demand that the wall is rebuilt and as you are the seller it comes out of your pocket.  Not hers.\n\nThe best you can do is to rebuild the walls now before getting it on the market. Maybe your sister will help pay for it.", "It's going to be extremely difficult to force your sister to pay to rebuild the wall, and it's extremely unlikely anyone will buy the property without the wall being in place. I think you really need to do some research as to the feasibility of your plan and/or be prepared to rebuild the walls yourself before putting the house on the market.", "Unless another family member is willing to step up and buy you out.", "Why did you tear out the wall in the first place? Is there a reason that you own 75% while your much older sibling only owns 25%?", "Correct, except the percentages. I would take 75%, as I own 3/4 of the property (my sister got 3/4 of the business, my dad's idea of keeping things fair, but she sold that years ago and never gave me my portion).", "Just for me to learn. Why would it be up to her to pay if you are who wants to sell?", "Welcome to AITA lol. 90% of the comments are people just making stuff up, so be prepared", "Not trying to talk you out of it, just curious.  Could you rent out your part of the house to have some added income?", "You and your wife need to learn to say no and set a boundary.\n\nIt sounds like selling the house is a separate issue that you are using to get back at your sister instead of dealing with the core problem. \n\nIt\u2019s kinda a jerk move but NTA", "why did you post?", "It's like opening Pandora's Box especially if the work was done without permits and if it was a legally non-conforming use. You may be able to do a little legwork on your own. Most zoning codes are on-line and the building records are public. All you have to do is ask the building department for the building permits on file for the property.", "Oh wow, she really can't handle any responsibility, can she? That's unreal. I don't blame you for wanting out.", "Well, they do get food stamps so they don't eat our food but they do ask for gas money sometimes.", "Good news!\n\n> Legally, I am not obligated to cover that cost. She is. I've already spoken to a lawyer about it. I thought the same.", "It was my sister's idea. When the house was turned over to us, I was only 16 and didn't have any say in it. I personally wanted to keep the wall because I wanted my own space, whereas my sister was very much so an individual who didn't think I needed that much room to myself and eventually took over the whole house (until I met my wife and had kids- in which case she reluctantly gave me half of my 3/4 ownership). \n\nThe reason I own more of the house is because my sister inherited more of the business than I did, due to my age. My dad's way of \"keeping shit fair\". She sold the business soon after she acquired it and I never got my portion from that because she already had a kid and \"needed it more than me\". There's proof of that as well, which I've brought to a lawyer and apparently there's no statue of limitations on it.", "I'm actually not sure. They said something about how the deed is written up. Like I own 3/4 of the house and she pays no bills to be here and is apparently considered a squatter by law because she hasn't paid a bill since being here (her and her husband don't work). So the way they explained it to me is that where she didn't hold up her end of the deed arrangement, I'm under no obligation to financially contribute to fixing the wall to rebuild the duplex. They used different wordage but that's what I gathered from it.", "I probably could if it was converted back to the duplex but I'm actually kind of against taking that route, just because it would subject some poor renter to my sister's bogus. My sister's side of the property is utterly destroyed (like borderline hoarder- including outside). So finding someone willing to rent would be pretty difficult, I would imagine.", "To ask if I was an AH for selling. And I've accepted all judgement. This commenter told me to solve the issue without selling so I said no. I didn't post to have people try to talk me out of it.", "Omg! That\u2019s awful.", "So if you own 3/4's of the house, can  you get the place appraised and offer her 1/4 of the appraised price?\n\nI now see why you want to be  away from her.  Her whole demeanor is entitled laziness.  \n\nTalk with the lawyer again, is the extra 1/4 ownership enough to compensate for the % of the business that you didn't receive?  Maybe you are entitled to an even higher % of ownership.\n\nSo, the way I see it, whether you re-finance  to buy her 1/4 share or you are forced to sell, she has to move out.  Ask her to choose her poison. \n\nShe is definitely one of those family members that one would go LC and NC.  Sorry that you find yourself having to share space with her.\n\nI feel ya.\n\nGet a lawyer's advice on what forcing a sale entails.", "dude, if that's the case - lawyer up and try to see if you can't get the value owed you from the business sale in the form of her 1/4 remaining ownership of the house.\n\nthen you can boot your mooching sister and her family, keep your home in your family, and you can all de-stress.", "If both her and her husband don\u2019t work, then where the freaking hell is he when she needs a \u201cbreak\u201d?", "So, if they are legally squatters, can you evict them or request some way that she be removed from the deed?", "You and yoiur wife both sound like doormats.  You pay for them to live and take the kids whenever your wife is TOLD to?", "This makes no sense. If she owns 1/4 of the house, she's not a squatter. She's an owner. Do you have some sort of documentation that lays out how utilities/maintenance will be handled?", "Oh he's basically useless. Guy sits at a computer all day playing Sims4 and tells my sister all the time that if anything happens to her he isn't taking the girls. I've been telling her to leave his sorry ass for years but it's always the \"we are highschool sweethearts, I love him\" talk.", "Both me and my wife come from very abusive backgrounds. Unfortunately I'm just now growing a backbone where as my wife still has panic attacks at the mere thought of defending herself. We are both in therapy though so there's been progress, even if it's a little. This was a huge step for me and I'm hoping my wife will see it and it'll help her.", "Then the love of her live can get off his ass and take care of his kids."]}
