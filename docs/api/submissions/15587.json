My husband owns  a townhome complex that he rents out and we decided to let her live in one of them rent free, since she\u2019s in college and we want her to focus on that.  The only rule I had for her was to not allow her baby daddy( M23) move in. The guy is very much bad news and has a record and every time he comes into my sister\u2019s life he sets her back, Mentally and academically, and way more stuff.  \n\nMy husband drives past these homes everyday and he always sees my sister\u2019s baby daddy\u2019s car in the drive way. At first I thought he was just visiting or babysitting . But my husband left work at 11pm one night and he told me he seen the car still there. So my suspicion was he was staying there. I asked my sister first and she lied to me and said he\u2019s never there, which is a lie because his car is there daily.   \n\nMy sister went out town and this where I maybe wrong but I just needed to just see for myself, so I used the master key and went into the house and it\u2019s pretty clear he\u2019s living there. Almost all of his stuff was there. And I was honestly furious because that was the only rule I gave her and were loosing money by helping her. I waited for her to come home and I confronted her about it and of course it turned into a screaming match and she was mad I went into her home without permission. I told her she needs to start paying rent or I\u2019ll be evicting her.\n\nMy mom is on her side and said it was unnecessary that I went into her home when she wasn\u2019t there and that I would be an asshole if I start demanding rent or evict her since I was once her age and dated horrible dudes too.. so AITA?\n\nEdit: no she does not have a lease for the townhouse since she\u2019s not paying anything there. if she were to start paying rent she would be put on lease. The only thing that she pays for is cable and electricity. Everything else we pay for. the townhouse is under the ownership of husbands company.\n\nSecond edit: the argument that some of you guys are making that \u201cshe\u2019s a tenet\u201dand I broke rental agreement. I\u2019m gonna repeat myself she does not have a lease/ rental agreement . Technically the place is still my husbands. she hasn\u2019t paid any sort rent of towards the house, she never paid any security deposit, she legally just a person that stays on our property. The most rights she would potentially have is squatter rights other then that no. How do you guys think we have spare key to get in? if she was a traditional renter we wouldn\u2019t have access to a spare like that. Again my sister has no binding to the property it\u2019s in my husbands name. He is the sole owner of that property. Her ownership to the house is equivalent to someone staying at a hotel for free.", "created_utc": 1682359238, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12xqx5e/aita_for_going_into_my_sisters_house_without/", "score": 1483, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

So your mom's counter-argument doesn't hold any water - not that it would anyway - because you're not evicting your sister for dating a \"horrible dude\", you're doing it because she's moved in the horrible dude on YOUR dime after you were very clear that this was the one condition to her living there in the first place.\n\nYou had valid reason to suspect she wasn't abiding by that condition, and tried to ask her about it, but in return you were met with easily debunked lies.\n\nIf your mom is so upset, why doesn't she co-sign a real lease for the townhouse and put herself on the hook for your sister's rent?

Renters rights do not need a formal lease to prove residence. She pays cable and electric bill at the address so she has proof of residence there. \n\nYou need to speak to an attorney who has expertise in rentals/housing because you are going about this all wrong. You cannot threaten to evict her without taking the correct steps. Otherwise flash forward 6 months she will still be living there rent free and you will be working on a settlement to pay her cash to get her out if she decides to fight this. \n\nHonestly if your moving family into a property under your husbands company ownership you need a lease, even if its for 0$ per month, that defines what the expectations are... ie no overnight visitors or ex bf to stay over etc etc. Be very clear that the \"help\" you are offering comes with many strings attached.", "Functionally speaking, you are her landlord and you owe her 24 hours notice... That means, I guess, that you don't need her *permission* but you do need to give her advance notice.\n\nHowever, you are providing her with an *incredible boon* here in giving her rent free place to live on basically one, single requirement.\n\nSo what we have here is that she is TA for breaking that rule. And you would be entirely within your rights to evict her, demand rent, or whatever, and not be TA for it.\n\nBut you nevertheless are TA for going into her house without 24 hour notice. If she wanted to be *majorly* retributive, she would be able to get y'all in trouble for that, and as you have a whole complex, that could be a prolem for you and your husband. I doubt that waiting 24 hours after you told her would have prevented you from finding out, so you really should have made sure to toe the letter of the law there.\n\nSo in the end, ESH, but feel heartened by the fact that she is majorly so for violating your trust and charity, and you only are for a minor technicality, for not following the legally proscribed way to catch her doing so (and to be honest, the only reason I put it in this frame is to emphasize that you are *in the right* but doing it *in this way* could get you in trouble! Don't!)", "Legally speaking, YTA. its actually illegal for a landlord to do what you did and even though you are letting her stay there rent free you are still her landlord. that being said as a landlord you are entitled to kick her out for having someone else living there that isn't part of the agreement. \n\nI question if that would be the right move though, you say whenever he is around it sets her back in all aspects of her life, but from what you said it doesn't seem like she's been set back at all and is still doing fine despite him living there, the only thing that tipped you off to him being around was seeing his car. its quite possible they are trying to work on things and co-parent in a non toxic way but felt like they couldn't tell you over the fear of her becoming homeless.\n\nI'd apologize for going in without her permission and try to talk it out with her and figure out what they are doing and why she didn't tell you, if it seems like they are maybe making a genuine effort, maybe give them a chance, if they fall back into old habits you have no responsibility to continue to enable it and can evict her then", "ESH\n\nIt may be yours/your husband\u2019s property legally, however, she\u2019s living there and it\u2019s her home, her personal space.

Do you really think she is going to say \"I'm so sorry\" and dump the guy?  More likely she lies again that she's dumping him but she keeps sneaking around? Or she tells you to stick it and moves into a slum somewhere with your nieces (or nephews) AND him? What will you have won? \n\nI'm not saying there shouldn't be consequences for her lying, but I think you need to find a reasonable solution and accept that her bf is probably going to be in her life for the time being at least.", "yta. also, since you're her landlord, it's HELLA illegal to just enter like that", "NTA.
