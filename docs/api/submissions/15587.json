Renters rights do not need a formal lease to prove residence. She pays cable and electric bill at the address so she has proof of residence there. \n\nYou need to speak to an attorney who has expertise in rentals/housing because you are going about this all wrong. You cannot threaten to evict her without taking the correct steps. Otherwise flash forward 6 months she will still be living there rent free and you will be working on a settlement to pay her cash to get her out if she decides to fight this. \n\nHonestly if your moving family into a property under your husbands company ownership you need a lease, even if its for 0$ per month, that defines what the expectations are... ie no overnight visitors or ex bf to stay over etc etc. Be very clear that the \"help\" you are offering comes with many strings attached.", "Functionally speaking, you are her landlord and you owe her 24 hours notice... That means, I guess, that you don't need her *permission* but you do need to give her advance notice.\n\nHowever, you are providing her with an *incredible boon* here in giving her rent free place to live on basically one, single requirement.\n\nSo what we have here is that she is TA for breaking that rule. And you would be entirely within your rights to evict her, demand rent, or whatever, and not be TA for it.\n\nBut you nevertheless are TA for going into her house without 24 hour notice. If she wanted to be *majorly* retributive, she would be able to get y'all in trouble for that, and as you have a whole complex, that could be a prolem for you and your husband. I doubt that waiting 24 hours after you told her would have prevented you from finding out, so you really should have made sure to toe the letter of the law there.\n\nSo in the end, ESH, but feel heartened by the fact that she is majorly so for violating your trust and charity, and you only are for a minor technicality, for not following the legally proscribed way to catch her doing so (and to be honest, the only reason I put it in this frame is to emphasize that you are *in the right* but doing it *in this way* could get you in trouble! Don't!)", "Legally speaking, YTA. its actually illegal for a landlord to do what you did and even though you are letting her stay there rent free you are still her landlord. that being said as a landlord you are entitled to kick her out for having someone else living there that isn't part of the agreement. \n\nI question if that would be the right move though, you say whenever he is around it sets her back in all aspects of her life, but from what you said it doesn't seem like she's been set back at all and is still doing fine despite him living there, the only thing that tipped you off to him being around was seeing his car. its quite possible they are trying to work on things and co-parent in a non toxic way but felt like they couldn't tell you over the fear of her becoming homeless.\n\nI'd apologize for going in without her permission and try to talk it out with her and figure out what they are doing and why she didn't tell you, if it seems like they are maybe making a genuine effort, maybe give them a chance, if they fall back into old habits you have no responsibility to continue to enable it and can evict her then", "ESH\n\nIt may be yours/your husband\u2019s property legally, however, she\u2019s living there and it\u2019s her home, her personal space.

Do you really think she is going to say \"I'm so sorry\" and dump the guy?  More likely she lies again that she's dumping him but she keeps sneaking around? Or she tells you to stick it and moves into a slum somewhere with your nieces (or nephews) AND him? What will you have won? \n\nI'm not saying there shouldn't be consequences for her lying, but I think you need to find a reasonable solution and accept that her bf is probably going to be in her life for the time being at least.", "yta. also, since you're her landlord, it's HELLA illegal to just enter like that", "NTA. Throw the tart out", "YTA. You knew the guy was over there and you could have told her she needed to leave. There was no reason to go in without her permission, and even wait until she left.

It does depend on jurisdiction, though.", "Well, that's good.", "Apparently in 37 states in the US these rights exist according to law, so the fact that the lease is based on a verbal agreement shouldn't come into play.

She has the right to evict and she should.", "This isn't Am I Legally Right? Yes, OP didn't act legally. That's not the question being asked.\n\nBut were they an asshole? No. They didn't intrude into their sister's privacy for fun, but because they suspected their sister was lying to them about the one fundamental boundary they'd set for helping her. And they didn't intrude on her privacy any further than needed to find out that information.", "And now the sister has established it\u2019s gone beyond family helping family.

This 23 year already has a record and either was in highschool while he could drink or he was dating an 18 year old who was still in highschool at time 19 year old gets pregnant.\n\nAt best, I imagine her family/OP tried there damnest to stop/dissuade this interaction. Didn't work. Kids, twins. \n\nWhat does family do? Stick this teenager in a home by herself with the twins. Sounds like a good idea but its BAD idea.  She needed support in the home. Its not unpredictable that regardless if she wanted to put this guy in her past, she 1) has to let him visit his kids and 2) he is going to be well-aware that she needs help with kids and life in general. Shes still learning and by giving her this house, you actually created perfect situation for Baby Daddy. All he needed to do was be more coy with parking and does OP/Family ever know? How easy would it be for him to park a couple blocks away and keep his stuff in a box that could be hidden? Its only cause he makes dumb decisions that the situation is ever realized even though its a situation that should have been realized immediately.\n\nSo what do we do now? Forcing her to go to work is only going to push her FURTHER to him. Thats why I say its the wrong way. If we want to set her up for success and break the hold this guy has on her, she needs positive not negative reinforcement from her family. \n\nMake more sense? \n\nIts not about turning other check its about being tactical toward getting the solution/behavior we want.", "Sure. My point is sister is \"wayward\" has two little kids and is in a relationship with someone whom I would call a predator if I'm being honest. Ops action make sister need the predator more.", "You absolutely don't need a lease to be a tenant. I don't *believe* you need to even be paying money to be, legally, a tenant, but that might vary by jurisdiction *(I suspect the fact she pays utilities will help a great deal if she needed to establish that she has legal tenancy though*). In any case though, OP and her husband don't just own one property. It is stated they own a townhome *complex,* so they absolutely do *not* want to risk doing anything illegal here and have a mark against them in the courts. Not to mention most laws will hold landlords to a higher standard if they own above a certain number of properties, so they really don't want to risk anything here as the penalry would certainly be worse then sneaking in on the sister at ones beach house you weren't using for the summer.\n\nEven if her legal status as a tenant is up in the air, absolutely err on the side of caution. Whether she went in today, or went in 24 hours from today, she would have caught them (either find the stuff still there, or catch them trying to remove it after being told), so it was entirely unnecessary to do it this way.", "The sister is in a free house with one rule. Like come on, the sister made OP come up with the ultimatum. It\u2019s a FREE townhome. She chose baby daddy which is fine, but now you\u2019re getting treated like any other tenant.", "Nope, don\u2019t give legal advice when you don\u2019t know the situation.", "most places in the US landlords have to give a minimum of 24 hours before entering.", "Not in the eyes of the law (in most places).

Do not take legal advice from this person.", "Thanks for your considered legal opinion. Where did you go to school?", "That's the thing... legally, she is not a guest anymore. It's her residence. So regular tenants laws applies to her.", "> She doesn't have a lease\n\nThen you are fucked. You have no easy clean way to get her out.\n\n>she, specifically, was told Baby Daddy CAN'T live there.\n\nYes, you said. But without that in writing, I repeat: you are fucked.  \n\nIs she taking the piss? Yes. Has she broken  your agreement? Also yes. Is she making a huge self-destructive mess of her life? Apparently so. Can you do anything about it? Not easily. Not without a laywer and a court order and a lot of expense. \n\nI realise it is hell to watch someone you love fuck up their life, but that's the reality of your position here. You're going to have to either back off and let it play out and hope she comes to her senses, or go nuclear with a court order to get her out.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, depending on your local laws, she has almost certainly established some kind of tenancy or right to reside, which means (again depending on local laws) you are almost certainly breaking the law by letting yourself in.\n\n\nSorry. The whole horrible mess sucks. \"No good deed goes un-punished\" right?", "Not having a lease or rental agreement puts at worse as a squatter and at best a guest.\n\nNeither of which preclude op from entering her own property  whenever she pleases.\n\nIt would be like you had a pool house out back and you let someone stay the summer but can't have people over.\n\nThat does not become their home as the terms of occupancy has a restricted time frame and other such restrictions.\n\nOP is letting sister stay basically in her guest house.", "Right, by following the LAW, not \u2018your house your rules\u2019.", "Sister isn't a tenant \n\nAt best she is a guest and at worst a squatter", "Is thar illegal where OP lives?

Those are boundaries they can set.  \n\n\nThey're not \"forcing her to work\", there was a choice, a boundary she chose to ignore.  Society is \"forcing her to work\", ending or reducing your charity to someone isn't FORCING anything.  It's ending something.

It wasn't even \"he can't come over\", just \"he can't live there\", she could have had him help all she wanted without moving his shit in.  \n\n\nHonestly, I read your response and it boils down to \"reward liars and cheats, the people who take advantage of you are the ones that need more from you\" and I just can't with that.", "Wayward sis was going to predator regardless.\n\nThis way op can either get paid and none of her business or wayward can move out and op can get paid", "Makes sense.

The specific legal details probably depend a lot of where they live, but there's a very good chance that both the sister and her bf would count as tenants.\n\nETA: Sister also pays cable and electricity.
