I was talking to one of the archeologists one day during our lunch break and he asked those kinds of \u2018getting to know you\u2019 questions you ask young people: Do you play sports? What\u2019s your favorite subject? And I told him, no I don\u2019t play any sports. I do theater, I\u2019m in choir, I play the violin and piano, I used to take art classes.\n\n\"And he went wow. That\u2019s amazing! And I said, \u2018Oh no, but I\u2019m not any good at any of them.\u2019\n\n\"And he said something then that I will never forget and which absolutely blew my mind because no one had ever said anything like it to me before: \u2018I don\u2019t think being good at things is the point of doing them. I think you\u2019ve got all these wonderful experiences with different skills, and that all teaches you things and makes you an interesting person, no matter how well you do them.\u2019\n\n\"And that honestly changed my life. Because I went from a failure, someone who hadn\u2019t been talented enough at anything to excel, to someone who did things because I enjoyed them. I had been raised in such an achievement-oriented environment, so inundated with the myth of Talent, that I thought it was only worth doing things if you could \u2018win\u2019 at them.\"\n\n-- Kurt Vonnegut\n\nhttps://medium.com/writers-blokke/a-life-lesson-from-kurt-vonnegut-of-all-people-4cbd3284c740\n\nYTA for cutting down your friend.", "If making a couple OCs makes you an author, consider me Stephen King.\n\nAnyway, I'm not sure why any of this matters.

I get you\u2019re annoyed at her for bringing up the same thing but why don\u2019t you address that rather than belittle her dreams?", "NTA, mostly. \n\nYou probably could have worded what you said more gently. It's true that your friend isn't an author if she hasn't written anything. But there are nicer ways to address the issue than to essentially call her a failure. \n\nMostly I think this is a communication failure on both parties. Your friend isn't recognizing that she is monopolizing conversations and co-opting terms that aren't correct for her current situation, and you failed to address your frustrations proactively before it got too much and you snapped at her.", "YTA but only kind of... I don't think your friend could be considered an author either, but I think calling her out on that when it's something she seems to be passionate about, especially in front of others, is wrong. However, I'm sure she must've been pretty annoying, but you should've called her out on always trying to dominate the conversation rather than not qualifying as an author.", "NTA.\n\nShe is a writer, but not an author. A writer is any person who writes and enjoys writing (even just blurbs or character write ups). An author is a published professional whose skills have a marketable application. This is just my personal definition of course, but everyone has their own way of interpreting these things.\n\nThat said, there's nothing more annoying than the person who won't shut up about writing but never writes. She needs to read the room. Writing is a hobby/career but not a personality trait. Writers are people who HAVE personality traits.", "NTA.

An author is someone whom has their work published, regardless if it was done by professional means or not. A writer, on the other hand, is someone who writes anything that's a story, article, etc; they don't have to publish anything to be considered a writer.

The three characters she made are really fleshed out and her idea for her story is good and expanded on,\n\nJust getting to this point already involves a good amount of writing. Some authors can sit down and birth an entire novel. Most don't -- they start by writing down their idea, plot summary, character sketches, world building if you're doing speculative fiction... It's an enormous amount of work before you even begin to write Chapter 1.  But it's definitely writing, and it's part of the process, just like scales and etudes are to a musician.\n\nI've done NaNoWriMo and have put down about 50 pages, none of it an actual novel.

Published author here. There is a big difference between \"author\" and \"published author\".\n\nAn author writes. Even if their writing is not finished, they are still an author. A published author has their writing published. It is usually \"finished\" at that point (subject to any possible future revisions), but there are some cases of unfinished prose being published, usually posthumously.", "Interesting, im a musician as well, and I guess by your definition id be a writer as well. I created a concept for one of my records (that never got done), and it included several characters, storyline and the whole shebang. I actually wrote everything down. Made some artwork for it as well. The files should still be floating around somewhere on my various cloud services. \n\nI would however never call myself an author or writer. If conversation comes around to writing, i might talk about it, but thats the extent of it. In my opinion you arent really an author untill you have actually finished some sort of literally work, be it a book or a short story or a comic, on your own accord. I feel like including everyone who ever put any sort of creative idea on paper is really streching it. I mean, if we do that, we should consider anyone who ever had to write a fictional paper for school an author as well. \n\nI just think its a bit disingenuous from OPs friend to keep refering to herself as an author. Especially comparing herself to someone who has actually finished a book. Its like calling yourself a songwriter without ever writing a song. It just rubs me the wrong way. Is it gatekeeping? Maybe. But I feel like anyone who is actually serious about being an author wouldnt actually do this. An author would actually write something. OPs friend simply seems like she enjoys the attention and acts like she is something she is not.", "Consulting the dictionary:\nAs a verb, author is simply a more distinguished term for write. A writer can be anyone who writes anything.

Thus, a self-published author is both the author and publisher.\nhttps://letterreview.com/are-the-publisher-and-author-the-same-person/#:~:text=If%20an%20author%20self%2Dpublishes,get%20the%20title%20of%20publisher.\n\nBasically, if you're a self-published author, that means you both wrote and published the work by your own. On the other hand, you can also have someone publish it for you, but then you wouldn't be a self-published author. Either way, self-published or not, you need to have your written work published in order to become an author.", "These aren't dictionaries though, these are opinion pieces. If you google actual dictionaries they say an author is just someone who writes.", "That's someone trying to designate it as one thing or another and failing. There would be no need to call an author a published author if being an author requires you to be published. That would be like saying a published author who is published. \n\nThe fact that your last sentence doesn't even make sense is a perfect example of why you should probably stop now. You do not have to be a published author to be an author. Further, being published can mean as little as disseminating your work online. And further still, you don't have to even write anything to be an author. There are musicians who authored great works without ever setting them down on paper or in any form other than memory on their instrument and with their voices. They are just as much authors.\n\nI also question why you brought up self-publishing the way you did. It would seem you just want to confuse the issue. Self-publishing doesn't necessarily all or even most of what you claim it does. You can self-publish online without  editing, marketing, sourcing a printer, and or paying for any of those things. It's actually quite simple.", "According to [Indeed](https://ca.indeed.com/career-advice/finding-a-job/author-vs-writer), \u201cThe defining difference between authors and writers is that authors publish their work.\u201d This is why people who write books are called authors, and why the writers of the WGA (screenwriters) are called writers rather than authors. An author is someone who publishes what they write in the written format. Songwriters and lyricists are called writers rather than authors for the same reason. You don\u2019t say that Gerard Way \u201cauthored\u201d The Black Parade, you say that he wrote it. \n\nIt\u2019s like squares and rectangles. All authors are writers, but not all writers are authors."]}
