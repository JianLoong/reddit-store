I\u2019m also WFH and have different routines depending on who\u2019s home with me, so it\u2019s entirely possible that the resentment could be caused by having to alter her routine too, or having someone around who is usually gone while she\u2019s working (this is an assumption based on you saying you work contracts for a few months btw, and I apologize if I\u2019m wrong about that). I would sit down and talk with her, tbh.  \n\nAlso a side story to caution you, I\u2019ve been on the receiving end of being woken up LONG before my alarm (usually between 4 and 5 AM) and I can tell you, nothing in that relationship caused resentment to fester as quickly as that did.

It's not your responsibility to behave in ways that don't trigger her judgementality and control issues. \n\nIf it annoys her to see you fucking off while she's working in the same space, maybe she needs to think about alternative spaces in which to work.

You're not relaxing \"at her.\" You're not even doing anything that could be compared to smoking, in the second hand smoke kind of way. \n\nBoth of you seem to have very poor social instincts (not surprising, given that fully neurotypical folks often have bad social instincts and no neurodivergence with which to contextualize it). Your instinct to hurt her because how she's behaving is hurting you is a very very very very bad instinct, and one you should pay attention to. Whenever you justify doing something you know will harm or annoy or otherwise inconvenience someone just so that you can SHOW THEM, that's a moment to stop. That's an indication that you either are in an untenable situation you need to remove yourself from, or that you need to change the situation in a meaningful way. Not that you are justified in doing something you know will bring unhappiness or discomfort to others. \n\nIf she cannot understand the problem, blames you completely, and is unwilling to change her focus to herself, rather than to you. She can ask herself why you being in the same space not-working bothers her so much. Is that a sign that she needs to find a job that better suits her interests and needs? Is that a sign that she needs a work space that is separate from your living space (healthy, if at all possible)? \n\nIt's a moment for curiosity, on her part.
