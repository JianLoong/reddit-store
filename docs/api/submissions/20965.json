This is because my house has a large backyard and a pool. I told A that D was coming into town that day for a meeting and that I would have to ask him.\n\nD asked me; Do you trust A and B with this? He also said he didn't want a massive party of people him or myself don't know. \n\nI have two dogs that are friendly but very high energy. I had told A that I would take them to a pet resort overnight so they wouldn't interfere with the party or complicate it. Neither A or B ever offered to cover the costs involved with that and it made me start thinking; \"It would be nice to not have to lodge them for parties like this\". \n\nYesterday, A asked me what time I had planned on taking them over to the pet resort, which is a 45 minute drive each way. I told her that I decided to let them stay for the party so I could acclimate them to parties at the house. A got upset and said that me making this decision without her approval was frustrating, especially the day before the party. She also said that this was her and B's party and it's not my place to make decisions like that. \n\nShe said, with so many people coming over it would be unfair and stressful for everyone coming to the party and for the dogs. \n\nThat confused me, because there were only supposed to be 10 people total here. To me that wasn't that many so now that she's stating so many people are coming, I asked if there was a change to the original 10. She claimed \"A lot more people are coming\" but could not associate a number.\n\nShe then explained how rude, frustrating, and important of a change I made on my own. To which I responded with, \"It's my house and my dogs, if I want them to be here then it should be okay for them to be here\". She told me I wasn't listening to her point and that's when I got upset with the headcount.\n\nShe told me the amount of people doesn't matter and I shouldn't be annoyed or frustrated with that. She then told me that she wouldn't care about that at all if I did that at her house.\n\nShe then told me that this is her and B's party that how I'm being rude and I shouldn't be making changes that effect their party and their friends. I responded out of frustration with, \"Well it's mine and D's house that you're throwing this party at, so I think it's very rude how you're acting\". She then hung up.\n\nI took yesterday and today off work to get the house set up for this party. I've been cleaning the house to make sure it's presentable. Not once have either A or B offered to come and help with setting up or cleaning either the house or backyard nor offered to cover any of the costs I'm incurring by hosting this party. They even asked me to go out any buy stuff for their party.", "created_utc": 1688121486, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14mwtb7/aita_for_getting_mad_about_a_party_my_gf_is/", "score": 41, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

CANCEL the party! From 10 people to \"a lot\" is some bullshit.

You're being a doormat and she is being a manipulative spoiled brat.", "Stop being a doormat and cancel the party, your girlfriend doesn't respect you", "You are being a doormat, as others have already commented. Your girlfriend is exploiting you and is being extremely inconsiderate.\n\nLook up the local non-emergency line for the police in your area, and consider calling them immediately should this get out of hand.\n\nESH. Your girlfriend is lazy and entitled and taking gross advantage of you, and you are letting her.", "NTA. If she not willing to respect your boundaries all the while expecting you to indulge her in a huge favor, it's time to re-evaluate that relationship.\n\nEdit: Just took a peek in your post history. With your pets, hobbies and interests combined, i really wouldn't be comfortable with a bunch of strangers getting boozed up at your place. I sure as hell would make sure none of them would be in the same room as my pets and (if i had any) firearms.", "NTA, cancel the party. This is going to be a absolute nightmare that you and your roommate are going to regret.", "NTA nahhhhh why are you doing everything and allowing ur gf to degrade your power over ur house and dogs, u better have a stern talk with her or break up with her because she is a complete hypocrite for her to get mad about u letting YOUR dogs stay at home and then her change the amount of people coming", "Cancel the party and ditch the GF...", "You're a nice guy. I would have gone, 'apologise or find another place for your party.'\n\nPossibly too nice because I think they're taking advantage of you.\n\nNTA", "NTA, I'd tell her to have it at her place.", "NTA- Are you going to be at the party? If not I would take before and after pictures.", "NTA. She is acting entitled and being incredibly disrespectful. She should be going the extra mile to make sure YOUR home is ready for HER party. Her behavior is a huge red flag. Do not be surprised at the number of guests exceeds WELL beyond the original 10.", "I'd definitely cancel the entire thing. The disrespect from your gf should be a dealbreaker. The audacity of some people..", "Info: Why are you being such a doormat? Your gf volunteers your house for a party for other people and you not only allow it but take time off work to prepare for it? WTH?", "NTA. I think she is taking advantage of using your things in my opinion (in this case, your house).\n\n Considering that she didn't bother to help cleaning, or even helping with the dogs, also telling you that it's her \"B's\" thing and not yours (in your house), and even asking you to buy stuff about the party, not planning things on how many people there would be, as the first number of people \"changed\"... \n\nWell all this behaviour, in my opinion, is considered rude and unrespectful in a relationship (because it doesn't show transparancy), even more when you are the one being asked for a favour, that is for your \"A's\" relatives, and this shows a sign of respect and love against your \"A\".\n\n I think you should talk with your \"A\" about this behavior and what bothers you, and try to figure out what the best can be done together with her. Again, this is my opinion.", "NTA - you are going above and beyond by hosting, vouching for them to your roommate, cleaning the place all day (and presumably more after it's over), considering driving 1.5 hours and paying for dog lodging.\n\nShould you have informed her as soon as you changed your mind about the dogs? Yes. But dogs are fine at parties, even energetic ones, and you haven't said anything to make it seem like the dogs will seriously ruin the party.\n\nMy favorite part is her saying \"it's not your place to make decisions\" like that when it's literally your place the party is happening, lol", "NTA\n\nA and B are entitled and don't respect boundaries, nor the rules you told them in advance. Honestly, you would be soooo much in your rights to call off the party, if only to teach them a valuable lesson in respect and recognition...", "NTA \nWhy are you cleaning the house and doing all the preparations? They should consider themselves lucky to even be able to host there why are you doing the work? It's your gf sisters bf O.o wtf honestly this sounds like they are taking advantage of you big time! Don't prepare anything for this, tell her it's her responsibility or cancel the party in general. \nAlso makes me wonder how the rest of your relationship is going. Is she always taking advantage of you like this?", "NTA\n\nWhen you book an event the venue has a right to ask how many guests are to be expected. If the person who has booked the venue underestimates or just disregards the venues advisories on attendance they are within their right to refuse entry.\n\nI will say that going back on taking your dogs to a resort is a bit of an AH move but if you expected only 10 people that is much more manageable than 20. I'd say 10 is enough for the dog not to feel overwhelmed by so many new people. More than that I'd be worried they get upset or unwell due to discomfort.\n\nI'm not sure if they should have contributed to the dog resort honestly in fairness to them also.\n\nEDIT: also the entitlement on the other side is astounding.", "Nta. Your gfs being really ungrateful and is trying to steamroll  you a bit. Get ready for a ton of people at your house because she does not care about your concerns or opinions about this party at all, let alone the work you're actually doing  for it.", "Why are you tolerating this? If they are not helping to clean up in preparation, they will not help clean after the party. If they were not willing to pay for your dog's boarding, they will not pay for anything that gets broken. Further, you are doing wrong by your roommate. Sorry, but I would go with ESH - you are the A H toward yourself and your roommate. Your GF and sister are even bigger AHs. You need to put a stop to your complacence.", "NTA. This is crazy to me. Sounds really entitled of her. Even if you are in a place in your relationship that it\u2019s okay to have a party at your SO\u2019s house, she should be considerate of you and keep you informed and ensure you\u2019re comfortable with everything they\u2019re planning. Suddenly turning it into a much larger party without checking in with you is disrespectful. Let alone expecting you to take on a lot of the prep work/costs. Jeez.", "Why are you still ok with it? That party isn't even for you or your gf, it's for your gf's sister's boyfriend. And it gonna cause friction with your roommate. And you gonna clean up afterwards.\n\nActually, why are you still ok with these relationship?", "Make sure you lock down all your and your flatemate's rooms and valuables. Let them use the kitchen and bathroom, everything else is outside where damage is less likely. \n\nIf they turn it into a huge party or don't help you clean after, then its time to reevaluate if you want to do anything for them in future.", "You\u2019re the id**t\u2026why are you being such a pushover?", "NTA she\u2019s abusing your generosity. Where do people come up with this kind of entitlement lol", "NTA!! a few weekends ago i wanted to host a murder mystery party for some friends. my apartment is not big enough and my boyfriend lives in a house that\u2019s been divided into three apartments (one for each floor) and him, his roommates, and his friends who live on the floor above were nice enough to let me have it there. they were all invited obviously. i got there hours early to cook. my boyfriend wanted to help and offered to clean and set up (which i am so grateful for because i would not have had enough time) and also helped clean up after the party. quite frankly he did a lot because he loves me but also he offered i didn\u2019t make him do that and i appreciate it so much. i also paid for everything for the party which it sounds like they didn\u2019t. this is all to say that you\u2019ve gone above and beyond what should be expected of you because you love her and she seems like she doesn\u2019t appreciate it at all and is even being rude to you about it", "NTA dude. Are you even \"allowed\" to attend the party? FUCK that. How disrespectful and entitled can one person be?\n\nI'd be bending over backwards thanking you, keeping you up to date on info, and cleaning myself for the party.

I agree but if you choose not to then decide how many people you think it\u2019s appropriate and or safe to have, especially considering the pool. Communicate the number to your girlfriend and be prepared to turn away people when you hit the head count. You probably don\u2019t want to read about your party in tomorrow\u2019s news.

You\u2019re out of your mind that your tolerating this. You get no say in your own house and your doing and paying for it. Your dogs bite someone, someone gets hurt, someone gets in an accident after they leave if they\u2019ve been drinking then you get sued and don\u2019t expect your homeowners insurance to cover your negligence.

Your 28 and just going along with all this. Expect to be fighting with your roommate after this.

Because the plain disregard of the trouble you go through to prepare your place for the party makes me think she might be with you just for the pool.\n\nAlso. Cancel the party. Lockup everything.
