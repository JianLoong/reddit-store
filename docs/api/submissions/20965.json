This is because my house has a large backyard and a pool. I told A that D was coming into town that day for a meeting and that I would have to ask him.\n\nD asked me; Do you trust A and B with this? He also said he didn't want a massive party of people him or myself don't know. \n\nI have two dogs that are friendly but very high energy. I had told A that I would take them to a pet resort overnight so they wouldn't interfere with the party or complicate it. Neither A or B ever offered to cover the costs involved with that and it made me start thinking; \"It would be nice to not have to lodge them for parties like this\". \n\nYesterday, A asked me what time I had planned on taking them over to the pet resort, which is a 45 minute drive each way. I told her that I decided to let them stay for the party so I could acclimate them to parties at the house. A got upset and said that me making this decision without her approval was frustrating, especially the day before the party. She also said that this was her and B's party and it's not my place to make decisions like that. \n\nShe said, with so many people coming over it would be unfair and stressful for everyone coming to the party and for the dogs. \n\nThat confused me, because there were only supposed to be 10 people total here. To me that wasn't that many so now that she's stating so many people are coming, I asked if there was a change to the original 10. She claimed \"A lot more people are coming\" but could not associate a number.\n\nShe then explained how rude, frustrating, and important of a change I made on my own. To which I responded with, \"It's my house and my dogs, if I want them to be here then it should be okay for them to be here\". She told me I wasn't listening to her point and that's when I got upset with the headcount.\n\nShe told me the amount of people doesn't matter and I shouldn't be annoyed or frustrated with that. She then told me that she wouldn't care about that at all if I did that at her house.\n\nShe then told me that this is her and B's party that how I'm being rude and I shouldn't be making changes that effect their party and their friends. I responded out of frustration with, \"Well it's mine and D's house that you're throwing this party at, so I think it's very rude how you're acting\". She then hung up.\n\nI took yesterday and today off work to get the house set up for this party. I've been cleaning the house to make sure it's presentable. Not once have either A or B offered to come and help with setting up or cleaning either the house or backyard nor offered to cover any of the costs I'm incurring by hosting this party. They even asked me to go out any buy stuff for their party.", "created_utc": 1688121486, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14mwtb7/aita_for_getting_mad_about_a_party_my_gf_is/", "score": 1103, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Again, this is my opinion.", "NTA - you are going above and beyond by hosting, vouching for them to your roommate, cleaning the place all day (and presumably more after it's over), considering driving 1.5 hours and paying for dog lodging.\n\nShould you have informed her as soon as you changed your mind about the dogs? Yes. But dogs are fine at parties, even energetic ones, and you haven't said anything to make it seem like the dogs will seriously ruin the party.\n\nMy favorite part is her saying \"it's not your place to make decisions\" like that when it's literally your place the party is happening, lol", "NTA\n\nA and B are entitled and don't respect boundaries, nor the rules you told them in advance.

Is she always taking advantage of you like this?", "NTA\n\nWhen you book an event the venue has a right to ask how many guests are to be expected. If the person who has booked the venue underestimates or just disregards the venues advisories on attendance they are within their right to refuse entry.\n\nI will say that going back on taking your dogs to a resort is a bit of an AH move but if you expected only 10 people that is much more manageable than 20. I'd say 10 is enough for the dog not to feel overwhelmed by so many new people. More than that I'd be worried they get upset or unwell due to discomfort.\n\nI'm not sure if they should have contributed to the dog resort honestly in fairness to them also.\n\nEDIT: also the entitlement on the other side is astounding.", "Nta.

Even if you are in a place in your relationship that it\u2019s okay to have a party at your SO\u2019s house, she should be considerate of you and keep you informed and ensure you\u2019re comfortable with everything they\u2019re planning.

That party isn't even for you or your gf, it's for your gf's sister's boyfriend. And it gonna cause friction with your roommate.

Where do people come up with this kind of entitlement lol", "NTA!! a few weekends ago i wanted to host a murder mystery party for some friends. my apartment is not big enough and my boyfriend lives in a house that\u2019s been divided into three apartments (one for each floor) and him, his roommates, and his friends who live on the floor above were nice enough to let me have it there. they were all invited obviously. i got there hours early to cook. my boyfriend wanted to help and offered to clean and set up (which i am so grateful for because i would not have had enough time) and also helped clean up after the party. quite frankly he did a lot because he loves me but also he offered i didn\u2019t make him do that and i appreciate it so much. i also paid for everything for the party which it sounds like they didn\u2019t. this is all to say that you\u2019ve gone above and beyond what should be expected of you because you love her and she seems like she doesn\u2019t appreciate it at all and is even being rude to you about it", "NTA dude.
