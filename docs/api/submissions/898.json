My mum always says she doesn\u2019t have favourites, BUT SHE DOES! It\u2019s clear to everyone else, but she won\u2019t admit it EVER. \n\nIt\u2019s not fair. It sucks. What really stands out to me is that you have autism and depression and she isn\u2019t being supportive. Not sure of any details other than what you have posted here, but perhaps there is some shame from your mum that you have these diagnoses? Maybe she is ashamed of that and therefore focuses on your brother because it\u2019s easier. \n\nThis doesn\u2019t make it ok, or easier on you, it was just a thought that may help you understand why things are happening the way they are. \n\nGood luck! I hope things get better for you as you get older and gain more independence :)", "NTA hope you have someone else you can open up and talk too to get the support your mother is lacking in I am sure you will do well in college and stick with it especially if it\u2019s something you want to do in your life good luck op", "NTA. I'm sorry your mother is being like this. What does your brother think? Is your dad around?", "NTA that sounds horrible I mean she threatened your dead dog? Have you talked to your dad if he's in the picture to get his thoughts? Hope you're ok that kind of environment would really mess with a person.", "NTA.\n\nNow I can't truly tell you if your mum is favouriting your brother or not. I can tell you as a twin myself, in my teen years I often felt like my brother was favourited. \n\nIt took me into my mid-twenties to come to a realization that my parents had a different, but equal, relationship with him. I think because the nature of how people treat twins I always felt like I wasn't measuring up to him in some capacity and it left me feeling like I was the one always being picked on. \n\nI would suggest you sit down with your mum and explain how you want your relationship with her to be. That *you* want to feel like she's proud of you and the choices you make, and that when she disagrees that you two can have a constructive conversation in turn about it. \n\nAnd then I would also suggest, stop trying to compare your relationship with your mum to your brother's. Pursue the relationship *you* want with her and in a way that feels respectful to you.", "NTA. My mum\u2018s favourite was one of my brothers, for a while, so I know what you\u2019re going through. If it helps it\u2019s not your fault - in my family\u2019s case, my older brother was a poorly baby and my dad was randomly awful to him, so that\u2019s why. Over time my brother became a total AH and my mum doesn\u2019t see him that way any more. Hopefully, she will soon see how much she\u2019s messed up and change - but I wouldn\u2019t bet on it. Moving out ASAP would be best for you. So sorry to hear that you experienced this (and I would recommend locking the locket away somewhere she can never access until you can move out\u2026)", "NTA.\n\n>she threatened to throw away the fur clippings from my recently deceased dog I keep in a locket\n\nI was open minded until I read this. Accusing a parent of favouritism is nearly always highly subjective and could be due to a child misinterpreting or not seeing the full picture. However, this is an absolute AH move from your mum, no question.\n\nGood parents don't threaten such cruel retributions, ever. There's nothing you could have possibly done which would have made this a proportionate reaction from your mum. It's deliberate and permanently inflicting emotional pain.\n\n>She's thrown a fit and flung all the rubbish around the kitchen and walked out of the house.\n\nThis isn't how adults behave. This is toddler level stuff.", "Thank you. My sister and I are planning on moving out one day.", "Thank you. When my sister and I were diagnosed she tried to telling us it was all in our heads, and when that didn't work she started getting extra mean to us.", "Thank you. I'm really enjoying college.", "Thank you. I've tried sitting down to talk to her but she always takes offence and starts screaming. I wanted to add more background but the word limit was looming over me, but to put it simply, if all the emotionally damaging things my mum has ever said or done to me was a book, it would but a J.R.R Tolkien novel.", "Thank you. When I'm not wearing the locket I keep it hidden  under my bed.", "NTA. You think saying \"you wouldn't do such a thing if it was my twins dog\" to your mother is going too far??? I think your mother did a huge number on you. I'm sorry you have a bad mother.\n\nIn cases of favouritism, the victims would think they aren't worth anything in their mother's/father's/ parent's eyes. But you are worth it, and you matter. Begin your preparations to move out ASAP if you haven't already been doing so.", "NTA\n\nthere is nothing you can do except get the hell out of this house a soon as possible.\n\ninfo : what your brother think about all of this ?", "NTA. \n\nHowever, from reading your replies, your dad is T A. His lack of action in supporting you or even seeming to have a conversation with your mother about her favoritism, explosive behavior, cruel threats, etc. is an active choice he\u2019s making. \n\nThat\u2019s F\u2019d up. I can get not wanting to \u201cpick sides\u201d but there shouldn\u2019t be sides to choose from in the first place.", "Some cultures still promote the importance of male babies vs female\u2019s.  I\u2019m so sorry you are going through this.  This isn\u2019t about you but rather your moms issue. I know it\u2019s easy to come to understand but this isn\u2019t your issue but hers.

I don't know the whole story of you and your family and so could only guess according to your thread.  \n\n\nIt's seen to me to be a classical case of sexism. This discussion is tedious and the only blame I could put on you is to have used anger as a way to open you in. \n\nYou should have an adult discussion with your mother on this matter. But be carefull, the one who become angry is the one who loose an argument :)", "NTA\n\nYour father is a coward.

Your mother sounds like an unhinged person. Move out as soon as you can.", "NTA\n\nMove out as soon as you can and let her see how much her golden child does", " You spoke the truth. NTA", "NTA. This sounds like abuse, and honestly the favoritism probably has more to do with your brother being a guy than anything you\u2019ve done to her.\n\nIt is not normal for your mother to respond to an undone chore by threatening to throw away an emotionally significant item. That is abuse.", "NTA. Google scapegoat child.", "I understand what you did to your mum.  You were born female.  Sorry that you are the scapegoat.  Use that college education to get out ASAP.  NTA", "NTA\n\nFirst off the favoritism is blatently there and cruel, but more importantly THE DOG THING WHAT MESSED UP HUMAN WOULD SAY THAT LIKE WTF\n\nsorry just really love aninals", "NTA\n\nFavoritism sucks, but unfortunately you probably won't ever be able to reason with your mom.\n\nI was in a similar situation - I have a twin brother and younger sister.  My brother was special because he was the boy and my sister was the favorite because she was the youngest, and I was the family servant.  I'd get in trouble for my sister not doing her chores and my brother didn't have to do much of anything.  My mom steamrolled my dad too.  When I tried to tell him what was going on, my mom told me that they were fighting because of me and if they got a divorce it would be my fault.  \n\nIt's not right, and you didn't do anything wrong.   It is unlikely that your mom will ever admit to being unfair.  I hope you can get out soon.  Keep working at your college program.  Get out when you're able to do so and live your best life.", "NTA. Your mom is abusive and showing clear favoritism! I\u2019d be planning to move out as soon as you legally and financially can and going no contact with her and your dad since he can\u2019t be bothered to stick up for you and your sister.", "NTA I dont know why my kids dont visit me", "NTA she had a shit fit because she got called out not because you did something wrong.", "NTA\n\nHoney, this goes way beyond favoritism. Threatening to throw away a sentimental item is in no way an appropriate consequence for dishes not being done (assuming this was a chore that was even assigned to you in the first place). And throwing trash around because you said something she didn't like? Again, completely disproportional to the situation, and not something an adult should be doing in response to something a teenager said. \n\nIt is actually very common for abusive people to single out one of their children as the target of all of their frustration. It is not anything that you've done. It's her own issues. \n\nWhen a parent has failed this badly, I really don't think there's much you can do that *is*  over the line. That said, I would recommend avoiding conflict as much as possible for your own wellbeing until you are able to move out, then going low or no contact.", "NTA you didn\u2019t do anything wrong. I wanted a boy when I was pregnant and of course I had a girl. I thank God he didn\u2019t listen to me and gave me a girl. My daughter and are I very close and I wouldn\u2019t want it any other way.", "NTA. I very much suspect there are other issues going on with your mum than no one helps with the housework. It's one of those horrible things about being your age that you're old enough to recognise the stresses in your parents' lives, but not to do anything to get away from them. It's not fair that it's being taken out on you like that, I'm really sorry to hear this.", "NTA I grew up with a mother and an older brother who could do absolutely no wrong. He'd even lie badly and blame stuff on me and she would take his side. He couldn't do anything wrong in her eyes. She valued boys, he was her golden child, she didn't value me even though I was working hard at school and doing well. I was her scape goat, her victim. When I had a boy then a girl she tried to do the same thing, but I wouldn't let her. Funny thing was my brother went to therapy and went NC with her long before I did. You haven't done anything wrong, this is on her, not you. You have to value yourself and look for self worth in yourself and not from her.  Don't spend your life looking for validation from her. Try to think what you want from life, your hopes and dreams and try to work towards it in small steps. Get a plan and leave her behind.", "You accused her of whe favouritism she blatently shows. The cap fits but she doesn't want to wear it. NTA.", "Don\u2019t let it get to you, the more mature children usually get the most blame.

I moved across the country for school, mother didn't visit me once in 3 years. Brother moved across the country, mother visits him 3 times in the first year.
