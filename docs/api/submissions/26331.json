MIL knows that is not our style and we were wanting a rocker for the baby\u2019s room that was more comfortable. \n\nWell, that rocking chair has been in my toddler\u2019s room for 2 years now and not getting any use. It is incredibly uncomfortable and it provided no support when I was post partum and up late at night rocking the baby. \n\nMy husband doesn\u2019t like the chair either and now we\u2019re converting the room to a toddler room and trying to make it safe since my child won\u2019t be in the crib any longer. We asked MIL if she wanted it to take to her house since we have no storage space, we live in a small home with 0 storage.  \n\nThe options were either she take it to store at her home or I post it on buy nothing. She got really upset and telling us it\u2019s an heirloom and we NEED to keep it in our house and use it.\n\nBackground info: MIL tends to unload a lot of crap onto us that she finds thrifting but we are minimalists. We have asked her to stop bringing stuff over because we have no room. She acts very offended when we don\u2019t want something. Also, the rocking chair is very wobbly and not sturdy because she gave it to us broken when I was 9 months pregnant and expected us to fix it and we never got around to it. \n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1694009056, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16bl6cw/aita_for_asking_my_mil_to_take_the_antique/", "score": 68, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
