I am the only female apart from my mom.\n\nWhere I live is quite hot so I normally wear shorts around the house but they are always long and cover up my thighs. The only time I wear short shorts is when I go to sleep as I sweat a lot. I also wear tank tops but have a cardigan or something light on top.\n\nAnyway, most of the time my clothes are appropriate to go out in or to be around family. \n\nHowever, it has become hotter so i\u2019ve started not wearing a cardigan because even a light material makes me sweat. \n\nBut all of my clothes cover my chest and back and are seen as modest in a way.\n\nWhen I wake up and i\u2019m wearing my shorts i always change into something else in case my brothers or anyone else is around.\n\nNow my step father seems to have a problem with it. He told my mother that i\u2019m dressing like a \u201cslut\u201d and need to cover up. He also told her that i\u2019m being suggestive around my brothers.\n\nI\u2019m not close to them and mostly stay in my room so there is no way for me to be \u201csuggestive\u201d. All of them walk around shirtless anyway.\n\nMy mother told me that I should wear longer clothes to give him peace of mind but if my clothes get longer then i\u2019m going to be boiling.\n\nI also told her that if i have to cover up then my brothers do too and they have to stop coming into my room to use my mirror and flex after they workout.\n\nShe says that it\u2019s just what boys do but i told her that until something changes for them then im not going to change my clothes.\n\nNow every time i walk in to the living room or kitchen my step dad tells my brothers \u201cnot to look at me\u201d.\n\nSo AITA for not changing my clothes?", "created_utc": 1681401076, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12ktlk8/aita_for_not_dressing_the_way_my_step_father_wants/", "score": 56, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
