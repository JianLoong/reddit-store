Neither boys nor girls should be showing off their undergarments. The finger tip rule is absurd because kids grow unevenly seemingly overnight.\n\nTank tops that cover your back and chest and non-booty shorts? Girl, you're fine. You don't need knee length shorts and turtle neck t-shirts to your elbows to be covered appropriately.\n\nAnyone trying to apply overly restrictive dress codes at best is misguided, outdated, prudish, and at worst is toxicly creepy and you should be lining up a safe space away from them.

SD is a creep and anyone who decides to be brave enough to tell me that my child is dressing slutty (especially a parental figure) I would call them out on the fact that they are sexualizing my child.  My mom fixed a dress for my teenaged niece and asked me if I thought it was appropriate for church.
