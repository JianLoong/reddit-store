At that point, it\u2019s on her. If she\u2019s ants pretty pictures, she can wrap pretty gifts. Like your MIL said, most people don\u2019t pay attention to the wrapping.

I can't wrap worth a damn either so I get it, and you tried to do other solutions and she turned her nose up at it", "NTA. You tried multiple solutions that would make her happy, including a professional service, and she's upset because she wants \"Instagram worthy wrapping\" and all the solutions you tried were, apparently, not Instagram worthy.

Sounds like you literally got them professionally wrapped and she still wasn't happy , you found a solid compromise/ solution and she's still unhappy.

She's using the gift wrapping as an excuse to fight and make her seem like she is justified. Why did you marry her ? Is this new behavior?", "NTA - Your wife needs to get a grip on reality. Like if she's really starting arguments over something as small as gift wrapping she needs therapy or a reality check. Like you've given her 3 or 4 options and she's still not satisfied.

She's causing her own issue at this point because it sounds like you've really tried to make her happy.", "NTA and also this is NOT weaponized incompetence. If you'd chosen NOT to wrap them on purpose, or you threw the gifts in a garbage bag wrapped in packing tape or something, and then played the 'you do it better so you should just do it' card, THAT would be weaponized incompetence. However,  you did the task, in it's entirety, by yourself, and she just didn't like the way it looked. You then outsourced to someone else who could it in a more aesthetic way, she didn't like that either. Then you gave her a third option, to let her wrap them to her own standards, and that wasn't acceptable either. She's being unreasonable. If she wants the gifts to look 'pretty' to her completely unclear and frankly ridiculous standards, she can manage all the wrapping herself. It's literally paper that will be thrown in the garbage after it's opened.", "NTA. It sounds like you tried two very valid alternate approaches, and neither met her need. Then you asked her to help meet her own need, because you didn't know what to do.\n\nIf you had started with telling her to wrap her own presents, you would be the AH. But it sounds like you tried to meet her needs, and failed. Asking for help after that is not unreasonable", "NTA - your wife cares more about appearance on social media than the spirit of gift giving.  I couldn\u2019t handle this either.  She is the AH.", "NTA. If she wants the gifts to be so perfect for her perfect social media, she can make them perfect herself, as, according to her, you can\u2019t do that.", "You\u2019re an asshole for being married to somebody who is more worried about her presents looking social media ready than actually being appreciative.", "[deleted]", "ESH.  Your wife is definitely obsessed on the outside appearance of things, which seems ridiculous.  However, could you just ask her to help you learn?  Could you take a class?  Could you put the effort in?  That being said, I would have been satisfied either way.  It should be the thought that counts.  I do think she wants you to put the effort in that she does.  That might be part of the issue.", "Esh- just watch some YouTube videos and learn how to wrap like the rest of us did. If you cut the paper better, it will wrap much easier. Get some big ribbon and do a wrap / criss cross / tie a bow around it (like a simple shoelace bow is fine) and add a tag with her name hanging off it - it instantly makes it cute, not too much skill needed. Hang an ornament or decor thing off the bow. Tuck a candy cane in the ribbon. \n\n\nI think you\u2019re both wrong but for different reasons / levels. She needs to chill out and if she wants pretty gifts she needs to wrap them.\n\nBut I suspect and get a vibe from your words also that you barely put any effort into wrapping all the time, and just \u201cpaying someone to do it for you\u201d is kinda lame. I would be bummed/ disappointed to as I put a lot of thought into making it look nice as well as gift match the person. Is it possible it\u2019s the straw that broke the camels back and she goes above and beyond and is tired of the bare minimum ? \n\nOr did your wife go insta - crazy ? Tik-Tok Cuckoo? And expects too much and needs to chill? \n\nI suspect it\u2019s more that your wife needs to chill. But I partially empathize cause I\u2019m always on the receiving end of \u201cdidn\u2019t try very much\u201d and I hope I\u2019m not assuming too much. \n\nFor a fancy gift next time - order or make your own custom wrapping paper with collage of pics of you on the paper.", "ESH. I was getting ready to call you the full AH, given the element of weaponised incompetence, but because what she wants is presents wrapped in a very particular way just to make them pretty for/like social media pics, that makes her part of the problem here. It\u2019s one thing to expect a grown ass man to be able to decently wrap a gift, that\u2019s fine and you need to learn to do that. BUT it\u2019s entirely different to want the gifts wrapped in a very particular way, such that even a gift wrapping service wasn\u2019t good enough for her. \n\nYou need to learn to do better, and she needs to realise life isn\u2019t all about making things look like instagram pics. A nicely wrapped gift is all that is required, but if she wants a very particular aesthetic and only accepts it that one way, then she needs to do it herself.", "[deleted]", "YTA.  Asking someone to wrap their own presents is just ridiculous and claiming not to be able to wrap presents just reeks of \"I can't be bothered.\"  I don't buy your \"i can't wrap presents\" claim; this isnt rocket science.  However, your wife's desire for social media ready presents is also ridiculous.  if you put in the effort, she doesnt get to ridicule it.  So watch a youtube video on how to wrap presents (or go back to the professionals and just dont tell her) and wrap the presents.  Maybe go to a counselor to deal with the real issues that are behind all of this since you all are fighting over stupid things and attacking each other for it.", "[deleted]", "ESH. I\u2019m mostly on your side because your wife sounds shallow and impossible to please, but you don\u2019t ask your spouse to wrap their own presents. My grandfather could ask me to do that when we was 90, but you are a smart, capable woman who can learn fancy wrapping techniques from Pinterest or YouTube or a friend. (I helped a friend do her wrapping this year.)\n\nBut what you really need to do is sit down and have a mature conversation with her wife. Why does she have these expectations? Is it really important? What does she need to be content with the presents you give her? Why doesn\u2019t she teach you how to wrap to her standard if it\u2019s so essential? I understand your frustration, but this is something to talk about, not give up on and pull the slightly passive-aggressive move of essentially saying \u201cwell, you do it, then!\u201d", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The tricky part is the ends and that's not all that hard.\n\nOne you have a properly wrapped box, the ribbon is child's play, but a good bow takes practice- or buying a bow that uses the same ribbon (or ribbons) to stick to the package.\n\nUp your game more by adding a decorative element- small ornament, hand made card, couple cheap jungle bells, something.\n\nNote- in most cases, you only need to extra special on one or two gifts, just really nice one some others, and so on.\n\nThis isn't rocket science and there are lots of video tutorials if you need them.\n\nGet the basics in hand by practicing for her birthday, Valentine's, your anniversary, etc then play with upping your game by trying things like wrapping on the diagonal, Japanese cloth wrapping and tying techniques (which game the bonus where there fabric you wrap with can be a gift like a nice scarf, or be reusable next year)\n\nIt would not take much on your part to be a master wrapper, and you may discover that it is both fun and satisfying!", "This is so petty. Marriage is about compromise, making an effort, and appreciating efforts made. \n\nYou and your wife are both failing. You need to talk about expectations and realities. It\u2019s not okay for you to just throw your hands up and not try because you \u201ccan\u2019t\u201d. It\u2019s not rocket science. There are techniques to make a wrapping look presentable. You CAN do that, you just are choosing to not try and not practice. \n\nEqually, your wife can\u2019t expect your work-product to be artistry when you are learning. Which means she needs to appreciate the efforts made. Would she throw her child\u2019s drawing in the trash because it\u2019s not \u201cgood\u201d? Will she just chuck a heartfelt greeting card from you because you can\u2019t master calligraphy? \n\nESH\n\nNow, to be a bit more specific, after the history you had, instead of telling her to wrap them herself, you could have said \u201cyou know wifey\u2026I\u2019m not very good at wrapping gifts. Last year I put it the effort to try to learn and improve, and it really hurt my feelings that you didn\u2019t appreciate my effort. The year before I paid a service and you were unhappy that I didn\u2019t put in the effort myself. I feel like I can\u2019t win, and it makes me really dread gift-giving, because I end up feeling put down while trying to do something nice.\u201d  She obviously lacks awareness that she\u2019s essentially setting a trap for your failure and it\u2019s destructive to the relationship. But you are just lighting the match on the gasoline she\u2019s poured rather than communicating and working together to solve a problem. (And don\u2019t be afraid to admit to yourself that you don\u2019t LIKE wrapping, which has fed into why you haven\u2019t improved by now. Being adult sometimes means doing things we don\u2019t like to make others happy.)", "YTA if you actually want to make your wife happy, find someone who can wrap and pay them", "NTA. Get a new wife. This one sounds too shallow for their own good. Who in their right mind cares about how presents look on social media? That's stupid. Most wives are just happy to receive something/anything from their husbands. Ask me what I got from mine? Not a damn thing. By the time Dec 23rd rolled around, he STILL had not ordered the robe I picked out on Amazon and emailed to him. All he had to do was put it in his shopping cart and buy it. I was so upset, I told him to just forget it. At least you're not like that.  Your wife is too far up her own ass to appreciate your efforts.", "She shouldn't be mad if they aren't pretty.  \n\nBut, if you wrap them, and she thinks they aren't pretty, then she's the AH.   You are better off wrapping them in a messy manner, and having her be the AH by criticizing it.  \n\nHaving her wrap them makes you the AH.  And, really, have you even tried to learn how to properly wrap a present?  It's really only one you tube video away.", "NTA  I'm also terrible at wrapping presents,  when my niece was younger I used to pay her wrap presents for me she says it's her favorite job she ever had. I try to wrap presents now they come out terrible and my wife posts pics on Facebook and everyone including me gets a good laugh out of it.", "I was ready to say the opposite, but NTA. You tried, and nothing is making her happy. She can wrap perfect fake boxes for social media. You can wrap your present to her to the best of your abilities or throw it in a bag because it's the thought that counts.", "NTA, this is an absurd detail she is stuck on. You tried 2 alternative solutions that seem appropriate in \"normal\" circumstances. I mean yeah, you COULD absolutely practice, bit honestly it sounds like she still wouldn't have been happy with it. I mean, the boxes were blank.  Even her own mother doesn't understand why she's got her panties in such a twist. Meh. It's much ado about nothing.", "NTA. It\u2019s such a silly hill to die on. Some people do not have the patience or drive to wrap things like \u201csocial media perfect\u201d your wife should be happy you are getting gifts and remembering occasions more than making the packaging perfect.", "NTA  \n\nYour wife has a social media problem.  Seriously.", "Nta but not gonna lie this is a hella stupid argument. It\u2019s about the effort, thought and the overall gift not what it looks like. Give her a gift card in an envelope from now on.", "I kind of laughed a little when I read this one, because I\u2019m also a gift wrapping freak. I love perfectly wrapped boxes. My husband\u2019s wrapped gifts look like crumpled heaps of struggling tape and paper. I\u2019ve been guilty of hiding his in the back where they can\u2019t be seen. Then I feel guilty for being such a weirdo about it. So I don\u2019t have any advice. But I thank you for sharing this because I\u2019m feeling so much better about myself now. Kudos to you for making so much effort to please her.", "I LOVE wrapping and receiving nicely wrapped gifts but NTA, you've gone to a lot of effort. If you do want to practice however, here's some wrapping tips:\n\n  \n1. Pick a colour scheme e.g. red and gold, or brown paper and metallic green, whatever. Then buy 2-3 different papers in that colour scheme. aim for a bit of variety e.g. one solid gold paper, one red and gold striped, one gold with red designs. **Get thick wrapping papers**, not the very thin kind that creases/wrinkles easily. You'll have an easier time with paper the consistency of brown packing paper.\n\n2. Hit up a haberdashery or check online and get 2-3 ribbons in different sizes to match the colour scheme e.g. a wide flat red ribbon, a thin flat red ribbon, and a white/red striped twine.\n\n3. Put everything that isn't in a rectangular box into a rectangular box. Wrapping weird shapes sucks, don't do it.\n\n4. Get a flat surface, roll out the paper, measure out how much you need, cut it, have pre-cut strips of tape ready to help you secure it, then go back in with longer pieces after you've secured it and folded the paper.\n\n5. Use wider ribbons for larger presents, and thinner ones for smaller ones.", "NTA next year use brown paper bags. \n\nYou can also wrap them in scarves it looks kind of easy online", "NTA", "NTA of course.  But, does she have a holiday wrapping theme?  Some people do, and if your beautifully professionally wrapped gift is bright red when her carefully curated holiday theme is silver and pastel blue, then the issue could be that you haven\u2019t noticed all the work she\u2019s put into theming/decorating the home for the holidays.  I know I\u2019m clutching at straws here for a logical reason when there may not be one, but something to consider.  At our home, all the holiday gift wrap is themed (it\u2019s sad, I know) BUT it\u2019s also left in an accessible place and my immediate family members are specifically advised of the theme and location of wrapping products. It\u2019s quite satisfying to look at the colour coordinated wrapped gifts.  I know this is petty and superficial, but I was quite thrilled when my partner got on board.", "NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA!  \nGah! Had to respond cuz I am RIGHT THERE WITH YOU, u/op. I cannot wrap gifts to save my life!  \nMy mom and sister are amazing at it and every year of my childhood, my mom insisted that the three of us had to wrap ALL the family's gifts, as though having a uterus somehow inherently endows us with the talent to wrap gifts. (For the record, there are four more members of my nuclear family -- all male -- and they were never required to join us.) I had this exact argument with my mom countless times, where I'd try and try, and she'd tell me they didn't look good enough. Every year, she'd 're-teach' me and I still just couldn't get it. To this day (I am 37!), I still start to hyperventilate at the thought of having to wrap a present. (Team Gift Bag all the way, my friend!)\n\nIf your wife isn't satisfied with your attempts and she isn't satisfied with you hiring out the work, then the only options left are exactly what you presented her with: either she wraps them herself or they don't get wrapped. \n\nReal life isn't Instagram and Instagram isn't real life. Your wife needs to grow up and manage her expectations. One more time: NTA.", "Nta..  you have tried... Even went and paid for them to be wrapped and she isn't happy.\n\n  Then tough shit...\n\nI do gift bags and put extra tissue paper in it.", "I suspect that op's wife couldn't wrap a present like on social media to save her life, either.....", "She did and OP says, it wasn't something \"worth to write home about\" - nothing so special.", "I can\u2019t wrap presents to save my life.", "No gifts for your man in 2024.
