According to her, she wants social media ready presents. My solution: first year, I just used gifts bags, can\u2019t go wrong with gift bags. She wasn\u2019t happy. Second year: I used a gift wrapping service, usually they\u2019re charities or someone at the mall. She wasn\u2019t happy.

The kind you would see on Instagram\u201d, I asked why none of the previous solutions worked, her response was \u201cthey looked fake\u201d. This year, I put all the gifts in blank boxes, so she couldn\u2019t tell what was in them, and asked if she\u2019d wrap them for me. \n\nShe got upset asking why I couldn\u2019t wrap them, I told her could but she wouldn\u2019t be happy with the results and to avoid another argument it would be easier if she just did it. I explained that no matter what solution I came up with she wasn\u2019t happy, and she could either wrap the gifts herself or they would go unwrapped because I am tired of this whole situation. She claimed i was using \u201cweaponized incompetence to avoid wrapping gifts\u201d. \n\nNow she\u2019s complained to both sides of the family, and everyone is split.

Nicely wrapped presents are pretty, but it isn't a necessity. You tried. What's on the inside matters more.

These people who crave social media likes are the worst.   She seems far more concerned about display than anything else.  They also overdo buzz words like weaponized incompetence.

Over the years I've used both the wrapping services and the gift bags, the presents looks pretty, and no one has complained.", "NTA. You\u2019ve tried different methods, she wasn\u2019t happy. At that point, it\u2019s on her. If she\u2019s ants pretty pictures, she can wrap pretty gifts. Like your MIL said, most people don\u2019t pay attention to the wrapping. They see gifts, they get excited, they open gifts. That\u2019s it.", "NTA. Bloody Instagram... This is ridiculous", "NTA my husband is the same; can\u2019t wrap to save his life.  You know what?  He still tries and I love it.  \nThere is no \u201cwinning\u201d here and you did the only option left to you other than gift cards (which is exactly what I\u2019d do next year).", "NTA\n\nOP it sounds like your wife doesn't know what she wants or can't do \"pretty\" wrapping either and is just hoping you'll figure it out. \n\nThe rejection of the mall wrapped presents is wild to me bc those church ladies know how to make any shaped present look perfect and handmake the bows. \n\nDid she show you photo examples of what she wanted?", "Your wife sounds charming.... :/", "NTA. I can't wrap worth a damn either so I get it, and you tried to do other solutions and she turned her nose up at it", "NTA. You tried multiple solutions that would make her happy, including a professional service, and she's upset because she wants \"Instagram worthy wrapping\" and all the solutions you tried were, apparently, not Instagram worthy. Your wife sounds way too obsessed with Social Media clout.", "Wow not the asshole at all. Sounds like you literally got them professionally wrapped and she still wasn't happy , you found a solid compromise/ solution and she's still unhappy. Sounds like it doesn't Matter if the best gift wrapper in the world wrapped them she still wouldn't be happy. She's using the gift wrapping as an excuse to fight and make her seem like she is justified. Why did you marry her ? Is this new behavior?", "NTA - Your wife needs to get a grip on reality. Like if she's really starting arguments over something as small as gift wrapping she needs therapy or a reality check. Like you've given her 3 or 4 options and she's still not satisfied. She sounds tiring to me.", "NTA. It sounds like your wife has unrealistic and impossible expectations. Gift bags should be good enough. She's causing her own issue at this point because it sounds like you've really tried to make her happy.", "NTA and also this is NOT weaponized incompetence. If you'd chosen NOT to wrap them on purpose, or you threw the gifts in a garbage bag wrapped in packing tape or something, and then played the 'you do it better so you should just do it' card, THAT would be weaponized incompetence. However,  you did the task, in it's entirety, by yourself, and she just didn't like the way it looked. You then outsourced to someone else who could it in a more aesthetic way, she didn't like that either. Then you gave her a third option, to let her wrap them to her own standards, and that wasn't acceptable either. She's being unreasonable. If she wants the gifts to look 'pretty' to her completely unclear and frankly ridiculous standards, she can manage all the wrapping herself. It's literally paper that will be thrown in the garbage after it's opened.", "NTA. It sounds like you tried two very valid alternate approaches, and neither met her need. Then you asked her to help meet her own need, because you didn't know what to do.\n\nIf you had started with telling her to wrap her own presents, you would be the AH. But it sounds like you tried to meet her needs, and failed. Asking for help after that is not unreasonable", "NTA - your wife cares more about appearance on social media than the spirit of gift giving.  I couldn\u2019t handle this either.  She is the AH.", "NTA. If she wants the gifts to be so perfect for her perfect social media, she can make them perfect herself, as, according to her, you can\u2019t do that.", "You\u2019re an asshole for being married to somebody who is more worried about her presents looking social media ready than actually being appreciative.", "[deleted]", "ESH.  Your wife is definitely obsessed on the outside appearance of things, which seems ridiculous.  However, could you just ask her to help you learn?  Could you take a class?  Could you put the effort in?  That being said, I would have been satisfied either way.  It should be the thought that counts.  I do think she wants you to put the effort in that she does.  That might be part of the issue.", "Esh- just watch some YouTube videos and learn how to wrap like the rest of us did. If you cut the paper better, it will wrap much easier. Get some big ribbon and do a wrap / criss cross / tie a bow around it (like a simple shoelace bow is fine) and add a tag with her name hanging off it - it instantly makes it cute, not too much skill needed. Hang an ornament or decor thing off the bow. Tuck a candy cane in the ribbon. \n\n\nI think you\u2019re both wrong but for different reasons / levels. She needs to chill out and if she wants pretty gifts she needs to wrap them.\n\nBut I suspect and get a vibe from your words also that you barely put any effort into wrapping all the time, and just \u201cpaying someone to do it for you\u201d is kinda lame. I would be bummed/ disappointed to as I put a lot of thought into making it look nice as well as gift match the person. Is it possible it\u2019s the straw that broke the camels back and she goes above and beyond and is tired of the bare minimum ? \n\nOr did your wife go insta - crazy ? Tik-Tok Cuckoo? And expects too much and needs to chill? \n\nI suspect it\u2019s more that your wife needs to chill. But I partially empathize cause I\u2019m always on the receiving end of \u201cdidn\u2019t try very much\u201d and I hope I\u2019m not assuming too much. \n\nFor a fancy gift next time - order or make your own custom wrapping paper with collage of pics of you on the paper.", "ESH. I was getting ready to call you the full AH, given the element of weaponised incompetence, but because what she wants is presents wrapped in a very particular way just to make them pretty for/like social media pics, that makes her part of the problem here. It\u2019s one thing to expect a grown ass man to be able to decently wrap a gift, that\u2019s fine and you need to learn to do that. BUT it\u2019s entirely different to want the gifts wrapped in a very particular way, such that even a gift wrapping service wasn\u2019t good enough for her. \n\nYou need to learn to do better, and she needs to realise life isn\u2019t all about making things look like instagram pics. A nicely wrapped gift is all that is required, but if she wants a very particular aesthetic and only accepts it that one way, then she needs to do it herself.", "[deleted]", "YTA.  Asking someone to wrap their own presents is just ridiculous and claiming not to be able to wrap presents just reeks of \"I can't be bothered.\"  I don't buy your \"i can't wrap presents\" claim; this isnt rocket science.  However, your wife's desire for social media ready presents is also ridiculous.  if you put in the effort, she doesnt get to ridicule it.  So watch a youtube video on how to wrap presents (or go back to the professionals and just dont tell her) and wrap the presents.  Maybe go to a counselor to deal with the real issues that are behind all of this since you all are fighting over stupid things and attacking each other for it.", "NTA.\n\nI'm the one in my relationship whose the 'wrapping person'. My wife could do it neatly but she can't be bothered and to be honest its not that big a deal for me. I don't have an Instagram but if I cared about insta I would wrap my own presents like you offered or make ironic posts about the badly wrapped presents. It is textbook weaponised incompetence but it's not enough to warrant the asshole badge for your lazy ass.", "ESH. I\u2019m mostly on your side because your wife sounds shallow and impossible to please, but you don\u2019t ask your spouse to wrap their own presents. My grandfather could ask me to do that when we was 90, but you are a smart, capable woman who can learn fancy wrapping techniques from Pinterest or YouTube or a friend. (I helped a friend do her wrapping this year.)\n\nBut what you really need to do is sit down and have a mature conversation with her wife. Why does she have these expectations? Is it really important? What does she need to be content with the presents you give her? Why doesn\u2019t she teach you how to wrap to her standard if it\u2019s so essential? I understand your frustration, but this is something to talk about, not give up on and pull the slightly passive-aggressive move of essentially saying \u201cwell, you do it, then!\u201d", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
