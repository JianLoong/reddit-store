It\u2019s a pretty big gathering that normally involves my siblings, their partners, my sister\u2019s kids and our parents.\n\nThis year, my brother James (35m) and his wife Becky (31f) are having their first child. The baby is due in spring. \n\nWe have a traditional thanksgiving meal, watch the parade, play games as a family, couple drinks together in the evening, the usual stuff. Same kind of thing every year. \n\nThis year a couple weeks back, I get what is basically a list of demands from Becky in our family group chat. She wants to come, but her pregnancy means some things \u201cneed to be adjusted\u201d. Her rules were no poultry as the smell makes her sick, no alcohol as the smell makes her sick and she can\u2019t join in, the food needs to be served early as she needs to nap during the time it\u2019s normally served, and she doesn\u2019t want to play the games as she tires easily so can we just listen to music/talk in the evening instead.\n\nI was really upset by this. Firstly none of us are vegetarian and so I don\u2019t really know how to prepare a turkey alternative but secondly I\u2019d already ordered the turkey and it seems like a waste. And to not be able to drink, eat when we want to or even play our games in the evening just feels so unreasonable when 9 of us won\u2019t get to celebrate in the way we\u2019d like to. \n\nIn the family chat I replied and said while I would make her a non-poultry meal and would make sure people don\u2019t drink at the table, I wouldn\u2019t ban poultry or alcohol from the house and I certainly wouldn\u2019t be not playing our games. Particularly as my niece and nephew are now old enough to join in and really loved it last year.\n\nBoth James and Becky said I was being unreasonable and that she\u2019s pregnant so I need to be more understanding. My mom joined in and said it\u2019s not hard to accommodate but I was really annoyed by this point. I told Becky she was uninvited if she can\u2019t accept any compromise whatsoever. James called me separately to say I\u2019m excluding her and ruining their thanksgiving and she can\u2019t help how she feels during pregnancy. I said I wasn\u2019t excluding her and she\u2019s welcome if she can accept that thanksgiving has to work for everyone else too. \n\nIn the end neither Becky or James came over. It was a weird day without them and I\u2019m sad they weren\u2019t there but I feel like I wasn\u2019t unreasonable.

Is it possible for me to nap in a separate room?\" But no, she went overboard.", "NTA.

There is no need to make a amends to someone's ridiculous request. She was literally requesting that everyone be as miserable as she is just because she made the choice to get pregnant. You offered reasonable accommodations of making her an alternative meal and not drinking at the table. She wanted it to be her way or nothing at all. It's fine if her husband wants to give into childish behavoir but no one else should. I also love how your brother pointed out that you were ruining their Thanksgiving by not agreeing to do what she wanted, but failed to acknowledge that she was ruining yours and the rest of the family with her unreasonable request. If this is how she behaves while pregnant I hate to see how she will be as mom. She will probably be one of those parents who feels every family functions has to revolved around their pressures little angel.", "NTA. Being pregnant can really suck, but her demands weren't reasonable, and being pregnant isn't a carte blanche for everyone to bend to your every whim. \n\nI had some serious food aversions and lots of fatigue when I was pregnant. And I dealt with it mainly by changing what *I* did or asking (not demanding) slight accommodations that wouldn't inconvenience anyone. The smell of lettuce made me gag, so when I went to my salad-obsessed MIL's for a holiday meal I made sure I was sitting at the other end of the table from where the salad was. I genuinely needed naps so I took them before or after family events, and if I was too tired for family games I simply didn't participate. The smell of strong alcohol was really off-putting, so I did ask my husband not to drink cognac while sitting right next to me, but I did not say \"nobody in the house can drink anything\".", "NTA, they could have hosted themselves. Being pregnant doesn\u2019t make the world revolve around them.

You did not exclude her, she had a tantrum and excluded herself. If she had so many demands then she and your brother could have offered to host and put the effort into meeting all of her ridiculous demands.", "INFO: was the turkey already prepared two weeks in advance? Because you could\u2019ve frozen it and used at Christmas (ETA: or any other event; Turkey is good frozen up to a year). Pregnancy super smell usually abates further into pregnancy. \n\nDid you research alternatives to turkey? A lot of folks use ham and/or a seafood boil.\n\nWhat did the other family members think?", "NTA. The world doesn't just bend to you because you are pregnant. Expecting 9 other people to go without everything they normally have is outrageous behaviour. The entitlement is mind blowing. She could have napped while everyone ate, thus avoiding the smell of Turkey. And she could have participated from a sitting position or just spectated on the games. As far as the alcohol goes, if she sits not near anyone while they drink she'd be fine. There were so many compromises she could have made instead of trying to make everyone accommodate her. Being pregnant doesn't mean you get to be a jackass.\n\nYou wait till the kid comes - this one is going to have her own section in entitled parents, mark my words \ud83d\ude12\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44", "NTA.

Sigh. You\u2019re not the AH. Being pregnant does not entitle a person to upend an entire family event. She should have just said she couldn\u2019t come this year, instead of sending a runner of demands.

But I\u2019m a grown woman who has 3 kids already and I would never try to nap at the same time every day. Also, fine if she didn\u2019t want to participate in games but to not let anyone else play either is too much.

You already bought a turkey, so you\u2019d have to try and figure out exchanging it for some other meat which is too much. I think if you are requesting no Turkey at thanksgiving when one has already been bought, it\u2019s on you to make the alternative arrangements anyway. Not that you had to accept but they are AH for expecting that. \n\nSecondly, not playing games because she tired - she doesn\u2019t have to participate? She can just sit it out that year.

Changing the time of the meal is ridiculous, why couldn\u2019t she take a nap during the games?", "NTA. She and James were incredibly rude.", "NTA. Sounds like she is using her pregnancy to make things all about her. It sounds like you tried to come to a compromise but she wanted it her way only.

My husband and I have unreasonable family members on both sides and sometimes we just look at each other and go, \"is this just how life happens?\" It can also be very hurtful when your parents seem to take sides with the unreasonable family members because they know that relationship is more conditional than the one they may have with their stable, reasonable kids. \n\nNext year is going to be harder because people who make demands of others but can't handle anything being asked of them will always continue to make demands! Trust me, next year there will be rules about no choking hazards anywhere in the house, baby gates being required, quiet during the baby's nap time, etc. And you are going to want to grin and bear it for the sake of your kids having a relationship with their new cousin. Perhaps the next time a list is sent to the host the host can respond with something like, \"I wish I could accommodate you but it's just not possible for me to do all this.

That\u2019s unfortunate and in most situations I\u2019d say to cater to it. \n\nUnfortunately, it\u2019s also the key component of Thanksgiving meals. It\u2019s unreasonable to demand a change in menu with such short notice. \n\nHer other demands were just unreasonable from the beginning. \n\nBut the poultry one - that\u2019s unfortunate for her, but missing out was really her only option.

She said no. If Becky can't handle everything that the annual Thanksgiving gathering includes then she's better off relaxing at home. I hope the rest of the family enjoyed their day together.", "NTA\nIt is unfortunate that most of her issues are likely valid, but the reasonable thing to do as the pregnant person affected by everything would be the politely excuse yourself from the festivities. You offered a good compromise, she wanted an all or nothing. You were perfectly within your right to say don\u2019t come then.", "NTA\n\nWhat is with all these pregnant people acting like they are terminal and everyone needs to cater to their every whim?\n\nIf the nausea is that bad that you can't handle the smell of poultry or alcohol then you should stay home! \n\nYou don't get to disrupt everyone else's holiday because you chose to have a baby\n\nYou're carrying a baby human not an alien! \n\nI wouldn't have abided by their demands either OP", "NTA.

I couldn\u2019t eat in the cafeteria at work because it was so bad. Did I go to HR and complain? No. Did I tell my co-workers to not eat Mexican? No. I just excluded myself because pregnancy is temporary but my friendships and career were more important than my temporary pregnancy food aversions. Also, your brother is stuck in the middle.

There\u2019s tons of things you could do with the turkey if you can\u2019t use it. You could always just freeze it and use it at a later date. If you\u2019d already thawed it you could cook it, clean it off the bone, shred and then freeze. I\u2019ll usually portion it out in servings so then if you need a quick protein, meat for soup or a casserole, etc you have it handy. Can make some tasty soups and then freeze.
