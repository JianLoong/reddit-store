It\u2019s a pretty big gathering that normally involves my siblings, their partners, my sister\u2019s kids and our parents.\n\nThis year, my brother James (35m) and his wife Becky (31f) are having their first child. The baby is due in spring. \n\nWe have a traditional thanksgiving meal, watch the parade, play games as a family, couple drinks together in the evening, the usual stuff. Same kind of thing every year. \n\nThis year a couple weeks back, I get what is basically a list of demands from Becky in our family group chat. She wants to come, but her pregnancy means some things \u201cneed to be adjusted\u201d. Her rules were no poultry as the smell makes her sick, no alcohol as the smell makes her sick and she can\u2019t join in, the food needs to be served early as she needs to nap during the time it\u2019s normally served, and she doesn\u2019t want to play the games as she tires easily so can we just listen to music/talk in the evening instead.\n\nI was really upset by this. Firstly none of us are vegetarian and so I don\u2019t really know how to prepare a turkey alternative but secondly I\u2019d already ordered the turkey and it seems like a waste. And to not be able to drink, eat when we want to or even play our games in the evening just feels so unreasonable when 9 of us won\u2019t get to celebrate in the way we\u2019d like to. \n\nIn the family chat I replied and said while I would make her a non-poultry meal and would make sure people don\u2019t drink at the table, I wouldn\u2019t ban poultry or alcohol from the house and I certainly wouldn\u2019t be not playing our games. Particularly as my niece and nephew are now old enough to join in and really loved it last year.\n\nBoth James and Becky said I was being unreasonable and that she\u2019s pregnant so I need to be more understanding. My mom joined in and said it\u2019s not hard to accommodate but I was really annoyed by this point. I told Becky she was uninvited if she can\u2019t accept any compromise whatsoever. James called me separately to say I\u2019m excluding her and ruining their thanksgiving and she can\u2019t help how she feels during pregnancy. I said I wasn\u2019t excluding her and she\u2019s welcome if she can accept that thanksgiving has to work for everyone else too. \n\nIn the end neither Becky or James came over. It was a weird day without them and I\u2019m sad they weren\u2019t there but I feel like I wasn\u2019t unreasonable.

NTA.", "I'm leaning towards NTA.\n\nI feel like you made it a little bit more aggressive than necessary, but those demands were ridiculous. I'm pregnant atm, just getting out of the constant puking part which made me miss quite a few family get togethers. I still don't expect people (even family except the one I live with) to accommodate to me.\n\nThe poultry part is hard, because some smells really can make you throw up just from the faintest whiff. But at the same time there should have been some other way to fix that, it's not a solution to demand that thanksgiving is celebrated without turkey.\n\nThe rest of the demands are just ridiculous, and she probably won't stop demanding things if she'd gotten away with this after the baby is born.", "NTA yes you could serve beef or pork or something that wasn't poultry, but you'd already bought the turkey so that's not a reasonable request. If the event was being held at her house she could say no alcohol, but it's someone else's house so she can either suck it up or politely decline to attend as her stomach won't be up to it. And saying no one else can play games because she doesn't want to is beyond unreasonable", "NTA.  If Becky wants a Thanksgiving organized exactly to specifications that are the exact opposite of yours, James or one of the other people insisting she needs to get whatever she wants because she\u2019s pregnant can organize it for her.", "NTA.\n\nBeing pregnant doesn\u2019t mean the world revolves around you. You were more than accommodating. Personally I would have stopped after the food accommodation of providing an alternative.\n\nLike seriously if you can\u2019t handle people enjoying their life and having fun when you are pregnant, don\u2019t get pregnant. \n\nNTA. Your mom, brother and Becky sure are AH.", "Eh, a little ESH. \n\nNot poultry doesn\u2019t mean vegetarian, you could have done a roast beef or ham. Yes you\u2019d already ordered the turkey so understand that would have been a waste, could you have used it for Friendsgiving or something? \n\nThe alcohol thing is a bit much, ALL alcohol smells to her? And the games thing is ridiculous, just because she didn\u2019t want to play doesn\u2019t mean everybody has to miss out. \n\nI\u2019m just saying things could have been accommodated, and with pregnancy the smells can be super awful so I\u2019ll give her the benefit of the doubt of everything else was over the top so this my \u201cit\u2019s a little bit ESH\u201d.", "\"but her pregnancy means some things \u201cneed to be adjusted\u201d\n\nSince when did becoming pregnant become a national emergency for the people not involved?\n\n\"Hi, I'm pregnant!\"\n\n\"That's great!\"\n\n\"Thank you!

NTA", "NTA\n\nYou offered an acceptable alternative: a special meal for her and no alcohol at the table. She was welcome to nap/not join in games at her own discretion. Sometimes when pregnant you have to accept that there will be smells and situations that you have to make decisions about attending or not attending. It\u2019s no one else\u2019s problem to fix. \n\nYour bro & SIL are selfish and I only see it getting worse once their baby arrives. (Can\u2019t have thanksgiving in the afternoon due to baby\u2019s nap schedule etc)", "NTA\n\nYou offered reasonable compromise. She doesn't like it, she can host herself.", "**NTA** \n\nBecky and James\u2019 demands were unreasonable.", "NTA", "Yeah, sne sounds like a \"preg-zilla\" . No way is it reasonable to exspect everyone to upend their holiday for her morning sickness. \n\nI had hyperemesis gravidarum, as did my daughter, so I've experienced the worst of that condition. If you know you are going to struggle with triggers, (which for me was everything), you stay home. You don't get to ruin the traditional celebration for the whole family. Being pregnant does not make you the holiday ruler. \n\nNTA", "Wow. Really NTA.\n\nI get that pregnancy hormones can make you out of touch with your rational brain, but I've never understood couples that make themselves the center of the universe just because they're having a baby. Growing a whole human is hard, yes. But you can't expect everyone else to stop and drop their lives because you're doing something hard. \n\nYou obviously care about them, so I would reach out once things cool down. This really could have just been a case of hormones messing with her sense of reasonable... at least, I hope so.", "NTA... I am currently pregnant and the smell of alcohol makes me sick too and I am overly tired. Not in a million years would I think that anyone apart from my partner should have to go out of their way to accommodate me. Your solutions to offer an additional alternative and ban alcohol from the table are really reasonable compromises.  To ask 9 people to not play a game because she will be tired is wild. She can just go home earlier or watch you guys play...", "Yeah, NTA. The thing about compromise is that it involves compromise. It does not involve \u201ccompromise by giving me anything I want.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m a raging vegan and I think no poultry thanksgiving is absurd. It\u2019s thanksgiving among non-crazies. No drinks? What\u2019s even the point? :D\n\nNo games is where I\u2019m really gone. That\u2019s some psycho bridezilla nonsense. At that point you might as well literally say \u201cI don\u2019t think i can have fun so nobody is allowed to have fun.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s this cool new thing called \u201cyour wants are not my wants and I am not an NPC\u201d NTA", "NTA you gave her reasonable compromises, she chose not to compromise and only wanted it her way.

Being pregnant doesn't mean you get to dictate rules to others in their own homes. I had a super smeller and was nausea my entire pregnancy (I could smell when the water company changed the nature of the additives to the water supply). \n\nPoultry was awful to me, but if someone else handled it raw and cooked it thoroughly I turned out okay. I vomited a few times trying to make dinner one night then gave up. \n\nHonestly, she could have said \"we'll stop by after everything is cooked but may need to leave if my pregnancy symptoms flare up. Is it possible for me to nap in a separate room?\" But no, she went overboard.", "NTA. If I was in her position I would feel uncomfortable having a list of demands that doesn't consider everyone else. Like suppose everyone else wants poultry and alcohol? You also made a compromise to try to accommodate her and she wasn't having it. Seems a little selfish to me. I understand she is pregnant but she can still be considerate.", "NTA. She is incredibly entitled and is just being ridiculous. I'm honestly surprised anyone sided with her.", "Holy shit, your SIL is beyond entitled. You are absolutely NTA!!", "NTA. I\u2019m currently pregnant as well and have a lot of food aversions, but I don\u2019t expect any catering to my crazy hormones outside of my own home. She could have just apologized if she has to step away from things that cause her nausea and sit in another room or declined your invitation.", "NTA. There is no need to make a amends to someone's ridiculous request. She was literally requesting that everyone be as miserable as she is just because she made the choice to get pregnant. You offered reasonable accommodations of making her an alternative meal and not drinking at the table. She wanted it to be her way or nothing at all. It's fine if her husband wants to give into childish behavoir but no one else should. I also love how your brother pointed out that you were ruining their Thanksgiving by not agreeing to do what she wanted, but failed to acknowledge that she was ruining yours and the rest of the family with her unreasonable request. If this is how she behaves while pregnant I hate to see how she will be as mom. She will probably be one of those parents who feels every family functions has to revolved around their pressures little angel.", "NTA. Being pregnant can really suck, but her demands weren't reasonable, and being pregnant isn't a carte blanche for everyone to bend to your every whim. \n\nI had some serious food aversions and lots of fatigue when I was pregnant. And I dealt with it mainly by changing what *I* did or asking (not demanding) slight accommodations that wouldn't inconvenience anyone. The smell of lettuce made me gag, so when I went to my salad-obsessed MIL's for a holiday meal I made sure I was sitting at the other end of the table from where the salad was. I genuinely needed naps so I took them before or after family events, and if I was too tired for family games I simply didn't participate. The smell of strong alcohol was really off-putting, so I did ask my husband not to drink cognac while sitting right next to me, but I did not say \"nobody in the house can drink anything\".", "NTA, they could have hosted themselves. Being pregnant doesn\u2019t make the world revolve around them. You were willing to compromise and they weren\u2019t, and thanksgiving isn\u2019t solely about them, it\u2019s for everyone.", "NTA - you offered very sweet compromises and she refused. You did not exclude her, she had a tantrum and excluded herself. If she had so many demands then she and your brother could have offered to host and put the effort into meeting all of her ridiculous demands.", "INFO: was the turkey already prepared two weeks in advance? Because you could\u2019ve frozen it and used at Christmas (ETA: or any other event; Turkey is good frozen up to a year). Pregnancy super smell usually abates further into pregnancy. \n\nDid you research alternatives to turkey? A lot of folks use ham and/or a seafood boil.\n\nWhat did the other family members think?", "NTA. The world doesn't just bend to you because you are pregnant. Expecting 9 other people to go without everything they normally have is outrageous behaviour. The entitlement is mind blowing. She could have napped while everyone ate, thus avoiding the smell of Turkey. And she could have participated from a sotting position or just spectated on the games. As far as the alcohol goes, if she sits not near anyone while they srink she'd be fine. There were so many compromises she could have made instead of trying to make everyone accommodate her. Being pregnant doesn't mean you get to be a jackass.\n\nYou wait till the kid comes - this one is going to have her own section in entitled parents, mark my words \ud83d\ude12\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44", "NTA. It\u2019ll be fun to see all the demands they have to accommodate new mom Becky & their special little one.", "NTA.\n\nOk, it took me a minute to stop laughing, because this is one of the most ridiculous situations. Sigh. You\u2019re not the AH. Being pregnant does not entitle a person to upend an entire family event. She should have just said she couldn\u2019t come this year, instead of sending a runner off demands. NO.\n\nI have never expected people to treat me special, nor to alter their lives, because I was with child. Most folks wouldn\u2019t dare! So entitled.
