If she burnt your SIM card without hearing your reason for being late, it's not fair since you were just walking your girl-friends home at late night when area was not very safe for them.", "This is a literal mess.", "NTA. Is there something missing to this story, though?", "NTA - you help some girls and your mom burns your property? Not right at all, your mom sounds like she has some very big issues to think that's appropriate. Still, 10pm is late for your age", "NTA.. sounds like mom has her own issues to deal with that have nothing to do with you. I would of been proud of my son for being a gentleman in the way that you were with your lady friends. Plus I track my kids with their phones so I would never take the device that lets me know where my child is at all times.", "YTA. You had a phone but didn\u2019t call mom to explain you were going to be late, and why. \nYour own fault", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
