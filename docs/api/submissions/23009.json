It just means you had rich parents who could afford to travel internationally several times a year.\u201d (I grew up poor, (literally) worked my ass off in high school, got a full ride merit scholarship, and did everything humanly possible to land my current 6-figure job.

Where people who had to drop out of school to help support their family might see it? Check your privilege if you think you had none whatsoever; there\u2019s always someone who can have less.

It's just an excuse to chat about things that are not work related. In these cases, it's normal to mention something peculiar. It happened many times with people I met or during get togethers. People would mention how many languages they speak (if it's a strange number), the number of countries they have been to, or if they ate something new. They would mention if they had spent the holidays somewhere fancy (because maybe it was new to them or they were excited), or if they practice a sport the majority of people don't know. It's not bragging, it's just talking about something that you know would make other people curious and can be a topic of discussion instead of just \"work sucks\", more work talk, or empty pleasantries. \n\nAnd it's not true that it doesn't say anything about him as a person. It says that maybe he comes from money (his parents could work for airlines, in that case you don't need to be that rich); that he is a curious person because if he mentioned this, it means that he thinks it's something worth mentioning. People who take trips for granted usually don't mention them, he probably enjoys these trips. He's young in a new work place, he was probably trying to chat with his co-workers about stuff not related to work, trips are usually a pretty safe topic. \n\nHe was just talking, but you sulked to the point that he noticed and felt the need to ask you why you were being so quiet.

You were born on the third base of the academic game just by luck of your genetics. You kept running to home plate, but you didn\u2019t work harder than others who wanted to go to college. Get off it. \n\nI watched my friends struggle with flash cards and study  guides and study groups and all nighters. I literally woke up a hour before the test, after a party, and aced it.

It's called professionalism. \n\nYou don't have to be excited for them. You don't have to fake interest either.
