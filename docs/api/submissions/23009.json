It just means you had rich parents who could afford to travel internationally several times a year.\u201d (I grew up poor, (literally) worked my ass off in high school, got a full ride merit scholarship, and did everything humanly possible to land my current 6-figure job.

Travel *is* a luxury and for a lot of adults, it's something they aspire to do but in limited quantities. \n\n**But**, travelling to a 150 countries is not insignificant and means that your colleague likely went to places that were not luxurious. People who travel like Jack are people who have likely have a curiousity about the world and about other cultures and that's nothing to slight. It does say something about him as a person. \n\nYou also know next to nothing about how he was able to afford to conduct all of this travel. I grew up travelling across Europe, Asia and parts of Latin America and my family was by no means rich, but my mom worked for an airline and that massively alleviated the burden of travel costs. \n\nYour jealousy got the best of you in this situation. You worked hard, no one can or will ever take that away from you, but you do need to come to a place of resolution that people who grew up even moderately wealthy can also work hard too.\n\nEdit to add: I see a lot of people saying that Jack couldn't have travelled to this magnitude of countries while being curious about cultures, and while I agree that it is likely that not every single one of his trips were a cultural experience, people do not travel to that magnitude without some desire to see where other people live and some culture touchstones. And in terms of cost, I think a lot of people are forgetting that other countries in other parts of the world are much more accessible than what you experience if you're departing every single time from America. Jack could have gone away for a month in Europe and ticked off a number of countries, some of which he may have more invested interest in than others.", "You're fine.

You are. \n\nHis visiting 150 countries doesn't detract from your accomplishments. It's not a competition. It was light-hearted bar conversation. Sure, money was obviously a factor, but it doesn't sound like he was trying to make out like he was *better* than you because he got do something you didn't.

You are biased. \n\n>Rich people who think they\u2019re better than everyone else just because they had rich parents is a HUGE pet peeve of mine.\n\nHe simply said that he got to visit 150 countries. It doesn't mean he thinks he's better than other people. You were all out drinking and he shared this achievement. 150 countries are a lot and it can be a topic of conversation. It's just an excuse to chat about things that are not work related. In these cases, it's normal to mention something peculiar. It happened many times with people I met or during get togethers. People would mention how many languages they speak (if it's a strange number), the number of countries they have been to, or if they ate something new. They would mention if they had spent the holidays somewhere fancy (because maybe it was new to them or they were excited), or if they practice a sport the majority of people don't know. It's not bragging, it's just talking about something that you know would make other people curious and can be a topic of discussion instead of just \"work sucks\", more work talk, or empty pleasantries. \n\nAnd it's not true that it doesn't say anything about him as a person. It says that maybe he comes from money (his parents could work for airlines, in that case you don't need to be that rich); that he is a curious person because if he mentioned this, it means that he thinks it's something worth mentioning. People who take trips for granted usually don't mention them, he probably enjoys these trips. He's young in a new work place, he was probably trying to chat with his co-workers about stuff not related to work, trips are usually a pretty safe topic. \n\nHe was just talking, but you sulked to the point that he noticed and felt the need to ask you why you were being so quiet.

A lot of poor countries are dependent on tourism. But this tourism is also not really giving them anything for the kindness of their heart. They are usually exploited and a lot of common tourist spots have huge trouble with dealing with the climate change. I find it weird how every comment is talking about jealousy and nobody is even thinking about the damage this amount of travelling is doing to the environment. A lot of so-called poor countries are struggling because climate change made extreme weather phenomena more likely. \nAlso, look how countries like Bali or even Hawaii are struggling because tourism is basically draining all the resources so the locals have to spend a lot of money to even survive. Or the Italian city of Venice.\n\nI don't know what to tell you but criticizing someone for travelling to 150 countries and seeing it as an achievement isn't immediately a sign for jealousy. I can't think how someone can do that in the current financial situation and climate without exploitation. \n\nAlso, I assume with visiting he means staying there for at least a few days.

But it\u2019s not a terrible response to a person who won\u2019t let it drop, either. \n\nAnd yes, it is possible that something else is going on (Jack\u2019s parents are dirt-poor global missionaries), which may have made the OP\u2019s comment more hurtful. But the fact that Jack didn\u2019t say \u201cdude you have it all wrong, I only got to do all this travel because I worked for a shipping company and hauled pallets on and off ships around the world\u201d or something suggests to me that the OP may have been right, and Jack has never had to grapple with this before. \n\n\u201cCheck your privilege\u201d is such an obnoxious cliche now and I would never say that to someone, but as someone who *did* grow up pretty privileged and went to an undergrad surround by people who were even more privileged, I did have to learn that my privilege existed.

If he was really concerned about what was wrong, he wouldn't have been concerned as to why you weren't \"joining in\" on feigned interest in his escapades.
