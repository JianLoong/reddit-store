None of that is anybody\u2019s fault.\n\nBut the fact that you are basically prioritizing your dog over your SIL just rubs me the wrong way.

I understand your frustration because this is the dogs home and you\u2019re basically being asked to get rid of the dog and kick him out of his own home for the holidays.. which is cruel to the dog and rude for Sylvia to ask you to do that. \n\nThe other option is for them to stay at a hotel or other accommodation for the visit and visit during the day and you can put your dog in another room.

Get triggered every single time a dog is around?", "Totally fine to say \"I adopted the dog.\" Adding in the \"you\" part makes this ESH for me, bordering on Y T A.", "What does she do in public?? Run every time she sees a dog? Get triggered every time she sees a dog?  If anything.. she\u2019s the one doing the weaponizing.", "My point is he\u2019s still a dog, not a human who\u2019s married to your brother", "How can you put the comfort of an animal over the safety of a human being who is your family\u2026would you behave the same if it was your parents or if your brothers kids are allergic to dogs will you just tell them to never come to your house\u2026.that dog will die in 10-20years but your family will be with you for the rest of your hopefully long life. YTA", "That is a her problem, you stepped up to host in an unfortunate situation, they will need to find some other place to stay. It sounds a bit harsh, but it isn't a situation you, or your dog, created, you are dealing with it the best you can. Maybe you can all chip in for a hotel or Airbnb? then she can be nearby, participate in the festivities and at least have a place she feels safe to sleep. Keep the dog gated in the kitchen when she is around?\n\nIs Sylvia doing anything to get over her fear? any kind of therapy or anything? It is hard to go through life without having to at least occasionally interact with dogs.", "Personally, I think you need to apologize to her, but also hold firm to your position on the dog.", "You should put this in the description. That it\u2019s a few days matters a great deal.", "I would add this as an edit to your OP, someone else is asking the same thing.", "My parents are uncomfortable with my pets - the parents stay in a hotel near by and come over for meals and to spend time. It may be an option for meeting conflicting needs. Also is SiL offering to pay kennel fees (which are probably booked solid by now) or is she expecting OP to pay a large amount of money for the pleasure of her company?", "Did you say \u201cI adopted my dog, not you\u201d while conscious of her foster care? Because you were upset, in the heat of the moment?\n\nIt matters a great deal in terms of whether you are TA.", "I have seen a rescue who is fine around \"most people\" as long as you weren't a large man or wearing high vis clothing. So basically the dog can have triggers just like how OP SIL is triggered. Part of rescuing a pet is identifying and working on those triggers just like how humans go to therapy to do the same thing.\n\nThe dog I met took time and eventually warmed up to my dad who fit both triggers but she realised he was a safe person through regular contact and how he treated her during that contact and for her it became a \"case by case\" sort of issue for her family.", "I can see why that would make even barking scary. Waiting for something to happen can be worse than the actual event. But it is still competing needs and no easy answers. If you board, you set a dangerous precedent. Think hotel would be best option.", "It\u2019s not unreasonable that she's terrified of dogs then. I don't think you should have to kennel your dog, I think there are other options that could / should be tried.\n\nBut YTA for \"the vague story\" (do you not believe her?) and for your choice of words. I understand you say didn't intend to hurt her but you did. You were thoughtless at best and should apologize.", "I\u2019ve edited the post to include it", "lmao", "You forgot the large, aggressive and not socialized part of the issue.", "He\u2019s a dog that is my responsibility to look after, and I take that seriously. I don\u2019t have a responsibility to look after Sylvia. She has a responsibility to look after herself, not expect everyone else to accommodate her", "It\u2019s the dog\u2019s house, not Sylvia\u2019s. She can go stay at a hotel or Air BnB. Displacing the dog that lives there is not right. And it\u2019s also not fair to the dog.", "That\u2019s a good solution. I\u2019d apologize too for making it seem I was referring to her childhood situation but it was not meant that way\u2026", "I agree. Add this to the edit.", "No she wasn\u2019t offering to pay", "I knew about her foster care situation, but I wasn\u2019t intended to reference it with my comment. I was trying to be like, \u201cI adopted my dog but no one adopted you you\u2019re evil\u201d, I was saying \u201cI adopted this dog which means he is my responsibility and my priority, not you\u201d. I would have said the same thing regardless of her background, so no I didn\u2019t say it because I was angry to be an AH", "I believe her, I meant I kept it purposely vague by not detailing what happened.", "True. I did. But the question remains what does she do in public? Freak out every time a large dog is around? I don\u2019t not mean to sounds rude or anything but there\u2019s various things to think here.", "Kind of like I adopted my dog and my brother \"adopted\" SIL therefore your responsibility is to your dog and the only one's responsible for SIL is her self and your brother sort of comment.", "He didn\u2019t adopt her, he married her. But yes, I have a responsibility for my dog and as an adult she has responsibility for herself", "That's why I put it in quotation marks. You brought your dog into the family by adopting it. Your brother brought your sil into the family by marrying her."]}
