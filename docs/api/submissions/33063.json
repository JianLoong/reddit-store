None of that is anybody\u2019s fault.\n\nBut the fact that you are basically prioritizing your dog over your SIL just rubs me the wrong way.

I understand your frustration because this is the dogs home and you\u2019re basically being asked to get rid of the dog and kick him out of his own home for the holidays.. which is cruel to the dog and rude for Sylvia to ask you to do that. \n\nThe other option is for them to stay at a hotel or other accommodation for the visit and visit during the day and you can put your dog in another room.

Moving the celebrations to Sylvia and your brother's house could *possibly* work, dependent on your parent's attitudes and the size of their place, but you'd have to leave the dog at home, and that's not much different that having him kenneled.\n\nAll-in-all, I hope Sylvia and your brother skip the family gathering to go to Cabo and the rest of you have a lovely time together and your dog doesn't maul anyone, since he doesn't like men or anyone getting near you.", "YTA for what you said", "\u201cThe dog is fine with most people.\u201d Meaning the dog is not fine with everyone all the time.

Not just because of her background, but because it's worded in such a hostile manner. You don't come off as a very kind, compassionate person. Instead of \"I adopted this dog, not YOU!\" You could have said something like, \"I made a committment to this pup, and I feel like putting him in a kennel would be detrimental to him.

Was the dog going to accompany you? Was there an issue with that? \n\nThat said, I am going to say this; 1) I agree with not boarding the dog at this time. I don't know how much it's spread, but in a few states there's a dog illness that's unresponsive to meds and quickly turning into pneumonia and even killing dogs. Top that off with your dog not yet being adjusted and socialized, there's not enough time to find a kennel, and get him used to being boarded. \n\nThat said I'm struggling with a verdict. I want to go no assholes here. Because you on the reason above and having tried to find multiple solutions to the problem, neither of those things are asshole. They're reasonable. And on the SIL's side, if there's trauma and triggers, being in the same house as a dog, it is going to be hard, and if she isn't in therapy working on it, she should. Big dogs are in public areas, and it's something she should work on for her own fear and comfort. But also, therapy isn't cheap, so it isn't always that simple.\n\nThe reason I struggle to give the full no assholes here verdict, is your tone. You're talking down about her, and are dismissive of her struggle. Yes, you're trying to find a solution, but it feels more like if I walked into somewhere and ordered something that normally has sour cream without it, and you as the employee have just rolled your eyes thinking i'm picky. When in truth, while I'm not allergic, Sour cream triggers my gag reflex so violently I will borderline puke if I eat it. Yeah, you're accommodating it, but you're doing reluctantly without any understand or empathy for the situation.\n\nAnd you're also being dismissive of the comment you made. No, you did not intend it that way, but intentions mean nothing. They are personal to you. But they do nothing themselves. And just because you didn't ***mean*** for it it be taken that way, doesn't mean it's unreasonable that she ***did*** take it that way. It's easy to see how that comment could have been meant that way by someone who actively wanted to hurt her. Yes you have a responsibility to your dog. But you do also have a responsibility to family, even if they just married in. And a little bit of empathy goes a long way. \n\nThat said, I would suggest the following compromise; 1) Do apologize for the remark. Again, just because you didn't ***mean*** it that way, doesn't mean it's unreasonable she took it that way. And she's hurt, and those feelings are valid here. An apology for a comment that was careless, will not hurt you. 2) research hotels near you for cost. Give her the information so she can stay at a hotel as a compromise. She can sleep at night because she won't have a dog sharing the house with her. And when she's over you'll keep the dog separate. That at this time, it's just not feasible to board the dog. There's too many risks, and there'd be a chance of you having to pick up the dog anyway. And perhaps shorten the trip if needed.", "YTA, even if accidentally so.

Like other people have pointed out, what does she do if she's sitting in her house and someone walks a dog by on the street outside her window? Or if she has a window open and hears distant barking? If she expects dogs to somehow be completely inperceivable to her at all times, that's not reasonable, that's a phobia, and by definition is irrational\n\nKeeping the dog physically away so her fear of being bitten is completely impossible is reasonable. To expect all dogs to functionally not exist is not. \n\nAlso in terms of the wording, it's common to say you adopted the dog. Dos SIL expect nobody to ever utter the word \"adopt\" in her presence? Again, not reasonable. NTA", "OP is def NTA, but an apology about the phrasing wouldn't go amiss.

For OP, it's about her dog. Of course OP should maintain shelter for her *dog* so not TA there.

They're completely ignoring any comment that focuses on the use of the word adoption after their first few responses. \n\nThey are still commenting, but this as one of the top responses they've avoided entirely. So why? Because it identifies the use of the word adopted as problematic in this situation. \n\nI don't think that was used accidentally or just to refer to the dog given that they're avoiding this. I think it was intentional and OP doesn't want to talk about it because they can't think of a way to excuse it. They tried earlier on but once people insisted it was obviously the breakdown they started ignoring that question. They were trying to make her angry I'm thinking based on that.\n\nThis is firmly YTA based on that I think. Not AH because she's protecting her dog, but that OP intentionally caused the fight in the family.", "This is an extremely reasonable take, thank you.", "I agree except I think its ESH. \n\nThe issue here is that the two parties, OP and Sylvia haven't phrased anything they have said well. \n\nThe issue is Sylvia is demanding, and OP is getting rubbed the wrong way about it. \n\nSo now they are both prickly. \n\nIts not exactly a difficult problem to solve, both parties can make concessions and work something out. Its just 100% about how they spoke to each other. \n\nI tend to side more with OP though. I wouldn't rehome my pets for days, because that would make me anxious and upset.

I have friends who don't like kids. Should my SIL, who lives with me, banish her children to a daycare whenever those friends want to visit? No, that would be absurd and even those friends would agree. There is a middle ground here that lets everybody exist in comfort, and Sylvia's not willing to step anywhere near it.

Really it may not even be the dog is so important, it's just a way to assert herself and not compromise bc it's her house. The attempts to make a solid plan for keeping the dog safely separate in the house are wishy washy, it sounds like \"eh, whatever, it's not possible anyway.\" \n\nI agree strongly that there will be consequences in future family relationships, even if not immediate. If I was your brother or SIL, I would not attend. Cut the weekend celebration to just one day and go somewhere outside of the house.

Relationships aren't a right though and you're putting them in serious jeopardy with your attitude.\n\nEDIT bc automod removes any further comment I make. I understand the cost issue but I just don't believe there's not a way to keep the dog comfortably separate on the property for a few days. It's also why I just wouldn't go, bc even if it's not fair for them to pay dog lodging, I'm not paying $1,000 either for a hotel bc my sister can't be bothered to separate her dog while family holiday is happening.\n\nThe SIL probably has anxiety about it that's hard to reach her through and explain various options, but I also highly doubt OP put any real thought or effort into an alternate plan, and doesn't sound like someone you can trust in good faith to care about a person's comfort or well being. SIL didn't feel safe at OPs home and OP minimized it so naturally wouldn't be trustworthy for compromise.\n\nI basically agree with and said, just come up w a new plan and arrangement for how this year will go.

I was surprised how long I had to scroll to find 1st YTA post. Sounds to me like SIL has a legit reason to ask for the dog to be not around her. I don't think I will ever understand how some people put dogs needs above people needs. I'm not saying dogs needs can be ignored, but in cases like this one, oh come on. Reeks of complete lack of empathy, insensitivity and entitlement. What were they going to do with the dog if the celebrations would happen at parents home like initially planned? sounds to me like  the would have been some kind of dog solution for this, what can't this be done also in these new circumstances.

OP is digging their heels in.", "Yeah there\u2019s a couple factors that lead me to say ESH too\n\nApparently this dog is a wolf hybrid and has a history of snapping and growling. I feel like OP should\u2019ve included more info like that (not that I think the dog is evil for that, growling is communication but snapping is an escalation warning and this is important context as to why Sil might feel unsafe) Hybrids are known for being temperamental and unstable around people because wolf genetics complicate things and are often surrendered to rescues or dumped for a reason. Many professionals are against the breeding of them and OP suggests that it\u2019s a probably from a backyard breeding situation, so definitely not stable genetics and even well adjusted dogs can struggle with the holidays  because of how hectic, loud, and different everything is so I\u2019m wondering if this wolf hybrid is really going to be ok to have around while holiday activities are going on even if they\u2019re put away. \n\nAnd while OP says the growling and snapping is \u201cmisplaced protection instincts\u201d from what I\u2019ve researched professionals now know dogs not be pack animals and instead exist in fission-fusion groups and would call this resource guarding or reactivity, not a protection instinct (but I\u2019m not a professional so grain of salt obviously) and OP seems confident in this wild animal hybrid because they\u2019ve owned rescues before and are using a trainer ( I think the qualifications and education of that trainer are also important context here tbh since anyone can call themselves a trainer and start to give advice out but props to OP for using a trainer regardless) but this is different than a fully domesticated rescue dog, it\u2019s a wolf hybrid with extremely questionable genetics and background and I can kind of see why SIL is this on edge about being in the same household with this animal. I\u2019ve seen a dog that chewed through a door to get out of a room, I\u2019ve been around dogs that seem fine and then go from zero to a hundred because of certain triggers or poor training that backfires so that\u2019s another factor as to why SIL might be uncomfortable. \n\nMy thoughts on this are that overall it\u2019s not a black and white scenario and while I think OP isn\u2019t necessarily completely in the wrong or a Gillian for thinking of the animal that they\u2019re taking responsibility for I still think OP has handled this poorly and left out very important context in the post but I think everyone is so pro dog they\u2019re automatically assuming SIL is doing this just to be an asshole and not out of legitimate fear of this animal", "It's multiple days tho not like 5 hours that's pretty fucked up to just leave a dog in a room for that long.

If you were going to board in that situation, I can see why Sylvia would have thought you would consider boarding when she stayed over.  \n\n\nYou are NTA for not boarding your dog.  I do think you were a bit obtuse with regard to the specific \"adoption\" comment, and that sounds like your actual question.  If I were you I'd apologize for my unintentionally hurtful phrasing re adoption, but not give in re the boarding.  \"What I was trying to say was that I have a responsibility to my dog, and boarding is not right for him, and I have to respect that, but I was very wrong to refer to adoption in the way that I did, and I am very sorry I hurt you.\"", "And what about the other neighborhood dogs?

Aging out of foster care, to a lot of people in the system, means no one wanted you and you were shuffled from place to place, some of which may have been nice, some of which were okay, and some of which were bad. You constantly had to learn new rules for new places or risk being moved again. Owning stuff often wasn't really possible as a result, and so you may have only had a bag of clothes, maybe a few books or a toy or stuffed animal or something.\n\nThat's deeply, profoundly traumatizing. Then imagine finally finding family, only to be told right before Christmas that A DOG was more wanted and important than you. The dog got adopted. You didn't. And somebody pointed that out, even if it was a really clumsy, awful choice of words. That's definitely triggering.\n\nAnd I feel for OP here too - I used to raise, foster, and rescue Great Danes which, and I think most people would agree, are big dogs. I dealt with dogs that had TERRIBLE separation anxiety and engaged in TREMENDOUSLY destructive behavior as a direct result. I grew up with a rescue dog that had been abused by a man and was terrified of me, even though I was a kid. Bringing a dog back from that kind of trauma - if it's even possible - is hard, labor-intensive work.\n\nAnd if you suggest that my cats aren't part of my family or that I should rid of them due to behavioral issues, as one rando did during a gaming session one night? My anger and volume both go WELL beyond 11.\n\nThis entire situation is sad all around. I feel bad for OP's brother's wife. I feel bad for OP. I feel bad for OP's dog, and understand why kenneling isn't an option. This is a shitty situation, and all I can say with certainty is that OP owes sister-in-law a huge, heart-felt apology to try to repair damage done there acknowledging that her thoughtless words were EXTREMELY hurtful, if OP actually cares about family relations.

I have ptsd and prolonged grief disorder (both diagnosed) from a really traumatic miscarriage (pregnancy after years of trying lost in April 2020 so it was the trauma of loss plus fear of going to the ER at the height of Covid). This year at Thanksgiving, my BIL reached out to my husband to let us know that he and his wife would be announcing a pregnancy.

I\u2019m learning to deal with my trauma and how to properly survive unexpected triggers. For me, that means I will shut off in the moment until I feel safe enough to feel the emotions.

If I touch the pets, I simply go wash my hands before touching anything else. Sometimes it's also not the dander it's the saliva, but you can remedy the dander allergy by feeding your pets a brand of dry food that contains a specific egg protein found in chickens born around cats. It basically neutralizes the gene that most people are allergic to. It takes like a month, and obviously I don't think you should fuck with your pets diet to accomodate a visitor, but there are several things people with allergies can do to be around dogs and cats with little to no problems. If it is a severe allergy that can kill you, you wouldn't be staying anywhere that housed a dog regardless, and while you can ask for basic accommodations, you still would not have the right to tell someone they need to board their animals (which is generally traumatizing for said animals) so that you can stay somewhere. You are a person who should know what allergies you have and how they affect you in certain situations.

A dog that snaps at people simply because of their gender or unfamiliarity is one that is not safe to be around unless crated and/or muzzled until trained. End of story.

This is an unfortunate situation, but your actions went too far.

Putting aside all of the other horrifying things she likely endured in the system, this is incredibly traumatic. Even if she doesn't have PTSD it would be completely understandable that the presence, or barking, of an aggressive dog could absolutely wreck her. And if she does have something like PTSD, this would definitely bring nightmares, flashbacks, and other symptoms. Her request is reasonable under this situation. \n\nTwo: Your dog is definitely aggressive and wouldn't be a good addition to a family celebration even if nobody was scared of dogs. You mention in the post that they are \"in training\" and reactive to men. Clarifying in the comments that you rescued them from another country and had challenges bring them over because of their breed, which is German Shepard, Husky, and part wolf! Any dog that is part wolf is going to be a very dangerous animal that requires dedication and immense efforts to keep the dog and those around it safe. This is a dog anyone might reasonably fear, and your SIL especially. \n\nThree: Possibly worst off, your comment about adopting the dog and not her is just cruel given the entirety of her history. You need to sincerely apologize and try and make things right with her. No matter what your intent was when you said it. \n\nI hope you see this and try to make things right. I don't know your family's situation, but explore alternatives. Maybe the dog can stay at the friend who was going to watch them's place? Maybe you can afford to rent out a vacation home to stay in? Get a hotel for brother and sister in law? Perhaps rework holiday plans completely this year and do separate visits and a nice meal out together?

I have 2 small dogs, one of.my best friends has trauma that makes it so she is unable to be around dogs. We used to host them every Thanksgiving, but after her trauma she can't come anymore.\n\nIt's just a sad situation, but I care about my friend and would NEVER say \"well, I adopted my dog, not you.\" OVER MESSAGING EVEN!

You also 'vaguely' know that your SIL was in a foster home that used aggressive dogs to punish the foster children. \n\nNow that we have that all straight: the casual dismissal of your SIL's actual trauma, the comment that clearly was offensive, and how you've minimized *how bad your dog's behavior actually is,* AND the size and breed of your dog just screams a weird entitlement and/or nativity about your dog and a lack of empathy toward the woman your brother has vowed to love and honor.\n\nI love all the friend shaped creatures that allow us to love on them, but you are putting a dog that is clearly not ready to have guests in your home trump an actual human being with real trauma (again, that you are minimizing for brownie points in this sub).\n\nFrankly, you should decline to host the holiday and apologize for the comment. True, it's not fair to board the dog when they are still in need of so much rehabilitation (or to the boarding employees for that matter), but it's also not fair to the SIL because of her very real trauma.", "YTA. I\n\u2019d like to know what type of dog this is?  How long have YOU had the dog?  \nHow old is the dog?  Is he a puppy? Or adult?\n\nHow can you say YOU are responsible for the safety of those around the dog - which you absolutely are - but in the same breath say you have no responsibility for Sylvia??? \n\nHow can you know Sylvia was traumatized as a child by dogs while in foster care and NOT take that into consideration?? Do you have no empathy at all???\n\nYou say the dog has snapped at other people and you are working on retraining him?  Just for this reason, I would question the intelligence of having the dog around anyone just yet. How long/ much retraining has he had and what is his progress ?\n\nI don\u2019t think you should have to board the dog, and while I agree it\u2019s your house and your dog, I think you need to step back and look at the danger you are putting not only Sylvia in emotionally, but everyone going to be in the house physically with an aggressive, unstable dog. That\u2019s a lot of people around a dog that has issues. (Snapping at people is aggression even if he is trying to warn.)\n\nI also agree with that you comment regarding adoption was rude and shows you just don\u2019t like you SIL. With the comments you made, of course she doesn\u2019t feel welcome. I wouldn\u2019t blame her and brother for not coming. \n\nPerhaps it would be better for a different plan all around. \n\nAnd with all this , I LOVE dogs.", " If she's legit terrified of your dog, YTA.

I LOVE dogs (we've fostered over 60 and have three of our own!), but I absolutely loathe folks who shrug off a growling, anxious, glowering dog as \"we're working on it\" or \"he usually won't bite\" as others skirt around the edges of room, worried about getting snapped at or bit. Being responsible for your dog includes making sure he's not put in situations where he may lash out in fear, not just taking a \"it's his house, deal with it\" attitude.\n\nThe fact that she has negative experiences with dogs is relevant, but that's not really The Point, here-- it's that your dog is not comfortable with guests, and you're angry your guests aren't okay with that. I wouldn't want to come to your house either, frankly, because I don't want to spend holidays worrying I might startle a nervous dog (at a time when the dog is probably already on edge due to decorations/parents/holiday routine changes) and get bit.\n\nAlso? It sounds like you're forcing your dog into situations that make him anxious and uncomfortable because you want him to feel included in the holiday.

However, I don't think that meeting would have happened at all if such a situation were to last for days.\n\nPoint of the story?

The message basically being the dog's comfort ultimately ranks higher in OP's life than hers, which is fair. \nThey've been trying to compromise by offering to keep the dog away from her but it's still too much. At that point the natural conclusion is \"then the SIL can't stay in this house\" not \"guess we should yeet away our beloved dog who is a core family member to an uncertain, unfamiliar environment for a couple of days\".

She knows not to jump on people, and not to invade people's personal space unless invited. She knows not to beg for food (she only gets some leftover human food in her dish when she's good and doesn't beg, so she knows that leaving us alone while we eat is the best way to get what she wants).\n\nI've put a lot of work into her so that she can be 100% trusted with people, and that includes stepping on paws and pulling ears so that I know she won't instinctively snap in an encounter with a clumsy toddler.\n\nShe's a German shepherd, and is capable of doing serious damage if she were to attack someone.
