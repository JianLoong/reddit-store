She is paralyzed from the waist down. We moved in with her to take care of her. It was a big decision. I ended up selling my house and quitting a job in order to make my boyfriend happy, which was not seeing his mother go into a nursing home. Her now ex husband moved out because he no longer wanted the responsibility of caring for her. \n\nI am now a full-time SAHM and also the full-time caretaker of his mother. I do most of the cleaning, all the cooking, grocery shopping, taking care of the kids, bathing and clothing the kids, and of course, taking care of his mom. \n\nWe have a back-up aide that comes 1-2 days a week. We mainly keep her just in case we need to leave for a night or so. \n\nLately my boyfriend and I have been arguing about household chores. He works for USPS and he usually works about 6 days a week. The latest he\u2019s gone is between 5-6pm. Normally he gets home between 3-4pm. My boyfriend apparently doesn\u2019t have the ability to look around the house and see what needs done. He\u2019s insisting I \u201cjust tell him\u201d or \u201cjust ask.\u201d But here\u2019s the thing: I hate asking. For a few reasons.

Or says \u201cI\u2019ll do it later,\u201d and will instead play a video game. And then said task doesn\u2019t get done for a few more days. \n\nI understand he has days when he\u2019s tired and doesn\u2019t want to do anything, and I certainly have those days as well.

There's a video I saw a long time back that I can't find now, it explains the concept of mental load of housework by comparing it to work in an office setting. It explained that managing a household has \n\n- an administrative component, like anticipating needs and workload, planning, scheduling and organizing then, like a manager in an office. \n\n- an executive component of physically doing those tasks like going to the store, cooking and cleaning, what subordinates do according to how the manager envisions it. \n\nIn most households even today, the mental load of administrative housework is left up to women and men may share 50% of physical load. It's unequal and unfair, and you won't be the ah to ask him to step up and be a true equal partner.\n\nEdit: it's not a video but a comic.

I\u2019m sorry you are dealing with a lot! Kids are a lot on their own but being a care giver is HUGE! You MUST learn to ask for help. As his mom gets older it it going to get tougher. It may not be your nature to ask for help, but if you don\u2019t it will certainly fracture your relationship, due to resentment and anger building up. While he should get it, and jump in, it\u2019s obviously not going to happen. You need to sit down together and develop a cohesive plan on who does what when. So things are cut and dry, and no unmet expectations. Then, when you need help, be sure to ask. Also, is there respite care available or any agencies that can give you help? Care giving is a high burn out position for anyone. I wish you the best!", "NTA but there's a bit of E S H sneaking in here but it's mainly him (and some of that E S H is being an arse to yourself).\n\nWhat I've seen is that a lot of people need to be told what to do before they think of doing it.  It's like they are looking at something and just can't see that it needs doing ie the dishes, vacuuming, doing a load of washing.  They literally need to be told to do something.  Yes, there is a bit of weaponised incompetence if they comment.. but you do so much a better job than me, or, I didn't realise I needed to do that because you usually do that yourself and I know that you prefer it done a certain way etc.\n\nAlso, you hate to ask... Maybe your boyfriend hasn't realised that you aren't coping any more.  The kids may be older but they have different needs.. your MIL is probably getting worse and needs more care... but you've managed really well so far so he's thinking you are still managing like always.\n\nThere will also be a bit of 'If I put the blinders on and don't do anything.. I won't have to do anything.'  And the moaning and groaning and putting it off also often means that you'll end up doing it because you got sick of waiting.\n\nBasically you both need to communicate.  You really need to let him know that things need to change and you do need his help or you need to get help in to help care for his mother.\n\nBelieve me in that I know how you feel.  I have something similar at home.. but I don't have to care for a disabled person as well... so I let this slide.... no it's not ideal but it is what it is.\n\nBut something needs to change.  Remember that this is his mother that you are doing all the care for.  It's exhausting for you.  And it's mainly 24/7 for you even if you do get a aide for a few hours a day or two a week.\n\nDo you have the ability to get some respite care for your MIL?  This may mean she spends a couple of weeks in a nursing home or respite facility.  It will allow you to recharge your batteries.  Maybe coincide it with some holidays so you can get away from the house and really have a break.\n\nYou may have to look at other options for care for your MIL...  if nothing changes, then you will have a breakdown at some point which it shouldn't come to.  Your MIL may be the nicest person in the world but caring for her day in and day out is a lot and you do need a break.\n\nAlso remember that the kids are seeing what their dad is doing at home.", "NTA. Yes, he \\*should\\* just help. But he's not, and he doesn't see all the places you need help. Would you rather be right, in the weeds, and annoyed?

So, excluding the factor of the mom, if he is going to work and paying 100% of the bills and for the house, then you should be doing 100% of the housework. Now, the mom throws a big wrench in that idea. There's absolutely no way that everything should fall on you. But the point is that you cant expect him to read your mind. Men work very differently from women. Something that \"needs doing\" to you is something that is just fine how it is to him. Communicate more.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It doesn\u2019t mean you won\u2019t occasionally swap a load between washer & dryer - but you won\u2019t ever have to THINK about it. He will sort the load, get it started, and leave you a note asking you kindly to do the swap at midday, please. \n\nSo:\n\n- read the book\n\n- decide what you would like to handover to him first\n\n- approach him with a \u201cBe my hero\u201d vibe \n\n- let him fail, if necessary\n\n  - part of giving him ownership is letting him keep the ownership, even when you don\u2019t agree with what he\u2019s doing\n\n  - don\u2019t rescue him\n\n  - continue the \u201cbe my hero\u201d theme with \u201cI believe you can fix this\u201d support\n\n  - (obviously if he asks for your advice on how HE can fix it, then offer it - but don\u2019t be offended if he doesn\u2019t take it. Let him keep the responsibility.)\n\n- praise him for it, intermittently\n\n  - tell him he\u2019s succeeding in being your hero\n\n  - again, I\u2019ll get lots of replies saying that you shouldn\u2019t have to, he\u2019s an adult, etc.  That seems a sad way to live, for me. My partner & I constantly \u201cappreciate\u201d each other for the stuff we do. Because it\u2019s nice to have your efforts noticed. Especially when it\u2019s the boring everyday stuff. Choose to offer him praise - and then (separately) train him to give you praise for the small, everyday stuff. It\u2019s a good habit for you both to get into. \n\nOf course, all the above assumes he\u2019s a basically good man, who has just got into bad habits of leaving everything to you. If he\u2019s basically selfish, etc, then you probably won\u2019t get anywhere with this - but then you\u2019d have bigger problems anyway, so hopefully it\u2019s not that. \n\nGood luck.", "NTA- IT\"S HIS MOM!!!!!!

Being a caretaker to an adult is exhausting and extremely taxing mentally and emotionally. That's why nurses work in SHIFTS.

You are his free maid. If he's not married to you which would be a way to make your contribution recognized to a certain extent, and if he's not willing to participate in household chores, he should be the one taking care of his mom and you should be working. Then you would not be in danger as much and your life would be improved. Let him see if he wants that for himself and if he's not like his dad who abandoned his mom. Is there no legal status in your country to make it official that you are the mother's caretaker ? That would at least protect you a little bit (but probably not a lot). This is not going to work if it continues like this and you know it so you have to protect yourself in the likely eventuality he never changes."]}
