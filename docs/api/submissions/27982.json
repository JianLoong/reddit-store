She is paralyzed from the waist down. We moved in with her to take care of her. It was a big decision. I ended up selling my house and quitting a job in order to make my boyfriend happy, which was not seeing his mother go into a nursing home. Her now ex husband moved out because he no longer wanted the responsibility of caring for her. \n\nI am now a full-time SAHM and also the full-time caretaker of his mother. I do most of the cleaning, all the cooking, grocery shopping, taking care of the kids, bathing and clothing the kids, and of course, taking care of his mom. \n\nWe have a back-up aide that comes 1-2 days a week. We mainly keep her just in case we need to leave for a night or so. \n\nLately my boyfriend and I have been arguing about household chores. He works for USPS and he usually works about 6 days a week. The latest he\u2019s gone is between 5-6pm. Normally he gets home between 3-4pm. My boyfriend apparently doesn\u2019t have the ability to look around the house and see what needs done. He\u2019s insisting I \u201cjust tell him\u201d or \u201cjust ask.\u201d But here\u2019s the thing: I hate asking. For a few reasons. One being I feel like I shouldn\u2019t have to ask my partner to help clean. Two, whenever I do ask, he moans and groans about it. Sighs and rolls his eyes. Or says \u201cI\u2019ll do it later,\u201d and will instead play a video game. And then said task doesn\u2019t get done for a few more days. \n\nI understand he has days when he\u2019s tired and doesn\u2019t want to do anything, and I certainly have those days as well. But generally speaking, I feel like it shouldn\u2019t be this straining. \n\nAITA for saying I shouldn\u2019t need to ask for help?", "created_utc": 1696125547, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16wonqp/aita_for_telling_my_boyfriend_28_that_i_shouldnt/", "score": 36, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

There's a video I saw a long time back that I can't find now, it explains the concept of mental load of housework by comparing it to work in an office setting. It explained that managing a household has \n\n- an administrative component, like anticipating needs and workload, planning, scheduling and organizing then, like a manager in an office. \n\n- an executive component of physically doing those tasks like going to the store, cooking and cleaning, what subordinates do according to how the manager envisions it. \n\nIn most households even today, the mental load of administrative housework is left up to women and men may share 50% of physical load. It's unequal and unfair, and you won't be the ah to ask him to step up and be a true equal partner.\n\nEdit: it's not a video but a comic.

I\u2019m sorry you are dealing with a lot! Kids are a lot on their own but being a care giver is HUGE! You MUST learn to ask for help. As his mom gets older it it going to get tougher. It may not be your nature to ask for help, but if you don\u2019t it will certainly fracture your relationship, due to resentment and anger building up. While he should get it, and jump in, it\u2019s obviously not going to happen. You need to sit down together and develop a cohesive plan on who does what when. So things are cut and dry, and no unmet expectations. Then, when you need help, be sure to ask. Also, is there respite care available or any agencies that can give you help? Care giving is a high burn out position for anyone. I wish you the best!", "NTA but there's a bit of E S H sneaking in here but it's mainly him (and some of that E S H is being an arse to yourself).\n\nWhat I've seen is that a lot of people need to be told what to do before they think of doing it.  It's like they are looking at something and just can't see that it needs doing ie the dishes, vacuuming, doing a load of washing.  They literally need to be told to do something.  Yes, there is a bit of weaponised incompetence if they comment.. but you do so much a better job than me, or, I didn't realise I needed to do that because you usually do that yourself and I know that you prefer it done a certain way etc.\n\nAlso, you hate to ask... Maybe your boyfriend hasn't realised that you aren't coping any more.  The kids may be older but they have different needs.. your MIL is probably getting worse and needs more care... but you've managed really well so far so he's thinking you are still managing like always.\n\nThere will also be a bit of 'If I put the blinders on and don't do anything.. I won't have to do anything.'  And the moaning and groaning and putting it off also often means that you'll end up doing it because you got sick of waiting.\n\nBasically you both need to communicate.  You really need to let him know that things need to change and you do need his help or you need to get help in to help care for his mother.\n\nBelieve me in that I know how you feel.  I have something similar at home.. but I don't have to care for a disabled person as well... so I let this slide.... no it's not ideal but it is what it is.\n\nBut something needs to change.  Remember that this is his mother that you are doing all the care for.  It's exhausting for you.  And it's mainly 24/7 for you even if you do get a aide for a few hours a day or two a week.\n\nDo you have the ability to get some respite care for your MIL?  This may mean she spends a couple of weeks in a nursing home or respite facility.  It will allow you to recharge your batteries.  Maybe coincide it with some holidays so you can get away from the house and really have a break.\n\nYou may have to look at other options for care for your MIL...  if nothing changes, then you will have a breakdown at some point which it shouldn't come to.  Your MIL may be the nicest person in the world but caring for her day in and day out is a lot and you do need a break.\n\nAlso remember that the kids are seeing what their dad is doing at home.", "NTA. Yes, he \\*should\\* just help. But he's not, and he doesn't see all the places you need help. Would you rather be right, in the weeds, and annoyed? Or get help? \"I need\" statements are great here. \"I need you to make dinner.\" \"I need you to help the kids with their homework.\"", "[deleted]", "Write a list and put it on the fridge by days of the week. That's your long standing request.", "[deleted]", "YTA. He works a paying job so that you don't have to. Grow up.", "Men generally don't make these associations like you do. I also am a firm believer that any household work split should be the inverse of the monetary split in a relationship. So, excluding the factor of the mom, if he is going to work and paying 100% of the bills and for the house, then you should be doing 100% of the housework. Now, the mom throws a big wrench in that idea. There's absolutely no way that everything should fall on you. But the point is that you cant expect him to read your mind. Men work very differently from women. Something that \"needs doing\" to you is something that is just fine how it is to him. Communicate more.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
