We have been divorced for seven years now. We have 50/50 custody and she remarried so spousal support is done. \n\nHer new husband recently left her. I don't know, and am not interested, in the particulars. In my opinion he didn't seem like a terrible guy and he left her their house, once again I have no idea of debt load or anything like that. \n\nShe called me last week to see if I could please help her out with some food. She said that she had run through her budget for food for her and the kids and basically begged me to help her out. I asked her to give me a few minutes and I would call her back. \n\nI talked to my girlfriend, who lives with me, and we agreed that we could spare some food. We have a freezer full of elk, venison, and wild hog, as well as a well stocked pantry. We also have  beef, pork, and chicken. \n\nI called my ex back and told her to come by and pick up a big load of groceries. This is where it got weird. She said she didn't want groceries. She wanted me to give her money for Uber eats or something. \n\nI said no. I have two weeks worth of food that you can have. But I'm not giving you money for takeout. \n\nShe called me an asshole for expecting her to be grateful for my scraps. That I was expecting her to be all domestic. Everything I was going to give her was either frozen meat, canned veggies, fresh vegetables from the garden, and pasta/rice in unopened bags. I want my kids to eat well. Both of my kids hunt and my son, the older one, is a pretty good cook. He regularly makes meals for all of us at my house. Both kids eat game meat as well as store bought. \n\nI honestly thought I was doing what she asked. I told my girlfriend not to bother packing anything up. I texted both kids and told them to let me know if they were actually going hungry and I would take care of everything. \n\nBoth kids texted back and said there was food in the house it just needed to be prepared. Both of them also said that if I was willing to spare some of the elk and hog roasts they would take them. I laughed and said I would take them over later. \n\nMy ex however is telling everyone that I am trying to manipulate her into behaving like a housewife and refusing to buy food for my kids. Some people are taking her side and saying that I'm a dick for not helping her out. \n\n100% balls out honesty. I don't think I'm in the wrong. But maybe I'm missing something.", "created_utc": 1699025599, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17mxqds/aita_because_i_wont_buy_food_for_my_ex_and_our/", "score": 8124, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's good that you followed up with the kids to make sure they're being taken care of while they're there.\n\nAs for the people badmouthing you, you don't owe your ex-wife anything.  You are divorced.  She is literally not your problem.  Anyone who reaches out to you about it, I'd tell them *\"I offered to give her free groceries so that she and my children would have food, and she said no because she already has groceries and wants to order Uber Eats instead, and wants me to pay for it.

Some people are taking her side and saying that I'm a dick for not helping her out.\n\nSuch bullshit. She's too damn lazy to cook is all. (And maybe there's a dose of taking out her husband leaving her on you)", "Definitely NTA- there's no reason to be giving her money. She asked for help with food you were readily willing to give her some of your food! But she doesn't want/need help with food. She wants/needs money. With 50/50 custody you shouldn't have to give her any money. If she absolutely needs it she will have to apply for government benefits. She's being ridiculous", "NTA.   You used the same approach I use with panhandlers. I will buy food for them and give them the food, but I will not give them money. And it's quite disappointing how few people will let me buy them a sandwich or a meal when they want money", "NTA, if she's broke she has no business ordering Uber eats and SHOULD be grateful for your 'scraps'.\n\nI suggest you start recording your interactions with your ex, might come in handy eventually.", "NTA. she doesn\u2019t wanna cook,  that\u2019s fine and i get it. but to be so lazy you would rather spend an extra $30 for the delivery, the tip, the random extra expenses that food delivery apps tack on, instead of just going to the place yourself to pick up the meals is idiotic when you\u2019re expecting it on someone else\u2019s dime. at that point, call papa johns and order a couple pizzas and it\u2019s way cheaper. \n\n(i wanna mention, just in case anyone has a problem with me saying she\u2019s too lazy to at least grab the food herself: i have a painful disability and can\u2019t drive, and uber eats/ grub hub etc has been a life saver for me at times. but it\u2019s my money, i\u2019m not asking my exes for a delivery)", "NTA\n\nIf anyone confronts you, tell them your ex wants money for take out!!\n\nShe doesn't want food, which you offered, and which your sons are happy to take.\n\nTalk to your boys and see if it's time for a change in the custody agreement.\n\nGood Luck", "Am I the only one who has the sneaking suspicion the ex isn\u2019t just planning on using that money for food? Because it seems like your kids aren\u2019t as distressed as your ex makes them out to be, and that there is actually some food in the house.", "This is a wild response from your ex \u2014 you are NTA here. \n\nIf people are taking her side, don\u2019t take it too hard. They heard the drama from her and I\u2019m sure she didn\u2019t present the situation in a fair light. If you\u2019re close with them ideally you\u2019ll have a chance to set the record straight, and if they refuse to see the insanity of refusing high-quality, excellent food because you will have to prepare it, then you can safely distance those people from your life.\n\nBeing able to make food is required of parents.", "NTA, you're good. Wife sounds awful with money and maybe a little manic. Kids sound like they're dealing with it decently. No one is forcing her to do domestic duties except her economic situation.

But you did nothing wrong here. You immediately made arrangements to provide food, it just wasn't takeout like her entitled ass wanted. Just keep making sure your kids are fed and ignore her pathetic tantrums.", "NTA. \nYou did exactly what she asked, it's not your fault she wanted something different. Kudos for asking the kids directly if they were fine.", "NTA\n\nSounds like a social media issue, right? I mean you're not in group text or getting calls or seeing these people face to face, right? If so, block that account and ignore. It's just not worth even thinking about. \n\nYour kids know the truth. You know the truth. If anyone confronts you you can give your side, but ignore otherwise. If she asks again maybe offer to change your custody agreement and have the kids more than 50% so that you can provide healthy food.", "Your ex is either too lazy to prepare food from ingredients or wants the money for something else.\n\nI'm not a cook, but it isn't hard to find simple recipes or even tutorial videos online.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Talk about choosy beggars. You aren't manipulating her into \"behaving like a housewife\", you are just expecting her to do some of the most basic adult activities that she needs to keep herself alive. You then made sure that your kids do have the food that they need. Its sad that the preteen and teenager have more life skills than your ex.", "NTA, I\u2019m confused on why she thinks preparing food for her kids is being manipulated into being a housewife\u2026 it\u2019s called being a normal parent. Clearly, she\u2019s nobody\u2019s housewife anyways.", "NTA - if ex isn\u2019t prepared to feed the children ask her to send them round for a meal. That way you get more time with them, she doesnt have to be a housewife and the children are given decent meals.", "The cost of one Uber eats delivery is the cost of a full week of groceries at the store.  She\u2019s being unreasonable and you\u2019re being very nice!", "NTA.  She didn\u2019t want food.", "NTA. Turns out she didn't need money for food afterall. I think you caught her in a lie and now she's mad at you for it.", "NTA - if I'd had this conversation with my ex, it would have ended with \"I'll be over to pick the kids uo since you aren't interested in feeding your own children.\"", "NTA. You made sure your kids can eat. That's what essential.\n\nThough, if you WANT to give away good game meat, I'll definitely take some!", "NTA\n\nYou reached out to your kids to make sure they don't go hungry, and you provided food for her in her time of need.\n\nYour ex is obviously just being lazy.", "NTA lmao anybody who tried to contact you tell them your children already said there is food and offered two weeks worth of unopened groceries. Tell them to give her money laugh and hang up or block. She really tried it.", "Sounds like you were giving her the same \u2018scraps\u2019 you eat yourselves lol.\n\nNTA. You don\u2019t owe her money. You checked in with the kids and they know they have you if they need anything.", "NTA, things like Uber eats are a luxury, you\u2019re more than happy to provide your children with the essentials", "NTA - There food there and she can not be bothered to cook.", "NTA.   She asked for food and you offered 2 weeks worth of food.  If she's too lazy to cook that's her problem", "NTA. If she\u2019s low on funds, why on earth is she not stretching her dollars further? No one\u2019s entitled to food delivery.", "NTA - No wonder she's had 2 failed marriages.", "NTA- she asked you for money for food, you were going to provide said food. Then she said she didn\u2019t want it. You tried to give her what she asked for.", "NTA- first off game meat is delicious & healthy ! Also seems that she is too lazy to cook & maybe got used to just ordering her food for the kiddos. Don\u2019t let her manipulate you into giving her money", "NTA. I wonder if she wants the money for something else.", "NTA. All her.  Apparently she has never learned the term \u201cBeggars can\u2019t be choosers.\u201d Now she has.", "And now you know why hubby 2 left. Ntah", "Nta. Her ass is too broke to eat out but wants to anyway.", "NTA. You did nothing wrong. Your ex wants money from you. Simple as that.", "NTA. Does your ex wife work? If she doesn't she can start working, the kids are old enough to be home alone. She's not starving, she wants Uber food.  For the people that are complaining, they can door dash her some food.", ">I am trying to manipulate her into behaving like a housewife\n\nNTA Cooking is a life skill and everyone needs to learn how to do it.

How hard is it to throw a roast in a rotisserie or hell even a crock pot. EASY! You are trying to do right by your kids and it\u2019s laughable to continues to make comments about being \u201cdomesticated\u201d.", "Nta. Talk to your kids and maybe have them stay with you more if her house doesn\u2019t have food for them and she\u2019s refusing to cook.

A few times in my life I\u2019ve had an acquaintance ask for money but refuse food, and it was always for drugs.  NTA.  But whatever is really going on, there\u2019s an excellent chance that if she refuses to cook she also refuses to clean.  Make sure your kids aren\u2019t in filth over there.", "Dude , you are definitely not an asshole ! She seems manipulative and entitled so I can see why guys would just abandon their houses and run for their lives ..lol.", "NTA. If she and her children were actually going hungry and you were more than willing to give her several weeks worth of food, she should be grateful. It\u2019s not expecting her to \u201cact like a housewife\u201d to expect her to cook food for her own children? I\u2019m not a \u201chousewife\u201d but I still cook dinner? You\u2019re obviously not a housewife but it sounds like you know how to cook and so does your son. Shes just lazy and trying to take advantage of your willingness to help your children", "Nta. I would suggest, if your kids come to you frequently complaining of being hungry, I would go back to the courts to rearrange custody as if she isn't feeding them sufficiently then she isn't a fit parent, especially if she is rejecting valid resources for laziness.", "NTA\n\nShe can cook, she is being lazy.  You offered food that is absolutely healthier than what she wants.  You did good.", "You are definitely NTA.  She doesn\u2019t actually need food, she\u2019s looking for cash.  Have you considered getting full custody of your children?", "People with money problems eating or ordering out make me so aggravated. Part of the way we deal with our money problem is watching the grocery store sales, buying the sales and cooking at home.", "NTA.  This is becoming such a common theme--people who ask for your assistance but really just want your money (and, honestly, to waste your money at that).\n\nAnd sorry, but as a woman and a feminist, I'm super offended that she is trying to turn this into some sort of gender roles issue.  If she doesn't want to be treated like a housewife, then the best thing she can do is go out and get a job that provides for herself and her kids rather than depending on men to put food on her table. Nobody, and I mean absolutely nobody, is going to see her eating Uber Eats and think, \"now there's an independent woman if I ever saw one.\"", "NTA. \n\nI definitely relate to the feeling of \u201cI\u2019m barely surviving and cannot handle cooking right now\u201d. But if that were the case then she could have said so instead of disparaging you to everyone. Or she could have asked those friends for a short term meal train.", "NTA. I would have been extremely grateful for 2 weeks of completely free food. I also like the idea of game meat more than store bought so I\u2019d be *extra* grateful for free game meat.", "NTA- Sounds like our exes are very similar. I gave mine a quarter million at separation. She put the minimum down on a house and spent the rest on takeout. Now instead of being comfortable and providing my sons with some kind of inheritance, she lives in assisted living and is in huge debt. Some people you just can\u2019t help.", "NTA. You offered her TWO WEEKS of food. That's several hundred dollars worth in this economy. She wasn't going to spend that money on food, which is more concerning.\n\nDoes she not cook for at least the youngest kid? Ever?", "Damn, if you were offering me that kind of bounty, I'd be falling all over myself! Do you know how many good meals you could make with that kind of stuff? Well, yeah, you probably do. I'm literally salivating over the thought of good game stews from that list. (I'm really good at making a nice hearty stew, and it barely feels like work)\n\nMaking meals out of ingredients is adulting. It's not \"manipulating someone into behaving like a housewife.\" It's **providing.** \n\nBegging for food then insisting it be Uber Eats is the epitome of choosy beggar entitlement.\n\nGood on you for making sure the kids aren't truly starving.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. \n\n>Both kids texted back and said there was food in the house it just needed to be prepared. Both of them also said that if I was willing to spare some of the elk and hog roasts they would take them. I laughed and said I would take them over later.\n\nOk, WTF is wrong with your ex? They have food. Sure, it's not always fun cooking but why isn't she asking her older son, who you said likes and knows how, to cook dinner? It seems like an age-appropriate household task.", "NTA, if you are not legally obligated to give her Child support and your kids say they are fine then you owe her nothing. You were very kind to give her food, you did not need to.", "NTA. Your good dude. Your kids seem to have a handle on things also.", "NTA wanting money instead of the product the money is for is a red flag, she either has something going on or got used to ordering in with the bigger budget she had with her ex and doesn\u2019t want to adapt to her new reality. both ways she needs to make due with what she has and not expect others to fulfill her desired lifestyle.", "NTA.  She wants to feed her children and you offered her food.  The fact that she thinks that this is somehow manipulative is ridiculous. Everyone who thinks you are a dick should send her $$.  you did nothing wrong.", "If there's food in the house and the mom can't cook it, she better be handicapped somehow.  She's just lazy.\n\nYou're good my dude. And your kids seem to ve managing.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nOkay, so, she obviously doesn\u2019t need the money for food\u2026 what *does* she need the money actually for should be the concern. \n\nHopefully it\u2019s just because she\u2019s unwilling to cook and not something more. \n\nEither way, keep a record of all these interactions, you might need them in the future.", "NTA.\n\nYour title is misleading.\n\nYou offered her food, she did not accept and really just wants money.\n\nIf your kids don\u2019t have anything to eat, you may need to talk to the judge about custody. The boys are old enough to have a day as well.", "NTA she wants your money, not your food. \n\nThere is food in the house, the kids can cook too, she\u2019s just lazy and wants your money.", "NTA. Uber Eats and all those delivery services get expensive. No wonder she can't afford them. Haha the majority of us have to buy and make groceries most of the time. If she really needed food she would take what you offered and be grateful.", "NTA\n\nAnd she\u2019s out of money because she keeps buying expensive takeout.", "NTA", "NTA \n\nIf she wants the money and not the food, then she isn't going to buy food. And even if she were to buy takeout, why not take food that would last longer than something like McDonalds that doesn't even fully fill you up???", "NTA. Your ex is trying to manipulate you and the story because she\u2019s too lazy to actually cook a meal. You should not be giving her money at all. You did the right thing by offering her actual food.", "NTA, it's one thing to help her with food which you offered, it's a completely different thing to pay for a takeout. If she is that straped for cash she shouldn't be having takeout, the amount it costs for that would cover a few days worth of food, it makes no sense, other than she is too lazy to cook even though she can't afford not to. You're not trying to turn her into a housewife. you're just helping to feed your kids with healthy food. If she doesn't want to cook & feed her kids well, then that is on her to find a solution & not expect you to pay for takeout.", "NTA. The fact that the kids CAN and DO cook tells me that it was never about food, that she wanted the money for something else. Drugs? Gambling?", "NTA. Sounds like she wants money for something other than food for kids. \n\nKids probably do their own meals from the sounds of it.\n\nMaybe she needs new extensions, nails done, more wine.   Dating site subscription. Who knows.\n\nSounds like ex supported her and left.", "NTA\nYour ex seems pretty entitled, but your kids are doing fine. I agree with them. I'd jump at the chance to get some elk and wild hog meat (venison too). That's good eating. Hopefully they know how to cook those items since your ex probably will be too lazy to.", "NTA\n\n>She wanted me to give her money for Uber eats or something.\n\nShe wants the money for something else, something tells me is for personal use", "NTA- if providing a hot meal for her children is being \u201cmanipulated into being a housewife\u201d then I can see why you split up.", "She\u2019s wild NTA", "NTA looks like you're dealing with a choosing beggar.\n\ni know you said you don't know particulars but i'm guessing this is her whole MO. And it looks like her children are more competent than she is. really kind of sad when the kids are the ones saying 'we have food at home'", "NTA, I\u2019m starting to see why she\u2019s twice divorced \ud83d\udc40", "Is she unwell? I\u2019m not being sarcastic or mean - like is something off with her mental health? I can\u2019t fathom asking an ex for money for Uber eats. My husband and I make very decent money and I feel guilty ordering delivery a few times a month.", "It seems pretty obvious that she wants the money for something else in my opinion.\n\nThis, to me, is the same as when a homeless person approaches you outside a McDonald's or something, you offer to buy them lunch, but they insist that you should just give them $20. Hmmmmmmm.\n\nNTA.", "NTA - She wants money for drugs.", "Totally not the asshole.", "NTA. When you have children, you're signing up to take care of them. Part of taking care of them is feeding them.

You're feeding your kids. Ex can hunt her own food.", "Definitely NTA.  It\u2019s money she wants. You should buy groceries for your kids and deduct the amount from the child support I\u2019m assuming you are paying?", "Nta. Seems pretty clear why she's making so many exes", "NTA - you have an obligation to make sure your kids are fed HOWEVER it doesn't have to be takeout.

I don't understad those people who rather eat junk food when the, could get very delicious and healthy food for FREE.", "NTA.   She is either lazy (Uber eats) or needs MONEY for something else that she won't admit you.", "NTA - I didn't realise only housewives cooked \ud83e\udd26", "Not wrong at all. Good thing she\u2019s your ex because wow that entitlement and behavior is just insane. NTA.", "NTA. Your ex is truly weird though. Her issues with budget and cooking is her personal headache. How she solves it is also her business. She tries to manipulate you into solving her problems. Don\u2019t let her do that.\nJuat make sure kids are fine.", "Absolutely not wrong!  She wanted cash so she can be lazy.  You are an awesome dad to check on your kids and they are just as awesome to be honest with you!", "NTA. She asked for help with food. You offered food. If she's only wanting Uber Eats, it's no wonder she blew through her food budget so quickly.\n\nIf I were you, I'd keep records of what she told you. The court might be interested to hear that she's unwilling to cook for her children.", "Nta she is call child services and report her.", "NTA at all.\n\nIt's clear that she wanted money.  That's all.  If it was about food, she'd have taken it.  100%", "NTA. Her refusal to actually prepare a meal doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re forcing her into indentured servitude it means she has to actually cook a meal for the kids, who seem more than willing to help on that front. Good thing your kids know how to cook but I feel sad for them if all they\u2019re eating is takeout when they\u2019re with her.", "NTA.  You offered food that your kids would eat. It might be different if you offered food that you knew your kids *wouldn't* eat. But that's not what happened.", "NTA, your ex is trying to use your kids to get you to resume alimony since her new squeeze didn't work out.\n\nNot your problem.", "NTA, also good on you for following up with the kids.", "NTA\n\nIf your budget is tight, you don't get takeout anyway.\nAnd you have raised self sufficient kids that are able and willing to help with food prep.\n\nI am suspicious she wanted the money BECAUSE she wanted takeout, or worse, because she wants something else.\n\nI hope this is a reflection of temporary crap she's going through while she processes her divorce.", "Nta. You offered your stock food. You didn't have to. Then you reached out to the kids to see if they're OK, and you're going to give them something that they're craving!!! You did food. Your kids know they can come to you if they need anything, and that's all that matters. Not the opinions of others.", "NTA  Cooking for your own children isn't trying to turn her into homemaker. Can probably guess why husband left.", "NTA. Whatever mistakes were made with you that ended the marriage, she clearly didn't learn from them the second time around. You are only getting the brunt of it because you are still there to be yelled at. You've got your mind right about your kids. She is not your concern. She's trying to make herself your concern.", "NTA she sounds like a lazy parent", "NTA.  And I doubt very much that money was going to be spent on food.", "NTA.

And explain exactly what your ex asked for.", "Nta she literally has food but can't be bothered to cook it.", "Time to go for increased custody of those babes and have her pay support.", "NTA and I agree, time to revisit custody arrangements", "NTA at all. Firstly, she is no longer your problem. If she needs money, she can get a job or go to a food bank. If the kids need food, they can come home, or you can take them the groceries. You aren't depriving anyone of anything other than your ex who just wants junk food. Which is probably why she's out of food money.", "Nta but it sounds like her issue isn't a need for food but instead a need for time and labor. I'd make sure the kids are comfy cooking at her house, and if not see if the kids can come over and premake some casseroles and other \"all you have to do is heat it\" foods to bring to her house. You could also do this yourself. You're not obligated to, but as someone who grew up with parents that couldn't cook, I can tell you that it really is limiting and the kids shouldn't have to cook for themselves all the time. Because they're children. [Also she might get nasty if they get the kitchen dirty, which would of course make them wary of cooking in her house.]\n\nIf the kids are fine, it's fine.", "The amount of people who say they are broke and eat takeout or at restaurants like it's their job is astounding.

Job done mate. \n\nShe was lying through her teeth, tried to emotionally blackmail you and failed dismally. Kudos to the kid taking advantage lol.\n\nNta. But I'd look further into this.", "Definitely NTA. You did the right thing- she said your kids needed food so you tried to provide it for them when she couldn\u2019t.

The kids are 12 and 15 now. We have been divorced for seven years now. We have 50/50 custody and she remarried so spousal support is done. \n\nHer new husband recently left her. I don't know, and am not interested, in the particulars. In my opinion he didn't seem like a terrible guy and he left her their house, once again I have no idea of debt load or anything like that. \n\nShe called me last week to see if I could please help her out with some food. She said that she had run through her budget for food for her and the kids and basically begged me to help her out. I asked her to give me a few minutes and I would call her back. \n\nI talked to my girlfriend, who lives with me, and we agreed that we could spare some food. We have a freezer full of elk, venison, and wild hog, as well as a well stocked pantry. We also have  beef, pork, and chicken. \n\nI called my ex back and told her to come by and pick up a big load of groceries. This is where it got weird. She said she didn't want groceries. She wanted me to give her money for Uber eats or something. \n\nI said no. I have two weeks worth of food that you can have. But I'm not giving you money for takeout. \n\nShe called me an asshole for expecting her to be grateful for my scraps. That I was expecting her to be all domestic. Everything I was going to give her was either frozen meat, canned veggies, fresh vegetables from the garden, and pasta/rice in unopened bags. I want my kids to eat well. Both of my kids hunt and my son, the older one, is a pretty good cook. He regularly makes meals for all of us at my house. Both kids eat game meat as well as store bought. \n\nI honestly thought I was doing what she asked. I told my girlfriend not to bother packing anything up. I texted both kids and told them to let me know if they were actually going hungry and I would take care of everything. \n\nBoth kids texted back and said there was food in the house it just needed to be prepared. Both of them also said that if I was willing to spare some of the elk and hog roasts they would take them. I laughed and said I would take them over later. \n\nMy ex however is telling everyone that I am trying to manipulate her into behaving like a housewife and refusing to buy food for my kids. Some people are taking her side and saying that I'm a dick for not helping her out. \n\n100% balls out honesty. I don't think I'm in the wrong. But maybe I'm missing something.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "NTA- you are just fine. Is this something where you need to investigate if you should have primary custody? You certainly seem on top of this. There is a reason she is an ex....", "If people are taking her side it\u2019s probably because she spun the truth. She wanted you to by her take out lol in no way were your kids without food", "NTA", "NTA. Oh my word! If she were TRULY going to go hungry, she would have taken you up on that immediately. Beggars can\u2019t be choosers. And what you were offering was more than generous! And she has to have spun this story in her favor to her supporters. Ridiculous!", "NTA. She doesn\u2019t need Uber eats she needs to learn how to cook. You were offering her wonderful food options, all she had to do was prepare them. Hell, your kids cook so she could ask them to help her prepare it if she\u2019s never cooked wild game before. It\u2019s not \u201cdomesticated\u201d to know how to prepare meals and honestly she just sounds like a lazy parent who never learned how to properly take care of her kids. Everyone should know how to cook.", "NTA", "She wants money for food but refuses food? Nah, NTA.", "Nta", "NOPE.\n\nNTA\n\nShe likely wasted her budget on Uber Eats if that is what she is asking for. Beggars don't get to be choosers. They aren't scraps either. And she has food, she's just lazy and likely wants money for something else. You did right to call the kids and let them know you won't let them go hungry, and shame on her for doing this to her kids.", "NTA She needs the money for something else. Talk to your kids when they are with you what is going there. Especially the older one should have noticed something.\n\nBut I wouldn't give her any money. There isn't any reason for it. If she needs money she should ask her last ex-husband.", "NTA.  She said they needed food, you were willing to provide food.  You aren't morally or ethically required to buy her Uber eats.  She's being entitled and ridiculous.", "NTA", "NTA. The audacity and entitlement is probably why she got left twice.", "This is just like the addict at the fast food restaurant asking for \"food\". When you offer to take them in to buy whatever they want, they say no just give me money.", "NTA.  Ur doing the right thing.  Your kids are old enough to help you manage helping them, too.", "7 f..king years and she thinks you still should cater to her wishes?  You should tell her to go pound sand, and that your kids excellent cooks.  So what you offered is food they know how to cook and they won\u2019t starve to death like she implied.", "You're not helping her because she does not want the food. So why does she want the money?,NTA", "NTA. Being willing to split a freezer full of elk and other game is peak generosity. She's not starving, she's just spoiled. Honestly I'd keep in touch with the kids and make sure they're getting enough food if ex isn't cooking anything for them cuz you might want to consider rearrange custody so kids aren't foraging for snacks cuz ex doesn't want to cook. \n\nYou could send over Uber eats but then make sure it's always food she hates that the kids love just to be petty, but idk probably better to be mature lol", "NTA - It is very generous you were willing to give her groceries. Very kind. Her want for already prepared food is greedy and selfish. Prepared foods cost a lot more than foods you prepare (by and large). If you are concerned about the \"everyone\" part of it, you can ask your kids to talk up the meat you gave them (hey kids, let your mom's folks know I brought you some meat for you to cook up). Or more fun post a hunt pic to socials and talk about how you are so happy you can provide for your family from the wealth of the land and this tradition, family blah blah I GAVE MY KIDS MEAT!\n\nShe's being ungrateful and a big whiner. Sorry.", "NTA, I don't even see why you need to ask.", "NTA, I don't like to cook. I really don't like the clean-up aspect of cooking. We do take-out a lot, a lot more than we should probably. But I also know that when money is tighter or i need to save more, I go into the freezer and pantry and pull things out to cook dinner in the kitchen.", "NTA- it would be different if you were denying your kids food when you have a full freezer just to be petty. That\u2019s not the case. The kids don\u2019t seem to feel like they\u2019re food insecure. \n\nPreparing food is not a \u201chousewife duty\u201d, it\u2019s a basic human life skill. A 6 year old can be taught how to make a ham sandwich or a bowl of cereal. A grown ass woman does not need to be ordering Uber Eats if she can\u2019t afford it. \n\nSo no, NTA. But on a more important note\u2026can I come by and get some elk and wild hog?", "NTA - Tell her that you can keep the kids full time until she \u201cgets back on her feet\u201d. Seriously, she sounds like she\u2019s off her rocker so I think having the kids with you full time for a little while might actually be a good idea.", "Nta. Who turns down ELK?!", "You arent missing anything. Takeout is expensive and when the going gets tough (being tired, having to cook for the kids you made) she needs to be able to use what she has. Asking for money for prepared food is not the answer. Especially when one of the kids can cook. NTA.", "NTA", "NTA. Can't figure out what your ex wants, but it's not actually feeding people. Maybe money is tight and was hoping for that, using food for kids as the reason. Myself here in the country among farmers and and hunters, none of us are starving and all our freezers are packed being beginning of November. I'll buy rice and coffee because it doesn't grow where I live, but we're covered for months.", "NTA", "Nta. You offered food and she just wanted take out", "NTA.

More like making her be a damn mom. \n\nScrew that. NTA", "Nta at all. Hell if I could I'd jump at the chance to be given some hunter gather foods. I mean garden fresh veggies, elk, venison, hog... That's stuff that my super poor and unable to hunt or garden butt would love to cook and eat and feed my kids with. Wild game is far more ethical than store bought farm animals plus often times leaner anyways. Then add in the pricing and system of Uber eats or door dash it's even more ethical than store bought food.

No wonder the new hubby left her.", "Definitely NTA. Your ex is a massive AH.", "NTA. Your children aren't starving. They have food, and you offered more food. If your wife can't manage to feed your children, maybe it's time to revisit your custody agreement.", "NTA, Your ex is a big time manipulator.

Its for herself and her own kids. How in the world is that trying to turn her into a housewife? In a house you're not even in?

I'm sure your kids know it too.", "NTA, but be prepared for the drama.", "Send her a listing for local food pantries, the online application for food stamps and offer to keep the kids more of that makes it easier for her.

She asked for *food* and you offered *food* when she actually wanted *money*.\n\nPs she'd die where I live Uber eats isn't even kind of an option. \n\nEven the closest pizza places (8 miles) don't deliver.

NTA, You have a wonderful relationship with your kids", "NTA and I'd be willing to put a side bet she had some other ideas for that money other than \"Uber eats\".

I do not like handling raw meat at all. \n \nBut to equate cooking with being a housewife is just ridiculous. My husband does most of the cooking in my house, does that mean he's a housewife?

The one who hunts. She could even ask him to cook it for her.", "Thanks!", "> Would it be cheaper to hunt on land that isn\u2019t yours...Or do you need to own land to hunt?\n\nIn terms of money, yes it is cheaper to hunt land that is not yours.  In terms of time, no, it is not cheaper.  Public land hunters spend a ton of time scouting, sitting in blinds, and hoping that an animal will come out.  You can lease land, but then you are also dealing with other uses.  I used to hunt a lease that also had a cattle lease.  If the cattle move in on your blind, you are just stuck looking at cow ass.\n\n> I\u2019m assuming you can buy permits to kill up to a certain amount of whatever animal per season?\n\nIt really depends on your location.  In some states, you are given a certain number of permits per acre of land.  In others, you can buy a certain number of tags per season.  There isn't a clear cut answer to this question because of the differences from state to state.\n\n> And do you need to do all of those repairs? As in legally required or the animals will disappear? \n\nThe repairs to fences are to prevent poaching and to maintain boundaries with neighbors and others.  Where my family land is, we have to have no trespassing and no hunting posted, otherwise people can walk in on you.  Our land is heavily wooded, and fences get knocked down by falling limbs, trees, etc.  With regard to other repairs, such as tractor maintenance, we do those regularly to take care of equipment just like you would change the oil in your car.  Waterway maintenance is required because we have beavers on our land, and the buggers like to dam up our creeks.  This creates access problems for our land if we don't do the maintenance.  Feed fields are the only thing we don't have to do to maintain the land.  We plant fields with good nutrition so that our local deer herd stays healthy and nearby.  Hay bailing is something that offsets some of the cost, because we can sell the bales, but we have to maintain the thresher and bailer. \n\nIf we didn't want to keep the land in good shape, we could let a lot of this go, but then we wouldn't be able to use the land.  \n\n> As in legally required or the animals will disappear? \n\nWe are only legally required to destroy feral hogs when we see them, and to get rid of fescue as part of a reseeding program that is intended to bring back native grasses.", "We do sell the baled hay.  We don't have horse grade costal right now.  We are currently working on restoring our place to native grasses.  In the 50s, a bunch of fescue was planted in our hay fields for cattle feed.  We have been working to get rid of it because it is not great for anything but cattle.", "I feel like that is a pretty good deal!", "That's really nice of him!", "exactly. And you are not only maintaining the land, but you need to purchase the proper licenses, you need to maintain your guns and/or bows, you are likely paying someone to process it... it is certainly not \"free\"", "Yeah, but it takes a fair amount of ammo to become a good shot.", ">if youre a good shot its 1 round 1 animal for hunting.\n\nI mean if you're a bad shot you really shouldn't be hunting lol. Accidents happen but it should feasibly only take one round.", "You don't become a good shot without a lot of time on the range though", "Shooting skill diminishes. You need to keep going to the range to maintain accuracy. \n\nEven if you don\u2019t diminish. You should still go to the range after hunting to zero in your scope.", "But you can't be a good shot unless you've done many more rounds than that at the range.  Okay, you can do a lot of practice on .22s at six cents a round, but eventually you're going to need to be practicing with your actual rifle with the actual round you are using at a dollar a shot.", "This comment just made me snort Diet Coke through my nose!
