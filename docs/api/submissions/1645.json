From either side.", "Ok, not sure why the hostility, but alright:\n\nIn the right tone and context, this would be a funny joke because of the situation, relationship, and the irony. The person the joke was at the expense of was in a relationship (I'm assuming with a sexual component) with the boss's son, and the joke is that even though the hubby worked hard to get where he is, people take jabs at him because of his relationship with the boss's son. \n\nThe joke would not have been funny had it been true, because there would've been no ironic statement there. The part of this that makes it funny is that everyone knows that it isn't true. The other situation that would've made this not funny is if the tone of the person saying it was accusatory, snarky, nasty or sarcastic, which is exactly why I asked OP about the tone. \n\nOnce again, I'm gonna ask, what part of my comment made you dislike me and downvote me? If you don't see the possibility of humour in irony, it's not my fault for being able to. Or did you simply think it was unfunny because it was factually true and therefore an attack at him?"]}
