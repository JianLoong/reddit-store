Beyond that, I think 'old' status depends on factors besides just strictly the age in years of the person. \n\nI work in long-term healthcare, a heavy duty physically demanding job, and I used to work with a lady in her early seventies. She was still working full time when she turned 70, and ran circles around the staff in their 20s; she chose at 70 to drop to part time, because  she said she'd be bored if she didn't have something scheduled at least a couple days a week, given her husband was still working (she was 10 years older). She fully retired at 75, when her husband did. I also have an aunt who's 88, still 100% independent, sharp as ever, a little achy in the joints at times, but in really good health otherwise, tons of energy (started a business last year, mostly for fun) etc, and she's likely to keep going for quite a while. If she's 18 years past this idea of 'old' and likely to go a good while yet, is she 'old plus' or something along those lines?", "Not at all. I suppose she would still be old. I had a great aunt who was 101 when she died, had to use a walking stick and could not walk long distances, but mentally still sharp indeed.\n\nWhen she was in her 90s and her daughter in her 70s, they were both old. \n\nOld, of course, doesn't necessarily mean infirm, and there are large differences between people of the same age (which you are certainly very aware of, considering your job). Just because you know a 80 year old who still rocks at a corporally demanding job does not mean old age starts with 90 now, does it?\n\nNo matter. I was merely surprised by the drift of meaning, that's all."]}
