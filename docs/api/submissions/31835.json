Thats not your problem. \n\nAnd then the old lady had to go run her mouth to somebody that could kick her out-and so he did. Sucks for her. Sucks for her enabling daughter.

Good for you :)", "NTA \n\nLets get things straight, she got herself kicked out. \n\nAnd please do not feel bad, just because shes 70 doesn't mean its okay for her to harass you. You did the right thing and i'm surprised no one else in the pub/cafe said anything", "NTA. One is never too old to learn that their actions have consequences. It\u2019s not your fault she was thrown out; she did that all by herself. You handled that whole situation very well.", "NTA\n\nShe was harassing you for your disability. She earned her ignoble exit from the building. Don't feel guilty about it. You were the victim, not her", "NTA\n\nThe woman was the reason why she was thrown out. You did nothing wrong.", "Well well well, if it isn\u2019t the consequences of their own actions. NTA.", "NTA. It doesn't matter your age, if you're acting like a rude cow you get treated that way. She was harassing you, she got booted out. Her behaviour is what caused her to be thrown out.", "I mean i would feel bad too because i dont like to rock the boat. but you're not the ahole and your security friend is a good friend. that lady needs to learn that you never know what someone is going through and shouldnt just go around mouthing off to people. screw that old lady.", "NTA. The old lady had it coming. A lot of elderly people are lonely, in pain, bitter and or demented. Still it's no excuse to harass other people", "NTA\n\nShe got what she deserved. We need to stop this thing that when you grow beyond your 60s you're automatically an entitled toddler that gets away with stuff because \"they're old\". Yeah, you should be proud of yourself for getting a rude, ignorant, entitled old lady thrown out. You improved the whole place.", "NT; age is not an excuse to be an ass", "NTA, if anything you took one for the team since this woman was going to cause trouble for somebody that day.", "Nah, well deserved for them. They need to both grow the f up. That is rude, and awful. Sorry you had to experience that.", "Hah, awesome.  She's an old hag.  \n\n\nNTA, just a local hero.", "NTA. She did that herself. You were civil, she harassed you.", "She was the problem, not you. And she wasn't ever thrown out for harassing you, but for making a scene and idisrupting the environment when confronted by security.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Although I wouldn't call 70 old per se, you did nothing wrong in this situation.", "NTA. You answered truthfully and their own actions got them thrown out. Besides, being ableist and agist are not good looks, ever. And the older lady proved she was both by her harassment. I'm sorry you experienced this. I have a disability too and it often affects my mobility. I've gotten stares and glares from people when I use my walker or have to use a motorized cart in stores. Sometimes you just want a bullhorn and use it to shout at people for being horrible.", "NTA", "NTA but I really don't think this happened", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

(also have these issues when using disabled parking, to the point I have a sticker on my car that says \"I don't look disabled? You don't look stupid, but there you go\" got it on amazon \n\nLink :  https://www.amazon.co.uk/DISABLED-STUPID-Window-Bumper-Sticker/dp/B075CM2RN5/ref=sr_1_4?crid=JOY7L8JWXKAY&keywords=Car+sticker+i+dont+look+disabled&qid=1701087499&quartzVehicle=77-11239&replacementKeywords=car+sticker+dont+look+disabled&sprefix=car+sticker+i+dont+look+disabled%2Caps%2C118&sr=8-4\n\nThe problem is, for some reason, people have an increased sense of entitlement to your personal medical information if you are disabled, and they have no shame in demanding it.. I honestly don't understand it... but now, I do get a lot of fun out of being very disrespectful in my refusal of them, the pikachu face cracks me up, even when  they get Police involved for me being rude, the Officers are always like 'well, I would tell you to fuck off too, you don't have any right to that info' these idiots seem to forget that EVERYONE is one 10 min doctors appointment away from being told of a disability and their life being totally changed...", "You're NTA! I admire how calm you were in this situation, wish I could be more like that. It reminded of something that happened at the start of the year actually... \n\nMy son and I are both physically disabled. My disability isn't visible but my 6 year olds is unfortunately (same disability but he got much worse than I) He walks very slowly and is unbalanced. Last week we went to our local cinema and headed into the disabled toilet after the film. On our way out I noticed a mother and daughter waiting, as they passed the mother glared at me and after the door closed I heard her say passive aggressively \"I know darling, this is supposed to be a disabled toilet isn't it! Some people hey!\"\n\nI turned back around and rasied my voice slightly so she could hear me through the door and said, \"I expect better from someone like you. How dare you judge my son as not disabled enough to use this toilet, who on earth do you think you are?!\" she didn't respond.\n\nWhat got to me the most was her or her daughters disability wasn't visible. She should know what it feels like when you're accused of not being disabled more than anyone. I wouldn't dream of saying something like that because you never know! \n\nI should've just walked away. People like that aren't worth it, I just saw red.\n\nSorry to bang on and make this all about me.

She's old enough to understand her actions have consequences, and face them accordingly.", "NTA.  You shouldn't feel bad. She was nasty and disrespectful.  She got what she deserved and it's probably about time someone put her in her place.", "NTA absolutely, she was in the wrong. Some people have the notion that young people cannot have a disability and she's clearly one of them. She had no right to address you in that way .\n\nMy mother always told me that our elders should only receive the respect that they are willing to give in return.\n\nShe just sounds like a rather rude lady.", "It's policy to ask the security guard to go over instead of confronting them yourself, because I asked a guy to calm down last year and got punched in the face lol", "It's ok I'm used to it, you should see how people react to me asking for the priority seat on a crowded bus lol", "I'm bad with guessing ages by looking at people, she could have been older", "It did, i may not have put in all of what she said because I couldn't remember but it happened", "Why", "Sounds like a good policy then haha", "Regardless, there was no call for her to behave that way. My aunt is 88, and would both not make those kind of presumptions and not act that way toward someone."]}
