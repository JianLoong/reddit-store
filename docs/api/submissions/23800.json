Of course she is.\n\nAnd while i completely understand how you feel, a week is very short notice. Unless \"I gave her a week to think about it\" just means you wanted an answer/a plan from her for the future and she didn't even provide that much.", "NTA.  She is an adult and, as such, she needs to pull her own weight.  You aren't her mother and you let it go for quite a while before setting a deadline.  Sometimes it's tough to 'adult.'", "NTA\n\nYou let that go on for far too long.  Your mom doesn't want a mooch, either, hence her reaction.", "NTA.\n\nYour mooch-ectomy worked just fine. Sounds like your mom was just trying to keep her from coming back to her.", "Mom doesn't want the leach either.", "NTA - but a week is very short notice. Hopefully, she doesn\u2019t take you to court because depending on where you are 30 days notice is usually required.", "NTA", "NTA, and she probably was leeching off of you, you did the right thing, seriously people think that just because they\u2019re family means they can leech off of you", "Sounds like your sister is the definition of entitlement.  NTA.", "NTA It is hard enough to strike out on your own without a person taking advantage of your resources. You where clear and fair NTA", "NTA she is your sister and an adult not your child and not your problem.  You gave her a timeline. My guess is she didn't think you were serious.  She FAFO", "NTA, but I would have 1)given her longer than a week and 2)really sat her down and guided her as the older sister about being more responsible and changing her life around.", "Unfortunately I'd say ESH. Your sister's behavior is awful, but I don't think you handled it well. Firstly you accepted her decision or request to live with you and I don't blame you a bit for being unhappy with the reality of the dynamic, but IDK if you gave her sufficient notice to make a change. Obviously you should have worked out with her WHEN she moved in with you what the expectations of rent and division of expenses would be. It's not your job to parent your sister and it sounds like that's what she - and your mom - were expecting, so you were right to make a change but you are part of the reason it got to this in the first place.", "NTA, but communication is key. I would\u2019ve given her more time, job searching can be a long process.", "NTA but you only have her two options, maybe she wanted to get her own place but 1 week notice wasn\u2019t long enough?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
