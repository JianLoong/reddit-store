Of course she is.\n\nAnd while i completely understand how you feel, a week is very short notice. Unless \"I gave her a week to think about it\" just means you wanted an answer/a plan from her for the future and she didn't even provide that much.", "NTA.  She is an adult and, as such, she needs to pull her own weight.  You aren't her mother and you let it go for quite a while before setting a deadline.

Sounds like your mom was just trying to keep her from coming back to her.", "Mom doesn't want the leach either.", "NTA - but a week is very short notice. Hopefully, she doesn\u2019t take you to court because depending on where you are 30 days notice is usually required.", "NTA", "NTA, and she probably was leeching off of you, you did the right thing, seriously people think that just because they\u2019re family means they can leech off of you", "Sounds like your sister is the definition of entitlement.  NTA.", "NTA It is hard enough to strike out on your own without a person taking advantage of your resources. You where clear and fair NTA", "NTA she is your sister and an adult not your child and not your problem.  You gave her a timeline. My guess is she didn't think you were serious.  She FAFO", "NTA, but I would have 1)given her longer than a week and 2)really sat her down and guided her as the older sister about being more responsible and changing her life around.", "Unfortunately I'd say ESH. Your sister's behavior is awful, but I don't think you handled it well. Firstly you accepted her decision or request to live with you and I don't blame you a bit for being unhappy with the reality of the dynamic, but IDK if you gave her sufficient notice to make a change. Obviously you should have worked out with her WHEN she moved in with you what the expectations of rent and division of expenses would be. It's not your job to parent your sister and it sounds like that's what she - and your mom - were expecting, so you were right to make a change but you are part of the reason it got to this in the first place.", "NTA, but communication is key. I would\u2019ve given her more time, job searching can be a long process.", "NTA but you only have her two options, maybe she wanted to get her own place but 1 week notice wasn\u2019t long enough?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Living with you means that she should be on the lease and paying rent, if she doesn't like it she can freeload at mom's house.", "She is a leech and will continue to live off you if she can.\n\nYour mother knows that she will be leeching off her from now on.

The issue here is timing. The time to talk to your sister about these stipulations was ~when she moved in with you~. As far as your sister is concerned, everything was fine and you didn't express any unhappiness with the situation for three years, and suddenly she has to turn her whole life around in a week. Even if she had the best intentions of finding a job, a week is an impossible time frame for that. You are right to want to change the situation with your sister, but this was a terrible way to go about it.", "A week?  \n\nWhat happened the last 3 years?  \n\nLike, yeah of course she's leeching off you.  It's hard to get anything in a week though.  \n\nESH", "NTA. Your house, your rules. Sis is not your child. And greedy.", "NTA, but I don\u2019t think giving her just a week\u2019s notice was strategically a good move.

Still a dick move to only give one week.  \n\nIt's hard to get that stuff lined up in a month.  \n\nThe sister is definitely the bigger AH, but typically 30 days is standard for people to get their shit together and if you want what's best for them then you help point out the right ways to do it.", "Yes the 3 years was wrong, but there was no expectation then.  When you set a deadline it needs to be a reasonable one.  \n\nYou can't set one that's destined to fail then you pretend you gave them a chance.\n\nThe 3 years is why the sister is an AH.  \n\nThe 1 week limit is why the Op is an AH. \n\nThus, ESH.", "You made the right decision...", "NTA. She wants the freedom of being on her own without the responsibility that comes with it. I actually moved out with my younger sister when I was about 21 and her 19, and I made it very clear from the beginning that if she intended to live with me that everything would be split three ways (I had another roommate at the time) and if she couldn't handle that, then she wasn't living with me. She ended up not moving in with me because she couldn't afford it. Sorry boo - as much as I wish it wasn't true - freedom isn't free.", "It took you 3 years to figure out she IS a leech?  NTAH, you were more than generous to her for all that time.  Moms just mad cause she has to pay for her grown daughters way now.", "NTA. Your sister is an adult. If she didn't have a job you shouldn't have allowed her to move in with you.\n\nYour mother didn't want her back.", "I honestly don't get your comments, here so what it took her three years to realize she was being used? So what if she only gave her a week? Sister is 25 and needs to grow up.\n\nOP is NTA, her sister is.", "A week during which sister was out partying. I really doubt if giving her more time would have changed anything.", "Exactly, this is a full grown adult woman we are talking about here, a full weeks notice is more than enough for her to get things straight and if it\u2019s not she made that choice by not getting a job; presumably for this whole period too.", "OP is a man.", "If you live at a residence even if you pay zero rent and are not on a lease. You almost always have established residence and would need to be served the same notices as if you were on a month to month lease.", "Which is probably still going to mom's"]}
