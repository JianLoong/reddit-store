{"id": 31680, "submission_id": "183f7eu", "title": "AITA for not letting my 14 year old cousin come on the \"cousin walk\"?", "selftext": "When the bulk of my generation of cousins were 16-19 we started a yearly tradition of a \"cousin walk\" at Thanksgiving. For people familiar, a \"cousin walk\" happens with a group of teenage/adult cousins where there are certain conversations and activities that maybe aren't appropriate for older or younger relatives. At the time, there were only 3 that were under 16: a 14 year old, a 4 year old, and a baby.\n\n14 is kind of pushing it, but with the age differences, it seemed mean and stupid to leave the 14 year old out and it would draw more attention, so we brought her with us. This became a yearly tradition. The two youngest would ask to go, but we always said it was an older cousin/older kid thing and everyone accepted it. \n\nThis Thanksgiving, that 4 year old is now 14. We went to go on our walk as usual, and this time my aunts really didn't accept that he couldn't come because we let Sheila (fake name) come when she was 14 so he's clearly old enough now and should \"be included\". NO. He's too young, and it's not appropriate. \n\nSheila was too young, but it was \"vaguely pushing it\" young with the rest of us being very close in age. Now we're all in our 20s being asked to include a kid. Also, not for nothing, but all of us (including her) were in high school when this started. This was all teenagers, not 20 somethings and a middle schooler. \n\nShe kept pushing and wouldn't understand why we were being so \"mean\" and not including him, and of course we couldn't admit exactly why. We were eventually let go, but she's been all over the family group chat about how awful we are and how we are all lacking in family values if we are so exclusive. \n\nI don't think we're in the wrong. Having an adult cousin only activity isn't inappropriate. There's just too much of an age gap that unfortunately there are two cousin groups.", "created_utc": 1700900773, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/183f7eu/aita_for_not_letting_my_14_year_old_cousin_come/", "score": 330, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Than this wouldn\u2019t be the issue.", "The issue here isn't absolute age, it's age gap.  When this event started, the 14 year old was only 2 years younger than the rest of you, so including her wasn't out of line and you all shared similar interests and topics of conversation.\n\nTen years later, the current 14 year old is now ten years younger than the youngest person in the cousin group.  You have likely moved on to topics in which you don't think it would be appropriate to include a 14 year old.\n\nYour aunt sounds as if there might be a screw loose and a bit of a hostility problem, not to mention she wants what she waaaaaants.   None of these is a good reason to include the 14 year old.  Tell auntie you plan to have X-rated conversations and go enjoy your adults-only cousin walk.  Perhaps you can toast marshmallows with the 14 year old later.\n\nNTA", "NAH. You can't tell your aunt \"hey we're going to smoke a J before dinner, that's why we're not taking the 14-year-old\".
