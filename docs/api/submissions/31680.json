{"id": 31680, "submission_id": "183f7eu", "title": "AITA for not letting my 14 year old cousin come on the \"cousin walk\"?", "selftext": "When the bulk of my generation of cousins were 16-19 we started a yearly tradition of a \"cousin walk\" at Thanksgiving. For people familiar, a \"cousin walk\" happens with a group of teenage/adult cousins where there are certain conversations and activities that maybe aren't appropriate for older or younger relatives. At the time, there were only 3 that were under 16: a 14 year old, a 4 year old, and a baby.\n\n14 is kind of pushing it, but with the age differences, it seemed mean and stupid to leave the 14 year old out and it would draw more attention, so we brought her with us. This became a yearly tradition. The two youngest would ask to go, but we always said it was an older cousin/older kid thing and everyone accepted it. \n\nThis Thanksgiving, that 4 year old is now 14. We went to go on our walk as usual, and this time my aunts really didn't accept that he couldn't come because we let Sheila (fake name) come when she was 14 so he's clearly old enough now and should \"be included\". NO. He's too young, and it's not appropriate. \n\nSheila was too young, but it was \"vaguely pushing it\" young with the rest of us being very close in age. Now we're all in our 20s being asked to include a kid. Also, not for nothing, but all of us (including her) were in high school when this started. This was all teenagers, not 20 somethings and a middle schooler. \n\nShe kept pushing and wouldn't understand why we were being so \"mean\" and not including him, and of course we couldn't admit exactly why. We were eventually let go, but she's been all over the family group chat about how awful we are and how we are all lacking in family values if we are so exclusive. \n\nI don't think we're in the wrong. Having an adult cousin only activity isn't inappropriate. There's just too much of an age gap that unfortunately there are two cousin groups.", "created_utc": 1700900773, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/183f7eu/aita_for_not_letting_my_14_year_old_cousin_come/", "score": 5781, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I get why the aunty feels like her son is being excluded. They purely think it's a walk, and I agree that a 14 year old can sensibly participate in a walk with young adults.\n\nAlthough I understand that you will be doing something you don't want the family to know you're doing. \n\nI think you just have to suck it up and just accept that you're going to be the AH in their eyes.", "Just tell the aunt it's not just a 'walk'. We go and smoke pot and the chats tend to be more adult themed, this is why it isn't appropriate for a 14 year old  however if you are happy for your underage child to come along and partake in our adult activities then sound. If not this is why.\n\nEdited to add: as far as aunt and cousin are aware is that it's literally a wholesome family walk for cousins to catch up on their lives, so I can understand why your aunt and cousin feel like they're being left out. From their point of view they can understand smaller cousins not going along as they can get tired from long walks, need to be watched etc but a 14 year old doesn't so it literally looks like you're just singling this 14 year old out and make them feel unwanted, not part of the cousins/family. So just be honest and let aunt know what you guys are actually doing so they have some understanding of why the 14 year old isn't invited. Aunt can then make the decision on if they are happy for their child to come along but not partake in the smoking. I understand it's not something you want to really advertise to older family members but you are all old enough to make your own choices (and especially if you live in a place it's legal then so what if your aunt says something)", "You are NTA, but why can\u2019t you just tell your aunt what you\u2019re doing?  You\u2019re all over 18 \u2014 you don\u2019t need anyone\u2019s permission to smoke weed, dude.  A quick conversation would resolve this.", "Info: Did it occur to any of you to find something else to do with your cousin later on or do his feelings not matter at all to you?", "NTA\n\nIt's obvious the situation is different now that you're 20-somethings. It's not unreasonable for the aunts to ask for the now-14-year-old to be allowed to come but it's unreasonable to demand it. You should get to have your \"cousin walk\" with your cousin peers without being called an asshole.", "NTA but maybe rename the tradition. The gap between the original group and the younger cousins will never close. If will never feel right to include people so much younger than you.", "You need to own up to your family that you guys smoke weed. Than this wouldn\u2019t be the issue.", "The issue here isn't absolute age, it's age gap.  When this event started, the 14 year old was only 2 years younger than the rest of you, so including her wasn't out of line and you all shared similar interests and topics of conversation.\n\nTen years later, the current 14 year old is now ten years younger than the youngest person in the cousin group.  You have likely moved on to topics in which you don't think it would be appropriate to include a 14 year old.\n\nYour aunt sounds as if there might be a screw loose and a bit of a hostility problem, not to mention she wants what she waaaaaants.   None of these is a good reason to include the 14 year old.  Tell auntie you plan to have X-rated conversations and go enjoy your adults-only cousin walk.  Perhaps you can toast marshmallows with the 14 year old later.\n\nNTA", "NAH. You can't tell your aunt \"hey we're going to smoke a J before dinner, that's why we're not taking the 14-year-old\". So he just feels excluded for no good reason. Of course your aunt doesn't understand either. It was different when you were 17 sharing pot with your 14-year-old cousin, but as an older 20-something it would feel inappropriate to get a middle-schooler stoned.", "Nta it Is too much if an age gap. But it does suck for the kid that he feels excluded, is there another tradition you could start that could be more inclusive? Or is there another  cousin or two around his age that could start their own cousin /extended family walk?", "YTA. If you are all adults just admit that you are all going to smoke weed and you'll be left alone.", "It's so weird that you didn't just write in the post that you're smoking a joint on these walks. Anyway yta for how you handled it", "You and your cousins are immature as fuck. The \u201ccousin walk\u201d still being labelled the \u201ccousin walk\u201d whilst speaking to other relatives is, OF COURSE, going to make your younger cousin come with. There was an easy solution for all of this\u2026 literally not mentioning it infront of people not invited. Pretty much common sense. And now that your younger cousin does know about this \u201ccousin walk\u201d it doesn\u2019t take an Einstein to realise the best solution is to\u2026 take him on a walk that doesn\u2019t include weed and then doing your \u201cyearly tradition\u201d another day.\n\nThe fact you\u2019re jumping through hoops to try and make out your hard done by here is astonishing.", "YTA.

Then stop excluding your cousin on a holiday, he literally just wants to hang out with you.", "NTA\n\nI was the baby cousin, all my cousins are 10-15 years older than me so I was excluded from a lot of stuff like this. It hurt a little when I was a kid but now that I\u2019m old enough to understand (36) it doesn\u2019t phase me at all and I have a pretty good relationship with all of my cousins except one.", "Just tell them the truth you are going to smoke a joint or two", "A big consideration is whether the members joining already smoke weed or not. It's taking a huge risk to introduce someone to smoking weed for the first time a shortly before they sit down and get to converse at a big family meal. There's a very real chance it'll be noticed by at least someone. \n\nDepends on the family dynamics but I could image some parents being absolutely livid that you smoked out or even around their 14 year old daughter. Especially if you're older and should know better.", "The cousin walk is where we smoke weed we bring the 14 year old when we were under 18 but not when we got to be over", "OMGosh \ud83d\ude44y\u2019all are now in your 20s and there\u2019s not at least an open secret about the pot smoking? Maybe trade in the pull ups for panties and have a discussion with that aunt.", "Info: so were you guys smoking pot around 14 year old Sheila?", "I mean, \"cousin walk\" is a dumb thing to call it when you have children who can't participate who are also cousins. Just say you've got grown up shit to talk about and excuse yourselves for a bit to go smoke. Or just tell the adults you're going to get high and to make something up for the kids. It's 2023.", "If this is a weed walk then NTA. 14 year old is a little too young.\n\nYou're going to look like the AH though if your family thinks it's literally just a walk lol", "Aunts and uncles of 20 somethings were born in the 60s and 70s and have been smoking a lot longer than the cousins.  And they get the good shit.  THAT is why they want 14 year old out of the house for a bit.", "If the aunt can be at all reasonable, just pull her aside and tell her that the activity of the walk is smoking weed. That\u2019ll stop her from wanting you to include her kid, and she\u2019ll most likely put a stop to the 14 year old talking about it too.\n\nYou\u2019re now adults and your smoking a joint isn\u2019t anyone\u2019s business, just own it. It also doesn\u2019t really hurt now _a decade later_ to reveal to your parents that you were in fact occasionally smoking while in high school.", "YTA:\n\nYou keep saying it's not an adult only thing, yet not letting 14 go because he's too young although you let a 14 girl go before.\n\nEither let him join (which is too late thus AH) or make it an adult only thing.", "NTA. A 14 year old shouldn\u2019t be around weed.", "NTA. We have a cousin who is 12 (the rest of us are all in our 20s). She\u2019s REAAALLLY cringey, being a middle schooler, but she\u2019s family and we love her. We do stuff with her, but we also go out and do some stuff on our own, because we\u2019re all much older than her.", "I see where you\u2019re coming from but yeah it\u2019s not fair so YTA.\n\nIf the kid was immature if technically old enough that would be one thing but that\u2019s not the case and your point about the age gap will eventually mean the other younger cousins will be left out too causing a divide in your relationship.", "Yta.\n\nYou let another kid who was 14 join regardless of \"being close in age\". So by that standard you had already change the rules to be that this new turned 14 y/o cousin can join. You can't just change your own rules because of how you're feeling lmao\n\nJust tell them you all smoke pot and move on. Likelihood is they won't let the 14 y/o join", "Yeah that\u2019s a jerk thing to do. You e made it an annual tradition that means any cousin 14+ gets to go. You\u2019ve literally built it up to something the poor kid has been looking forward to for years and you excluded him. \n\nThat\u2019s a shit thing to do and he deserves better cousins. \nAnd yes I\u2019ve got heaps of younger cousins and siblings. They\u2019re not always fun, but they should always be included in family traditions. \n\nYTA go sneak off and do whatever dirtbag thing you really wanted to do later. Don\u2019t be an ass to your kid cousin.", "You could have found another way to go smoke your weed, first of all. And then you could have figured out some other activity on top of your silly little walk. And you could have included him in that. Go on with your selfish self.", "I guess time to accept the long awaited clear coming. You kinda really f-ed up the weed walk by giving in when 'Sheila' was 14 because if I read right ya'll were around 16-19 and somehow the older ones of ya'll bunch back then not taking in account that a decade later that 4 year old gonna be the same 14 and think they can come too.\nSo basically now that ya'll adults in your 20s, some probably just turned 30, just tell what's been up and what the walk actually was because I highly doubt you are still scared to get in trouble now that ya'll adults. You'll just have one annoying cousin who will hold this grudge up above your head lol. YTA for freaking it up.", "YTA. 14 was old enough before but now it ain't. Inappropriate conversations? Really? What teenager isn't having inappropriate conversations already? This could be a bonding and teaching moment instead of furthering the wedge between you the age gap has already provided.

Don't be surprised if your cousin won't have anything to do with you as she grows up.", "YTA for being vague and weird about what you're talking about in a post meant to determine if you were in the wrong about doing something.

She ended up going on a tirade about the being murdered in a \u201cdrug deal gone wrong\u201d and \u201chow could you even *think* that?!\u201d Her extreme reaction to cannabis is why even though I went through opiate addiction in my 20\u2019s, I still haven\u2019t ever told her anything, despite being sober for many years. \n\nShe\u2019s been forced to reevaluate her views since my state went fully legal so she\u2019s learning that it\u2019s not the \u201cgateway drug\u201d that DARE said it was and that it\u2019s not nearly as harmful as the thousands of prescription drugs pushed on people, but she still says \u201cwell it\u2019s illegal on a federal level and the government wouldn\u2019t make something illegal for no reason\u201d. I have to bite my tongue in those moments because, while her na\u00efvet\u00e9 is adorable, it\u2019s also impossible to educate her on something that she\u2019s already got driven into her head. I once tried explaining to her that all tea, genuine tea, has caffeine, and that \u201cherbal teas\u201d aren\u2019t really tea but rather an infusion. It wasn\u2019t a \u201cwell ACKSHULLY\u2026\u201d moment, it was more of a \u201cI learned X, and was surprised! Did you know this?\u201d kind of thing. It resulted in a weeklong silent treatment and avoiding me because she can\u2019t handle being told she was wrong about something, no matter how much proof or evidence you bring or how gently or kindly you do it. If that\u2019s how she reacted to me telling her that real tea has caffeine, you can imagine how she\u2019d react to me explaining the benefits (and showing her proof) of cannabis. \n\nIf OP\u2019s family hasn\u2019t caught on to the true nature of the walk, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the aunt is a bit like my mother and genuinely sees weed as a dangerous and addictive drug. Chances are she\u2019d completely ostracize the cousins or even try to smear them amongst the other family members as being \u201cdisgusting drug addicts\u201d. Even though she\u2019s probably on her own laundry list of pills as well as a wine mom who needs at least a bottle of Chardonnay by noon or she starts screaming at her kids.", "Or they know, and they know the 14 year old would spoil it lol", "Yeah I was so confused why people are saying the OP should openly tell their aunt they\u2019re going to smoke an illegal drug like they\u2019re going to pick up candy or something. If they have to hide it from the aunt, she\u2019s probably not cool enough to let know about this. Look how she reacted by texting the family. The walk shouldn\u2019t take that long. The 14 will live and they can do something with them when they get back. It\u2019s not that hard. My cousins did a lot of stuff with out me and I loved and never took it personally. The 14 needs to grow up and act his age and maybe they would take him next year, but now they\u2019re probably not going to wanna fuck with him at all.", "i went to a wedding recently and the bride\u2019s family was super conservative and the groom\u2019s family was super not that way lol. the kicker is they had a weed bar at the reception and it was wild. it\u2019s legal here and you had groom\u2019s family getting high casually and hanging out with bride\u2019s family that had to pretend to \u201cbe cool\u201d to not ruin the wedding. \n\nIt was hilarious to see and honestly I think it changed a lot of perspectives to see successful people getting along well enough while high as a kite.", "But then it looks like youre changing the tradition to exclude the cousin and youre back to square 1 where you either need to admit the whole point of the walk is to get intoxicated or be a dick to a 14 year old.", "But they might have quite a bit in common with a 14 year old.

Sports? You know, group activities.", "I hang out with my cousins aged 13-16 all the time as a mid-20s. They\u2019re easy to talk to about pop culture?

I mean, it's not like I *wouldn't* want to get high with my cousins if I wasn't allergic to pot, but it's never come up.  One of my cousins is basically straightedge - not a jerk about it but is pushing fifty and has never even had a sip of wine and at this point it's kind of like it's a point of pride to see how much weird stuff you can get into without ever using anything.  Another cousin just thinks it would be a bad look for a federal prosecutor - she doesn't have any problem with other people using; she prosecutes things like interstate child sex trafficking rings, so anything less that that doesn't even register with her.

Nonetheless, since it's federally illegal, it would be super awkward.\n\nI'm allergic to pot, and could technically lose my EMT license over it, although I can't imagine I would.  If you don't show up to work altered, and don't drive high or drunk even on your own time, nobody should care and nobody does.  Drive drunk even on your own time, and you're gone, though.

You have good reasons (in my opinion) for doing so, but he\u2019s also justified in her feelings about it.

Small wonder that he\u2019s having a meltdown and the older generation is annoyed at you. \n\nIt might be time to start brainstorming ways to make him feel special and included on holidays that don\u2019t require secret-keeping. And make sure that he knows that once he\u2019s an adult, he\u2019ll be welcome on these yearly walks - they\u2019re just one of those things that has evolved into an adults-only activity, and you promise he\u2019ll understand in a few years. In the meantime, if he needs to talk to any of you about stuff he\u2019s not ready to discuss with his parents, you\u2019re happy to listen and offer support.\n\nETA: mixed up the cousins, edited the pronouns", "This is also why your aunt feels so comfortable pushing you on this.
