We live in a different city from our families due to work. \n\nA few months ago my sister asked me if her daughter Kate (F19) can stay with us since she was starting college in our city. She was scared of her daughter moving away for first time, especially to a big city like ours. \n\nI knew Kate from before Covid time and remembered her to be a smart sweet kid. I discussed with my husband and we agreed she can stay with us. \n\nKate moved in around two months back. She was fine, came home on time, let us know her whereabouts, no partying. \n\nThe issue was with food. She had turned vegan. \n\nNormally I cook for my family. I cook just one meal for all. And we are all diary obsessed people. Milk for cereal, butter in pancakes, cheese in everything. Eggs were our staple. \n\nKate needed separate dishes altogether and we needed vegan substitutes for her. Since those are way more expensive, I told my sister she should give money to Kate so she can buy it. She stared telling me how family doesn't take money from family to feed kids. I told her I would feed Kate same as other kids but I won't spent excess money on her. She said thats fine. \n\nSince her mom won't buy it, Kate started buying plant based substitutes with her pocket money. For dishes like pancakes, I made food for her using her incrediants. \n\nBut everytime I made a huge non vegan meal, she expected me to provide equivalent vegan meals. I drew line at that. I can't spend so much time cooking another meal. She said everyone else got to eat it while she was left with few stuff go eat. I told her she is free to cook for herself and she hated that idea. \n\nIt came to a boiling point last weekend when we had a barbeque dinner with friends. She got upset that her salad was very basic, (it was good only with chicken added) and had nothing else to eat. She complained and I told her she can cook for herself. She got even more upset at that and called her mom crying about how I didn't make any good meals for her and expected her to fend for herself. \n\nMy sister called me yelling at me how I didn't love her daughter and was intentionally excluding her. My parents are also taking their side. \n\nAITA ?", "created_utc": 1694877416, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16ka136/aita_for_refusing_to_cook_separate_meal_for_my/", "score": 6700, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If she was vegan before, did her mother cook her meals? Did she pay for vegan substitutes for her own daughter? I\u2019m just trying to figure out why a 19 year old adult still feels entitled and expects people to cook lavish meals for her with their own time and money. NTA", "NTA\n\nIf they could send her to a dorm, they would have to pay for her food as well.  It was not good enough that you opened you home to her, but you had to cater also?  Not sure which aspect of your family is more entitled, Your niece, your sister, or your parents.  None of them want to spend a dime, but expect you to be the Maitre D at an all inclusive resort, that you don't get paid or tipped.  Maybe the best approach is telling them, the housing situation isn't working out.  There will be more howling until they realize there is no alternative that will cost them less. For some everything is never enough.", "INFO: Are you getting money for room & board?\n\nEdited to add judgement: NTA. You should not have to pay extra on top of what you\u2019re already providing.", "NTA. You aren't her maid or private chef. You are putting a roof over her head, and that is where your responsibilities end. If she wants to follow a specific diet, she can cook for herself or toodle off back to her mother.", "NTA\u2026what would she have done if she was living in the dorms or off campus?  Your sister should have told you upfront that her daughter is a vegan so that you could have made an informed decision,   \n\nYour niece is 19 and should be able to make meals for herself.  Your sister needs to stop expecting you to cater to her child.  If her daughter was staying in a dorm, they\u2019d have to pay for meals so not sure why she\u2019d say that family doesn\u2019t take money from family to feed kids.  This is a situation where your niece chose to be vegan and vegan options can get pricey.  \n\nYour sister and her daughter both seem quite entitled. Tell your sister that you will house her daughter  until the end of this semester but for the second semester in spring, she has to find other accommodations.", "NTA -- tell your sister this is not working", "Wow. Your sister is incredibly selfish and entitled. I can see where your niece got that from.\n\nYour sister was buying expensive ingredients and cooking two sets of meals. She knew that before she asked if you would let your niece live with you, but she hid that information. She's not paying you anything for room or board, but she expects you to take grocery money away from your family and time away from your family to buy and prepare food for her adult daughter.\n\nA 19 year-old is not a child. She or her mother should be paying for her groceries, not you. She should cook for herself. If she wants someone to cook meals for her, either her mother should visit and do the cooking, or they should be paying you an amount ***you*** consider fair and reasonable for room and board. Beggars can't be choosers. Either she accepts your hospitality, she provides for herself, or she pays for special treatment.\n\nYour sister can be as enabling as she wants in her own home. She doesn't get to dictate what rules people live by in your home. You are under no obligation to cater to your niece's preference to live a vegan lifestyle, particularly since that aspect was never disclosed before your niece moved in. Frankly, they deceived you and are attempting to defraud you.\n\nYou agreed to let her live with you and share the meals that you make for your family. Anything beyond that is not your responsibility. You are NTA.", "NTA,\n\nUnfortunately this is prbly not going to work. You\u2019re already helping by giving her a place to stay. She needs to understand she chose to be vegan, not fair to force you to adapt more then you\u2019ve already have. Your not being unreasonable", "NTA\n\nI can see why her mom didn't think she was ready to live on her own and needs protection. She's a damn child, coddled by silly parent. The nerve to ask to live with a family member (assuming for free because of the money comment) then complaining that the free food wasn't good enopugh.\n\nThis group makes me so happy I'm from a very small family.", "NTA Your niece is starting university soon. She needs to learn to be self sufficient. It's not that she can't cook for herself, it's she can't be bothered. You are her aunt, not her servant. No one gets this entitled unless they've been catered to their entire lives. When you niece starts school she's going to learn the hard way no one is going to hold her hand and she doesn't fart rainbows and unicorns. She's going to be a little fish in a big pond.", "NTA.\n\nShe's an adult, she can cook her own food.  Moreover she's living there seemingly for free or at a discount, so again she can eat what's provided or prepare her own.  None of this is due to allergies, it's all a choice.  I'd refuse to cook special meals for her altogether.  But based on her behavior, we can 100% tell she's vegan.", "NTA. She 19 freaking years old not 1.9  if you want special crap fix it yourself.", "NTA  \nMy sib and I were cooking by 12. (It was mostly out of self-defense, our mom can't cook for squat.) \n\nIf a 19 yo can't figure out how to open and cube a container of tofu, there's not much you  (or anyone) can do for her.", "NTA.  You've set a reasonable boundary.   Niece needs to learn how to cook some of her own meals, too.  You could also find out what it costs for niece to get a meal plan at her university--most have this info online & easy to find.  Suggest that your niece can eat vegan there, at least for breakfast and lunch.", "Basically Kate's mom has three choices.\n\n1. Kate can move into the dorms.\n2. Kate can drop out of college and move home.\n3. Kate's mom can send Kate money to buy her own vegan foods and she can cook her own meals. Editing to add that since your parents are \"team vegan\" they can also get some skin in the game and pony up extra money for Kate's pricy vegan foods.\n\nStress to Kate's mom that these are the only choices and you will be fine and respectful of the choice Kate and her mom make.  If Kate's mom tries to make any demands outside of those choices keep repeating the only three choices.\n\nNTA but Kate and her mom are.", "NTA - she\u2019s 19. She\u2019s not a small child. If she was living in the dorms she would be expected to figure out all her meals. Whether it\u2019s finding vegan options at cafe or cooking herself.\n\nIf it bothers her that much then her mom can find alternative living arrangements", "NTA she is an adult and fully capable of feeding herself. Her dietary preferences are her own to accommodate.", "NTA. Kate is not a child. She is more than capable of cooking for herself, she's just lazy. Tell your sister it isn't working out due to the entitlement she and her daughter shows.", "Ask you sister to come pick her up and make other living arrangements for her. The entitlement is strong here \n\nNTA", "NTA \n\nFrom reading the other comments, you're basically taking care of 3 children. She gets water, heat, electricity, and food for free. I don't want to be rude, but your sister seems to be an asshole. Why does your niece deserve special treatment?", "NTA. You are already doing your niece and sister a huge favor by providing your niece a free place to stay while she is in school. Most young adults who go away for school are responsible for getting their own meals, whether they go to a school cafeteria or make their meals themselves. \n\nYour niece is an adult, if she wants special meals, she is fully capable of providing them for herself.", "Kate can't cook her own meals and buy her own food? I had to when I went to college? Its not unheard of that a college student feed herself without anyone else having to manage for them? I also needed to buy kitchen essentials when I went to college. (Even students in dorms have table settings in their rooms. And paper plates and plastic sporks aren't budget busters? None of this makes any sense to me, is my only point.)\n\nKate needs an apartment, a dorm room, or another arrangement STAT. You aren't there to romper room her through college.\n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nSeveral things really bother me. Kate does not accept her adult responsibilities to care for herself and her belongings. She expects you to provide special service and attention to her. Opening your home isn't enough, she demands concierge and personal chef services. And what does she offer to compensate for the time, energy and resources she demands? Love?\n\nSecond, she, and your sister, believe it's okay to harrass and berate you. That alone should send her packing, imo.\n\nKate doesn't want to deal with the challenge and inconvenience of a vegan diet in a nonvegan household. She prefers to abdicate that responsibility. Her mom supports her pushing that responsibility onto you with no consideration or communication with you about your willingness to take it on. To them, your serving Kate's convenience is part of the package. The lack of respect for you and your priorities as well as your autonomy is unacceptable.\n\nTheir punishing angry outbursts are also unacceptable. You have the right to require civil and respectful treatment in all your relationships. You certainly don't have to house an adult who treats you in an angry and abusive manner.\n\nLet your sister and Kate know their behavior has proven having Kate live with you isn't working and new housing is necessary ASAP. You should not sacrifice the comfort, safety and privacy of your home and family any longer.", "What are you charging for rent?  For the fee were you offering board as well?  If you were offering board what were the details (number of meals per day, etc).\n\n\nI have a sneaking suspicion they are paying nothing and just freeloading AND expecting custom meals.  If that is the case 100% NTA and I would tell her she can graciously stay rent free (I personally would not offer this but you do you) however they are responsible for their own food if they do not wish to eat the provided family meals.", "NTA. You have your own family to think of and there are only so many hours in the day. It was very generous of you to let her live in your home. You have not excluded her, she has excluded herself with her lifestyle choice. Get your cheap sister to send her money to pay for the vegan diet she wants. She needs to get over this family doesn't take money from family nonsense.", "NTA. She's 19 not 5. She can make her own meals. It might be time for her to find somewhere else to stay. I'm guessing your sister isn't giving you any money to offset the cost of her kid's stay? She's cheaping out on paying for room and board AND making crazy demands for her kid.\n\nFamily does help family, but family also doesn't become a huge burden on family without making efforts to offset that burden.", "Time to move to the dorms", "You named your kids Eve and Eva?", "Do a group chat. \n\nTell them you're providing them with free housing, no contribution to utilities etc. You will NOT cook 2 meals.  She can eat or not that's HER CHOICE. She can buy or not also her choice.  \n\nShe lives with you, you have to provide for her? Ok. Simple solution, She can move out. Also her choice.  \n\nThese are the options. You don't like the options that's ok.  But those are their options.  \n\n*IF YOU WANT TO, only if you want to and they're semi respectful about it, maybe you can cook A vegan meal a week.  There are a lot of vegan meals that are great. Just happens to be vegan. And eating one meal isn't going to malnourished anyone in the house.  \n\nYou're NTA for not catering to her lifestyle.  Veganism is a lifestyle.  Not a medical condition (like peanut allergy let's say) you're not forcing her to eat meat. You're not hindering her from buying oatmilk for her cereal.  You'll never be t a bc you don't bend over backwards do double flips on a string in the mountaintops bc the girl is vegan.", "ESH. \n\nYour sister refusing to contribute to the cost or acknowledging the labor of you\u2019re having to get and cook vegan substitutes is not cool. Additionally, I agree that Kate can and should be in charge of her meals as they deviate significantly from the household diet. Especially when it comes to the larger meals you mentioned, you\u2019re not being unreasonable. \n\nThat said\u2026Your niece isn\u2019t just a random person you\u2019re providing with room and board, she\u2019s a member of your family. You welcomed her into your home because you felt she was a smart, sweet family member. While you absolutely shouldn\u2019t have to go out of pocket on her food expenses or spend extraneous time cooking for her daily, it\u2019s also not unreasonable to see how she\u2019d feel excluded at one off events like a family/friends BBQ. Yes she should know how to make her own meals and as this was at her home she could, but if one of your friends was vegan, would you just give them a bland salad and nothing else? It seems to me that some of your understandable frustration over your sister\u2019s refusal to contribute financially + you having to remind Kate you can\u2019t make full separate meals for her on big family meal days spilled over into this one party. \n\nSince Kate isn\u2019t just a charity case or random boarder, and while 19 she\u2019s still young and *your niece*, I don\u2019t know that you have to hold her to such an exacting standard of your way or the highway, the same way your sister shouldn\u2019t assume that because you all are family, you should just handle this no questions asked. For this to work in its current format, it needs a lot more compromise and willingness to rise past annoyances. And it\u2019s okay if it isn\u2019t workable to suggest Kate live in the dorms! But from the situation as described (particularly the bbq with friends), seems like everyone is acting from simmering resentment vs empathy.", "Your sister should be worried that her daughter will have to find another place to live. Honestly, she needs to get out in the real world. Has your sister always treated you like this?", "She\u2019s how old and can\u2019t fend for herself?!?!? At the ages of all your kids you shouldn\u2019t \u201chave\u201d to cook their meals daily. IF I cook a meal my kids eat it if they want it and don\u2019t if they don\u2019t. If they don\u2019t they are more than capable of fending for themselves - and happy to. Youngest is 16", "Side bar: are those fake names for posting, or did you really name your daughters Eve and Eva?", "NTA. As there is nothing listed about your sister paying you rent, I assume that is the case. You are providing housing for a college student, one who usually would have that expense plus food. Her mother is saving significant money on this, and should be able to contribute for food/ other expenses.", "NTA. She is an adult. Unless this is for medical reasons, it is her choice to be vegan. All choices have consequences to them that one has to deal with. As an adult, she has to learn this lesson and manage. Since her parents aren't paying for room and board for her at the university, they should be able to send her a little money to buy her own food.", "NTA.\n\nI became a vegetarian in middle school. Nobody else in my family was. I made my own food.\n\nYour niece is 19; she can figure it out. She also doesn't need fake meat; lentils and beans are cheaper and easy to cook.", "At what point are you going to tell your sister and niece it just isn't working out? NTA", "Why is vegan food expensive? It's vegetarian food sans dairy, making it the cheapest food there is, unless meat is cheaper than veg in the US.?", "Y'know where they're familiar with folks with many dietary restrictions, and offer plenty of options for everybody?  The university.\n\nLet the entitled niece eat on campus, and let her keep some vegan snacks at home.", "Nope. 19 is old enough to cook your own meals and be responsible for grocery shopping as well. She can\u2019t do it, then she needs to go elsewhere. Your sister was wrong to assume that you will be babying her college aged daughter especially with a completely different diet from what you follow. \n\nNTA", "NTA. I'd provide them with 2 choices. She stays rent free (still saving them a ton of money), and sister pays all of her food and she cooks anything she wants to eat on top of (or other than) what you provide OR she moves out.\n\nPlaying the family card expecting you to have to pay extra or put way more effort into life to placate them is ridiculous. \n\nYou did them an enormous favour, saving them a TON of money while paying out of pocket already, to ask more is entitled.", "NTA\n\nKate is an adult. You are giving her free housing. You are giving her free access to ammendities. You are taking a hit on water, electric, heat, and privacy adding another person. You are refusing to take an additional hit on a dietary restriction you seem to have been unaware of.\n\nAsking Kate to buy and make her own food is reasonable. She is an adult, this is how it works in most situations with an extreme dietary restriction. You and your family are not vegan and will not be making separate meals.\n\nThe only potential concession I would make is if you are making something that could be considered vegan, put some aside before adding non vegan elements. But that's as far as I'd go. Meat substitutes do get expensive if that's the route your niece is gonna take\n\nTell your sister if this is such an issue, maybe it's best your niece finds new accommodations. She's asking your family to change too much of their lifestyle and causing too much tension when they don't. She is not a considerate guest or tenant in your house", "My parents would have killed me for being so rude as to complain about what I was eating while living in someone else's home. NTA. Her mother and your parents certainly are for raising such an entitled person.", "NTA\n\nYour niece is old enough to get a part-time job to help her buy her own ingredients for a vegan meal.\n\nIf there is not enough vegan food for her to eat, feel free to encourage her to get up off her lazy ass and make herself some more food.\n\nYou are not her maid nor her servant nor a cook who spends all day slaving away in the kitchen to cook two separate meals.\n\nIf your sister and parents don't  or refuse to understand, feel free to come and get her and pay for her to stay in some place else.\n\nOr provide her with extra money to buy her own food.", "NTA, if she was living on her own she would have had to figure it out. They asked you to let her stay hoping that you would do for her what her mom did, without even giving you advance warning. The true AH is your sister for not making sure her daughter had some independence before leaving the nest. When my kids were old enough, if they said they didn't like something, I told them they were welcome to cook whatever they did want. One of my daughters decided to go vegan (for about 2 weeks lol) I got her a vegan cook book from the library to get her started.", "She is welcome to live in the dorms.", "I was expecting the niece to be 9 years old.\nShe is 19! Yeah she's still a child but a grown up one. She can and should try to cook for herself, girl is in college away from home now. Absolutely NTA.", "So.... she's staying at your house and saving your sister tons of money, and your sister won't pay for her daughter's food? The hell?   Freeloaders don't get the right to complain.  You're already paying for the extra electricity/water/etc that she uses, hell no you ain't gonna be her frickin' personal chef, too.\n\nShe's a guest, but she sure isn't the Queen.  They don't have the right to demand you change the way you run your household if they're not contributing diddly squat to it.\n\nMASSIVE NTA, but your sister is definitely an AH.", "Suggestion: sus pays for meal delivery like Hello Fresh style so nice 1. Learns to cook more AND can have her vegan meals.", "Free room.\n\nFree board.\n\nFree laundry.\n\nFree coffee.\n\nFree butler/chef.\n\nYour sister is free from her adult daughter.\n\nThe only one not free is you.", "NTA\n\nKate is an adult. She CHOSE to become vegan.

I make one meal period. You don\u2019t eat it make it yourself. Vegan cooking requires time and money great lifestyle and healthy but your kitchen isn\u2019t a restaurant.", "NTA - I was veggie for a decade I made my own meals. She is an adult", "I think, for all concerned, that you niece will be much, much happier in the dorm and using the university dining facility - as I'm sure they provide meals and snacks that your niece will not have to put effort into preparing.  Her parents can foot the bill, just as they did before this was silently laid at your budget and feet.", "This is part of the reason I stopped being vegetarian.  It a bit of a luxury really.  It must cost quite a bit to have nice meals with all the nutrients you need when you are a vegan.  You can buy lots of terrible frozen, fast foodish options, granted", "I think the bigger question is, was just your niece vegan or your sister's whole family? If it's just the niece, then your sister did you wrong by passing on the unmanageable burden. \"Return to sender.\"", "In my family one meal is cooked. If you don\u2019t like it make your own. No way will two different meals be made. Going vegan is her choice. She needs to leave with the consequences of that choice.", "I turned vegetarian at age 15 and my parents said I could make my own meals if I didn't want what was served. They made modest accommodations (e.g. leave meat on the side instead of mixing in to dish,  if applicable) and I figured it out the rest. Your neice is an adult. She should figure it out.  NTA.", "NTA and this is whole \"family doesn't take money from family\" thing is bull.  \n\nIt's not like she's staying there for a week while sightseeing or visiting over a holiday.  She's living there while going to college. That's long term. That means a 25% increase in the grocery budget if she's not paying for any food.  \n\nAnd is she paying any sort of rent?  If not, tthat means she's got free housing, free utilities (water, power, internet, cable tv), and essentially a free chef if she's eating any meals you've prepared.  Yeah, why pay for the dorm on campus or an apartment off-campus when you have the \"family doesn't take money from family\" rule.", "ESH.  The niece is going too far in demanding full and elaborate plant-based meals on your dime and effort, but I also think you could do more to incorporate tasty plant-based options as part of the regular meal.   Really? A barbecue and she can only eat a plain salad?  That's enough to be a sitcom plot.", "Ehhhhhh ESH\u2026 \n\n1) 19 is definitely old enough to fend for herself, cook her own food, etc. If she were living on campus with a meal plan, she would be responsible for her meals. \n\n2) If your sister was expecting you to feed her child, she should have told you this prior to moving in. Why would this arrangement ever be viewed as anything other than housing with roommates? Obviously the arrangement was intended to have more oversight, rules, & responsibility for transitioning the niece into adulthood, but she\u2019s still a young adult in college that very well could (and probably should) be living on her own (in campus dorms or with college-aged housemates) \n\n3) While I don\u2019t believe you should be responsible for feeding her every meal every day, I would think it\u2019s normal and familial to accommodate her diet for special occasions (special family dinners, BBQ events, holidays, etc). \n\nAs a vegan, I always planned to eat before the event or bring my own food. But, my grandma would always insist on making me vegan options for holiday dinners and family game nights and honestly that made me feel so secure and loved. It was never expected, and always so appreciated. Like, even just typing this made me a little teary with how much I love her and how her inclusion of my diet showed me she loves me. \n\nWith that being said, it sounds like your sister just dumped her kid on you after not preparing her daughter at ALL for any kind of adulthood. \n\nI think the kindest options you have here would be:\n \n1. Consider ending the living arrangement \n2. Accept that your sister dropped the ball, and take your niece under your wing and teach her how to be an adult yourself (take her grocery shopping, teach her to cook, etc). \n3. Fully end preparation of all meals (except special occasions). You\u2019re making pancakes? Okay. If she wants pancakes too, she can make her own vegan ones later. Or pop some frozen waffles in the toaster if she doesn\u2019t feel like making pancakes. Or eat a pop tart. She\u2019ll survive. \n\nI am 100% projecting my own family issues here, but is your home a comfortable environment for her diet and growth? What I mean is, on top of my parents being vehemently against my veganism, they also would make a huge deal and snide comments when I would cook my own food. Comments about it being gross, smelling bad, etc. It made me never feel comfortable cooking or eating at home. \n\nI moved back in with my parents for a year at 28 before moving across the country, and it was STILL so bad that I mostly lived off of vegan frozen meals. As a 29 year old adult who had been independent for a decade!! That kind of environment was just super triggering for me and made me feel so uncomfortable about food. \n\nAlmost everything I learned about food and cooking was facilitated by my grandparents and my aunt and uncle. None of them are vegan, but all of them embraced all kinds of foods and cuisines and taught me transferable skills without judgement. It makes a difference, and you\u2019re in a position to be able to offer this kind of environment too! \n\n\u2026but also your sister needs to be paying you for groceries or your niece needs to get a job.", "NTA \n\nYour get no money for providing room and board. \n\nYour niece should look into a vegan food plan at school.  They might offer one separate from the dorms.  Or your sister can prepare and freeze a bunch of meals and drop them off for your niece.  \n\nThis sounds more like your sister saving money and her daughter is probably asking for more meal money.  \n\nIt sounds like you are being taken \nadvantage of.\n\nAnd your parents need to mind their own business unless they want to supplement Kate.", "NTA. It seems like the niece was planning to move away from home for college before they even contacted you.

Normally I would say it's a dick move to not cater for dietary restrictions or doing the usual thing a lot of people do by going eugh fine here is a burger or a salad while cooking more interesting meals for the non vegans. People are doing so many wonderfully inventive things with vegan food it's really quite fun to experiment and get into it and doesn't have to be expensive if you're not leaning heavily on meat substitutes. But if you're used to meat and dairy and egg sometimes it can take some adjustment and also yeah the substitutes are pricey and very much not the same at all. Especially with eggs. Egg substitutes work ok in baking but for something actually egg centric it's very different. \n\nBut\n\nShe's moving out to study at uni. If she wasn't living with you she'd be in student accomodation I assume and she'd have to fend for herself and cook for herself. So I don't think it's bad for her to have to learn to cook most of her meals herself? Especially if she's presumably getting to stay with you guys for a lot less money than she'd be spending in student accomodation. And that gives her the opportunity to get into being more creative with her cooking and finding things that work for her and being more independent with her food prep. Which is good for her. Also like. You're not making her go hungry it sounds like if she gives you ingredients you can make her stuff but you're not making two separate dinners (which is fair that's a lot of work). Maybe like. You could have one vegan/meat free night a week or every few weeks or whatever that the whole family can share, and the rest of the time she has to sort herself out. Could maybe have got her a burger for the barbecue though. I have a tonne of vegan recipes though I've picked up since cooking for my partner that are genuinely really good and varying levels of complexity, and theres a lot of non vegan meals that are easy to veganise with meat substitutes so if she needs ideas I can send you some recipes. Learning to cook for yourself is hard. But you do not have to teach her. Her mum should really have done that. Like it's a nice thing to do but you don't have to teach someone elses kid to cook if they have a parent who is perfectly capable of teaching them. If they were fresh out of foster care or she had terrible parents who neglected her I'd say yeah help her learn to cook. But it sounds like maybe her mum has just coddled her.", "NTA.

I think you and your sister are TA. Your sister for not warning you or offering you any money (if she has the means) and you for making your niece feel other, and like she is a burden for wanting decent food. \n\n When I was her age I live with an aunt and uncle during school for one semester. At the time I didn\u2019t really understand what a generous thing it was for them to take me in, and how much it costs to feed someone. Now I\u2019m 30 and I get it. They were definitely paycheck to paycheck, and neither of us were clear on what the boundaries would be before I moved in. My parents had absolutely no money to support me during school. I worked every second I wasn\u2019t at school. I had a 1.5 hr commute and was making like $7 an hr, it barley covered my train pass, lunches, and phone bill.\n\nI had only ever lived at my parents\u2019 and they always fed me, so I didn\u2019t really think anything of my aunt and uncle feeding me. \n\nMy aunt was super loving and generous and would invite me to eat with them. She was the one who allowed me to stay there in the first place. Her husband resented me for the money it would cost them. I didn\u2019t know this moving in, and they never communicated to each other or to me about the inconvenience it was causing them financially. My aunt would never make me feel unwelcome or like a burden because she is a kind person, even it I was throwing off their budget a little.\n\nEven with her kindness, I never felt totally comfortable in their house. I was shy, and didn\u2019t want to be a bother. I didn\u2019t want to take up any more space in their home than the bedroom they offered me. I would NEVER have felt comfortable cooking in their kitchen, or even watching tv in their living room. I literally just used their home to sleep, shower and occasionally eat if they offered me food. It was a weird in between age where I wasn\u2019t self sufficient, but I didn\u2019t have anyone to truly take care of me.\n\nSo it really came as a surprise to me when my uncle sat me down about 3 weeks before school ended and yelled in my face for like a half hour about how I was an ungrateful mooch. I didn\u2019t know what to say, all I could do was sob. They had offered me a place to stay and sometimes food, why would I think it was a problem? I only ate dinner with them a few times a week. I would get my own food for lunch (which would be like an instant rice cup, or bag of popcorn or something soooo cheap bc I was dead broke). I was so embarrassed, and uncomfortable already to have to stay there, but after that conversation I was devastated, and ashamed and I felt so awful. My aunt was so embarrassed, she didn\u2019t know he was angry with me either. \n\nI still feel terrible about this, and I don\u2019t really know what I could\u2019ve done differently. I was desperately trying to make my way out of growing up in poverty to have a good career for myself. \n\nSorry for the long winded story.\n\nMy point is even though she\u2019s legally \u201can adult\u201d she\u2019s in a weird transition period of her life and learning to be self sufficient.

This should\u2019ve been better communicated with your sister. But you guys agreed to take her in, and you should be welcoming and kind to her. Don\u2019t take it out on a kid who probably wanted to stay in the dorms anyway and shame her and treat her poorly for having specific dietary preferences. She might not fully understand burden of the expense or the time or effort it takes to make her a separate meal. But she does understand that you\u2019re treating her as less than. She sees you making elaborate meals for you and your kids and then feeding her a pathetic salad. That\u2019s rude!!! \n\nMaybe you can compromise and make things that have a vegan base and you can mix in cheese, or meat after. I know for a fact that meat, eggs, and dairy are expensive. Buy some frozen vegan \u201cmeat\u201d options and add them to her pasta or rice bowl or whatever you\u2019re making. It it\u2019s literally not that hard!\n\nYou should be arguing with your sister about this not with the kid.  \n\nIf you\u2019re going to offer to help someone out then don\u2019t guilt them for it later!", "No good deed goes unpunished.

I can't eat lactose and my family go out of their way to make sure that there's food I can eat whenever I go to their houses. When we've had people stay with us we make sure their dietary needs are catered for. Have fun with making some different kinds of food! \nI know vegan alternatives can be expensive but they don't have to be. \nIdea, try making a lentil moussaka.

So it is definitely something people need to respect and take seriously, we do not do this for fun, but for the animals.

The ultraprocessed vegan foods, like fake meat, get pricey quickly, and especially in the US, a lot of people who try to \"cook vegan\" go for meals that *look* more like non-vegan meals, which require those ingredients to pull off. There's such a cultural emphasis on meat that I think it's hard for a lot of folks to conceptualize a balanced meal that doesn't use it and still sticks to basic ingredients (beans, grains, vegetables, spices, etc).\n\nBut... it's very easy to eat vegan affordably if you spend .5 seconds Googling. So I always want to face palm when \"the price\" is the reason people are complaining about making vegan food.\n\nIn this particular case, it's possible the niece insists on the higher priced items, ofc.

You weren't inconveniencing him by being fed 2 or 3x a week; he was angry your aunt was doting on you and there were probably other marital issues you didn't know about (possibly aunt using you as an excuse to not have sex?). \nIn OP's situation, Kate is showing no effort at trying to be independent. She is expecting others to take responsibility for her *preferences* and cater to her. They aren't starving her. She's starving herself with *her* own choices. Being vegan is extremely expensive and she needs to learn that. This isn't about her feeling uncomfortable bc she feels like a bother. She IS a bother bc she won't cook for herself when she's been invited to. Your situation was completely different.", "I'm 25 and grew up well with Internet... But kids these days literally live on the net so they have no excuse if they have access to the Internet. Your story is kind of contradictory?

A pizza without cheese?", "The *only* time I've had someone cook something extra is someone who forgot that I'm deathly allergic to shellfish. I asked to just eat veggie stir (to be less of a pain) fry but she, extremely kindly, cooked me a chicken breast to top my meal.", "I like \"flexitarian\" for this reason.", "More people would eat more vegetarian style meals if there wasn\u2019t this \u2018All or Nothing\u2019 attitude about vegetarianism. There is nothing wrong with \u2018I mostly eat vegetarian but eat what people provide\u2019", "Radical vegans can be just nasty about food. Annoying as well. \n\nI wonder if they question my omnivore desires on meatless Monday??  What if I make a whole day without eating anything that a vegan wouldn\u2019t, does that make me a vegan?  Then a bad one if I eat meat?  Lol\n\nSorry. My sister became vegan about ten yrs ago and is holier that tho about it PLUS she became a Christian now we are all sinners PLUS we have horrible diets and are killing the planet with our godless meat eating ways.  \n\nThankfully I have a range of friends with different diets and they are just \u2026.human\u2026 about it.  I love learning different food stuff  from vegans.  Some good stuff.  ;)", "Didn\u2019t you hear?  Unless you eat every single meal with a strict vegan diet you might as well be slitting the throat of a toy poodle.  There can be no exceptions!", "There is an article I read from years ago that sums this up perfectly,). The TLDR of it is basically: The best way to be a good vegan is to be a bad vegan. Breaking the stigma and gatekeeping so other people can more inclined to respect/try to reduce their consumption of animal products has a greater net good affect for animals/environment than any individual could accomplish by being hard and strict to the diet/lifestyle.", "Great that they are flexible with the occasional pepperoni but there are vegetarians who will only eat vegetarian and I will hardly call that an obsession. Eat what you want as long as you are not imposing your lifestyle on others.", "I don't want to live in the world Reddit lives in where the second you turn 18 everyone spits on you and refuses to help you with anything, ever, because \"You're an adult and should know how to do this\" (conveniently ignoring who would be the ones to teach them to do this in the first place) is the go-to for this place.", "Honestly, she probably IS incapable because niece\u2019s mother doesn\u2019t strike me as someone who was even capable of or willing to teach her spoiled daughter basic adult responsibilities, hence shooing her off to live with Auntie to continue to shirk adulting altogether.\n\nOnly bonus for Mommy Dearest is that she pushed off her coddling onto her sister.", "My mom has a rare disease where she doesn't make the enzymes to digest starches and sugar. She's limited to meat, dairy, and most but not all vegetables. She can't go vegan, and even vegetarian is rough. I'd love to see what a militant vegan would try to come up with for her. I go with live and let live. You do you and let me do me.", "You sound like my FDIL - allergic to soy, coconut, AND all tree nuts! She'll never be a vegan.\n\nAnd yes, if she's eating with us, I make all food without her allergens in it. I've even changed my Thanksgiving brine recipe to eliminate soy sauce.", "You shouldn\u2019t have to justify your choices nor reveal personal medical info just to get the militant ones off your back.

They\u2019re just the loudest\u2026", "My mother made sure we knew how to cook spaghetti and chili before we graduated FROM HIGH SCHOOL, so that when she worked, we could occasionally have supper ready for her. 19 is certainly old enough to know how to cook SOMETHING.", "I agree. I was cooking dinner for my family at 10. At 19 I was married with a child. Niece is plenty old enough to cook for herself.", "\nI had to go back and double check her age, wondering if perhaps she was a young teen. \nVegan restaurants and caf\u00e9s make to go dishes for those without the time to cook, people can get subscriptions to recipes and ingredients delivered fresh and ready to prepare for a broad range of different eating options. \nShe\u2019s old enough to be doing some cooking for herself, surely and her commitment to vegan food makes it important that she step up and advocate for this life choice. \nYour sister should be subsidizing any food bills that arise from her special diet.  There\u2019s no objective or rational reason not to do this. \nNTA", "Like seriously, how hard is it to make veggie skewers.", "At the small university (2000 students) I went to, all the dorms had communal kitchens with pots, pans, utensils, spices, etc that everyone could use. Meal prep for the week and keep them in a mini fridge in the dorm room to microwave when needed, I had a friend with celiac disease that did that. And if not there\u2019s the dining hall, and I\u2019ve never heard of a dining hall not accommodating dietary restrictions/preferences, at my school if they were having issues doing so (same friend with celiac got sick a few times) the school arranged to give her credit on their dining plan to use at local restaurants and cut down on swipes for the dining hall so she would have less issues. Every university I\u2019ve seen has a salad bar/wrap station, and a few daily options that never change, and you don\u2019t always have to live on campus to have a dining plan.", "If she was living in a dorm, she'd likely have a meal plan, and the cafeteria would have vegan dishes because they had vegetarian dishes at my tiny HBCU 20 years ago.", "\ud83c\udf36\ufe0f\ud83d\udc0d\n\n*shpicy snek*", "No way, they're a kind of tree!", "Damn you clever person, I was about to say that!!! \n\nWould it be pepperoni or pepper\u00f6ni? \n\nSorry op, this is a tough situation. Your sister is rather generous with your money.  I hope you come up with a solution.  Your sister sending 50 or 100 for the girl's food seems fair. She would be spending a lot more if the girl lived in the dorms or on her own. \n\nAlso, maybe have each family member cook a night. This won't help with the budget, but it will take all that extra work off your shoulders. \n\nThere are a lot of vegan meals out there that can easily be converted by eliminating or adding meat. I'm not saying to do it all the time, but occasionally. If the girl is helpful, I mean. Agree with your sister, her daughter is a roommate. And therefore is responsible for helping the house run smoothly.", "There are actually some vegan \"cheeses\" that... well, I'm not vegan so I have the option to eat regular cheese so I wouldn't buy them instead of cheese myself, but they're workable and not terrible tasting and actually have some meltiness to them. They'd definitely make a serviceable if not ideal pizza.", "A vegan that doesn't want to cook probably shouldn't go crying to mom.\n\nIf one wants to be on a particular diet that doesn't match those they eat with, they need to figure out how to prepare their own food.", "That was kind of her. I would have done the same because you can't help being allergic. It's also a one-time thing, and I wouldn't be able to have you sitting there with no protein or risk eating something that touched the shellfish. This gal wanted all her meals special and free, though.", "They wouldn't be vegan they would be plant based. Vegan is for people that refrain from animal anything not just food.", "I agree. I\u2019m not part of this lifestyle, but just an outsider looking in, it seems very clique-like and judgmental.", "Our daughter turned vegan several years ago. She was living in another city then, going to grad school. I figured it might be a good idea for me to go vegan, to make it easier for her. I couldn\u2019t do it. I gave up after several months. It\u2019s not an easy diet to follow strictly. I enjoyed the vegan restaurants we went to with her, and I liked the vegan meals she made for us at home. It was fine when she came home for visits because I wasn\u2019t the only one. Eventually she moved back home, the pandemic hit and we were eating at home a lot more. It was during the pandemic that she decided that she had had enough of being vegan. We are both pescatarians now, which is much easier. Veganism seems to work best when you\u2019re not the only one because of scale. Groups/ restaurants are more accommodating when it\u2019s more than one or two people. It\u2019s probably why there are excellent vegan restaurants in cities like New York or Los Angeles. Law of supply and demand. There are other cities, as well. Back to OP. It\u2019s difficult for her to adjust to her niece\u2019s diet. My husband started to rebel after awhile. Try cooking pasta plain for the niece and set it aside, then finish making it for the rest of the family, adding in the non- vegan ingredients. Do the same with rice/ stir fry, adding in the non-vegan ingredients afterwards. I understand both sides from first hand experience. I don\u2019t want to call anyone an AH.", "I think some of the judgement comes from the smaller, but vocal minority that make their diet their identity. It's difficult to listen to someone that likes the identity of something but doesn't follow through with it.", "It's not about right and wrong, or about judging someone.\n\nIt's that words have meaning. If you eat meat, by definition, you aren't a vegetarian.\n\nI'm not judging you or saying your wrong for what you eat, but the fact is that you aren't vegetarian if you eat meat.", "Agreed here.  I can't eat pork for medical reasons, and seriously, anything that's had pork cooked on it is very obvious, and still enough to have me praying to the porcelain gods for hours."]}
