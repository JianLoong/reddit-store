We live in a different city from our families due to work. All names are fake for posting. \n\nA few months ago my sister asked me if her daughter Kate (F19) can stay with us since she was starting college in our city. She was scared of her daughter moving away for first time, especially to a big city like ours. \n\nI knew Kate from before Covid time and remembered her to be a smart sweet kid. I discussed with my husband and we agreed she can stay with us. \n\nKate moved in around two months back. She was fine, came home on time, let us know her whereabouts, no partying. \n\nThe issue was with food. She had turned vegan. \n\nNormally I cook for my family. I cook just one meal for all. And we are all diary obsessed people. Milk for cereal, butter in pancakes, cheese in everything. Eggs were our staple. \n\nKate needed separate dishes altogether and we needed vegan substitutes for her. Since those are way more expensive, I told my sister she should give money to Kate so she can buy it. She stared telling me how family doesn't take money from family to feed kids. I told her I would feed Kate same as other kids but I won't spent excess money on her. She said thats fine. \n\nSince her mom won't buy it, Kate started buying plant based substitutes with her pocket money. For dishes like pancakes, I made food for her using her incrediants. \n\nBut everytime I made a huge non vegan meal, she expected me to provide equivalent vegan meals. I drew line at that. I can't spend so much time cooking another meal. She said everyone else got to eat it while she was left with few stuff go eat. I told her she is free to cook for herself and she hated that idea. \n\nIt came to a boiling point last weekend when we had a barbeque dinner with friends. She got upset that her salad was very basic, (it was good only with chicken added) and had nothing else to eat. She complained and I told her she can cook for herself. She got even more upset at that and called her mom crying about how I didn't make any good meals for her and expected her to fend for herself. \n\nMy sister called me yelling at me how I didn't love her daughter and was intentionally excluding her. My parents are also taking their side. \n\nAITA ?", "created_utc": 1694877416, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16ka136/aita_for_refusing_to_cook_separate_meal_for_my/", "score": 2475, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If she was vegan before, did her mother cook her meals? Did she pay for vegan substitutes for her own daughter? I\u2019m just trying to figure out why a 19 year old adult still feels entitled and expects people to cook lavish meals for her with their own time and money. NTA", "NTA\n\nIf they could send her to a dorm, they would have to pay for her food as well.  It was not good enough that you opened you home to her, but you had to cater also?  Not sure which aspect of your family is more entitled, Your niece, your sister, or your parents.  None of them want to spend a dime, but expect you to be the Maitre D at an all inclusive resort, that you don't get paid or tipped.  Maybe the best approach is telling them, the housing situation isn't working out.  There will be more howling until they realize there is no alternative that will cost them less. For some everything is never enough.", "INFO: Are you getting money for room & board?\n\nEdited to add judgement: NTA. You should not have to pay extra on top of what you\u2019re already providing.", "NTA. You aren't her maid or private chef. You are putting a roof over her head, and that is where your responsibilities end. If she wants to follow a specific diet, she can cook for herself or toodle off back to her mother.", "NTA\u2026what would she have done if she was living in the dorms or off campus?  Your sister should have told you upfront that her daughter is a vegan so that you could have made an informed decision,   \n\nYour niece is 19 and should be able to make meals for herself.  Your sister needs to stop expecting you to cater to her child.  If her daughter was staying in a dorm, they\u2019d have to pay for meals so not sure why she\u2019d say that family doesn\u2019t take money from family to feed kids.  This is a situation where your niece chose to be vegan and vegan options can get pricey.  \n\nYour sister and her daughter both seem quite entitled. Tell your sister that you will house her daughter  until the end of this semester but for the second semester in spring, she has to find other accommodations.", "NTA -- tell your sister this is not working", "Wow. Your sister is incredibly selfish and entitled. I can see where your niece got that from.\n\nYour sister was buying expensive ingredients and cooking two sets of meals. She knew that before she asked if you would let your niece live with you, but she hid that information. She's not paying you anything for room or board, but she expects you to take grocery money away from your family and time away from your family to buy and prepare food for her adult daughter.\n\nA 19 year-old is not a child. She or her mother should be paying for her groceries, not you. She should cook for herself. If she wants someone to cook meals for her, either her mother should visit and do the cooking, or they should be paying you an amount ***you*** consider fair and reasonable for room and board. Beggars can't be choosers. Either she accepts your hospitality, she provides for herself, or she pays for special treatment.\n\nYour sister can be as enabling as she wants in her own home. She doesn't get to dictate what rules people live by in your home. You are under no obligation to cater to your niece's preference to live a vegan lifestyle, particularly since that aspect was never disclosed before your niece moved in. Frankly, they deceived you and are attempting to defraud you.\n\nYou agreed to let her live with you and share the meals that you make for your family. Anything beyond that is not your responsibility. You are NTA.", "NTA,\n\nUnfortunately this is prbly not going to work. You\u2019re already helping by giving her a place to stay. She needs to understand she chose to be vegan, not fair to force you to adapt more then you\u2019ve already have. Your not being unreasonable", "NTA\n\nI can see why her mom didn't think she was ready to live on her own and needs protection. She's a damn child, coddled by silly parent. The nerve to ask to live with a family member (assuming for free because of the money comment) then complaining that the free food wasn't good enopugh.\n\nThis group makes me so happy I'm from a very small family.", "NTA Your niece is starting university soon. She needs to learn to be self sufficient. It's not that she can't cook for herself, it's she can't be bothered. You are her aunt, not her servant. No one gets this entitled unless they've been catered to their entire lives. When you niece starts school she's going to learn the hard way no one is going to hold her hand and she doesn't fart rainbows and unicorns. She's going to be a little fish in a big pond.", "NTA.\n\nShe's an adult, she can cook her own food.  Moreover she's living there seemingly for free or at a discount, so again she can eat what's provided or prepare her own.  None of this is due to allergies, it's all a choice.  I'd refuse to cook special meals for her altogether.  But based on her behavior, we can 100% tell she's vegan.", "NTA. She 19 freaking years old not 1.9  if you want special crap fix it yourself.", "NTA  \nMy sib and I were cooking by 12.

You've set a reasonable boundary.   Niece needs to learn how to cook some of her own meals, too.  You could also find out what it costs for niece to get a meal plan at her university--most have this info online & easy to find.  Suggest that your niece can eat vegan there, at least for breakfast and lunch.", "Basically Kate's mom has three choices.\n\n1. Kate can move into the dorms.\n2. Kate can drop out of college and move home.\n3. Kate's mom can send Kate money to buy her own vegan foods and she can cook her own meals. Editing to add that since your parents are \"team vegan\" they can also get some skin in the game and pony up extra money for Kate's pricy vegan foods.\n\nStress to Kate's mom that these are the only choices and you will be fine and respectful of the choice Kate and her mom make.  If Kate's mom tries to make any demands outside of those choices keep repeating the only three choices.\n\nNTA but Kate and her mom are.", "NTA - she\u2019s 19. She\u2019s not a small child. If she was living in the dorms she would be expected to figure out all her meals. Whether it\u2019s finding vegan options at cafe or cooking herself.\n\nIf it bothers her that much then her mom can find alternative living arrangements", "NTA she is an adult and fully capable of feeding herself. Her dietary preferences are her own to accommodate.", "NTA. Kate is not a child. She is more than capable of cooking for herself, she's just lazy. Tell your sister it isn't working out due to the entitlement she and her daughter shows.", "Ask you sister to come pick her up and make other living arrangements for her. The entitlement is strong here \n\nNTA", "NTA \n\nFrom reading the other comments, you're basically taking care of 3 children. She gets water, heat, electricity, and food for free. I don't want to be rude, but your sister seems to be an asshole. Why does your niece deserve special treatment?", "NTA. You are already doing your niece and sister a huge favor by providing your niece a free place to stay while she is in school. Most young adults who go away for school are responsible for getting their own meals, whether they go to a school cafeteria or make their meals themselves. \n\nYour niece is an adult, if she wants special meals, she is fully capable of providing them for herself.", "Kate can't cook her own meals and buy her own food? I had to when I went to college? Its not unheard of that a college student feed herself without anyone else having to manage for them? I also needed to buy kitchen essentials when I went to college. (Even students in dorms have table settings in their rooms. And paper plates and plastic sporks aren't budget busters? None of this makes any sense to me, is my only point.)\n\nKate needs an apartment, a dorm room, or another arrangement STAT. You aren't there to romper room her through college.\n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nSeveral things really bother me. Kate does not accept her adult responsibilities to care for herself and her belongings. She expects you to provide special service and attention to her. Opening your home isn't enough, she demands concierge and personal chef services. And what does she offer to compensate for the time, energy and resources she demands? Love?\n\nSecond, she, and your sister, believe it's okay to harrass and berate you. That alone should send her packing, imo.\n\nKate doesn't want to deal with the challenge and inconvenience of a vegan diet in a nonvegan household. She prefers to abdicate that responsibility. Her mom supports her pushing that responsibility onto you with no consideration or communication with you about your willingness to take it on. To them, your serving Kate's convenience is part of the package. The lack of respect for you and your priorities as well as your autonomy is unacceptable.\n\nTheir punishing angry outbursts are also unacceptable. You have the right to require civil and respectful treatment in all your relationships. You certainly don't have to house an adult who treats you in an angry and abusive manner.\n\nLet your sister and Kate know their behavior has proven having Kate live with you isn't working and new housing is necessary ASAP. You should not sacrifice the comfort, safety and privacy of your home and family any longer.", "What are you charging for rent?  For the fee were you offering board as well?  If you were offering board what were the details (number of meals per day, etc).\n\n\nI have a sneaking suspicion they are paying nothing and just freeloading AND expecting custom meals.  If that is the case 100% NTA and I would tell her she can graciously stay rent free (I personally would not offer this but you do you) however they are responsible for their own food if they do not wish to eat the provided family meals.", "NTA. You have your own family to think of and there are only so many hours in the day. It was very generous of you to let her live in your home. You have not excluded her, she has excluded herself with her lifestyle choice. Get your cheap sister to send her money to pay for the vegan diet she wants. She needs to get over this family doesn't take money from family nonsense.", "NTA. She's 19 not 5. She can make her own meals. It might be time for her to find somewhere else to stay. I'm guessing your sister isn't giving you any money to offset the cost of her kid's stay? She's cheaping out on paying for room and board AND making crazy demands for her kid.\n\nFamily does help family, but family also doesn't become a huge burden on family without making efforts to offset that burden.", "Time to move to the dorms", "You named your kids Eve and Eva?", "Do a group chat. \n\nTell them you're providing them with free housing, no contribution to utilities etc. You will NOT cook 2 meals.  She can eat or not that's HER CHOICE. She can buy or not also her choice.  \n\nShe lives with you, you have to provide for her? Ok. Simple solution, She can move out. Also her choice.  \n\nThese are the options. You don't like the options that's ok.  But those are their options.  \n\n*IF YOU WANT TO, only if you want to and they're semi respectful about it, maybe you can cook A vegan meal a week.  There are a lot of vegan meals that are great. Just happens to be vegan. And eating one meal isn't going to malnourished anyone in the house.  \n\nYou're NTA for not catering to her lifestyle.  Veganism is a lifestyle.  Not a medical condition (like peanut allergy let's say) you're not forcing her to eat meat. You're not hindering her from buying oatmilk for her cereal.  You'll never be t a bc you don't bend over backwards do double flips on a string in the mountaintops bc the girl is vegan.", "ESH. \n\nYour sister refusing to contribute to the cost or acknowledging the labor of you\u2019re having to get and cook vegan substitutes is not cool. Additionally, I agree that Kate can and should be in charge of her meals as they deviate significantly from the household diet. Especially when it comes to the larger meals you mentioned, you\u2019re not being unreasonable. \n\nThat said\u2026Your niece isn\u2019t just a random person you\u2019re providing with room and board, she\u2019s a member of your family. You welcomed her into your home because you felt she was a smart, sweet family member. While you absolutely shouldn\u2019t have to go out of pocket on her food expenses or spend extraneous time cooking for her daily, it\u2019s also not unreasonable to see how she\u2019d feel excluded at one off events like a family/friends BBQ. Yes she should know how to make her own meals and as this was at her home she could, but if one of your friends was vegan, would you just give them a bland salad and nothing else? It seems to me that some of your understandable frustration over your sister\u2019s refusal to contribute financially + you having to remind Kate you can\u2019t make full separate meals for her on big family meal days spilled over into this one party. \n\nSince Kate isn\u2019t just a charity case or random boarder, and while 19 she\u2019s still young and *your niece*, I don\u2019t know that you have to hold her to such an exacting standard of your way or the highway, the same way your sister shouldn\u2019t assume that because you all are family, you should just handle this no questions asked. For this to work in its current format, it needs a lot more compromise and willingness to rise past annoyances. And it\u2019s okay if it isn\u2019t workable to suggest Kate live in the dorms! But from the situation as described (particularly the bbq with friends), seems like everyone is acting from simmering resentment vs empathy.", "Your sister should be worried that her daughter will have to find another place to live. Honestly, she needs to get out in the real world. Has your sister always treated you like this?", "She\u2019s how old and can\u2019t fend for herself?!?!? At the ages of all your kids you shouldn\u2019t \u201chave\u201d to cook their meals daily. IF I cook a meal my kids eat it if they want it and don\u2019t if they don\u2019t. If they don\u2019t they are more than capable of fending for themselves - and happy to. Youngest is 16", "Side bar: are those fake names for posting, or did you really name your daughters Eve and Eva?", "NTA. As there is nothing listed about your sister paying you rent, I assume that is the case. You are providing housing for a college student, one who usually would have that expense plus food. Her mother is saving significant money on this, and should be able to contribute for food/ other expenses.", "NTA. She is an adult. Unless this is for medical reasons, it is her choice to be vegan. All choices have consequences to them that one has to deal with. As an adult, she has to learn this lesson and manage. Since her parents aren't paying for room and board for her at the university, they should be able to send her a little money to buy her own food.", "NTA.\n\nI became a vegetarian in middle school. Nobody else in my family was. I made my own food.\n\nYour niece is 19; she can figure it out. She also doesn't need fake meat; lentils and beans are cheaper and easy to cook.", "At what point are you going to tell your sister and niece it just isn't working out? NTA", "Why is vegan food expensive? It's vegetarian food sans dairy, making it the cheapest food there is, unless meat is cheaper than veg in the US.?", "Y'know where they're familiar with folks with many dietary restrictions, and offer plenty of options for everybody?  The university.\n\nLet the entitled niece eat on campus, and let her keep some vegan snacks at home.", "Nope. 19 is old enough to cook your own meals and be responsible for grocery shopping as well. She can\u2019t do it, then she needs to go elsewhere. Your sister was wrong to assume that you will be babying her college aged daughter especially with a completely different diet from what you follow. \n\nNTA", "NTA. I'd provide them with 2 choices. She stays rent free (still saving them a ton of money), and sister pays all of her food and she cooks anything she wants to eat on top of (or other than) what you provide OR she moves out.\n\nPlaying the family card expecting you to have to pay extra or put way more effort into life to placate them is ridiculous. \n\nYou did them an enormous favour, saving them a TON of money while paying out of pocket already, to ask more is entitled.", "NTA\n\nKate is an adult. You are giving her free housing. You are giving her free access to ammendities. You are taking a hit on water, electric, heat, and privacy adding another person. You are refusing to take an additional hit on a dietary restriction you seem to have been unaware of.\n\nAsking Kate to buy and make her own food is reasonable. She is an adult, this is how it works in most situations with an extreme dietary restriction. You and your family are not vegan and will not be making separate meals.\n\nThe only potential concession I would make is if you are making something that could be considered vegan, put some aside before adding non vegan elements. But that's as far as I'd go. Meat substitutes do get expensive if that's the route your niece is gonna take\n\nTell your sister if this is such an issue, maybe it's best your niece finds new accommodations. She's asking your family to change too much of their lifestyle and causing too much tension when they don't. She is not a considerate guest or tenant in your house", "My parents would have killed me for being so rude as to complain about what I was eating while living in someone else's home. NTA. Her mother and your parents certainly are for raising such an entitled person.", "NTA\n\nYour niece is old enough to get a part-time job to help her buy her own ingredients for a vegan meal.\n\nIf there is not enough vegan food for her to eat, feel free to encourage her to get up off her lazy ass and make herself some more food.\n\nYou are not her maid nor her servant nor a cook who spends all day slaving away in the kitchen to cook two separate meals.\n\nIf your sister and parents don't  or refuse to understand, feel free to come and get her and pay for her to stay in some place else.\n\nOr provide her with extra money to buy her own food.", "NTA, if she was living on her own she would have had to figure it out. They asked you to let her stay hoping that you would do for her what her mom did, without even giving you advance warning. The true AH is your sister for not making sure her daughter had some independence before leaving the nest. When my kids were old enough, if they said they didn't like something, I told them they were welcome to cook whatever they did want. One of my daughters decided to go vegan (for about 2 weeks lol) I got her a vegan cook book from the library to get her started.", "She is welcome to live in the dorms.", "I was expecting the niece to be 9 years old.\nShe is 19! Yeah she's still a child but a grown up one. She can and should try to cook for herself, girl is in college away from home now. Absolutely NTA.", "So.... she's staying at your house and saving your sister tons of money, and your sister won't pay for her daughter's food? The hell?   Freeloaders don't get the right to complain.  You're already paying for the extra electricity/water/etc that she uses, hell no you ain't gonna be her frickin' personal chef, too.\n\nShe's a guest, but she sure isn't the Queen.  They don't have the right to demand you change the way you run your household if they're not contributing diddly squat to it.\n\nMASSIVE NTA, but your sister is definitely an AH.", "Suggestion: sus pays for meal delivery like Hello Fresh style so nice 1. Learns to cook more AND can have her vegan meals.", "Free room.\n\nFree board.\n\nFree laundry.\n\nFree coffee.\n\nFree butler/chef.\n\nYour sister is free from her adult daughter.\n\nThe only one not free is you.", "NTA\n\nKate is an adult.

Vegan cooking requires time and money great lifestyle and healthy but your kitchen isn\u2019t a restaurant.", "NTA - I was veggie for a decade I made my own meals. She is an adult", "I think, for all concerned, that you niece will be much, much happier in the dorm and using the university dining facility - as I'm sure they provide meals and snacks that your niece will not have to put effort into preparing.  Her parents can foot the bill, just as they did before this was silently laid at your budget and feet.", "This is part of the reason I stopped being vegetarian.  It a bit of a luxury really.  It must cost quite a bit to have nice meals with all the nutrients you need when you are a vegan.  You can buy lots of terrible frozen, fast foodish options, granted", "I think the bigger question is, was just your niece vegan or your sister's whole family?

NTA.", "NTA and this is whole \"family doesn't take money from family\" thing is bull.  \n\nIt's not like she's staying there for a week while sightseeing or visiting over a holiday.  She's living there while going to college. That's long term. That means a 25% increase in the grocery budget if she's not paying for any food.  \n\nAnd is she paying any sort of rent?  If not, tthat means she's got free housing, free utilities (water, power, internet, cable tv), and essentially a free chef if she's eating any meals you've prepared.  Yeah, why pay for the dorm on campus or an apartment off-campus when you have the \"family doesn't take money from family\" rule.", "ESH.  The niece is going too far in demanding full and elaborate plant-based meals on your dime and effort, but I also think you could do more to incorporate tasty plant-based options as part of the regular meal.   Really? A barbecue and she can only eat a plain salad?  That's enough to be a sitcom plot.", "Ehhhhhh ESH\u2026 \n\n1) 19 is definitely old enough to fend for herself, cook her own food, etc. If she were living on campus with a meal plan, she would be responsible for her meals. \n\n2) If your sister was expecting you to feed her child, she should have told you this prior to moving in. Why would this arrangement ever be viewed as anything other than housing with roommates? Obviously the arrangement was intended to have more oversight, rules, & responsibility for transitioning the niece into adulthood, but she\u2019s still a young adult in college that very well could (and probably should) be living on her own (in campus dorms or with college-aged housemates) \n\n3) While I don\u2019t believe you should be responsible for feeding her every meal every day, I would think it\u2019s normal and familial to accommodate her diet for special occasions (special family dinners, BBQ events, holidays, etc). \n\nAs a vegan, I always planned to eat before the event or bring my own food. But, my grandma would always insist on making me vegan options for holiday dinners and family game nights and honestly that made me feel so secure and loved. It was never expected, and always so appreciated. Like, even just typing this made me a little teary with how much I love her and how her inclusion of my diet showed me she loves me. \n\nWith that being said, it sounds like your sister just dumped her kid on you after not preparing her daughter at ALL for any kind of adulthood. \n\nI think the kindest options you have here would be:\n \n1. Consider ending the living arrangement \n2. Accept that your sister dropped the ball, and take your niece under your wing and teach her how to be an adult yourself (take her grocery shopping, teach her to cook, etc). \n3. Fully end preparation of all meals (except special occasions). You\u2019re making pancakes? Okay. If she wants pancakes too, she can make her own vegan ones later. Or pop some frozen waffles in the toaster if she doesn\u2019t feel like making pancakes. Or eat a pop tart. She\u2019ll survive. \n\nI am 100% projecting my own family issues here, but is your home a comfortable environment for her diet and growth? What I mean is, on top of my parents being vehemently against my veganism, they also would make a huge deal and snide comments when I would cook my own food. Comments about it being gross, smelling bad, etc. It made me never feel comfortable cooking or eating at home. \n\nI moved back in with my parents for a year at 28 before moving across the country, and it was STILL so bad that I mostly lived off of vegan frozen meals. As a 29 year old adult who had been independent for a decade!! That kind of environment was just super triggering for me and made me feel so uncomfortable about food. \n\nAlmost everything I learned about food and cooking was facilitated by my grandparents and my aunt and uncle. None of them are vegan, but all of them embraced all kinds of foods and cuisines and taught me transferable skills without judgement. It makes a difference, and you\u2019re in a position to be able to offer this kind of environment too! \n\n\u2026but also your sister needs to be paying you for groceries or your niece needs to get a job.", "NTA \n\nYour get no money for providing room and board. \n\nYour niece should look into a vegan food plan at school.  They might offer one separate from the dorms.  Or your sister can prepare and freeze a bunch of meals and drop them off for your niece.  \n\nThis sounds more like your sister saving money and her daughter is probably asking for more meal money.  \n\nIt sounds like you are being taken \nadvantage of.\n\nAnd your parents need to mind their own business unless they want to supplement Kate.", "NTA.

Once I heard that the entitlement just came flowing out. Mom ought to be giving money to house her too.  Does she expect you to drive her to school and pick her up as well?", "NTA. Normally I would say it's a dick move to not cater for dietary restrictions or doing the usual thing a lot of people do by going eugh fine here is a burger or a salad while cooking more interesting meals for the non vegans. People are doing so many wonderfully inventive things with vegan food it's really quite fun to experiment and get into it and doesn't have to be expensive if you're not leaning heavily on meat substitutes. But if you're used to meat and dairy and egg sometimes it can take some adjustment and also yeah the substitutes are pricey and very much not the same at all. Especially with eggs. Egg substitutes work ok in baking but for something actually egg centric it's very different. \n\nBut\n\nShe's moving out to study at uni. If she wasn't living with you she'd be in student accomodation I assume and she'd have to fend for herself and cook for herself. So I don't think it's bad for her to have to learn to cook most of her meals herself? Especially if she's presumably getting to stay with you guys for a lot less money than she'd be spending in student accomodation. And that gives her the opportunity to get into being more creative with her cooking and finding things that work for her and being more independent with her food prep. Which is good for her. Also like. You're not making her go hungry it sounds like if she gives you ingredients you can make her stuff but you're not making two separate dinners (which is fair that's a lot of work). Maybe like. You could have one vegan/meat free night a week or every few weeks or whatever that the whole family can share, and the rest of the time she has to sort herself out. Could maybe have got her a burger for the barbecue though. I have a tonne of vegan recipes though I've picked up since cooking for my partner that are genuinely really good and varying levels of complexity, and theres a lot of non vegan meals that are easy to veganise with meat substitutes so if she needs ideas I can send you some recipes. Learning to cook for yourself is hard. But you do not have to teach her. Her mum should really have done that. Like it's a nice thing to do but you don't have to teach someone elses kid to cook if they have a parent who is perfectly capable of teaching them. If they were fresh out of foster care or she had terrible parents who neglected her I'd say yeah help her learn to cook. But it sounds like maybe her mum has just coddled her.", "NTA.

I think you and your sister are TA. Your sister for not warning you or offering you any money (if she has the means) and you for making your niece feel other, and like she is a burden for wanting decent food. \n\n When I was her age I live with an aunt and uncle during school for one semester. At the time I didn\u2019t really understand what a generous thing it was for them to take me in, and how much it costs to feed someone. Now I\u2019m 30 and I get it. They were definitely paycheck to paycheck, and neither of us were clear on what the boundaries would be before I moved in. My parents had absolutely no money to support me during school. I worked every second I wasn\u2019t at school. I had a 1.5 hr commute and was making like $7 an hr, it barley covered my train pass, lunches, and phone bill.\n\nI had only ever lived at my parents\u2019 and they always fed me, so I didn\u2019t really think anything of my aunt and uncle feeding me. \n\nMy aunt was super loving and generous and would invite me to eat with them. She was the one who allowed me to stay there in the first place. Her husband resented me for the money it would cost them. I didn\u2019t know this moving in, and they never communicated to each other or to me about the inconvenience it was causing them financially. My aunt would never make me feel unwelcome or like a burden because she is a kind person, even it I was throwing off their budget a little.\n\nEven with her kindness, I never felt totally comfortable in their house. I was shy, and didn\u2019t want to be a bother. I didn\u2019t want to take up any more space in their home than the bedroom they offered me. I would NEVER have felt comfortable cooking in their kitchen, or even watching tv in their living room. I literally just used their home to sleep, shower and occasionally eat if they offered me food. It was a weird in between age where I wasn\u2019t self sufficient, but I didn\u2019t have anyone to truly take care of me.\n\nSo it really came as a surprise to me when my uncle sat me down about 3 weeks before school ended and yelled in my face for like a half hour about how I was an ungrateful mooch. I didn\u2019t know what to say, all I could do was sob. They had offered me a place to stay and sometimes food, why would I think it was a problem? I only ate dinner with them a few times a week. I would get my own food for lunch (which would be like an instant rice cup, or bag of popcorn or something soooo cheap bc I was dead broke). I was so embarrassed, and uncomfortable already to have to stay there, but after that conversation I was devastated, and ashamed and I felt so awful. My aunt was so embarrassed, she didn\u2019t know he was angry with me either. \n\nI still feel terrible about this, and I don\u2019t really know what I could\u2019ve done differently. I was desperately trying to make my way out of growing up in poverty to have a good career for myself. \n\nSorry for the long winded story.\n\nMy point is even though she\u2019s legally \u201can adult\u201d she\u2019s in a weird transition period of her life and learning to be self sufficient. She probably doesn\u2019t make a lot of money herself. She probably already feels awkward staying in your home. She probably doesn\u2019t feel comfortable helping herself and cooking in your kitchen. This should\u2019ve been better communicated with your sister. But you guys agreed to take her in, and you should be welcoming and kind to her. Don\u2019t take it out on a kid who probably wanted to stay in the dorms anyway and shame her and treat her poorly for having specific dietary preferences. She might not fully understand burden of the expense or the time or effort it takes to make her a separate meal. But she does understand that you\u2019re treating her as less than. She sees you making elaborate meals for you and your kids and then feeding her a pathetic salad. That\u2019s rude!!! \n\nMaybe you can compromise and make things that have a vegan base and you can mix in cheese, or meat after. I know for a fact that meat, eggs, and dairy are expensive. Buy some frozen vegan \u201cmeat\u201d options and add them to her pasta or rice bowl or whatever you\u2019re making. It it\u2019s literally not that hard!\n\nYou should be arguing with your sister about this not with the kid.  \n\nIf you\u2019re going to offer to help someone out then don\u2019t guilt them for it later!", "No good deed goes unpunished.

I can't eat lactose and my family go out of their way to make sure that there's food I can eat whenever I go to their houses. When we've had people stay with us we make sure their dietary needs are catered for. Have fun with making some different kinds of food! \nI know vegan alternatives can be expensive but they don't have to be. \nIdea, try making a lentil moussaka.

What I would do, personally, is give 30 days notice that niece needs to move to the dorms or find other accommodations unless you receive rent and she cooks her own meals.)", "So let me guess, sister is just cheap, not worried about Kate being away from home. Time to draw up a housing and meal plan contract! NTA  at all.", "Honestly, I think it's time to send her home ......or better yet, let her live on campus and get to see each what the real world is all about!!! \n\nYour sister is being an entitled AH and apparently, your niece has learned to be just like her!!! \n\nOP, time for them to get a reality check......the world doesn't revolve around either one of them!!", "Time for niece to move to the dorms and dining facility.", "Why did you agree to this?", "NTA - I'm a vegetarian (not vegan, but still) and I never expect others to accommodate my dietary choices. When I'm going to a party, and even some restaurants, I assume there won't be food for me to eat and plan accordingly. I eat before or after a party where I know there won't be much for me to eat, eat side items, which usually have a side dish or salad, and fruit, and can make a little tapas-style meal that way. \n\nIn the case of your niece, as a vegan she should know this even more than a vegetarian would as she's further restricted by ingredients. She's being unreasonable by not making her own food and planning her meals and snacks better, not to mention how immature it is for someone her age to act that way about making her own food. Her mother is taking advantage of your hospitality, your home, and your bank account. She got her daughter out of her home and kitchen and now she's in yours. Either way, your niece is not at all ready for the world and your sister has failed as a parent.", "They are saving thousands by you taking her in.   You aren't saying she can't eat the food you make, just that you won't make a separate meal for her every meal.   \n\nYour niece should either eat what you make or shop/cook what she will eat.", "Seriously your sister is taking advantage. Are you sure she\u2019s not your brother, because she has got some balls!!!", "Please, put your foot down. You are being used! This is not ok. These resources need to go to your own kids but some spoilt brat.", "Wtf she should be paying you for the price of a room in the city you're in, that's crazy ..she's taking the piss and to go on and scold you for not providing meals \ud83e\udd2f the entitlement ..you need to have a serious talk with her because shes really taking advantage, is this the way your dynamic has always been, just giving in, to keep her happy??", "Time for sister to pay for niece to stay in the dorm, then, since your accommodations and meal plan are not meeting her needs.", "Explain your niece that since her mother is unreasonable and they both are ungrateful unfortunately you can't keep her on in your house.", "Simple solution? She needs to go. Why hasn't this decision been made yet?", "You are a saint. I would tell my sister with all of the money they are saving by having her live with you and not on campus, they can provide her a meal plan and groceries that fit her dietary needs. It's not really up to you. You're already giving her a free place to live.", "No, the simple solution is for the niece to find accomodation on her own while she goes to college. She is an adult after all, she should behave like one or be gracious to those that are putting her up (and putting up with her).", "Yes! She\u2019s definitely old enough to feed herself, it\u2019s ridiculous to expect to be fed every night and cooked separate meals?! It\u2019s lovely that they eat together but the girls mother is acting like her daughter is incapable of doing anything for herself", "You can't be sure of that. Everyone knows wild pepperonis are one of the worlds most vicious animals.", "Same. I don't want anyone to cook separate dishes for me. It's not like a food allergy!", "Just wanted to say that I disagree with the people saying you're not a vegetarian because you make the occasional exception.", "You have my respect.  I love that you are able to  adjust and\n you are not obsessionally rigid .\n\n\n.", "fwiw, it's both cheap and easy to make your own pizza at home with no meat.", "The great thing about pizza, toppings can be peeled off at will", "THIS. Every vegan person I\u2019ve ever met never expects us to cater to their diet and will either ask ahead if we will have a vegan option but make it clear that we shouldn\u2019t go out of our way to have one, or they will tell us on their own that they will eat before coming and not worry about them. What would she have done if she had to live on her own, ask mom to ship her premade meals? She\u2019s an adult, she can learn to cook a few basics that she can eat.", "Except being a vegetarian is *not* the same as being vegan. She should still cook her own meals, though", "Hands down best attitude ever.", "Then you are not vegetarian. OP is NTA, but telling someone who is veggie/vegan to eat meat just to be polite is not helpful.", "Uhm sorry but no you're not vegetarian if you eat Pepperoni. Lol what. Op is NTA but telling them to just eat some meat is kind if an ah move. I will get sick if I eat meat. However, I always provide my own food.", "I have a vegetarian friend that will occasionally have chicken broth in things so that if she is accidentally served food with chicken broth or whatever her stomach doesn't freak out on her.", "You're not a vegetarian. You're an omnivore.", "You\u2019re not vegetarian then.", "Agreed. It\u2019s sort of impossible to be entirely vegan/vegetarian even if you tried.", "You're not a vegetarian if you're eating pepperoni. You are an omnivore.\n\nYou eat a vegetarian diet most of the time. But you are NOT a vegetarian.", "Pepperoni is a plant\u2026 ?!", "No disrespect taken and this is a great question! For me, no.  Sanitization though washing and my dishwasher is just fine.  I have a (now) ex and 3 kids. I approach it the same as religion and politics - it is a personal choice.  They were always respectful and supportive of my choice, and I am of theirs.  My kids (all grown now) have said being exposed to my way of eating has influenced them a lot - they\u2019re all produce heavy, not afraid of trying something new, and all generally eat healthy.  It\u2019s the militant vegans that mess everything up.", "When you're cooking for 5 people who are accustomed to eating more protein and dairy etc, vegan cooking is actually quite expensive for a lot of people. Then again if it is so incredibly cheap the 19 year old should have no issues fending for herself. Maybe the vegan can cook a large vegan meal for her family as a thank you to show how cheap and delicious and filling it is to everyone, and then they can all change course together.\n\nIdk this 19 year old is def mentally a kid still but reality sometimes sucks and part of reality is that no one will mother you like your mother.", "Exactly. Time to give a date for the niece to move. Parents can pay for room and board at the school or an apartment.", "Absolutely agree. If niece was going to school elsewhere, they'd be paying rent and food expenses and a whole lot more, so they're absolutely taking advantage.", "Even short term guests usually bring gifts, take you out for meals and generally help out.", "Indeed, niece isn't a guest, she's a freeloading lodger. Epitome of a r/choosingbeggars !", "\ud83d\udcaf!  This 19 year old can make her own meals in a home free of rent. Imagine her out in the world trying to eat on campus lol.", "That is a solution but probably not an affordable solution. \n\nIt is unreasonable expectation and might I add quite entitled to expect her aunt to cater to her dietary preferences as they cost the aunt both time and money. \n\nAssuming the niece is taking out student loans to fund her degree she can apply for additional money to cover the cost of housing and meal plan. Then she can learn what it is like to live independently. Her Aunt is nearby in the event of an emergency.", "Exactly. Kate is going to have to learn to cook her own food at some stage. She's 19, not 9, and OP is not her personal chef. There is perfectly good food on offer, and if that's not good enough, Kate needs to figure out the alternative on her own - not demand that everyone else kow-tow to her.\n\nKate and her mother are getting a smoking deal as it is - free rent and free food? Rocking the boat is a quick way for Kate to find herself in dorms, and ain't nobody going to be cooking for her then.", "Definitely.   \n\nDiet is a personal choice every day. \n\nIf one day a vegetarian or vegan feels the need to eat something  off of their usual diet, it's theier  right and chouse to do so. \n\nBeing rigid in your chosen diet is  fine if you want to but it's not for everyone, and *nobody*  has a right to judge you for it.", "[removed]", "It really is, you only have to be willing to cook for yourself.\n\n I could understand if she was still a child but she is 19! Its her choice.", "That doesn't work with meat toppings. The meat gets cooked into the cheese and there's no picking off the meat residue.\n\nSource: I don't eat pork. Pepperoni pizza, even with the pepperoni peeled off, still reeks of pork.", "That doesn't work if you don't want your food to touch certain foods - you may not eat meat or other foods due to: ethical, religious, and/or allergies. So I think this simple basic thinking is trash. \n\nThe problem here is the niece/aunt did not discuss this before - there are time/cost issues here and it should have been sorted out before. If OP does not have the time/money to accommodate this (totally understandable, also her family is being ridiculous putting this all on her)  - then she can't  - and the niece/aunt should pay for it/niece should cook her own meal OR should she just move out. \n\nFor people who just take toppings off/will be flexible in certain situations - they don't have a serious allergy that impacts their health and/or don't have a strict measure on making this choice (e.g. not eating any meat except when... et al.). \n\nAlso, there is a difference between a dinner guest, or short-term guest vs. a long-term live-in family member.", "Niece could cook vegan dinners for the whole family a few times a week, offsetting the cost of the food by making the meal for everyone. Then she would have to eat what she could for the other days, either eating whatever sides in OPs are vegan, or making her own food. Niece would also learn to cook for herself this way, which it doesn\u2019t seem like she has done often (OP said mom cooked for her previously).", "I mean, technically you're correct.  Technically correct is the least helpful kind of correct.  The world needs 1000x more half-assed vegetarians, way more than it needs 10x more strict vegans.", "Eating less meat is way more helpful than being a purist PITA and turning everyone around you into slavering carnivores out of sheer annoyance.", "> Then you are not vegetarian.\n\nYes. They are. People can have more than one ideology. Ffs. This gatekeeping is what makes the militant vegan/vegetarians.\n\nI agree that they shouldn't be telling a vegetarian to just eat meat (though disagree they're even doing that) but telling someone who eats vegetarian 99% of the time that they aren't vegetarian is extremely dumb.", "Well the niece can just move out.", "I agreed with the above person until the pepperoni part. As someone who doesn't care at all they ate pepperoni and not bothered by them calling themselves vegetarian... But honestly I think it's a good message to say, they're in someone else's house they need to be respectful. Not eating meat no, but appreciating that they've been given free accommodation so they can study, food provided for in the cupboards, all she has to do is COOK, and maybe buy like one or two ingredients to make a vegan version of something. This girl and her mum is beyond disrespectful, ungrateful and entitled.", "I have a friend who is vegetarian but considers refusing a meal that someone has gone to the trouble of making for him incredibly rude, especially if they don't know he's vegetarian. He will also eat meat that is cooked for a group (like a barbeque) \\*if\\* he can trace the source, or knows that his hosts have, to local farms and not via intensive farming that involves animal cruelty. It's a different kind of ethical vegetarianism.", "Perhaps they are picking the pepperoni off and what is OK with them is that it touched the pizza originally?", "Yeah, i have a friend that has never eaten meat because it is against his religion, should be just eat meat now to be polite? Fuck that.", "That's not what Gloomy Shallot wrote, and you know it because it's just 3 inches above.", "Why are people downvoting you for this?? People in there with their silly \"you can have more than one ideology\" yeah but it doesn't make you vegetarian lmao???\n\nI genuinely don't understand how \"vegetarian means doesn't eat meat\" is a controversial statement here. People are blatantly ignoring literal definitions so that they can tell OP she's NTA. She isn't an asshole, but that doesn't mean vegetarians should eat meat to be polite?? Like jfc these \"I eat meat to be polite\" mfers are literally just making it harder for the actual vegetarians.\n\nLike do you know how many times I've had someone tell me that sure, nothing here is vegetarian, but I can eat meat just this once, it's just one time! Like, if you're going to eat meat, that's fine. But don't try and pretend that you're a vegetarian? The fuck.", "Shush. Your opinion isn\u2019t needed here.", "Is a vegan Christian that eats sacrament (assuming the cracker has butter or milk) no longer vegan in your mind?

Lol 25 years ago it was 125 a week for a double room. 110 for a triple. I want to say 275 for a single if they would even give you one. That's on campus for just the room. An apartment within walking distance was 400 a month per bedroom. The campus meal plan started at 2700 for the semester. That was the smallest one there was a 3200 and a 3800. Let me check my math for the average college experience 25 years ago total $5575. Per semester (4 months 3 weeks) that doesn't include extras like going out or anything. And that is rolled in with your college fees. With inflation now jeez. I would guess at least $7575. And I went to a state school. \n\nNTA the sister is saving a fortune. I would go on the school website and find the room and board and meal plan fees then add them up. Show her what the cost could be. Then ask for whatever you want for your expenses, and groceries, and explain that if her daughter wants a vegan diet she is going to have to get used to being an adult and making it for herself.

She's not hosting someone for a single meal, she's got an extra person living there whose parents are refusing to pay for her food and getting upset when she buys her own food.\n\nETA2: and to the person who deleted their comment said they would never be vegetarian if it means they don't get to eat meat sometimes: good. I don't need more people going around being \"vegetarian\" except for bacon or some nonsense. Do you know how annoying it is when someone knows a person who does that?
