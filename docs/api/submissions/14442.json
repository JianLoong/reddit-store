Infact it's even worse than that, you're starving because you're trying to take care of HIS family's dog and he just uses it as an opportunity to rob you to get unnecessary treats for himself. That's not a boyfriend, that's a man who doesn't care about you who you hang around for some reason.

You're spending your limited funds on a flea treatment for an animal that isn't even yours because you want it to be well. Meanwhile he's almost literally eating popcorn to the sight of his partner starving. One of these is not like the other.\n\n(Also just a practical piece of advice, you should have taken that money immediately and spent it on the flea treatment so he couldn't get to it.

And I believe this shows that he is financially abusive and self-centered when you come down to it. I think it's time to rethink this relationship and look at at the alternatives.", "NTA\nThis is his family but you are putting in a lot more effort and resources to make up for the neglect. You could step back and think about how close the effort and energy you put into 1, the relationship and 2. his parents' pets compared to the effort he's making. Maybe you step in to help because it makes you feel good and useful? It's normal to expect appreciation for your efforts and rebursement for the costs. It seems like bf will take without appreciating the gift of time, attn and resources you're pouring into making his life easier. When you point out his inconsideration, he punishes you with anger. \nBoundaries around your time, effort and resources, where you match and don't exceed his effort, and where your time to recharge and rest is protected. That would help stop and rebalance uneven relationships sooner.", "Lose him.", "NTA. Throw the whole man away. He spends money on pizza for himself when you don't have enough money to eat!

Actually I think you should just ditch him take the dogs and cut your losses.", "First tell the parents when they return that you would like to be reimbursed for the flea treatment. When they mention the $50.00, tell them their son used it to treat himself to food (that he did not share with you).\n\nThen get the hell out of the relationship. NTA."]}
