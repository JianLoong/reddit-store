{"id": 3689, "submission_id": "z9nw0g", "title": "AITA for refusing to go on a cabin vacation with my family for Christmas?", "selftext": "I (17F) have split parents (both 37). Since I was three, my mother has lived 1000+ miles away. My paternal family tells me she left me when in reality she lost her job and wouldn\u2019t be able to pay her bills, so she had no choice but to move back to where her mom was since her mother could help her get a job. My father offered to help her move if she signed over full custody. \n\nDue to this, I haven\u2019t seen my mom much growing up, and being raised by a young man with no knowledge of how to raise a girl without a mother is difficult. My mom moved again when i was 14 (same amount of miles, just a different direction). She now lives around 3 hours from my paternal great-grandmother, so it\u2019s been easier for me to see her more often because my family is more willing to see their family and just drop me off with my mom. \n\n\nMy uncle recently died at 35 because of a work accident, and ever since my family has decided they want to be more close knit. They planned this cabin trip for Christmas and was really hoping I\u2019d go. \n\nI so badly wanted to go to this cabin trip, but I already got summer with my mom cut short and wasn\u2019t able to see her for my birthday. This left me with two options; Thanksgiving or Christmas (can\u2019t have both because even one is too much to ask for). \n\nConsidering my mother was planning to go back to her hometown for Christmas, i decided that I should go with her then. This made the most sense because for Thanksgiving i\u2019d get to see my great-grandmother maybe one last time, and for Christmas I\u2019d get to see my other great-grandparents since they\u2019re also getting very old. Reminder, this was NOT an easy decision. That cabin sounds like an amazing time. My paternal family, however, did not like that. \n\nThe first time my grandmother saw me after the decision she immediately started guilt tripping me. She said I haven\u2019t spent christmas with my paternal family in ages (I\u2019ve only spent the last two christmases with my mother. Every other christmas has been spent with my paternal family, and i spent a decade without seeing my mother on any of them.) My grandmother claimed that my cousins friend (my replacement) loved her more and was her new grandchild.  I then got to watch the rest of my family have fun trying on matching pajamas, guilt tripping me, and talking about how much fun they\u2019re going to have without me. No doubt it\u2019s going to be worse after christmas when they\u2019re all talking and go \u201cit\u2019s a shame you didn\u2019t come\u201d. \n\ni literally just want to see my mother. aita?", "created_utc": 1669901299, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z9nw0g/aita_for_refusing_to_go_on_a_cabin_vacation_with/", "score": 92, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your family is being unnecessarily cruel by guilt tripping you here. Go see your mom and have a great time.", "NTA\n\nI want to send you a big hug...no child or even young adult's family should do this to them. THIS is unbelievably shitty. You live with your dad and you presumably get to see his side of the family more often. This sounds like it is your one chance to see the extended maternal side of the family and if you want to do that no one should be asking or guiltting you to give it up.\n\nHave you spoke to your father and asked him to make it stop.. If you have and he won't...\n\nWhat you could do is this (it's mean by the way) She wants to emotionally blackmail and threaten you she deserves everything she gets\n\nWhen Granny does this to you start crying if your a girl, be wet eyed if a boy though crying would be sooo effective if you can bring yourself to do it and say in a quiet voice\n\n\"I am so heart broken......thought you loved me..... I have seen you x times this year and yet unless I am prepared to not see my other grandmother, great grandparents at all this year you say you are replacing me with someone else. You care so little for my feeling that you want me to miss out on possibly my last opportunities seeing them by using such awful emotional blackmail...I guess my emotional and mental welfare doesn't really matter to you. I am so disappointed and hurt I guess I thought I mattered to you more than that.....\"\n\nGet up and leave the room and if they try to talk about refuse to discuss it an further with this line \"I am not prepared to talk about it any further it's too distressing and hurtful, you/she made your/her position extremely clear and I understood and I don't want to and won't go over it.\" It is really important you don't let her or anyone else draw you into a conversation about it after you have had your say...don't let her defend herself or explain it away. \n\nWork smarter not harder.", "NTA shame on them for trying to stop a relationship with your mother you need and want. Go see mom and have a wonderful Christmas.", "So basically they want to treat you like crap & think you should be ok with that? Tell them they've made it clear just how much you mean to them & you will respond accordingly.", "NTA - go see your mother if that's what you want to do, it seems like the only time you get to see her. Ignore their guilt trips... obviously, they have \"allegiance\" with your father. I also come from a divorced family (that handled this stuff a lot better) but my husband's divorced parents forget that the other parent even exists, so I totally get the split.", "NTA. Your mom is back in your life and that's a pretty big deal. It's not wrong to want to at least get to know that side of the family. \n\nYour paternal family is being really petty. Trying on Christmas pajamas at Thanksgiving? What the hell? Guilt tripping you and literally saying they've replaced you? That's so messed up. Personally that would drive me further away.", "NTA and they are treating you badly. This is no way to make someone feel loved or even welcome.", "NTA. Go see your Mom. She's been through a lot and treasures her time with you. Don't fall for the guilt trip. They are being jerks to do that to you.", "NTA If a trip was so important why didn't they schedule it during Thanksgiving when you could be there? Or is the trip some weird way of trying to keep you home for Christmas.", "NTA. Also I would not bother with any of them if they are going to act like that that is fucked up", "NTA - guilt tripping a 17 year old is deeply un-dude.", "NTA. Honestly, they sound like they hate your mother and the fact you want to have a relationship with her. They don't treat you well either. Spend time with your mother. She is just as important as your dad.", "NTA.  You just want to maximize the opportunity to meet and greet as much as the extended family that you can.  How does that translate into being an asshole?  It doesn't.  It's a good plan.  Too bad about the guilt tripping.", "This is a lose/lose decision no matter what you pick.  There is no right nor wrong here with the exception of your paternal side.  It is evident that your paternal side doesn't care for your mother.  They  paid off your mothers bills not to share you with her.   When you were younger they controlled what you did and who you did it with.  As you got older, that is not something they have full control of.   What they have is guilt. Showing you what you could have and what you will be missing.  After the trip, it will be the only thing they will talk about. Saying it was the best vacation ever.  They will even take a picture, with all of them in it from the trip, and put it up.   It is up to you on how you decide to move forward.", "NTA-\n\nI feel you. Also child of divorce. I was also regularly pulled in two directions for the holidays with various levels of guilt. It got to the point that I really hated holidays of any kind because all it meant to me was that everybody was angry with me because I wasn't able to fulfil their expectations while trying to compromise/balance. \n\nOne year, as Christmas approached and the usual conflicting demands came in response to what I told everyone I would try to do that year to balance time- I finally snapped and informed everyone that I would not be attending any Christmas with anybody. I would remain in my college apartment and 'celebrate' with my cat who was the only living being in my life not giving me grief. At first the calls came in telling me I'm an AH. I just responded- and that right there is why I'm not coming and hung up. \n\nA few days later my grandmother knocks on my door. Mind you, I was some 150 miles from her home at my college residence. She comes in and tells me, \"We're sorry. All of us. I've spoken to everyone. You gave us notice of your intentions a few days ago and you received a barrage of impolite and inconsiderate responses. We get it. I'm here to ask you to reconsider withdrawing from Christmas and to inform you that WE WILL ALL be delighted if you could do as you suggested in your original plan, and know that this will never come up again.\" \n\nWe cried and hugged and that was the actual end of it.\n\nAll of that just to say... I feel you. It's so hard when you know that you cannot win. All I can say is do your best to do what you think is right and don't look back. To those who give you grief after the fact I might say- You know I can't be everywhere at once, right? But when some people try to turn a holiday into a reason to give me a hard time and make me feel bad, it makes the future decisions a lot easier. Understanding and compassion would actually be the greatest gift. Is that on offer?", "NTA\n\nYou  are old enough to make your own decisions now, and you have very sound and rational reasons for celebrating Christmas with your mum and great grandparents. Your mum signing over full custody in exchange for financial help to move away sounds like parental alienation and I wouldn't blame you for wanting to move a lot closer to your mum once school is finished.\n\nHold fast OP, state your boundaries firmly and don't accept any crap. A grandmother who manipulates you and replaces you with a cousin's friend at the drop of a hat isn't worth spending any more time with. How is your dad behaving? \n\nHave a wonderful Christmas OP, making memories with your mum. You two can wear matching pyjamas too!", "NTA\n\n\nYou realize your Dad stole your mom from you and now they are trying to do it again.", "NTA. This is parental alienation.", "They aren\u2019t living you. They are competing with your mom and you are the proof that they are winning or losing.  They have had you all these years and apparently made mo effort to support your bond with your mother.  For instance, why did the divorce leave your mother penniless?\n\nSpend time with your mom and enjoy every single minute.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
