Her situation is unforunate, however, it is HER situation. I think you are being fair to give her a few weeks grace while she makes arrangements but fro her to threaten to quit he job out of spite is insane. Your mother and other grandma were very generous with their time, but it was a gift, not a right and your sister needs to start making contigency plans.

Just because she has proximity doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s entitled to access. If I where you, I\u2019d really encourage her to find a M-F job. Plenty of factory jobs are like that.

She needs to work out a permanent child care situation that fits her employment schedule or she needs to change her employment to make that part easier.
