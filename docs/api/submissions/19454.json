This isn't their moment. \n\nIn your friend's particular case, I see why he wanted to do this for his mom as she never got a chance to graduate herself. So your mom heard about this and instead of taking it as the sweet gesture that it was, she thought \"oh here's an opportunity to make this about me\". Just no. Parents are supposed to let their kid have this moment for themselves, and to look on with pride.\n\nAnd yeah, supporting you is kind of her job as your parent.", "NTA. It\u2019s so awkward when people give gifts (both material and of service) and attach themselves to some self-defined return of gratitude they feel they should get. It sours the gift and reveals much about their (underdeveloped) character.", "NTA. If she\u2019s experienced it already, then what\u2019s the point?", "NTA. By wanting to do this, your mother is trying to take your moment and make it about her - she is being selfish. As far as her taking care of you and supporting you throughout school - *that is her job as your parent*! That is the obligation she took on when she decided to have a child.\n\nShe needs to put her ego in check and let you have your moment.", "NTA this was your day. Your graduation. You put the hard work and effort in. It\u2019s nice of your friend to have allowed it but that doesn\u2019t mean you have to. I\u2019m honestly surprised a school even allowed this. I\u2019ve seen it with parents carrying their babies and that makes sense. It\u2019s another obstacle the student faced and overcame but a parent shouldn\u2019t try to take the spotlight from their kid on their day.", "NTA\n\nYour mom is allowed to ask.\n\nYou are allowed to say, \"no.\"\n\nYour mom should respect you enough to let it go.

It isn't the parent's graduation day, it's yours, and you are free to do whatever u want. But at the same time, i understand why she's upset, she did raise u, supported u and took care of u, maybe she just wants some recognition, u should let her down gently by explaining that to her", "NTA.

As someone who has a difficult job (not parenting), I will say that answering the call of duty can perhaps become routine. But that doesn't make it easy. I've read that effective parenting requires a lot of mental discipline to do the right thing in the face of beyond the pale frustrating days.\n\nI believe your mother wants to take an opportunity to get recognition for that. Truthfully you should give it to her. But I fundamentally think you have to do it in a way that feels natural to you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

This one is his.\n\nI agree with you- providing for my kids and supporting them through school and life as they learn and grow into independent people is just part of the job of parenting. Another part of parenting is letting go of control as our kids grow up.... like letting them have stage alone when they reach a big milestone. \n\nI hope your mother gets over her disappointment and appreciates that she raised a son prepared to advocate for himself rather than giving up the recognition he deserves.
