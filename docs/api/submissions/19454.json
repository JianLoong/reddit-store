Focus should be kept on the people graduating.   \nThe only person I\u2019ve ever known who had someone walk with them was a blind student who was being guided, and that\u2019s a totally different scenario.", "NTA. That is weird. If her rationale is the standard, nearly every HS kid would have a parent walk with them--which they don't. She did her job and did it well apparently. Good for her. She had her trips down the graduation aisle already. This is about you.", "NTA it makes sense in your friend\u2019s case because his mom had to give up her chance at education to make sacrifices and emigrate to the US.  Your mother is highly educated so she didn\u2019t miss getting to graduate.  The \u201csacrifices\u201d she mentioned are normal parental responsibilities", "You are so nta here. Let's not literally applaud a fish for swimming. Like come on, what is mom expecting here? The moment you decide to become a parent is the moment that child becomes the priority no matter what. You want applauded and cheered for for doing it, wait till mothers day when it is about you. Not the day that's supposed to celebrate your sons accomplishment. It's your mother who is ungrateful for having this outlook on being a parent and what she has done and sacrificed, not you for expecting her to do what she agreed to when she became a parent.", "NTA.  What a horrendous idea.  It would make me feel like a little kid that couldn\u2019t be trusted to walk and get my own diploma. Your mom is all kinds of wrong.", "NTA \n\nThe situation with your friend was unique and I think it was very special for him to recognize his mom\u2019s actual sacrifices and give her an experience she gave up to get him where he is today. \n\nYour mom likely worked hard for her degrees but having her walk with you at your high school graduation IMO would have made your friend\u2019s sincere gesture of recognition to his mom look like less than it was. \n\nIdeally your mom will get over it.", "NTA\n\nYour mom's mad she couldn't steal your spotlight during a big milestone. That's pretty messed up.", "I would never demand to cross the stage with my child. This is their moment to shine and I wouldn\u2019t dream of making it about me. Especially since I\u2019ve also done it 4 times now. Your mom sounds like she has narcissism issues. NTA", "NTA, did your mom try to compete with you in all aspects or is it just this? Either way this is wrong, it is your accomplishment and your day. I'm a mom and didn't walk my kids. She sounds like a narcissist, you cut those people out of your life if they cross boundaries just an fyi", "NTA\u2026 this is super weird and cringey", "You're mom sounds selfish af..", "NTA. Your mom is weird and sounds like she is trying to steal the spotlight. Tell her she has had three graduations, and no one walked with her. Why can\u2019t you walk alone to celebrate your accomplishments just like she did?", "Um, I\u2019m a prof, have attended more graduations than I can count, and I\u2019ve never seen someone walk with someone.  \n\nYour mom is out of her mind.", "Also, think on this.  If she is such a narcissist she wants to steal OPs shine at a high school graduation, what's going to happen next.  She will make OP sit in the stands while she collects his degree?  She going to be standing right on top of him at the wedding ceremony?  She's DEFINITELY going to demand to be in the delivery room and also that she gets first choice on naming any future children too.\n\nOP, NTA, and this is exactly the time you need to set firm boundaries and stick to them.  Future you will thank you from the bottom of your heart.", "\"I fed you, clothed you, kept a roof over your head - so I am *entitled* to this thing [no matter how you feel or what you say]!\" was a go-to for my parent with undiagnosed Borderline Personality Disorder...\n\n...which is so gross.\n\nEven if the role of parent was entered into hesitantly or unwillingly, it can be traumatic for kids to hear \"well I supported your basic needs so you need to do XYZ for me!\" but it's absolutely a thing with Cluster B (and I'm sure other) parents, and their enabling partners don't typically help.\n\nSuper proud of OP for standing up for himself and hope he's able to continue to set healthy boundaries after reflection and consideration like he did here well into adulthood!\n\nNTA times a million.", "Honestly, I don\u2019t even see how this would work.  I\u2019m in higher Ed too, and I can\u2019t see the logistics of this.", "You're mom sounds selfish af..", "And super annoying for the school admin who'd have to add in \"everyone can have someone walk with them\" to planning. And you know it wouldnt stop there, then everyone would be asking if their pet iguana can walk with them", "NTA, this is your moment.  She can attend as a guest only or not at all.", "NTA and you are right. Your graduation is about you, not her. She was being self centered. Let her pout, she will get over it eventually.", "NTA.\n\nFirst, congratulations! You're becoming your own person. Yes, your parents raised you and supported you and blah blah blah blah they did the parenting they should have done. Your mom doesn't deserve to eclipse what was ultimately YOUR accomplishment just so she can have a little extra attention. She's had her time(s) to shine if she graduated multiple times already and presumably had events like weddings and such.\n\nKeep an eye out for more of these behaviors in the future. Is she going to insist on walking with you at your college graduation, or if you decide to pursue a degree after college? Is she going to wear a wedding dress to your wedding if you decide to get married? \n\nSince you graduated, I am going to assume you're going to college soon. This is a good time to start setting boundaries for yourself as a young adult, especially if you intend to move out on your own. \n\nGood for you for telling her no. It wasn't her place or right and you should be celebrated as your own person, not an extension of her. Best of luck!", "NTA, at all.", "NTA. It sounds like your mother is trying to steal your spotlight. She already had her graduation; she shouldn't get to have yours too. \n\nHonestly, I hate the mindset of giving into unreasonable demands \"to avoid a fight\".", "Glad you didn\u2019t let her walk and steal your shine. Sounds like she makes everything about her\n\nNTA", "NTA. She had her moment of celebration already. Your friend doing that is nice and it is fitting with his mothers struggles. But your mom graduated and was celebrated. Also taking care of u wasn\u2019t a solo job since i see ur father is in ur life AND it is what she is supposed to do. Like she decided to keep u, taking care of you is ur parents job. It\u2019s a bit weird she doesn\u2019t understand why she isnt in the same predicament and weird she wants attention focused on her.", "NTA. Your mom is nuts.", "NTA. This isn't her moment in the spotlight. It's yours and yours alone. She had her time 3 times.", "NTA your mother is projecting her insecurities and perceived failure on her child and attempting to live vicariously through you. Sounds like she needs some therapy.", "NTA - She already had her walks. Did she let her mom walk with her? Secondly...what happens when you go to college? As a parent, you have to learn when to step back and let the child live. Good luck and congrats on graduating.", "NTA - what's wrong with your mom?", "NTA, your mom sounds like a narcissist. My mom would constantly throw the \u201cI took care of you\u201d shit in my face and it would guilt me. Until, I saw how other parents treated their kids, then it infuriated me. \n\nA parent should never, never throw the \u201cI took care of you\u201d in your face. It\u2019s literally a crime if they didn\u2019t, and you didn\u2019t choose to be born, your parents wanted a kid, and they knew what that entailed. She gets recognized for it everyday when you call her title \u201cmom\u201d. I assume you also do stuff for Mother\u2019s Day for her. \n\nIt\u2019s your moment, not hers. You were the one who worked hard, and stressed, and balanced your personal life with your school. Not her. At risk of sounding callous, it\u2019s fucked that she would want to jump in your spotlight. What your friend is doing is sharing the spotlight that he earned with his mom who didn\u2019t get the opportunity. What your mom is trying to do is shoehorn herself in so she can feel validated for doing what is expected of all parents. \n\nSo, yeah, OP, NTA, and I hope you have a good graduation ceremony, and a good time with your friends afterwards. ( I never got to graduate high school, so I always find it cool when people do. )", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPArents walking with their kids is ridiculous, even for the friends mom.", "NTA and frankly I don\u2019t think the school should have let your friend\u2019s mom walk in the graduation either. It\u2019s very sweet that he wanted to do something special for his mom but it\u2019s an inappropriate venue and occasion. Graduation is about the graduates, not whose parent made the most sacrifices to get them there.", "NTA\n\nMother is being an asshole here. Credit stealing is so gross.

Graduation acknowledges your success, and before reading this, I've never heard of parents walking with their kids.", "Narc mother alert! Your graduation is about you. It's your parent's job to sit in the audience beaming with pride. NTA. I doubt the school would even allow this nonsense.", "NTA. Sounds weird, entitled & trying to take away from your day. Just MO.", "NTA\n\nDoes your mom try to make things about herself in general? Is it possible she's feeling lost because (if you are her youngest) she's about to see her baby go off to college?

The only time a family member walks in the ceremony in our district is when we have a special needs graduate who is best supported by their own family member.  (We provide an aide, but a few students are just best served by a family member).  Those family members wear a black gown (not our school color) and are clearly there to provide support.

You did right not to let her walk with you.", "Your mom is an attention seeking A. You are NTA", "NTA\n\nYou don't want her too, she doesn't. Simple as that. Your mother decides how much of a fight that is. If she wants to be recognised, maybe take her out to lunch as a thank you or do something (I still think expecting this is too much and takes away from its authenticity but it's something) but that's as far as it needs to go.", "NTA.

My son just graduated and I cannot imagine asking to walk with him for HIS accomplishment and HIS graduation. That is ridiculously absurd.

I find it bizarre that she is so hung up on this when she has had three of her own graduations. Sure she supported you, but that's to be expected. That's not something that merits special recognition. Kind of seems like she's just jealous of the \"specialness\" of your friend's gesture for his mom. (I am a mom, by the way.)", "NTA I graduated last year and my parents were fully invested in watching me walk the stage. They would\u2019ve never requested anything like that, we graduate high school once and it\u2019s our moment", "NTA - your mother will also want to wear a white wedding dress to your wedding because she raised you and made you the man you are.

NTA. \n\nShe\u2019s making this moment about her. \n\nHigh school graduation ceremonies are for the kids.  It marks the end of one stage of life and the beginning of adulthood.

From that point on we are more guides than parents. \n\nSaying no to mom is okay, it\u2019s a healthy boundary to set.
