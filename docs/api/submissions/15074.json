Why? Because you knew they weren't really a friend, they were just trying to manipulate you. Manipulative people are AHs.  \n\nIt just goes to the part where OP agreed to respect the girls wishes and just be friends. then he invites her to a concert and gets mad when he realizes they are actually going as friends. Wasn't that what he promised he'd respect and agreed to? He was being manipulative. \n\nHe accused her of using him, but he was the one who was actually trying to manipulate her.\n\nOP should be spending that kind of money on people who have already agreed to date him, not people who have rejected him. It's his choice if he wants to throw his money away. He must assume accountability.", "That's very presumptuous, he actually sounds as if he's too nice and is a bit naive. Not exactly a raging hard on type. At the least he's not a \"guaranteed\" misogynist as you're painting him to be.", "if she'd done something, OP would have said so\n\nbecause it would have helped his case and been relevant to the story\n\nand as it turns out, if you read his comments, he pestered the crap out of her and tried over and over. she never reciprocated and he kept trying and eventually he forced a conversation and that's when she demurred about the headspace\n\nand then he supposedly respected her decision but not really because he kept at her\n\npeople don't say \"I will never date you\" because it's rude as hell, considered an asshole move, and RISKY\n\nif she said that everyone here would call her an AH without really extreme circumstances warranting it, and she doesn't need to take additional risk because it might theoretically get through to a guy who isn't fucking listening to her anyway\n\nshe said no. the answer was no and at that point dating is off the table, probably forever, but definitely the only thing putting it back on the table would be her bringing it up\n\nyou don't treat her differently on the assumption that she will change her mind. the answer is no. no is no is no", "He asked her to hang out after being told she wasn\u2019t interested, lol", "If I open my wallet and give all of my money to random people on the street, then cry about all of my money being gone?\n\nThat's not naive. That's downright silly.\n\nIf you want to give your money away, that's fine. That's your choice. But no one asked for your money, you offered it. Be accountable for your choices.", "How was he taken advantage of exactly? He asked someone to go to a concert with him and she accepted. Did she put a gun to his head and make him ask her out?

It does make her a bit of one though. \n\nNot a super fair analogy, guy said he gave her space cause she said she wasn't ready for a relationship at that time. Guy tries again by asking out to a concert, she says yes (but has a bf). Lots of comments saying it's 'code' for not being interested -at all- , probably true, but also a terrible way to try to tell someone you're not interested in them.", "Id be too guilty to accept it if i was in her shoes.", "Id also say \"sorry I'm just not interested in you that way\"", "But hey expensive concert tickets", "eh we don't really know the terms/wording of how he asked her.\n\nWe don't even know if she knew how expensive the tickets were or if she knew he thought it was a date. OP said they've been friends for years.  She seems pretty open about not wanting to date OP and open about her new relationship status. \n\nOP knows exactly where he stands. She's not leading him on at all.  He was being delusional and ignoring all the signs and making unreasonable decisions and he needs to learn to be accountable and to stop doing that.  Again, he spent a thousand dollars! You can't defend that.", "We don't know but you've picked a side based on more assumptions, compared to the information we've been provided. I'm just working with what's provided in the original post. \n\nHe said used to be friends of friends for years. The only info we have is one 'now isn't a good time' rejection. \n\nAnyway, I guess in the end he was just asking r/AITA if he'd be the asshole for cancelling. Based on everything he said and what I've said I personally don't think he's an asshole at all and should defs just cancel and be honest with her and also polite. Simple.\n\nEdit: hmm.. I still think she kinda knew what she was doing but it all depends on how long she was already seeing this new dude before changing fb status. Too many variables honestly. But I'm not super hard stance on 'she used him'... maybe though. Depends how solid their 'friendship'  actually is", "If she truly wanted to manipulate him, it would have been easy to hide the relationship status until after the expensive concert. \n\n\nOP knew the entire time that he wasn't dating this girl. Despite that, he decided to spend $1000 on concert tickets for her. He has no one to blame but himself.\n\nif I say \"hey Rude-Lettuce-8982 do you want to date me?\" and you say \"No\" then I say \"ok well, I still want to be friends. I have a $100 that I want you to have just as friends!\"  and you say \"oh thanks!\"  then I find out you have a girlfriend so I'm like \"hey give me that $100 bucks back, I thought you were single!\".... that's an AH move.  I wouldn't think you took advantage of me, i'd think I was a ridiculous person with delusional behavior.", "Like I said he's naive because she said that in not so many words according to OP. She said she wasn't interested in dating right now, he still thought he had a chance. 1K on tickets for a first date is crazy tho. But if he had the money it's his right to be crazy. \n\nHe even said no ill feelings he just wanted to know if he's an AH for cancelling. I don't think he is.", "She doesnt want to be in a relationship with you, or date you, and you still dont understand it. You werent used for a concert, you were never going together as a date.

You then invited her to a concert and thought of it as a romantic date, but you never bothered to specify that you are asking her out, so she OF COURSE thought you are going on the date solely as friends - which is what friends do. And now, when you found out she is in a relationship, you want to cancel the date - because you know she's going there as a friend.\n\nYou two aren't friends. Friends have each other's backs and care for each other. The only reason you are still \"friendly\" with her is that you hope she will change her mind and turn into your love interest. Please, let this girl go already.", "If she was not aware that you classified it as a date then YTA. If was aware that it was a date with romantic intentions then NTA. However, it seems she sees you as a friend from what I see according to your post and probably assumed this was a friendly invite.", "YTA In what possible universe would you NOT be the asshole? 500 Days of Summer was a warning about this kind of thinking, not a how-to guide", "Info: did you pay for her ticket or she paid herself?", "YTA this was not a date. You can\u2019t trick someone into going on a date with you. She\u2019s not \u201cusing\u201d you for a concert, you INVITED her to one.

You lied to her and told her you respected her when she rejected you, then pretended to still be her friend. She said yes to going to a concert with her \u201cfriend\u201d. You didn\u2019t say it was a date when you asked her, after she\u2019s already said no to dating you, so in her mind it\u2019s as friends. Nothing is a date unless both people know and have agreed that it\u2019s a date. If you had asked her to go to the concert AS a date and used those words, chances are she would\u2019ve said no\u2026 again. Learn to respect no. She does not owe you anything, you are not entitled to date her. \n\nBut honestly you shouldn\u2019t take her to the concert at all, you should leave this girl alone and stop pretending to be her friend. Stop pretending to be her friend and using her in hopes that you can eventually convince her to date you. \n\nEven if she wasn\u2019t crystal clear to you with her wording of not being in the right headspace, that answer still necessitates a direct conversation about whether an invitation to something is a date.", "Info.

That IS pushing. \n\nThis entire posts reads like you are butthurt because she chose to date someone that isn\u2019t you.

Because a grown woman telling him repeatedly she isn't interested isn't enough, but he'll respect another man's claim of ownership....", "It depends, if the guy has been perusing her over and over despite her saying no, saying she isn't looking or ready right now usually gets a better response and the guy tends to leave the girl alone.
