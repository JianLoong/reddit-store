For those reasons, women usually do soft rejections. They say things like I am very busy at the moment or I am not interested in dating right now rather than saying I don't want to date you. The thing to understand is that if she is genuinely busy, she will try to suggest an alternative get together.

It means she liked the other guy even more than the bad breakup messed her up.  \n\n> Do I think she had malicious intents, no. \n\nWell now you're lying.  You said in the post that you felt used.   \n\nYou're backtracking to not look like a NG.", "Can you genuinely not tell what you did wrong or why this is an asshole move?\n\nDid she ask you to buy those things or spend that money on her? \n\nDoes she owe you something, because you chose,  _of your own free will_ to spend that money?\n Even though she directly told you she did not want to date, nor was she even considering doing so at the time?\n\nFinal question, did you make it explicitly clear to her that going to the concert would be a romantic date and not a platonic hang out?", "Here\u2019s a tip for you: no means no. No doesn\u2019t mean try again in two weeks. No doesn\u2019t mean spend a thousand dollars on someone to guilt them into sex. No means no. \n\nIf you can\u2019t get over her and be her friend, leave this poor girl alone.", "Nice guy syndrome.", "YTA. She told you repeatedly she didn't want to \"date\" you, so you figured you'd impress her by spending lots of money on concert tickets so that YOU could pretend it was a \"date\".", "> my last shot I took at it was basically saying I didn\u2019t want to push but that I liked her \n\n***Last shot***\n\nSo you admit the concert wasn't a date and you're canceling it out of spite?", "Except he would still be just a friend.  It takes two people to agree for it to be more.  She turned him down.  \n\nIt doesn't matter if he expressed interest if she said no.  He's still just a friend.  \n\nIf you really think wanting to be more than friends makes you on a special level above just friends, then you need to go out into the real world a while.", "\u201cThis woman has told me for months she\u2019s not interested in dating me. I figured I would trick her into a date by offering tickets to a fun concert, then she has the audacity to go and date someone else! Now *I* feel tricked! That wasn\u2019t supposed to happen! :(\u201c \u2014 OP", "He 100% seems like a stalker to me.\n\nThis entire account is one sided and extremely unreasonable.", "I knew a guy like that when I was like 17/18, he bought me tons of stuff to basically try to bribe me into dating him, even though I, both of his cousins that were actually my friends, and several of his friends frequently and frankly told him that I was absolutely not interested in him, he's way too old for me, I didn't actually like him as a person, and I only tolerated his presence because of how much I adore his cousins. \n\nHe was SURE that the next expensive costume piece or dress was going to be THE ONE that changed my mind and won me over.  \n\nNope. He moved on after a few years, I think I got too old for him to be interested. 20 years later, I'm still friends with both of his cousins, so I know he's still single and creepy, and still fixating on a new legal but too young for him, ginger every few years. \n\nWhy are sides like this?", "I\u2019m pretty sure if we had the other side of this story, we would be even more flabbergasted.\n\nBut op admitting to spending $1000 unprompted was the only hint we needed that he\u2019s perhaps a bit unhinged.", "It\u2019s delusional and manipulative.\n\nThe sheer amount he spent makes me question his mental health, honestly. This is honestly a bad situation.", "And some reasons make a person an asshole.", "And she already told him many times before that she didn\u2019t want to date him, only to be friends. She (naively) thought that men listen when you tell them that and agreed to go to a concert with him. He is the asshole for trying to make a move after she has repeatedly told him no.", "She didn\u2019t ask him to buy anything. \n\nHe invited her, while understanding the terms of their relationship. That\u2019s on him.  There\u2019s nothing to even suggest she knew how much the tickets cost. She just agreed to his invitation.\n\nIt\u2019s a mess entirely of his making.\n\nI\u2019d agree with you if she asked him to get the concert tickets. But she didn\u2019t even do that.", "She repeatedly told him that she just wanted to be friends (by OPs own accounts). He then made the decision to buy concert tickets for her (something that I have done for friends though they were closer to $100) and then got salty when turns out she was in fact not in love with him (as she has stated several times before). \n\nAs a woman who has been in this situation many times, if he hasn\u2019t started harassing her yet, he will.", "Yes.  She needs to know that he's such a creep.", "No means no, not try harder.", "Nope.  I have never gone to a concert with friends that we didn't pay for our own tickets.", "Ok but either way, he's not TA for not taking her to the concert.", "Trying to take a girl who said no to him to a concert under false pretences is definitely creepy. And it IS under false pretences. If it\u2019s not, it wouldn\u2019t matter she had a bf or no. They would be going as friends.", "Exactly lol. I\u2019ve been to exactly one concert with a partner, every other one was with friends (and we were standing together and got dinner before)", "Seriously.  I've gone with several guys and girls on outings like this.  Wasn't dating a single one of them.  \n\nWe were friends acting like friends do.  If one had told me we were dating because they tricked me into an outing, I'd cut them off.", "I mean, in this case I don't disagree he pushed it too far, but I met a girl who had just broken up from a long term relationship and she told me she wasn't looking for anything right now. A few months later she messaged me back to ask to hang out. That was almost 10 years ago, been together ever since. We've been married for 5+ years with 2 kids and life couldn't be better. \n\nWe can't tell him to on one hand listen to what she says and back off, and on the other hand tell him to ignore what she is saying because it means something else.", "I didn\u2019t say he was smart. I said he wasn\u2019t a friend. Obviously he can\u2019t just be that", "Lol that last paragraph\u2026just wow lol. \n\nI think they will never be platonic friends because OP doesn\u2019t know how to be just a friend. That\u2019s more than obvious based on his story, no?", "A couple times I would tell guys I had a boyfriend, because I did, and they would say \u201cI don\u2019t believe you!\u201d Ok buddy, so either I do have a boyfriend or I\u2019m lying in order to not talk to you anymore \u2014 your pick.", "I can absolutely picture this guy trying to get snuggly at the concert and/or making advances in the car after (especially if they decide to hang out in the parking lot and wait for the traffic to subside) and then throwing a tantrum and bringing up the cost of the tickets when she inevitably rebuffs him, and reminds him she's not interested and thought they were going as friends.", "This. Just this.", "He need a therapist not a gym membership. Don\u2019t convince crappy guys that they need to be hotter. They need to be better.", "No, based on his comment history, he was borderline harassing this girl. He doesn\u2019t need to get hotter, he needs to go to one of the first year uni seminars about consent.", "Wild. First concert I ever went to was with my childhood best friend and she paid. Second time, I paid. The only concert I\u2019ve been to with a partner we each paid our own ticket. \n\nJust because someone pays for your tickets (or drinks or food or anything) doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a date. Unless you are with a prostitute, money doesn\u2019t buy sex (or romance).", "Well he\u2019s the asshole for trying to buy the tickets to guilt her into dating him. He\u2019s also the asshole for only taking her no\u2019s seriously when there is another guy in the picture. Essentially, he is the asshole for harassing her.", "Nice job admitting that you also harass women.", "If he\u2019s made his intentions clear repeatedly, but she still agreed to go to a concert that she had to have known would be super expensive (based on whoever it is they\u2019re seeing), then she would have known he was asking her as a date and If she agreed to go, while dating someone else, then she did take advantage of him for a free concert. He\u2019s asked her our repeatedly and she would shut him down. She knew this wasn\u2019t 2 friends hanging out.", "She has made it clear that she isn't interested in him at least right now. He is being a pushy asshole who asks multiple times after getting an answer that he didn't like. \n\nIf she was interested in a few months, SHE will show interest in a few months. That doesn't mean pester her until she says yes.", "But in your situation, it did mean she didn't want to date you, it didn't mean anything else. She changed her mind later, I'm guessing partly because you respected her no and didn't push, but it doesn't change the fact that the initial \"I'm not looking for anything right now\" meant \"no, I don't want to date you\". The no always means no, and people can change their mind later, but pushing past the no is a very good way to turn a conditional no into a permanent no. Doesn't change that the no should always be taken at face value until it freely and without pressure becomes a yes", "Yeah but you respected her space.  \n\nThis girl OP has been talking to for the entirety of a month, he asked multiple times, and claimed after he *\"last shot\"* he kept dropping hints and \"light nods\".  \n\nHe did need to back off on the hints.  He didn't.  He shot himself in the foot.  \n\nYou backed off and she messaged you.  You showed respect.  \n\nWhether or not she means the line to gently say no or really isn't in a good headspace doesn't matter.  The response is the same - back off.  Either she decides to pursue it or not later on.", "You\u2019re really digging your heels in, aren\u2019t you?", "That\u2019s kind of how this place works.  The OP paints themselves in the best possible picture and we judge filling in the missing details.  Personally if he didn\u2019t say I thought she had changed her mind because she was flirting with me all the time then that probably didn\u2019t happen.\n\nIf the OP believed he hadn\u2019t been friend zoned and his goal wasn\u2019t to change her mind then it would be stated here.\n\nLet\u2019s look at this situation from the women\u2019s point of view\n\n- she told this person she didn\u2019t want to date him\n- she accepted going to a concert with her friend\n- she started dating someone else.\n\nWhere is the issue with what she did here?", "Would being more direct be better?  Sure. Would it have changed the situation at all?  Probably not.\n\nIf the OP was neurodivergent then I would be more understanding to him missing the cues. \n\nNo does not mean try harder.\n\nNot in the head space to date does not mean spend $1000 on me.  Even if he was just hanging around friend zoned waiting investing $1000 on that chance is foolish and certainly is smart.\n\nWhat did the women do in this situation\n\n- she said she didn\u2019t want to date him\n- she accepted concert tickets as a friend\n- she decided to go out with someone else\n\nIn what world did she do anything wrong?", "Honestly not as bad as I expected.", "Lol, that\u2019s some strong projection there.\n\nLots of women like to play the \u201clet\u2019s see if he\u2019ll actually pursue me\u201d game. \n\nGiving a girl some time and then revisiting the conversation at a later date is not harassment\u2026.but it\u2019s now reached the point that OP needs to move on.", "Yes, I said he pushed it too far, he was a pushy creepy dude. Did I say he should keep pestering her? No. When my wife told me the same thing  l told her if things change for her reach out back to me if she wanted to, and didn't talk to her again until she did. \n\nAll I'm advocating for is actually listening to what a woman says and not trying to say \"if she tells you one thing it really means another\". Listen to what people tell you and act accordingly.", "I never said her no meant anything but no. \n\nListen to what people say, believe them, and act accordingly.", "I have only dated one guy after he repeated showed interest because I had got myself into a situation where I felt unsafe saying no. I have had to cut many friendships because of men like you.", "I disagree that it wasn\u2019t clear.\n\nI think OP left the dating conversation with the girl clearly understanding they are not dating right now.\n\nBut yeah - peoples lives are crazy! Have a good one!", "Here\u2019s a secret:  those dudes were never interested in just being friends.  \n\nSounds like you just wanted to use them. \n\nDon\u2019t try to act like they\u2019re the bad guys when you probably strung them along.", "You\u2019re probably right, they were never interested in being my friend. I was friends with the one for 5 years and when I became single (after a long term relationship) he made a move. I politely declined. Then made another move a month later and then every other week until I cut off the friendship. \n\nAnother was my friend for a year and then made a move when I became single. He\u2019s the one I ended up dating for a bit because I felt unsafe saying no. \n\nAnother, admittedly made his intentions clear after about 3 months of friendship at which point I declined. He only actually tried a couple more times and we ended up being friends after that. \n\nThere was another one that I was trapped with (working in a remote community) and I declined about 5 times and then he sexually assaulted me. \n\nI could keep going on. For about the past 3 years, I have never let a man pay for anything for me because so many of these guys would throw what they spent on me during our friendships in my face (never mind that I also paid for stuff for them). Even in committed relationships we split bills or it\u2019s every other. I\u2019m done being pressured into sex because someone bought me beers on a couple occasions.", "If you read OPs comments, the girl was abundantly clear. He is refusing to take no for an answer."]}
