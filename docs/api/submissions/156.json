Maybe he should be with his cousin if his opinion is so precious. Sounds like a dude who only respects the opinions of other men.", "NTA this is a bit of immaturity mixed in with a dose of sexism.  I wonder how he treats women at work? I\u2019ve had this happen - I suggest something or come up with a solution, have it dismissed only to have a male colleague come up with the exact same thing and then get praise for it.  It\u2019s incredibly frustrating and demeaning - why would you want to live with someone who does this all the time?", "NTA\n\nI'd bring up these same examples to him and see what he says. If nothing else you're shining a light on a serious communication problem in your relationship. His response to this may help you decide if being in this relationship is worth it.", "Sit down and talk. If he can\u2019t see it or acknowledge it \nYou have to ask yourself if you are willing to be an unheard partner in this relationship", "NTA. That sounds pretty demeaning. Talk to him about how dismissive he is with you. If it doesn't change or he doesn't think it's important to take seriously, this relationship needs therapy.", "NTA. You feel like you feel. But if your boyfriend doesn't place value in your opinions, he's not going to change. YOu have to decide if this is a deal breaker for you. It's been 5 years. This is how he is.\n\nFrom personal experience, I'd say, cut your losses and move on. But, you can decide if it's okay with you.", "Nta, it wudnt be wrong of u to do that and u shud definetly voice ur concerns in a non-threatening way though I have a feeling he will turn this into an argument and get defensive over it\u2026just make sure u word it right and hopefully it will go smoothly", "NTA My dad used to do this all the time. If it was a suggestion brought up by my mom, siblings, or me, he'd dismiss it in one way or another, but if a friend suggested the same thing, then he'd be all for it and act like we never said anything. You should definitely have a discussion with him. If he dismisses it, then I'd say that's five years down the drain and don't waste anymore on someone who doesn't care about your feelings or ideas.", "NTA- but it sounds like you need to talk with the cousin. Bf just blows you off until the cousin says something anyway\u2026 maybe if cousin makes him realize what he\u2019s doing, he\u2019ll start being better for you. /s\n\nEdit: meant to add /s originally as I don\u2019t think she should actually talk to the cousin\u2026 just that the bf will dismiss her the way he already does.", "NAH lots of people need time or multiple inputs before they can accept recommendations like this. Tell him about your feelings, he's your partner, but don't expect change.  \nMy spouse is like this often, I just leave it. I make recommendations and it's up to them what they do. Sometimes they follow them. \nOne of my siblings will sometimes recommend things and I'll come up with reasons in the moment why I don't want to follow it but then x months later they'll notice I followed it or I'll tell them. They know that things like that need time to get comfy in my brain before I act on them and don't take my initial dismissal to heart. We both know this is a thing.  \nI guess what I'm saying is, enjoy being right but try not to be salty.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

We've gone 5 times.\n\nIn my experience you can communicate your feelings, but odds are they are going to take someone esle's advice/recommendation over your own (maybe because you're too close to the situation, I dont' know).
