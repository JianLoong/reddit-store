You're not a local restaurant, you're a person hosting a party that is taking full responsibility to prepare a meal for 25 people. I would use this opportunity to propose a more potluck style approach instead of one person taking the full burden to either appease or not appease the group. That way the vegan can bring a tofu dish and the vegetarian can bring their specific meal and the gluten-intolerant can bring special GF pasta or whatever.

For example I used to have a jew coworker who I didn't eat pork in front of him.  Same with a lady I dated who was from Saudi Arabia I didn't eat pork in front of her either.  Why did I do that?

Prepare a dish that meets all requirements (vegan and gluten free - basically just make a bean/vegetable dish), a \u201cclean\u201d salad on the side that people can dress themselves as they wish, and prepare a meat side dish for those who want it, and a basket of bread rolls.

At last count I had 2 who were vegan, 2 diabetics,  1 gluten free (non-celiac) and 2 with lactose intolerance (no overlapping conditions).\n\nI make 2 entrees/proteins (1 vegan, 1 non) and all my sides are vegan friendly except mashed/scalloped potatoes.   Since the gluten free is a choice I don't have to worry about contamination causing a problem, I just cook things that can be easily swapped around.  Roast meat of some kind is always safe.  If you're trying to do it on the cheap, beyond meat makes an amazing lasagna/spaghetti sauce and is vegan friendly.  Make a gluten free pasta and a spaghetti squash and everyone is covered.\n\nIt's only hard if you make it hard or if your guests surprise you with their conditions last minute.", "I\u2019m a picky eater and I always bring something that I can have, I never expect someone to make something specific to me.  Why don\u2019t you trade houses each event but turn the event into a potluck?", "YTA- \n\nFamily style meals like a taco night are stupid easy to accommodate for vegan/vegetarian eaters.

People don\u2019t usually make these kind to changes to their diet because it\u2019s a fad. It\u2019s usually because for some inexplicable reason, certain food started to impact them in a negative way. Not all food sensitivities are symptoms of a medical issue. If you didn\u2019t want to cater to the needs of all of your guests, you shouldn\u2019t have agreed to host. \n\nSince the family is so large, it might be time to turn these dinners into potlucks that you all take turns organizing and hosting. That way the cooking duties are evenly divided and the hosts only have to worry about the dish they provide and cleaning up before and after the gathering.", "YTA. For one, \"glucose\" is sugar, and has nothing to do with celiac disease. Secondly, people might have health reasons to change their diet, like blood pressure or digestion issues. Don't host if you're not going to be a good host. Also, it's so easy to make just one meal for everyone if you don't want to make multiple.

Pot luck. Everyone brings a dish. The person hosting is responsible for drinks, a dish, and cleanup. \n\nI grew up in a big family with weekly dinners. No one expect one person (hosting) to do all the cooking.

But don't blame it on the vegan and vegetarian (also why would you make two separate lasagnes here, you're not really doing this in the most streamlined way possible), you just don't want to put in the effort to feed everyone you're inviting. That's fine but it's not their fault.", "I'm truly curious if you go the vegans house if you expect them to make you a dish that contains animal/meat or animal/meat products to accommodate your diet...or they should just cook for their dietary requirements?  Would a salad with chicken work for you?   Surely it would be a lot of work for them, and money spent of products they'll never use again just to cook you a meal that contains animals/meat and animal/meat products.

There's no rule that you have to host parties at your house. It's also fine to not want to cook multiple meals. It's fine to choose who you invite to your house. \n\nBut if you choose to host, and if you choose to invite people with dietary restrictions, you have to prepare food for them.", "YTA\n\nSolely based on how you framed this, it's safe to assume that if the roles were reversed; you'd be the one pissed off. It's not that difficult to accommodate 3 people. As other commentators have said, you can find one dish to make that satisfies all conditions. You're just looking for validation to be a shitty host.", "YTA, that\u2019s rude. Making a vegan and gluten-free option isn\u2019t hard, it\u2019s a standard request. I made vegan (which vegetarians can also eat) and meat option lasagna for 30 people 2 weeks ago. It just involves leaving our meat and cheese from one and substituting something else. I bet you don\u2019t cook often if you think it\u2019s hard. \n\nNow, if one person had severe allergies to a bunch of stuff, then sure, they should bring their own food - but you would have to let them know ahead of time.", "I think having a nice big salad with the option of grilled chicken in addition to the meal is pretty good.

It's very hard to cater to a group that large. if 4 of the 26 are an issue, then those four need to figure themselves out. He's in the right, that's a lot of work and lot of issues to keep track of, def when vegans are involved. Allergies are different, vegans don't fall into that.

The thing is though, if you're going to host a meal, I think it's fine to do your chicken and salad but it wouldn't kill you to make a vegan/gluten free (or glucose free) option as well. It's not that difficult to go on the internet and find a recipe to follow but if you don't want to, then you don't want to.
