{"id": 27491, "submission_id": "16qcanq", "title": "AITA for telling my son he shouldn't have given away my granddaughter's gift?", "selftext": "Usual disclaimers apply; sorry this is long.    \n    \nI (49M) will be the first to admit I'm not a perfect father, but I've tried my hardest to do right by my son (23M); it's just been the two of us since he was very young, and I've always tried to instill in him the value of hard work and making the best of yourself. So I was incredibly proud when he got a place at a prestigious university (Russell Group) to study aerospace engineering.    \n    \nAt uni, he met \"Susie\" (now 24F), who had a daughter (3 at the time, now 8), \"Bonnie\". Her having a kid so young, with the father out of the picture, raised a lot of red flags for me even after meeting her, so I was honest with my son; she was clearly looking for a dad for her kid first-and-foremost, and he'd be putting his future at risk by taking that role. He told me he wanted to step up and help raise this girl anyway, because he loved her and he loved Susie, and wouldn't hear anything to the contrary.   \n    \nWell, long story short, he dropped out after one year of uni with something like \u00a314,000 in student debt (last I checked, but that was a few years ago) and moved in with Susie, and is now working a dead-end data entry job while playing daddy to someone else's kid. We still talk occasionally, but things have become tense between us; he's noticed I don't have any interest or affection for his partner or Bonnie, and we've fought on-and-off over it a few times.    \n    \nWhich brings me to two months ago, when my son called me to let me know that I had a grandkid. Apparently, he and Susie decided not to tell anyone except people who had to know and close family (which really means her family, apparently) until the kid was born. I'll admit, that hurt a lot, but I swallowed my pride and sent them a card along with a couple of books; one a baby book and the other a nice edition of a storybook I hoped my granddaughter would get to enjoy once she was older.    \n    \nA few days later, they made a Facebook post to announce the kid publically, and in one of the photos, Bonnie had the second book I'd sent. I messaged my son asking why he'd given something that was meant to be my grandkid's special thing to Susie's kid instead, and he told me that Bonnie's noticed I don't send her things for birthdays etc, that she felt out when her sister got gifts and she didn't, and that it's one of her favourite books. He said his other daughter is too young to know it was meant for her; I said that Bonnie isn't even his daughter, and he needs to accept that I don't owe anything to someone else's kid. It turned into this huge fight and I got a long message, signed by both him and Susie, saying I wasn't going to have any more contact with my granddaughter until I accept Susie and Bonnie are family too.    \n    \nI've complained about all this to my work friends, and gotten mixed reactions. Some say I'm in the right, but I've also been told by more than a few that I'm an AH for \"rejecting\" this kid.

It would have been so, so easy for you to just send the card and books and to say the photos were cute but no, you had to make it clear that you didn't care about sending the new baby a gift anywhere near as much as you cared about wanting to make an 8 yr old feel like a second class citizen in her own home with her own family.\n\nYou're putting your right to dislike and exclude your sons wife and daughter over your love for your son and your new grandchild....and that's totally your choice BUT you cannot expect your son to be ok with this and honestly, if he was, that would make him a bad person, a bad husband and a bad father. You should be proud that your son is protecting his family, and ashamed that you are the hurtful influence he has to protect them from.\n\nAlso, just assuming your son WAS ok with you icing out half of his family, what were you expecting would happen? That your granddaughter would grow up with fond memories of how you totally ignored her sister and mother?", "Lol YTA. This can't be real. Nobody thinks that children's books in a household can be read only by the one child. A baby can't even appreciate stories in any real way, what is it OP expects here? For the parents to hide a kids book up on top of a shelf or in a closet cuz its for baby's eyes only? What an absurdity.", "YTA, massively so.  Your son isn\u2019t \u2018playing daddy\u2019, he has more of an understanding of fatherhood than you will ever have.   You clearly do not value love and affection, your son does.   I wish your son and his family all the best.", "yeah, YTA.  Your post is dripping with contempt for Susie, who is the person your son loves and has chosen to spend his life with.  Even more concerning is your contempt for Bonnie, who is just a child wondering why her step Grandpa hates her.\n\nYou also don't get to chose what your kids do for a living, dead end job or not.  This is not to say you can't be privately frustrated.  I'm sure my mother still wishes I was a doctor.  She has the good sense not to say it out loud.\n\nThe reason you didn't find out about the baby is because your son and his wife chose sensibly to go low contact with you.  If you'd like it not to be no contact, I suggest you offer them both a heartfelt apology and start acting like a grandfather.", "YTA. When I married my wife three years ago, she already had a three-year-old son. I was slightly concerned about how my parents would treat Jack, but they instantly took the role of grandparents.\n\nMy wife recently became pregnant and when we decided to tell our parents, my wife was concerned about how my parents would view the two children. \n\nWhen we told my parents, I said that now they would have a \u201creal\u201c grandchild. My father looked at me as if I was daft and said we  already have a \u201creal\u201d grandchild, and that I needed to adopt him.\n\nOnce they left, my wife and I had a good cry.  \n\nOP is AH.", ">I've tried my hardest to do right by my son\n\nNo, you haven't.\n\nYou've demonstrated outright contempt for Susie and Bonnie, whom he loves. You've demonstrated quite a bit of contempt for your son, too, saying he's \"playing daddy to someone else's kid\" and \"working a dead-end data entry job.\"\n\nYou even had to \"swallow your pride\" to simply send a card and a small gift after the birth of your new granddaughter.\n\nYou ought to be thrilled that he has a partner and two children whom he loves dearly.\n\nYou ought to be ashamed at how little love you're demonstrating for him. YTA 1,000 times over.", "YTA.\n\nFirst off you sounds really judgemental. From what you wrote I get the impression that you blame Susie for your son not finishing college. I'm pretty sure you spent a lot of time boasting that your son was studying at the Russel Group.\n\nBecause of that you have ruined the relationship with your son and his partner. I'm sure you take every opportunity to remind your son that he dropped out of college and has student debt. You sound like that sort of an AH.\n\nI get that you hate Susie and her child so much that you want nothing to do with them. That much was apparent. I'm sure it's apparent to your son and Susie.\n\nThen you have the cheek to think that they should let you know they are having a child. That's for family, well have you actually treated them like family?\n\nThen you think they should respect the gifts you give for your granddaughter? You are lucky they didn't just throw them in the rubbish.", "YTA. My mother was like you. My brother married a woman 9 years his senior who had a child from her first marriage. My mom hated her and the kid. In her eyes they ruined her baby boy's life.\n\nExcept my brother's life isn't ruined. He is deliriously happy with his wife and they went on to have more kids. It's just not the life my mother planned for him. And that's OK. Because it's his life. He gets to ultimately choose what it looks like. \n\nShe got over it. They are close now and she watches their kids every day after school.\n\nYou need to decide what is important here. Having a relationship with your son and his family, or dying alone and mad because he had his own plan for his life.", "Wow. YTA. \n\nDid you actually read what you wrote? It drips with condescension and narcissism. \n\nThis isn\u2019t about YOU. This is about a small human who will wonder why her step-grandfather (and yes, you ARE THAT) treats her like crap. \n\nShame on you. No wonder your kid doesn\u2019t like you. Seems there is not much to like.", "YTA \nIt\u2018s quite amusing that you felt entiteled to the information about the addition to your sons family, while openly showing how you disapproved his family for years. Your son sees Bonnie as his daughter, it doesn\u2018t matter how you feel about it. You felt hurt by not beeing included regarding the pregnancy announcement. Imagine how hurt your son must have felt all these years not accepting his family.", "Definitely YTA. This is your son's chosen family. He decided to be a exceptionally good man and be a father to a little girl that didn't have one. That makes him pretty goddamned amazing in my book, especially considering all the step family horror stories we see here on Reddit. Big damn deal that he didn't fuck Susie and make Bonnie. Why should that matter? If you're disappointed he didn't \"live up to his potential\" when he dropped out and took a \"dead end job\", that's YOUR problem. If he's happy with his life then that's all that matters. But at the bottom of all this is a child who just wants to be loved. What kind of asshole can't love an innocent child? I'm a self proclaimed giant bitch and an asshole and I still adore every single one of my seven grandchildren, only three of which are actually blood related. I don't care. Those babies (15 - 7 yo) are MINE dammit and I love the hell out of them. \n\nDon't take your anger and disappointment with your son out on innocent children, you asshole.", "YTA, you seem super and strangely jealous of Susie and Bonnie. It\u2019s bizarre. What did they ever do to make you hate them so much, especially a little girl?", "YTA it\u2019s the username. It\u2019s laughable when you\u2019re not even loving or a grandpa anymore. You\u2019re officially a stranger to both of them now. Good luck being alone.", "Are you serious? YTA. Playing daddy to someone else\u2019s kid? Yikes, what is wrong with you man? For all intents and purposes that\u2019s his kid now. No wonder they didn\u2019t tell you anything. You gave a gift that the baby can\u2019t use for years and you are upset it\u2019s not sitting there collecting dust. Gtfoh", "YTA\n\nNews flash, now you no longer have a son or granddaughter. \n\nWhatever you think of your son, he fell in love and stepped up to be a father. You mention that Suzi was looking for a father. No kidding, she knew if she got into a relationship, that person would also have to accept her daughter.", "INFO: Did he drop out of university because you cut off all financial support and said he would only get it back if he dumped Susie?\n\nI mean YTA regardless. I\u2019m just curious how much of an AH you are.", "YTA. Accept your DIL already. It\u2019s not your place to control who your son loves & his future is his and his alone, you have no say. Bonnie did nothing to you & it wouldn\u2019t kill you to be nice to her, even grandfatherly considering she is the older sister of your grandchild, not to mention someone your son considers to be his daughter. Get over yourself already.", "YTA. You're going to be complaining very soon about how your son never visits or calls and won't let you see your granddaughter. And it'll be all your fault, asshole.", "You know, I carry a lot of shame over how long it took me to understand that my children get to make their own choices, and be happy, even if its not what I thought best or had dreamed for them. I lost a lot of time thinking like you do, before I apologized and let them live their lives. It took a long time for them to trust me again.  I will never get that time back. YTA but there is still time!", "YTA, dude. If Bonnie was an older kid, or didn't want your son to be her dad, or had another parent in the picture, then maybe I'd think differently. But your son has been in her life since she was *three*, and it's clear that he sees her as his own daughter and vice-versa. Strictly speaking, no, you don't \"owe\" her anything, but you're punishing her, her mum, and your son just because her *father* deviated from the life path you predetermined for him.    \n    \nThey're happy; why can't you be happy for them? I can see why Susie and your son didn't tell you they were having a kid.    \n    \nEDIT: reading his replies, OP seems to be racist. Big surprise :/", "YTA\n\nIf you want to lose your son, this is how you lose your son", "You don\u2019t get to chose his partner. That\u2019s a fact of life. Whether you like her or not, you are responsible for driving this wedge between you. It\u2019s your responsibility to fix it. \nI desperately understand your position, so don\u2019t take this lightly when I say YTA. Stop spiting Bonnie, she doesn\u2019t know any different. It\u2019s very sad they gave the book you intended for your first grandchild away, you have a step grandchild too. You\u2019re going to have to accept it or your relationship with your son is doomed.", "INFO: Who were you expecting him to end up with? Why is it so important to be with someone you specifically expected?\n\nEdit: yall, I see thru his shit too. He's a racist, narcissist. I'm just curious how his mind works", "YTA \n\nWow. Way to make sure that if they have another kid you won't even hear about it.", "YTA. You have to accept that your son is a grown-up and can live his life in whatever way he chooses as long as it doesn't hurt anyone. Evidently, he has chosen Suzy and Bonnie to be his family - confirmed by the new baby. And no, his choice has not hurt you. If you want your son and bio grandkid in your life, you better step up and improve your mindset and act as a decent person. Or you keep your view and probably lose contact with your son all together....", "YTA.  I'd be very curious how this would be written from his point of view.  BTW plenty of successful people didn't finish college.  Plenty of happy families are blended.  You don't have to have a biological connection to be family.  You've made it clear your so-called \"love\" is conditional.  I think he's right to cut you off from his family.  Based on what you've written you're controlling, judgemental, and toxic.  I'm sure he and his family will have a better life without you in it.  Which is very sad.", "YTA. It's not about a book, is it? It's that you're literally angry at your son for somehow having the capacity to love Bonnie as his own. You have two granddaughters now, and until you realize this, and earn your son and his family's respect, you won't have access to any of them.", "YTA. Your son has accepted Bonnie as his kid and you should accept her or butt out of their family. Of course they didn't tell you!!!! They think you are a bad grandfather!  And an unborn child can't read a book. Bonnie can and they were right to let her read it.\n\nYou are being petty and immature and can't give conditional gifts to one child and not the other. They will go NC with you if you keep this us and they should.", "YTA in such a big way. Is your heart so small and mean that you can't accept the woman and the child your son loves? If that's the case, expect to lose your son and your bio grandchild too. And you deserve to lose them. I have 2 step-grandchildren and expect to have 2 more in the near future. You know how I treat them? Exactly the way I treat the bio grandkids. And having these new grandkids in my life has enriched it beyond belief. Open your heart to your son's family (all of them!) and apologize for being such a jerk. You'll reap the reward of love and closeness that will fill up your empty heart.", "YTA\n\nAnd you best change your name, because \u201cloving grandpa\u201d doesn\u2019t fit when you take out on a young child the fact of her birth. It\u2019s not her fault she was born.\n\nYour son, he\u2019s a real man. He\u2019s able to love a child that isn\u2019t his, without question. He wants to treat his kids equally, like good parents do.\n\nYou know what\u2019s really good about this? The fact that he\u2019s doing right by his family, and not allowing a toxic arsehole into their lives.", "You have the right not to accept Bonnie as your grandchild. But they have the right to ensure that their children are treated equally and that there\u2019s no favorites. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to like it, but you do need to accept that he\u2019s not \u201cplaying daddy.\u201d  It\u2019s been 5 years. He made the choice to accept that little girl as his own. And it\u2019s long past time for you to accept that.", "YTA. Your son is the father of Susie, and while not biological, that doesn\u2019t negate it. You are being cruel to a child that your son accepted. And his student loans and income are for him to decide. Low wage workers are inherently less important than high wage workers, and in many cases arguably more important.\n\nYou either need to reevaluate your mindset or accept that you will have no contact with your son or grandchildren.", "YTA YTA YTA YTA YTA.\n\nGiven how horrible you are to Susie and Bonnie, I'm not surprised that he chooses to keep you at arm's length from his new family.\n\nBonnie is just as much your grandchild as this other one is.

You're going to go down in your son's family history as the bitter, angry, hate filled old man that no one loved because he was just that horrid. Your legacy will be that you were a mediocre father at first who turned into a toxic waste dump that the family had to avoid. Enjoy it. You've earned it.", "YTA.

And to be honest, if I had a young son, I wouldn't want him taking on that sort of responsibility either, at least not before figuring his own life out more, but, it's his decision ultimately.\n\nEqually, his new family could be giving him more joy than the alternative. The thing is, he's only going to resent you more for making him feel like he's made the wrong decisions, whether they are wrong or not.
