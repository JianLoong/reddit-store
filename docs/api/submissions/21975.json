My husband is fully aware that I don't let anyone outside of my oldest drink from my jug. I don't even let my husband because hes always eating something and I don't want backwash. \n\nWell, I got up from nursing our daughter on the couch to go put her in her crib and when I got back out, his daughter was drinking from my water jug. The kitchen was literally 2 steps away. I asked why she was drinking from my jug when she knows I don't allow that and she says \"dad told me to because he's doing dishes and doesn't want me in there\".

Yeah, I can but that's not the point at all and I told him that. It's a boundary issues.
