Backstory first:\n\nI have a group of friends, some of whom I met via groupchats and zoom calls at the start of the pandemic.  I've met most of them in person at this point, one of whom (I'll call her Nancy?) lives in another state, but was visiting about 2 years ago so we got to meet in person.  Nancy is married, but I've never met her partner in person as she didn't come with her - we've only briefly talked on the group video calls in 2020-2021.\n\nSo after meeting Nancy, her partner decided that I'm a terrible person and she isn't comfortable with the two of us talking.  At all.  To be clear, nothing happened when I met her - we were always with a group of people, we didn't flirt, we were friendly because we were friends.  I only know that she thinks I'm a terrible because of mutual friends telling me this.\n\nThe event:  After the first meeting, we talked regularly for a couple of months, and then Nancy went radio silent.  I figured whatever, she's busy with life, not a big deal, went on with my life.  Every few months, I'll get a text from her to \"check in\", then back to silence - it's not a conversation, she'll ask how I'm doing, and then nothing.  Mutual friends told me a few weeks ago that it's because her partner will sulk and mope around if they think we've been talking, so she will unblock my number, \"check in\", then delete the conversation and re-block me.  Because \"Well she values you as a friend, but has to keep it secret so Partner doesn't get sad\"\n\nSo I reached out to her via Facebook, told her that I would just delete her contact info, and move on.  I don't consider what we have a friendship at this point, and I refuse to be treated as a secret in anyone's life.

I think you summarized it perfectly OP. NTA.", "NTA. You are correct - you are both adults and these games benefit no one. That really isn't a friendship anymore so you are right to step away.", "NTA that is called integrity. She doesn\u2019t have it. you do.", "NTAH. And its weird that she thinks its ok to need to keep friendships secret.", "Lots of suspect behavior.   None of us know you or what's behind her reasons but a few things to ponder:   (1) Could Nancy be in an abusive relationship an to keep the peace she's engaged in this 'check in' and block/re-block behavior?   Is she in danger?  (2) Could Nancy be using your as a pawn or playing games at your expense in her relationship battles with her spouse?    Sometimes I've seen threats of another relationship when the heat is on.    \n\nSo I would see if you can determine if she is in some kind of danger first and be a friend if she needs it.  If it's games play or using your as a chess piece, drop her like a hot potato as I wouldn't want to be used like that.", "NTA, but it seems that she's in a controlling relationship, so you should be a little forgiving.", "NTA. Everything you said is accurate.", "NTA. There's no benefit to this relationship. It's all on Nancy's terms, and she's an AH to her partner for lying about not being friends with you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It sounds like Nancy wants to stay friends/in touch with you but her partner is exerting undue control over her, which she at present doesn't seem to be able to get out from under. \n\nYou don't have to be involved in this situation, but calling her childlike & dramatic may have been a bit too far & simplistic for a situation that seems, at least to me, complicated & quite sad.", ">I don't consider what we have a friendship at this point\n\nAnd it's not. Does she think a quick text is sustaining you? Like you can't go on without her friendship? \n\nNTA, it sucks but some friendships don't last, but that doesn't mean the time spent together isn't still special.", "NTA\nAnd seeing it from someone else's perspective does not mean you have to agree or tolerate the choices they make.", "If only more people nipped the drama in the bud!!! Good on OP!!!", "NTA but I feel like there is more to this story\u2026", "Because Going slightly against the grain to say NAH (except Nancy's partner, maybe). Here me out.\n\nNancy wants friends who share a mutual interests and her partner seems fine with it while they are distant but immediately becomes hostile after you meet for the first time (which they weren't there for) to the point that nancy has to block you, but still wants to talk to you/cares about you so has to limit it to a brief check in?\n\nI think u/ptazdba has the right of it. Either Nancy's partner is jealous and insecure or downright abusive and sabotaging Nancy's friendships so she has noone else she can turn to.\n\nIf you're the only person Nancy's partner has done this to maybe they are just a bit insecure or have trouble trusting strangers from the internet but if they've done this to a lot of Nancy's friends I'd start to wonder.", "There\u2019s no obligation to tell us you are posting from a throw away.", "NTA \n\nThis is ridiculous and her perspective and the way she is treating you is awful. You are entitled to yours if she is entitled to hers.", "NTA", "You couldve been nicer, but NTA", "Jealousy is just ugly. If I were Nancy this spouse would be my EX. NTA", "NTA\u2026totally agree with you.  We are not in high school anymore.", "It seems Nancy has relationships with other friends, so not totally isolated .  These people would be in a better position to help her.  OP should not contact Nancy anymore because she doesn\u2019t want to be part of drama.", "if you figure it out, feel free to let me know.  I can only speak to what I know, which is what's above.", "If Nancy didn't have other friends and was clearly being isolated, I'd agree with you, but OP says they have mutual friends, and Nancy is able to physically visit them along with keeping in touch online, so while it's still wild that her wife is trying to control this one friendship, it's not like Nancy has no other friends to talk to. In which case, I do lean more toward Nancy being childish than desperate.", "So to clarify your last points.\n\nYes, I am the only person that this restriction exists for (at least as far as I know).\n\nShe met other \"strangers from the internet\" (from the same group chats and zoom calls that we \"met\" from) at the same time as me, who don't get the same response from her partner.\n\nAlso all of the \"mutual friends\" from the chat have known me in person for a decade or so, and have known her even longer.  Like yeah I met her in person for the first time and we only started talking in the group during covid, but it's not like we didn't know about one another for years beforehand.  We were just never in the same area to be properly introduced", "Moreso meant that the throwaway itself is the obligated part, not the disclosure.", "If more people did than this sub would be a lot less interesting! \ud83d\ude06", "(Not that it matters, but I'm a He not a She)", "Does anyone in the group have ANY idea whatsoever why this person is convinced you're evil? Are you the only man in the friend group, maybe?", "No it\u2019s not.", "True dat! This sub would no longer exist!", "Not that they've told me.\n\nNot the only man in the group at all - it's about a 50/50 split.  Of the other men in the group, I'm also not the only one that's single.", "It is for me.", "How bizarre. Well, you're definitely NTA, but if you ever find out what is going on, maybe let us know!", "Says who?", "Says me.\n\nYou don't feel an obligation to use a throwaway, by all means don't use a throwaway.  I do."]}
