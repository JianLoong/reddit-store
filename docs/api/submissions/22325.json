Nancy is married, but I've never met her partner in person as she didn't come with her - we've only briefly talked on the group video calls in 2020-2021.\n\nSo after meeting Nancy, her partner decided that I'm a terrible person and she isn't comfortable with the two of us talking.  At all.  To be clear, nothing happened when I met her - we were always with a group of people, we didn't flirt, we were friendly because we were friends.  I only know that she thinks I'm a terrible because of mutual friends telling me this.\n\nThe event:  After the first meeting, we talked regularly for a couple of months, and then Nancy went radio silent.  I figured whatever, she's busy with life, not a big deal, went on with my life.  Every few months, I'll get a text from her to \"check in\", then back to silence - it's not a conversation, she'll ask how I'm doing, and then nothing.  Mutual friends told me a few weeks ago that it's because her partner will sulk and mope around if they think we've been talking, so she will unblock my number, \"check in\", then delete the conversation and re-block me.  Because \"Well she values you as a friend, but has to keep it secret so Partner doesn't get sad\"\n\nSo I reached out to her via Facebook, told her that I would just delete her contact info, and move on.  I don't consider what we have a friendship at this point, and I refuse to be treated as a secret in anyone's life.

None of us know you or what's behind her reasons but a few things to ponder:   (1) Could Nancy be in an abusive relationship an to keep the peace she's engaged in this 'check in' and block/re-block behavior?   Is she in danger?  (2) Could Nancy be using your as a pawn or playing games at your expense in her relationship battles with her spouse?    Sometimes I've seen threats of another relationship when the heat is on.    \n\nSo I would see if you can determine if she is in some kind of danger first and be a friend if she needs it.  If it's games play or using your as a chess piece, drop her like a hot potato as I wouldn't want to be used like that.", "NTA, but it seems that she's in a controlling relationship, so you should be a little forgiving.", "NTA.

It sounds like Nancy wants to stay friends/in touch with you but her partner is exerting undue control over her, which she at present doesn't seem to be able to get out from under. \n\nYou don't have to be involved in this situation, but calling her childlike & dramatic may have been a bit too far & simplistic for a situation that seems, at least to me, complicated & quite sad.", ">I don't consider what we have a friendship at this point\n\nAnd it's not. Does she think a quick text is sustaining you? Like you can't go on without her friendship? \n\nNTA, it sucks but some friendships don't last, but that doesn't mean the time spent together isn't still special.", "NTA\nAnd seeing it from someone else's perspective does not mean you have to agree or tolerate the choices they make.", "If only more people nipped the drama in the bud!!! Good on OP!!!", "NTA but I feel like there is more to this story\u2026", "Because Going slightly against the grain to say NAH (except Nancy's partner, maybe). Here me out.\n\nNancy wants friends who share a mutual interests and her partner seems fine with it while they are distant but immediately becomes hostile after you meet for the first time (which they weren't there for) to the point that nancy has to block you, but still wants to talk to you/cares about you so has to limit it to a brief check in?\n\nI think u/ptazdba has the right of it. Either Nancy's partner is jealous and insecure or downright abusive and sabotaging Nancy's friendships so she has noone else she can turn to.\n\nIf you're the only person Nancy's partner has done this to maybe they are just a bit insecure or have trouble trusting strangers from the internet but if they've done this to a lot of Nancy's friends I'd start to wonder.", "[removed]", "NTA \n\nThis is ridiculous and her perspective and the way she is treating you is awful.

I can only speak to what I know, which is what's above.", "If Nancy didn't have other friends and was clearly being isolated, I'd agree with you, but OP says they have mutual friends, and Nancy is able to physically visit them along with keeping in touch online, so while it's still wild that her wife is trying to control this one friendship, it's not like Nancy has no other friends to talk to. In which case, I do lean more toward Nancy being childish than desperate.", "So to clarify your last points.\n\nYes, I am the only person that this restriction exists for (at least as far as I know).\n\nShe met other \"strangers from the internet\" (from the same group chats and zoom calls that we \"met\" from) at the same time as me, who don't get the same response from her partner.\n\nAlso all of the \"mutual friends\" from the chat have known me in person for a decade or so, and have known her even longer.  Like yeah I met her in person for the first time and we only started talking in the group during covid, but it's not like we didn't know about one another for years beforehand.

I'm sure you are aware that messages carried by third parties are not that reliable (it's why courts do not recognize hearsay evidence). Unconsciously, we all color and edit the things we report of other's speech and actions based on our unique prejudices.\n\nUntil you hear anything directly from Nancy, consider taking all that these \"mutual friends\" carrying tales about Nancy so much background noise.\n\nYou were right to make an independent decision about whether or not to keep the lines of communication open with Nancy. If you drop her, she no longer -- assuming these friends takes are accurate -- has to engage in all those machinations just to drop you a word or two on the sly.\n\nSecrecy between romantic partners is a time bomb waiting to explode; you don't want to be enmeshed in that deception in any way.", "NTA Though if she is in an abusive situation (partner is minimally manipulative) she could be told you'd consider a friendship when she has figured out how this is wrong and is in a more stable place in her life.", "Your friends 'partner' is really insecure but that's not on you.

Your friend and her partner female. \nI'm curious about what genders are your common friends.

What do you mean by \u201ccommon friends \u201c?", "But Nancy clearly has the independence to make and keep friends. Yes, her wife is trying to control that, but Nancy can make the decision herself whether to allow that or not. Unless we have a genuine reason to believe that Nancy is in an abusive relationship and therefore will face consequences for her actions, at the moment it sounds like this is just one area where Nancy's wife is causing a problem.\n\nI acknowledge that it *could* be worse, but so far we know nothing to support that and can only make a judgment based on what OP knows: Nancy has online friends that she is able to meet in person, and those friends include single men other than OP (I'd assume the same applies to women in the group too), and OP is the only one Nancy's wife has a problem with. To me, that's definitely weird, but it doesn't scream abuse the way it would if Nancy's wife had a problem with all the single men in the group.", "No coercive control starts with total isolation. It's incremental. And even if it is one area of Nancy's life where undue control is being exerted, that's still sad & wrong."]}
