Backstory first:\n\nI have a group of friends, some of whom I met via groupchats and zoom calls at the start of the pandemic.  I've met most of them in person at this point, one of whom (I'll call her Nancy?) lives in another state, but was visiting about 2 years ago so we got to meet in person.  Nancy is married, but I've never met her partner in person as she didn't come with her - we've only briefly talked on the group video calls in 2020-2021.\n\nSo after meeting Nancy, her partner decided that I'm a terrible person and she isn't comfortable with the two of us talking.  At all.  To be clear, nothing happened when I met her - we were always with a group of people, we didn't flirt, we were friendly because we were friends.  I only know that she thinks I'm a terrible because of mutual friends telling me this.\n\nThe event:  After the first meeting, we talked regularly for a couple of months, and then Nancy went radio silent.  I figured whatever, she's busy with life, not a big deal, went on with my life.  Every few months, I'll get a text from her to \"check in\", then back to silence - it's not a conversation, she'll ask how I'm doing, and then nothing.  Mutual friends told me a few weeks ago that it's because her partner will sulk and mope around if they think we've been talking, so she will unblock my number, \"check in\", then delete the conversation and re-block me.  Because \"Well she values you as a friend, but has to keep it secret so Partner doesn't get sad\"\n\nSo I reached out to her via Facebook, told her that I would just delete her contact info, and move on.  I don't consider what we have a friendship at this point, and I refuse to be treated as a secret in anyone's life.  We're not children, and I'm too old for this drama.\n\nApparently this upset her, and mutual friends are calling me an asshole for not \"seeing it from her perspective\"", "created_utc": 1689440792, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/150h9a7/aita_for_telling_someone_im_not_comfortable_with/", "score": 42, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I think you summarized it perfectly OP. NTA.", "NTA. You are correct - you are both adults and these games benefit no one. That really isn't a friendship anymore so you are right to step away.", "NTA that is called integrity. She doesn\u2019t have it. you do.", "NTAH. And its weird that she thinks its ok to need to keep friendships secret.", "Lots of suspect behavior.   None of us know you or what's behind her reasons but a few things to ponder:   (1) Could Nancy be in an abusive relationship an to keep the peace she's engaged in this 'check in' and block/re-block behavior?   Is she in danger?  (2) Could Nancy be using your as a pawn or playing games at your expense in her relationship battles with her spouse?    Sometimes I've seen threats of another relationship when the heat is on.    \n\nSo I would see if you can determine if she is in some kind of danger first and be a friend if she needs it.  If it's games play or using your as a chess piece, drop her like a hot potato as I wouldn't want to be used like that.", "NTA, but it seems that she's in a controlling relationship, so you should be a little forgiving.", "NTA. Everything you said is accurate.", "NTA. There's no benefit to this relationship. It's all on Nancy's terms, and she's an AH to her partner for lying about not being friends with you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It sounds like Nancy wants to stay friends/in touch with you but her partner is exerting undue control over her, which she at present doesn't seem to be able to get out from under. \n\nYou don't have to be involved in this situation, but calling her childlike & dramatic may have been a bit too far & simplistic for a situation that seems, at least to me, complicated & quite sad.", ">I don't consider what we have a friendship at this point\n\nAnd it's not. Does she think a quick text is sustaining you?
