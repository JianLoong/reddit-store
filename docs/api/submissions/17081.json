Even if the argument stops, the tension is there when she enters and lingers for as long as the unresolved issue remains. She will be negatively impacted and view her grandfather as her dad's enemy even if she can't figure out why she feels that way. She's not a pawn. She's a child, and she should be removed from tenuous situations, not sent to the front lines.", "NTA that is absolutely an unsafe environment for her to be in.", "NTA. It\u2019s not the responsibility of a 2 year old to regulate 2 grown ass men. That\u2019s hella fucked up. And will definitely do damage to your daughter. Read family drama by Nedra Tawaab. https://www.nedratawwab.com/", "NTA. She is 2 years old and she\u2019s being used like a bomb diffusion dog, this is an incredibly volatile situation for her to be put in. Of course his family doesn\u2019t see anything wrong with it, they would rather use a child as a pawn than make the two grown adults sit down and hash it out. It\u2019s much easier for them this way. Hold your ground and protect your daughter from this insane scenario.", "NTA. Children that age are like sponges, soaking up everything they see & hear; you are 100% doing the right thing by trying to keep her away from aggressive/argumentative adults.", "NTA. Don't even need to read the post. Title alone tells me everything I need. You're an amazing parent, and are ABSOLUTLEY making the right choice. Stick to your guns, and maybe if this continues, look into sole custody.", "This is a bit tricky because I can understand not wanting to expose a 2-year-old to grown men arguing. But I did notice OP did not say fighting as in physical, and this is the daughter's family whether you like it or not, so she will probably be exposed to them arguing for years to come and I don't think it is realistic for you to be able to police that. My concern is the ultimatum and the hard line OP is taking. These things can usually be worked out, even if it isn't the perfect solution or what OP would want, that is still the two-year-old daughter's father and family and, barring seriously harmful and extenuating circumstances, it isn't right to pull rank and not allow visits. I understand not liking this situation but... YTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

NTA", "NTA. They can get counseling or anger management courses on their own time. Kids may not be able to express their emotions well at that age, but they can definitely absorb them", "NTA those men need to learn emotional regulation and not rely on a little toddler . that is so messed up of them to do , they are ADULTS . if ADULTS can\u2019t stop arguing without a LITTLE CHILD PRESENT then they need to get help .", "Yeah, no.  No child should be used as a peacemaker and forced to get into the middle of things so an argument stops.  That's not really healthy for the kid and I speak from experience.\n\nNTA", "NTA. All I can say is WOW. I can\u2019t imagine putting a child into that situation purposely. You\u2019re not unreasonable but your ex\u2019s family have no business any where near children since they feel using them as pawns is an acceptable way of raising a child!", "NTA.", "I think your ex should get points for never arguing in front of his daughter and immediately stopping if he sees her. That is an admirable decision of him to commit to.\n\nHe still needs to work on not arguing at family gatherings (he and his dad should schedule a time to hash things out in private) and his family completely sucks for teaching a 2 year old it's her job to be a comfort object/ limiter for adults.\n\nI'm leaning towards she can be trusted with her dad, so long as he promised he won't take her to anything involving grandpa during his time with her, but the other relatives need to chill for a bit and will have to have you supervising if they want to see her.\n\nNTA", "Someone needs to go in the room and hang a metal spoon against a pan and yell at both of them.

And what if they don't stop? Could she hear or see things she shouldn't or be injured?", "She may also internalize that tension & think she herself is causing a problem or they don\u2019t like her. Kids think crazy things sometimes when they don\u2019t understand a situation .", "Also time to point out to the ex that fights like that in the  HOUSE where his child is aren't acceptable. Stopping just because she's in the room isn't good enough. Everyone, including his child, can hear them fighting; that's why other family members are sending her in. Being in a house with that continually going on, even if you aren't sent into the middle of it as a circuit breaker, is unhealthy and traumatising. OP needs to explain this to her ex, and explain custody may need to be revisited if he can't provide a safe home environment.", "True. Especially when she's constantly put in the battlezone.", "NTA. Even though the arguing stops immediately, there's gotta be some amount she hears. It's not healthy to use a toddler to break up an argument between adults. They need to do the exact opposite and take her away from the arguing.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nWhat the hell is wrong with these people?", "NTA\n\nThis is sick behavior and honestly, though this is beside the point, this seems to be being used as a way to get your ex to cave to his dad.", "The reality is that everybody has fights, and every kid is going to be exposed to fights. But, yes, it's worth talking about minimizing the arguments. In and of itself, fighting is probably not, in the eyes of a court, enough to revisit custody.", "YTA. If they agree to stop the behavior, why would you create a situation here ? Are there no arguments in your home ?", "NTA \n\nA kid doesn\u2019t need tk be around all that tension. \n\nAlso, imagine how much she hears and sees before they notice her!", "NTA. WTAF is wrong with your ex inlaws? She may not remember it, but she will grow up with that trauma just below the surface. You are doing your job to protect your child from emotional or psychological damage.", "Let\u2019s not even comprehend the lesson she\u2019s learning\u2026to be a people-pleasing peacekeeper.
