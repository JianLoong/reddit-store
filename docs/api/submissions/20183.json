No help from either of our families. I preferred\u00a0to keep the wedding smaller and 90 is actually a cut down list from 180.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n  \nOne of the people cut was a cousin (27F) I grew up with who if didn't have a service dog would have been invited, and honestly could have been in the running to be a bridesmaid.\u00a0 We grew up together and were close growing up.\u00a0 Sometime during college she got a service dog.\u00a0 This is when I stopped hanging out with her outside of family functions.\u00a0 Its a dog for PTSD and I don't know what the task its trained for is. I don't know what the cause of her PTSD is either.\u00a0\n\n  \nI just don't like dogs and don't view any dogs favorably.\u00a0 My family knows this and until now had never been an issue.\u00a0 Because of her Service Dog we just grew apart.\u00a0 There was never any argument or event that happened, our lives just went separate ways.\u00a0 I also met my fiance and had a group of college friends I\u00a0started hanging out with.\u00a0 Before these questions\u00a0come up, I'm not allergic, I was never bit by a dog, there is no\u00a0trauma.\u00a0 Dogs just aren't for me.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n  \nInvites were sent out and I got a message from my cousin asking where her invite was.\u00a0 \u00a0 My Aunt (her mom) was talking about my wedding.\u00a0 I told her she wasn't invited and we had to cut the guest list down.\u00a0 She said that I don't get why she didn't make the cut, we were close for a long time and kept pressing.\u00a0 Finally I told her that I don't want a dog at my wedding.\u00a0 It took her a day to respond to that, but by that point I had heard from my Mom and Aunt and several family members.\u00a0 I held firm.\u00a0 I'm paying for the whole thing, I'm controlling that day and who is there.\u00a0 I finally compromised and texted my cousin she could come but her dog wasn't invited.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n  \nThat set off a shitstorm for her that came down on me.\u00a0 I answered a call from her and all I heard was yelling on the other end.\u00a0 I hung up.\u00a0 This was followed by many text messages calling me an asshole, i'm ableist, etc.\u00a0 This drama has been going on for over a week now and its\u00a0a few months until the wedding.\u00a0 There is a faction of family that have said they are declining now.\u00a0 They are using my mom to pressure me or pressuring her into not coming.\u00a0 My mom is supporting me because its my wedding and i'm paying for it.\u00a0 AITA here?\u00a0\u00a0", "created_utc": 1687298778, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14eoum9/aita_for_not_inviting_a_family_member_with_a/", "score": 609, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It fulfills a medical need for someone who you apparently never really cared about in the first place.", "it\u2019s super telling the kind of person you are that you let a close friend go because\u2026 she has a service dog and dogs just \u201caren\u2019t for you\u201d. i\u2019m not the biggest dog fan either but damn! you must have never cared about her for *that* to be the reason you stopped being close. \n\nYTA massively, for both the wedding and for ending the friendship over something so petty. does she know that\u2019s why you guys grew apart?", "You are absolutely Ableist.

You admit you still are close enough to her for her to be in the bridal party if not for the dog. Nobody is forcing you to hug the dog. You don't have to pay attention to it. In fact, you'd probably be so busy on your wedding day that you wouldn't even notice it for longer than a second. Just invite her to the wedding without having her in the bridal party.", "YTA - You never even asked what the service dog was for or about her PTSD. Thats it for me right there. You claimed to be close with her too. \n\nAnything else after that doesnt matter for me.", "YTA I would have a different opinion if this was a badly behaved ESA but this is a service dog. It's pretty much like you saying a person who uses a walker or a wheelchair can't come because those things squick you out. I agree with your cousin.", "INFO - if she was blind and had a guide dog, would you have made a different choice?

You didn't show one inch of interest?", "YTA. Yup, it\u2019s your wedding and you\u2019re paying for it. You get to do what you want. People also get to decide they won\u2019t attend the wedding if someone so rude, selfish, insensitive and ableist that they would uninvite a family member who has done nothing wrong just because they require a service animal. \n\nAnd how the fuck would it be a \u2018compromise\u2019 that she can come but not her dog? If the issue was always her dog, why is it a compromise on your end to allow her to come?\n\nIt\u2019s notable that you two used to be close but you seem to have have zero empathy for whatever trauma she went through that led her to need this service dog.\n\nI\u2019m glad her family is standing with her and she\u2019s better off without you in her life.", ">who if didn't have a service dog would have been invited, and honestly could have been in the running to be a bridesmaid. \n\nYTA. You are not inviting this person because they have a disability and you don't like the way they manage their disability.", "It depends. If the dog is a legitimately-trained service dog, it will be better behaved than many of your guests, and it's in poor taste not to invite someone strictly because of they have a service animal. \n\nOn the other hand, if the dog is an \"emotional support animal\" rather than a highly-trained working dog, then absolutely no problems not allowing the dog to attend.", "INFO: emotional support animal or psychiatric service dog because bigggg difference", "You knew this was not going to be well received but you went down this path. Now you need to deal with the shit storm you caused. \n\nThere was a 100 ways you could have handled this better but you choose not too. Now your butt hurt family is mad and are trying to make them the bad guys.\n\nYou could have easily said do to the fact that fianc\u00e9 and I are paying for this we had to make some tough decisions. Unfortunately we had to cut 90 people.

I can't invite her to the wedding.\" \n\nThe service dog is a medical device just like any other medical device. The fact that you haven't even bothered to find out or ask about the PTSD is just another AH factor. You and your cousin were close and could still be close but you have chosen to ignore her mostly over a dog to the point that you are not even in the know about a significant life event that changed her forever.", "YTA. \"Dogs aren't for me\" is such a stupid fucking reason to not invite your cousin", "YTA. You're really ignorant and an extremely petty person. It's your wedding and you can invite whoever but cutting out your cousin for her having a service dog is petty AF.  \nI hope she now cuts you out of her life.", "YTA service dogs aren\u2019t pets. You don\u2019t seem to have any good justification for why a dog wouldn\u2019t be possible at this wedding and 90 people isn\u2019t that small", "As someone who volunteers and donates to organizations who train dogs for veterans with PTSD, Seeing Guides for the blind and Canine Companions for Independence - you are entitled to your feelings. Your wedding, your rules. But it doesn't absolve you from being a AH. Big time. Your family member should be fine about not going to your wedding. You sound like a drag. Not liking dogs is your choice, but it says a lot about you. You're discriminating.", "YTA it\u2019s your wedding, you can do whatever you want. Doesn\u2019t stop you from being the shitty person you are.", "You're right, you can invite whomever you want. \n\nBut if it were a scenario where you actively didn't invite somebody who uses a wheelchair because 'wheelchairs aren't for you', and then told the person they could come but not to bring their wheelchair... well, yes, that's an asshole move. \n\nYTA but that's your prerogative at your own party. Nobody *has* to accommodate for disabilities at their wedding but it does demonstrate your character, so I'm not surprised others have declined your invite.", "YTA kind of. While it's your wedding and your guest list, which you are free to invite or not invite for any reason at all, let me give you perspective on how you came across:\n\nI didn't invite my cousin because I don't like wheelchairs, and she needs one for medical reasons.\n\nHow's that sound to you? This isn't a \"pet\" - this is a very expensive highly trained medical detector who has a very specific job to perform and is specifically trained for your cousin.

That doesn't make you NOT an asshole. \n\nYTA beyond any doubt. \n\nWould you fail to invite your cousin if they'd a service dog for their sight?

Oh, wait, that's now.", "YTA\n\nYour cousin (to whom you were very close) suffered a traumatic event. Instead of supporting her, knowing what had happened to her, making an effort to maintain a friendship with a person who was having a hard time, you decided to stay away from her because you don't like dogs? What do you consider a friendship? Close enough to make her a bridesmaid, but not close enough to make the effort to help her? You don't like dogs, I get it, but no one is forcing you to have one or to take care of one (besides her dog is working, not asking for cuddles if it is properly trained and titled).", "YTA, it\u2019s a service dog. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re a dog fan or not that\u2019s an AH move. Especially it being your own cousin wth.", "YTA. Just because you don\u2019t know about the trauma doesn\u2019t mean it didn\u2019t happen. You are owed no explanation. Your cousin however is owed an apology.", "YTA\nAnd not just because I love dogs\u2026\nYour cousin, to whom you were close has PTSD. You have never bothered to find out what happened to her and you just excluded her from your life because she has a service dog to help her cope. You are such a fairweather friend!! \nAs for the wedding invite, you are correct that if you pay, you chose who is invited\u2026 but it doesn\u2019t mean that excluding this cousin for this reason doesn\u2019t make you an AH.", "YTA. You admit you were close and that she could have been in your wedding party,  but for the dog.   And you admit haven't even bothered to find out the reason for the dog.  It sounds like your relationship never really mattered to you, and now it's dividing your family.  That sucks.", "Damn OP, you suck, seriously. Im not even gonna go into it, you can read the several walls of text detailing your blatant lack of empathy and goofiness. What a joke.", "YTA. Seriously, shame on you.", "YTA - if they were close enough to be running for a bridesmaid you were still close until recently.  I don't  think we are getting the whole story.  Someone doesn't be in the running to be a bridesmaid if you drifted apart during college years and I don't think you were engaged for multiple years.", "YTA and honestly, wedding or not, you come across as the most self-centred individual. You never even asked your own cousin why she had PTSD? Who are you? Saying things like, \"She could have been in the running to be a bridesmaid.\" Are you not embarrassed?", "Why do you mention the fact that you are paying for the wedding so many times. You know that's the norm and it goes without saying right?

We can move past the complete and utter ignorance and ableism here (for only a few seconds)\u2026\n\nYou literally stopped being close with her because she got a dog? Do you realize how insane that sounds? You can\u2019t even be in the presence of a dog, so you\u2019d rather drop people who are important to you? Yikes,\n\nNow back to the ableism and your complete ignorance on the purpose of service dogs. The fact that you wouldn\u2019t want her to have a tool that helps her is one of the more selfish things I\u2019ve heard in a while.

And you didn't even care enough to ask your cousin about her PTSD in order to help plan interactions?\n\nI mean, sure, you can exclude anyone from your Perfect Day for any reason. This reason, though, makes you an asshole, as well as a bad friend.\n\nYTA, and you have been for a very long time.", "I wouldn't necessarily call you the A-Hole since it is your and your partner's wedding and in the end you decide who can come and who can't.\n\nHowever you must then face the truth that there's a big chance that those who are close with your cousin and care about her will most likely turn their back on you afterwards as well which is also their right to do. \n\nI can get that you may not like dogs but out of all dogs a service animal is not too big of a hassle in comparison to most other. You most likely would only see it sitting with your cousin but other than that they are trained to behave and handle stressful events and situations and most importantly: Keep your cousin safe! That dog is her life line and she depends on it now, so it isn't about 'she can come without the dog', it has to be her and the dog or she can't come at all. \n\nPlease keep in mind that your cousin would most likely not try to force a dog into your wedding if they had the choice not to as they seem to care about you, but they do not have that choice.\n\nAgain, in the end, your wedding your decision but it will very likely leave the family situation tense and you may not be able to redeem that damage.", "That would depend. Is it a real service animal or a bs \"emotional support animal\"", "I went back and forth on this but I'm deciding YTA. Yes, it's your wedding and you get to choose who does and doesn't come. But your reason for not inviting this specific cousin is a pretty bad one, if I'm being honest. It's not because cousin has done something to you, it's not because her service dog, or any dog, has done anything to you, you're not allergic, you just don't like dogs. Normally I wouldn't mind that but you're putting your dislike of dogs over your cousin. Unless this dog has a history of misbehaving, can you really not tolerate it's presence for a few hours?", "YTA\n\nThis sounds incredibly petty.", "NTA I'm disabled and a part of that means I can't go to certain things. It's nobody's fault, just how it is. Being disabled doesn't mean the world conforms to you. It's YOUR day. Do it your way. You've done nothing wrong.", "mmmmm YTA. ordinarily I'm all about that \"it's your day have who you want\", but this feels pretty icky and exclusionary for no real good reason, and this is a person who is so important to you that you claim you would want them to be a bridesmaid. You also sound super dismissive of mental health issues. So yeah you can invite who you want, but this backlash is very understandable.", "YTA. It sorta sounds like you and your cousin drifted apart after she developed a disability and while I do not know you and cannot call you ableist, it raises some questions for me. Regardless, to not invite your cousin, whom you otherwise would consider making a bridesmaid, because she has a disability and needs a service animal to manage it is really crappy. Like sure, it\u2019s your wedding and you can do whatever you want, but this is not great.", "YTA, it's a SERVICE DOG. It's trained. You are ableist. It's okay not to be a dog person, but you have to understand that service dogs are also considered medical equipment. Yes, they are a pet, but they are taught to work when they have that vest on. This was not the only bad thing you've done. The fact you drifted on from her because she got a dog? That's bogus.", "YTA. do you know how service dogs work? it will literally just be sitting next to her the whole time, recieving no attention or ever looking away from the person its servicing", "YTA. She needed help and you disowned her.", "YTA: sorry you don't like dogs but like wow. I've cut off family before but I couldn't imagine telling a friend/family member with PTSD so bad that they need a whole ass service animal, that I won't be around them if they utilize said service animal.", "YTA because you\u2019re treating your cousin badly. \n\nBut it\u2019s your wedding so you can do whatever you want.", "As someone who uses a service dog you are absolutely an ableist and an asshole for letting the friendship grow apart because she needs and uses a medical device that happens to be in canine form. You\u2019re free to invite or not invite anyone you wish to your wedding while placing whatever ridiculous conditions on the invitation that you want but doing so makes YTA", "YTA 100%. You do have a right to choose who comes to your wedding, but not inviting someone because they have a service dog is ableist, that dog is a medical aid, it's the equivalent of asking someone not to bring a mobility aid they need to get around because you don't want it in the pictures.", "Yta.  Change the service dog to a wheelchair in this scenario in your head and maybe you will see it clearer.  If you said you didn\u2019t want your cousin at your wedding because she had a wheelchair and you didn\u2019t like the way wheelchairs looked etc.\n\nService dogs aren\u2019t pets. They are medical aides for people with disabilities.  Her service dog enables her to function more fully in the world.", "i knew this was a yta from the header", "YTA.  Your wedding your choice however; you yourself stated you used to be close with this cousin and the only reason they were not invited was the dog.  You grew apart for no reason other than the dog, despite how you try to play it. \n\nYou don\u2019t even know the source of their PTSD or the task the dog is trained to perform?  That says a lot about you.  One phone call with the person you grew up so close with could have answered this questions.  Instead of reaching out, asking questions and discussing concerns you decided to simply exclude them.\n\nIt\u2019s a service dog - not a pet.  It will not be there looking for attention from you or anyone else. The cousin was not cut from the list for any other reason, family is right to decline to attend in support of your cousin.\n\nBut hey, good news, now you can start inviting some of those healthy people you previously cut.  \n\nCan\u2019t help but wonder if OP is actually concerned the cousin\u2019s service dog will take attention away from her?", "They're calling you ableist because you are ableist. If this was a business or workplace, what you're doing would be illegal and a human rights violation. You can do whatever you want at your wedding, but the choices you make come with consequences. YTA.", "Yta also you got reposted to amithedevil so thats silly", "YTA,\n\nMostly because of the the supposed compromise of inviting her but saying that service dog she needs can\u2019t come\u2026you can\u2019t be that ignorant to suggest that and insensitive. Just wow", "YTA. It\u2019s your wedding, you can invite or not whoever you want. But if your entire reason for not inviting your cousin (who you\u2019ve already purposefully drifted away from) is that they have a service dog then yes, you\u2019re an asshole and you need to accept all the flack you\u2019re deservedly going to get for that.", "YTA. You don\u2019t have a right or a need to know why your cousin has PTSD or how her service dog helps her. It\u2019s not okay to tell her that she can\u2019t bring her medical equipment, which is what her dog is. I\u2019d be more understanding if you had a severe fear or allergy, but as neither is true I just have to assume you\u2019re ableist and extremely unempathetic.", "YTA. Perhaps if you thought it was one of those faux service animals, like a \u201ccomfort flamingo\u201d or whatever, but your cousin has PTSD enough to need it, and you\u2019re TA enough to not even ask why your cousin needs it in the first place.", "YTA.  Big time.  Not even gonna bother trying to explain this one - if you don't realise it already guess you never will.", "YTA. Yes, your wedding, your rules, but it's insanely self-centered, insensitive, and irrational to let a close relationship fall apart because the other person...got a dog.", "YTA. It\u2019s a service dog and you\u2019re discriminating against her.\n\nThank God she has that sweet dog who\u2019s trained to deal with someone in emotional distress to help her through your betrayal.", "YTA though yes, you can include or exclude anyone you want from your wedding, the fact that you\u2019re not inviting her due to her service dog makes you an asshole that\u2019s so big you\u2019re visible from space.\n\nYou\u2019re not a good person.", "Wow this is actually pretty disgusting. YTA.", "Something terrible could happen to you any day now, and leave you wheelchair-bound blind or needing a service dog. I wonder what everyone would think of you, and I want you to think really hard about what you\u2019re doing YTA", "YTA I find it incredibly strange that you let go of a close relationship just because you don't like dogs.\n\nI'd get limiting contact if you had a phobia or were allergic but to basically just... end a friendship because you just *don't like* dogs? And a *service* dog at that? Is the dog being there going to bother you so much that you'd rather someone who was supposedly important to you and by your own admission has done nothing wrong not be there?\n\nI dunno, I don't think your cousin was ever that important to you, honestly. It's your wedding so you're free to do as you please, but it's pretty hard to be sympathetic.", "YTA\n\nShe wouldn't bring a pet. It's a trained dog that sticks close. You suck.", "You don\u2019t have to invite anyone you don\u2019t want - this is very true.  Your not an asshole for not inviting her, your an asshole for how you have handled this whole thing. \n\nYou should have expected and planned for the outrage.  This isn\u2019t some friend you lost contact with. This is a member of your family - did you think people wouldn\u2019t be pissed?  \n\n\nYTA - you could have given her a heads up.  You could have handled this very differently. You didnt, now you can deal with the fallout.", "YTA", "YTA. While you're allowed to decide who you do and don't want to come to your wedding, the choices you make will come with consequences. When you decide to cut out a family member that you used to be close to simply because of something they have for medical purposes, of course that will have rippling effects. If \"I don't want you around or in my life because I don't vibe with your medical support for no particular reason\" is truly the hill you want to die on then no one can stop you, but you can't expect that people will be rallying to support for excluding someone with a disability, or that such a reason won't color the way people think about you. Because make no mistake, it's very cruel to decide to place \"I just don't like dogs\" over the feelings and needs of someone you supposedly care about.", "YTA and you can do what you want. \n\n\u201cI told my cousin who has no legs and uses a wheelchair that she could come but she can\u2019t bring her wheelchair.

Does it absolve you from shitty behaviour? No. But that's your right, but I don't understand why people keep posting about these scenarios like they expect people to agree with them. Do what you want, but I could do without another post about this.", "YTA.\nThis is someone who was \u201cin the running\u201d to be your bridesmaid otherwise! And this is how you treat her? You didn\u2019t even care enough to ask why she NEEDS the service dog to begin with?!? \n\nThat\u2019s pretty f\u2019ed up, but unfortunately the damage is done. Even if you invited her now, it\u2019s only because of pressure from others, and they already think YTA, so that probably won\u2019t change. Get ready for a long future of uncomfortable family gatherings (if they even invite you). \n\nDisclaimer: if this was an untrained emotional support animal, I would feel differently. If the dog is a true service dog, I stand by my judgement.", "You have every right to not want dogs at your wedding, with that said YTA, because while it\u2019s your right doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not an AH thing, you\u2019re basically discriminating against someone for a disability, how you can\u2019t comprehend that is beyond me", "If she has PTSD and you don't know anything about the cause, you either were never close or you stopped being close way before she was given a medical support animal.

Movement Tasks\r  \nPTSD service dogs can also perform several movement tasks to assist their owners\r  \n\r  \nThey may block the handler from moving toward a dangerous situation, for example, or circle the handler as a form of crowd control in a busy location. They can also pull wheelchairs, check rooms for intruders to ensure the owner they\u2019re in a safe place or deliver notes to get help when the owner is struggling.\r  \n\r  \n4. Guide Tasks\r  \nIf someone with PTSD is struggling to navigate on their own, whether they have vision problems or not, a psychiatric service dog can perform guide tasks to help. They may guide the owner to an exit or specific location, bring them to a particular item or person, or guide them home while making sure they avoid moving objects.\r  \n\r  \n5.

Op doesn't have to invite cousin, but she is the AH for given the dog as reason to exclude her. It's not much different from not inviting someone who is in a wheelchair.", "It's a service dog. Not a pet for pleasure. It would be the same as a bride not inviting a wheelchair bound guest because she thought wheelchairs were unsightly. Does the bride have the 'right' to invite anyone they want? Yes. Does that excuse them from being an asshole? No.", "It would indeed have been more tactical to give another bland reason (I am so very sorry we had to limit the number of guests because of money issues/whatever). It is obvious she did not make the cut and therefore you do not count her among your closest, that can be hurtful but more understandable and less likely to get the flak from half of your family.", "Those are the same type of people that if their ESA was denied entry somewhere would pitch a fit.", "I don\u2019t think they can or if so it can\u2019t be exorbitant.  Like the place I live I sent my cat to live with my parents. It was pet free.  I could have cheated the system and got an ESA certificate but to me that is bogus.  If I could have found a wheelchair access apartment that allowed him great but small town so I took what I could.  Had to get a waiver to move in anyway as it is a 60+ apartment complex and I\u2019m significantly under.

I was curious to see whether it was a service dog or a pet dog that came to your wedding. Thank you for answering!", "Her shared humanity owes that accommodation. The service dog was the only thing stopping OP from having an ongoing relationship with, or inviting to the wedding. OP's lacks basic compassion, and it's repugnant.", "Thats not analogous at all.

OP is the AH for literally stunting her cousin's ability to function by disallowing a trained service animal from attending simply because she doesnt like dogs.", "I'll be the AH and say it. Nobody wants to see someone have a PTSD episode at their wedding. It's distracting, it's unsettling. Eliminating the possibility of it happening certainly covers that. Just bc they have a dog to help them cope doesn't eliminate the possibility. PTSD can be triggered by being anxious (wedding, check) in crowds (wedding, check) around strangers (wedding, check)\n\nIt's your day, you do you honey!!", "No where did she mention it was NOT an actual service dog. Stay to the point here instead of running out on a tangent.", "OP is still the AH because if she truly did care about her cousin, she'd know what happened and whether it was genuinely trained.

Also from the family's reaction it's not an ESA.", "Yes this totally. My sister has a \"service dog\" In reality it is just a dog she bought and is calling it a service dog.

OP flat out states it's a service animal.  We can surely let that go now.", "If the cousin has diagnosed PTSD, then it\u2019s not the same as someone slapping a harness on their regular pet and saying it\u2019s an ESA.

OP said nothing except that she doesn't know what caused the PTSD of what tasks the dog performs, which implies that the dog does perform tasks. \n\nShe literally ditched her traumatized cousin because she's \"not a dog person\". OP is a single-ply human being.", "Just because OP doesn\u2019t know what task the dog performs doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not a service dog.

Service dogs are highly trained dogs who perform one or more specific tasks to help with a disability. A service dog for someone with PTSD might help the owner get to a safe location during a panic attack, provide compression to lessen the symptoms of a trauma response, or guide other people to assist the owner. Even though many people think of PTSD as a \u201cmental disorder\u201d that only requires emotional support, people with PTSD can and do use service dogs in the same way that someone with a seizure disorder might use a service dog.\n\nGenerally, service dogs are very expensive to train and care for. Their owners also face a lot of discrimination from people who don\u2019t understand service dogs. (Case in point, OP.)\n\nMost people choose to use a service dog because it is a better option than any other accessibility aid available to them. Sure, people also have \u201cdown time\u201d with their dog and enjoy spending time with their pet, but when the dog is working it\u2019s doing a serious job.", "OP says that it is a service dog not an emotional support dog. \n\nService dogs are chosen from birth and must go through special training, they are absolutely \"one of those\". They are not pets, they usually aren't even legally owned by the user; you are provided a trained service dog and are responsible for it like any other medical device.", "It's hard to say.

Also her allowing them to drift apart purely because her cousin has a service dog?? Maybe it\u2019s just me but it reads like she thinks that PTSD is bullshit.

And if she asked \"AITA for not thinking people should have service dogs?\". that would be a y-t-a from me.  But, tone aside, what she asked about was the wedding invite.

Emotional support pets are not required to have any training and are not medical devices. I\u2019m not sure how to make this any more clear for you. I could literally pick up a random dog off the street and say it\u2019s my emotional support dog.
