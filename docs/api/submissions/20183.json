No help from either of our families. I preferred\u00a0to keep the wedding smaller and 90 is actually a cut down list from 180.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n  \nOne of the people cut was a cousin (27F) I grew up with who if didn't have a service dog would have been invited, and honestly could have been in the running to be a bridesmaid.\u00a0 We grew up together and were close growing up.\u00a0 Sometime during college she got a service dog.\u00a0 This is when I stopped hanging out with her outside of family functions.\u00a0 Its a dog for PTSD and I don't know what the task its trained for is. I don't know what the cause of her PTSD is either.\u00a0\n\n  \nI just don't like dogs and don't view any dogs favorably.\u00a0 My family knows this and until now had never been an issue.\u00a0 Because of her Service Dog we just grew apart.\u00a0 There was never any argument or event that happened, our lives just went separate ways.\u00a0 I also met my fiance and had a group of college friends I\u00a0started hanging out with.\u00a0 Before these questions\u00a0come up, I'm not allergic, I was never bit by a dog, there is no\u00a0trauma.\u00a0 Dogs just aren't for me.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n  \nInvites were sent out and I got a message from my cousin asking where her invite was.\u00a0 \u00a0 My Aunt (her mom) was talking about my wedding.\u00a0 I told her she wasn't invited and we had to cut the guest list down.\u00a0 She said that I don't get why she didn't make the cut, we were close for a long time and kept pressing.\u00a0 Finally I told her that I don't want a dog at my wedding.\u00a0 It took her a day to respond to that, but by that point I had heard from my Mom and Aunt and several family members.\u00a0 I held firm.\u00a0 I'm paying for the whole thing, I'm controlling that day and who is there.\u00a0 I finally compromised and texted my cousin she could come but her dog wasn't invited.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n  \nThat set off a shitstorm for her that came down on me.\u00a0 I answered a call from her and all I heard was yelling on the other end.\u00a0 I hung up.\u00a0 This was followed by many text messages calling me an asshole, i'm ableist, etc.\u00a0 This drama has been going on for over a week now and its\u00a0a few months until the wedding.\u00a0 There is a faction of family that have said they are declining now.\u00a0 They are using my mom to pressure me or pressuring her into not coming.\u00a0 My mom is supporting me because its my wedding and i'm paying for it.\u00a0 AITA here?\u00a0\u00a0", "created_utc": 1687298778, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14eoum9/aita_for_not_inviting_a_family_member_with_a/", "score": 6902, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Yes.\n\nAre you an asshole for excluding someone on the basis of a disability? Also yes. \n\nThe dog is a medical device, not a pet. It doesn\u2019t matter if you like dogs or not, because it\u2019s (the dog, not the wedding) not about you. It fulfills a medical need for someone who you apparently never really cared about in the first place.\n\nEdit-YTA", "it\u2019s super telling the kind of person you are that you let a close friend go because\u2026 she has a service dog and dogs just \u201caren\u2019t for you\u201d. i\u2019m not the biggest dog fan either but damn! you must have never cared about her for *that* to be the reason you stopped being close. \n\nYTA massively, for both the wedding and for ending the friendship over something so petty. does she know that\u2019s why you guys grew apart?", "You are absolutely Ableist. I'm a wheelchair user. My Service Dog picks up items I drop, can pull my chair, can alert for seizures. If I'm overwhelmed, he's trained to make a barrier between me and people.

You admit you still are close enough to her for her to be in the bridal party if not for the dog. Nobody is forcing you to hug the dog. You don't have to pay attention to it. In fact, you'd probably be so busy on your wedding day that you wouldn't even notice it for longer than a second. Just invite her to the wedding without having her in the bridal party.", "YTA - You never even asked what the service dog was for or about her PTSD. Thats it for me right there. You claimed to be close with her too. \n\nAnything else after that doesnt matter for me.", "YTA I would have a different opinion if this was a badly behaved ESA but this is a service dog. It's pretty much like you saying a person who uses a walker or a wheelchair can't come because those things squick you out. I agree with your cousin.", "INFO - if she was blind and had a guide dog, would you have made a different choice? Is it actually because of the dog or is it because you feel like you don\u2019t have all the details on her disability so you don\u2019t believe she actually needs the dog?", "What's going to happen if your soon-to-be husband or soon-to-be in laws need to get a service dog for any reason?", "YTA\n\nThe dog is her tool.\n\nYou wouldn't take the wheelchair from someone who can't walk or the stick from a blind person?\n\n> Its a dog for PTSD and I don't know what the task its trained for is.\n\nYou never bothered to ask? You didn't show one inch of interest?", "YTA. Yup, it\u2019s your wedding and you\u2019re paying for it. You get to do what you want. People also get to decide they won\u2019t attend the wedding if someone so rude, selfish, insensitive and ableist that they would uninvite a family member who has done nothing wrong just because they require a service animal. \n\nAnd how the fuck would it be a \u2018compromise\u2019 that she can come but not her dog? If the issue was always her dog, why is it a compromise on your end to allow her to come?\n\nIt\u2019s notable that you two used to be close but you seem to have have zero empathy for whatever trauma she went through that led her to need this service dog.\n\nI\u2019m glad her family is standing with her and she\u2019s better off without you in her life.", ">who if didn't have a service dog would have been invited, and honestly could have been in the running to be a bridesmaid. \n\nYTA. You are not inviting this person because they have a disability and you don't like the way they manage their disability.", "It depends. If the dog is a legitimately-trained service dog, it will be better behaved than many of your guests, and it's in poor taste not to invite someone strictly because of they have a service animal. \n\nOn the other hand, if the dog is an \"emotional support animal\" rather than a highly-trained working dog, then absolutely no problems not allowing the dog to attend.", "INFO: emotional support animal or psychiatric service dog because bigggg difference", "You knew this was not going to be well received but you went down this path. Now you need to deal with the shit storm you caused. \n\nThere was a 100 ways you could have handled this better but you choose not too. Now your butt hurt family is mad and are trying to make them the bad guys.\n\nYou could have easily said do to the fact that fianc\u00e9 and I are paying for this we had to make some tough decisions. Unfortunately we had to cut 90 people. We each had to cut people we truly loved but ultimately decided by if you have not been an active part of our lives for x amount of years we didn\u2019t invite you.\n\nBut no you choose the nuclear option and like I said earlier are butt hurt because everyone called you out.

I can't invite her to the wedding.\" \n\nThe service dog is a medical device just like any other medical device. The fact that you haven't even bothered to find out or ask about the PTSD is just another AH factor. You and your cousin were close and could still be close but you have chosen to ignore her mostly over a dog to the point that you are not even in the know about a significant life event that changed her forever.", "YTA. \"Dogs aren't for me\" is such a stupid fucking reason to not invite your cousin", "YTA. You're really ignorant and an extremely petty person. It's your wedding and you can invite whoever but cutting out your cousin for her having a service dog is petty AF.  \nI hope she now cuts you out of her life.", "YTA service dogs aren\u2019t pets. You don\u2019t seem to have any good justification for why a dog wouldn\u2019t be possible at this wedding and 90 people isn\u2019t that small", "As someone who volunteers and donates to organizations who train dogs for veterans with PTSD, Seeing Guides for the blind and Canine Companions for Independence - you are entitled to your feelings. Your wedding, your rules. But it doesn't absolve you from being a AH. Big time. Your family member should be fine about not going to your wedding. You sound like a drag. Not liking dogs is your choice, but it says a lot about you. You're discriminating.", "YTA it\u2019s your wedding, you can do whatever you want. Doesn\u2019t stop you from being the shitty person you are.", "You're right, you can invite whomever you want. \n\nBut if it were a scenario where you actively didn't invite somebody who uses a wheelchair because 'wheelchairs aren't for you', and then told the person they could come but not to bring their wheelchair... well, yes, that's an asshole move. \n\nYTA but that's your prerogative at your own party. Nobody *has* to accommodate for disabilities at their wedding but it does demonstrate your character, so I'm not surprised others have declined your invite.", "YTA kind of. While it's your wedding and your guest list, which you are free to invite or not invite for any reason at all, let me give you perspective on how you came across:\n\nI didn't invite my cousin because I don't like wheelchairs, and she needs one for medical reasons.\n\nHow's that sound to you? This isn't a \"pet\" - this is a very expensive highly trained medical detector who has a very specific job to perform and is specifically trained for your cousin.

That doesn't make you NOT an asshole. \n\nYTA beyond any doubt. \n\nWould you fail to invite your cousin if they'd a service dog for their sight?

Oh, wait, that's now.", "YTA\n\nYour cousin (to whom you were very close) suffered a traumatic event. Instead of supporting her, knowing what had happened to her, making an effort to maintain a friendship with a person who was having a hard time, you decided to stay away from her because you don't like dogs? What do you consider a friendship? Close enough to make her a bridesmaid, but not close enough to make the effort to help her? You don't like dogs, I get it, but no one is forcing you to have one or to take care of one (besides her dog is working, not asking for cuddles if it is properly trained and titled).", "YTA, it\u2019s a service dog.

Just because you don\u2019t know about the trauma doesn\u2019t mean it didn\u2019t happen. You are owed no explanation. Your cousin however is owed an apology.", "YTA\nAnd not just because I love dogs\u2026\nYour cousin, to whom you were close has PTSD. You have never bothered to find out what happened to her and you just excluded her from your life because she has a service dog to help her cope. You are such a fairweather friend!! \nAs for the wedding invite, you are correct that if you pay, you chose who is invited\u2026 but it doesn\u2019t mean that excluding this cousin for this reason doesn\u2019t make you an AH.", "YTA. You admit you were close and that she could have been in your wedding party,  but for the dog.   And you admit haven't even bothered to find out the reason for the dog.  It sounds like your relationship never really mattered to you, and now it's dividing your family.  That sucks.", "Damn OP, you suck, seriously. Im not even gonna go into it, you can read the several walls of text detailing your blatant lack of empathy and goofiness. What a joke.", "YTA. Seriously, shame on you.", "YTA - if they were close enough to be running for a bridesmaid you were still close until recently.  I don't  think we are getting the whole story.  Someone doesn't be in the running to be a bridesmaid if you drifted apart during college years and I don't think you were engaged for multiple years.", "YTA and honestly, wedding or not, you come across as the most self-centred individual. You never even asked your own cousin why she had PTSD? Who are you? Saying things like, \"She could have been in the running to be a bridesmaid.\" Are you not embarrassed?", "Why do you mention the fact that you are paying for the wedding so many times. You know that's the norm and it goes without saying right?

We can move past the complete and utter ignorance and ableism here (for only a few seconds)\u2026\n\nYou literally stopped being close with her because she got a dog? Do you realize how insane that sounds? You can\u2019t even be in the presence of a dog, so you\u2019d rather drop people who are important to you? Yikes,\n\nNow back to the ableism and your complete ignorance on the purpose of service dogs. The fact that you wouldn\u2019t want her to have a tool that helps her is one of the more selfish things I\u2019ve heard in a while.

And you didn't even care enough to ask your cousin about her PTSD in order to help plan interactions?\n\nI mean, sure, you can exclude anyone from your Perfect Day for any reason. This reason, though, makes you an asshole, as well as a bad friend.\n\nYTA, and you have been for a very long time.", "I wouldn't necessarily call you the A-Hole since it is your and your partner's wedding and in the end you decide who can come and who can't.\n\nHowever you must then face the truth that there's a big chance that those who are close with your cousin and care about her will most likely turn their back on you afterwards as well which is also their right to do. \n\nI can get that you may not like dogs but out of all dogs a service animal is not too big of a hassle in comparison to most other. You most likely would only see it sitting with your cousin but other than that they are trained to behave and handle stressful events and situations and most importantly: Keep your cousin safe! That dog is her life line and she depends on it now, so it isn't about 'she can come without the dog', it has to be her and the dog or she can't come at all. \n\nPlease keep in mind that your cousin would most likely not try to force a dog into your wedding if they had the choice not to as they seem to care about you, but they do not have that choice.\n\nAgain, in the end, your wedding your decision but it will very likely leave the family situation tense and you may not be able to redeem that damage.", "That would depend. Is it a real service animal or a bs \"emotional support animal\"", "I went back and forth on this but I'm deciding YTA. Yes, it's your wedding and you get to choose who does and doesn't come. But your reason for not inviting this specific cousin is a pretty bad one, if I'm being honest. It's not because cousin has done something to you, it's not because her service dog, or any dog, has done anything to you, you're not allergic, you just don't like dogs. Normally I wouldn't mind that but you're putting your dislike of dogs over your cousin. Unless this dog has a history of misbehaving, can you really not tolerate it's presence for a few hours?", "YTA\n\nThis sounds incredibly petty.", "NTA I'm disabled and a part of that means I can't go to certain things. It's nobody's fault, just how it is. Being disabled doesn't mean the world conforms to you. It's YOUR day. Do it your way. You've done nothing wrong.", "mmmmm YTA. ordinarily I'm all about that \"it's your day have who you want\", but this feels pretty icky and exclusionary for no real good reason, and this is a person who is so important to you that you claim you would want them to be a bridesmaid. You also sound super dismissive of mental health issues. So yeah you can invite who you want, but this backlash is very understandable.", "YTA. It sorta sounds like you and your cousin drifted apart after she developed a disability and while I do not know you and cannot call you ableist, it raises some questions for me. Regardless, to not invite your cousin, whom you otherwise would consider making a bridesmaid, because she has a disability and needs a service animal to manage it is really crappy. Like sure, it\u2019s your wedding and you can do whatever you want, but this is not great.", "YTA, it's a SERVICE DOG. It's trained. You are ableist. It's okay not to be a dog person, but you have to understand that service dogs are also considered medical equipment. Yes, they are a pet, but they are taught to work when they have that vest on. This was not the only bad thing you've done. The fact you drifted on from her because she got a dog? That's bogus.", "YTA. do you know how service dogs work? it will literally just be sitting next to her the whole time, recieving no attention or ever looking away from the person its servicing", "YTA. She needed help and you disowned her.", "YTA: sorry you don't like dogs but like wow. I've cut off family before but I couldn't imagine telling a friend/family member with PTSD so bad that they need a whole ass service animal, that I won't be around them if they utilize said service animal.", "YTA because you\u2019re treating your cousin badly. \n\nBut it\u2019s your wedding so you can do whatever you want.", "As someone who uses a service dog you are absolutely an ableist and an asshole for letting the friendship grow apart because she needs and uses a medical device that happens to be in canine form. You\u2019re free to invite or not invite anyone you wish to your wedding while placing whatever ridiculous conditions on the invitation that you want but doing so makes YTA", "YTA 100%. You do have a right to choose who comes to your wedding, but not inviting someone because they have a service dog is ableist, that dog is a medical aid, it's the equivalent of asking someone not to bring a mobility aid they need to get around because you don't want it in the pictures.", "Yta.  Change the service dog to a wheelchair in this scenario in your head and maybe you will see it clearer.  If you said you didn\u2019t want your cousin at your wedding because she had a wheelchair and you didn\u2019t like the way wheelchairs looked etc.\n\nService dogs aren\u2019t pets. They are medical aides for people with disabilities.  Her service dog enables her to function more fully in the world.", "i knew this was a yta from the header", "YTA.  Your wedding your choice however; you yourself stated you used to be close with this cousin and the only reason they were not invited was the dog.  You grew apart for no reason other than the dog, despite how you try to play it. \n\nYou don\u2019t even know the source of their PTSD or the task the dog is trained to perform?  That says a lot about you.  One phone call with the person you grew up so close with could have answered this questions.  Instead of reaching out, asking questions and discussing concerns you decided to simply exclude them.\n\nIt\u2019s a service dog - not a pet.  It will not be there looking for attention from you or anyone else. The cousin was not cut from the list for any other reason, family is right to decline to attend in support of your cousin.\n\nBut hey, good news, now you can start inviting some of those healthy people you previously cut.  \n\nCan\u2019t help but wonder if OP is actually concerned the cousin\u2019s service dog will take attention away from her?", "They're calling you ableist because you are ableist. If this was a business or workplace, what you're doing would be illegal and a human rights violation. You can do whatever you want at your wedding, but the choices you make come with consequences. YTA.", "Yta also you got reposted to amithedevil so thats silly", "YTA,\n\nMostly because of the the supposed compromise of inviting her but saying that service dog she needs can\u2019t come\u2026you can\u2019t be that ignorant to suggest that and insensitive. Just wow", "YTA. It\u2019s your wedding, you can invite or not whoever you want. But if your entire reason for not inviting your cousin (who you\u2019ve already purposefully drifted away from) is that they have a service dog then yes, you\u2019re an asshole and you need to accept all the flack you\u2019re deservedly going to get for that.", "YTA. You don\u2019t have a right or a need to know why your cousin has PTSD or how her service dog helps her. It\u2019s not okay to tell her that she can\u2019t bring her medical equipment, which is what her dog is. I\u2019d be more understanding if you had a severe fear or allergy, but as neither is true I just have to assume you\u2019re ableist and extremely unempathetic.", "YTA. Perhaps if you thought it was one of those faux service animals, like a \u201ccomfort flamingo\u201d or whatever, but your cousin has PTSD enough to need it, and you\u2019re TA enough to not even ask why your cousin needs it in the first place.", "YTA.  Big time.  Not even gonna bother trying to explain this one - if you don't realise it already guess you never will.", "YTA. Yes, your wedding, your rules, but it's insanely self-centered, insensitive, and irrational to let a close relationship fall apart because the other person...got a dog.", "YTA. It\u2019s a service dog and you\u2019re discriminating against her.\n\nThank God she has that sweet dog who\u2019s trained to deal with someone in emotional distress to help her through your betrayal.", "YTA though yes, you can include or exclude anyone you want from your wedding, the fact that you\u2019re not inviting her due to her service dog makes you an asshole that\u2019s so big you\u2019re visible from space.\n\nYou\u2019re not a good person.", "Wow this is actually pretty disgusting. YTA.", "Something terrible could happen to you any day now, and leave you wheelchair-bound blind or needing a service dog.

And a *service* dog at that? Is the dog being there going to bother you so much that you'd rather someone who was supposedly important to you and by your own admission has done nothing wrong not be there?\n\nI dunno, I don't think your cousin was ever that important to you, honestly. It's your wedding so you're free to do as you please, but it's pretty hard to be sympathetic.", "YTA\n\nShe wouldn't bring a pet. It's a trained dog that sticks close. You suck.", "You don\u2019t have to invite anyone you don\u2019t want - this is very true.  Your not an asshole for not inviting her, your an asshole for how you have handled this whole thing. \n\nYou should have expected and planned for the outrage.  This isn\u2019t some friend you lost contact with. This is a member of your family - did you think people wouldn\u2019t be pissed?  \n\n\nYTA - you could have given her a heads up.  You could have handled this very differently. You didnt, now you can deal with the fallout.", "YTA", "YTA. While you're allowed to decide who you do and don't want to come to your wedding, the choices you make will come with consequences. When you decide to cut out a family member that you used to be close to simply because of something they have for medical purposes, of course that will have rippling effects. If \"I don't want you around or in my life because I don't vibe with your medical support for no particular reason\" is truly the hill you want to die on then no one can stop you, but you can't expect that people will be rallying to support for excluding someone with a disability, or that such a reason won't color the way people think about you. Because make no mistake, it's very cruel to decide to place \"I just don't like dogs\" over the feelings and needs of someone you supposedly care about.", "YTA and you can do what you want. \n\n\u201cI told my cousin who has no legs and uses a wheelchair that she could come but she can\u2019t bring her wheelchair.

Do what you want, but I could do without another post about this.", "YTA.\nThis is someone who was \u201cin the running\u201d to be your bridesmaid otherwise! And this is how you treat her? You didn\u2019t even care enough to ask why she NEEDS the service dog to begin with?!? \n\nThat\u2019s pretty f\u2019ed up, but unfortunately the damage is done. Even if you invited her now, it\u2019s only because of pressure from others, and they already think YTA, so that probably won\u2019t change. Get ready for a long future of uncomfortable family gatherings (if they even invite you). \n\nDisclaimer: if this was an untrained emotional support animal, I would feel differently. If the dog is a true service dog, I stand by my judgement.", "You have every right to not want dogs at your wedding, with that said YTA, because while it\u2019s your right doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not an AH thing, you\u2019re basically discriminating against someone for a disability, how you can\u2019t comprehend that is beyond me", "If she has PTSD and you don't know anything about the cause, you either were never close or you stopped being close way before she was given a medical support animal.

Movement Tasks\r  \nPTSD service dogs can also perform several movement tasks to assist their owners\r  \n\r  \nThey may block the handler from moving toward a dangerous situation, for example, or circle the handler as a form of crowd control in a busy location. They can also pull wheelchairs, check rooms for intruders to ensure the owner they\u2019re in a safe place or deliver notes to get help when the owner is struggling.\r  \n\r  \n4. Guide Tasks\r  \nIf someone with PTSD is struggling to navigate on their own, whether they have vision problems or not, a psychiatric service dog can perform guide tasks to help. They may guide the owner to an exit or specific location, bring them to a particular item or person, or guide them home while making sure they avoid moving objects.\r  \n\r  \n5.

It's a service dog, and they do have service dogs for people with PTSD. These dogs are specifically trained for the task, and they are trained to behave.  The dog isn't going to jump on you, shit wherever it pleases, or steal food off the table.  Service dogs also wear vests that say they are service dogs and not to interact with them unless its owner tells someone otherwise.\n\nThink of it this way, OP: since the dog is a service dog, they can't be legally banned from most settings. Service dogs are allowed to go most places the person goes.\n\nOf course, you can make your choices about who you invite to your wedding, but choices come wi5h consequences.", "If the dog truly is a service dog then YTA.  The fact is you can invite who you want to your wedding for any reason and honestly you don\u2019t have to justify to anyone but your future spouse. \n\nHowever I will add my personal experience.  I am deaf and encountered many actual service dogs and far more \u201cfake\u201d untrained pets that people just call service animals as an excuse to bring them wherever they want.  You can almost always tell by the behavior of both the animal and the owner.  The actual trained service animal is professional and rarely messes around.  The untrained animal is usually poorly behaved, is not one of the typical breeds for that type of service animal and the owner treats it like a pet than a professional while working. I have no experience with emotional support animals but I suppose it might be the same. \n\nI do know that landlords and such can ask for a doctors note saying the service animal is required- they cannot ask what the disability is.  This is not discrimination but allows people with disabilities to have the animals where they would not normally be allowed like a pet free apartment. If you truly don\u2019t know if this is a service animal or a trumped up let you could go this route possibility.  Your family might still think your are a jerk but you can get past it and done.", "If it\u2019s a legitimate service animal, you\u2019re the AH.\n\nIf it\u2019s just an emotional support animal and the cousin is doing the thing where they buy the little fake vest and try to pass it off as a legitimate service animal despite it having none of the training\u2026NTA. \n\nDogs can be incredibly destructive, particularly if they do t receive the actual training of a legitimate service animal. If it hasn\u2019t been trained, it\u2019s likely to get really upset when it finds itself in an environment with 100 people acting strangely in close quarters.

I am also not entirely convinced dog is a true service animal rather than an ESA. There is a growing number of service animal handlers who are publicly outraged (and rightly so) of the general public\u2019s use of fake service vests and ESAs in public settings that put true service animals in danger because of a lack of training and control over fake animals.

My PTSD isn\u2019t real either because I clearly \u201cwasn\u2019t abused\u201d in their eyes\u2026  so they \u201cdon\u2019t know\u201d why I would have it either.", "Sounds like me, I was told my molesting \"couldn't have happened, 8 year olds don't know what that (sex) is.\"\n\nGhost hugs to you.", "Ugh im sorry.

I can not begin to guess at your feelings (although I suspect they vary depending on the time, day and circumstances. I only feel comfortable making this \u201cinformed\u201d guess bc I know that my feelings vary as a person who has experienced a different type of trauma.) \n\nI truly hope that you have found people (and access to 1 or more  service animals since the trauma)  who will be there to love and lift you up when you feel a bit down, support you and celebrate your triumphs & successes. A family built by choice and held together with love and care vs one that was yours by chance and held together by misdeeds, lies and money. YOU DESERVE A FAMILY AND SUPPORT TEAM OF YOUR CHOOSING & so many other good things!!!!!  I am sending you my best wishes for many good things to come your way. Side note- Thank you for inspiring me on a day zI needed it. \n\nIn relation to the wedding post- your story helped describe my first thoughts after reading it.  OP\u2019s description of her relationship w/ the cousin, how/when they \u201cgrew apart\u201d and OP\u2019s willful blindness to her cousin\u2019s PTSD and need for help (which she speaks of so dismissively) struck me as both strange yet entirely plausible. My mind immediately went to some kind of sexual or domestic partner abuse. I pictured them happily running in a similar friend group UNTIL the cousin experienced some kind of misconduct by a mutual friend or even a friend of someone OP admired/had a crush on. (I have seen young women forsake lifetime friends to take the side of a new bf or even a crush in college/early adulthood.) I can\u2019t say for sure why sexual or physical abuse jumped to the front of my mind - only that, it was my immediate thought. I imagined the cousin gathering the strength to tell the truth about the (alleged) harmful conduct (physical, sexual or both) to OP, hoping to get some support from her close family member. Instead, by her own admission, OP was unwilling to learn about or even acknowledge the source of her cousin\u2019s trauma(including why she needed the service animal) and chose to move on with the new friend group.  (Note- For me, the actual designation of the dog is not the issue, espec since OP has no dog related trauma and is not allergic. OP says the cousin needs the dog, a fact the broader family understands and accepts. So for me, the issue is the treatment of a family member not whether the dog is a service animal or support animal.) The idea that Op & cousin WERE was very close but OP doesn\u2019t have a clue what caused her cousin\u2019s PTSD is unfathomable. It is more likely, imo, that OP shut down any attempt by cousin to share the source of the trauma  and chose to go forward w/ the preferred friend group (perhaps w/ the alleged perpetrator in it) w/out the cousin. This is particularly heartbreaking, if true, bc it sounds like the cousin truly needed OP and she was completely abandoned- which may have limited her ability to heal as much as she may have otherwise. OP\u2019s willful blindness/purposeful distancing seems like it could  have been at least as traumatic to cousin as the original trauma the cousin experienced bc it was perpetrated by a person the cousin loved and trusted vs a social acquaintance. For me, I think OP\u2019s behavior (abandonment, ignoring trauma, etc.) would cause a deeper wound than almost anything a casual friend or relative stranger could do. \n\nOP- YTA on too many levels to list. Your wedding is a day for you & your future husband to stand up and ask others to recognize AND SUPPORT your love and marriage. If you truly want to take the approach that \u201cit is our day and ONLY about the 2 of us\u201d then ELOPE! Note- I DO believe the b&g get to make reasonable choices (e.g., no plus ones for casual daters, no children IF they understand it means some invitees won\u2019t attend, etc.) BUT to exclude loved ones who need medical accommodations- something that would be unlawful in most other settings- wow. Not to worry though- you won\u2019t need to decide to elope. Sounds like your family has it covered & will be gifting you a \u201cmicro-wedding\u201d based on the # of family members now opting to decline your invitation. \n\nWonder if OP\u2019s future husband KNOW about OP\u2019s failure to support the cousin (at the time of the trauma, in the years after and/or now?) How can OP\u2019s future hubby trust OP to provide lifelong future support? OP- what if your husband develops blindness, diabetes, PTSD or another condition that REQUIRES a service animal - or you do??? \n\nOP - I hope your cousin keeps you at the distance you deserve!! As for @activelyresting, I hope you continue to thrive . Thank you for showing others there is life after trauma, there are people w/ ethics whose character is not for sale and the actions of 1 person (YOU!) can have a positive impact on others every day! inspiring strangers on the daily!!!", "This never should have happened to you and I hope you get the opportunity to see karma grant your awful family everything they have earned.", "My husband , kids and myself are all allergic to animals and yet we have dogs and a cat at the house.

Animals are just SO much better then people are and OP story just proves it.", ">They were so close that the cousin \u201chonestly could have been in the running to be a bridesmaid!\u201d\n\nThis also stood out for me.

I have PTSD. I didn\u2019t tell my extended family about it for a really long time.

She\u2019s now the member of my family that knows the most about what caused my PTSD and what methods I use to keep it at bay. \n\nIf OP and the cousin had truly been close before the cousin\u2019s trauma and before she got her service dog, OP could absolutely have approached her cousin in a similar way and learned to maintain that closeness. But she decided that her hatred for dogs mattered more than her love for her cousin. That on its own makes her YTA.", "No shit, but at least it shows some effort and interest in your family member.

Chances are that their subconscious behavior looks threatening to the dog.", "Dogs cant sense bad they can sense intent.
