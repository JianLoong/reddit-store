She needed to live in a more expensive area and commute for work; I was in subsidised housing. So even though our income skewed one way, our disposable income may have skewed the other.\n\nI also believe that splits like this shouldn't necessarily be linear with the income proportion; money is a lot more valuable when you have less of it.

You are simply hoping to continue that precedent.\r  \n\r  \nYour incomes have changed, but you want to re-evaluate the proportional split to ensure it remains fair to your current means, rather than flip it completely to 50/50. A proportional split avoids imbalance and resentment. 50/50 could become unfair if incomes change again in the future.\r  \n\r  \nYou have tried to have a reasonable, open discussion about this with your girlfriend to express why the proportional approach continues to make sense to you. You want to feel heard and for your perspective to be validated as well.\r  \n\r  \nYou do not begrudge your girlfriend's success and increased earning potential. You want to find a compromise that accounts for that while also ensuring the split remains fair and balanced overall based on abilities to contribute.\r  \n\r  \nYou have contributed equally to household responsibilities, chores and finances based on your shared agreement. You feel that should continue now that incomes have adjusted rather than flip the script entirely.\r  \n\r  \nYou expressed a willingness to re-evaluate the proportional split to make adjustments as needed and find a \"50/50-ish\" compromise. You are not being unreasonable or unwilling to meet in the middle.\r  \n\r  \nYour girlfriend has not presented a reasonable, balanced perspective on why the 50/50 split is clearly fairer and more equitable. Only that she does not want to \"punish herself\" for her success.\r  \n\r  \nIn summary, you have approached this sensitive financial situation with your partner fairly, reasonably, and openly.

It reflects extremely poorly on her that she's not willing to do the same.

He could have advised me not to take redundancy and keep working until I had another job (especially since I\u2019m the primary bread winner). I might not have followed his advice, but at least we would have talked about it and I was able to consider his opinions. \n\nHe told me to do what I thought was best. But I can imagine that would have gone very differently if I just came home one day and announced to him I was taking redundancy. \n\nIt\u2019s not about entitlement or telling people what to do. It\u2019s about basic respect for your partner. It\u2019s about planning together and tackling life as a team."]}
