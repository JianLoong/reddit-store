She was ok with \"punishing\" her partner but when the situation turned in his favour suddenly she is up in arms saying it is punishment and unfair.\n\nShe is a hypocrite, and the comment about the \"lack of adaptability\" is an attempt to shame him into doing what she wants, she is manipulative. She is upset/hostile because she dosen't have a leg to stand on in this argument and she knows it.", "The only hole here is the AH gf.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing weird about it, some people are just selfish.", "I\u2019d be with you on this if she **on her own** suggested paying more (50%) on her own. \n\nThe fact that she wants to keep it as-is, and 50/50 is a begrudging concession when OP suggested she hold to her proposal\u2026.", "She's not the IRS either, but has been \"auditing\" how much he makes, and in fact it was her suggestion to begin with, so I don't think it's really a point against the OP.", "If 50/50 was discussed *as a starting point* and that they needed time to adapt to the new financial reality: sure, that's fine.\n\nHowever, the fact the GF wanted to keep the 35/65 split in favor of her - despite now making more money - and 50/50 was the *compromise* shows exactly where her priorities are.\n\nFinances are a major part of a relationship. While extreme, it's also completely valid to reevaluate his future with GF given the whole, \"We do it if it benefits me, but we don't if it benefits you\" stance would likely extend beyond finances.", "Screw this bullshit about her being shocked and needing time to adjust,  and that somehow now breaking the set agreement (where OP was being leaned on financially previously) just because SHE may be leaned on now to a static 50/50 isn't a problem \n\n\"Understand her side\" \n\nI understand she paid proportionally less before at HER request, and now wants to back out", "He says she has received a major promotion - so she has more money now.\n\nShe just found out, that she's no longer benefiting from the deal she has made."]}
