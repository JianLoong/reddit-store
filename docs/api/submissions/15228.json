Big marinara flags over here.", "If it was good enough for her when she had to pay less, then it still should be good now given that the idea was hers to begin with. It's completely unfair to change the agreement now that she's realizing *she's* expected to pay more.

You honored your deal & now it's her turn to put her money where her mouth is.", "Bye-bye gf. She's not the one.", "NTA. Sounds like it she wanted it to be proportional when it suited her only, and she sounds like a damn hypocrit if she wants to talk about your lack of adaptability. This is hugely indicative of how she values money over you.", "NTA, how ridiculous. Sit her down and ask her to justify it to your face. I would fall right out of love if she repeated that bullshit.

She's looking out for #1, I'd question if you want that in a relationship.", "NTA, you had an agreement and she broke it.  Your call how important it is for you to push it. \n\nI would be pretty mad about it though. And would definitely not just let it go. It's a pretty big red flag.", "NTA.  Ah yes, when it works for her it's a great idea.  When it works against her well, now not so great.\n\nShe is the only AH here.\n\nWhy would you keep it as is?

This woman doesn\u2019t want a partner she wants a sugar Dady. It was only fine for it to split by income when it benefits her? No. That\u2019s not ok. \n\nI would do some serious thinking about if you want to continue this relationship. Like what happened if you lost your job? Would you be homeless?", "Oh wow. NTA in the slightest. This is incredibly selfish behaviour on her part. The audacity of her, expecting to earn more than you but still contribute far less when the agreement was splitting proportionally! Not sure this attitude is something I could get past, personally.", "NTA\n\nSo she was okay with paying bills proportiomally to income when you earned more, but not not okay with it when she earns more?

Why does she thinks if it's ops money she is entitled but he isn't entitled to hers. If you guys were married that would be your money but atm take no risks. Talk to her explain how you feel about her double standards.Tell her if she wants to be a hypocrite you'll dump her. Their are plenty of fish in the sea. She's manipulative and this can soon turn into emotionally abuse.", "Info needed\n\n\nWhat happened with your job? Why is she mad?? Cause that adaptability comment is super weird. Did something change?? Did you give her a hard time over not earning as much as you? Did you complain about paying more? Or sat that to her??\n\nJust really weird comment....

Realistically she might be a bit off put at having to so drastically change her expenses / go from paying 35% to 65%, which is essentially a reversal. This might take time and be a bit of a shock as it\u2019s not what she\u2019s used to. \n\nIdk her so obviously I can\u2019t really speak on her character or yours, but at least she\u2019s willing to go 50/50 rn, if she wasn\u2019t I\u2019d be a bit more concerned.", "NTA... still, you could have waited a little longer to bring this over, just to be nice to her, like let her have her first paycheck for herself. At any rate, this shouldn't be an issue. So if you two argue over this, maybe you aren't meant for each other. Footing her fair share of the bills should be more natural and come from herself.
