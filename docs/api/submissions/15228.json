She needed to live in a more expensive area and commute for work; I was in subsidised housing.

There are a few reasons why:\r  \n\r  \nYou have consistently and fairly split finances proportional to your incomes since moving in together 3 years ago. This approach was proposed by your girlfriend originally because she felt it was equitable. You are simply hoping to continue that precedent.\r  \n\r  \nYour incomes have changed, but you want to re-evaluate the proportional split to ensure it remains fair to your current means, rather than flip it completely to 50/50. A proportional split avoids imbalance and resentment. 50/50 could become unfair if incomes change again in the future.\r  \n\r  \nYou have tried to have a reasonable, open discussion about this with your girlfriend to express why the proportional approach continues to make sense to you. You want to feel heard and for your perspective to be validated as well.\r  \n\r  \nYou do not begrudge your girlfriend's success and increased earning potential. You want to find a compromise that accounts for that while also ensuring the split remains fair and balanced overall based on abilities to contribute.\r  \n\r  \nYou have contributed equally to household responsibilities, chores and finances based on your shared agreement. You feel that should continue now that incomes have adjusted rather than flip the script entirely.\r  \n\r  \nYou expressed a willingness to re-evaluate the proportional split to make adjustments as needed and find a \"50/50-ish\" compromise. You are not being unreasonable or unwilling to meet in the middle.\r  \n\r  \nYour girlfriend has not presented a reasonable, balanced perspective on why the 50/50 split is clearly fairer and more equitable. Only that she does not want to \"punish herself\" for her success.\r  \n\r  \nIn summary, you have approached this sensitive financial situation with your partner fairly, reasonably, and openly. You are willing to compromise where appropriate. The asshole behavior and stubbornness seem to be coming from your girlfriend's end based on the information provided. I hope this helps provide some perspective!

Now that the equity has changed the split needs to reflect that.  It's utterly unreasonable for you to keep paying the majority of the bills when you're earning less than your GF.  It reflects extremely poorly on her that she's not willing to do the same.  Had she simply had the raise and you kept the same pay a 50/50 split might have been warranted on the basis that she's moved into a different income bracket and you both earn enough to not have to worry about having funds outside of your shared living expenses e.g. you both make large enough salaries that even though one makes more it's not any burden to simply pay half.
