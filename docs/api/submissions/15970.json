In a few days its our (25m) birthday. We share the same friend group and we\u2019re all really close and have been since school. He has a close group of girl friends (about 5 of them) who I have also known for many years, I would class them as being closer with him in recent years but we are all still good friends and socialise often together. \n\nNow, I have been added to a group chat labeled \u201c*my brothers name* surprise dinner!\u201d It is a surprise birthday dinner for my twin brother organised by one of the girls in that group and they have invited me as a guest. One of them also said in the group that it would \u201cbe nice to see me as well\u201d so I just feel like an afterthought. I wouldn\u2019t really have minded if the girls wanted to organise a surprise birthday evening exclusively for my brother and themselves but they have also invited my partner and some of my brother and I\u2019s closest friends.\n\nThis feels inconsiderate and quite upsetting as I can\u2019t understand why I would be invited to my literal twin brothers surprise birthday dinner with me only invited as a guest as it is also my birthday involving all of our friends. My girlfriend also found this action to be extremely rude and wondered why this girl didn\u2019t just reach out to her and then they could have organised a surprise involving both of us instead or have just involved both my brother and I and left the surprise element out of it. \n\nIn the chat it is clearly stated that we are all to arrive at one time while my brother is due to arrive 20 minutes later. The thought of attending makes me feel weird because it\u2019s just a celebration for \u201chis\u201d birthday when him and I are literally born on the same day. This isn\u2019t new information to the organiser. Also, every year my brother and I do something together because we want to and because we have the same friends, last year our friends and my girlfriend set up a massive dinner for our birthday to which everyone was invited, including the girl group. \n\nSo now I\u2019m at a crossroads. I don\u2019t know whether or not to attend. On one hand, if I don\u2019t go I will feel left out because our mutual friends are going. But on the other hand if I do go, I will feel like I am letting myself be disrespected and I will likely feel uncomfortable as it feels like only my brother is being celebrated.\n\nSo, WIBTA if I took a stand and didn\u2019t go?", "created_utc": 1682771531, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/132rpi2/wibta_for_not_attending_my_twin_brothers_surprise/", "score": 424, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your friends may be assuming you are included in the birthday celebration without you specifically being named. Sometimes over time can be easy to see twins as a unit instead of individuals.

Maybe he'll feel your absence, maybe not. After 24 shared twin birthdays, let him have one that treats him as an individual.", "This is just odd. I agree with another commenter that having your girlfriend talk to the organizers might work best especially since you think your brother, as the guest of honor, will be uncomfortable and upset by them excluding you.", "NTA. Omg I had something like this happen to me before and it was so awkward and horrible.\n\nI had a friend who had the same birthday as me in a fairly tight knit friend group. We\u2019d actually had all gone out and celebrated the dual birthday before so this was not a surprise to people. We joked about being birthday twins every so often.\n\nAnd the time I lived in one town and worked in another, and would go to the gym in that town after work. Most that friend group lived in the gym/work town. Both were close so it\u2019s not like a long drive to hang out. On my birthday at the gym I ran into a couple in the group. They said \u2018hey we\u2019re all going out to dinner for Friends birthday, I should join!\u2019 I thought it was odd but thought maybe it was a last minute thing Friends GF arranged, or maybe it was a surprise for me arranged by my BF since these friends and I had slightly different schedule and never saw each other at the gym. I was so wrong.\n\nWe show up and it\u2019s all out tight knit friend group, everyone has brought a gift. I kept thinking this is weird someone is going to say something right? When it came time to cut the cake, it was supposed to be the person with the next birthday that does the cutting and serving. I just kept my head down and tried to squeeze out of the area to use the restroom and avoid the convo. Ppl were like oh it\u2019s so and so right? No I think it\u2019s so and so? And my BF at the time - great guy, social idiot - said no it\u2019s Sicily. The birthday boy looked at me and his face immediately fell and then a couple other people realized. Someone who was newer to the group who joined the dinner later was like when\u2019s your birthday? You could have heard a pin drop when I said today. Literally everyone forgot. The rest of the dinner was so awkward for everyone now, not just me and it lead eventually to me no longer hanging out w that group", "Nta. They don\u2019t like you and do not respect you.

Also could just be an ass.", "Is it possible this is how they are going to surprise you also?\n\nJust a thought.", "I'm not going to be popular here, but YTA. This is entitlement and it's pretty common for twins to not want to share things all the time. Maybe he made a comment about having to share celebrations and really wanted one for himself like non twins. Idk, why should their brother be forced to share a bday party? Just have two! Especially with the comment about a girl organizing reeks of jealousy.", "NTA. Is there a chance it is a joint party but only a surprise for your brother?

Sorry, but that's pretty screwed up.", "Just go. All your friends will be at the party. After its all done and said. Tell your brother how you felt disrespected. They could be surprising you as well by letting you think itnwas just for him. So before you make a issue out of it. See how it plays out.

Like, don't even consider it. They're clearly more his friends at this point, and they clearly don't care how you feel about it. \n\nI'm more sassy about shit like this, if i were you I would've said something the moment they added me, then left the group.

I can't imagine you're brother would be happy about this either.. It's insulting and puts your brother in an uncomfortable place. Maybe ask your brother to do something with you on this day? Since he doesn't know about the surprise dinner and kibosh their plans? Or talk to the organizer and tell them it's uncomfortable for you and will be for your brother as well..

I still feel bad about it til this day. It\u2019s like they totally ignored/forgot the fact that it was my sisters birthday too. It made me feel so uncomfortable and bad for my sister.

If they planned this the next day or next weekend it would be perfectly fine. Just not on the day of their actual birthday!\n\nMy sister, me and one of our cousins have birthdays within the same ten days.

But your GF should definitely have a \"chat\" with the other girl.  Gotta admit that my favorite suggestion on here is to set up a bday dinner elsewhere with your brother that starts shortly before the party.", "My thought is also that one of the girls is into OP's brother", "But this just emphasises the shittiness of surprise parties - especially the ones planned to make the person think they've been forgotten. No matter how good the party, it won't make up for him feeling confused, unwanted and unhappy beforehand.", "I was thinking the same thing", "If that\u2019s the case \u2014 play stupid games, win stupid prizes.  No one wants to feel left out on their bday", "It was natural distance but they can be a bit problematic at times causing unnecessary dramas etc, so myself and my friends just distanced ourselves a little bit but my brother remained quite close even so which is fine", "I got the same impression. Especially since the one said, \"It would be nice to see you, too.\" Which implies they don't see him as often.", "Yeah this, and then discuss with your brother later (so as to not ruin the surprise because then you would be TA) about this whole not being included thing. Good luck op, you're NTA either way but it's definitely a tough situation to be in.", "I know my brother is innocent, it\u2019s got nothing to do with him he isn\u2019t even aware this is happening but I know when he finds out he will be upset about it too. This is a very unusual situation to be in. The dinner falls the night before our actual birthday. Thank you for your advice!", "I thought this too. Maybe they do have something planned for OP? You should go and see how it is. At least wish a happy bday to your brother, stay for a bit and then leave if you aren\u2019t vibing with the whole thing. \n\nBut NTA. This IS kinda weird of friends either way.", "I had this thought as well...also wondering if maybe the organizer has a thing for the brother and is trying to show him she likes him more?", "I feel like this has to be it but, like...bad execution.", "I think it would be humiliating. Happy birthday his brother,oh yeah,happy birthday to you as well. Don't go.", "I agree with this.  I understand you feel slighted, as you absolutely should.  But this party is to celebrate your brother so go into it like you would any other individual celebration (engagement or graduation etc). In the long run this will reflect poorly on those planning and snubbing you - unless there is some kind of (not really tasteful now) surprise planned for you. Don't punish your brother because his friends are obtuse and hurtful.  I'm actually curious to see how he reacts.", "Absolutely not! You should never set yourself on fire to keep others warm and this is a Grade A example. \n\nOP is entitled to feel hurt and being a supreme doormat won\u2019t help. If he goes, OP will either be blamed if / when things get awkward when twin realises that his brother is being left out and / or a hastily thrown together do-over celebration will be held for OP that will be as humiliating as the first event. \n\nThis is just hideous advice.", "I don\u2019t mean to come off entitled, I\u2019m just a bit thrown and confused.

They are all our friends from high school except for the organiser. It is happening the night before our birthday.", "They have the same friends group. It says so, in detail, right in the post.", "But it\u2019s not a separate friend group. It\u2019s a few people who may be more friends with the brother, but they are inviting OP, brother, and many of OP and brother\u2019s mutual friends. If this was a separate thing, then fine. But they have invited Op, his girlfriend, and the mutual friend group so it\u2019s not really separate any more.", "I am close to these people, just not so much the organiser.

I can\u2019t make it since it\u2019s my birthday as well and I was looking forward to celebrate it.", "That would be a cruel prank in my opinion", "Yes! This is what I was thinking. Both think it's only for the other. However, the fact that OP's partner wasn't consulted in the planning indicates otherwise. Unless, of course, she's pretending.", "That would certainly be a twist, but realistically it would just be insulting both twins", "I was thinking the same thing, or at least, I'm hoping it's the situation. It seems weird that this friend group is intentionally only celebrating one twin, considering how close they are.", "That would still be an enormous dick move. People who don't know how to organize surprise parties without being dicks should not organize surprise parties at all.", "As a twin I'd assume the party was for both of us. Id feel like an ass if I realized afterwards it wasn't. I dont think op would be the ass if they revealed it to the twin.", "You do realize that surprise parties aren't sacrosanct?  Especially if it makes the birthday boy uncomfortable that his own twin is there on sufferance as a guest. It's just plain weird. \n\n OP and his twin are used to hosting their own party, of course they should discuss their plans and anything that might affect it. Maybe the brother wants to host their own party at the same time and invite the girls.", "So you think is a better bday gift for someone to find out their twin they are incredibly close to, not only is not there but is hurt by being excluded? I would leave the party if I were his brother and get mad at everyone who thought this was a good idea and went along with it, and at my sibling for not telling me.", "Yeah I don\u2019t agree with everyone saying to tell his brother or make plans with him that coincide with the surprise party. Just plan something earlier or another day and do something that night with the gf.", "Respond politely telling them you already have birthday plans.", "Are you? My mom planned a joint surprise for me and my dad one year. We both knew the party was for the other person. We were both super surprised that it was for both of us. We had no idea. It was awesome.", "How are you certain?", "Is this girl interested in your brother romantically? Maybe this is her way of getting in with him?", "I'll say they cause unnecessary drama!!! Understatement of the year. \n\nNTA", "Do you have plans with your brother? If not, it might be that you need to talk to your brother about this situation and what you both want out of your relationship.", "So this is on brand for them is what you\u2019re saying. The unnecessary drama.", "here they go again causing unnecessary drama. just say you can\u2019t go and then discuss with your brother after if there\u2019s something he hasn\u2019t told you, like if he secretly doesn\u2019t like sharing a bday. explain you didn\u2019t want to ruin the surprise and that\u2019s why you didn\u2019t bring it up earlier. at the end of the day, your feelings are most likely way more of a priority to him than these friends are. don\u2019t be afraid to approach him calmly and try to get to the bottom of this", "This 100% does not matter. I am friends with a set of twins, but WAY closet to one than the other. Every year we do a joint bday for both and a friend and I make 2 separate cakes (each gets their fave). It\u2019s just cruel to invite someone to what should be their birthday party.", "If it's not the actual birthday then I'd say don't bother going. Say you have plans with your gf. And have the usual party with your brother the next day", "I had a similar situation in a friend group. we would all go out to celebrate each others' birthdays.  One friend and I have the same birthday. When our birthday came around, only a dinner for the friend was organized while I was only invited as a guest. I was so offended. This situation plus many others made me drop that group. I realized they were never my friends.", "Why have the mutual friends who were invited not pushed back?\n\nIf I were your girlfriend, I\u2019d make a separate chat to talk to the other invitees, make it very clear to them that the organizer is deliberately snubbing you, and ask them to please be part of the solution.", "OP wouldn't be punishing his twin by not attending the surprise party. They can do something together earlier in the day and just explain that OP has made plans with their partner for the time the surprise party is.\n\nOP should most definitely explain what happened and how they felt with twin afterwards however.", "Right. If OP and the twin are super close I would anticipate they loop in OP or maybe even say something to the hosts for leaving OP out.", "Awful advice. Anything thrown together for OP afterwards will reek of insincerity and resentment. \n\nOP deserves to be treated well and that includes by himself.", "Who said anything about setting yourself on fire? When did I say they werent entitled to their feelings? Or to be a doormats? \n\nOP can go, be supportive of his brother\u2019s party, and have a little faith that their mutual friends will be happy OP is there too and spread the goodwill and cheer. \n\nHow would OP be blamed when their sibling realized? OP was invited to the party by the organizer.", "Totally understandable and you\u2019re still NTA.  But the entitlement is from your wanting to celebrate your birthday at the same time he\u2019s celebrating his.  You two are different people and he\u2019s allowed to have his own party if that\u2019s what he wants.", "Is your brother single? Because I have a feeling this organiser has a crush on him or at least trying to set him up, while you, on the other hand, are already \"provided for\". Still ah move.", "It also says that brother has 5 close girlfriends that he would classify as brother\u2019s friends who are throwing this for him.", "Maybe it's for the both of you and she being vague about it so you don't find out", "I think it's just because you're so used to you and your brother being treated as a unit, at least when it comes to birthdays, that this feels strange to you, but I think it's something that's going to happen more and more often as you all age.", "Out of curiosity - are you identical twins? Doesnt really matter for judgment but from a optics standpoint it would look incredibly awkward, almost funny even, to sing happy birthday to one of you and not the other.", "[deleted]", "*\u201dSo the same thing happened to me except it wasnt the same, anyway youre an AH\u201d*", "So twins can\u2019t have their own identify and have to do everything together? The person throwing it is friends with the brother, the other people invited are mutual friends (which makes sense to invite your brothers friends to his party).", "That\u2019s still really mean. It\u2019s not ok to make someone feel like shit for multiple days so that *you* can have fun \u201csurprising\u201d them.", "Precisely!", "I have heard some spectacularly bad ways of keeping a surprise party secret from the recipient but I think this one would win hands hand.", "I'd absolutely hate that. Because that means they must have decided that it was a good idea to make me feel awful for days before my birthday, and wonder how many of my friends are really my friends etc... So, when the big reveal happened I'd more than likely storm out instead of reacting well.", "it might be a shame, but i suppose at the end of the day it's just a party. the coordonators will learn that despite meaning well they ended up hurting people, and so theyll refine their technique if they want to continue hosting surprises.", "Honestly, if they are doing that, it's still stupid and mean to let each brother think that they have been forgotten and overlooked in favour of the other, and that is the kind of sh*tty surprise that deserves to be spoiled.", "The surprise will ruin the birthday for both twins.", "Literally it was a giant yell \u201chey everyone I forgot bc I\u2019m a terrible friend but it\u2019s also ravynwave\u2019s birthday today!\u201d The other people were the other girl\u2019s friends so they wouldn\u2019t have known. Man did I want the floor to swallow me.", "The detail that is not mentioned in the post, party day is not their actual birthday. I think that makes it fine either way.", "Is a surprise party a cruel prank?", "I don't think that's the case, but if it was, she should break the surprise now bec8she can see he's upset.", "Right, how could she tell him she is in on it? Like that's part of surprising people.", "How?", "I\u2019m a twin as well and if I saw mine as a guest at a birthday party just for me, I would feel awkward as hell.", "I mean if it was my twin and our friends had excuses them or me I'd want to know personally. Do you have a twin your close with? I wouldn't do that shit to mine.", "Then invite your brother to your birthday celebration, make it about both of you instead of just one, invite close friends and family who aren\u2019t part of the \u201csurprise birthday party\u201d, and don\u2019t tell the idiots who planned a birthday party for a one twin while not seeing the issue with ignoring the other twin. \n\nNTA", "If so, she couldn't go about it in a worse way. I sure as hell wouldn't remain friend with anyone who thought they had a right to exclude my twin from something as major as our birthday,  let alone have any kind of romantic relationship with that person. Absolutely not.", "My brother and I see each other almost everyday as we are in business together, he is completely unaware this is going on so he\u2019s not at fault, I know he will be upset if he knew I wasn\u2019t included", "They said the party is being thrown by someone who the brother met and formed friendships with and while that person was invited to their last joint birthday, and OP consemiders them a mutual friend, that person likely only thinks of them as an acquaintance and may just be clueless and not really thinking about them being twins.", "This is the way.", "She did message one of our mutual friends who was completely shocked and angry as she didn\u2019t realise it was only a surprise for my brother. She is still planning on going but says that if we don\u2019t go and people question it she will call them out", "He isn\u2019t aware of it and we both didn\u2019t want to do anything for our birthday this year", "Don\u2019t tell your brother and be 20 minutes early, definitely sounds like it.", "It\u2019s more the fact that this is a complete surprise for my brother and not for me, yet I\u2019m invited as a guest so it just doesn\u2019t really make sense to me. I would be fine if we did something separate but this just feels awkward", "We\u2019re identical lol", "But the day is\u2026 kind of about him. These arent two people who happen to share a birthday. They\u2019re twins who are super close who have celebrated 24 other birthdays together.", "Them having their own identity isnt the issue - if OPs sibling asked to have their own party, then we\u2019d be talking about that.", "I'm not saying it's okay.\n\nI'm just wondering if it's a possibility.", "But to what end? Then they're both only half-surprised. It's confusing and unnecessarily complicated. Anyone who would do something like this knowing the near total overlap in friend groups is an idiot. Very high likelihood of the \"surprise\" being spoiled.", "I do love this level of petty. \ud83d\ude02 Organise a twin dinner for just the two of you (plus girlfriend if you want) and have him come to that instead. \ud83d\ude02", "Totally agreed. *If you wanna be my lover you gotta get with my \u2026twin?*", "I would say just reach out to the organiser and say you won't attend because you'll be celebrating your birthday. If you go and it's obvious they're there for your twin, then who's celebrating you? I doubt your twin would be upset you weren't there since you said you're close so just don't feel obliged to go if you don't want to. Yes it would be nice to support your twin but you need to be supported too I think, make plans with your partner instead", "I meant why don't you two already have plans together for your birthday? \n\nHonestly, I'd just let this play out. See how everything shakes out. You and your brother talk about it after.", "Let him be upset with the events. This will get him to see the girls for who they are.\n\nAlso NTA - you wouldn\u2019t do this for two non siblings who had the same birthday, so you certainly wouldn\u2019t do it for twins.", "I met twin 1 in college and saw him 1-2 times a week during college, 10 years later I still see him about once a week. Twin 2 I also met in college and saw him maybe once a month, now I see him a couple times a year. \n\nI would still never exclude him from his own birthday party because that\u2019s a shitty thing to do even if this guy is a total stranger. If you know someone is a twin, you have to offer to celebrate both if you invite both", "Don\u2019t worry about it. There\u2019s not a shred of entitlement in your post. I\u2019m not sure what this person is talking about. You laid out the facts in a very rational and factual way. I\u2019d be really hurt by this. Maybe your partner should say something to the organizer?", "If you both communicated to each other that you both didn\u2019t want to do anything this year, then my comment about having a sense of entitlement is moot.", "I guess your description makes it sound like this is a separate birthday party just for your brother so that's why it's only a surprise for him.", "Eh you sound really spoiled right now to be honest. You said the person hosting it is a close friend to your brother, not to you- why would she throw you a surprise birthday party? It makes sense why she would invite your other friends if they are his friends too.", "Then you definitely need to go - maybe show up a SMIDGE late (but before your brother) so people think youre him and say surprise.", "[deleted]", "For all we know twin complained to this friend that they feel like they want to do something for themselves on their birthday. It\u2019s also weird to plan a surprise party for someone you aren\u2019t close to simply because they share their birthday with someone else. It would be different if the host was one of their close mutual friends, but she isn\u2019t.", "We both talked about how we didn\u2019t want to do anything for our birthday this year", "And when is OP supposed to have a birthday party, especially if they have the same friends?", "We dont know their perspective or intentions for doing this.  \n\nNot quite as analogous but its almost like throwing an anniversary party for just one person in a couple and not the other. This person is being tacky and rude.", "You're sure that's the case and he isn't letting you down easy because he would like to do something with other people? If you two really don't want to do anything for your birthday, why are you focused on being offended you weren't one of the guests of honor instead of talking about how you tried to tell a bunch of people your brother didn't want a party either? \n\nLook, I just think you need to let this play out and talk about things with your brother after.", "A different day. Or plan his own. He even said he's not close to the organizer and I'm not sure how close he is to these other friends since none of them said \"hey why don't you make it a joint party\". Should everyone be expected to always throw a joint party? Should the organizer not invite him at all since it's not a joint party? Wouldn't that have been even worse to say I'm throwing your brother a party but I'm not inviting you? Or even sadly maybe he doesn't have a birthday party this year because he doesn't seem to have friends that are close enough to him to have planned a party or step up for him to be a part of this party.\n\nMaybe he organizes a night out with his friends instead of a party. There are options other than boycotting his brother's party because it's not for him as well. Edited", "[deleted]", "OP has no idea why they were excluded from this, which is why theyre here so no - we do not know the organizers perspective and neither does OP. \n\nAlso maybe they didnt make plans because OP knows their brother has a surprise party to attend?"]}
