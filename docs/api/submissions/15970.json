In a few days its our (25m) birthday. We share the same friend group and we\u2019re all really close and have been since school. He has a close group of girl friends (about 5 of them) who I have also known for many years, I would class them as being closer with him in recent years but we are all still good friends and socialise often together. \n\nNow, I have been added to a group chat labeled \u201c*my brothers name* surprise dinner!\u201d It is a surprise birthday dinner for my twin brother organised by one of the girls in that group and they have invited me as a guest. One of them also said in the group that it would \u201cbe nice to see me as well\u201d so I just feel like an afterthought. I wouldn\u2019t really have minded if the girls wanted to organise a surprise birthday evening exclusively for my brother and themselves but they have also invited my partner and some of my brother and I\u2019s closest friends.\n\nThis feels inconsiderate and quite upsetting as I can\u2019t understand why I would be invited to my literal twin brothers surprise birthday dinner with me only invited as a guest as it is also my birthday involving all of our friends. My girlfriend also found this action to be extremely rude and wondered why this girl didn\u2019t just reach out to her and then they could have organised a surprise involving both of us instead or have just involved both my brother and I and left the surprise element out of it. \n\nIn the chat it is clearly stated that we are all to arrive at one time while my brother is due to arrive 20 minutes later. The thought of attending makes me feel weird because it\u2019s just a celebration for \u201chis\u201d birthday when him and I are literally born on the same day. This isn\u2019t new information to the organiser. Also, every year my brother and I do something together because we want to and because we have the same friends, last year our friends and my girlfriend set up a massive dinner for our birthday to which everyone was invited, including the girl group. \n\nSo now I\u2019m at a crossroads. I don\u2019t know whether or not to attend. On one hand, if I don\u2019t go I will feel left out because our mutual friends are going. But on the other hand if I do go, I will feel like I am letting myself be disrespected and I will likely feel uncomfortable as it feels like only my brother is being celebrated.\n\nSo, WIBTA if I took a stand and didn\u2019t go?\n\nEDIT: my girlfriend has just checked the chat and the organiser has booked the dinner for 10 people and a set menu. There are currently 11 attending excluding my girlfriend and I. If we went, this would make it way over capacity. Now we *really* aren\u2019t sure if we should go because what if we turn up and there is no room? This makes it slightly more awkward as we may not be able to just pull up a chair and join? The dinner is tomorrow also. \n\nThanks for all the kind messages as well, I will definitely give an update after everything plays out", "created_utc": 1682771531, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/132rpi2/wibta_for_not_attending_my_twin_brothers_surprise/", "score": 3692, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The only thing that maybe makes sense is that it's a double surprise and they've told your brother it's for you.

When he ask why you were late others had decided to celebrate his birthday but you wanted to spend time with him.  Either the AH girls will make it painfully obvious to everyone she excluded you or all will celebrate you as well as your twin. Your friends may be assuming you are included in the birthday celebration without you specifically being named. Sometimes over time can be easy to see twins as a unit instead of individuals.  It is not right but to someone not planning the party it can be an easy assumption to make. This is a way to see who is your true friends.

How do you know they don\u2019t have something planned for you, especially since your friends are invited? Is it weird? Yes. Is it tacky and thoughtless not to consider you? Very, but obviously they are his friends and not yours. Either way, love and celebrate your brother. You don\u2019t say if this event falls on your actual birthday. If so, it\u2019s your day as well as his. You can leave and celebrate YOUR birthday with your girlfriend and do something later with your brother. He is innocent in all of this.", "NAH- Have you ever considered that your twin doesn\u2019t like sharing birthdays and has expressed that to your friend group so they want to throw him a party of his own?

I made a fuss about it - both at \u201closing\u201d my own Saturday birthday (you only get one every 7 years!) and having to spend it celebrating someone else.

This is about the one girl trying to impress your brother.", "NTA. Since you and your twin are identical, here\u2019s what you do. Talk to your brother and tell him about the party.

Do something with your brother in the morning, and then say that you'll meet up later but ditch it instead.\n\nDon't explain yourself. Make the girls explain why they made a surprise for only him.

NTA but also I would go because what if they wanted to celebrate you as well but because they\u2019re not as close to you saying it\u2019s for him was the only way to get you there in their minds.

If you just not show up, your brother will be blindsided and the friend can flip the nareative any way she wants. \n\nI would call out the girl in the group chat and tell her you and your brother are really close and celebrate together every year. How it was really inconsiderate to invite you as a guest, especially involving your mutual friends and SO, and for that reason, you will not attend. \n\nI would also plan something with the twin during the day, before the dinner, maybe involve partners and a few close friends and leave out the girl group.

She\u2019s one of my best friends. But she\u2019s also married to my twin, there was nothing malicious about it.

Sorry, you are a victim of an adult mean girls situation here. Basically you\u2019ll either attend and possibly feel like an afterthought, or if you don\u2019t attend, be painted as an AH who didn\u2019t even go to his brother\u2019s birthday party. \n\nI like the advice of showing up a little later than your brother. Sounds like traffic is going to be a mess that day.", "INFO: You need someone behind the scenes to find out if this isn't a weird way to surprise you, too.

Send your regrets if you feel uncomfortable. Let their plan play out and see how it goes. Plan to see your brother earlier in the day. Let him have his surprise and party. Plan to celebrate your birthday as an individual, with your partner.\n\nYou guys can process later. Maybe he'll like having a birthday party where he isn't part of a unit, but THE guest of honor. Maybe he'll feel your absence, maybe not. After 24 shared twin birthdays, let him have one that treats him as an individual.", "This is just odd. I agree with another commenter that having your girlfriend talk to the organizers might work best especially since you think your brother, as the guest of honor, will be uncomfortable and upset by them excluding you.", "NTA. Omg I had something like this happen to me before and it was so awkward and horrible.\n\nI had a friend who had the same birthday as me in a fairly tight knit friend group. We\u2019d actually had all gone out and celebrated the dual birthday before so this was not a surprise to people. We joked about being birthday twins every so often.\n\nAnd the time I lived in one town and worked in another, and would go to the gym in that town after work. Most that friend group lived in the gym/work town. Both were close so it\u2019s not like a long drive to hang out. On my birthday at the gym I ran into a couple in the group. They said \u2018hey we\u2019re all going out to dinner for Friends birthday, I should join!\u2019 I thought it was odd but thought maybe it was a last minute thing Friends GF arranged, or maybe it was a surprise for me arranged by my BF since these friends and I had slightly different schedule and never saw each other at the gym. I was so wrong.\n\nWe show up and it\u2019s all out tight knit friend group, everyone has brought a gift. I kept thinking this is weird someone is going to say something right? When it came time to cut the cake, it was supposed to be the person with the next birthday that does the cutting and serving. I just kept my head down and tried to squeeze out of the area to use the restroom and avoid the convo. Ppl were like oh it\u2019s so and so right? No I think it\u2019s so and so? And my BF at the time - great guy, social idiot - said no it\u2019s Sicily. The birthday boy looked at me and his face immediately fell and then a couple other people realized. Someone who was newer to the group who joined the dinner later was like when\u2019s your birthday? You could have heard a pin drop when I said today. Literally everyone forgot. The rest of the dinner was so awkward for everyone now, not just me and it lead eventually to me no longer hanging out w that group", "Nta. They don\u2019t like you and do not respect you. They are inviting to appease your brother but not because they want you there. They know if they throw a surprise party fir him and you are not there it would raise so many questions.", "NTA \n\nThis girl has either a major thing for your brother or is jealous of your relationship with him. Also could just be an ass.", "Is it possible this is how they are going to surprise you also?\n\nJust a thought.", "I'm not going to be popular here, but YTA. This is entitlement and it's pretty common for twins to not want to share things all the time. Maybe he made a comment about having to share celebrations and really wanted one for himself like non twins. Idk, why should their brother be forced to share a bday party? Just have two! Especially with the comment about a girl organizing reeks of jealousy.", "NTA. Is there a chance it is a joint party but only a surprise for your brother? If not, there is a chance you aren\u2019t as close a friend to these people as you may think. Just too odd a scenario for there not to be a misconception here.", "Your friends sound like assholes.  Sorry, but that's pretty screwed up.", "Just go. All your friends will be at the party. After its all done and said. Tell your brother how you felt disrespected. They could be surprising you as well by letting you think itnwas just for him. So before you make a issue out of it. See how it plays out. Worse case scenario your brother if he's close like you said will have your back at that party once he realizes it.", "Has it not crossed anyone's mind that it's possibly a party for you both and he's invited to yours?", "NTA\n\nDon't go. Like, don't even consider it. They're clearly more his friends at this point, and they clearly don't care how you feel about it. \n\nI'm more sassy about shit like this, if i were you I would've said something the moment they added me, then left the group. Then I would plan something with my brother for that time.", "NTA\n\nSounds like she has the hots for your brother and wants to do something \u201cspecial\u201d for him. That\u2019s hella weird.

I can't imagine you're brother would be happy about this either.. It's insulting and puts your brother in an uncomfortable place. Maybe ask your brother to do something with you on this day? Since he doesn't know about the surprise dinner and kibosh their plans? Or talk to the organizer and tell them it's uncomfortable for you and will be for your brother as well..

I myself (28F) am also a twin (sister) and when I was in high school, my/our friend group through me a surprise birthday party at my house and also invited my sister as a guest. I still feel bad about it til this day. It\u2019s like they totally ignored/forgot the fact that it was my sisters birthday too. It made me feel so uncomfortable and bad for my sister. Looking back, I would not have been upset at all if my sister chose not to attend.", "NTA. Is it possible that the organiser has a crush on your brother and wants to show her feelings by organising the party for him only?", "This. Call them and say this to them live, not in a text.

If they planned this the next day or next weekend it would be perfectly fine. Just not on the day of their actual birthday!\n\nMy sister, me and one of our cousins have birthdays within the same ten days.

Talk to him after.

And maybe they have told your twin they are organizing a party for you and have asked him to attend and he is also stewing miserably about why he is not getting a party.", "This is the way. Eff those \u2018friends\u2019!!", "My girlfriend messaged one of our mutual friends and explained the situation and our mutual friend was gobsmacked, she didn\u2019t read the chat thoroughly and assumed it was a surprise party for both of us.

But your GF should definitely have a \"chat\" with the other girl.  Gotta admit that my favorite suggestion on here is to set up a bday dinner elsewhere with your brother that starts shortly before the party.", "My thought is also that one of the girls is into OP's brother", "But this just emphasises the shittiness of surprise parties - especially the ones planned to make the person think they've been forgotten. No matter how good the party, it won't make up for him feeling confused, unwanted and unhappy beforehand.", "I was thinking the same thing", "If that\u2019s the case \u2014 play stupid games, win stupid prizes.  No one wants to feel left out on their bday", "It was natural distance but they can be a bit problematic at times causing unnecessary dramas etc, so myself and my friends just distanced ourselves a little bit but my brother remained quite close even so which is fine", "I got the same impression. Especially since the one said, \"It would be nice to see you, too.\" Which implies they don't see him as often.", "Yeah this, and then discuss with your brother later (so as to not ruin the surprise because then you would be TA) about this whole not being included thing. Good luck op, you're NTA either way but it's definitely a tough situation to be in.", "I know my brother is innocent, it\u2019s got nothing to do with him he isn\u2019t even aware this is happening but I know when he finds out he will be upset about it too. This is a very unusual situation to be in. The dinner falls the night before our actual birthday. Thank you for your advice!", "I thought this too. Maybe they do have something planned for OP? You should go and see how it is. At least wish a happy bday to your brother, stay for a bit and then leave if you aren\u2019t vibing with the whole thing. \n\nBut NTA. This IS kinda weird of friends either way.", "I had this thought as well...also wondering if maybe the organizer has a thing for the brother and is trying to show him she likes him more?", "I feel like this has to be it but, like...bad execution.", "I think it would be humiliating. Happy birthday his brother,oh yeah,happy birthday to you as well. Don't go.", "I agree with this.  I understand you feel slighted, as you absolutely should.  But this party is to celebrate your brother so go into it like you would any other individual celebration (engagement or graduation etc). In the long run this will reflect poorly on those planning and snubbing you - unless there is some kind of (not really tasteful now) surprise planned for you. Don't punish your brother because his friends are obtuse and hurtful.  I'm actually curious to see how he reacts.", "Absolutely not! You should never set yourself on fire to keep others warm and this is a Grade A example. \n\nOP is entitled to feel hurt and being a supreme doormat won\u2019t help. If he goes, OP will either be blamed if / when things get awkward when twin realises that his brother is being left out and / or a hastily thrown together do-over celebration will be held for OP that will be as humiliating as the first event. \n\nThis is just hideous advice.", "I don\u2019t mean to come off entitled, I\u2019m just a bit thrown and confused. I would be equally upset if my brother was in the situation I am in and I am certain that when he finds out he won\u2019t be happy about it either", "They are my friends too. We have mutual friends. They are all our friends from high school except for the organiser. It is happening the night before our birthday.", "They have the same friends group. It says so, in detail, right in the post.", "But it\u2019s not a separate friend group. It\u2019s a few people who may be more friends with the brother, but they are inviting OP, brother, and many of OP and brother\u2019s mutual friends. If this was a separate thing, then fine. But they have invited Op, his girlfriend, and the mutual friend group so it\u2019s not really separate any more.", "I am close to these people, just not so much the organiser. Her and I are still good friends but she is closer to my brother. The problem is is that she has invited brothers and I\u2019s best friends. Which feels strange.", "I am aware of this.

One friend and I have the same birthday. When our birthday came around, only a dinner for the friend was organized while I was only invited as a guest. I was so offended. This situation plus many others made me drop that group. I realized they were never my friends.", "Why have the mutual friends who were invited not pushed back?\n\nIf I were your girlfriend, I\u2019d make a separate chat to talk to the other invitees, make it very clear to them that the organizer is deliberately snubbing you, and ask them to please be part of the solution.", "OP wouldn't be punishing his twin by not attending the surprise party. They can do something together earlier in the day and just explain that OP has made plans with their partner for the time the surprise party is.\n\nOP should most definitely explain what happened and how they felt with twin afterwards however.", "Right.

So what I'm really reading from this is that you are upset at the thought of attending an event that is not at least half about you. \n\nMotivations of the organizer would be interesting to know, and you could try to at least get the Intel after the fact as to whether this was some deliberate attempt to drive a wedge between you, but that really doesn't make a lot of sense, and honestly comes off paranoid. The organizer did nothing to prevent you from celebrating your own birthday on the actual date with your girlfriend, or celebrating the day with your twin together on the actual date. And they invited you to participate, so its not like they deliberately tried to keep you away from celebrating your brother. \n\nYou know your friends and you know your brother, so I encourage you to think about what this party is actually going to look like. Is it going to be a massive spectacle where your brother is treated like a king and you are ignored in the corner? Or is it going to be a fun group event where you can enjoy food and games and seeing your friends? If it's the second, and that sounds like fun to you, then the only thing stopping you from going is your own personal annoyance that your brother may be briefly more celebrated than you. \n\nWould it not be fun to you to surprise your twin brother with a party in general? Perhaps for a work promotion, graduation, or just because--any event that doesnt happen to also be your own birthday? Does he not like surprises? If you think he would enjoy that aspect (being thrown a surprise party) then why not be part of that for him for this?\n\nAnd think about your brother--you know him best so only you can answer this. Would he be upset that you did not attend? It can still be a party where both of you enjoy spending time with friends and being at a party--why does the fact that it is only a \"surprise\" to one of you make it any less an event that you both enjoy to attend? \n\nIdk, maybe I'm missing something. Any adult birthdays I've celebrated with friends have been low key events where we arrange dinners together, perhaps a particular activity (movie, mini golf, etc) and a cake/dessert everyone shares. Maybe presents, but anyone in your life who wants to get you a birthday present would surely still do so anyway? Like they don't need to wait for a planned party to hand it to you. \n\nSo this really sounds to me like \"I don't like the fact that my brothers friends organized a party I'm invited to where his \"gift\" is getting to be surprised by it and I will not be not explicitly celebrated the entire time.\"", "This is the strangest letter I've come across in a while. I don't understand why the friend would only have a party for your twin brother and not include you too but not as a guest?\n\nI would make plans to celebrate with my brother that night and screw up their party plans.\n\nNTA for sure, but those friends who organized the party are definitely AH's!\n\nHappy 25th birthday!", "This would be rude even if you were just friends who had their birthday on the same day. It's made 100x worse that you're twins. NTA", "As a twin myself I feel you need to separate yourself from your brother. He will have a different relationship with your friend group than you and that\u2019s good. \nEnjoy this event from your brother and look at doing something different to celebrate your birthday\nYou need to see yourself as an individual- not part of a duo", "INFO: Have you ever had a seperate celebration? \n\nI am wondering if there is a bit more at play here. Just theorizing as somebody who rarely got their own birthday growing up because my family is full of people that have birthdays in the same month, it is quite possible that your brother has mentioned to these friends that he would like to be the center of attention for once. I could easily see that more separate friend group running with it and deciding to throw him a party to give him what he said he wanted. Then again, it could just be that these people are a bunch of inconsiderate assholes and he would not want to take part in this himself either.\n\nCommunication is going to be key in this situation no matter what. People might get pissed off if you ruin the surprise and just ask him about it, but really at the end of the day your relationship with your brother is more important than your friend groups feelings on this matter. You're NTA for having valid feelings about this crappy situation.", "Look, someone is obviously being an asshole for not inviting you more properly, but this sub always seems to enjoy telling people to take the nuclear option whenever they\u2019re even slightly justified in being angry. This is your brother we\u2019re talking about. Laugh it off as someone being stupid and go and enjoy your brother\u2019s party. When he asks why the party isn\u2019t for you, too, just shrug and say who knows? Don\u2019t let him take it as a slight to not see you there, just go and celebrate and have a good time.", "NAH, Friends can have a party for a guy. They are closer to your Brother. They invited you. I get the idea that you feel they should have included you because .....you see it as being \"disrespected\" that these former friends didn't plan a Party for you? I think clearly the \"distance and small drama\" is more significant on their end then it is on yours.\n\nI also think with Twins you needing to be \"celebrated\" too by your brothers friends is a problem. You are turning 26 not 11 OP. You need to either say *yeah we are going to stay emotionally/socially conjoined or no we are not*. So Go to the freakin' party or don't and \"celebrate\" yourself on your own, but either way grow up a bit.", "NTA \n\nBut, I shared a birthday with my mother my entire life, not quite the same as a twin but probably close enough.  \n\nMy birthday was never about me, even as a child, it was always about her and any celebration of me felt like an after thought.\n\nI can understand your brothers friends wanting to celebrate him as a person without you.  They've separated you and your brother into 2 different people.\n\nAside from the twin aspect there's also brother rivalry, if you had birthdays on separate days you would probably have no issues taking turns celebrating on his day and then when your birthday came him celebrating you.\n\nThere is the smallest chance that this could also be coming from him, since it's his GF who's planning it, he may have commented that he wished he could have a birthday on his own.  \n\nSorry you're having a crappy birthday with drama this year.", "Has your brother agreed to this? It seems sus that he would agree to birthday plans that didn\u2019t include you. It also seems like at least one friend in the chat would realize they are creating a shitty situation.\n\nI feel there is something else going on here. Maybe they are trying to pull something over on both of you (as shitty as that is). It doesn\u2019t seem possible that every single one of your friends is this much of an a-hole.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s just me, but I would totally attend just for the reaction when someone at the dinner realizes what a mistake they\u2019ve made.\n\nNTA", "Show up or don't. Either way NTA. It's fine to be an afterthought, it's not a party for you it's for him. Not every thing has to be about the both of you, it's his friend group, again it's a party for him. There are two caveats to my opinion. One is that your brother would be hurt or offended by you not showing. I don't know his disposition or his opinion on things like this and if he would be hurt then yes, you probably should go. Two is if the only reason you aren't going is because they are making you an afterthought. If you aren't going because you are an afterthought and you don't want to ruin his party with your presence among his friends then cool. If you aren't going only because you feel burned that they don't want to throw you a party then soft Y.T.A. \n\nYou aren't the same person, you aren't joined at the hip, he can have his friends and you can have yours. They can have their celebrations and you can have yours. They wanted to throw their friend a party and thought not inviting you at all might be a worse slight. Basically get over it I guess, if you want a special party on your birthday thrown by friends get friends that will do that? Sorry to be harsh about it but you aren't entitled to everything your brother gets just because it's your birthday too. You're 25 not 12, again NTA but you need to consider that you're different people with different friends.", "YWBTA - you and your brother are separate and distinct people", "Just go. It is only ego preventing you from attending.", "YTA for thinking your brother can\u2019t ever have a celebration that isn\u2019t also about you? \n\nDon\u2019t you have friends if your own?", "I\u2019d go harder and really lay it thick. \n\n\u201cOh thank you for being so thoughtful about a party, but you might want to check brothers schedule as we already have plans. He and I will be celebrating the birthday that we share together! Sorry that you somehow missed the memo that we prefer to celebrate our birthday together, at the same time, with one party!\"", "This tell them you and your girlfriend have plans to celebrate your bday. Do something fun earlier in the day with brother then at night go somewhere nice to just celebrate yourself with gf. Nta", "NTA and I would tell them in chat \"guys sorry I can't go.  It's my birthday that day, and I'm going to make plans with my twin brother\".  Reminding them it's your bday as well and forcing them to figure out the surprise party situation lol", "It really sounds like this is their way of letting you know you\u2019re \u201cfriendship\u201d with them might be one-way. Sorry OP but it may be time to get new friends.", "Op clearly states those people are closer to the twin than op.  They just want to do something for their friend but op wants the same of everything.", "I\u2019d almost respond in the group chat \u201clet me get this straight. You want to invite me to a surprise birthday party on MY birthday as a guest? I just want to make sure I\u2019m reading this right.\u201d", "super sus, if this happened to me I would have immediatly been like 'wth, it's my bday too, are you mad at me'", "And wouldn't it make the brother feel weird, too? Hey, it's my birthday party! And there's my brother and it's his birthday too, but it's not his party?", "It's kind of obvious the girl throwing the party has a crush on OP's twin. Or she's playing wingman for a girl who does.", "Maybe OP's twin is single (and straight) so the girl group feels more comfortable throwing him a party, but have a weird hangup about throwing one for OP because he has a girlfriend", "Guarantee one of the girl group has a thing for OP\u2019s twin and is just thinking of landing her crush. OP has a girlfriend and is taken.", "A possible explanation would be that this was started by the group that are only friends with the twin, and then they began including people outside that circle, including OP.\n\n(Doesn't make it okay, but it explains it)", "My guess is that one of the women in the \"girl group,\" likes OPs brother and wants to do something special for OPs brothers...\n\nI mean, why can't one twin have a surprise party and not the other? Is OP 12?\n\nIt must be hard having to share everything all the time, and even if it isnt...then, sometimes it's probably nice to have things to yourself sometimes.", "Or maybe some of these childhood friends (but not adult friends of OP) *know* that OP's twin is sick and tired of always having to share *everything* with OP and think, just like singletons, OP's brother deserves his own separate party for once in his life?!? \n  \nWhy can't OP's brother just be happy that his brother has such good friends rather than run around screaming \"Me Me ME\" at the thought of his brother having his own fun? \n  \nJust because you shared a womb, doesn't mean you should be forced to share every single birthday celebration for the rest of your life.\n  \nAlso, OP not being included and just added as an afterthought shows that he's not as close to these friends as he wants to believe -- OP should go and find his own group of friends to throw him a party.", "100% the organizer has a crush on the brother and thinks planning something cute and special will endear her. OP best bet to blow up the crush is to not be there and let her dangle in the wind explaining why his twin isn't at their birthday.", "What I thought too, especially with the inviting 13 people but only reserving a table for 10 my thought was either the one planning it is an idiot and bad party planner, or they're into the brother", "She may be into him, but that makes her even more stupid, OP said somewhere that brother has a gf, and I'm assuming she would be invited so.... that's awkward.", "She must not be very bright or care to know much about him by planning a birthday party that excludes his twin brother, that he's quite close with.", "I'm surprised none of OP's friends did this when they were invited. I'd have at min pointed out that flaw in the celebration lmao.", "That is dreadful.", "But wouldn't the girlfriend be in on the surprise if that's the case? It sounds like she's not happy with the situation like OP. Seems like a backwards way of planning a surprise..", "I don\u2019t see how it\u2019s so hard for the friends to celebrate both brothers even if they are much closer to one of them. Making someone a guest to the birthday celebration of someone that they share a birthday with is pretty fucking hurtful. Either don\u2019t invite the OP at all or treat them like a package deal. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t throw an anniversary party for just one spouse and treat the other like a guest, for example.", "Agreed, I don't understand why people believe all twins must be treated the same way by everyone.  And for everyone telling OP to ruin the surprise as some sort of revenge - grow up. Unless they're still kids living at home and the parents are hosting the party, there's nothing wrong with each twin celebrating their own birthday.", "I agree. I said that on a different thread and got trashed. I know tons of twins. Some don't even like being ALWAYS celebrated together. It's not a milestone birthday, either. I don't see the giant scandal this post is making it out to be. I was called socially inept lmao. But the party isn't even on their actual birthday. I think OP is being really sensitive here. Couldn't he just be happy his brothers friends are throwing a party for him?", "That goes out the window when planning a birthday party for one twin.  It is the one day a year they should be celebrated as a pair.", "He said it was organized by \"one of the girls\" in the friend group. HELLO!

The twin will be the only one getting gifts, and cutting the cake etc. It puts OP in a really uncomfortable position.", "I like this idea", "Maybe this is just my cynical mind on overdrive, but I would record the call too.  If driving a wedge between twins is the goal, I wouldn\u2019t put it past these girls to escalate the situation further with lies about what went down on any such call.

I am the most independent person, me and my brother have completely different lives. But our birthday?? We shared a womb for 8 months and it's the same day EVERY YEAR. I once had a GF who was really pissy I wanted to go home and see my bro, so I stayed in our city with her and ended up crying and we broke up over it.

It\u2019s ok for you to honor your brother, even if you aren\u2019t getting recognized. It\u2019s shitty of them, but he had nothing to do with it. Let him have a moment by himself to shine. I promise you that if you do, it will come back to you for your moment. Also, as a side note, is it at all possible that they intend to surprise you as well, and this is the way they are getting you to the party?  Maybe they don\u2019t care for your girlfriend and that\u2019s why they didn\u2019t include her in the planning? Just a thought.

So, I'm sorry if this comes off as combative or rude or anything like that, but I have to be honest.  You've kind of put me between a rock and a hard place.

I love my brother, and I love the thought you guys put into this for him, but it doesn't sit right with me that I have to show up early to a surprise birthday for someone else on what is also my birthday.  I think I'm going to have to politely decline attending the party for that reason.

Apparently they were floored when I told them I was going with the students union exec and getting free drinks before at the bar.

They are for inviting OP and not informing the group properly it's a surprise party for 1 twin the group is friends with and not both of them.\n\nOP would also be TA if he did something to sabatoge the party, if he just doesn't show though and the party goes badly pincer the group shows up and realizes that's on the organizer (which IMHO is the only reason they included OP to begin with, the group that considered themselves friends with both brothers likely will not appreciate this any more that OP)", "Then you don't invite the twin to the surprise party.  If Brother A wants a birthday party about him why would you invite the other person he shares a birthday with?  Or you know, at least as the organizer you say that to the group so everyone doesn't think it's for both (like the one friends OP messages about it did think).\n\nAs it stands we have 0 reason to assume this is the what the organizer is doing, far more likely that she either likes Brother A and is trying to impress him or she just doesn't like Brother B", "This is the way", "I have spoken.", "This is the way", "This is the way"]}
