After my sister and the others got arrested they were offered arrangements. My sister's offer was that she would admit guilt, get 1 year in prison and then 1 year of probation and would have to pay back all the money she took. My sister didn't take the arrangement and she lost her court case. She got 6 years and 6 months in prison, 3 years and 6 months probation, she must pay back all the money she took and she must also pay a fine. She has been in prison for 5 months now.\n\nWhen my sister got arrested my parents were distraught. They paid for her bail. They let her live with them while she was on bail. They paid her legal bills for her court case. They paid her legal bills for her appeal. On the day they had to bring her to prison 5 months ago they were distraught. I was distraught when she was arrested too. I refused to believe it and thought it was a mistake. When I saw the proof I of what she did I was devastated. My parents write and receive letters from my sister. They talk to her on the phone as much as they can. They visit her as often as possible which is every other week and on all holidays. Ever since my sister went to prison all my parents talk about is how much my sister hates it in prison and how terrible prison is. They always pressure me to write and phone and visit her too because they are the only ones who do because we have no other family. Every time I see them they complain about how much my sister hates being in prison. I got annoyed and tired of it and I told them that prison is not meant to be a good time and she is there for a reason. Now they are furious at me and want me to say I was wrong. We have argued because I told the truth, I don't think I was wrong to say what I said but they do. Was I wrong for what I said to my parents about my sister? They are very angry with me right now.\n\n**This was not in my post but I am adding it now to explain that I'm not American even though almost everyone who is replying thinks I am for some reason.

Your parents are being enablers. Your sister took money from people during a pretty horrible time where folks are living paycheck yo paycheck. She is exactly where she needs yo be and the sooner she and your parents acknowledge this.

Ask them how they would feel is someone pulled one of her scams on them.\n\nTheir daughter made the choice to commit a crime and is responsible for why she ended up in prison.  She needs to take responsibility and they need to accept that.  No amount of complaining about how hard it is in prison is going to change the fact it will be like that for the duration of her sentence.   Prison isn't meant to feel like a holiday.

I have family that gave up their time to be with the state and it\u2019s because they did quite a bit and deserved it. Scamming people out of money is flat out wrong and if she did it to the degree that her case says, she deserves to take accountability. The people saying you\u2019re the asshole are the ones who think there\u2019s nothing wrong with their cousins or brothers robbing and stealing. Probably helped along the way too. Odds are if she\u2019s got good behavior she\u2019ll be out in half the time. \n\nStill, you aren\u2019t wrong and no, you aren\u2019t an asshole", "NTA.

Instead of lamenting her lost freedom she should be taking this opportunity to improve herself.", "YNTA maybe you should remind your parents about the hardship that she caused to the victims of her scams. How much retirement money she took from the elderly maybe someone needed medical care or child care expenses it could be a number of things, but the real victims are the ones paying the price.", "NTA\n\nPrison is meant to be punishment. It is supposed to be horrible so you don\u2019t want to go back. That is LITERALLY the point.", "NTA. What your sister did was horrible and your parents are more than likely part of her problem. Do they not even get what she has done? The worst thing is, is that the money she took will more than likely not go back to the victims. And good luck on having her pay it. Chances are your parents will have her a primary beneficiary for when they pass to help her. I hope you are there to notify the courts of any income she will receive so that some of the fees will be paid. \n\nNot sure if it is possible. Maybe talk to the prosecutor about them asking the victims how your sister\u2019s actions had affected their lives. Emotionally, financially\u2026 let your parents hear how this has devastated some. Maybe it will wake them up. \n\nOr call Dr Phil maybe he can wake them up", "NTA. I mean what do your parents think about what she did?

Your sister is an awful person and prison is where she belongs.", "NTA!!!\n\nIt's used as a deterrence.

My sister was also convicted of financial crimes after being a fugitive for awhile. I spoke to the detective myself and her court record is online but my parents are also delusional and can\u2019t believe it\u2019s true.

What your sister did was wrong and she earned her punishment.", "What your sister did was not exactly a victimless crime.  She tricked people and hurt them lying to them and stealing their money.  She was offered an arrangement, but turned it down, presumably thinking she could somehow weasel her way out of it.  She couldn't.\n\nShe is in prison because she did something very wrong, that hurt people, and if there's a sentence that long (unless you're in a country with draconian sentences) she must have bilked a lot of money from quite a few people.\n\nYour parents are in denial.  You aren't.  What you said was harsh but completely true.  Your parents are angry because what you said challenged their denial.\n\nNTA", "NTA at all. Plus most prisons have amenities that make it way less sucky than you would think. Tablets with games and their phone/video calls on it, movies, tv, you name it.
