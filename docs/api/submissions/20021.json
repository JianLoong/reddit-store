After my sister and the others got arrested they were offered arrangements. My sister's offer was that she would admit guilt, get 1 year in prison and then 1 year of probation and would have to pay back all the money she took. My sister didn't take the arrangement and she lost her court case.

She has been in prison for 5 months now.\n\nWhen my sister got arrested my parents were distraught. They paid for her bail. They let her live with them while she was on bail. They paid her legal bills for her court case. They paid her legal bills for her appeal. On the day they had to bring her to prison 5 months ago they were distraught. I was distraught when she was arrested too. I refused to believe it and thought it was a mistake. When I saw the proof I of what she did I was devastated.

If her parents had respected her boundaries in the first place, and stopped pushing we wouldn't have gotten this comment, as it seems that OP has done a decent enough job keeping her thoughts to herself up until now. Maybe not doing a good job of hiding her feelings, but she hasn't really been saying anything according to the post itself up until this incident.", "You\u2019re all good OP, you didn\u2019t know, you\u2019re  definitely NTA but prison systems in America need reform because we have a very unfair system that has deep roots in racism, injustice, really messed up sentencing laws here and that\u2019s barely the tip of iceberg.", "The US sends so many people to prison that they don\u2019t have enough room for everyone so they outsource the running of some prisons to private companies.  (There\u2019s even special \u201cfancy\u201d prisons for rich people) Judges in the US have been caught sending people to prisons run by private companies (not the government) in exchange for bribes.  So if a judge is getting money under the table for sending people to a certain prison, I certainly question if the judge is sending only the \u201cguilt\u201d people to prison.", "Private prisons. The federal government pays ridiculous amounts of money to private prisons to host their criminals. It\u2019s ridiculous, these are the same private prisons that are running the ICE immigrant concentration camps, and they charge us tax payers $700/DAY to keep a separated child there. Just for comparisson, you can rent a luxorious suite at the Hilton for $200 a night.\n\nIt\u2019s a scam from the party in power to give tax payer money to their campaign donors.", "You\u2019re welcome. I\u2019m happy to help.", "That\u2019s certainly a fair translation of the events as well! I can agree that\u2019s a likely scenario.", "People shouldn't assume that everyone is in the US when its not stated what country they are in though - if commentators are unsure they should ask for more information.", "Shit non Americans assume Americans for most everything too. And then criticize it.", "personally I hate that so much, like not everything in the world revolves around your country ffs. (not directed to you Pleasant Koala)", "agreed. this is a huge problem on the internet as a whole, not just this subreddit. everyone assumes the other person is in the US.", "It\u2019s an ancient concept. If you ever see a statue of Lady Justice she\u2019s blindfolded and holding a pair of scales. She is supposed to weigh what\u2019s right and wrong, but without seeing unimportant things like a persons color, or social status, etc.", "Thanks. Particularly because America isn\u2019t my country either!", "its because all these older internet forums originated in American and most of the original users were American. no one is saying that the world revolves around our country but the assumption isn't quite illogical.", "I always catch myself doing that. I think it\u2019s because the US already seems so impossibly big. I\u2019ve never been able to even leave the continental US. So the US is my whole world. (I do not mean this in a patriotic way)", "It\u2019s an assumption because Reddit loves to shit on America. So folks generally look for any opportunity to squeeze that in, assumptions be damned.", "obviously you are lying and there is nothing that could convince me you could be from a different English speaking country, Pleasant Koala", "I still think assuming everyone who speaks English on the Internet is automatically American or in the US is silly if they don\u2019t explicitly state differently. Just because the original users were American does not mean that\u2019s the case now in 2023. anyway I don\u2019t mean to argue, I was just stating an opinion as it\u2019s quite frustrating being on the receiving end of these assumptions. hope you have a good day", "i mean when it\u2019s not stated that\u2019s the easiest assumption to make especially when you\u2019re from that country. Op should\u2019ve stated it since it\u2019s so relevant. i understand being frustrated but clearly that\u2019s not anyones intent"]}
