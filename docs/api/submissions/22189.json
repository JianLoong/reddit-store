I\u2019m going into any specifics on how it happened but it did impact a lot of people. So much so that 60 + people showed up to his funeral. I didn\u2019t know most of these people as they were his work colleagues and I had never met any of them, but one of them I did know. \n\nFor many years my dad cheated on my mom with a nurse who worked at his hospital ( I\u2019m going to call her Susan). When I saw Susan there, in tears I was filled with so much rage. My older brother (29 M) told me \u201cnot to do anything\u201d cause it would \u201cbe a dishonour\u201d so I sat quietly and did nothing as she told everyone how much of a great man my father was.\n\nMy father was not a great dad in any sense. He would lie to all of his children, yell and throw things, and over all was not a good person. Yet here Susan was crying to everyone about how he was such a great man and how they would\u2019ve gotten married (they were never dating). This woman broke my parents marriage and basically proceeded to cause all my siblings, my mother, and myself to have therapy sessions. \n\nSo when she got up to the stage and spoke to a crowd full of people about how she would\u2019ve have been the perfect trophy wife to my father and how HE was finally going to live happily ever after, after so many years of being miserable I was over it. I told her that she had no right to speak about my father\u2019s life and how he so miserable because he and her made everyone else\u2019s life miserable. To which she responded that I and my siblings ( I have 7) were the reason my parents got a divorce not her. \n\nI called her demon spawn and told her I hoped she rotted in hell alongside my father to which point I was ushered out of the room by my two older brothers ( 25 M and 27 M). The day after I got hate messages calling me all sorts of names including my eldest brother who told me not to do anything.

I wish you and your family the best", "NTA, but remember that the person who\u2019s ultimately to blame here is your father. He\u2019s the one who made vows to your mother, and he\u2019s the one who was abusive towards you. The reason why you\u2019re in therapy is because of *his* disloyalty and disrespect towards your family. I bring this up because I think it\u2019s important to remember that Susan wasn\u2019t acting alone, and that the dissolution of the marriage wasn\u2019t something that your father passively allowed to happen. He made choices to initiate/ensure its demise.", "ESH. Damn, nobody could spend a couple of hours being civil? And let the fights resume in private? Not necessarily for fathers benefit, just more for family as whole?", "ESH\n\nAs a Balkan, I can tell you, it's not a funeral unless someone tries to kill someone else. People fight on funerals all the time here.\n\nSusan probably shouldn't have spoken up about her issues with your mum in front of his children: she seemed to genuinely love your dad and they were happy whereas he was not happy with your mum. You resented her for that alone, as if this whole mess was her fault. It wasn't. It was everybody's and it's more than possible your mum was not a good wife for him and that he actually was miserable in their marriage. Susan was being a \\*\\*\\*\\*. But that was her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou behaved even worse. The things you said were really, really wrong. You have a lot of anger for your father, that exploded at a really bad time. You need a much better therapist to sort through this hatred of how your parents lived their lives, because it is causing you to behave like an AH in front of friends and family. Everyone loves a good funeral where women scream at each other, but think about your mental health. You made things a lot worse for yourself, didn't you?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour brother is telling you not to \"do anything\".... What were you planning on doing?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
