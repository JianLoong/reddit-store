I stirred up a little argument with a friend and can feel tension building up between us that I do not like. Not sure if I am the asshole or I need other friends. Long story short: we were colleagues, she is near the end of a PhD in science, I took a normal boring job after graduation. She has always been better and more interested than me in school, in general. Now, I went through a personal loss that made me re-think my priorities in life, and might still have some kind of CPTSD from it. So, I stopped caring about \"prestige\" or any of the goals I previously had. I dont want to give more details. Now my friend is talking about the PhD and academia like it is the most important thing in the world, and will often talk about her great plans and whine about her paper not getting accepted like it is the purpose of her life. I scoffed at her once saying something like, academia is a dumpster fire anyways and life is more than that, you can always just get a real job. She took great offence probably because she's been starting shitty arguments with me since. We were okay on other terms but I feel like this topic might break the friendship. \n\nEDIT: Wow did this blow up. I guess you are all right, and I am little sour. I should apologize.

It doesn't apply for people that are not OP)", "That phrase makes my blood absolutely boil.\n\nOP, who the hell are you to decide what is and is not a real job? She works, doesn't she? She gets paid? She puts time and effort into it? Then it is a real job.\n\nBesides that, as others pointed out, she is supposed to be your friend. You support friends in their achievements and interests. Instead you dismissed them and shit all over them. YTA.", "Unless I am mistaken you can't get a PhD without teaching. Which is a 'real job'. OP YTA", "Some programs require teaching, most of them in the humanities, but doing research is the main activity during a PhD, which like teaching is a highly skilled job", "PhD student in Belgium here. Most of us don\u2019t have teaching duties, it depends whether your supervisor wants you to help out or not. Here in Europe it\u2019s common for PhD students to have a work contract for 3-5 years, meaning you have a dual student-university employee status, a salary (indexed with inflation yearly + bonuses), paid days off, pension, a 7.5 h a day work day (on paper at least) etc. It is, in the most literal sense, a job.", "That's true in the US, but not many other countries. I was looking at UK PhD programs specifically because they are research-focused and don't require teaching. I love teaching, but my advanced education is not in the field of my career, and a PhD would be a labor of love. It has to be a labor of love outside of my 40 hours a week, though, and strangely universities want teachers during business hours ( :) )\n\nI don't know first-hand, but since most of the PhD programs I'm familiar with are completely funded, I think the University expects the teaching in return. I'm not sure it's exactly that US programs demand teaching, so much as they pay you and expect you to work, and teaching is the obvious choice (though some people might rather clean, cook, etc!)", "You are mistaken, a PhD is a research qualification. It requires a thesis.", "I am sure there's a bit of difference depending on the country also. I didn't get my PhD but I seem to recall my brother teaching a lot which was his weak spot. This was maths.", "But, yes. Obviously research is the biggest!!! Biggester than than the bigger before. OP is a jerk!", "I am Danish. Not sure the 'here in Europe' works.", "I know that. But you need to teach as well? Could be different here. But obviously the thesis?!", "\ud83d\ude09", "I have former master\u2019s classmates who did their PhD in Copenhagen and the dual status and salary was pretty much the same conceptually as here, not sure on the finer details. Same in Sweden, the Netherlands and Germany at least that I\u2019m familiar with. I only know about STEM fields (nuclear physics/chemistry) others may differ.", "There may be institutions that require a teaching commitment to offer someone a PhD placement, but no, overall its not a requirement of a PhD. The assessment board wont be considering whether you did any teaching.", "I just realised I am also old and not updated. I am going to back out of this one. Facts remain the same, OP is AH", "YTA. As a PhD student myself, nothing hits below the belt like being told to \"get a real job\". Your friend is working hard to be successful in a field she wants to work in. You could just be supportive of that and respect their decisions", "Yes YTA, while it may not be important to you anymore this is HER passion! Why can't you just be happy for her doing and succeeding at the things she is invested in. That doesn't mean you have to be passionate about it too but you just support your friend.", "YTA. It took a friend of mine 7 years to complete his PhD. Of course it\u2019s the most important thing in her life, don\u2019t be so jealous of her smarts.", "Yta, you can say that about anything else really. Having a great job is bs, life is more than that, having kids is bs, life is more than that etc etc.", "YTA. Why are you friends if you don\u2019t support the things that she has going on in her life? Deal with your issues, but don\u2019t make them your friends issues too.", "yta and you\u2019re bitter\u2026af", "JSYK, the C in CPTSD is for \"complex,\" which in this context means, essentially, repeated. If an isolated bad thing happened to you, you would have PTSD from it, not CPTSD.", "Don\u2019t crap on someone\u2019s joy and purpose. YTA Being a friend is celebrating their joys and sharing their sorrows. Only being happy for them when their happiness lines up with yours isn\u2019t very open minded.", "To be fair, PhD students think that they know a lot more than they do and have little to no practical experience in their field.", "YTA", "YTA. \n\nPublishing is how she gets tenure, and grants, and students, and makes a career. To some extent until she is \"there\", it *is* her life. Tenure is also up or out - if she doesn't make it, she loses her job and likely has to move to another town/city. If you don't care about her job and ability to stay, you're saying you don't care much about her and probably should not be friends.", "NTA. What\u2019s going on in the world today shows a phd doesn\u2019t always mean something. People are pushing false information and hiding behind a phd. Not saying in all cases.", "Idk\u2026even tho YTA, I totally get what you\u2019re saying. So I guess that makes me an asshole too.", "i'll ignore this because English isn't OPs first language.\n\nbut still YTA", "How would you feel if your friend was upset about something you were doing, and instead of talking to you about it, did something to intentionally make you mad in exchange?", "European PhD is very different than a program in the US, not in a negative sense just a very different curriculum, coursework and examination.", "UK based in the humanities field, so could be very different experiences, but for humanities here scholarships are pretty competitive but don't require you to teach to pay anything back. However, since a lot of humanities academia jobs require teaching, it's seen as essential if you want to be considered for a lot of jobs."]}
