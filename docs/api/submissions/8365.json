I stirred up a little argument with a friend and can feel tension building up between us that I do not like. Not sure if I am the asshole or I need other friends. Long story short: we were colleagues, she is near the end of a PhD in science, I took a normal boring job after graduation. She has always been better and more interested than me in school, in general. Now, I went through a personal loss that made me re-think my priorities in life, and might still have some kind of CPTSD from it. So, I stopped caring about \"prestige\" or any of the goals I previously had. I dont want to give more details. Now my friend is talking about the PhD and academia like it is the most important thing in the world, and will often talk about her great plans and whine about her paper not getting accepted like it is the purpose of her life. I scoffed at her once saying something like, academia is a dumpster fire anyways and life is more than that, you can always just get a real job. She took great offence probably because she's been starting shitty arguments with me since. We were okay on other terms but I feel like this topic might break the friendship. \n\nEDIT: Wow did this blow up. I guess you are all right, and I am little sour. I should apologize.

Not caring about goals doesn't make you a better person - goals matter to people and they are a very healthy and functional way to organize your life. You are assuming her goals are externally motivated, by what others will think of her. I'd have to guess that is all projection - when you had goals they were externally motivated and that's why you didn't find them valuable and dropped them. Treating her as a friend would look like assuming her goals are internally motivated - she is doing this because she cares about becoming the person it is helping her be, regardless of what others think.
