School kinda sucked and didn\u2019t do anything about it. I am 4 years older than  my brother and Max. I didn\u2019t have the money to go to college so I spent a few years saving up cash. I went to a community college and Max was there with me.\n\nWe were in the same track, so we worked together before. I don\u2019t get close to him until my grandfather died and my family didn\u2019t tell me until the day of the funeral. It was rough and he really helped me out. I brought up his bullying and he told me he will send a letter to apologize. My brother got it and basically said I don\u2019t forgive him which is his right.\n\nI am 34 now and I am still close with him. He is being my best man. I told my family this and most were happy since they know how much he has helped me out before. My brother on the other hand hates it. He told me he won\u2019t come to my wedding if he is invited. We got in an argument with me just saying you can\u2019t be in the same building and not talk to someone. He claims it\u2019s is the principal of it and won\u2019t go to the wedding unless I uninvited him. That I am picking a bully over him, buts it\u2019s been almost 15 years and he has helped me so much\n\n\nEdit: anyways I talked to my brother this doesnt really have anyhting to do with max and more with me, he is upset that he isn\u2019t best man. He was upset by that and didn\u2019t want to go at the beginning when he heard it was max that made it worse and brought up old feelings about middle school. We had a nice conversation and I explained why he wasn\u2019t chosen, we arnt close. Also brought up I wasn\u2019t in his wedding party either. We are all good and he is gonna go. Also shows him this thread and we had a good laugh about it\n\nI find it really weird that people don\u2019t believe people change especially this happened in middle school.", "created_utc": 1685995167, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/141pvjy/aita_for_choosing_my_brothers_school_bully_over/", "score": 4715, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your brother made this decision in particular when he was one of the people who didn\u2019t tell you about your grandfather. It has been a long time, and you and your brother have clearly grown apart.\n\nIt\u2019s reasonable for you to want your best friend with you. It\u2019s reasonable for your brother to hate your best friend. It\u2019s reasonable for you to ask him to tolerate it for one day. It\u2019s reasonable for him to say no.\n\nI think you suck a little bit for making friends with your brother\u2019s bully in the first place, but that AH behaviour is a ship that\u2019s long since sailed. Max sucks a lot more for not having the grace to not invade the family space of someone he used to bully, as well as for being a bully in the first place.\n\nYour relationship with your brother isn\u2019t going to survive this choice, but this isn\u2019t a new situation - the wedding is just what\u2019s made clear that you prefer your relationship with Max to your relationship with him. Not inviting Max wouldn\u2019t suddenly magically make your brother more important in your life than Max is. Realising that is painful for him, and you and Max are the ones whose decisions caused that hurt, so it\u2019s up to you to be as graceful as you can and not make this any worse by firing back.", "You can pick whoever you want to be in your wedding, but those choices have consequences.  There is no time limit on being hurt. There is no law or rule or anything that says your brother has to get over his being bullied by a certain amount of time. You're not the AH for picking whoever you want at your wedding. You are the AH for picking someone who bullied your brother. Also, that bully didn't even apologize until you said something...doesn't sound to me like they are sorry for anything.", "YTA\n\nI think you are ignoring what actually happened, because you already made up your mind\n\nyou said in the comments that \"bullying\" consisted of \"name calling\" and \"not inviting to a party\", which even barely qualifies as such. Did you learn that from Max? Are you sure there isn't much more to the story you brother doesn't even want to tell you?\n\nit would be extremely unusual to not want to be in the same building with someone who didn't invite you to a party 20 years ago... it wouldn't be strange if someone shoved your head into urinal and spit in your face", "To me YTA, you don't get to decide when someone gets over being bullied.  Some people never do, it scars them for life.  If your brother still feels this strongly years after the event it was clearly worse for him than you know however much you want to minimise it.", "Well, you can invite anyone you want to your wedding, but you dont have the right to get upset if your brother doesnt go. In this situation if i was your brother wouldnt go to the wedding and i would keep a distance from you. Bullying in a young age can be really traumatic. For your brother you are the YTA. Shouldnt your friend understand that he shouldnt go to the wedding as kind of an apology to your brother?", "It sounds like your brother was truly traumatized by Max.  I still remember the bullies I dealt with in school, and even though I see them from time to time, we won't be having playdates.  Your brother is hurt you are choosing the person who made his life hell as a kid over him and made him your best friend.  That is understandable, but it is also understandable that you want someone who has supported you with you at your wedding.  It's sad that you are in this position, but you can't tell your brother how to feel.  \n\nIt is also an issue that Max apparently means more to you than your brother, best man and all, and that could be part of your brothers' problem.  Maybe you could talk to your brother to find out what the real issue is here, this could be a rift that goes on for years.", "YTA\n\nIts your wedding sure enough and you do what you want. Unfortunately you aren't entitled to your brothers presence, nor is this other person entitled to forgiveness.\n\nBullying can have deep and long lasting impacts on people. Your brother doesn't have to go anywhere he doesn't want to be.\n\nWhen he said he wasn't going, instead of respecting him as an autonomous individual you started a fight about it.", "I don't think you (or even Max) truly remember what happened. You're 4 years older than your brother. At the time of bullying, you were in high school, living your own life. You (or Max) may have thought the bullying was just name calling or not inviting him to a party. But honistly, the bullying most likely also had much deeper traumatizing elements. Like ostarizing, egging on others to partake in bullying, and emotional abuse. \n\nYTA for not taking your brother into consideration. Not when he was in middle school or now. It says a lot about your character that you befriended your brothers bully and didn't bother to reflect on your actions until he refused to go to your wedding. Which you also asked said bully to be in... and not your brother. Ass hole all around.", "YTA\n\nWhatever happened between him and your brother may not seem like much to you or Max, especially in hindsight, but it's something that has obviously traumatized and haunted your brother ever since.\n\nI'm not writing YTA for making this decision, I'm writing YTA because it is absolutely clear that in 15+ years you've never truly understood how this has affected your brother.", "It is your wedding, so you are free to do what ever you want to do. But, your choices have consequences. Initially, when you started your friendship with this bully, you did so knowing full well how he treated your brother - and at the time, you were 100% OK with this - I think this says it all. It says how little respect you have for your brother. You only get one life dude - is this friend more important than your brother? Are you willing to accept the long term consequences of taking this action? I would say YTA - but, sometimes, arseholes are happy being arseholes, and are happy to not learn anything or try to become better people. So, its up to you.", "INFO: You don\u2019t care very much for your brother, do you? Max doesn\u2019t either, because if he actually wanted to fix the problem, he would\u2019ve made overtures to apologize in person, and made overtures to become close with him as he is with you. If these things were declined then I would almost sympathize with you, but a letter is a cop out, and you don\u2019t seem to be bothered by that.", "Sorry, but YTA. Bullies ruined my life. I'm not over it, and I probably never will be. I couldn't stand to be in the same room as one.", "Yeah you are an asshole. Why would you choose an asshole over your own brother dude. Disgusted", "YTA. The fact that you had to mention the bullying he inflicted on your brother to Max, before he apologized says everything.  \n\nMax wasn\u2019t losing any sleep over what he did, whereas your brother probably has long term physiological scars from what Max did - that can be impossible to heal.", "YTA. So him being nice somehow makes his treatment of your brother null and void. \nI have two questions:\n\nWhy do you hate your brother?\n\nAnd despite the fact you saw your brothers suffering first hand you still then chose to bring up the person who caused that suffering. \n\nWith siblings like you he really doesn\u2019t need enemies ngl. Also if he cuts you off for good that\u2019s on you.", "I'm sorry but Bullying sucks\nYTA", "YTA 100%", "YTA. Unless you and your brother are distant then there\u2019s no way you should have befriended his bully to begin with. Years of treating someone like shit don\u2019t go away with an \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d letter.", "YTA. I've personally got no sympathy for bullies because I've been bullied before. And me personally I don't associate myself with people who are close to them and if any of my friends in my friends circle is close to them, i avoid them. You can't tell others that it's been a long time and that you should get over it. It's the 21st century and that dude sent his apology via a letter? Even if it was a text it doesn't mean shit until you apologise to them face to face unless it's physically impossible to do so, which I don't think is the case here. I feel sorry for your brother. Being friends with the object of your nightmares must be terrible for him.", "Unless your brother is known for exaggerating things, YTA. What you have stated as bullying sounds like it's from Max' perspective. And you seem to be downplaying bullying as not too serious overall, when it can have a LIFETIME effect on people. Have you sat down with your brother and asked him why he feels this strongly? This whole thing seems weird, and my judgement could change based on additional info.", "YTA.  I was bullied in grammar and high school.  Decades after it happened,  it still brings me to tears if I think about it.  It's the ultimate FU to your brother to not just invite the bully to have such an important role, but to tell him to not even go to the ceremony is a kick to the gut.  \n\nNo matter how long ago it happened,  your friend made your brother's life a living hell.  And now you've not just turned your back to him, but are favoring the bully.", "YTA have at your wedding who you like, but by your math Max was your brother\u2019s bully in MS thru HS and sounds like despite that you became close with them shortly after, which is just really crappy as a sibling.", "I was bullied so bad in elementary I had to change schools. I have never forgiven the girl that made my life hell. Every few years she reaches out on social media and I always tell her \u201capology not accepted, when you can give me back all the things you took from me then we can talk\u201d \n\nYTA you don\u2019t get to say when or if your brother gets over this. Simply you can\u2019t have both men at your wedding so make sure you make the right choice.", "YTA. you're saying that it's 'only' name-calling and not inviting to a party but even that can seriously fuck up with people's self-esteem and cause trauma, especially for children/teens", "YTA\n\nOr at least, your brother is reasonable in thinking you are.\nIf it matters to anyone in the picture, Max and bro may need to actually sit down and talk. An apology can feel really thin if you didn't look someone in the eye and see and hear the hurt you caused, if you didn't find a way to try and create repair. Otherwise it's just words designed to make you feel better, not the person who was actually harmed.\n\nUnless your brother is a narcissist that just wants you to pick sides to show loyalty (mine is, So I'd get that, but it doesn't sound like it), you are saying his hurt *also* doesn't matter to you. And.yoi choose bully over brother, because he never hurt *you*. If you actually have any love for your bro, this *is* actually a shitty message to send.", "YTA. I imagine your brother will not speak with you after this and I don\u2019t blame him.", "YTA . Good lord. How can you not see this.", "YTA - it isn\u2019t enough for your brother to go, he HAS to socialize with his bully? You\u2019re entitled af.", "Info  : what was involved in the bullying ?", "You don\u2019t get to tell someone when their trauma gets to be over even if it\u2019s been 15 years to your brother bet some of it still feels fresh\n\nYou get\nTo choose who you invite. Just like your brother has the right to choose him feeling safe and not attending your wedding", "Yta, hope your brother cuts you out of his life.", "Info: Did you ever talk to your brother about what Max did to him/how it made him feel? Or did you dismiss your brother's feelings and pain solely on the fact you lived in the same house? If you all went to the same school, had overlap in extra curriculars, frequented similar hang outs, heck youre all young enough that cyber bullying was a thing in school by then, those are all avenues where your brother could have been bullied in and you would have had no idea. Plus 4 yrs btwn siblings isn't a lot in adulthood, but I'm schools that can be enough to have enough separation where you don't really know what your siblings are going thru. Not being invited to a party might be a one off thing, or it could have been a sign that your brother was constantly socially isolated in school because of the bullying he experienced. If you only ever talked to Max about, IE the bully, then of course he was going to downplay it and make it seem trivial cuz almost no bully is ever going to be honest about the pain they cause \n\nYTA for how quickly you are to believe your brother's bully without question and assume you know all there is to know about the bullying simply cuz you lived in the same house.", "YTA the axe forgets but the tree remembers, it was definitely more than just \u201cname calling\u201d and excluding him but bullies often don\u2019t see what they did as bullying.

So thats my reason.", "YTA.\n\nYou're acting like the bullying doesn't/shouldn't matter because it was \"almost 15 years ago.\" It doesn't matter; the trauma from bullying lasts forever. Lots of people get bullied, but it really stings when your own family makes friends with the bully and even makes them their best man. Max doesn't care about your brother; saying \"OK, I'll write him a letter\" doesn't sound like remorse to me.", "That's a tough one. \n\nA person that means a lot to you is such a source of unhappiness for your brother. \n\nI'm thinking that if I were in your shoes, maybe I would want the bully to go talk to your brother in person and ask how he could make it right (if that's even possible) - even if it's just for your sake. \n\nI feel that the bully might also want to bow out to ensure that there are no issues in YOUR family. \n\nIt's hard to take sides, but with bullying it's easy to see who was wrong - the bully was. \n\nThe question here really comes down to how much your brother means to you.", " I think that YTA- I would like to know what your fianc\u00e9 thinks.", "YTA", "You can absolutely choose your brother's bully over your brother. Just don't pretend that's not exactly what you're doing.

You are very dismissive of your brother. Why did no one tell you about your grandfather? Gotta be a reason for that. I just think there was a whole lot more to it than a party and some name calling for him to still be holding onto it for so long.

Why would you befriend someone who bullied your brother? WTF is wrong with you? Obviously the bully isn't really sorry or he would have apologized before you brought it up. An apology alone doesn't really cut it.

This is just a guy who was the oldest of (way too) many siblings, and there is a responsibility that comes with being the oldest. #1 is not allowing your little brother to be tormented, and #2 has got to be not making friends with their bully. \n\nNext thing you're going to tell us is the woman you're marrying once slapped the shit out of your Mom", "YTA\n\nJesus Christ I can\u2019t even imagine *starting a friendship with someone who I knew bullied one of my siblings*, let alone continuing that friendship and deepening it so much you ask them to be your best man.\n\nHow could you type all that out and not realize you\u2019re TA?

I don't know what the letter said, but lets give him the benefit of the doubt that it was genuine in its apology. At least as you portray it, it was a spontaneous offer after you brought up the subject, not something you pressed him to do and he did reluctantly. I am willing to take that as a sign of maturity and growth since that phase in his life.\n\nYour brother is under no obligation to accept the apology though, no matter how sincere. The hurt he felt as a kid was real, and he doesn't need to forgive if he doesn't want to.\n\nNearly decades on though... while you should be understanding of your brother's feeling here, you also can balance that with the fact that Max has *probably* grown and changed a *lot* from the 13 year old asshole he was. *Most of us do!* Add to that that he recognized he was a 13 year old asshole and made an apology...

I went to a community college and Max was there with me.\n\nWe were in the same track, so we worked together before. I don\u2019t get close to him until my grandfather died and my family didn\u2019t tell me until the day of the funeral. It was rough and he really helped me out. I brought up his bullying and he told me he will send a letter to apologize. My brother got it and basically said I don\u2019t forgive him which is his right.\n\nI am 34 now and I am still close with him. He is being my best man. I told my family this and most were happy since they know how much he has helped me out before. My brother on the other hand hates it. He told me he won\u2019t come to my wedding if he is invited. We got in an argument with me just saying you can\u2019t be in the same building and not talk to someone. He claims it\u2019s is the principal of it and won\u2019t go to the wedding unless I uninvited him.

I know some times written apologies can be nothing but excuses that backed up negative behavior. \"At the time of xyz, I was going through this and that. So that's why I was a huge dick. \" Which is NOT taking ownership of the trauma he caused.", "Or it could be brother is holding a grudge towards a kid calling him names 15 years ago. Even when that person sent a heartfelt apology and showed up to be a good person as an adult. Also you have no idea if he was traumatized, trauma is serious and not something that should be thrown around when someone is just upset", ">o \n\nOP said name callings and one-time Max didn't invite him to a party (but invited everyone else). It was a d\\*ick move, but I don't think it couldn't be solved if talked like adults. I think, well... one can invite whomever they want but if Max is really that good of a friend, he will understand if he is uninvited and the friendship will continue.

I had a girl tell me I looked like a pig when I was in 5th grade and was consistently mean to me, sure it was bullying and I hated her, but it did not *traumatize* me . You simply can\u2019t say for sure how bad it was. If it was really that terrible why did OPs brother say it was just name calling and excluding him. Also wouldn\u2019t that bully who traumatized him really end up to be a supportive and kind person as an adult? To the point he wants to apologize and writes a heartfelt letter?

The facts of this post is that OPs own brother told him the bullying consisted of name calling and being excluded from a party.

He proved himself to be a good person by providing support when OP found out about his grandpas death the day of the funeral. He also was there for him many other times in his life.

Did you just not give a fuck if your brother had to see his bully at the wedding? Did you think he would just be cool with it?", "YTA, people don't change.", "YTA Difficult to believe you can't see that.", "Well, for me, if I found someone had bullied one of my siblings, no way in HELL would I ever befriend them, EVER.\n\nYTA just for that alone.   I don't care if it was middle school and we are all grandparents now.  You treated my sibling like crap, you don't deserve my friendship. Period.", "NTA- your brother is kind of childish for holding a grudge about something that happened in middle school. Max tried to apologize, and has definitely changed since then.", "NAH! Like you said, it's his right to not forgive his bully. I believe that people change, have been the bully and the bullied. I also have some old high school bullies I'd be okay with going to a wedding if they were there, and some i wouldn't. Your friend helped you through something really tough, and that's worth something. I've seen your edit, but had I not I'd have said that while it is your right to invite max, you'll have to accept that it could mean your brother not going. However I am so glad to see how everything worked out in the end, and congratulations on your soon to be wedding.", "NTA. Being a sibling doesn't give him the right to be the best man. The best man should be someone you're close to, and a lot of times, it isn't a family member.", "Nah.\n\nYour brother has a right to not want to be around max, but he doesn't get to tell you who will be at your own wedding.\n\nYour wedding is a day of celebration and if everyone there can't be happy for you then they should go.\n\nBut you have to understand that your brother went through a horrible time and although, max could have changed and is a better person, you brother only knows that horrible bully.\n\nImagine going to a celebration of love and just to being anxious because you don't know if you bully will jump out of nowhere and shove him in a bin, or something. His trauma is valid but so is max being your support.\n\nYour just going to have to figure out if your brother means more then your friend.\n\nBecause your brother is definitely going to use this decision, to determine how important he is in your life, and will most likely go low/no contact with you, moving forward.", "This comes post edit, but my vote would have been the same - NAH.  I was bullied horribly.  If one of my bullies changed their course of life, no longer hurt others, and apologized - I would definitely forgive.  I eventually even became on good terms with one of my former bullies because she had changed as the years went on.  That is a personal choice, so I don't fault your brother for not forgiving, but I also don't fault you or Max.", "I\u2019m glad to read that OP and his brother were able to resolve this amicably.\n\nHopefully, the bully is truly remorseful and has changed (though many never do) and the younger brother can forgive his brother and maybe even the bully (don\u2019t blame him if not and/or if he chooses to avoid him for his own well-being).", ">and I explained why he wasn\u2019t chosen, we arnt close. Also brought up I wasn\u2019t in his wedding party either.\n\nOf course you guys aren't close and you weren't in his wedding party.  You are friends with the guy that bullied him as a kid.  You didn't help your bro out when he was getting bullied even though you're his older brother.  Your parents did a shit job with you.\n\nYTA of course.", "YTA.\n\nThe edit doesn't change anything - if nothing else, it just shows your little brother is the bigger man than you, a disloyal sibling.\n\nYou have plainly never been bullied, and were probably one yourself - along with any other clown here saying NTA.\n\nI'm starting to see why your family didn't tell you about your grandfather's death, because you plainly don't care about your family.", "yTA. Y\u2019all had a good laugh about how an awful sibling you are and how everyone in the comments was calling you out?", "NTA. Geez so many people in this sub must have been badly bullied, they\u2019re so unforgiving. Sounds like Max grew up, as many people do. Sounds like your brother hasn\u2019t, which is sad, but it\u2019s his problem he needs to face. Denying you an adult friend forever because he used to bully him as a teenager just doesn\u2019t stack up. Getting all upset at not being best man is so self-centred. It\u2019s not his wedding, and when it was he didn\u2019t ask you! Your brother can\u2019t hold you hostage with his low self-esteem. If he declines to attend, that\u2019s on him.", ">It\u2019s reasonable for you to want your best friend with you. It\u2019s reasonable for your brother to hate your best friend. It\u2019s reasonable for you to ask him to tolerate it for one day. It\u2019s reasonable for him to say no.  \n>  \n>I think you suck a little bit for making friends with your brother\u2019s bully in the first place, but that AH behaviour is a ship that\u2019s long since sailed. Max sucks a lot more for not having the grace to not invade the family space of someone he used to bully, as well as for being a bully in the first place.\n\nThis is exactly how I feel. Nobody, including you, OP, have the right to decide when someone can get over bullying at such an impressionable age. Fifteen years is the blink of an eye to somebody who had a miserable bullying experience in middle school. \n\nAnd as u/NJtoOx said, \"Jesus Christ I can\u2019t even imagine starting a friendship with someone who I knew bullied one of my siblings...\" At best you're obtuse, OP.\n\nYou know what? If Max really wants to show substantial remorse for bullying your brother, he can volunteer to step aside as best man. Maybe your brother could tolerate having Max attend the wedding as a mere guest, even better if you make your brother the best man. \n\nYTA.", "Yeah I agree YTA for expecting him to just deal with it. Does he even know what max put his brother through? The emotional damage he cause? He can invite who he wants, he can have the guy as his best man. But he has no right to expect his brother to get over what he went through, just cause the guy was good to him. I wonder if max even remembers bullying op brother?", "Also, who the hell befriends their siblings bully to begin with!?", "A letter isn\u2019t amends. And it isn\u2019t up the the bully to force forgiveness. It is up to the victim to forgive.", "I had an oddly similar experience. I was complaining about this guy who messed with me all the time, and someone said \"Wait, that guy? He was talking about what a great guy you are the other day, are you sure he doesn't like you?\"", "Ehhh, i have a great relationship with my brothers and I still might pick my best friend to be my best man instead.", "I feel you. \n\nMy sis's ex \"best friends\" that actually treated her poorly her entire \"friendship\" are in the same career than me. I have crossed paths and being cordial with them in the past, and maybe I'll do more in the future. But my relationship with them will never be more than being cordial because I know the s*it the put my sis through.", "Yeah I don\u2019t understand being friends with someone who tormented our sibling. Even if he didn\u2019t know once he learned about it, how could he pick max over his brother? Unless they weren\u2019t close and didn\u2019t get along. It\u2019s still a shitty thing to do. And if he brother can\u2019t forgive him years later, it must have been really bad. I don\u2019t blame the brother for not going to the wedding.", "I agree. I, unfortunately,  was involved in a bullying incident (one time, not ongoing, which doesn't count for much) when I was 12 and after high school spent 20 years hunting her down to tell her how truly sorry I was.", "We have no information about grandpas death and what happens there. Those are all just assumptions.", "I think you're projecting much.\n\nWe don't know the extent of the bullying that happened in middle school. \n\nCalling someone bottom of the boat trash because of their actions when they were 11 is fucking wild.\n\nThe way you write makes it seem like you were greatly affected by the bullying you received in your childhood, which is completely valid, but it's bold to assume everyone went through a similar experience as you did.\n\n\\>inb4 you call me a bully apologist or something to deflect any points I made", "I was severily bullied by my best friend to the point I transferred schools. She was just hurting badly herself and lashed out. We are grown ups now and I don\u2019t care anymore cuz I now it was not about me, it was about her. You grow, they grow, things pass. Might not be same for everyone, but it happens often. Might have been something similar here. Most bullies bully because they feel pain themselves and cannot cope.", "Do you even read your own words? Like ever? This is a ridiculous response\n\nBullying sucks. There's no way around it, bullying is incredibly shitty.\n\nBut people change. It sounded like OP found a decent friend in Max when they were both adults. And that friendship grew stronger when Max helped him through the death of his grandfather.\n\nIt's not like OP and Max are out terrorizing kids together, they're close adult friends. Why would OP choose their not-very-close brother as best man over OP's closest friend?\n\nAnd why would OP outright refuse to consider a friendship with somebody who was a shitdick when they were\n\n*Checks notes*\n\nFucking 12 years old?", "No, that was OP explaining to his brother why he ended up befriending his former bully. Because OP and Max were in the same track in college, which means they would have had the same classes and/or would have had classes in the same building, and that's why he said you can't be in the same building as someone and not talk to them. He was trying to justify why he talked to/got close to Max in the first place.", "If the brother DID, in fact, know about grandpa\u2019s death, how would he know his brother wasn\u2019t told????", "Good for you that you feel you have to be right well done  still try to humble yourself and and stop comparing your life to others", "My husband found out about his father\u2019s death on Facebook because his uncle posted about it. His step mom never called him. It wasn\u2019t until the end of the day, after everyone else knew, that his brother called to tell him. He\u2019s always been pushed aside like that, but whenever he didn\u2019t allow relatives to control him or didn\u2019t allow them to use our resources, how they want, for their own benefit they would be mad at us and act like we were selfish cold jerks who don\u2019t love our family\u2026even though allowing those things would have been destructive to our finances and our ability to pay our bills, feed our children, and have a home (they wanted us to let them live for free in the other apartment of our house, which was not in good repair and we couldn\u2019t repair it, nor afford the mortgage anymore\u2026they weren\u2019t happy that we wanted to sell our house instead and buy a bigger cheaper single family one out of state that we can afford and that is big enough for our kids). That house was costing us $2,000/mo, while we lived in one 800sq ft unit with our kids, and made less than $4,000/mo. They wanted to live in the other apt for free! After he died, he tried to follow through on his promise to keep contact with step mom. She wasn\u2019t very responsive though, to updates or pictures we sent of our kids, including the announcement of the birth of our baby and pictures of her. She seemed uninterested on the phone. We know now she was mentally ill, as she recently took her life. Doesn\u2019t change that my husband was deeply, deeply hurt. This was the only viable mother figure he has, as the biological one married a belligerent sex offender and she seems to have a cluster b personality. \n\nSome families cause nothing but immense heartache to people. My husband is a wonderful person who loves sincerely. He is an amazing father to our 5 kids. People who have healthy families have no idea how harmful some families can be, without even physically abusing you. We don\u2019t know what kind of family OP has. I\u2019m sorry his brother was a victim of bullying, I have experienced this myself. However I kind of feel like he is being manipulated emotionally and that\u2019s not fair.", "Or was told, but wasn't told that OP didn't know and just assumed, as is reasonable, that their parents would have told him.\n\nWhen my grandfather died I didn't call to inform my sister and my sister didn't tell me. We both just assumed our mom told the other. Which is what happened, and would be what happens in most families I would assume.", "Writing an apology letter as a bully is at least acknowledging being wrong. And in many cases its most bully can do. Often bullied person doesnt want to have anything to do with bully. In such case going for face to face apology would be selfish, cause it would be causing distress for bullied person. What more can be done? Send money? Do charity work about which bullied person wont probably even know? Im not trying to ridicule the idea, i mean those questions.\n\nBullying is terrible, yes. But some people change.\nYou wrote \"Bullies should always be treated as a belligerent until they make a notable effort to rectify their behaviour and account for their actions. Anything else is taking sides with the bully which is never okay under any circumstances.\" i strongly disagree with \"always\" and \"never\" parts. While bullying is bad, its not nearly as bad to treat it in absolutes.", "stop telling people what to do. I\u2019m free to share my experiences when talking about topics.

Good luck with life have the one you deserve", "Same. I assumed it was a typo.", "YTA especially for the edit.

He is an important person in your life and you want to honour that.", "Pretty reasonable response. A lot of people in the comments section who have reaaaaallly obviously not healed from their experience with being bullied.\n\nI dunno who Max is now, but in most cases I would accept that a middle school aged pre teen child is not the same person as the adult person they've grown into. \n\nIn my experience, hurt people, hurt people. It's not an excuse, but an explanation that often leads me to respond with compassion and forgiveness. So many kids are struggling themselves and their coping mechanism are... not good.\n\nI hope op's brother is able to heal fully from the bullying he's experienced. In my experience, it warms the heart to meet someone who was cruel to you as a child and share a hug and an understanding of forgiveness given and receive.", "That's not the question. It doesn't actually matter if he is still traumatised or not. It is her wedding. Max has clearly changed and become so close they want him as a best man. \nSo her saying tgat she will not uninvite him is her choice for her wedding. Brother should, despite his trauma be able to go to an event like this. Nobody is forcing him to speak to max or go near him. \nI also think that when someone truely regrets and shows you, asks for your forgiveness, you should give it. I'm not talking murder or rape here and even murder, in some cases, I would still consider forgiving depending on circumstances, attitude and behaviour the the murderer after having paid his time. But that is not relevant here in any case. \nAlso I have little empathy for those with trauma that do nothing to help themselves. Just staying in your anger, scares, and own thoughts are nit going to help. Being mean to others, or in this case refusing to go to a wedding because you have done nothing and still want to be seen as the poor victim decades after, is frankly AHish", "So you would uninvite your best man because your little brother was bullied by them years ago? The brother shouldn't also get to decide who is invited to someone else's wedding but they tried that, didn't they? The bully obviously knew their behaviour was wrong and tried to make amends. Because the brother isn't over it does not justify him making demands on your life and your choices.

I don't see your logic here. In my honest opinion, NTA.", "Are you reading the same post as I am here? Where did the brother tell him to get over the bullying? He even said it was HIS RIGHT not to accept the apology.\n\nHe's in no way minimizing this, but what happened to his brother has nothing to do with his relationship with Max.\n\nAnd as you can see in the update the brother is okay with it now.", "Jfc it was 15 years ago. Do you think  no one changes ever??", "This. We really need more info", "Assholes do that shit", "If you\u2019re trying to move on from past mistakes you shouldn\u2019t continue to upset and hurt the people you impacted though.

Forcing their victim to hear about them/see them all the time for years after the initial bullying.\n\nMax didn\u2019t even apologize on his own. If he had apologized because he grew up and felt bad then maybe it\u2019d be different but he only apologized because OP brought it up. A forced apology is not a real apology", "Lmao a heartfelt apology letter? He only sent a letter after OP practically asked him to, that\u2019s not heartfelt.", "not if someone bullied my sibling and don\u2019t apologize until it could benefit them.

You shouldn\u2019t have to ask for an apology.\n\nThere\u2019s second chances and then there\u2018s inviting your siblings bully into your life and becoming best friends with them while knowing the whole time how upset it makes your sibling.

Youre not him either and you have no better idea than I do whether or not the brother is traumatized. All we have is Ops facts that he shared. Assuming and throwing the word trauma is not helpful to people with PTSD like myself. Just because something upsets you does not mean you\u2019re traumatized.
