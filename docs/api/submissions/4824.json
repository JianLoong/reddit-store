Reasonable people don't throw their phone on the ground destroying it. Sounds like your brother is an entitled brat and your mother enables him. Tell her to let him use her phone.

Or read an actual book.", "INFO: how old is your brother?\n\nETA: You bought it with your own money, it belongs to you and should be respected as your property.\n\nYour brother has demonstrated lack of responsibility where expensive electronics are concerned.\n\n**NTA.**", "NTA\n\nIt's not your fault that your brother smashed his phone. It's the consequence of his own actions. Maybe he should think about not throwing his phone on the ground.", "Nta, and he should read a book", "NTA tell him to rent some books and kick it old school", "NTA - you bought that tablet with money you saved; it is your personal property and your brother destroyed his own phone, I guess in a temper tantrum.  Your mother is totally out of line to expect you to put your device into his hands.  She should have either just gotten him a new phone or the tablet without ever saying a word to you.  This was not your responsibility to handle.  It is not selfish to not want to share your personal belongings, especially with a destructive child.", "Nta. He threw his phone on the ground and ruined it. It's not your responsibility to sacrifice what you spent your money on, just because he likes to act like a toddler.", "NTA !! It is your own device which u saved money for to buy it! With YOUR money. So it is your right to use it!! It is not your responsibility to make sure that ur brother would be able to do something in the plane because of something he did to himself!", "NTA, also include ages in your post. I saw your comment saying your brother was 15/16, I originally thought he was a child of about 6yo. He certainly acted childish enough...", "NTA\n\nA consequence for how he treated his device means he doesn't have one for the plane ride.\n\nMaybe he'll remember that the next time.", "NTA first it\u2019s yours you bought it with your money? Second he doesn\u2019t know how to take care of his things. Third he didn\u2019t even ask you himself.

And the tablet is the one I use to entertain myself when travelling, the phone is a phone(for my purposes) even though both are of the fruit with a bite out of it brand.

Can your mom/dad lend their phone?", "I\u2019m sorry if this sounds creepy and I hope it doesn\u2019t come across as so, how old are you OP?

Your mom sounds like one of those people who is very generous with someone else's belongings. Doesn't she have a phone he can play with on the trip?", "NTA - He doesn't have a phone because he threw his on the group and broke it. Sounds like his lack of in flight entertainment is the consequence of his own actions.", "What is wrong with a book??", "NTA.  Your brother can get an old fashioned book and just read that on the trip", "NTA but you better get a security cord and a bracelet for it before you go on that trip.", "NTA, but why not let your brother use your phone for the duration of the plane ride?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
