Reasonable people don't throw their phone on the ground destroying it. Sounds like your brother is an entitled brat and your mother enables him. Tell her to let him use her phone.

Or read an actual book.", "INFO: how old is your brother?\n\nETA: You bought it with your own money, it belongs to you and should be respected as your property.\n\nYour brother has demonstrated lack of responsibility where expensive electronics are concerned.\n\n**NTA.**", "NTA\n\nIt's not your fault that your brother smashed his phone. It's the consequence of his own actions. Maybe he should think about not throwing his phone on the ground.", "Nta, and he should read a book", "NTA tell him to rent some books and kick it old school", "NTA - you bought that tablet with money you saved; it is your personal property and your brother destroyed his own phone, I guess in a temper tantrum.  Your mother is totally out of line to expect you to put your device into his hands.  She should have either just gotten him a new phone or the tablet without ever saying a word to you.  This was not your responsibility to handle.  It is not selfish to not want to share your personal belongings, especially with a destructive child.", "Nta. He threw his phone on the ground and ruined it. It's not your responsibility to sacrifice what you spent your money on, just because he likes to act like a toddler.", "NTA !! It is your own device which u saved money for to buy it! With YOUR money. So it is your right to use it!! It is not your responsibility to make sure that ur brother would be able to do something in the plane because of something he did to himself!", "NTA, also include ages in your post. I saw your comment saying your brother was 15/16, I originally thought he was a child of about 6yo. He certainly acted childish enough...", "NTA\n\nA consequence for how he treated his device means he doesn't have one for the plane ride.\n\nMaybe he'll remember that the next time.", "NTA first it\u2019s yours you bought it with your money? Second he doesn\u2019t know how to take care of his things. Third he didn\u2019t even ask you himself. If he did you could maybe compromise and watch a show together on Netflix with headphones but he didn\u2019t ask.", "NTA.  At least someone in your family has managed to teach this kid about consequences.", "Nta. Your brother broke his phone on purpose. He deserves nothing", "NTA- I have a phone and a tablet too. And the tablet is the one I use to entertain myself when travelling, the phone is a phone(for my purposes) even though both are of the fruit with a bite out of it brand. So, nope, they are not redundant and you may not have my entertainment source.", "NTA. He doesn\u2019t take care of things.", "Can you led your phone? Can your mom/dad lend their phone?", "I\u2019m sorry if this sounds creepy and I hope it doesn\u2019t come across as so, how old are you OP?

Your mom sounds like one of those people who is very generous with someone else's belongings. Doesn't she have a phone he can play with on the trip?", "NTA - He doesn't have a phone because he threw his on the group and broke it. Sounds like his lack of in flight entertainment is the consequence of his own actions.", "What is wrong with a book??", "NTA.  Your brother can get an old fashioned book and just read that on the trip", "NTA but you better get a security cord and a bracelet for it before you go on that trip.", "NTA, but why not let your brother use your phone for the duration of the plane ride?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Don't worry about it.", "That\u2019s what I said (letting him borrow her phone) but she just scoffed", "Oh, the horrors of not being entertained by a tablet for four hours.  Huge eye roll.  So entitled and the OP's mother just made it worse by getting him a tablet.", ">  *read an actual book*\n\nCame here to say this.  He can go to a *public library* and get several books.\n\nI suspect that he's already broken his tablet, OP.\n\nNTA", "He\u2019s 15, 16 in a few months", "That was my first thought. A paperback is super portable, provides hours on entertainment, and they don\u2019t break when you throw them on the ground.", "My mom bought him a tablet last minute pfft", "I don\u2019t post my art for now, I want to wait a little until I get better haha.

He is just a teenager who acts like one.", "Nice, he gets rewarded for throwing a teenage tantrum. Definitely the best way to resolve the issue. /s", "Is this a pattern in your household, that your brother's wishes take precedence over anything you want/need?", "This isn\u2019t actually too common, it\u2019ll happen every once in a while but I was just really frustrated with this one", "NTA-your immature brother threw his phone and broke it-tell him to read a freaking book on how to not act like a spoiled child.", "So, you are selfish and self-centered for not lending your tablet to a 15 year old who had a violent temper tantrum and broke his phone?  Yeah, no.  You are smart and practical and thinking ahead is what you are.  NTA", "Yeah but she had gotten him a tablet the next morning", "NTA. Your brother is a whiney little brat. He broke his phone, his loss", "NTA. If you bought it yourself and had plans to use it, your mom is an asshole for expecting you to loan it", "He has a new tablet let him use his own stuff", "Nta he should have been more responsible, he can bring books or pen and paper or travel games. He is 15 and only doing a 4 hour plane ride. When I was 9 every summer I had to travel by plane to visit my dad by myself because that's when they tighten security at the airports and my parents were not allowed to escort me to my gate. I didn't have a cell phone or tablet and had to deal with layovers so he could have it much worse", "NTA \n\nHe deliberately broke his phone. What\u2019s to say he won\u2019t break your stuff, especially since flying is high stress? \n\nHe can use her phone, read, nap, or do crossword puzzles. 4 hours without electronics won\u2019t kill him.", "NTA - son threw is phone and gets rewarded with a new tablet? Maybe he can read a book or watch the built in screen.", "Why can\u2019t he buy one?", "Exactly. How did people go on plane rides (or boats, or trains) before there were tablets and cell phones?", "Does your mother and brother know they sell these things called \"books\" at the airport and stores? They cost around a tenner and provide somewhere in the region of 20 hours of entertainment. They can also be thrown as hard as you can without breaking and the battery life is almost infinite. Tell him to give that a try, he might even learn something while you watch whatever you want on your own tablet.\n\nEdit: OP, also good on you for actually buying a tablet to practice drawing skills. Keep up the good work!", "Does it ever occur to anyone to read a book?!", "Definitely NTA. I can\u2019t imagine letting my kids get away with this, I\u2019m fact, my daughter did destroy her phone & we refused to replace it. That\u2019s called consequences. You saved & paid for that tablet, it\u2019s yours to decide if you want to lend it out", "NTA\n\n>I should probably add that my mom got him a new tablet before we left. Not a super expensive one but yeah I\u2019m not sure what to think about that one\n\nI don\u2019t understand.  Why doesn\u2019t your brother use that?  Did you ask your mom?  What was her response?\n\nWhy does he need to borrow your tablet (that you\u2019re planning on using) when he has his own?  I\u2019m so confused.", "NTA, he can read a book", "In stead of repairing his phone, i would replace it with a cheap old 3310. That way he can still message and call, but he will feel it since he never knew a world without smart phones.", "Because she doesn't trust him with her phone.", "you're reading too much into it. She probably just insisted to stop his whining.", "We all stared straight ahead for 1-18 hours from take off to landing.", "Ah yes, AITA at its finest, hyperanalysing someones home life based off of a minor incidence and suggesting emancipation."]}
