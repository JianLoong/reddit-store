I'm normally not huge on celebrating my birthday but told them I could use a new pair of Airpods after they asked me a couple of times. Because they're in a different country and not super tech savvy, they just transferred the money to my bank so that I could buy them. Around the same time, my wife was going to the US for a work trip. I asked her if I could order the Airpods from Amazon to her US address because they were significantly cheaper there and she agreed. A couple of days later, we were on a video call (she is in the US by now) and I noticed that she was wearing Airpods during our call. Now, she used to have her own pair of Airpods (which she lost somewhere) but it has been a while since she used them. I asked her if this was my birthday gift to which she nonchalantly said yes. Now, I normally wouldn't mind had it been a t-shirt or some other thing but she knows how much I love technology and love unboxing and tinkering with gadgets. As stupid as it may sound for a full-grown adult, this is also my first pair of AirPods and it is one of the few things I had been really hyped up about. So I kind of flipped out in the moment and she said that she only opened them to test them, just in case there was an issue and they needed to be returned. I asked her why did she not ask me or at the very least unbox it with me on a video call and she just said that it didn't occur to her. She's still on her work trip (will return home this weekend, after two weeks) but she's been using my Airpods on and off for the last 10 days despite the whole conversation. I know that I'll get them as soon as she's back. She also apologized last week and said that she would make up to me but I can't help but feel irritated. It just doesn't feel like a birthday gift anymore and I'm just not excited anymore. I was even considering asking her to keep this pair because she doesn't have one and buy me a 'new' one instead.\n\nAm I being an asshole or overreacting in this situation?\n\nEdit: Definitely wasn't expecting this post to get this much attention.

Just scratches on my brand new club face.\n\nIn fairness, the friend did replace it. He admitted he's a rageaholic on the golf course, and threw my club across a cart path on one hole, causing the damage, after I flipped out upon arriving and realizing it had been used, and damaged!\n\nAnyway, long anecdote all to say that I empathize with you a bit OP, and it's really not cool what your wife did.", "Nah make her buy you new ones.

It has been tough. I would be fine with using the current pair but I can\u2019t help but feel disrespected or at the very least feel like she did not think about how this would affect me. How would you react in such a situation?", "One doesn\u2019t \u2018test\u2019 someone else\u2019s birthday gift by using it for 2 weeks. She wasn\u2019t testing them. If she was, she would have opened them, saw that they worked, then put them back. Instead she used them for two weeks without permission. That\u2019s not a test any way you look at it.", "NO. she is completely out of line & her reaction makes it a million times worse. I don\u2019t forgive her. :)", "This wasn\u2019t just about testing them, but there was reason to test them.  A lot of companies (and just checked, Apple is one of them) make international returns difficult.  If there was a problem with the AirPods, then it would have been a real hassle not to discover that before returning to where they live.\n\nShe still should have asked first.  Many people would care more about them being unopened than that practicality.  Also, I personally find earbuds that others have used gross, so I\u2019d have requested any testing not involve interring them into the ear.", "I think I have the biggest issue with the fact that it was technically a gift that OPs PARENTS gave op the money in order buy. They knew what he wanted as the item, and they funded it. \n\nThis to me is super disrespectful and I\u2019d be pissed my money went to AirPods that my son didn\u2019t even get to open before his partner just decided to steal them.", "How many airpods have been opened and not worked? You could probably round down to 0%"]}
