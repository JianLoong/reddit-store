I'm normally not huge on celebrating my birthday but told them I could use a new pair of Airpods after they asked me a couple of times. Because they're in a different country and not super tech savvy, they just transferred the money to my bank so that I could buy them. Around the same time, my wife was going to the US for a work trip. I asked her if I could order the Airpods from Amazon to her US address because they were significantly cheaper there and she agreed. A couple of days later, we were on a video call (she is in the US by now) and I noticed that she was wearing Airpods during our call. Now, she used to have her own pair of Airpods (which she lost somewhere) but it has been a while since she used them. I asked her if this was my birthday gift to which she nonchalantly said yes. Now, I normally wouldn't mind had it been a t-shirt or some other thing but she knows how much I love technology and love unboxing and tinkering with gadgets. As stupid as it may sound for a full-grown adult, this is also my first pair of AirPods and it is one of the few things I had been really hyped up about. So I kind of flipped out in the moment and she said that she only opened them to test them, just in case there was an issue and they needed to be returned. I asked her why did she not ask me or at the very least unbox it with me on a video call and she just said that it didn't occur to her. She's still on her work trip (will return home after two weeks) but she's been using my Airpods on and off for the last 10 days despite the whole conversation. I know that I'll get them as soon as she's back. She also apologized last week and said that she would make up to me but I can't help but feel irritated. It just doesn't feel like a birthday gift anymore and I'm just not excited anymore.

Just scratches on my brand new club face.\n\nIn fairness, the friend did replace it. He admitted he's a rageaholic on the golf course, and threw my club across a cart path on one hole, causing the damage, after I flipped out upon arriving and realizing it had been used, and damaged!\n\nAnyway, long anecdote all to say that I empathize with you a bit OP, and it's really not cool what your wife did.", "Nah make her buy you new ones.

Make her buy you new ones and or give you the money.", "If she has to open it for customs, fine, open the box. She 100% did not need to use them or go any further than opening the box for customs purposes only.", "This is very clear: She stole your gift. She owes you either a new pair or the money. Do not let her get away with this or it\u2019ll be a lifetime of her helping herself to anything of yours that she decides she wants for herself.", "Wait and see.  Hopefully she will offer to get you a new pair.", "Right, It sounded as if after you got the money you realized your wife would be in the states and could get them cheaper.", "Yes. Not everyone would consider the unboxing of a gift to be as special as you think it is, nor would they necessarily consider that a gift would lose its value just because someone else used it first. They're still new AirPods. I'm sorry you are disappointed but yes, you should let it go.", "It was a joke.", "I would careless but that\u2019s just my autism", "As long as she gave them back I wouldn\u2019t care if my wife used them.  If she broke / lost them, then I\u2019d expect her to either replace them or apologize for losing them.", "Yeah, that wasn't his present that was her present.", "OP please do this. Your Wife STOLE your property. If I get someone a BRAND NEW gift, that gift isn\u2019t supposed to be in used condition before they get the gift.", "Parents sent the money to buy airpods. Realized wife's going to States and they're cheaper there. She agreed to bring them back for me. I ordered them to her US address. She opened them to test and to avoid unnecessary customs, has been using them on and off since.", "Oh goodie, it's my turn to use the classic.\n\nJokes are supposed to be funny.", "Jokes are supposed to be funny. Autism is not in and of itself funny, it can be a reasonably debilitating mental problem.", "yes you said that, repeatedly. I'm thinking bot.", "I think most men have a slight form of autism me included.", "If your good at math probably on the spectrum just a touch. Doesn\u2019t make you bad but I think OCD and other similar things are autistic behaviors misdiagnosed"]}
