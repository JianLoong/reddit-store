We're not friends, but I've never had any problem with them until now.\n\nOne of the girls 'Nancy' got a new job a month ago which requires her to wear a uniform. Since then, Nancy has started using the washer and dryer for her uniform multiple times a week. She comes home, puts the uniform in the washer, and when it's finished it goes into the dryer. As such, the clothes don't go into the dryer until about 10-11pm.\n\nThe problem is that my bedroom is right above the kitchen and the dryer is really noisy. I don't mind it during the day, but it keeps me awake at night. The first time it happened, I let it go but messaged her asking her not to put it on so late during the week. She agreed, but did it again the following week. That time I saw her in the kitchen, explained the problem, and asked her not to do it again. I offered her my drying rack and put it in the kitchen. Again, she said 'yeah no worries'.\n\nA couple of nights ago at 11pm I had just turned off the light when I heard her go downstairs and put on the dryer, before running back upstairs and closing the door. I had a really important meeting super early the next day and was so angry. So I went downstairs, turned off the dryer, and went to sleep peacefully.\n\nWhile I was at work in the morning she sent me an awful message calling me names and saying I had made her go to work in wet clothes and she was going to get pneumonia (it's summer where we are and is very warm at the moment). I told her I was sorry for that but that I had given her multiple warnings and I needed to sleep. I also said I would do the same in the future. She hasn't responded.\n\nSo guys, AITA?", "created_utc": 1685696297, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13y7dit/aita_for_making_my_housemate_go_to_work_in_wet/", "score": 27, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I mean I feel it's a little assholish of you to stop the dryer like that. It's a room share right? You aren't the sole arbitrator of the rules. \n\nIs it possible to switch rooms with the late washer? So she is above the dryer and you can sleep soundly?", "I live in a shared house and we wouldnt dare use the machines past 10. Its just (not so?) common courtesy to me. This sounds like a regular thing, if i were the other person id stress that i had no clean clothes and \"would you mind?\" before using late at night.  \nSidenote. Multiple times a week? Good lord i hope ypu dont share utility bills. Be tempted to let the landlord know", "ESH She's definitely the bigger dick, but turning it off and not telling her is also a dick move.

Guess she fucked around and found out.", "ESH you could\u2019ve went and knocked on her door and asked her to get her clothes out and hang dry them. You wouldn\u2019t want to go to work in wet clothes. She\u2019s definitely the bigger asshole though. I also get off work around 10 and if I need my clothes clean for my shift the next day, I\u2019ll usually do them a couple hours before my shift. It\u2019s also really rude for her to tell you she\u2019s going to stop using the dryer at night, then continue to do it. Maybe she\u2019s just a turd and still won\u2019t listen but I\u2019d try to sit down and have a conversation about it one more time.", "NTA.   She had a reasonable alternative means to dry her uniform and chose not to.", "YTA she is dealing with people's skin all day, her uniform needs a hot wash for hygiene reasons.  \n\nSwap rooms or get some earplugs and don't interfere with her laundry.  \n\nYou sound like a princess.

She is being a dick by continuously doing it, but I\u2019m not sure why you couldn\u2019t just go and confront her asking her to put in on the rack instead of doing this to her? This is going to be a horrible environment for you both to live in as there will be so much tension. Can\u2019t she get her work to give e.g. three more uniforms and wait till her day off in the morning to sort this out and only wash it once during the working week?

She could have used the drying rack, as you offered.", "NTA you asked her multiple to stop and she did not listen\nShould just asked to switch rooms so when she wants the washer and the dryer she has to hear it all night", "NTA - enough warnings and asks have been given.

I love to blast music in the shower, but I don't do it because the bathroom is right next to the other girls room and that would be inconsiderate.", "And why so ? Why after asking 3 times to stop using the dryer when she sleep, should she borrow herself to warn her roomates that she ll stop the dryer ? \n\nSo it mind you that her roomates have to go to work with wet clothes (because she did not use the dryer earlier, don't forget she knews well enough that her roomates could not sleep !)

And getting to the bottom on why this is seemingly the only time she can wash and dry her clothes and why it takes so long.", "Is her job rather dirty that her uniform is heavily soiled? So much that it requires a considerable wash time? \n\nIs there any other time it could be washed?\n\nAlso is there anything that could be done to help with noise such as insulation foam above the laundry room?", "You say you have to be mindful of room mates, but your post is about how you caused your room mate to have to work in a wet uniform.

It doesn't completely dry and feels damp and uncomfortable all day.", "Based on the original post, sounds like this is happening once a week or so. Not nightly.", "Oh yes it fucking is. Do you have any idea the disgusting shit beauticians do? Filing skin off people's feet, cleaning under their fingernails and toenails. Your uniform gets covered in little flakes of biowaste all day long.", "Hmm the chemicals they use can be quite smelly and maybe difficult to clean. \n\nHonestly I'd have a roomie meeting and try to get her to compromise rather than just dictating rules (however fair or reasonable) \n\nIts really odd she works so late and has no time to wash her clothes in the morning. Or they take so long to dry. It's what an apron, pants, and shirt right  ?", "Hey hairdresser here\n\nYes it is. Just not in the general sense. Depending on what exactly she does because people will say beautician for a lot of things. \n\nThere are chemicals, skin flakes (body,scalp,feet), hair gets EVERYWHERE, toe nails. \n\nThen you sweat. Your clothes get rank and they NEED to be clean. You generally work in someone's personal bubble..\n\nThe only thing I wear twice before washing are my jeans. Because all of my clients have clean hair before I start, and my services are limited, but they get itchy.\n\n\nEdit: ESH"]}
