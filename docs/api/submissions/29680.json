Wanted to go to a movie coming out.My mother would not take my sister and her friends due to it being a Horror movie and her religious beliefs. Growing up my mother had some strong views on Halloween and horror movies. Specifically, that as Christians watching horror movies will open portals and doorways for demons to enter. \n My sister asked me if i would take her friends to the movies to see this movie. I told her yes, however, there are a few rules. \nI would preorder the 5 tickets, however, their parents will need to pay me back. I do not have the extra money to cover you and me and them. rule 2: i cannot afford to feed all ya. I need them to buy their own snacks. And if you all want to stop by fastfood. then they will need to cover that too.  \n2 of the friend's parents cash app me that day, and said they would be sending money with them for snacks and dinner, as we won't be home until Midnight. \nMy sister has this one friend. T, who never pays for anything.  T's Mother contacted me and told me that she would not be sending me money for T to go. I informed her mother that I would not punish T over her mother's irresponsibility.  If she is dressed and ready with the girls i would still take her>.she had known for 25 days she was going. That i do not have the funds to pay to feed her child and it is not my responsibility. \nI told my sister to inform T I would still take her to the movies but i cannot pay for her snacks or dinner. That i will eat the $16 movie tickets but ic an not afford the $30 ish dollars per child to get popcorn and soda and to feed them dinner. \nMy parents have fed this child more than once because her parents will not pay them back or will not send money to group things like this.  My parents don't believe in punishing the child. \n The child's mother said, your parents will not send her back hungry. I informed her, no my parent won't, however, my mother isnt taking her child to the movies, I am , and that mother religiously does not believe in Horror movies.  That her daughter will be returned hungry if it is my responsibility to feed her i told her almost a month ago i could not budget it. Now, with that said I may be able to pay for something small at the fast food place. Maybe like 10 dollars to feed her. but i cannot feed her at both dinner and the movies i just cant.I then told T Mom that everyone always covers her child and it is not their job. She knew for a month. what the plan is cause i am ocd and i make a plan with times for having other people kids", "created_utc": 1698264754, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17gdvla/aita_for_telling_my_sisters_friends_parents_i/", "score": 63, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Yeah, I don\u2019t envy you! You\u2019re not the asshole. This is about money, not kindness. You\u2019ve outright told these people that you can\u2019t afford to pay extra for \u201cT.\u201d If T\u2019s parents can\u2019t even afford to send their daughter, *they* should have the good grace to come up with another solution (either they can send their daughter with a pocket full of snacks, not send her at all, or offer something else for the friends to do together). \n\nNTA.", "NTA - I feel for the kid but it\u2019s not your job to bankroll other peoples children. Also, the gall of that mother to expect everyone else to pay for her child to be involved. She has clearly worked out a system and everyone else is just feeding into it by paying for T.", "NTA. But you shouldn\u2019t have taken her. Better to just lose the money than to gain this headache. And, honestly, better to stop enabling her shitty parents.", "Nta not your children.  Her mom is a huge ahole. You should have refused to take the friend. Not your job to buy her ticket. Do it once and her mom will expect you to pay every time. People will walk all over you and use you if you let them. Don't let them.", "NTA- you\u2019re very kind to take your sister and her friends, front the money for them, and then offer to take T even though she\u2019s not paying. I feel really bad for T because her mother is making things awkward and damaging her social life over giving her daughter $20 for a movie. \nYou don\u2019t have to pay, at all. But, you planning to have $10 for something small will probably mean the world to T. She will get to be included and not feel left out if you\u2019re all getting food. It\u2019s very likely she knows her mother is not being fair and will not ask for much. If you send me your cashapp i can send you a little something honestly.", "Nta\n\nYou're already going above and beyond by buying her ticket. Tell her and her mom the day before that she should pack herself a couple sandwiches to eat in the car.", "Yikes. I don\u2019t wanna punish the child either but those parents are never going to learn if everyone keeps paying for stuff\u2026\n\nNTA but I wish there was a better solution to this. \n\nHave your sister tell her friend to eat at home before you go. How old are you? Why are you even the one purchasing tickets for these kids? I feel like their parents should\u2019ve.", "Demons will come if you watch a horror movie.  The world would be over run by demons if this was true.  Your mom is nuts.", "Look, girl, that family doesn't have any money. They don't have it.\n\nYou are really doing the most with $30 popcorns or $10 fast food.\n\nHere's how you Mom: you bring a big ass purse and you sneak in waters that you keep in the back of your car for any occasion. These are the cheapest store brand waters (or cans of sparkling water these days). You also bring in one 5$ bag of Halloween candies to share. OR sneak mini bags of popcorn or pretzels or chips.\n\nThen you eat those yourself and cackle at having saved yourself 24$ vs buying at the counter, and you slip a drink and some snacks to the poor girl.\n\nYes, theaters are hurting and it's not strictly by the book to bring in your own stuff but if most of the girls are hitting concessions, you guys are fine.\n\nYou have to decide your values. Is it inclusion or everyone participates in capitalism to the fullest extent. Cause if it costs $50 for one teen to go out with her friends group one time, most people will find themselves excluded.", "ESH. Mostly her parents. But. You shouldn\u2019t have taken her because that\u2019s so awful for her to sit there while everyone else is eating and she\u2019s hungry.

She even tells OP that the parents never send T home hungry. So T's mom KNOWS what happens and doesn't care. Also doesn't care how this affects T. I would be embarrassed if my parents never gave me any money to do things and I had to rely on friends' generosity all the time.", "I appreciate that.  My mother is giving me 10 dollars to help me cover T getting food. Mom can't stand the idea of her going hungry. Movie is Friday,  so Mom and me have some time to plan.  It just blew up today while i was on my lunch break at work.  I think Mom will cover everything since I can't. Orvthats the current plan.  After a few hours of talking with mom.", "I am f 30, the kids are all 15. I'm the oldest of my siblings, and my sister is the baby. 2 of 3 friends ready paid me back. Movies rated R so they need an adult. All parents agreed if they wanted to go they had to have someone's gardian agree. Well, my sister asked me cause I'm  \"Cool\".  And mom doesn't do horror movies. \nI ordered the tickets when they went on pre-sale cause the girls wanted to go and they worried it would sale.

You are very kind, but she will absolutely take that detail and run with it. It would help T in the long run for her mom to have a reality check.", "NTA for T, you have now shown T's mom you will back down and pay for her child's movie ticket and provide food.", "Honestly.. you might need to force Ts mom to hold up her deal. Even if that means \u201cpunishing the child\u201d. She really needs to learn not to take advantage of peoples kindness. And if you have someone else who could buy the ticket maybe that\u2019d be best. Idk it\u2019s crappy either way but it wouldn\u2019t be you punishing the child.. at the end of the day it\u2019s Ts moms fault", "The mother is a user and absolutely screwing up her child. Not okay.", "I am not. As far as T and her mother know I am staying with what I said. I haven't even told my sister. BUT  I'm seeing if for once being told her child will go without means she will stop. And actually care enough to feed her child.", "Very true.. I'll post an update Saturday once we see how everyt plays out.", "Please update us how it goes. I think you\u2019re handling it so well. I really hope this mother will be a mother for once.", "She won't stop by being \"told\". Because there had never been follow through. Even now, your mom is stepping up to cover for T's parent, which will absolutely convince T's parent that she can always get away with this regardless of what you or anyone else says. Cause she's got nice people figured out. Nobody is going to punish or deprive T jut because her parent is an AH. And I suspect that even if less nice people did, AH parent won't care cause she is a narcissist. \n\nI suppose T will someday go LC or NC with her grifting parent from the constant humiliation.", "I will saturday!"]}
