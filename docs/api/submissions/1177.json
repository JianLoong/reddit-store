You are close to the age that you can take care of yourself.   Leaving that toxic environment as soon as you can might be the best way to end the abuse.   Perhaps there is a family member that is aware of your situation that might be willing to take you in.   Child services might be able to help you.  If none of these ideas appeal to you then don't pursue them.   Another option might be to avoid the argument by saying \"I'm sorry\" immediately.   It doesn't matter whether you mean it or not.   It's what they want to hear and might get them off of you back.   Good luck!", "I'm afraid you need to start emotionally distancing yourself from them, because this is not a healthy situation", "The problem with parents like yours is they leave you feeling like you are wrong even when you aren't. You let the dog out but sometimes dogs, like himans, get caught short or misjudge. She suddenly needed to go and hey-ho. It happens. Does that make you negligent? Not at all. When you get out of the toxic environment you're in try to get some therapy to help you navigate reasonable expectations in a relationship.

You took care of the dog properly, but when the dog pooped on the floor, your parents called you a liar and called you irresponsible. You explained that neither of those was true, and they doubled down. Those are not the actions of people who respect you. Those are the actions of people who want to control you, and they know that in a couple of years you'll be able to walk out that door, so they're desperate to maintain that control as best they can.", "Question :\n\nDo you consider \"*letting dog into the backyard*\" as a walk?", "no those are two different things"]}
