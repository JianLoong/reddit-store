If she was living on her own she would have to do much more than this. \nIf its too much to ask her to look after laundry, if she finds that too personal,  she can trade some of the house cleaners duties for that one. \nI'd maybe get the free rental terms in writing.

IF she is being that sick she can go to her dr and get medication to tame it.\n\nIf she cannot conduct herself with grace in your place and keeps up the passive aggressive comments - then this situation is not going to work out for you to keep offering a place to stay.

YTA.", "NAH\n\nI think you brought up a reasonable issue in a reasonable way.  Her reaction was not chill ... but I have to cut her some slack because (1) she's pregnant and probably quite uncomfortable, and (2) I think she is stressed out about what the hell is happening in her life.  And (3) you DID mention paying for everything, which is a not-so-subtle reminder that since you're supporting her she needs to mind what you say.  \n\nBTW, something tells me you might have unreasonable expectations for how long \"getting back on her feet\" is going to take.  Like, isn't it going to only be harder to land a new job from here as her pregnancy gets more advanced?  I think it's kind of you to take her in but if you're going to kick her out in the next couple of months she should know that now.", "I'm going to go against the grain here and say YTA.\n\nIt's nice that you offered your house to your sister who has fallen on hard times, and fair of you to ask her to clean up after herself and participate in household chores. But I think setting \"conditions\" on her to wash *your* dishes, clean *your* clothes, and cook food for *you* (and wash all those dishes being used for your food) is just an awful way to treat someone. That's not you doing her a favor - that's you taking advantage of her situation to get a free live-in cook/maid. \n\nDo you do *any* of your own cooking/chores now that she's there, or do you really expect her to do it all? She doesn't have a direct reason to call you sexist, but I do wonder if you were helping out a male friend/relative by offering them your home, would you also put these cooking/cleaning/laundry conditions set on them as well? \n\nI also noticed that you \"hit your limit\" by coming home and seeing *one* single dish in the sink, and that you've been frustrated by seeing her \"lunch dishes\" when you come home - which would only be a few hours after lunch. If she has periods of nausea that last a few hours, that doesn't even give her time to just do them after she recovers. I'm guessing she's telling the truth about them causing nausea, since it sounds like she's doing everything else you asked. I'd suggest you switch one of your chores with her and take over the dishes since that's the one chore that she can't physically do without being sick - but that assumes you have chores to swap with her in the first place.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

While pregnant.", "The sexism comes in where he had to begin his story with the part about her getting pregnant with the unknown baby daddy and how her job wasn't good enough. Then, she is expected to clean up after him and cook for him and do his clothes. Basically, she is supposed to be the other maid for when the other has days off. He offered for her to live with him and she thought he cared and wanted to help because she is having a difficult pregnancy, but instead he sounds like one of those men who talk their wives into being stay at home moms and then come home everyday and ask her what she even did all day  and then expect her to be the one who does everything all the time because he gets paid for the 8 hrs of work that he does (but is only productive for 3-4 hours of the day and gets breaks and weekends/holidays off), while she works 24hrs a day 7 days a week and isn't appreciated at all. He literally took 3 paragraphs to make her look bad before leading into his current issue with her. If he had the man flu and was vomiting for a couple of days, he wouldn't clean anything. He would lay in bed acting like he's dying and ask her to do shit for him. She's nauseous and actively vomiting due to pregnancy, but that doesn't count because she's a WOMAN and women are just expected to still do everything while pregnant. Not all pregnancies are easy just because most women can get pregnant. Some pregnancies are dangerous and extremely painful. He wants his sister to do stay at home wife duties minus the sex because she is a woman and he pays the bills. He would not ask his brother or another man to do his laundry or clean up after him or cook for him", "Ok, I understand. Thanks for the clarification.", "And just their dishes at that!", "No, it isn't a gender thing to me, but it seems to be to OP. I think it's unreasonable to expect his sister to do *his* laundry. They are siblings. They should each be responsible for their own laundry.  And I have no problem with the expectation she clean up after *herself.* But it was dishes from *lunch*. We aren't talking about dishes being unclean for *days.*  And she had a valid reason why she hadn't cleaned them yet. \n\nThis isn't a romantic relationship where they have come to an agreement about finances and chores. This is a sibling helping out their sibling. And she held up her end of this unreasonable agreement for almost three weeks before she became too sick to keep it up.
