Etc.\n\nWe made a group chat after 3 months of knowing each other and we chatted. I jokingly flirted with him Which I always do. I partially thought if it would be a problem or If she would get jealous. I mean if she gets jealous that means she has to have some sort of interest in him? It worked like some sort of magic. She was clearly jealous and even privately asked to me to stop flirting with him politely. I just gave the excuse \u201cI just want to practice flirting. It's not like I like him or something.\u201d And she replied with \u201cStop it. Stop flirting with him if you want to practice. Practice on me.\u201d I thought she liked him and I signaled my friend to confess.\n\nBut before any of that happened. She had called me to meet her and I agreed. I called my friend too asking if he was ready for the hang out and he was confused. I thought maybe she forgot to invite him so I did it. As we got there she was waiting and smiled at me but then she was confused when she looked at my friend but she didn't say anything. She told me that she needed to tell me something in private and that it's really important. I got worried so I agreed immediately. She said it's a 'girls problem' so my friend couldn't come.\n\nI followed her and then she stopped and...she confessed her feelings...for me. She liked me. I was so baffled that I just stared at her thinking she was joking but I said I will think about it. She smiled and said that atleast she didn't get rejected. I am not sure how to approach this with my friend. I know he is going to get hurt and I hate that it's because of me.

Did you actually befriend this girl solely because your M friend asked you to. Did you keep talking to her solely for his sake? Did you ever tell her that that was what was going on? Is any part of your and her relationship actually real? At best, you've actually build a proper friendship, even if its beginning seems kinda shady. But at worst it could be seen as pure manipulation of another person (F friend) for the sake of a third person (M friend). Either way, I think you need to level with this girl and discuss what your friendship is (give the poor girl an answer already!), *without* any reference to what your M friend might or might not think. It's a sucky situation for him either way, yes, but that's no reason to turn it into a sucky(/-ier) situation for her, too.", "YTA for the weird thing where you flirted with him just to see if she'd get jealous.

That would just be hurtful to her and make her think that any bonding between the two of you was fake, which, based of how you speak of the relationship, doesn\u2019t seem to be the case. It sounds like you really do care for her and enjoy the friendship that truly grew between the two of you, not that you were pretending all along just to reach the end goal of hooking her up with the guy who likes her.

At least this way they can share that they approached them to get to know them for one reason, but are happy they had so much in common the original reason became eclipsed by their connection. One way or another the truth will come out and it's best that the other person hears it from OP than from the friend if he is not understanding of the situation.", "There\u2019s nothing to think about if you are not attracted to girls.
