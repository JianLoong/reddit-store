While there is nothing wrong w asking her to keep an eye on him while you are right there (as long as it isnt often/habit) but i got a feeling that you both do it far more than you realize. Shes only 8. But your husband is a major ah. He seriously has the nerve to call you out then do far worse? Instead of apologizing, he doubled down? Nope. Personally, my husband wouldn't have said a word if the 8 yr old was keeping an eye on her in the same room while i picked up, because its far safer than leaving the child unattended. That, and he knows & trusts that i would never do anything to endanger our child. But to call you on it then turn around & allow them alone on the other side of the house, no supervision, you cant hear them, he didnt tell you so you can pop in & check on them and yet thats perfectly acceptable for him?!? Maybe its just me, i have no patience for ppl like this. Its all fine & good as long as it benefits him. So from now on, any time you need to pick stuff up, clean, shower, etc, make him come watch the baby since its so unsafe.

I understand not leaving her alone with the baby while you run errands, but watching him while your busy for 20/30 mins is good for her.

Ask the librarian to help you search. Look for organizations that might be able to help you. Also research divorce attorneys (ones familiar with abuse), find a good one.

Lasts several months. Worked great for someone i knew. No worries about birth control pills and being sabotage. \n\nDon't warn him you're leaving when you're ready, just do it, maybe domestic violence organizations can help you find a way out. Maybe they have housing for you and the kids. Find out what resources they have to help.
