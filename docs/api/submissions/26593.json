While there is nothing wrong w asking her to keep an eye on him while you are right there (as long as it isnt often/habit) but i got a feeling that you both do it far more than you realize. Shes only 8. But your husband is a major ah. He seriously has the nerve to call you out then do far worse? Instead of apologizing, he doubled down? Nope. Personally, my husband wouldn't have said a word if the 8 yr old was keeping an eye on her in the same room while i picked up, because its far safer than leaving the child unattended. That, and he knows & trusts that i would never do anything to endanger our child. But to call you on it then turn around & allow them alone on the other side of the house, no supervision, you cant hear them, he didnt tell you so you can pop in & check on them and yet thats perfectly acceptable for him?!? Maybe its just me, i have no patience for ppl like this. Its all fine & good as long as it benefits him. So from now on, any time you need to pick stuff up, clean, shower, etc, make him come watch the baby since its so unsafe.
