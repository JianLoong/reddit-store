I hope you're trolling, but I also think you're not.\n\nFirst of all, successful content creators do make pretty insane amounts of money.\n\nAll that aside, if she \"doesn't use social media for herself\", it sounds like she is a social media manager for a company, not even an influencer. Like, she's the person sending out official tweets and making the Facebook posts for a company, which is *definitely* a \"real job\".", "YTA. You misunderstood how she meant when she said it's what she does and then offered your assumption that it must be low-paid or low-status. Instead, you should have tried to stick to the spirit of your original question and learn what it is that she does.", "Let\u2019s be honest, working construction is really just a hobby too right? I mean, you go out there and tinker around with tools and stuff, and I bet you\u2019ve even had a couple of projects you were proud of too! It\u2019s super cute that you found a way to make some side money doing your little hobby, but you probably could have gotten a real job.\n\n\nIt\u2019s really stupid to put down someone else\u2019s line of work just because it isn\u2019t for you, isn\u2019t it? YTA", "YTA\n\nNot for using the word hobby,that is an honest mistake. \n\nNo, what you did was used your closed mind to devalue her life choices. Something you have subsequently confirmed with your statement about your own line of work and relative stress. \n\nYou said \u201cit can\u2019t really pay that much\u201d which is rude and dismissive. You could have said \u201cI did not know that was a thing, tell me more, does it allow you to live comfortably?\u201d which asks the same question but wrapped in curiosity.", "YTA\n\nYou insulted her at least three times.  You asked her work, she told you.  You called it a hobby (1), then she explained her professional training, to which you questioned why she would bother (2).  And then you went even further to claim she must be in the poor house due to her choice in career (3) all because you can\u2019t keep up with modern industry.", "YTA. Social Media Manager is a very real job position. They get paychecks and everything. It\u2019s really great.\n\nI can\u2019t tell from your post if she is a content creator on her own or working for a company doing social media management or advertising, but either or both are very real careers.", "YTA but this sounds very trollish.

I call shenanigans.", "YTA. You clearly knew it was her job since that was what you were asking her, and your response was pretty dismissive.

Super condescending", "YTA condescending and rude much? You had no idea what you were talking about and you tried to make her feel like a stupid little girl. I distrust that you didn't mean to offend. YOu didn't care if you offended was more like it and now that other people care, you are acting all innocent and bewildered when you know telling someone that their job is just a hobby and that they can't possibly make a living at it when they obvious are is fucking rude. You're actually an exponential asshole. ETA: her work can't be hard as mine because I work in the weather. So I am big man and I am stressed. I'm going to say right here that you're  also a misogynist. You probably don't do any of the mental load or house work in your own house. Your poor wife probably does everything.", "YTA.

You did mean to offend people and you're upset people called you out.", "YTA. It's fine to be ignorant, but it's not fine to be incurious. When she said she did social media, rather than assuming it had to be a hobby because you didn't understand what that meant, you could have asked her follow up questions to help you understand what she actually did.", "So you weren't wrong at the start, when you assumed she was talking about a hobby and not a job. But you became TA when you doubled down when she clarified. You were condescending and belittled her profession (and yes, it is a profession. Most companies have social media experts now, and they're absolutely necessary in marketing departments everywhere.) You should have kept up with polite inquiries, apologized for your assumption, and let her tell you about her job. Instead, you decided to be rude and insult her, and she did the right thing in separating herself from you instead of starting an argument. YTA, and owe her an apology.", "YTA.

It doesn't matter what *you* do for a living - you devalued her profession, which was totally uncalled for. YTA.", "NTA.  You\u2019re getting beat up bad but you didn't know what she meant and people are allowed to learn.  She could have used her words to explain\u2026Instead she huffed & puffed & pouted.  I don\u2019t think you were intentionally mean spirited", "Eh, I'm going to say ESH. I, too, work in communications and the vast majority of what I do is social media. It's a tough one to explain to anyone older than 50. How do you make money on that? People pay for that? Wait, if you hate it then why do you have it? So I get it. But there's a way to show interest and be curious without being demeaning, and her reaction would indicate you were being more dismissive than curious with your questions. In the off-chance you weren't being dismissive, she should have stuck around and educated you. But yeah, don't dismiss people's careers just because you don't understand them.", "Boomer", "NTA. Hey, man, it sounds like things got a bit heated there, but I don't think you're the asshole in this situation. It seems like a misunderstanding between you and your niece.\r  \n\r  \nYou asked your niece what she does, and when she mentioned social media, you called it an interesting hobby. From your perspective, you probably didn't realize that she considers it her job and went to college for it. It's understandable that she got defensive about it, as it's something she's passionate about and takes seriously.\r  \n\r  \nHowever, it's also important to note that you didn't mean any harm or intend to offend her. You were just trying to engage in conversation and show interest in her life. It's unfortunate that things escalated, and your son and wife's reactions might have made you feel attacked.\r  \n\r  \nIn hindsight, it would have been better to ask more open-ended questions or express interest in her career choice, rather than labeling it as a hobby. That way, you could have better understood her perspective and avoided any unintentional condescension.\r  \n\r  \nMaybe take the opportunity to talk to your niece privately, apologize for the misunderstanding, and express that you genuinely want to learn more about her work and support her endeavors.\r In the end, it's about having a respectful conversation and finding common ground.   \n\n\nGood luck, man, and I hope things can be smoothed over with your niece.", "YTA -- clearly you made a mistake at the beginning but you doubled down once she told you it was her job and continued to doubt her openly.\n\nJOBS HAVE CHANGED.\n\nEveryone is attacking you because you were incredibly rude about someone else's job.", "It really depends on how you said it.

Although your niece's reaction to her job being belittled is valid, she's also kind of the asshole for throwing a fit instead of trying to explain or enlighten you about it. \n\nThe divide in generations is evident, but to avoid conflict with your kids or even your relatives who are younger, you should try being more open-minded to their mindsets (and of course, them to yours as well) and provide some wisdom instead of belittle their paths in life.", "For a lot of people it's a hobby.

I was so mad that he was belittling all the hard work i had done, and i felt so insignificant.

They both probably grew up in different times when technology and the internet was expanding. OP could have grown up in an era where social media was not that big or was considered just  not viable as a lasting job which would explain OP thinking that niece's job in social media is \"just a hobby\". OP's mindset compared to the niece's about social media being a good paying job could very well be attributed to the differences in their generation's outlook on the internet.\n\nYeah, of course, older people use social media, but just because they use it doesn't mean they think the people who work in that industry are paid high salaries compared to traditional blue collared work.", "OP's \"rude and condescending\" behavior could be due to him being of an older generation who has had different views on social media growing up compared to the niece's.
