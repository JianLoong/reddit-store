I hope you're trolling, but I also think you're not.\n\nFirst of all, successful content creators do make pretty insane amounts of money.\n\nAll that aside, if she \"doesn't use social media for herself\", it sounds like she is a social media manager for a company, not even an influencer. Like, she's the person sending out official tweets and making the Facebook posts for a company, which is *definitely* a \"real job\".", "YTA. You misunderstood how she meant when she said it's what she does and then offered your assumption that it must be low-paid or low-status.

I mean, you go out there and tinker around with tools and stuff, and I bet you\u2019ve even had a couple of projects you were proud of too!

Something you have subsequently confirmed with your statement about your own line of work and relative stress. \n\nYou said \u201cit can\u2019t really pay that much\u201d which is rude and dismissive. You could have said \u201cI did not know that was a thing, tell me more, does it allow you to live comfortably?\u201d which asks the same question but wrapped in curiosity.", "YTA\n\nYou insulted her at least three times.

But you became TA when you doubled down when she clarified. You were condescending and belittled her profession (and yes, it is a profession. Most companies have social media experts now, and they're absolutely necessary in marketing departments everywhere.) You should have kept up with polite inquiries, apologized for your assumption, and let her tell you about her job.

It's a tough one to explain to anyone older than 50. How do you make money on that? People pay for that? Wait, if you hate it then why do you have it? So I get it. But there's a way to show interest and be curious without being demeaning, and her reaction would indicate you were being more dismissive than curious with your questions.

From your perspective, you probably didn't realize that she considers it her job and went to college for it. It's understandable that she got defensive about it, as it's something she's passionate about and takes seriously.\r  \n\r  \nHowever, it's also important to note that you didn't mean any harm or intend to offend her.

It's unfortunate that things escalated, and your son and wife's reactions might have made you feel attacked.\r  \n\r  \nIn hindsight, it would have been better to ask more open-ended questions or express interest in her career choice, rather than labeling it as a hobby. That way, you could have better understood her perspective and avoided any unintentional condescension.\r  \n\r  \nMaybe take the opportunity to talk to your niece privately, apologize for the misunderstanding, and express that you genuinely want to learn more about her work and support her endeavors.\r In the end, it's about having a respectful conversation and finding common ground.   \n\n\nGood luck, man, and I hope things can be smoothed over with your niece.", "YTA -- clearly you made a mistake at the beginning but you doubled down once she told you it was her job and continued to doubt her openly.\n\nJOBS HAVE CHANGED.\n\nEveryone is attacking you because you were incredibly rude about someone else's job.", "It really depends on how you said it.
