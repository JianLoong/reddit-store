It is unhealthy for their entire family, including the kids. And above all, its unhealthy for your dog.\n\nWhen they decided to get rid of their dog, they chose as well to get rid if all rights to that dog.\n\nI wonder how the dog is with all this. How is the dog meant to let go of his old life if you keep taking him back?\n\nSince you are moving interstate, the time has come for all to accept the dog is not coming back. I would refuse to take him again.\n\nDo what you need prepping for your move, and if they harass you again, block their number.\n\nTell them they need to let go.

Otherwise, this transaction is final.  And then if you need to, block them.  (After reading more comments, I agree.

If they were so invested, they'd be willing to meet you halfway. If they're not that invested, then it's definitely okay to say no. If they are willing to make the effort, and you don't, then you'd be the AH. Most people love and feel connected to their pets, rehoming is a hard thing to do. I'd want to be able to see my dog one last time too. I'm sure you'd feel the same. The dog might be confused, but that's not a great justification for refusing just one more visit. Let them know that if they want this, it's their turn to come to you. Apart from the drive and gas money, one last visit isn't going to cost you much.", "NTA  It's your dog now.

Hell, even if it was convenient, it\u2019s still your right to say no.", "Postage is expensive where I live and I'm not spending $40 in postage when I can take the dog for a drive at least and see new sights. The muzzle is huge, the dog is a german shepherd and large even for his breed. You're right he was whining a lot after seeing the family the last time and its cruel. It really is too confusing for him", "I doubt it cos the 6 or 7 yo girl was cringing and shying away from the dog the whole time and the woman told me 'she hates his barks'or something like that. I don't even know why she wants the kids to see it? Maybe cos the 10 yo hasn't seen it yet? This was the first time meeting the woman. Usually I talk to her husband who I personally bought the dog from and changed microchip ownership from, who was way into training, walking and spending time with the dog (he told me he bought it and his wife wasn't fond of it as much and kept it away from the kids). But now the woman says she wants her kids to see the dog?? Something smells fishy. But the man was straight with me the entire time. Maybe I'll message him instead of the wife", "They asked me if I was using the muzzle and collar and I truthfully said no as hes a very well behaved dog BUT I do  want to keep it as I'm thinking of adopting more dogs and you never know. The reason why I thought I'd just give them back was because they slashed the price from $1000 to $650 as they needed to get rid of the dog soon. I figured with $350 saved, I could afford to give back the collar and muzzle and get new ones", "Very good point. It's the first time I've gotten a dog where  previous owners kept in contact", "Get fucked", "It might make him worry that you\u2019re returning him to them.

I'd simply email them that as agreed by both parties they transferred all ownership of the dog, collars, muzzles, toys, etc upon exchange of money that you didn't need to give them back anything. However you chose to give them the collar and muzzle out of the kindness of your heart. The new muzzle was purchased to fit your dog, so if that doesn't fit the other dog it's unlikely the old muzzle will fit either. They've actually benefitted by getting a brand new muzzle instead of an old one, and they can sell that one to buy one that will fit. If they want to come to your house to buy the old muzzle off you it will be $, and you will conduct the sale outside your home for security reasons. If they want to come they must come on this date, otherwise you won't be there.", "That's fair enough but they still should have collected it from you or paid for postage", "100% I'm going to just tell them I'm sorry I don't have no more time", "This is the way.

Just say no or better still ignore any calls or messages.that dog is now yours", "If they really want anything they should come over themselves", "NTA, you've done waaaay more than I ever would. If they wanted to see the dog, they should come to you, not the other way around especially since they are an hour away!! Entitled much?!! You don't owe them anything and don't bother communicating with then anymore. Life goes on. Have a great move!", "Yup. You could offer for them to come meet you, if youre feeling very generous.\n\nOffer to mail the muzzle if you dont need ot and they transfer you postage in advance.", "NTA. You can ship the stuff COD. If they want to see the dog so badly they can make the effort. \n\nSounds like they might try to take the dog back. Whole thing sounds fishy.", "NTA. Just block them and move. Don't let them know where you are moving.", "NTA.  Tell them they can come to your house on X date at Y time and get the muzzle and see the dog.  If that doesn't work for them, sorry, you are moving and cannot help them.  Then block them. Make sure any documentation has you as the owner of the dog, chip, etc", "NTA why are you pandering to these people? It\u2019s your dog now, stop replying to them your business with them is now complete you and your pupper enjoy your life together!", "Nta. Cars and roads travel in two directions (well more then that really) tell them if they want to see the dog they can drive to you and swap the muzzle. But you have neither the time or money (gas prices) to make a 3rd last goodbye trip.", "NTA.\n\nYou've already done a lot more than you had to do... which frankly I'm not sure why you did anyway.", "I know this is unlikely, but I wonder if they were using her fear of the dog to control her.  By bringing the dog back, you may be reinforcing an idea that the dog isn't as gone as she thinks it is. Make the dog really gone. Don't meet with them again.", "OP, please block them. You bought the dog + supplies. They need to stop."]}
