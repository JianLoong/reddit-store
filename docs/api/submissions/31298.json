In fact if tell wife that until her parents apologize for their reaction they don\u2019t get to meet your child, or at very least have any alone time with her at all. As in if they are holding her they must be within five feet of one of you so you can remove her the instant they do or say anything inappropriate. There also needs to be a discussion if you\u2019re planning on more children that if you have a boy they MUST treat the kids the same or they won\u2019t be allowed to see them at all.
