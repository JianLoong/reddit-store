She is also her dad's best friend. Neither boy wants anything to do with sports. \nIt's fair to hope for a certain gender, sure.

Your own attitude is exactly as it should be, so I wish you and your wife all the best with your new tiny person.\n\nI think it's beyond rude to go to a gender reveal when you \\*care\\* so desperately about the outcome.

This implies they did the same to your wife.", "NTA.  You can't comfort them - they want what they want and they are not going to get it.  I concur with you that they should be happy about getting a grandchild, no need to sympathize with them because it's not going to be a boy.  \n\nMaybe after they have some time to process this they will change their attitudes.

Sadly I suspect they will be cold towards your daughter when she is born, and if your next child is a boy watch them ignore your daughter and favour your son.\n\nI expect your parents are ecstatic at a new child in the family.\n\nYour MIL,FIL and wife are AH's", "NTA - although gender disappointment is a real thing, for grandparents to be so self-absorbed as to not even bother trying to see some positives in the existence of their grandchild is pretty crappy.

Can\u2019t wait for their reaction when you buy your daughter her first football/tool set/toy car!", "NTA\n\nThis is *exactly* why I hate gender reveal parties. Not even about them maybe being trans, it's the extreme pushing of gender roles that's infuriating.", "NTA!!!!! Wow I'm sorry your inlaws suck.  They should be happy. Getting that upset about something NO ONE has control of is just childish.\n\nA healthy baby is so much more important than gender. I'm afraid I would have asked \"Would you be happy if it was sickly boy baby?\" \n\nAgain, I'm sorry you have deal with them and that your wife doesn't have your back. That sucks.", "NTA. What a pair of miserable old people. They can comfort themselves out of your party and all the way home.", "NTA. Your in-laws need to grow up a little.", "Holy shit Nta nta nta", "Wow!! You should tell \u201cGRANDMA\u201d that the gender of the first grandkid is determined by the egg sack of daughters mom\u2026if they are that stupid\u2026.well!!!!", "NTA. I would go so far as to say that them dumping their \"disappointment\" on you is insensitive and extremely rude. The audacity! How dare they?", "NTA. It's not your responsibility to comfort your in-laws for their disappointment in the gender of your child. They should be grateful and happy that they are getting a grandchild. Gender doesn't determine the love and joy that a child brings to a family.", "NTA\n\nA MIL will always find a way to make the day about her. What an ass she is.", "NTA", "Its absolutely disrespectful and unkind to be disappointed and cry at someones gender reveal party because THEY didnt get what THEY wanted. The feelings they have might be valid because feelings are feelings but to act it out that way is absolutely unhinged in my opinion. They expect you to console someone who is SO disappointed about that you don\u2019t have what they want that they cry? Its such an insult to the child in my opinion NTA obviously and your arguments (with cars and girls) sound like you\u2018ll be a good and accepting father!", "NTA- And your wife getting mad at you for HER parents being so miserable about their grandchild's gender makes her an AH too. There's no reason to comfort them for sexism.\n\nThe child is healthy and will be happy and that's all that matters. Also, the way you talk, I can tell the child will have an amazing, supportive dad.", "Wow. That's some 19th century thinking of your IL's. \n\nMy granddaughter loves helping her daddy fix the car. \n\nNTA", "Your ILs are sexist assholes, and your wife didn't fall far from the sexist asshole tree, herself. You, however, will be a good father and are NTA.", "Comfort them for what? Having a healthy beautiful baby girl? Ridiculous. You have the right idea. My girls play hockey and watch with their dad. My son has little interest in hockey. My younger daughter is obsessed with cars and they bond over that, while my husband has shown all three how to change tires and car maintenance. If my son wanted to be an artist or design clothes we would support him whatever he wants. Genitals do not define likes or interests. Unfortunately your wife will pass these ideas to your daughter which you need to combat.", "NTA, please teach your girl those things like yoi plan.

Exposure to said hobbies does.", "You're progressive enough to teach your daughter all those things. Good on you. Your in-laws can go suck eggs with their backward-ass misogyny.  Obviously, NTA.", "NTA. At all. The in-laws on the other hand... Not only are they narrow minded and out of touch regarding gender roles, your wife's pregnancy isn't about them. If they want a boy they can (or should have) adopt one. It's not your responsibility to validate their twisted views and feelings.", "NTA. You don\u2019t have to comply with their whatever tf that is tbh. A girl is not a sin nor a disappointment. Is as much of a blessing and I wished more families saw it this way too", "I am a 35 old woman. I love sports. And cars.

Their patriarchal desire for testicles and a penis is kind of\u2026antiquated.", "NTA\n\nIf your in-laws want a son, there are tons of young boys in the foster system. They can live their boyparent dreams *and* improve the life of someone in care.\n\nAlso, I'm a straight woman. I'm a ravenous NFL, NHL, and curling fan. If I have the proper set of tools I can fix just about anything wrong with a car. I shoot, ride horses, and can bake a kickass strawberry shortcake. Your kid is gonna like what she likes. The broader her exposure to different things, the more she's gonna have interests in.\n\nI definitely would not apologize to your in-laws nor would I comfort them, you don't need to be apologizing on behalf of your daughter for what's between her legs.

So many red flags in that family.", "And sadly it seems the wife internalized her parents' misogyny and seems to share many of the same gender expectations regarding the daughter that she is going to bring into the world.  I hope OP consciously strives to end this bullshit and has a kickass daughter.", "And, OP, make sure *your wife* doesn\u2019t continue the nonsense into the next generation of putting limits on your baby daughter, like her parents put on her. \n\nNTA And if a grand*daughter* is such a big disappointment that grandma would *cry* about it, (OMFG, holy overreaction, Batman)\u2026then maybe the grandparents just don\u2019t see their granddaughter very much.

Such a limiting sexist view.", "Nowadays they should be happy just for having a grandkid in the civilized world. Both my family, girlfriend's family, my brother in law wife family and sister's husband family will have nothing and either like it or shut up about it.", "WHAT!!!! Girls are NOT allowed to touch toy cars, their fingers will burn!!! /S (just in case)lol.", "I mean I even understand plumbing, even with all my estrogen.", "Yes but I have literally watched collegiate bowling on some ESPN channel.", "ESPN always run a \"the OCHO\" special in August with weird or less popular sports because of the Dodgeball gag.
