When I was 14 and she was 21 she got pregnant with my nephew. Her ex cheated while she was pregnant. After she had him they never bonded and she left him alone with me and my mom and went out to live her life instead. We raised him and I loved him like my own. I was basically his mom since I did online school so I was always home anyways. He didn't even sleep in her room nor did she ever buy him anything. My mom said it was long term post partum but I thought she just didnt like him. When he was almost three my sister told us shes moving to a different city and taking him. I knew something was wrong when she didnt even pack his toys or clothes and said she was buying him new ones even though she never even bought him diapers as a baby. We were shocked but what could we do? I cried for weeks. \n\nAfter she moved we kept in touch regularly but after a few months her calls became distant and in between and she stopped letting us FaceTime him. My mom and I kept freaking out since we hadn't seem him in weeks so we called the police to do a wellness check. The police called us to say her apartment was empty but there was no children's items in her apartment. We were sick and drove there immediately. Finally after we got there she finally answered pissed and we found out she gave up her son for adoption after only being with him for two months\u2026 he was legally adopted. She couldnt even face us and refused to see us. \n\nWe didn't believe her and hired a lawyer and it was confirmed to be true. She had placed him for adoption and he was adopted in a closed adoption. We would never see him again. We were devastated. She could have just left him with us. Why take him and adopt him to strangers because you couldn't \u201chandle\u201d being a mom? She said she was too ashamed to bring him back to us since we didnt consider her a good mom and that the couple loves him and wanted a baby so to mind our business and hes not our son. After that my mom and I cut her off.\n\n\nThat was three years ago. I still hold a grudge to this day against her. We haven't spoken to my nephew all this time, lord knows how he is. The agency she used doesn't even exist anymore and was bought out by a different company. She messaged me on Instagram a year ago and I blocked her but I always remembered her @ in the back of my mind. I searched her up boredly the other day and saw shes now engaged and pregnant \u2026 she posted a gender reveal and its a boy. All the trauma hit me again. I felt sick. Her fiance was tagged so I messaged him letting him know everything, sent him proof and all, and told him to sign the birth certificate so she cant give up her son again. He read my message and ever since hes deleted all pictures of her and unfollowed her. She called my grandma crying saying I ruined her life and my grandma relayed the message to me. I told my grandma to tell her she did the same to three people and shes going to do the same to her baby. He deserves to know who he was gonna marry.

Holy shit I\u2019m probably going to get downvoted to death but what she did was beyond cruel and disgusting. \n\nShe hated herself for being a terrible mother so she decided to give her son up to complete strangers rather than caring family FULLING WILLING TO PICK UP HER SLACK because apparently if she can\u2019t have him no one can! \n\nNormally I\u2019m sympathetic towards younger parents but with her it\u2019s just bad choices after bad choices after bad choices. She didn\u2019t give the boys life up because they couldn\u2019t afford it. She did it because she was ashamed and embarrassed. \n\nShe\u2019s a walking red flag who had what was coming to her and her fianc\u00e9e deserves to know what she did to abandon her son. \n\nI\u2019m so proud of what you did", "Probably going to be a semi unpopular opinion, but in my eyes? HARD NTA!\n\n\u2022Your sister left her son with you\n\n\u2022Took him away\n\n\u2022Dropped him off at an adoption center\n\n\u2022Never told her ex fianc\u00e9 that she had a previous child\n\nYou can run from your past all you want, and people say they can change, but in this case your sister is a monster.", "If I were your sisters future spouse, you betcha I would wanna know. NTA", "NTA. Your past mistakes can haunt you for a lifetime.\n\nI understand she's embarrassed and wants to pretend it never happened. She should start by acknowledging it and asking for forgiveness.\n\nShe screwed up your relationship with your nephew; that's a pretty big mistake. He (nephew) doesn't have a choice in all this, but its pretty fucked up trying to pretend he doesn't exist.", "NTA that poor baby, your sister is a monster. She could\u2019ve left him with you and your mom. Her fianc\u00e9 deserved to know the truth. If she\u2019s really pregnant, hopefully he will get full custody. What a heartbreaking story.", "NTA. She obviously hadn\u2019t told him or he would have blocked you. He deserved to know that she abandoned her first child.", "NTA.  Her fianc\u00e9 deserved to know the truth and obviously, she had not told him.  He very likely would have found out eventually.\n\nIf it had been longer than 3 years since this happened, maybe, but I'm not sure that's long enough to truly change that much.  What she did you and her own child was cruel and heartless.  She should have given the child a chance to grow up with family that loved him and people he already trusted and she took that all away.    \n\nAny idea if she got money for the adoption?  Is so, that was likely the plan all along, to take him away and give him up for adoption.\n\nPerhaps do the DNA tests online and hope he one day does the same and finds you.  But like a missing child, I'm sure you're never going to stop looking for him every where you go, in every child around the same age you see.", "NTA.  That is info that I would want to know if I were marrying someone, because it speaks greatly to her character.  And considering he is going to have a child with her yes, he needed to know this, for the future child's benefit and protection.", "NTA. Hopefully, he won't let his son disappear, too.", "Yup, she hardcore deserved this. NTA but you need to free yourself from this drama if you can. I\u2019d go no contact for real and don\u2019t randomly search for her anymore. She doesn\u2019t seem like she\u2019s going to become the person who takes responsibility for her actions so she\u2019ll continue to do messed up stuff and you\u2019re not going to be able to save everyone from her. Nor is that your job. \n\nLet this be your last F you to her and go live your life.", "NTA\n\nyou saved that man", "Nta\n\nHe had the right to know what he was getting into. What she did was her decision, but let's be honest, how many people could overlook it?\n\n\nShe didn't disclose she had a son. Lied to her family about where he was. This is pretty sick.\n\n\nIn addition, there are some things you can not run from.\n\n\nI believe op did the right thing.", "NTA.\n\nI am so sorry that happened, of course you are still upset after only three years. That isn't something you would ever get over, it will always be there. I wish you healing & reunification with that kiddo in the future. I know it's far fetched but stranger things have happened. He's very young but DNA sites reunite people all the time. Sending you positive vibes & kindness.\n\nI think you did the right thing warning her fiance. At least he knows what she's capable of and can try to ensure he's got a legal plan in place to care for his child.", "NTA, I don\u2019t care if anyone says differently. She deserved it.", "NTA \n\nWhat she did to you your mum and your nephew was awful. She ripped him away from a loving home and let him go to strangers. He must have been so confused and upset. Hopefully he\u2019s now settled and happy. \n\nI don\u2019t blame you for warning her fianc\u00e9e, who knows if she will decide she\u2019s not cut out to be a mother yet again with this one", "I'm usually against butting in and giving out personal info about someone's past, but this is a unique situation. She took her son out of a loving home, away from the only parents he'd ever known, all because she was afraid to face you, and now she's having another?? That poor baby's father absolutely needed to know. She's willing to traumatize a child just because she's embarrassed about failing as a parent. NTA, and I really hope the father gets full custody immediately.", "This is way too big for Reddit. Please seek therapy for everyone here.", "NTA.\n\nI see a lot of \"blame the messenger\" responses.  If she has really grown, if she was really in a healthy relationship, she would have told her boyfriend.  This would not have been news to him.", "NTA\n\nA human life deserves better than \"maybe this time\".", "NTA. Normally I feel old news should stay that way and you don\u2019t know if they\u2019ve changed. BUT, your sister sounds mentally ill this could totally happen again and the fianc\u00e9 should be warned.", "I\u2019m going to have to go YTA. Obviously your sister should\u2019ve spoken to you and your mom about her plans to put her son up for adoption to inform you. However she\u2019s not mandated to allow your mom custody of her son. Maybe she didn\u2019t agree with the parenting style or found the home to be toxic. The fact that she didn\u2019t feel comfortable to be honest with her family says a lot. She should have told her fianc\u00e9 about her past but everyone is entitled to their own secrets. I think it\u2019s good that the fianc\u00e9 will know to have his name on the birth certificate but I don\u2019t think the way you went about it was appropriate. At the end of the day my YTA is because you felt entitled to someone else\u2019s child. You\u2019re NTA for being traumatized. I think it would\u2019ve been better if you actually communicated with your sister first instead of blocking her and allowing her to explain herself, ask her if the fianc\u00e9 knows, told her to tell him and if she still didn\u2019t at that point then informing him.", "NTA. The existence of your own children is not a secret, and it's not up to your sister if you share that information. This is a heartbreaking story, it doesn't really matter who is an asshole.", "NTA.  This sucks no matter what.  I'm sure there are going to be a lot of YTA and ESH here, but after you went through with your nephew I can't blame you for not wanting to sit on this information and live with the results of withholding the information for the rest of your life if the worst case scenario happened.", "NTA - Do you know how hard it was not to cry when reading this? Your sister is a narcissistic monster and her fianc\u00e9 deserved to know.", "The fiance deserved to know what he was getting into with your sister. She should have told him herself before agreeing to marry him. Her hiding her past does not bode well for her future. NTA", "NTA - there are no words, her fiance deserves to know", ">we found out she gave up her son for adoption after only being with him for two months\u2026\n\nI just don't understand why she took him in the first place, he was taken care of by you and your mom and had a good life.\n\nWhat she did is beyond selfish and cruel, that poor baby boy, I just can't imagine how he felt being taken from the only mom he knew, you, not your sister, and then given for adoption.\n\nI hope you can reunite one day. \n\n>and its a boy. All the trauma hit me again. I felt sick. Her fiance was tagged so I messaged him letting him know everything, sent him proof and all\n\nThis the best thing you've done, you should be proud. \n\n>saying I ruined her life\n\nYou didn't ruin her life, she did it. You reap what you sow.", "While I don't think we should be giving out secrets like that, this is some long range revenge that I can get behind. Also, if I'm having a child with someone this is something I would like to know. The fiance could've probably moved past it if she didn't omit this from him", "So you are  20 ~~23~~ now OP?\n\nHonestly I can't blame you. I think you have some trauma surrounding this situation and your feelings aren't wrong because she planned from the beginning to give up that baby before she even moved. She ruined her own life honestly bc what was she going to do when the son is old enough to look for her. I hope in the future you get closure.", "NTA - Her fiance deserved to know", "First of all I'm sorry you went through this and I hope your nephew has a wonderful life even when it's sadly not with you. Personally I think NTA. There are things someone should know about their partner and this situation is one of them. You did the right thing in my opinion, because if your sister truly changed she would've told him about this situation.", "Normally you\u2019d be the asshole but that\u2019s low key karma \nNTA", "Oof.  I hope that poor baby has a good life.  Your sister is a piece of work.\n\nYou may want to check out r/HelpMeFind and they may be able to track down the adoption agency for you.  At least you can find out if your nephew is safe and happy.\n\nNTA.", "NTA", "NTA \n\nI felt sick just reading that story", "NTA. To all the people who say it wasn't OPs business, the sister made it so by making them assume the role of a parent to her child. What your sister did is unforgivable, and I'm sure the fiance was grateful that he found out the truth. I only hope that she won't take it out on her unborn child. My sympathies go to you, OP.", "A child can\u2019t protect themself-  the new father has the right to know what your sister is capable of when she is stressed. \n\nI don\u2019t believe she ever wanted to raise her child. What kind of mother doesn\u2019t take toys or clothes with her?  NTA", "NTA.\n\nAll I can imagine is my son, he's just turned 4 so not much older, being taken away from my wife and I and put in an unfamiliar home. I don't think it a stretch to say that it would affect him for life. He would never be the same.\n\nYour sister is a monster.", "First initial thoughts are N T A but then I think what consequences could this have on the baby? Will she abort the baby (if it\u2019s possible), will she give birth and do the same thing again, maybe she\u2019ll care for it this time around, or the dad will try and take care of it. There\u2019s a large variety of consequences the baby will have to deal with due to OPs actions. Whereas if nothing was said there\u2019s potential the dad would\u2019ve been fine and OPs sister may have raised the kid properly even if they had issues down the line. Honestly this a can of worms so just gonna stay neutral.", "NTA.  A person's past matters no matter what modern propaganda tries to tell us to the contrary.", "Nta! Her fiance has some sense as well", "NTA your sister might have gotten money from the adopting parents (some parents get desperate) and say him has a paycheck. Seems suspicious she took him super quickly. The one buying him new toys would be the new parents.", "NTA. This was a bit of vengeance and I'm good with it.", "NTA. The nephew story broke my heart. I hope he is well and happy wherever he is.", "NTA! People are saying you are but what she did was so cruel! She let you have him for 3 years and she gave him up because she was too embarrassed to bring him back!!! How are people missing that!! That baby is going to look for his family one day and If he learns the truth he will be so devastated! People are saying your sister changed, she couldn\u2019t have changed that much to hide something like that from her fianc\u00e9! I would never want to be with a person like that! She\u2019s ruined her own life!", "I really hope this story is fake. God I want this to be fake so bad. It\u2019s hard for me to believe that people can be this cruel. Jesus.", "YTA.  The whole back story is tragic, yes.  But to insert yourself into her life right now is wrong.  It\u2019s simply none of your business.", "NTA. Struggled as to whether you were the A H here. Let\u2019s be honest, you did this out of spite. Your intention was to hurt your sister and cause as much damage as possible. In that regard, I do believe you were wrong. \n\nHowever, her fianc\u00e9 had a right to know. It\u2019s concerning she never revealed any of this to him, that does not demonstrate any real change to her behavior. Given he\u2019s having a child with her, it\u2019s necessary insight, for both his and his unborn child\u2019s sake. \n\nSo by being vindictive, you did potentially save this man and his child. Ends justify the means.", "There seems to be a lot of trauma in your story. With you, your mom and also your sister. I also think, that there is more to the story of her moving out with her son so suddenly. So for me there is not enough info here to properly judge.", "Now she\u2019s pregnant with someone who will resent her. I understand you\u2019re punishing her and \u201couting\u201d her but what about her child now? What if he follows the same fate? That\u2019s what worries me", "I was originally going with NTA, but going with ESH.   \nI understand you're hurt by your sister's actions, and why you cut her off.  \nBut in your spite, you ruined what might have been a good relationship, and now your new nephew won't have a father in his life.", "This is a tough one, but I'm leaning towards NTA.  \n\n\nYour sister abandoned your nephew, rather than let him be raised by a loving aunt and grandmother. This was a deeply hurtful and traumatic experience for you. What she did is not something that's easy to forgive, and it's something that you will never forget.  \n\n\nAt the same time, people change. Maybe your sister has grown these last three years. Maybe having another child was her attempt to process her own grief and regrets over being a bad mother the first time around. I'm not saying you should forgive her, but maybe just ignore her. It's not truly no contact if you stalker her socials. Maybe she deserves a second chance at life. That being said, if her fianc\u00e9 broke up with her over this, I feel like there were other issues in their relationship. The fact that someone had a previous child that they gave up and never mentioned isn't a rational reason to break up with someone.  \n\n\nAs for your nephew, I would suggest signing up for one of those ancestry/genealogy websites if you haven't already. If your DNA is on file somewhere, someday your nephew could sign up and possibly DNA match with you.", "NTA - I was enraged reading this. I can only imagine the heartache left in your sisters wake. Redemption is possible if we do the work to be forgiven and we work on change and becoming a better person. Your sister just chose to walk down the path of denial and pitch a tent there.", "NTA. I feel so bad for the baby she's pregnant with. Hopefully the (ex) fianc\u00e9 takes your advice and signs the birth certificate. That kid is going to have it so much harder now. I hope she was able to learn from her mistakes and will be a better mom to her new baby.", "NTA. Your sister is cruel! You have every right to feel the way you do. She could have given the baby up to you and your mom.", "NTA. That is one less life she is going to ruin.", "NTA", "YTA. You could\u2019ve chosen to be the bigger person. And besides it\u2019s not like she killed her son or sold him into trafficking. She LEGALLY gave him up for adoption. And like it or not, that is her right as a parent. Hopefully he is loved in his current home.", ">she got pregnant with my nephew\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA, but this threw me for a loop... Am I the only one that read this as \"Had sex with my nephew and ended up pregnant\"?\n\nI was wildly confused XD", "NTA. my heart hurts reading this", "NTA", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOMG the cruelty\n\nHow could your sister do that to her son? poor kid.\n\n  \nI feel your pain. I think you did the right thing. this second baby must be safe", ">Why take him and adopt him to strangers because you couldn't \u201chandle\u201d being a mom?\n\nFor money?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA, OP. You saved your sister's fianc\u00e9e from wasting his life on a piece of trash you sister is.", "NTA - others have summed it up pretty well. Just a thought if it's something you wanted. It might be worth doing an ancestry test or something similar, so if he ever does the same thing, you might be able to find each other", "I can\u2019t even type out what I want to say bc I\u2019ll get banned. NTA you saved this guy\u2019s life and hopefully gave him a chance to father his child.", "NTA you\u2019re a hero you should be applauded.", "NTA - Your sister was a selfish 21 year old and didn't accept responsibility for her own child.  Perhaps she's changed, people do grow up. Or perhaps she is still a monster. I think her fianc\u00e9 has a right to know. Then he can tell for himself, whether she is still the monster that she was.", "NTA: but I hope you and your mom put your dna in to a database see if your nephew ever finds you. Some hope. You told the truth to her fianc\u00e9, did the best thing for him and his future.", "NTA. this is one of the most heartbreaking things i\u2019ve ever read in this forum, or maybe on this app. my heart is with you, and your sister is a waste of human life.", "NTA all the words I could use that even begins to adequately describe that\u2026person you, for some unfathomably reason, calls your sister would most definitely get me banned. \n\nYou probably just saved both the man and child from a lifetime of misery and suffering.", "NTA\n\nI understand that *technically* it was an ah move but that was so justified are you Timothy Olyphant? In no way can I perceive your actions as wrong because\u2026she just wow. Props on looking out for baby #2 and helping homie dodge that nuke.", "NTA. I had a similar experience growing up and I'm sorry you're going through this. It may have been harsh to reveal that information but she should have been honest with her fiance. I hope somehow you're able to see your nephew again some day.", "NTA - this is information he is entitled to know. She\u2019s having his kid, so he needs that history. You are right to have told him.", "That\u2019s so sad and I\u2019m sorry you went through such an awful thing. NTA. You saved this guy lots of heartache.", "ESH. This is a very broken family\u2026I could never, ever, interfere with someone\u2019s second chance, or do-over in life. She was cheated on. Had a baby too soon. Suffered Postpartum Depression (which should not be taken lightly). She lost her mom, and her little sister.\n\n(Why, instead of feeling support, did she feel so shameful? And embarrassed? How did you and your mom treat her *before* to get her to decide she\u2019d rather leave her child with STRANGERS, than her own family?) \n\nShe lost her son. Then it took her 3 yrs to establish a new home, and new future family members-her fianc\u00e9, and her unborn child. Then you destroyed that. I\u2019m not sure what the \u201clesson\u201d here is. She just learned you HATE her guts to the core, and anytime she tries to build a family, you\u2019re just going to destroy it with her past, so why even try? But good for you, I guess?", "^(NTA, he deserved to know and she needs to be sterilized. She doesn't deserve a 2md chance to get rid of another child. You did the right thing.)", "NTA. You did the fianc\u00e9 a favour.\n\nThat\u2019s a big secret to keep from a partner you\u2019re building a life with. If she have told him before, then you revealing the truth wouldn\u2019t have affected her since he would have already known and accepted it. It\u2019s all on her.", "Holy fuck, absolutely NTA\n\nHe deserves to know what kind of a mother she is before getting any further into that relationship. I'm so sorry about what happened with your nephew.", "Ok, my opinion is going to be an unpopular one and I already know I'm gonna have people down voting me on this but..\n\nYou were not \"basically his mom\" you were 14. The way you phrased \"left him alone with me and went out to live her life instead\" sounded as if you were implying she literally left, but she obviously still lived at home. \n\nNo matter how you feel about her choices, they were *her* choices to make. And no matter how you feel about your relationship to your nephew, he was not your son. Again, you were 14. She, as the mother, had every right to give up custody of her kid. Even if you (and I) think it wasn't the right choice.\n\nAnd I do actually think it was not your place to tell her partner about her life. There are just some stories that are not yours to tell. Your sister's being one of them. Mainly because your sister's perspective isn't even being asked for. You're quick to tell *her* story to people because you're resentful of her choices. All of those choices being hers to make.\n\nSo I'm going against the popular vote and saying YTA.", "NTA. Sorry you had to go through that. Honestly best plan would be to just cut the chord with her. That kind of toxic behaviour is unforgivable for me.", "Ouch\u2026this hurt my heart! She needs to not have children! NTA", "Holy Batman! You are so NTA, OP. Your sister, on the other hand, makes me sick! What a horrible excuse for a human!", "NTA, she hurt you and broke your heart. Her fianc\u00e9e needed to know the truth. I hope he sues for full custody.", "Nta!!", "NTA.  I think your sister sold your nephew to the adoptive couple, and they covered it up.  Never forgive this, do it again if you get a chance.  Haunt her, she is evil.", "NTA. She can just throw away a whole child and think she can keep it a secret. You did the right thing.", "NTA", "NTA. Hope you will meet your niece in the future.", "NTA.  If you can, put yourself on things like 23 and me and Ancestry.  When your nephew is old enough, he might choose to use DNA testing to try to find the people who he would most likely remember from when he was little.

She deserves the karma and does not deserve a do-over.", "Good for you\nNTA", "NTA. If she truly loved her fiance, she would have been honest with him from the start. You don't go into a marriage hiding something like that.\n\nI'm so sorry you had to go through this. I'm not sure why she thought a random family was better than her own, but you did the right thing.", "NTA- the fianc\u00e9 deserved to know what he was getting himself into. That\u2019s a huge part of her life and while I normally don\u2019t condone bringing up one\u2019s past, this is definitely warranted. \n\nAlso, I am sorry that you lost your nephew. That is so heartbreaking reading about what your sister did and I am sorry that you have to live with the unknown.", "NTA so much to unbag here, why didn't she just bring him back and let you legally adopt him?

NTA\n\nI\u2019m sad for the new baby, if she has it; and not sure whether the ex fianc\u00e9 would\u2019ve lasted, even had you not e-mailed him. \n\nThe dumpster fire will probably continue, just burning, just in a different alley.", "I'm leaning towards YTA. This child is going to be born into a broken home because of this and have their lives made that much harder and to what benefit I'm not really sure. Your sister needs to make amends for what she did but to have this child's entire life caught in the crossfire of a revenge stunt is just horrible.", "This is the clearest case of ESH I have seen on here. You guys all seem like shitty, shitty people. The kid honestly might be better off without you all. I get that you all love him in your own way, and did what you thought was right, but none of you are putting his needs before your own, and that is not a healthy kind of love for any child to experience. You clearly shamed tf out of your sister. Y'all need to grow up. Let your sister do so and let yourself do so. Stop ruining each other's lives out of bitterness and old hurt.", "ESH, her for the past, you for your current actions. You do know that you\u2019ve likely condemned another child to the adoption system/broken family? Are you going to do this every time she gets into a new relationship? \n\nWhat she did years ago was awful but ultimately it was her decision to place him up for adoption, not yours or your mums. You don\u2019t know the full reasons why, only she knows that. PPD is real and by her comment about you thinking bad of her it seems like she felt a lot of judgment from you and her mother. She was not capable of raising him and felt like adoption was the best life for him at that time. You were valid for feeling angry and grieving the loss of your nephew but I don\u2019t think condemning another child to the same fate by destroying your sisters life was the right answer. \nNow she had a fianc\u00e9, a stable home and was starting a new life. Should she have told him beforehand? Probably, though the stigma regarding MH issues and adoption are evidently a serious issue and why she probably thought no one would understand. That life built has now been permanently damaged, the unborn child will grow up either in a broken home or passed over to the adoption system and you\u2019ve started the pain all over again. All for revenge. Are you satisfied now or are you going to continue to do this every time you find out she\u2019s trying to move on?", "NTA. You\u2019re a good one OP.

Adoption is a business now!", "Wow YTA. You did something purely out of spite and your motivation to get revenge. \nEven if your view of what your sister did is correct, there is still nothing redeeming about what you chose to do now. You\u2019d be more sympathetic if you dropped the fake \u201che deserved to know stuff\u201d and admit why you did what you did - malice.", "NTA\n\nYour sister is a MONSTER.

She's doesn't deserve happiness until she finds her son", "NTA\n\nI believe her future spouse had a right to know what kind of woman he would\u2019ve been marrying. He had a right to know that she had another child (which could very well pop up later in life and catch everyone off guard!).. he had a right to know that she easily and sneakily gives up her children (esp bc she\u2019s pregnant with HIS child). and, quite frankly, he needed to know that she is the type of person to simply run away with little to no explanation.", "Nta but please remember you were not the mother. Legally you would never have been granted custody because you were still under age.", "NTA, the trauma that little boy went through.  First, he bonded with grandma and aunt.  This his mother that there was no bond with took him away for two months.  He is starting to adjust to this then he is moved to a stranger's home.  Now she is having another child.  The father of this child knows nothing about her past.  This was not a teenager giving a newborn up for adoption.  This was an adult giving away a toddler.  He has the right to know this and make sure his child is protected and not moved around from home to home.", "NTA you did the right thing . I would have done the exact same thing. Sometimes the hardest thing to do is what's right. I pray that whoever you are that you and your mom find your nephew one day. Don't feel bad you didn't do anything wrong.", "NTA your sister is a monster. If I were the fiance, I'd wait for the baby to pop and petition for full custody on the basis of her child abandonment the first time around.

I could understand wanting a closed adoption at birth if she thought it would be too traumatizing to be around the kid and family, let me say that.\n\nHowever, that is not what she did. She took a toddler who was already attached to his family, lied to you all about where she and him were going, and adopted him out under honestly rather sketchy circumstances. That kid is going to have a lifetime of attachment issues from this, and it was absolutely not the best move, especially if people he knew and had an attachment to were willing to raise him.\n\nWhat she did was cold and messed up. Yeah, fiance should know if she's been lying to him and honestly should  be moving to get legal custody or visitation for his own kid so she can't do it again now that it's over", "NTA- I hope her ex gets full custody.

Usually I say mind your business but this is too much.", "NTA, not even close. There are youthful mistakes, there are too-young parents who opt for adoption out of responsibility, and then there's child abandonment (trafficking?) because you couldn't be arsed. Her ex absolutely deserved to have that information because it speaks to her fundamental character, and given his reaction, he likely didn't know she even had a child before this one she's currently pregnant with. And given her reaction, to blame you, she still feels no guilt for what she did.\n\nOn that topic, what is going to happen with this new baby? Is the father intending to sue for custody? You may be able to help him achieve that with the evidence you have. Given your sister's past and present behaviour, she isn't to be trusted with another baby.", "NTA.  You have enabled her (hopefully former) fiance to be prepared to protect his child.  I'm sorry you and your mom lost your nephew.

Because the past is the past, sometimes ... BUT ...\n\nShe is carrying the man's son.  And they're getting married.  His reaction tells us she didn't tell him.  And I cannot think of any more important topic of honesty than who you have been, who you are, and who you want to be with children.  This is a critical issue when making the commitment of marriage. \n\nAnd not being honest with him BEFORE becoming pregnant with HIS child ... was the ultimate in deception.  He is not walking into parenthood, with her, on an honest playing field.  \n\nI understand that first time parents, and those who don't have a history with kids ... it's a crap shoot about who they are until you're there.  But her past directly speaks to it.  And she didn't give him honesty in having a child with him.  Her past is all about having a kid.  Hiding that from him was wrong.  \n\nNTA", "NTA. poor child. Poor fiance and child to be. Funny how she was willing to welcome the 2nd child into her life but not the other one. It's like if her baby's father does her bad, she will get rid of the baby too.\n\nIt was so wrong of her to take away your nephew and then just give him away. it feels like she sold off her own child and it's not just a normal adoption. Hope that child is living well. \n\nYou did right for informing her current partner. It's just about fair. He deserves to know what he is getting himself into", "YTA. Her first child is in a stable home with family. Legally adopted. Wasn\u2019t left at fire station. You were a kink and could not qualify to be any sort of parent to the child. You want vengeance so you try to ruin her life? Congrats. But Your behavior just solidifies that you continue to lack the ability to parent any child. Especially hers. Grow up you child.", "YTA. You sister made the choice to give her son up for adoption because she was not ready to be a single mother at the age of 21. That is very different than having a child years later, while in a stable relationship. There are lots of people who chose to give up their children as teens/young adults, that does not disqualify them from being good parents later in life. \n\nI am sorry that her actions hurt you, and I can see why it would seem to cruel to do a closed adoption rather than give the child to you and your mother, but there are good reasons why someone would prefer a closed adoption to a familial one. \n\nShould you sister have told her fianc\u00e9 about her past, yes. But you made the decision to tell him out of anger and spite.", "YTA. Idk I think her past would of came up sooner or later with the new fianc\u00e9. I think since you were no contact with your sister you had no right to butt in her life despite everything she did to you and your family. I think you acted out in vengefulness and everyone is agreeing with you bc it was such a horrid thing she did. But it doesn\u2019t justify continuing to hurt one another when there is now another child involved. \n\nHer past was going to be revealed whether you told him or she told him later or he found out some other way. But it was not your story to tell. You made your choice when you went no contact to leave this horrid person out of your life. Let them be horrible by themselves. Even tho you feel justified bc you didn\u2019t deserve her other son being taken, a given away. It doesn\u2019t make it ok for you to do this as well. It\u2019s all already so bad. At some point you need to stop the madness and let her be. She has made her life what she wanted which is filled with regret and guilt and loneliness and shame. Now you will live with the same. You may feel good right now that you ratted her out but do you truly think this will make your nephew come back? Or make everything that happened justified? It won\u2019t. Because the hurt has already happened and you ALL need to move on and heal and hope one day your Nephew finds you again so that you can rebuild a relationship where you are not hurting and he is not the victim. \n\nNow there\u2019s another baby in a similar situation.", "ESH, So now she has another fatherless child she can be a bad mother to.

What you did was more about vengeance than any real concern for the man she was with who is a total stranger to you. You just wanted to make sure you watched her experience consequences in which you had a direct hand to make up for the control you felt you lacked when she took your nephew away.

I cut off my sister a longgg time ago. When I was 14 and she was 21 she got pregnant with my nephew. After she had him they never bonded and she left him alone with me and my mom and went out to live her life instead. We raised him and I loved him like my own. I was basically his mom since I did online school so I was always home anyways. He didn't even sleep in her room nor did she ever buy him anything. My mom said it was long term post partum but I thought she just didnt like him. When he was almost three my sister told us shes moving to a different city and taking him. I knew something was wrong when she didnt even pack his toys or clothes and said she was buying him new ones even though she never even bought him diapers as a baby. We were shocked but what could we do? I cried for weeks. \n\nAfter she moved we kept in touch regularly but after a few months her calls became distant and in between and she stopped letting us FaceTime him. My mom and I kept freaking out since we hadn't seem him in weeks so we called the police to do a wellness check. The police called us to say her apartment was empty but there was no children's items in her apartment. We were sick and drove there immediately. Finally after we got there she finally answered pissed and we found out she gave up her son for adoption after only being with him for two months\u2026 he was legally adopted. She couldnt even face us and refused to see us. \n\nWe didn't believe her and hired a lawyer and it was confirmed to be true. She had placed him for adoption and he was adopted in a closed adoption. We would never see him again. We were devastated. She could have just left him with us. Why take him and adopt him to strangers because you couldn't \u201chandle\u201d being a mom? She said she was too ashamed to bring him back to us since we didnt consider her a good mom and that the couple loves him and wanted a baby so to mind our business and hes not our son. After that my mom and I cut her off.\n\n\nThat was three years ago. I still hold a grudge to this day against her. We haven't spoken to my nephew all this time, lord knows how he is. The agency she used doesn't even exist anymore and was bought out by a different company. She messaged me on Instagram a year ago and I blocked her but I always remembered her @ in the back of my mind.

But legally is what mattered in the decision that was made. It sucks balls, but it\u2019s what happened in the past.", "OP's mother wasn't caring for this child. OP was. Again, why would the sister be obligated to allow her mother to adopt her child under the assumption a minor would actually care for him?", "Yeah and I\u2019m sure that heartless texts from op were the best way to convey that information. Definitely didn\u2019t impact the way he reacted at all. /s \n\nYou have no idea that her intention wasn\u2019t to tell him *when she was ready*", "That is an impressive stretch, you should teach yoga.", "Russian roulette? Do you know how many hoops people who apply to be adoptive parents through agencies/states have to go through? Background checks, interviews, home visits.", "I hope you\u2019re not treated based solely on your worst actions.", "Her chance to be better was the opportunity to disclose her past to a man she was trying to start a family with.  She clearly didn't as evidenced by his reaction to getting told.  So she had one and blew it.", "Legality has nothing to do with morality and morally what she did was horrible. Thank god the fiance knows what she is capable of now", "That\u2019s crazy! Doesn\u2019t change shit\n\nIt\u2019s an established fact that OP and mom LOVE their \u201cson\u201d  \n\nIt\u2019s left to chance what happens to the kiddo behind closed doors in their adopted home.\n\nStill even a 1% risk is too great for any sensible mother.", "OP made it impossible to know whether she was gonna tell her fianc\u00e9 or not.", "It seems we aren\u2019t communicating effectively with one another at this point. I agree with you, what the sister did in the past was awful. However I don\u2019t agree that OP had a right to tell the fianc\u00e9. You can disagree which is completely fine and the whole point of this forum. However I will be disengaging from this conversation since we\u2019re going in circles. Thank you for you insight on the situation", "You don\u2019t let your children do things with a 1% risk!?!? \n\nHow is that even possible?", "Well she had plenty of time to do it and didn't.  Remember: she'd been with that guy long enough for things to progress to engagement and pregnancy.  It wasn't like they'd been together for a few weeks or anything."]}
