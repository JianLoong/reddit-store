If she lost it outside, it's gone. If she lost it in her room it will turn up in ten years when you move. There's also a good chance she doesn't know where she lost it. Don't die on this hill. Get her a new key and a better way of keeping it safe to help her not lose it. Or just switch one door to a keypad and then neither of you have to worry about it. YTA if you keep punishing her for a common teen (and adult!) mistake that's easily fixable.\n\nETA: Have you TOLD her all you want is honesty and for her to communicate? Because you punishing her over having lost it in her room is sending the message that you would be SO MUCH MORE ANGRY if she lost it outside. You're shooting yourself in the foot here, my man.", "YTA. Stopping her from going out because she accidentally lost a key and is too afraid to tell you is completely counterintuitive. She's going to go out, resent you, and not tell you when something big happens that she might really need or want your help with.", "YTA. If you want communication - communicate. It's your responsibility as an adult and parent.", "There are so many battles when it comes to kids and teenagers, is a key that takes 20 minutes to replace truly worth it? Instead of hiding agendas and placing you two at odds, it may be easier to sit down and explain your frustration in an open manner. No one can read another\u2019s mind.", "Here's a better solution instead of the terrible suggestions of just letting her get away with it and doing nothing.\n\nMake her pay for whatever it costs to get a new lock and key, and then she's free to go.\n\nThat's a very fitting punishment and teaches responsibility of not losing your keys but also doesn't leave her searching for a long lost item all weekend.", "Teenagers lose stuff all the time. I can understand that it's a little unnerving when it's a house key, and I'm not going to comment on your parenting/discipline style - having said that, you said that you want her to feel comfortable communicating with you, and it sounds like you aren't leading by example. Tell her that you want her to be honest about where she believes she lost the key. Maybe have her pay for the replacement key out of her allowance (or job, depending). But trying to call her bluff because you have a secret agenda - not a good look. YTA", "Parents overreacting to small stuff taught me to hide big stuff.\n\nYTA", "YTA \u2026. My husband and I have each lost our house keys more than once over the years.  It happens, get a backup key made and have her pay for it.  Then when she finds the original, she turns in the spare key and all is good.  \n\nBTW we found one of our \u201clost\u201d keys under our washing machine when we replaced it - 5 years after we lost it.  My husband found his \u201clost\u201d key in an old work bag when he was cleaning out a box during our last move.  \n\nSeriously this is ridiculous behavior on your part.", "It depends if that missing key can be linked back to your house. I\u2019d be going at it from that angle rather than just her lying to you.", "Okay soooo I think there\u2019s a better way to teach her that lesson without making her scared to tell you when she messes up. Get her a new key, but make her do some extra work to earn the money to get it. It\u2019s like 5 bucks for a key with a pretty design on it. Put it on a lanyard and a hook on her wall to hang it when she takes it off. Creates a good habit AAAAND shows her money doesn\u2019t grow on trees so she\u2019ll learn some responsibility!", "YTA. Saying she can't go anywhere until she finds her key seems like a disproportionate punishment. If you basically ground her for losing something small that can be easily replaced, it might make her afraid of how you would react if she lost something big or got into some kind of real trouble. She might not come to you with something that she really needs your help with. \n\nHere is my suggestion: ask her if she wants you to help her look for her key. Ask her where she really thinks she lost it. Tell her you aren't angry with her, and that if she thinks it's permanently lost and not just misplaced, that's OK too and you can go together to get a replacement. Also, ask her if she wants to brainstorm about how to make sure she can keep track of her keys in the future. Ask if it would help if you put a hook (like one of those command hooks) by your front door so she can hang her keys up every time she comes into the house. Ask if it would help if you got her a big or bright colored keychain so it's easy to spot in the future. (I'd suggest doing both, honestly. I always used to lose my keys, even as an adult, a key hook and a bright keychain really helped me!)\n\nAnd good luck!", "YTA. Have you tried, I dunno, talking to her?\n\n\u201cIs there any chance you lost it outside somewhere? If it\u2019s possible and since it hasn\u2019t turned up yet, we\u2019ll have to get the locks rekeyed so no one can get in if they have the key. In the meantime, let\u2019s go to the hardware store and you get a new key to use this weekend.\u201d Then have her be part of the process. If she\u2019s old enough, talk to her about contributing to the cost of this. \u201cSince you lost the key, how much of the bill do you feel is fair for you to pay?\u201d Knowing how much she can afford, accept a reasonable answer. \n\nYou\u2019ll be teaching her how to responsibly and easily remedy a common situation, and that honesty isn\u2019t something to be feared or manipulated. \n\nA lot of kids lie simply because they don\u2019t know what the outcome of a situation will be. They don\u2019t know if they\u2019re gonna get in trouble, if someone will be mad, if they\u2019re really fucked up or if something will cost a ton of money. \n\nThis would be more proactive, it\u2019s not a punishment, it just shows her \u201chey nbd, you can fix something even if you fuck it up.\u201d", "...keys are only 3-4 bucks 5 at most...

I\u2019m not congratulating her for it but what can you do? These things happen and will keep happening. Grounding her is pointless and will only teach her not to tell you things in fear of punishment that doesn\u2019t fit the crime.", "I suggest making her do whatever is required to get a new one made and asking her to pay for it is more in line with the offence. As others have said, I don't think this is a good hill to die on.", "YTA- because you aren't being honest either. You tell us that you're punishing her because she's not telling the truth where she lost it and you're telling her it's because she lost it. So, what are you even punishing her for?  Do you think it's clear to her? So, I think you're trying to instill some values, which is a commendable notion.. but basically... you're fucking it up. \n\nAt this point say sorry, I didn't handle this well, go get a key and some ice cream. \n\nI tell my kids all the time and it's amazing how often there are real life examples that come up and all I have to do now is say- \"Oh, lookee there kids.. what's the moral to that story?\"  And they'll say it for me... \"The coverup is almost always worse than the crime.\"  Remind them that you're there to help and guide them. To come to you with things. Then... don't get mad when they do. Work the problem, not punitively.  Now... you catch dishonesty after that.. hold them accountable. I think my kids would tell you that mostly what they got in trouble for was dishonesty, even if much of that was covering up for something else. Now, they tell me things I really don't want to know. But I know we have that trust.\n\nDo better.", "YTA. You admit that you haven't been the best father. And your solution to that is, what, punish your daughter for a mistake that many people have made? You're happy to ruin her weekend over such a small thing. You ARE being an asshole. And the fact that you are an asshole is why your relationship with your daughter has been so bad. Clearly you haven't changed as much as you think you have. She isn't lying to you; she really does think she lost it in her room. But you're determined to make her be the bad guy. You're insisting that she's lying and so you're happy to punish her until she agrees with your false accusation. This isn't a teaching moment because you're a bad teacher. All she'll learn from this is that you're a controlling asshole who falsely accused her and punished her for not wanting to admit to a lie.", "If you\u2019re certain she lost it outside the house, then the chances are very slim that she will find it. Just replace the key or rekey the house and make her cover at least a portion of the expense", "YTA. You assume she's lying. You must be perfect and have never lost anything.", "Losing a key isn\u2019t a misbehavior that needs to be corrected, it\u2019s just a mistake, rather than teach her not to lose keys, teach her to not be ashamed over simple mistakes. Gentle YTA you sound like you want to do what\u2019s right, it\u2019s just an accident", "Yta.  My son lost his keys after coming home a couple months ago.  We have both turned his room and the laundry room upside down.  Kids do stuff like this. He lost his spare set on prom night and we had to get a locksmith.  (Son paid).  All of my sons friends routinely have to crawl through a window cuz they don\u2019t know where their keys are.  This is the equivalent of a toddler spilling milk.  It\u2019s aggravating, but that\u2019s parenting.", "Yta. It. Is. A. Key.", "YTA- seems like an over reaction over a lost key. Plenty of responsible grown adults lose things all the time, it happens. No biggie, you just replace it.", "YTA, your heart is in the right place but you're going about it all wrong. Communicate with your daughter -- *tell* her you're looking for honesty. Model the type of communication you're trying to teach her. This is not a punishable offense, it's a teachable moment.  All of us adults have lost a key in our life -- fuck, dude, my hubs lost his entire keyring between the car and the house once.  Flat out disappeared into the aether, never to be seen again.  \n\nA big key of good parenting is to establish natural consequences. A natural consequence of losing your key is not to get punished.  It's having to go through the hassle of getting a new key cut or calling a locksmith when you're locked out.  So let her experience those consequences.  Go to Lowe's with her and get a new key cut.  If she doesn't have a key, don't let her go out later than you go to bed because you're not gonna get up to let her in.  Those sorts of things.", "YTA. You basically are gonnamakeher lose friends over a fucking key. You do understand keys are like... 2$?", "YTA. We have all done it. Use your words to communicate since that\u2019s what you want from her. Stop playing games.", "YTA. Instead of trying to help your teen find the key, you punish her by basically grounding her. It feels a bit unjustly when you've could've just talked to her about and come up with a solution of either trying to look for it or going to get the new key.", "YTA\n\nI mean if she looked and looked then she did what she can do. \n\nShe may not KNOW where and when she lost it. That's pretty normal to not know exactly when and where you lost something. \n\nAll kinds of responsible adults lose things like keys ON OCCASION. \n\nIf it becomes a habit, you find a solution (gps tag). \n\nBut punishing her for a simple mistake bc you ASSUME she's lying is a BAD move. It equates you liking or not liking the answer with punishment and not teaching her to COME to you if she made one and realizing that mistakes are normal. If there are real consequences, yes, she is responsible / accountable -- but this isn't that and isn't teaching that at all.", "YWBTA for the approach you described. \n\nInstead just tell her she is responsible for getting a new key. Have her check online for how to get a copy. Assuming this is just a typical house key (not from like an apartment complex where its not allowed to make copies), this is dead simple and absolutely something a teenager can figure out. Have her find out where to go to do it and how much it will cost (and she can pay for it). You might consider driving her where she needs to go to do it.\n\nDon't make it some weird battle of wills though where you're trying to get her to admit she lost it outside of her room. You want to teach her healthy communication, BUT YOU AREN'T MODELING HEALTHY COMMUNICATION.", "Just remember, it's possible one of your house keys is someone else's hands. You should seriously consider changing the locks.", "YTA. My parents tortured me in a different way over a key I lost when I was 12. It's just a fucking key, it's like 4$ to replace. Mistakes happen.", "if u want to treat her well and mend ur relationship, this is too much. \n\nYTA", "Yta.  If you don't want to be an AH about it then why are you being an AH?", "This seems like you're dying on this hill for no big deal. If it can be easily replaced then say just that and have a conversation about making sure she keeps better track of her belongings, especially her house key in the event that she needs to get in the house and you're not home. \n\nYou're making this the wrong teaching moment. Tell her she can't go anywhere until you *replace* the key and then take her to wherever to have a key cut and make her pay for it.\n\nYTA.", "NTA. I don\u2019t know what the fuck is wrong with everyone here but losing a key is a big deal. If she did lose it outside anyone could have it right now. Anyone could use it to get into your home. Make her find the key or admit she lost it elsewhere. If she did lose it out somewhere you need to get the house rekeyed.", "Not letting her go out because she lost a key is... a huge punishment. Would you give yourself house arrest if you lost a key? No? Then how on earth would it be a teaching moment? Get a new key and let her pay for it (or half of it, depending on the cost). That would make it an actual consequence (because paying for a new key would actually happen in real life) instead of a punishment that has nothing to do with what she did.\n\nAnd as someone else said... punishing her this way would NOT lead to her telling the truth. Because if this is a lighter version of the truth and you give her house arrest or a leisure time restriction as punishment for a perceived lighter misdeed... what would she think would happen to her for a perceived more severe misdeed? She would feel like you'd \"kill\" her (aka verbal, emotional and/or physical abuse. That is a valid fear, even if you now might think \"I would never do that and she should know\". Nope. It's still a valid fear)\n\nEdit: forgot verdict. YTA", "Give her a chore that you can correlate (I.e. Cleaning out the entryway so that there is a neat place for everyone to store their keys) and call it a win...the upcoming weekend is too pretty to wage a war with your kids if you can avoid it. \nNAH", "I\u2019d suggest a different approach as for me it\u2019s a safety issue. \n\nThe consequence of losing a house key is that the locks that work with that key need to be rekeyed. So let\u2019s try to avoid that. \n\nI\u2019d offer to help her look for her key (without judging the state of cleanliness or lack there of). Put on some music, look for the key, chat with your kid. \n\nIf you still can\u2019t find it after an hour or two, it\u2019s probably not going to be found in a reasonable timeframe, so rekeying is needed. \n\nSince she lost the key, she gets to handle the mental load of dealing with rekeying. This isn\u2019t punishment or \u2018teaching her a lesson\u2019 type of punishment. This is literally showing her life skills needed to know what to do when the unexpected happens. How to rectify the situation. Mistakes happen. So step up and work together to fix it. \n\nShe can do some online research as to reliability of a few locksmiths in the area. Then she can call around to a few locksmiths based off of her research and check on their availability, document the availability and cost. She may need some help with this. I\u2019d be fine sitting in the room or being generally around if she needs help. \n\nThen she can give you her list of two or three recommendations and you can call one to make the appointment. You need to do this part as the homeowner. \n\nShe can assist with some chores to put a bit more toward the household for a few weeks since you\u2019re having to incur the expense.\n\nUnless she\u2019s shown a blatant pattern of irresponsible behavior and disregard for the household I wouldn\u2019t even raise the idea of her paying for it (assuming you can absorb the cost). \n\nI think helping her to navigate the consequences of her mistake can help her in the long run to be more responsible, and can actually bring you closer rather than pulling you apart. \n\nIt\u2019s really easy to yell when we get mad or say harsh words, so if that already happened I\u2019d apologize for my behavior and would say it was the frustration but I\u2019ll try not to react that way again. I\u2019ve calmed down and thought about it and I think we should approach the situation differently. \n\nShe may need some time to process if there was a big argument. \n\nI\u2019d suggest doing the searching today because locksmiths may not be available on a holiday weekend, plus time is of the essence for safety.\n\nGentle YWBTA because I think what you\u2019re suggesting is a punishment rather than an opportunity to rectify the situation and help her to be honest and open with you. If your goal is a strong relationship, to help her navigate life, and to make sure the house is secure, grounding her is totally counterproductive.", "YTA but it is worth it. My mother was an AH until I learnt to be honest with her but she was also clear on communicating all she wanted was honesty. Now if your teen tells the truth, don't punish her regardless of where she has been. For me telling the truth made me immune from being grounded for whatever stupid thing I've done. By the end of my high-school years, I'd go to my mom for support when i had a problem. As an adult, I have a wonderful relationship with her and feel like I can tell her anything. I appreciate now all of the embarrassing moments and sacrifices she has made. I hated her temporarily to love her forever. It hurts (idk how many times she has gone to bed crying because I was an AH too) but it will get better. \n\nIn fact, I tell her she was too lenient on me because house chores were never big on her agenda and now I struggle as a young adult just keeping my place mess-free.", "INFO: Is this the hill you want to die on?", "You don\u2019t plan on replacing locks though?\nWhat if it was stolen by someone with the purpose to enter your house?\nOr it was lost near your home so a burglar might figure it belongs to your house? \ud83e\udd14", "NTA.

If it were my kid, and she hadn\u2019t found it by the end of the weekend, I would take her the next day to have a new one made, but I would make her pay for it with her allowance or saved birthday money or whatever. This is an important lesson for her to learn - she can\u2019t expect other people to bail her out as an adult, and you\u2019d be setting her up for failure down the road if she doesn\u2019t learn responsibility. \n\nTo be clear, I don\u2019t think this makes her a bad kid or anything of that nature.

She's going to attempt to hide any future losses from you, because in her eyes, losing things in the offense here.\n\nPerversely, your drive for honesty leads instead to an increase in dishonesty, because she misunderstands why she's being punished.\n\nIf I may offer up a suggestion for OP... don't think of this situation as \"you vs. your daughter.\" Instead, think of this as \"both of you vs. the problem.\" The problem here is that your daughter lost a key. The solution could be simple (make a new copy) or complex (get your house re-keyed because you live in a neighborhood where you think that is a safety concern).\n\nBreak down the problem. Figure out what your ACTUAL objectives are (presumably, you want honesty from your daughter and a new house key), and explain that.\n\nIf you tell her this in so many words, explain \"I grounded you because I wanted honesty, not the key back, but now I realize that I didn't make that clear,\" and figure out a solution while both of you are on the same page, you will strengthen your bond rather than harm it.", "This.

It was still incredibly sentimental and I did cry, but I care more about my partners feelings than a ring. That can be replaced, the love of my life cannot.

That's the exact opposite of what we should be doing on the planet Earth in 2023. Everything isn't replaceable, the world isn't full of endless resources. If you reread my comment (and my other comments on this post), you'll see that I agree it won't take 2 days to find the key. She'll look for a few hours, say she can't find it, they'll cut a new key and the situation will be resolved. \n\nIf you want to preach wastefulness and that there is no value to anything, that's your call.

My ring has value not because of the money, but because it\u2019s my damn engagement ring. Two days is a long time to look, and where did I say that everything has no value. It seems you\u2019re more materialistic than I am, as I keep everything for as long as I can use it, I just don\u2019t sweat if I lose something because sometimes shit happens. Of course I was sad, but would I rather berate and punish my partner or move tf on? \n\nif you want to make people feel like shit for something they can\u2019t locate and punish them for a mistake, that\u2019s absolutely on you. I care about the environment, but I absolutely care about my family and friends feelings more than a key. I hope you don\u2019t teach your children that losing things by accident equates you single handedly destroying the environment by a one off mistake. Seems I\u2019ve somehow destroyed the environment and not the major companies that continue overproducing and taking advantage of the general populace. But man, what do I know?\n\nWhere did I say don\u2019t look for it? I said it has less value than a sentimental ring to me and that you should try to Locate it, but no one should be punished over an accident. It would be a shorty life if we were constantly punished for mistakes we made or accidents that happen every once in a while.

Why would she be lying about losing a key? What ELSE could she have possibly done with it?\n\nThis is just one incident, but the fact that you jumped straight to a punitive punishment over something so minor is definitely a flag at the kind of dad you may have been.

Unfair, over the top punishments over small things just make your child afraid of you. It\u2019s even worse than this is over a mistake, not even intentional bad behavior.

You could try being open and honest and actually talking with your child instead of being passive aggressive in the hopes she reads your mind and does the thing you really want her to do.", "YTA this is quite an overreaction to a simple mistake and your behavior will keep her from wanting to communicate openly with you in the first place. A more appropriate solution would be to have her pay to have your key copied at a Home Depot, or have your keys/locks replaced.", "InshaAllah just ask your daughter if she\u2019d mind having a candid conversation with you, talk to her like she\u2019s a friend/coworker, when you\u2019re able to infer that you\u2019ve got her interest ask her if she\u2019d mind if you spoke about this \u201cteaching moment\u201d explain to her what exactly you\u2019d like to teach her through this experience, allow her to ask her questions and sincerely answer them.

I still remember the glee in her eyes, and I didn\u2019t understand it until I was walking home with my younger brother and sister in the sleet without a jacket.  I ended up cutting a screen to open a window to let us in after a couple of hours.  We were drenched and the temperature was hovering around freezing so our lips and fingers and toes were turning blue.
