If she lost it outside, it's gone. If she lost it in her room it will turn up in ten years when you move. There's also a good chance she doesn't know where she lost it. Don't die on this hill. Get her a new key and a better way of keeping it safe to help her not lose it. Or just switch one door to a keypad and then neither of you have to worry about it. YTA if you keep punishing her for a common teen (and adult!) mistake that's easily fixable.\n\nETA: Have you TOLD her all you want is honesty and for her to communicate? Because you punishing her over having lost it in her room is sending the message that you would be SO MUCH MORE ANGRY if she lost it outside. You're shooting yourself in the foot here, my man.", "YTA. Stopping her from going out because she accidentally lost a key and is too afraid to tell you is completely counterintuitive. She's going to go out, resent you, and not tell you when something big happens that she might really need or want your help with.", "YTA. If you want communication - communicate. It's your responsibility as an adult and parent.", "There are so many battles when it comes to kids and teenagers, is a key that takes 20 minutes to replace truly worth it? Instead of hiding agendas and placing you two at odds, it may be easier to sit down and explain your frustration in an open manner. No one can read another\u2019s mind.", "Here's a better solution instead of the terrible suggestions of just letting her get away with it and doing nothing.\n\nMake her pay for whatever it costs to get a new lock and key, and then she's free to go.\n\nThat's a very fitting punishment and teaches responsibility of not losing your keys but also doesn't leave her searching for a long lost item all weekend.", "Teenagers lose stuff all the time. I can understand that it's a little unnerving when it's a house key, and I'm not going to comment on your parenting/discipline style - having said that, you said that you want her to feel comfortable communicating with you, and it sounds like you aren't leading by example. Tell her that you want her to be honest about where she believes she lost the key. Maybe have her pay for the replacement key out of her allowance (or job, depending). But trying to call her bluff because you have a secret agenda - not a good look. YTA", "Parents overreacting to small stuff taught me to hide big stuff.\n\nYTA", "YTA \u2026. My husband and I have each lost our house keys more than once over the years.  It happens, get a backup key made and have her pay for it.  Then when she finds the original, she turns in the spare key and all is good.  \n\nBTW we found one of our \u201clost\u201d keys under our washing machine when we replaced it - 5 years after we lost it.  My husband found his \u201clost\u201d key in an old work bag when he was cleaning out a box during our last move.  \n\nSeriously this is ridiculous behavior on your part.", "It depends if that missing key can be linked back to your house. I\u2019d be going at it from that angle rather than just her lying to you.", "Okay soooo I think there\u2019s a better way to teach her that lesson without making her scared to tell you when she messes up. Get her a new key, but make her do some extra work to earn the money to get it. It\u2019s like 5 bucks for a key with a pretty design on it. Put it on a lanyard and a hook on her wall to hang it when she takes it off. Creates a good habit AAAAND shows her money doesn\u2019t grow on trees so she\u2019ll learn some responsibility!", "YTA. Saying she can't go anywhere until she finds her key seems like a disproportionate punishment. If you basically ground her for losing something small that can be easily replaced, it might make her afraid of how you would react if she lost something big or got into some kind of real trouble. She might not come to you with something that she really needs your help with. \n\nHere is my suggestion: ask her if she wants you to help her look for her key. Ask her where she really thinks she lost it. Tell her you aren't angry with her, and that if she thinks it's permanently lost and not just misplaced, that's OK too and you can go together to get a replacement. Also, ask her if she wants to brainstorm about how to make sure she can keep track of her keys in the future. Ask if it would help if you put a hook (like one of those command hooks) by your front door so she can hang her keys up every time she comes into the house. Ask if it would help if you got her a big or bright colored keychain so it's easy to spot in the future. (I'd suggest doing both, honestly. I always used to lose my keys, even as an adult, a key hook and a bright keychain really helped me!)\n\nAnd good luck!", "YTA. Have you tried, I dunno, talking to her?\n\n\u201cIs there any chance you lost it outside somewhere? If it\u2019s possible and since it hasn\u2019t turned up yet, we\u2019ll have to get the locks rekeyed so no one can get in if they have the key. In the meantime, let\u2019s go to the hardware store and you get a new key to use this weekend.\u201d Then have her be part of the process. If she\u2019s old enough, talk to her about contributing to the cost of this. \u201cSince you lost the key, how much of the bill do you feel is fair for you to pay?\u201d Knowing how much she can afford, accept a reasonable answer. \n\nYou\u2019ll be teaching her how to responsibly and easily remedy a common situation, and that honesty isn\u2019t something to be feared or manipulated. \n\nA lot of kids lie simply because they don\u2019t know what the outcome of a situation will be. They don\u2019t know if they\u2019re gonna get in trouble, if someone will be mad, if they\u2019re really fucked up or if something will cost a ton of money. \n\nThis would be more proactive, it\u2019s not a punishment, it just shows her \u201chey nbd, you can fix something even if you fuck it up.\u201d", "...keys are only 3-4 bucks 5 at most...

I\u2019m not congratulating her for it but what can you do? These things happen and will keep happening. Grounding her is pointless and will only teach her not to tell you things in fear of punishment that doesn\u2019t fit the crime.", "I suggest making her do whatever is required to get a new one made and asking her to pay for it is more in line with the offence. As others have said, I don't think this is a good hill to die on.", "YTA- because you aren't being honest either. You tell us that you're punishing her because she's not telling the truth where she lost it and you're telling her it's because she lost it. So, what are you even punishing her for?  Do you think it's clear to her? So, I think you're trying to instill some values, which is a commendable notion.. but basically... you're fucking it up. \n\nAt this point say sorry, I didn't handle this well, go get a key and some ice cream. \n\nI tell my kids all the time and it's amazing how often there are real life examples that come up and all I have to do now is say- \"Oh, lookee there kids.. what's the moral to that story?\"  And they'll say it for me... \"The coverup is almost always worse than the crime.\"  Remind them that you're there to help and guide them. To come to you with things. Then... don't get mad when they do. Work the problem, not punitively.  Now... you catch dishonesty after that.. hold them accountable. I think my kids would tell you that mostly what they got in trouble for was dishonesty, even if much of that was covering up for something else. Now, they tell me things I really don't want to know. But I know we have that trust.\n\nDo better.", "YTA. You admit that you haven't been the best father. And your solution to that is, what, punish your daughter for a mistake that many people have made? You're happy to ruin her weekend over such a small thing. You ARE being an asshole. And the fact that you are an asshole is why your relationship with your daughter has been so bad. Clearly you haven't changed as much as you think you have. She isn't lying to you; she really does think she lost it in her room. But you're determined to make her be the bad guy. You're insisting that she's lying and so you're happy to punish her until she agrees with your false accusation. This isn't a teaching moment because you're a bad teacher. All she'll learn from this is that you're a controlling asshole who falsely accused her and punished her for not wanting to admit to a lie.", "If you\u2019re certain she lost it outside the house, then the chances are very slim that she will find it. Just replace the key or rekey the house and make her cover at least a portion of the expense", "YTA. You assume she's lying. You must be perfect and have never lost anything.", "Losing a key isn\u2019t a misbehavior that needs to be corrected, it\u2019s just a mistake, rather than teach her not to lose keys, teach her to not be ashamed over simple mistakes. Gentle YTA you sound like you want to do what\u2019s right, it\u2019s just an accident", "Yta.  My son lost his keys after coming home a couple months ago.  We have both turned his room and the laundry room upside down.  Kids do stuff like this. He lost his spare set on prom night and we had to get a locksmith.  (Son paid).  All of my sons friends routinely have to crawl through a window cuz they don\u2019t know where their keys are.  This is the equivalent of a toddler spilling milk.  It\u2019s aggravating, but that\u2019s parenting.", "Yta. It. Is. A. Key.", "YTA- seems like an over reaction over a lost key. Plenty of responsible grown adults lose things all the time, it happens. No biggie, you just replace it.", "YTA, your heart is in the right place but you're going about it all wrong. Communicate with your daughter -- *tell* her you're looking for honesty. Model the type of communication you're trying to teach her. This is not a punishable offense, it's a teachable moment.  All of us adults have lost a key in our life -- fuck, dude, my hubs lost his entire keyring between the car and the house once.  Flat out disappeared into the aether, never to be seen again.  \n\nA big key of good parenting is to establish natural consequences. A natural consequence of losing your key is not to get punished.  It's having to go through the hassle of getting a new key cut or calling a locksmith when you're locked out.  So let her experience those consequences.  Go to Lowe's with her and get a new key cut.  If she doesn't have a key, don't let her go out later than you go to bed because you're not gonna get up to let her in.  Those sorts of things.", "YTA. You basically are gonnamakeher lose friends over a fucking key. You do understand keys are like... 2$?", "YTA. We have all done it. Use your words to communicate since that\u2019s what you want from her. Stop playing games.", "YTA. Instead of trying to help your teen find the key, you punish her by basically grounding her. It feels a bit unjustly when you've could've just talked to her about and come up with a solution of either trying to look for it or going to get the new key.", "YTA\n\nI mean if she looked and looked then she did what she can do. \n\nShe may not KNOW where and when she lost it. That's pretty normal to not know exactly when and where you lost something. \n\nAll kinds of responsible adults lose things like keys ON OCCASION. \n\nIf it becomes a habit, you find a solution (gps tag). \n\nBut punishing her for a simple mistake bc you ASSUME she's lying is a BAD move. It equates you liking or not liking the answer with punishment and not teaching her to COME to you if she made one and realizing that mistakes are normal. If there are real consequences, yes, she is responsible / accountable -- but this isn't that and isn't teaching that at all.", "YWBTA for the approach you described. \n\nInstead just tell her she is responsible for getting a new key. Have her check online for how to get a copy. Assuming this is just a typical house key (not from like an apartment complex where its not allowed to make copies), this is dead simple and absolutely something a teenager can figure out. Have her find out where to go to do it and how much it will cost (and she can pay for it). You might consider driving her where she needs to go to do it.\n\nDon't make it some weird battle of wills though where you're trying to get her to admit she lost it outside of her room. You want to teach her healthy communication, BUT YOU AREN'T MODELING HEALTHY COMMUNICATION.", "Just remember, it's possible one of your house keys is someone else's hands. You should seriously consider changing the locks.", "YTA. My parents tortured me in a different way over a key I lost when I was 12. It's just a fucking key, it's like 4$ to replace. Mistakes happen.", "if u want to treat her well and mend ur relationship, this is too much. \n\nYTA", "Yta.  If you don't want to be an AH about it then why are you being an AH?", "This seems like you're dying on this hill for no big deal. If it can be easily replaced then say just that and have a conversation about making sure she keeps better track of her belongings, especially her house key in the event that she needs to get in the house and you're not home. \n\nYou're making this the wrong teaching moment. Tell her she can't go anywhere until you *replace* the key and then take her to wherever to have a key cut and make her pay for it.\n\nYTA.", "NTA. I don\u2019t know what the fuck is wrong with everyone here but losing a key is a big deal. If she did lose it outside anyone could have it right now. Anyone could use it to get into your home. Make her find the key or admit she lost it elsewhere. If she did lose it out somewhere you need to get the house rekeyed.", "Not letting her go out because she lost a key is... a huge punishment. Would you give yourself house arrest if you lost a key? No? Then how on earth would it be a teaching moment? Get a new key and let her pay for it (or half of it, depending on the cost). That would make it an actual consequence (because paying for a new key would actually happen in real life) instead of a punishment that has nothing to do with what she did.\n\nAnd as someone else said... punishing her this way would NOT lead to her telling the truth. Because if this is a lighter version of the truth and you give her house arrest or a leisure time restriction as punishment for a perceived lighter misdeed... what would she think would happen to her for a perceived more severe misdeed? She would feel like you'd \"kill\" her (aka verbal, emotional and/or physical abuse. That is a valid fear, even if you now might think \"I would never do that and she should know\". Nope. It's still a valid fear)\n\nEdit: forgot verdict. YTA", "Give her a chore that you can correlate (I.e. Cleaning out the entryway so that there is a neat place for everyone to store their keys) and call it a win...the upcoming weekend is too pretty to wage a war with your kids if you can avoid it. \nNAH", "I\u2019d suggest a different approach as for me it\u2019s a safety issue. \n\nThe consequence of losing a house key is that the locks that work with that key need to be rekeyed. So let\u2019s try to avoid that. \n\nI\u2019d offer to help her look for her key (without judging the state of cleanliness or lack there of). Put on some music, look for the key, chat with your kid. \n\nIf you still can\u2019t find it after an hour or two, it\u2019s probably not going to be found in a reasonable timeframe, so rekeying is needed. \n\nSince she lost the key, she gets to handle the mental load of dealing with rekeying. This isn\u2019t punishment or \u2018teaching her a lesson\u2019 type of punishment. This is literally showing her life skills needed to know what to do when the unexpected happens. How to rectify the situation. Mistakes happen. So step up and work together to fix it. \n\nShe can do some online research as to reliability of a few locksmiths in the area. Then she can call around to a few locksmiths based off of her research and check on their availability, document the availability and cost. She may need some help with this. I\u2019d be fine sitting in the room or being generally around if she needs help. \n\nThen she can give you her list of two or three recommendations and you can call one to make the appointment. You need to do this part as the homeowner. \n\nShe can assist with some chores to put a bit more toward the household for a few weeks since you\u2019re having to incur the expense.\n\nUnless she\u2019s shown a blatant pattern of irresponsible behavior and disregard for the household I wouldn\u2019t even raise the idea of her paying for it (assuming you can absorb the cost). \n\nI think helping her to navigate the consequences of her mistake can help her in the long run to be more responsible, and can actually bring you closer rather than pulling you apart. \n\nIt\u2019s really easy to yell when we get mad or say harsh words, so if that already happened I\u2019d apologize for my behavior and would say it was the frustration but I\u2019ll try not to react that way again. I\u2019ve calmed down and thought about it and I think we should approach the situation differently. \n\nShe may need some time to process if there was a big argument. \n\nI\u2019d suggest doing the searching today because locksmiths may not be available on a holiday weekend, plus time is of the essence for safety.\n\nGentle YWBTA because I think what you\u2019re suggesting is a punishment rather than an opportunity to rectify the situation and help her to be honest and open with you. If your goal is a strong relationship, to help her navigate life, and to make sure the house is secure, grounding her is totally counterproductive.", "YTA but it is worth it. My mother was an AH until I learnt to be honest with her but she was also clear on communicating all she wanted was honesty. Now if your teen tells the truth, don't punish her regardless of where she has been. For me telling the truth made me immune from being grounded for whatever stupid thing I've done. By the end of my high-school years, I'd go to my mom for support when i had a problem. As an adult, I have a wonderful relationship with her and feel like I can tell her anything. I appreciate now all of the embarrassing moments and sacrifices she has made. I hated her temporarily to love her forever. It hurts (idk how many times she has gone to bed crying because I was an AH too) but it will get better. \n\nIn fact, I tell her she was too lenient on me because house chores were never big on her agenda and now I struggle as a young adult just keeping my place mess-free.", "INFO: Is this the hill you want to die on?", "You don\u2019t plan on replacing locks though?\nWhat if it was stolen by someone with the purpose to enter your house?\nOr it was lost near your home so a burglar might figure it belongs to your house? \ud83e\udd14", "NTA.

If it were my kid, and she hadn\u2019t found it by the end of the weekend, I would take her the next day to have a new one made, but I would make her pay for it with her allowance or saved birthday money or whatever. This is an important lesson for her to learn - she can\u2019t expect other people to bail her out as an adult, and you\u2019d be setting her up for failure down the road if she doesn\u2019t learn responsibility. \n\nTo be clear, I don\u2019t think this makes her a bad kid or anything of that nature.

She's going to attempt to hide any future losses from you, because in her eyes, losing things in the offense here.\n\nPerversely, your drive for honesty leads instead to an increase in dishonesty, because she misunderstands why she's being punished.\n\nIf I may offer up a suggestion for OP... don't think of this situation as \"you vs. your daughter.\" Instead, think of this as \"both of you vs. the problem.\" The problem here is that your daughter lost a key. The solution could be simple (make a new copy) or complex (get your house re-keyed because you live in a neighborhood where you think that is a safety concern).\n\nBreak down the problem. Figure out what your ACTUAL objectives are (presumably, you want honesty from your daughter and a new house key), and explain that.\n\nIf you tell her this in so many words, explain \"I grounded you because I wanted honesty, not the key back, but now I realize that I didn't make that clear,\" and figure out a solution while both of you are on the same page, you will strengthen your bond rather than harm it.", "This. Also might consider showing them your post here. It seems like you do care, just really are at a loss here.", "> Make her pay for whatever it costs to get a new lock and key, and then she's free to go.\n\nThere's a good chance that would mean replacing all the locksets in the exterior of the house, plus deadbolts.", "That was going to be my suggestion. Have her pay for the key and a portion of any locks you might feel like needing to change. Socking them in the wallet always seems to drive things home for folks of all ages.", "THIS RIGHT HERE.", "I feel that. My mom has BPD and my dad is a malignant narcissist.", "What if the key was stolen by someone on purpose? There's no \"it depends,\" this is a personal safety problem.", "Also stay on her ass about it for a week or 2 so it becomes habit to never take it off unless it\u2019s straight to the hook in the house she had to unlock to get in lol", "I have talked to her and she assured me it's in her room. She's 17 and I even told her I've misplaced my keys before and have straight up lost my wallet numerous times. Im just trying to see how I can make this a teachable moment. I posted on here to avoid being an asshole. I haven't told her she can't go anywhere just here to get advice. Growing up in foster homes and having no true guidance I'm just trying to do what's right. U, along with a lot of people here are not seeing I'm trying but tbh as long as I know I'm trying is all that matters.", "My point is to not punish her. If you read my comments you will see this. I have not punished her I just simply am asking for advice.", "Click the link in my post dude and keep calm.", "Unless they key has the house address printed on it, there\u2019s no way anyones gonna figure out which house it goes to lmao. That\u2019s such an over reaction. Keys get lost, it happens. OP clearly isn\u2019t concerned about that or he\u2019d have the locks changed already.", "If he were so worried about the house being burgled with the key, he would have had the locks rekeyed already. This isn\u2019t about that for him, it\u2019s about teaching his daughter a lesson through passive aggressive means.", "If she lost it outside and if anyone could have it by now, how on Earth is she going to find it? Sorry but I think it\u2019s unrealistic to expect someone to scour every corner of where they have been to find it when, as you mentioned, it could be anywhere and anyone could have taken it. Just sounds like a tremendous waste of time. The house should be rekeyed immediatly and skip all this needle in the haystack", "Who on earth has their address on their house key, because they deserve to be robbed. \n\nAnyone who finds it who is inclined to break in, is going to break in, key or not. No one has time to go around to every house in the neighbourhood and try the doors, whilst somehow trying *not* attract attention by walking up to every door. Far better to spend that time checking out which houses have lots of small expensive stuff or whose letter boxes are full.  There are so much easier ways to break in than finding the random house that matches the random key.", "Given that she may have lost it outside of the house having to give up her social life for a weekend to find it isn\u2019t a horrible, huge thing.", "sadly, storing keys by the entry way is not safe.", "this is entirely beside the point. whether this happened or not, there's nothing that can be done now. the options are replace the locks or get her a new key. dying on this hill would be stupid for OP.", "Have you ever clicked the link in my post?", "Click the link in my post :)", "And for the future get one of those coathanger thingies for keys. Right behind the last door she unlocks when getting home.\n\nAnd perhaps a key beeper.", "Thank you. I will talk to her about the importance of replacing it sooner rather than later. I appreciate y'all seeing I am trying to do what's best for her not to just punish or let her get away with this. She's graduating soon and I just want to make sure she's prepared", "Yes there is, and that's what needs to be done.", "I think the thing to teach here is \u201cwhat to do when you can\u2019t find your key.\u201d\n\nI really can\u2019t overstate the important of problem-solving-based teaching rather than punishment for accidental damage/expenses. \n\nWhen I was a teen, I spilled some nail polish remover on the dining room table and it ate away a small circle of varnish (smaller then a quarter). I was grounded for a month and had to write essays about \u201cresponsibility\u201d and stuff like that. I didn\u2019t learn anything from that and at almost 40, I still don\u2019t understand what I was meant to learn from that. It was an accidental spill. I still spill stuff, it\u2019s not like it taught me not to spill anything. If I were the adult in that situation now, my reaction would be \u201cokay, now we\u2019re going to learn how to refinish a table.\u201d", "A better teaching moment might be just taking her to get the key replaced and showing her how it\u2019s done so she\u2019ll know what to do next time she needs a key replaced. Punishing her for an honest mistake isn\u2019t necessary", "> I told her she can\u2019t go anywhere this weekend until she finds it\n\n> I haven\u2019t told her she can\u2019t go anywhere just here to get advice\n\nSo, which is it? Did you already tell her or not?", "That's right, OP. People are being crazy harsh about this.", "Do you even hear yourself?  You are punishing her for a simple error/mistake.  You can call it anything you want....but you are still an asshole and the only thing you are teaching her is to not trust you and to never tell you anything.   If your goal is to continue to be a crap father go for it, but at least be honest about it.", "You literally are punishing her because you told her she can't go anywhere until she finds it. You've grounded her.", "You\u2019re literally punishing her. If you read your own post you barred her from going out. That\u2019s called a punishment.", "Your point is some mind games where she's losing by default because you, a grown up, can't communicate your thought process to your child.", "You ARE punishing her though by telling her she can\u2019t go anywhere until she finds her key. That\u2019s basically grounding her for a simple mistake. You say you just want honesty and communication, just say that to your kid instead of playing these weird mind games.", "This is a good part of the conversation to have actually. Like, you haven\u2019t found it in your room, so you have to consider the possibility that you lost it outside. Where could you have lost it? Was it lost with anything that has our address on it? Could it have been found by someone who knows where you live?", "Hows joe criminal gonna know what house that key belongs to?", "Because the kid may be _lying_ that it's lost in their room, when the reality is that the door (or house) may need locks rekeyed.\n\nOP needs to explain the personal security implications of lost keys, make sure kid sees some natural consequence -- like paying for (some or all of) and participating in the rekeying of the affected locks. And maybe OP needs to help his kid with a system so that it's harder to lose/leave keys.\n\nImagine if she'd done this in a dorm or apartment building? The fees can be high, depending on the lock system. Or they could be trivial. Or merely punitive, depending on the building and owning entity.", "Okay... can you explain to me what that would teach her? What exactly would she do with it in the future? What would she learn?", "I really think you need to stop framing this as punishment / getting away with something. She didn\u2019t DO anything. Just lost a key, happens to most of us at one time or another. She may actually believe it\u2019s in her room or may indeed be fibbing to buy time because she\u2019s afraid of your reaction, but that\u2019s really on you if your kid doesn\u2019t trust you with something an innocuous as a lost key.  It\u2019s just an accident and a very fixable problem. Punishment really shouldn\u2019t come into play here.", "Are you dense? How is she getting away with this?? Omg how horrible your daughter \u2026 lost a key? She didn\u2019t even get drunk or do drugs she lost a key and this is how you\u2019re reacting. Wow", "I'm starting to feel like she can't wait to get away from you", "Yeah, but you're treating her like a baby. \n\nI lost my keys Hella times. Just give her your key and have  her go make herself her own copy . \n\nYou're stressing too much on the honesty part. Trust me, I was like that too. Stressing it makes it much worse and has the opposite effect.", "Always remember OP: this sub is filled with 13yo giving this advice.\n\nGood luck.", "How does one \u201cget away with\u201d losing something?", "Accidents happen.  If you lost your key you wouldn't punish yourself, you'd just go out and buy new locks.  Your daughter is afraid to tell you things because you punish her for mistakes.  Sit and think about that for a moment.  When you'd give more grace to yourself than your teenager for a mistake then there is something seriously wrong with you.  Have her pay for the replacement lock and do not ground her", "Replacing all of the locks over a lost key is completely overblowing the situation. If it is lost outside the house people will have no idea what the key is for. Besides most residential locks are easily picked. If someone wants to break in they won\u2019t need a key. Locked doors only stop crimes of opportunity. The sorts of people a locked door would stop are the same sort that won\u2019t bother trying to find the door that matches a key they found.", "I don't think OP should punish his daughter by forcing her to pay for multiple locksets, plus the time to replace all the locks.", "I had to word this post like that or I couldn't have posted to get the advice I needed", "I have not talked to her about it. She's at school rn and I plan on talking to her when she gets home. I was going to tell her she can't go anywhere this wknd until she either finds it or tells us she lost it so we can replace it but didn't want to be mean over a key so I posted here for advice. Make sense?", "Right!?!? I can hardly figure out what key goes in what lock of my own and have plenty of year old mystery keys \ud83d\ude05 shits unrealistic. You don\u2019t find a generic key and have some radar of what house it goes too lmfao. They\u2019d go to jail trying to break in shit before ever getting close to the right deadbolt.", "Yeah, imagine punishing your child with some nonsense instead of, you know, actually SECURING your house afterwards...\n\nIs your logic even... logic-ing?\n\n>Imagine if she'd done this in a dorm or apartment building?\n\nWell, I do imagine. I do. And paying fees would be the appropriate consequence. Not some mind games to assert dominance and punish for an accident.", "It'll teach her to look for her key. \n\nEveryone's acting like he's threatened to chain her up in her bedroom without meals or contact with the outside world. He's saying \"you can't go out until you find it\". She'll spend a few hours searching and cleaning her room, eventually say \"Dad, I can't find it\". They'll cut a new key and life will go on. Relax. Not everything is child abuse.", "Did not know this lol thanks", "Yeah. What she contributes should be reasonable factoring in how much money she actually has and I\u2019d make her part of that conversation. What does she feel is reasonable for her part in remedying the problem?\n\nMaybe a reasonable solution there would be that OP pays for the rekeying or lock replacement, and she pays for extra keys to be cut for everyone.", "Who should pay for re-keying the house?", "Except you don\u2019t communicate with her. She lost a key. Why don\u2019t you ask her if she lost it, tell her you want honesty, won\u2019t be upset, and even if she lost it she won\u2019t be punished because it wasn\u2019t like this is reoccurring or have malicious intent. She feels like she\u2019ll get in trouble which means she\u2019s come to you before about something small or out of her control that you\u2019ve punished her for. Her not being honest because she thinks she\u2019ll be punished is a reflection on you, not her. You won\u2019t get honesty out of her by punishing her, be supportive and make her feel comfortable enough to talk to you", "Gotta remember it's the internet. Hell, I myself am a 45yo basement troll who has never had kids and has no clue about this situation. So you just never know on reddit lol\n\n(also why I didnt offer advice. I will say, as a kid who continually lost his bus pass when my parents didnt have money to replace them: I get why you may be thinking of this in terms of 'punishments'. Again: good luck.)", "I don\u2019t think a rekey is necessary in this situation. Like worst case scenario a stranger finds the key. They would still have to find the appropriate house/ door. Unless it is super obvious what the key is for people are just going to leave it alone.", ">Who should pay for re-keying the house?\n\nI mean, OP is going to pay to re-key the house if he decides to do that. His daughter should be made to help with that effort. Maybe she even pays him back for it. \n\nBut there are plenty of things kids can do that result in the parents needing to spend money to fix it. Not all those things can be paid for by the kids - in fact, most likely can't. Like, my 8-year-old destroyed a sofa with liquids. It was entirely her fault. But I would have to take all her birthday and Christmas money for YEARS to pay for a replacement. Practically speaking, I had to pay for it."]}
