My wife of 7years has always had this odd quirk about her where she .. without sugar coating it , likes to copy others. I\u2019ve attempted to softy talk to her about it but it\u2019s been a trigger for her because her parents always got on her about being a \u201cfollower\u201d. \n\nThis tendency of hers has blown up between her friends because of their patience with it running out. When I say copy others some examples off the top of my head are 1) she will completely switch up her lifestyle to match someone she just met or is becoming friends with. After going out only one time with her coworker she came home with this desire to get her nose pierced. I\u2019ve known her for 9 years. Never in that span of time has she shown interest in that. This is common with her. 2) She tends to act like she originated ideas that others share with her and will \u201cforget\u201d it was mentioned. 3) She will buy exactly what her friends have. Same color, same model..exact product and say she liked it for a long time and never wanted to buy it till recently. When talking about this stuff she often replies with \u201cehh I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t care\u201d. \n\nThis leads to the issue that blew up. Her friend I\u2019ll call her Anna decorated her porch for fall recently. My wife liked it and the next few days basically replicated our porch into Anna\u2019s porch. Apparently in their group chat things blew up and they accused her of constantly copying them. They share themes with each other through that Pinterest app so I guess it was long known what all of them were planning. Anna is annoyed that she put a lot of time into the decor only for it to be \u201cstolen\u201d. She presented me the argument and I was  honest and agreed that our porch is in fact similar to Anna\u2019s porch. The wreath is the same product. Pillows the same. Pumpkins. All it. I can\u2019t deny it , however I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth all this fighting. I then suggested maybe switch it out with different colors than what Anna did and just say she admired her work and didn\u2019t mean to offend her.  I thought that would be a simple answer to this petty issue. \n\nMy wife blew up and asked why I didn\u2019t just marry Anna since her work is so nice. Reddit , I wasn\u2019t trying to make this damn thing worse. Maybe I f*cked up and if so I\u2019ll own it. But I genuinely thought being honest would maybe give her a different perspective and end the issue . It gave her the wrong perspective. She still ain\u2019t speaking to me.\n\nEdit : Thank you all for the helpful insight Didn\u2019t realize this is something to consider therapy about. Makes sense. A lot of sense. Will definitely be talking to her about it. She\u2019s always been against it in the past but I will try to approach it differently.", "created_utc": 1695601017, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16rdapd/aita_for_betraying_my_wife_with_honesty/", "score": 283, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I think it would help for her to speak to a therapist.\n\nYour suggestions were entirely rational. Your wife's reaction was not.\n\nIt's obvious that this is a pattern of behaviour that her friends have noticed too, and for them to call her out on it means they have likely had enough. Your wife needs to own her actions and, if she wants to change, needs to get some professional help.", "NTA. Honesty is key in a relationship, and it sounds like you were trying to be constructive rather than critical. It's concerning that your wife's behavior has been affecting her friendships, and as her partner, you should be able to express concerns. It's also worth noting that her reaction to your honesty suggests deeper insecurities that might benefit from professional counseling or therapy. She might need help understanding and addressing the root of her copying behavior and the reasons she's so sensitive to it. It's important for both of you to communicate openly and consider seeking couples therapy if the issue persists.", "NTA\n\nTo OPs wife, bc I hope you show her all this:\n\nI would suggest therapy to work on these issues. You are going to push away those who love you over and over. Whoever you are authentically is worth loving and being around. You don't need to copy others in order to get positive attention or praise or compassion. I promise, if you be yourself you will continue to be loved and cherished. Your husband loves you for who you are and that is a hard thing to come by. Don't lose it over some porch decor or a nose ring, etc. <3", "This is deeply upsetting behaviors on your wife's part. While it's fine to admire folks, copying them is just... creepy, wrong, stalkerish, the basis for the movie Single White Female...\n\nThis needs professional help. Your wife needs therapy. I do not understand why some folks do this, but I would imagine there's a lack of self-confidence.\n\nI think Anna was totally wrong for lassoing you into their bickering though.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nGive it a few days and see if it soaks into her brain.\n\nIt sounds like her friends and sick of her constant copying of their ideas and lives.  I wonder why they haven't dropped her yet.\n\nMy only suggestion is to suggest counseling so she can figure out why her self esteem is so low that she feels a need to copy everything others do.\n\nGood Luck", "NTA, your wife has a weird uh, thing going on and I don\u2019t think it would be helpful for you to pretend it isn\u2019t going on. I\u2019m not going to say she\u2019s ~crazy~ or anything, I\u2019m just going to say it sounds intolerable and the constant deflection wouldn\u2019t exactly endear her.", "NTA, sounds like your wife lacks a personality so adopts that of others. Met many people like that. They are all exhausting.", "NTA, she probably got so upset because you\u2019re her partner, and often we (wrongfully) expect our partners to always be \u201con our side\u201d. Sounds like your wife doesn\u2019t have a lot of faith in her own taste/ideas/creativity or a concrete identity, coupled with years of her parents criticizing her for it.", "NTA. Your wife might benefit from therapy, maybe to see why she isn't happy with who she is and why she's constantly spending all of her energy trying to be everyone around her.", "NTA. This situation is very, very weird. It sounds like she is very dependent on outside social validation and won\u2019t do anything herself until she sees it work out well for someone else. Really insecure behavior. Please encourage her to seek therapy to delve into this", "OP this copycat behavior is definitely having a negative effect on her relationship with everyone in her life, and it's definitely relate to her insecurities in being an independent person by making her own choices.  If possible try therapy, even going as a couple to at least make it so she doesn't feel personally attacked, because it's just going to keep burning bridges in her friendship group.", "Nta", "NTA. Your wife is a chameleon. She automatically changes to match her surroundings to avoid predators. Simple logic isn't going to change this defensive behavior.\n\n As others here have mentioned, this calls for professional help. If you can possibly get her into counseling, whether individual or couples, do so.", "NTA\nPeople who do this often do because of their background. Needing to fit in so perfectly they don't realize that others see it as copying or not having any original ideas. You suggested she use her friend's decorations as inspiration rather than outright ripping them off, and that is reasonable. Unfortunately this might be very deep seated.\n\nTry telling her you would love to see her express herself more. You know her friends, you didn't choose to marry them.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That\u2019s concerning\u2026", "NTA, but your wife is mirroring constantly, and after a while, people are going to get sick of it or just plain freaked out. She needs therapy to understand why she does this and to help her start being her own person. There is probably a very deep root issue that was never correctly addressed that started this behavior.", "NTA. There is nothing you could have said that would have been the right thing. \n          \nIt's also not just you who is noticing this, your wife is losing friends over it. I think some therapy might be in order so that your wife can figure out how to be herself.", "NTA but her actions and response to you show that she is a *deeply* insecure person. She could really use therapy to deal with her one sided codependency.", "I agree with the other commenters re: therapy. But, also, as an autistic person who has had to learn to avoid copying others because of the (accidental on my part) boundary-stomping/creepiness: has your wife been evaluated for neurodivergence?", "NTA \n\nAs others have said this is almost definitely issues with her self-esteem and insecurities. I went through this exact thing with my ex-wife. It was a constant battle as she burned her way through mommy group after mommy group. She got so bad that one week she would say she hates certain things, but as soon as she learned someone in her group liked said thing, then it was the best thing ever. She never saw it as a problem even after losing friend after friend", "I'm not terribly creative either but I think there's a big difference between getting an idea from the internet and directly copying someone *you know* and even worse--just met.\n\nShe's trying to fulfill... something. She may not even know what it is. Or she's incredibly impulsive and lacks the social awareness to realize copying people to this extent is creepy, not flattering.\n\nNTA for OP.", "Tell her Anna does therapy\u2026", "NTA,\n\nBut this is a case where the options you listed work out. No one is actually original, some are just better and bringing enough things together that it's hard to tell. Try supporting her, but with alternatives that aren't phrased as to be deliberately different. Like, oh, friend a got a stud on the left nostril? Say she'd rock a Ring on the right. Say you think you should go more spooky with the fall decor, add some skeletons. There is some quote out there in the world thats like, originality is about hiding your sources. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am also someone who has a hard time describing what i like without it being a copy of someone else ive seen or known. Mirroring is natural, and sometimes people get lost in it, be it for lack of confidence or other reasons. If you just make sure you get some input, make some changes that you like \\[doesn't matter if you care or not, since the point seems to be to settle these issues amongst you two and her + her friends\\], itll create enough difference that everyone has to accept 'Well i thought what you did was so cool, i figured I'd do something similar' as a response without getting mad.   \n\n\nAlso though, i agree with what someone else said that seems like a deeper issue for therapy too, but that is probably not a convo to have now/soon based on what you said the response was. Honestly everyone should be in it if able, at least for a few months.", "NTA - your wife\u2019s behavior would turn me off so hard. She needs professional support in not turning people off her. Ironic since she does it to be liked. Good for you for being honest with her. She needs a wake up call.", "NTA. She needs therapy.", "NTA. She seems to not really have a true sense of self, which makes me feel so sad for her. I think therapy is a great idea if she\u2019s interested as it could help her to feel more empowered about who she is and what she likes rather than copying others\n\nGood luck OP and fam!", "Is Anna available?", "NTA and therapy for this one. \n\nBecause you do know what\u2019s going to happen when Anna gets divorced, right, OP?", "NTA. Wifey hasn't fully come into her own self. Sis needs to think about that and find a way to stand in her own agency.", "NTA and if you have trouble getting her to therapy just have one of her friends say they're going so your wife will go.", "NTA and I'm very surprised your wife has any friend left. My daughter does this but she's 8 YEARS OLD.\nThe most worrying thing, beyond her very insecure and childish behavior, is that she seems to lie and have serious anger issues when confronted. \nIt's not a quirk, it's a serious character flaw", "NTA. You're trying to help in the nicest way possible. It sounds like her friends are sick of it, and if she doesn't change her ways soon, she could lose her friends over this.", "NTA", "OP i hope you see this. after reading your edit, just tell your wife that Anna or whomever is in therapy.  That way you can ensure that your wife will go to therapy.\n\nNTA", "NTA, it sounds like you\u2019re doing your best. I will say though - while I get that her friends are probably tired of being copied, I think a grown adult getting upset that someone \u201cstole\u201d their porch decor is\u2026 well. I can see how a comment or two on the similarities could have blown up into a \u201cyou always do X\u201d outburst that your wife took as an attack. But unless your houses are on the same street or your wife is posting photos all over claiming she designed it, Anna maybe needs to just chill and remind herself that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.", "Agree. This isn't simply copying. This is unstable self identity.", "As a recently diagnosed neurodivergent myself, masking my first few decades, therapy finally got me answer/awareness.  The stuff I have recently learned about my diagnosis, which I wish I knew my entire life, would have prevented so many frustrations and confusions similar to OPs.  Life is easier to navigate now actually knowing how I operate.", "NTA.  This may be \"mirroring\" . It can be a symptom of a personality disorder.  Protect yourself the best you can and be prepared for anything.  Confronting her about her behavior may lead to her completely rejecting you.  Be prepared for all hell to break loose e.g. false accusations of abuse etc if you do confront her.\n\nPeople with personality disorders will avoid therapy.  They will often turn their problems back at you.  If you say you think she has a problem she may claim that it is actually you who has the problem.\n\nTherapy rarely works with personality disorders.   The sufferer will often do anything to deny they have a problem.  There is no rationality with people who have personality disorders.", "NTA, my sister has a similar habit of copying the people around her, I find it annoying but I don\u2019t comment on it tho I worry it might get her in trouble one day", "NTA\n\nIt sounds exhausting to be a partner of a chameleon.", "NTA. I bet your wife had a rough childhood. I have this impulse too and have learned to suppress it. For me it comes from constantly being ripped apart by my parents. I lost my identity in trying to please them. I would see other people looking all whole and confident and think I want that. I would copy what ever it was they were doing or wearing without realizing what I wanted was my own identity that had been torn apart for so many years. I\u2019m getting there but still on occasion find myself buying things I don\u2019t need because they feel like the kind of thing a person who has a strong identity would have. Even though it\u2019s not really what I want.", "If a woman asks you to be honest about something get laryngitis. \n\nNta", "NTA\n\nUnfortunately, your wife is. I wouldn't eben mind that much if someone copied my work/idea, but I'd be pissed if they pretended it was theirs in the first place. If she continues doing this she is risking her friendships for good. \n\nI value people in my life for who they are. Somebody basically existing by creating a Frankenstein copy of their friends wouldn't appeal to me long term. I am not saying this to bw cruel, but to point out why your should seek help and learn to figure out who she is.", "Nta, im ngl ive met people like your wife and they tick me off. Adopting mannerisms is one thing, copying is another, and copying while pretending this was you/yoyr idea or whatever all along is just disingenuous.", "Agreed: This sounds like ADHD to me, especially the \"getting excited about a new thing and then completely dropping it later\" and \"forgetting where the idea came from\"..\n\nThe suggestions about insecurity and weak self-identity upthread also make sense.", "Yeah. But once she finds out about you you're going to end up with OP's wife instead.", "The piercing is what I would say pushes it there for me. A semi-permenant body mod (you will have a little scar if you let it heal, then take it out) decision out of nowhere is not a good sign at all imo.  \n\nGlad for his update, hopefully wife is receptive to the idea of therapy, but with how she reacted to his pushback, I'm worried for him and how she'll respond."]}
