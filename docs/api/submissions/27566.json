My wife of 7years has always had this odd quirk about her where she .. without sugar coating it , likes to copy others. I\u2019ve attempted to softy talk to her about it but it\u2019s been a trigger for her because her parents always got on her about being a \u201cfollower\u201d. \n\nThis tendency of hers has blown up between her friends because of their patience with it running out. When I say copy others some examples off the top of my head are 1) she will completely switch up her lifestyle to match someone she just met or is becoming friends with. After going out only one time with her coworker she came home with this desire to get her nose pierced. I\u2019ve known her for 9 years. Never in that span of time has she shown interest in that. This is common with her. 2) She tends to act like she originated ideas that others share with her and will \u201cforget\u201d it was mentioned. 3) She will buy exactly what her friends have. Same color, same model..exact product and say she liked it for a long time and never wanted to buy it till recently. When talking about this stuff she often replies with \u201cehh I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t care\u201d. \n\nThis leads to the issue that blew up. Her friend I\u2019ll call her Anna decorated her porch for fall recently. My wife liked it and the next few days basically replicated our porch into Anna\u2019s porch. Apparently in their group chat things blew up and they accused her of constantly copying them. They share themes with each other through that Pinterest app so I guess it was long known what all of them were planning. Anna is annoyed that she put a lot of time into the decor only for it to be \u201cstolen\u201d. She presented me the argument and I was  honest and agreed that our porch is in fact similar to Anna\u2019s porch. The wreath is the same product. Pillows the same. Pumpkins. All it. I can\u2019t deny it , however I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth all this fighting. I then suggested maybe switch it out with different colors than what Anna did and just say she admired her work and didn\u2019t mean to offend her.  I thought that would be a simple answer to this petty issue. \n\nMy wife blew up and asked why I didn\u2019t just marry Anna since her work is so nice. Reddit , I wasn\u2019t trying to make this damn thing worse. Maybe I f*cked up and if so I\u2019ll own it. But I genuinely thought being honest would maybe give her a different perspective and end the issue . It gave her the wrong perspective. She still ain\u2019t speaking to me.", "created_utc": 1695601017, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16rdapd/aita_for_betraying_my_wife_with_honesty/", "score": 24, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I think it would help for her to speak to a therapist.\n\nYour suggestions were entirely rational. Your wife's reaction was not.\n\nIt's obvious that this is a pattern of behaviour that her friends have noticed too, and for them to call her out on it means they have likely had enough. Your wife needs to own her actions and, if she wants to change, needs to get some professional help.", "NTA. Honesty is key in a relationship, and it sounds like you were trying to be constructive rather than critical. It's concerning that your wife's behavior has been affecting her friendships, and as her partner, you should be able to express concerns. It's also worth noting that her reaction to your honesty suggests deeper insecurities that might benefit from professional counseling or therapy. She might need help understanding and addressing the root of her copying behavior and the reasons she's so sensitive to it. It's important for both of you to communicate openly and consider seeking couples therapy if the issue persists.", "NTA\n\nTo OPs wife, bc I hope you show her all this:\n\nI would suggest therapy to work on these issues. You are going to push away those who love you over and over. Whoever you are authentically is worth loving and being around. You don't need to copy others in order to get positive attention or praise or compassion. I promise, if you be yourself you will continue to be loved and cherished. Your husband loves you for who you are and that is a hard thing to come by. Don't lose it over some porch decor or a nose ring, etc. <3", "This is deeply upsetting behaviors on your wife's part. While it's fine to admire folks, copying them is just... creepy, wrong, stalkerish, the basis for the movie Single White Female...\n\nThis needs professional help. Your wife needs therapy. I do not understand why some folks do this, but I would imagine there's a lack of self-confidence.\n\nI think Anna was totally wrong for lassoing you into their bickering though.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nGive it a few days and see if it soaks into her brain.\n\nIt sounds like her friends and sick of her constant copying of their ideas and lives.  I wonder why they haven't dropped her yet.\n\nMy only suggestion is to suggest counseling so she can figure out why her self esteem is so low that she feels a need to copy everything others do.\n\nGood Luck", "NTA, your wife has a weird uh, thing going on and I don\u2019t think it would be helpful for you to pretend it isn\u2019t going on. I\u2019m not going to say she\u2019s ~crazy~ or anything, I\u2019m just going to say it sounds intolerable and the constant deflection wouldn\u2019t exactly endear her.", "NTA, sounds like your wife lacks a personality so adopts that of others. Met many people like that. They are all exhausting.", "NTA, she probably got so upset because you\u2019re her partner, and often we (wrongfully) expect our partners to always be \u201con our side\u201d. Sounds like your wife doesn\u2019t have a lot of faith in her own taste/ideas/creativity or a concrete identity, coupled with years of her parents criticizing her for it.", "NTA. Your wife might benefit from therapy, maybe to see why she isn't happy with who she is and why she's constantly spending all of her energy trying to be everyone around her.", "NTA. This situation is very, very weird. It sounds like she is very dependent on outside social validation and won\u2019t do anything herself until she sees it work out well for someone else. Really insecure behavior. Please encourage her to seek therapy to delve into this", "OP this copycat behavior is definitely having a negative effect on her relationship with everyone in her life, and it's definitely relate to her insecurities in being an independent person by making her own choices.  If possible try therapy, even going as a couple to at least make it so she doesn't feel personally attacked, because it's just going to keep burning bridges in her friendship group.", "Nta", "NTA. Your wife is a chameleon. She automatically changes to match her surroundings to avoid predators. Simple logic isn't going to change this defensive behavior.\n\n As others here have mentioned, this calls for professional help. If you can possibly get her into counseling, whether individual or couples, do so.", "NTA\nPeople who do this often do because of their background. Needing to fit in so perfectly they don't realize that others see it as copying or not having any original ideas. You suggested she use her friend's decorations as inspiration rather than outright ripping them off, and that is reasonable. Unfortunately this might be very deep seated.\n\nTry telling her you would love to see her express herself more. You know her friends, you didn't choose to marry them.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That\u2019s concerning\u2026", "NTA, but your wife is mirroring constantly, and after a while, people are going to get sick of it or just plain freaked out. She needs therapy to understand why she does this and to help her start being her own person. There is probably a very deep root issue that was never correctly addressed that started this behavior.", "NTA. There is nothing you could have said that would have been the right thing. \n          \nIt's also not just you who is noticing this, your wife is losing friends over it.
