My wife of 7years has always had this odd quirk about her where she .. without sugar coating it , likes to copy others. I\u2019ve attempted to softy talk to her about it but it\u2019s been a trigger for her because her parents always got on her about being a \u201cfollower\u201d. \n\nThis tendency of hers has blown up between her friends because of their patience with it running out. When I say copy others some examples off the top of my head are 1) she will completely switch up her lifestyle to match someone she just met or is becoming friends with. After going out only one time with her coworker she came home with this desire to get her nose pierced. I\u2019ve known her for 9 years. Never in that span of time has she shown interest in that. This is common with her. 2) She tends to act like she originated ideas that others share with her and will \u201cforget\u201d it was mentioned. 3) She will buy exactly what her friends have. Same color, same model..exact product and say she liked it for a long time and never wanted to buy it till recently. When talking about this stuff she often replies with \u201cehh I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t care\u201d. \n\nThis leads to the issue that blew up. Her friend I\u2019ll call her Anna decorated her porch for fall recently. My wife liked it and the next few days basically replicated our porch into Anna\u2019s porch. Apparently in their group chat things blew up and they accused her of constantly copying them. They share themes with each other through that Pinterest app so I guess it was long known what all of them were planning. Anna is annoyed that she put a lot of time into the decor only for it to be \u201cstolen\u201d. She presented me the argument and I was  honest and agreed that our porch is in fact similar to Anna\u2019s porch. The wreath is the same product. Pillows the same. Pumpkins. All it. I can\u2019t deny it , however I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth all this fighting. I then suggested maybe switch it out with different colors than what Anna did and just say she admired her work and didn\u2019t mean to offend her.  I thought that would be a simple answer to this petty issue. \n\nMy wife blew up and asked why I didn\u2019t just marry Anna since her work is so nice. Reddit , I wasn\u2019t trying to make this damn thing worse. Maybe I f*cked up and if so I\u2019ll own it. But I genuinely thought being honest would maybe give her a different perspective and end the issue . It gave her the wrong perspective. She still ain\u2019t speaking to me.\n\nEdit : Thank you all for the helpful insight Didn\u2019t realize this is something to consider therapy about. Makes sense. A lot of sense. Will definitely be talking to her about it.

Honesty is key in a relationship, and it sounds like you were trying to be constructive rather than critical. It's concerning that your wife's behavior has been affecting her friendships, and as her partner, you should be able to express concerns. It's also worth noting that her reaction to your honesty suggests deeper insecurities that might benefit from professional counseling or therapy. She might need help understanding and addressing the root of her copying behavior and the reasons she's so sensitive to it. It's important for both of you to communicate openly and consider seeking couples therapy if the issue persists.", "NTA\n\nTo OPs wife, bc I hope you show her all this:\n\nI would suggest therapy to work on these issues.

I went through this exact thing with my ex-wife. It was a constant battle as she burned her way through mommy group after mommy group.

No one is actually original, some are just better and bringing enough things together that it's hard to tell. Try supporting her, but with alternatives that aren't phrased as to be deliberately different. Like, oh, friend a got a stud on the left nostril? Say she'd rock a Ring on the right. Say you think you should go more spooky with the fall decor, add some skeletons. There is some quote out there in the world thats like, originality is about hiding your sources. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am also someone who has a hard time describing what i like without it being a copy of someone else ive seen or known. Mirroring is natural, and sometimes people get lost in it, be it for lack of confidence or other reasons. If you just make sure you get some input, make some changes that you like \\[doesn't matter if you care or not, since the point seems to be to settle these issues amongst you two and her + her friends\\], itll create enough difference that everyone has to accept 'Well i thought what you did was so cool, i figured I'd do something similar' as a response without getting mad.   \n\n\nAlso though, i agree with what someone else said that seems like a deeper issue for therapy too, but that is probably not a convo to have now/soon based on what you said the response was.

Protect yourself the best you can and be prepared for anything.  Confronting her about her behavior may lead to her completely rejecting you.  Be prepared for all hell to break loose e.g. false accusations of abuse etc if you do confront her.\n\nPeople with personality disorders will avoid therapy.  They will often turn their problems back at you.  If you say you think she has a problem she may claim that it is actually you who has the problem.\n\nTherapy rarely works with personality disorders.

I bet your wife had a rough childhood. I have this impulse too and have learned to suppress it. For me it comes from constantly being ripped apart by my parents. I lost my identity in trying to please them. I would see other people looking all whole and confident and think I want that. I would copy what ever it was they were doing or wearing without realizing what I wanted was my own identity that had been torn apart for so many years.

This appears to be a long-term issue that she has had. You stated her parents considered her a 'follower', and you have noticed that she picks up and drops interests all the time based on people that she meets, and now her friends are getting upset with her.

Chameleon behaviour like that is typical of some personality disorders like borderline personality disorder and narcissistic personality disorder.
