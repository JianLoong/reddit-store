He went in your son's room and searched it! That usually is the last place you'd put something so guess what? He probably searched the rest of your house first which means he was doing this for quite a long time while you were sleeping. If he wanted to get breakfast, first of all, I assume you already have some food he could have used. Second, if you didn't have food, he could have just waited until you woke up, not spend who knows how long snooping through your house. Also, he's not even the one responding or apologizing, his brother is the one harassing you. I would press charges and certainly DON'T let this creep near or child or you!", "Nta.  If he\u2019s borrowed your car a few time before and left a note or sent a text, it might not be too much of a stretch to not wake you to ask.  Still not great, but there\u2019d at least be precedent .  \n\nAnd if he didn\u2019t know where that key was and just searched until he found it, I\u2019d be considering changing my locks, just in case.

I'd be mad if a bf took my car somewhere without permission but looking back at the guys I've dated, it wouldn't in a million years occur to me after 10 minutes that one of them had stolen my car and that I should call the cops.

He might have noticed exactly where they were, but combined with his presumption that he's allowed to drive your car, he shows a highly concerning lack of boundaries.\n\nIt was extremely foolish to not leave any sort of note or text message when taking your car, and he didn't even leave his phone on. Even with a generous benefit of the doubt, he isn't concerned with communicating with you.\n\nLastly, he's upset WITH YOU rather than being apologetic. This is the most concerning to me because it indicates that he's unwilling to learn or improve such behavior going forward. People make dumb silly mistakes, but if he's unwilling to take your legitimate feelings seriously and respect your concerns, other mistakes will be frequent and repetitive.", "NTA.  Bro snooped in your kids room, through your kids' possessions, found your car key and stole your car.  I'd call the cops in that situation.  That's literally their job.

Was your kid sleeping in his room when Kevin just started rummaging through his drawers?? This is almost making it feel like a fake story.

How embarrassing", "Again I say, regardless of whether the panic was warranted, the bf is an AH for taking the car without asking.", "Then your judgement should be ESH.", "exactly! im actually teaching my SO to drive so I dont have to wake up in the mornings to drive her. however if it was someone else im definitely calling the cops.", "OP wouldn\u2019t have even called the cops if he had answered the phone.", "If anyone took my car without asking idc if it's my best friend or an acquaintance I'm calling the cops.\n\nThis man does not have the right to take her car or any of her belongings. They aren't in a committed relationship they've been seeing each other for a few months.", "Oof. \nThat\u2019s one hell of a projection.\nAs she describes it, he tried and failed. Unless he didn\u2019t intend to return with breakfast, kind of harsh to say he stole her car. Idiot yes. Overreaction by her obviously not, but can feel for the guy who likely thought he was pulling a real Casanova move only to be taken in by the cops", "Oh you are right. I though OP texted and didn't call. Still doesn't change my point or opinion to the whole situation and behavior of all parties involved though.", "I am suspicious of a miscommunication or misunderstanding about involving OP. That is why I want more INFO. BF might have thought he had permission because OP might have told him to do breakfast without giving it much thought while there wasn't enough food in the house for example.\n\nI don't need you guys repeating the points of the other comments over and over again, I won't reply anymore to non-OP comments.", "If you take my car without permission, you have stolen it. \n\nYour comments don't change the fact your point and opinion is wrong, and I expect you to be arrested for something like this in the future", ">He argued that he thought I wouldn't mind\n\nHe made a foolish, douchey assumption. But if you really need more info, then you should edit your judgement to that; either way, a YTA judgement is unwarranted.", "If he found that, he can or could have found a lot more. Check your important items and change all your passwords. \n\nI wouldn't believe a thing that guy or his brother says.  Nta", "NTA - he never asked.   And literally stole your car.   Absolutely unacceptable.   \n\nThe fact he felt entitled to your car speaks volumes and volumes.", "This isn't the type of person you need in your house anyway, sounds like you saved future you from a liar.\n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nGenerally speaking, when you take a car you don't own without permission, you can be charged with a felony. Not a minor \"oops I made a mistake, sorry.\" The fact that he went so far as to find the key that you KEPT HIDDEN EVEN FROM HIM to take the car indicates a complete disregard for your boundaries, let alone his reaction after you discovered the vehicle missing.\n\nYou absolutely have the right to set boundaries around who has access to your vehicle and when. You are not unreasonable for calling the police when those boundaries are crossed and your vehicle is missing, along with the whole person who turned out to have taken it without permission. (Also known as stealing)\n\nIf this man wants the police not to think he's a thief, he should try, I dunno, not stealing things.\n\nDid I say NTA?\n\nNTA.", "NTA. You can't take someone's car without asking, and then expect them to know it was you, and not call the cops. He should have asked to use the car, or at the very least, left you a note, since his phone was dead. I'm sure that was embarrassing for him, but he caused it by taking your car without permission, regardless of his intention. He could have been kidnapped and they took him in the car. You had no way of knowing what was going on.", "NTA he stole you car. Let me say it again HE STOLE YOUR CAR", "NTA \n\nWho takes somebody else\u2019s car without any info on doing so? A text message or a post-it note on the counter would have avoided all of that for him. \n\nTaking the keys from the drawer is super shady.", "Hell no NTA.  You take my car without permission and you locate the key I deliberately hide?!?! The gesture would have been sweet had it not been predicated by these 2 things.", "You might want to change the locks at your home.NTA", "NTA. He went through all your things to just find the key and didn't even bother to leave a note and didn't even ask. Honestly I wouldn't be with him after that cause who know what else he's done while your asleep.", "NTA. If your keys had been hanging in the open maybe I\u2019d get it but he had to SEARCH for those keys and it is rubbing me the wrong way. You really should just cut ties with this dude", "NTA, you didn't mess up, and it wasn't stupid.  You did the correct and intelligent thing.  Who the fuck borrows someone's car without asking permission first? Not only that but apparently *searched your house* to find the car keys instead of waking you up and asking??? A shady MFer, that's who.  I hope Kevin is history for you now.", "NTA, and you should run. The way his family is reacting hints that he is lying about not having any history with the police. He crossed so many boundaries, and there is no healthy relationship recovery from this.", "NTA and I'm appalled at him finding your key -- it's very interesting that you hide it instead of just keeping it on a hook or somewhere out in the open. Do you always do that or were you just concerned about this guy in particular? Either way, I think your instincts were correct and he cannot be trusted.", "NTA.\n\nHe must have seen you put away the keys in order to find them. And if he wanted to do something \"nice\" he could make sure his phone was charged or even leave a cute note about him bringing breakfast.\n\nInstead you panicked by not finding him or the car. Realize the keys are missing, calling him with no answer, ofc you would call the cops. That is what you are supposed to do if you property is taken without you agreeing to it. To be honest he stoke it. He was and is stupid and his brother needs to back off when he wasn't there and he would probably be fuming if this had happened to him. He needs to shut it.\n\nPress charges on Kevin and make sure he learns to ASK FOR PERMISSION in order to use other people's stuff.", "NTA If he took your regular car key his story might fly but the fact that he took the spare hidden in your son\u2019s room tells me he not only stole your car but has gone through all your (and your son\u2019s) things. Thru every drawer, closet, etc. I\u2019d be checking all my valuables and changing the locks.", "NTA- This is a consequence of his own behavior. If this is his typical behavior I would question his ability to respect normal boundaries.", "NTA. He stole the car. You have hideen the Keys and he take It without your permisi\u00f3n. \nHe dont make a note, he dont let you a mesage Tell you he take the car. He is not trusth person. Please, broke with him, you don't doit nothing wrong.", "Nta. And thats why you always leave a note, at least no ones arm went flying off.", "If he really thought you wouldn't mind he would have asked. I would NEVER use someone's car, even if we are sleeping together, without express permission. That is some entitlement he is showing. \n\nHonestly, I would cut my losses, he does not understand that HIS actions caused this. To him, the blame is with you and he is wrong (so is his brother). \n\nNTA", "NTA. My hubby hides his keys in a weird spot because he is a little paranoid about people taking car keys from us. We had someone use a fob expander device to get into out shitty car. It sucked. They stole some stuff out of the car. Don't worry about people who are dogging you for putting the key in a weird place. And you ABSOLUTELY should have called the cops on that dill-hole.", "No offense but this story reeks of \u201cmom\u2019s creepy boyfriend\u201d energy. \n\nIt\u2019s really messed up that he\u2019s snooped all over your house enough to find a hidden car key in your son\u2019s bedroom. That is such a violation of privacy on so many levels. Taking your girlfriend\u2019s car without permission is always an asshole move. Period. Doing so and turning off your phone is about asserting dominance and pushing boundaries. He\u2019s following the abuser playbook by blaming you for the consequences of his actions. Any normal person would call the police when their car goes missing. A confrontation with the police is an entirely predictable outcome of stealing a car and it\u2019s a red flag that he\u2019s blaming you for his crimes. \n\nLastly, I feel bad that all of this has to be spelled out for you. This guy is bad news. I bet he\u2019s also stollen your son\u2019s piggy bank money. Have you checked?", "NTA. It was a misunderstanding but above all, he shouldn\u2019t have taken your keys without even telling you. Of course you could think it was stolen.", "NTA. Why didn't he use his car?

This guy you barely know straight up stole your car.  NTA.  At all.  I\u2019d call the cops too.", "Why do all these people's siblings and parents always get involved and initiate hostile contact w the SO. So weird to me, like wtf", "NTA I'd certainly suspect there was more going on than what was said, but you haven't given any evidence to support that. Even with what was stated, what an unbelievably entitled and awful thing for your BF to do. If I were in a similar situation I would have done almost the same exact thing and I'd absolutely dump his ass.", "NTA. Good grief Kevin. Get a grip, dude. This is an a egregious boundary violation. Good for you to call him out.", "This is called theft. This man stole your car, and you reacted appropriately.", "NTA what was his innocent excuse for how he dug the key out of the bottom of your child's dresser drawer, in their bedroom, where he should not have ever been?", "In my state its called \u201c unauthroized use of a motor converyance\u201d and is a six month misdemeanor\u2026.so yeah, he is a criminal now. Break up with him immediately.", "NTA \n\nWhat i don't get is he spent the night at your place. That makes me think his own car was parked at your place. If that is the case why not take his own car to buy groceries for a surprise breakfast or he could have left a note explaining things to stop you from freaking out.", "NTA but I just want to know what person has to hide their keys in the first place in their own home.", "Absolutely not he\u2019s the Asshole!

In the bottom drawer of a dresser no less!\n\nFar be it from me to tell anyone how to run their relationship but you might wanna set boundaries right now. Taking your car to get breakfast without confirming with you that that's what he was going to do is a red flag to me.\n\nMy husband is notorious for letting his phone die but ik for a fact that if he was going to do something like that, he'd at least leave me a note stating where he's going/what he's doing. He knows I worry too much and that I get worked up over not being informed.", "NTA. It\u2019s not a nice thing to steal someone\u2019s car. No matter if you intend to return it or not.

Let me tell you a story OP. Two and a half years ago I was with my shitty abusive ex. He woke me up in the morning asking to use my car. I said abosolutely not because he doesn't have a valid drivers license. It was early and I wanted to go back to sleep. He waited until I fell back asleep and took it anyways. He ended up rear ending someone. We are not together anymore after some really traumatic events and haven't been for the last two years, almost. I didn't report my car stolen because I didn't know it was missing, and after i found out i still didnt report because he had told me before that if i ever put him in jail he would harm me.

He should have had your express permission before he touched your keys. And why did he not use his? He doesn't get to \"do nice things\" with other people's property that he stole.

That's really weird and that's just the tip of the iceberg too he's blaming you for himself which is basically gaslighting as if it's your fault for freaking out when your car is gone without any knowledge of it being borrowed.

For curiosity's sake, it wouldn't change the fact this man disappeared with your car. I think you should talk the cops into dropping the charges, if you believe he genuinely meant to buy breakfast.

Even if the car keys had been left in plain sight on the kitchen counter rather than hidden at the bottom of a drawer in OP's son's bedroom, it is still not okay for OP's boyfriend to take the keys and the car while OP was asleep and just leave a note. Taking someone else's car for the very first time required asking for permission so that person can verify whether their insurance coverage will allow this driver and whether they're personally comfortable with letting this driver potentially damage their car and drive up the cost of their insurance policy.\n\nGranted, leaving a note might have caused OP to wait a bit longer before calling the cops. But whether or not a note is left, taking a car without asking and receiving permission in advance is breakup-worthy.", "Ohhh. That makes sense.

He also only said that after he was caught. \n\nNow this part I will say is conjecture on my part but if OP waited 10min before making the call, what do you think the police turnaround time is to send officers to find the car?  I highly doubt it was under an hour.  So why would the boyfriend have the car for that long just to buy breakfast?

Even if he can agree that he should not borrow her car without asking, he does not agree the police should be involved. Particularly true if his intentions were good. But she is not punishing him for borrowing her car without telling her. She did not have the information that he had, and she could not contact him to appease her mind. All she knew is that her car was missing, which is a pretty big deal.\n\nThat being said, I'd like to know why she was hiding the car keys. I believe it is quite unusual.
