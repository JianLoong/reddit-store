He went in your son's room and searched it! That usually is the last place you'd put something so guess what? He probably searched the rest of your house first which means he was doing this for quite a long time while you were sleeping. If he wanted to get breakfast, first of all, I assume you already have some food he could have used. Second, if you didn't have food, he could have just waited until you woke up, not spend who knows how long snooping through your house. Also, he's not even the one responding or apologizing, his brother is the one harassing you. I would press charges and certainly DON'T let this creep near or child or you!", "Nta.  If he\u2019s borrowed your car a few time before and left a note or sent a text, it might not be too much of a stretch to not wake you to ask.  Still not great, but there\u2019d at least be precedent .  \n\nAnd if he didn\u2019t know where that key was and just searched until he found it, I\u2019d be considering changing my locks, just in case.  That\u2019s not normal behaviour.", "Yeah, no. I\u2019m not sure why country you\u2019re in but in the UK you have to be insured to drive other people\u2019s cars. So this could have been a legal issue on top of him not asking to borrow it. NTA.", "NTA, so he found your hidden key and took your car? If it was hidden, obviously you didn\u2019t want him taking it.", "NTA. So he \"found\" your car key that you hid at the bottom drawer in your son's room?? Wtf. The fact that you went to extra lengths to hide your car key and he still found it and then you wake up with a missing car,  calling the cops is a reasonable response.\n\nAlso, at the very least he should have left a note or a text.", "NTA but I have so many questions?!\n\nWhat kind of people do you hang out with that you feel the need to hide your car keys when they are over?\n\nWas your son home when this happened? If yes, WTF is your son okay after someone was in his bedroom?\n\nHave you changed your locks and made sure all windows and other entry points to your house are closed and locked?\n\nDid he leave a note saying he was going to get breakfast?

For all you knew, he had been kidnapped.", "How did he get to your house?  His car ?", "NTA. He was NOT getting you breakfast, he searched your house for hidden keys stole your car and got caught.

Did you have any reason to believe he would steal your car and not return? I mean he deserves to be berated for not asking but calling the cops was extreme unless you suspected he literally wanted to steal your car!\n\nHe suck big time, he should have at least left a note if he didn't want to wake you.", "Why doesn\u2019t Kevin have his own car at 30?", "NTA, very odd he went through your son's things to get the keys, it would have been a bit different if they were just sitting out in the open or in an obvious spot.\n\nI probably wouldn't have called the police that quickly.", "Nta. He stole your car. Your car got stolen.\n\nNothing about \"seeing this guy for a month and he spent the night\" changes that. People have pretended to like me for longer than that to steal from me/screw me over.\n\nSorry you had to go through this.", "NTA. You don't take someone's car without asking. At the BARE MINIMUM, he should have left a note.\n\nAs others pointed out, it's not like you left the key out on a table.

Wtf!", "Nta and this has red flags", "NTA - first of all he should\u2019ve have known where the keys were, that means he\u2019s been going through your things. Second of all if it took that long for him to get breakfast that sounds extremely suspicious. Third of all he never had your permission.", "NTA, if you aren't in a serious relationship he has no right to your belongings.\n\nIts completely fair for you to call the cops when you can't locate your car.", "Perhaps he should have thought about the consequences before taking your car without asking and not even leaving a note. How absurd. I would have jumped to the same conclusion, especially if he didn't answer his phone.\n\nEven if he had carelessly planned the surprise breakfast he went about it the wrong way. Especially since you never told anyone where the key was. \n\nNTA\n\nFYI, I have a friend who keeps a copy of her car key in her daughter's room as a \"just in case\" situation where she has to grab her daughter and run. I think it was from past relationship issues, but not sure. Could just be a safe place to hide a spare (we hide ours in a safe).", "NTA.\n\nAre you serious? He rifled through your house to find a key. To your car. That he took. Without permission.\n\nDo you know his driving history?

I'd be mad if a bf took my car somewhere without permission but looking back at the guys I've dated, it wouldn't in a million years occur to me after 10 minutes that one of them had stolen my car and that I should call the cops. I'd be mad they didn't ask permission but assume they'd borrowed it briefly for a legit reason as long as only a short amount of time had passed.", "Um... forget him literally stealing your car, but what was he doing in your son's room where I'm assuming your son WAS SLEEPING rifling through his stuff while you were unable to intervene because you WERE SLEEPING.

Protect your child and keep this man away from your family.\n\nNTA.\n\nEdit to add: I highly doubt Kevin was getting you breakfast.

He might have noticed exactly where they were, but combined with his presumption that he's allowed to drive your car, he shows a highly concerning lack of boundaries.\n\nIt was extremely foolish to not leave any sort of note or text message when taking your car, and he didn't even leave his phone on. Even with a generous benefit of the doubt, he isn't concerned with communicating with you.\n\nLastly, he's upset WITH YOU rather than being apologetic. This is the most concerning to me because it indicates that he's unwilling to learn or improve such behavior going forward. People make dumb silly mistakes, but if he's unwilling to take your legitimate feelings seriously and respect your concerns, other mistakes will be frequent and repetitive.", "NTA.  Bro snooped in your kids room, through your kids' possessions, found your car key and stole your car.  I'd call the cops in that situation.  That's literally their job.  It's on Kevin for not asking if he could borrow your car.  Maybe next time, he will think twice before taking someone else's stuff without their permission.", "Same in most of the US.

And any accident will likely cause your future insurance policy prices to go up.", "Also info: Was there a sleeping kid on the room when he took it?", "Yeah, this is where I\u2019m hung up. Was your kid sleeping in his room when Kevin just started rummaging through his drawers?? This is almost making it feel like a fake story.

SO of 26 years who I own and operate a company with, with company cars \u201cHey Fifi, do you mind if I take your car to pick up blahblahblah because the roads where I am going are bad and my I have low profile tires and don\u2019t want to get another flat and then have you call CAA again?\u201d Me: \u201c Oh gawd you don\u2019t have to tell me the whole story, just a heads up and leave me your car keys\u201d See, someone I\u2019ve known for 26 years always asks - not too hard - that BF is super suspect", "Okay my bad, but I just feel like what she did was a little overboard but I can assure you I'm not high!", "how?", "Your idea of romance is to steal someone's car (the key being in a secret place in her son's bottom drawer)????\n\nWow. Not many words for someone like yourself. \"Future sex offender\" are some", "Oof, someone didn't read the post properly where op describes trying to ring him. How embarrassing", "Again I say, regardless of whether the panic was warranted, the bf is an AH for taking the car without asking.", "Then your judgement should be ESH.", "exactly! im actually teaching my SO to drive so I dont have to wake up in the mornings to drive her. however if it was someone else im definitely calling the cops.", "OP wouldn\u2019t have even called the cops if he had answered the phone.", "If anyone took my car without asking idc if it's my best friend or an acquaintance I'm calling the cops.\n\nThis man does not have the right to take her car or any of her belongings. They aren't in a committed relationship they've been seeing each other for a few months.", "Oof. \nThat\u2019s one hell of a projection.\nAs she describes it, he tried and failed. Unless he didn\u2019t intend to return with breakfast, kind of harsh to say he stole her car. Idiot yes. Overreaction by her obviously not, but can feel for the guy who likely thought he was pulling a real Casanova move only to be taken in by the cops", "Oh you are right. I though OP texted and didn't call. Still doesn't change my point or opinion to the whole situation and behavior of all parties involved though.", "I am suspicious of a miscommunication or misunderstanding about involving OP. That is why I want more INFO. BF might have thought he had permission because OP might have told him to do breakfast without giving it much thought while there wasn't enough food in the house for example.\n\nI don't need you guys repeating the points of the other comments over and over again, I won't reply anymore to non-OP comments.", "If you take my car without permission, you have stolen it. \n\nYour comments don't change the fact your point and opinion is wrong, and I expect you to be arrested for something like this in the future", ">He argued that he thought I wouldn't mind\n\nHe made a foolish, douchey assumption. But if you really need more info, then you should edit your judgement to that; either way, a YTA judgement is unwarranted."]}
