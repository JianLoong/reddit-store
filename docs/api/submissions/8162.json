Everything was fine when we got there. His brother was pissy and hungover, his brothers wife was being loud as usual and his sister and new flavor as they like to call her new man because she brings home a different guy every three months. How does she find all these boys, i have no idea. So my fiance is trying to make conversation with them and nobody is paying attention to him. This isn't the first time this has ever happened. He looks at me and I start laughing out loud and I told him \"told ya, you're not the favorite\" as everyone else speaks over him and doesn't give two craps about what he has to say. It doesn't affect his as much so he just takes a sip and laughs with me. Then his sis in law turns around to looks at us and out loud in front of everyone and his mom, says to us \"What are you laughing about\" and not even one second later she proceeds with \"Oh you know what, I don't fucking care\". That threw me off. I wanted to proceed with saying than why the f\\*\\*\\* did you ask in the first place, but I didn't want to cause a scene. So I stayed quiet. I ask my fiance what the hell was that for and he says \"Oh that's just who she is\". So she's allowed to be rude? What if I made a comment like that? He says \"Oh no, you can't say something like that because then you would come off as rude and you're not like that\" What in the actual f\\*\\*\\*. So because she is who she is she's allowed to be rude? \"We all grew up with divorced parents and that taught us to have tough skin, you on the other hand don't have that\" No cuz my family actually cares about me. So everyone decides to go to Cabelas after. I said out loud I didn't want to go and waste my time, we have nothing to shop for. His sister tells my fiance not even at me that I'm sitting right next to her \"If she wants to leave she can, she can take your truck and go home and you can ride with us\". At that moment I felt like the biggest idiot being in this family. We've been together for seven years and I still feel like an outsider. They made me feel like I was in the wrong and the ahole. So we go to Cabelas and I just walk away and look at other stuff because I did not want to be in their presence any longer. My fiance eventually finds me and says \"You're being dramatic\". Wow thanks for defending me.

You have two choices here:  1. stop visiting with them, going places with them, just stop, LC or NC with them (I\u2019d go with NC but I am completely intolerant of AH like this, especially if they are family), or 2. continue playing happy family, accept they are AH and stop bitching about their behavior because you decided to tolerate it.

My biggest concern is that your fianc\u00e9 is okay with them treating you like this.  And don't think that you can change him, or that he'll be different after the wedding.  I can tell that he won't change based on the comments he made to you defending their behavior.\n\nI get that you love him and all, but this is what your life will be if you marry him.  Forever.

The other option is that she\u2019s jealous or intimidated by you for whatever reason. Nobody is mean for NO reason.

We're supposed to either go together or leave together right? Inlcuding defending each other?

As soon as I arrive they just look over and don't say anything not even a hello, or what's up. That is rude and weird to me but my fianc\u00e9 says this is normal, so I'll try to suck it up and accept them as they are. I could stay in the corner and they could care less. I've done it before at their thanksgiving last year, i sat by myself in the living room and they all were in the kitchen messing around. I moved to the kitchen and it was like I'm not there, they talk amongst themselves but not with me. I tend to now drive separate from my Fianc\u00e9 so I can leave when they drain me or I've had enough. Not all his family members are like that but mostly his siblings are towards me and it's awkward. I've tried socializing with them but I'm still always the odd one out. They will make remarks and comments about how I'm weird or a dumbass because my parents are still together and theirs are not, or they call them crazy for having values and my fianc\u00e9 doesn't defend me because he agrees with them so I'll leave. But it has gotten to the point where I'm tired of staying quiet and being the \"dramatic\" one when I don't agree with them.", "What, again?", "You seem to be placing the blame on everyone but your SO. He doesn't want to rock the boat & is rationalizing everything his family does to be \"normal\". The reality is they don't care for you or your SO that much. Why even attend the events when they don't even hang out with you? \n\nI could see if your SO defended or integrated you into his family, but 7 years later, has your relationship with them improved? Your SO has no spine & he will always put his family before you. \n\nIf you think Im being irrational, think how they will handle your wedding, pregnancies, family deaths, etc. Do yourself a favor and reassess your relationship with a man who has no spine that will not have your back regarding anything with his family. If you can't stand them now, you think you can continue this facade for the rest of your life?", "You're not being irrational at all. You have a good perspective that I haven't been able to see clearly. Thank you."]}
