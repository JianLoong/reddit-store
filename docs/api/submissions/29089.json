Bill then made a comment along the lines of \u201cGirlfriend? But you\u2019re a girl, you\u2019re supposed to have a boyfriend, not a girlfriend.\u201d I was still polite and simply told Bill that as long as they make me happy, why does it matter what gender my partner is? Class then started and he walked away for a little bit.\n\nAbout halfway into class, we move into another room temporarily and while we\u2019re there, Bill comes up to me again and looks mad. He proceeded to tell me \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be my romantic partner! Mine!\u201d I was shocked and kind of disturbed because he said it so angrily. I turned to my friend that I\u2019m supposed to stand next to, tell her the situation, and we switch spots until we move back to the other classroom.\n\nAt the end of class, as I was leaving, he was staring at me and I found it creepy so I left the classroom as soon as I could. I met up with another friend outside and let her know about the situation. She told me that something similar had happened to her with Bill last year. She could tell I didn\u2019t feel comfortable so she walked me to my car in case he came out too.\n\nI normally wouldn\u2019t think twice about something like this, but this is a classmate that we know is mentally not all the way there.

If he approaches you again, I would simply and politely tell him that this is not appropriate and he needs to stop asking questions or having this behavior.  Document that too.  If it happens again, go to a guidance counselor.", "NTA\n\nJust because he is special needs does not excuse his behavior and actions. If he is acting and engaging with you in a manner which you feel unsafe and uncomfortable to the point that a friend walked you to your car so you wouldn\u2019t be alone if you bumped into to him. \n\nI suggest documenting this event (make sure it has all the w\u2019s - who, what, where, when, and why). Also, tell someone at the university about it (professor, teaching assistant, etc.) just so they can keep an eye out and make note of his behavior toward you or other students(since this is not his first time). \n\nThis will help establish a record/timeline of these events so if for some reason he does this again or escalate his actions/behavior towards you. It would also make it harder to brush this off as a \u201cone time incident\u201d when it wasn\u2019t (since you did tell someone at the university). Bill needs to learns that this is not acceptable and gets the assistance he needs.\n\nThere could be a chance that Bill will not bother you again.  However, there is a chance that he won\u2019t and it could get worse (stalking, harassment, etc.) especially when he has a history of this behavior. \n\nIt might seem extreme to you and others but had enough experiences to make me the type of person who would rather be safe than sorry and prepare for the worst case scenario. \n\nAgain NTA for having those feeling and they are valid whether they were caused by a person with or without special needs.", "NTA\n\nI was told all through high school that the ND boy who sexually harassed and groped me didn\u2019t know what he was doing as well as some generic boys will be boys lines. \n\nI communicated very clearly why it wasn\u2019t okay and it eventually escalated to stalking and him trying to break into our house. \n\nYes, he may struggle with social cues but his behaviour is inappropriate", "NTA.\nBill is smart enough to be in college, one assumes he is going to be seeking employment and will have to deal with HR one day. \n\nHe won\u2019t be able to do this with future work mates.\n\nGo to whoever your pastoral care person is.\nBill clearly had some scenario in his mind where you were straight and single and would be his girlfriend if he just asked nicely. He was upset reality didn\u2019t match up, and he didn\u2019t act appropriately.\n\nHe needs to be told it was scary for you and that when your head stuff and real world stuff don\u2019t match, you can\u2019t blame other people or take it out on them.\n\nHe\u2019s not 5.\nHe doesn\u2019t get a free pass to be homophobic and threatening without at least being told that what he is doing is unacceptable and afforded the opportunity to change and make amends. \n\nIf he doesn\u2019t understand or accept that he was wrong, or your college doesn\u2019t at least address his behaviour with him, then he is too risky to be left unsupervised in a class with women. \n\nHe just shouted at you. \nWill it just be shouting the next time his fantasy girlfriend rejects him?", "No, you are NTA for feeling violated and uncomfortable in this situation. It\u2019s important to recognize and validate your own feelings and emotions. It\u2019s also understandable that the comments and behavior from Bill made you feel uncomfortable and violated your personal boundaries.\n\nIt\u2019s also important, though, to remember that individuals with special needs (such as Bill) may struggle with social cues and appropriate boundaries. However, it *is* still necessary to address and address behavior that makes you feel uncomfortable or violated.\n\nFeeling violated or uncomfortable is a natural response to a situation like this, regardless of the other person\u2019s special needs. It\u2019s crucial to prioritize your own well-being when needed. **NTA**.", "You\u2019ve got to tell someone, definitely NTA, but there\u2019s lots of gray areas with special needs folks.", "NTA, he asked if you had a romantic partner and he got mad over being told that you have a girlfriend, saying that you were supposed to be his \"romantic partner\". That is straight up incel behavior. What's more disturbing is he did this to a classmate too.\n\nIf you can gather evidence of his creepy behavior, report him to an instructor or the Dean of Students. If he did this to other girls in your class then he has to be reported.", "NTA\n\nHe disregarded your right to choose your own romantic partner and claimed ownership of you, like you are an object instead of a person with her own feelings and choices. It is perfectly understandable that you feel uncomfortable around a guy who views like a possession.\n\nKeep a record of things like this in case his behavior escalates. According to your friend, he has a history of treating women like this.", "NTA if any man, or woman for that matter, got pushy like this I would be having a conversation with my college advisor.", "Why the hell do you feel like a bad person? That's terrifying, what he said. Just because he has special needs does not mean you should be okay with him treating you with predatory behavior. \n\nNTA. Please stay away from him.", "NTA but \u201cviolated\u201d is abit strong you weren\u2019t violated at all but being uncomfortable is fair, just talk to the teacher or whatever about it and they can relay the message home and work with him on it aswell.", "NAH. He may not have yhe capacity to socially filter his thoughs, but you have every right to feel the way you do.  The best next step is to talk to a teacher or counselor. It's on them to create a safe place for all. Even though the college isn't required to have an IEP, your classmate may have a service plan from a state agency, and the college should be able to refer to that.", "NTA but Violated seems a bit extreme given the circumstances. You acknowledge that this person is mentally challenged so just chalk it up to that. I do think you should report his behavior though so someone who is properly trained can help him with this unacceptable behavior and prevent it from happening in the future.", "NAH, as I don't think we know what all is going on with this guy. I don't know if he can appropriately comprehend what he did wrong. But that doesn't have anything to do with your very valid feelings.", "I wouldn\u2019t go so far as to say you\u2019ve done something wrong, but if he is special needs he may be struggling to understand various social situations like this.  I would just refer this to someone who specializes in dealing with these sorts of situations.", "This feels off. You're in college and in the same class as someone who seems like they have intellectual disabilities. Someone with intellectual disabilities is in college? Can you elaborate on the situation?", "YTA for thinking him being \"mentally not all there\" is going to make him assault you or something. I promise you you're far, far more likely to be assaulted by a neurotypical mentally healthy person\n\nWhat he did was not okay and you should definitely be concerned but it isn't because he's special needs", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Report him.  This isn\u2019t your high school, this is a campus that is responsible for your safety and chooses who to admit.

Not that I agree with it, but it's a very different thing when a five year old boy insists that you're HIS girlfriend than when a 19 year man does. Some, not all, but some special needs people that focus on intimacy/romantic partnerships have an unhealthy awareness of sex and consent, and he could pose a very real danger. The worst part of that is, he could do something and you'd wind up being the bad guy in the public eye because 'he's not aware of what he's doing/he's special needs'. And it's a slippery slope of if some types take advantage of that or not.\n\nDocument it.

I don\u2019t think he purposely tried to make me uncomfortable by any means, he\u2019s normally very nice, he just took a conversation too far and made not so appropriate comments. By no means am I saying that him doing that caused him to \u201cassault\u201d me. I\u2019m just asking for an outside opinion if I\u2019m a bad person for the way I feel about the situation I was put in.

Some of these can help students who would otherwise have difficulties in college classes.\n\nThird, they do not segregate those of us with disabilities from neurotypical students in colleges. We attend the exact same classes as everyone else.", "It is perfectly possible to be clueless that women can like women romantically - but be able to do high level mathematics.
