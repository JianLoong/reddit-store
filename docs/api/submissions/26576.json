You think keeping that from your daughter is being a loving father? What's wrong with you?", "YTA\n\nInstead of being honest with everyone, you just allowed a disruption to occur with no context or explanation. Either be honest with everyone, including your daughter, or just don\u2019t get involved. \n\nAlso, if your daughter\u2019s husband is flirting with a relative while drunk, imagine what he does when he\u2019s out by himself. You are the ultimate AH for allowing your daughter to be ignorant of her husband\u2019s behavior. She will not be happy when she finds out you didn\u2019t say anything to her and will think you were helping him cover up his (potential) infidelity. You are incredibly dense to think keeping his actions from your daughter will keep her happy - if anything, you come across as untrustworthy and not being respectful of your daughter\u2019s happiness because you\u2019re essentially telling her hubby it\u2019s okay to cheat just not in front of the family.", "YTA", "YTA for keeping this secret. Your daughter's happiness isn't worth ***covering for her husband being unfaithful.***  What would you think happens if later on it came out that you didn't tell her when you could have?", "NTA for getting him to leave.\n\nIt could have been handled better though.\n\nYou should have told your daughter why you were demanding that he leave.", "YTA, \"John had a bit too much and is acting pretty confused, I'm worried he's going to cause a scene or get someone hurt if he doesn't go and sleep it off\" all you needed to say.

Why do you owe loyalty to this man you don't even like?", "Nta", "YTA\n\nYou needed to tell your daughter to take him home because he was too drunk. And why the hell didn\u2019t you tell her what he was doing to her cousin\u2019s wife???\n\nApologize to your wife and tell your daughter what really happened. If your niece in law is comfortable, she should tell your daughter what happened.", "You are a dip sh*t for not talking to your daughter about his drinking.

You don't love your daughter as much as you think.", "Your credibility and relationships aren\u2019t worth holding your tongue in certain relationships if that is the case.

You realize covering up for a creep making passes at a young woman only helps the creep, right? Your whole \u201cI couldn\u2019t say anything because I love my daughter and her happiness\u201d routine just meant that you left Laura hanging out to dry and your daughter still has no idea her husband is a creep. If anything you\u2019ve driven her closer to him.", "YTA for not telling your daughter.

You should\u2019ve just told her the truth about what happened. You say you want her to be happy, why doesn\u2019t she deserve to know the truth about his actions so she can make the decision to find real happiness?", "YTA for not using your words in the first place.  If he was drunk and you are throwing him out how was he supposed to leave by himself?  Why not be honest with your daughter about what is going on in the first place?  Also they brought their child-(your grandson) with them, why do you make this distinction sound so weird?  You created this chaos by again, mot using your words properly.", "NTA. Your wife needs to grow up.  Adult.birthdays are no big deal. What is more important is that your guests are comfortable and not harassed by idiots, even if they are in the family.  Tough luck.

This is the father of your grandchild. Your daughters love. You knew it was going to cause a scene, did so anyways & didn't tell anyone why. Almost feels like your justifying it now. Why wouldn't you pull your daughter or wife aside, tell them what happened & let them decide how to proceed? Humiliating him in front of everyone with no explanation is never the right call. Be careful because you may end up pushing your daughter & grandson away in the process. \n Find a way to bond or at least be civil. We had a rough start w our son in law. now, even after the divorce, we love him like our own. Wouldnt trade him for anything. Took a lot to get here but very proud of the man he has become. The greatest gift you could give your daughter is to accept him. Hes your grandsons daddy, he isnt going away.", "I personally don\u2019t think the ordeal with the niece occurred at all because I think the daughter would have been notified of the sil actions. I believe that the son was drinking too much, maybe became too much of a problem for dad so dad used it as a excuse to kick sil out of the event. Otherwise why wouldn\u2019t you tell your daughter of her husband\u2019s actions? Because he would have been lying to her and that would have been even worse than what was already occurring.

Nah.", "He let his daughter leave without knowing her husband was sexually harassing a family member. Rock the damn boat and tell her the truth!\n\nETA imagine how nephew's wife feels.

Yes that is a great plan (sarcasm)\n\nYour daughter is an adult and she deserved to know immediately what her husband was doing. You should have pulled her aside and say hey \"I saw your husband flirting with your cousin\". Instead you decided to hide it.\n\nYou should have told her immediately the second you saw.\n\nThe husband is drunk that was bad for kicking him out. What if something bad happened to him. Your daughter would have blamed you. You should have called a taxi/uber or lyft and paid to have him brought home.\n\nYou hiding what you saw is hurting your daughter. She deserved to know what her husband was doing.", "Yes", "YTA. are you dumb? Why wouldn't you tell your daughter? So he can hit on other girls at other parties?", "YTA trying to force him to leave and then drive drunk is incredibly inconsiderate and shitty of you. WHAT IF HE WOULD HAVE KILLED SOMEONE!?
