Fine. But now you stumble upon a significant mess up by John, and you tried to process it with that very mantra.. which was to remove John while trying (too) hard to respect Sara\u2019s love bla bla by concealing the reason for said removal.. turns out it was a bad move, confused the hell out of everyone.. and now you\u2019re the AH. Missed an opportunity to let some puss out of that abscess in your family, bro.. And now is a bit late. But hey, the way John is going, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll have an other one in not too long.
