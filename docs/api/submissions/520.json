Your post is so hard follow I can't really figure out what is going on here.  I can decipher that you said you were looking forward to the cake so your mom should not have given it to your dad so she was wrong.

Your mom for being...whatever way she is being. That would be seriously annoying.", "Your post is so hard to follow. But from what I've gotten, she either gave your cake away or pretended to as a prank. Both are asshole behaviors. NTA", "INFO\n\nDo you often struggle to eat certain things?", "Basically my mums not happy which I mean I would say as usual cause a few days back I had to deal with her saying \"why are you leaving me I bet you wouldn't care if I died.\" But essentially i had a cake wanted the cake told people not to eat but then my ma gives it to my dad it gets eaten, I ask my mum doesn't understand why I made a fuss I got a new one but then she wouldn't stop giving digs towards.\n\nWith the vaping I know it will kill me I honestly know I'm gonna die at one point so I might as well do the things want and enjoy it life's to short, I know my lungs could sink in I know I could get cancer I'm aware I've just gotten to the point, if I can't live up to expectation I'm not gonna be good enough in my ma's eyes I'm not gonna be good enough in life.", "This is still hard to follow and so immature. Dude you have some growing up to do regardless of whatever is going on in this post.\n\nAlso stop vaping. And maybe move out.", "It sounds like your mum has a lot of issues.  What about your dad?  Is he any better?  Maybe you should think about moving out?  \n\nAs far as the vaping; don't ever think like is short and I'm going to die anyway.  You are only 19.  Your life has barely begun.  I had a brother that always thought that way and he only lived to 36.   If you feel like you can never live up to your mum's expectations go to counseling.  You have a lot of potential.  Your mom has a lot of issues but let her her pass them down to you.  You can't force her to get better but you can get yourself better."]}
