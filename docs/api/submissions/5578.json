His girlfriend is literally the sweetest girl ever but she is also shy and quiet. So the best friend was ofc commenting about how shy she is and how better than her she(best friend) was.The sentence :\u201dI don\u2019t know who likes her when she is that way\u201dwas what was just too much for me. I finally said to her to shut up and how rude she was to me and my cousin\u2019s girlfriend. It\u2019s not funny.\nMy cousin took me and her on the side and tried to calm us down but well it was a little too late. She just kept telling me that she\u2019s just really honest and honesty sometimes hurts but this was bullshit she was just acting rude.I told her that if she\u2019s jealous bc of how I look like she should just ask for few styling and makeup tips but if she\u2019s jealous bc my cousin picked another girl over her to be his girlfriend that is her problem (for the back story she has huge crush on my cousin since like 2020 she told him that but he already had a girlfriend) she yelled at me that she is not jealous and that we are actually rude to her and I should be ashamed bc of it. \nI wasn\u2019t going to just let her go easily I wanted her to apologize to me and my cousin\u2019s girlfriend for bringing down other girls to make herself look better and just being rude but I couldn\u2019t even finished my thought bc she stormed of and called her mom to take her home.\nAfter this our dinner was a bit awkward but not for long.after she left we opened our presents and just hang out together.Until her mom called my uncle to tell him she\u2019s crying bc of me.Everyone after this said that I was too harsh and I should actually apologize to her if I don\u2019t then I\u2019m the asshole here.well mabey I really was too hush idk i think she had to be called out", "created_utc": 1671928136, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zumn7n/aita_for_making_teenager_cry_at_the_christmas/", "score": 52, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
