We weren't best friends but we were pretty decent friends and enough so that we stayed in touch afterwards and I got invited to her wedding. Now I only got invited, I wasn't in the bridal party at all or anything and all I had to go off of was that I couldn't have a white or cream colored dress, which is fair and understandable, I'd never think of wearing anything close and have seen enough stories of how that can go completely wrong. \nI chose to wear a black dress that was strapless and showed off the shoulders but was still tasteful and what I felt was appropriate and I didn't think there would be any problems with it, I even sent a pic of it to her but never got a response so IDK if she even received the message. Come the day of the wedding everything is fine up until the reception when the bride comes up and tells me that my dress is inappropriate and that I shouldn't have worn it. She said it was untasteful and I honestly should have known better. I told her that I sent her a picture and she said that she hadn't seen it. She says that I'm just looking for attention and that I'm an asshole for it. We went back and forth for a bit before I just decided to leave as I didn't want it to go farther but I'm curious AITA?\n\nEdit: I will say I was the only one in strapless and in black, other than guys in tuxes of course, and my dress was shorter than everyone's only going to my knees and not to the floor.

It could mean too formal, not formal enough, wrong color, too flashy, too revealing, not her personal favorite style of cut, not from this year's runway shows, who knows. If she had one of these as a criterion, it was her responsibility to say so before a guest shells out hundreds for their dress and innocently shows up attired in what is otherwise perfectly respectable cocktail attire.
