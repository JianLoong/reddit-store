This has been building up inside of you for all this time? This is such an absurd overreaction that I wonder if there's more to this story.

You're punishing him because you accepted the stepmother as your new mom and he didn't. She's mom to you. They're your parents. He doesn't feel the same way about her, which is perfectly fine, but you can't handle that. \n\nGo ahead and exclude your brother from your wedding. It's your right.

Your brother was not obligated to accept your stepmom as his mother. Was he wrong to throw a fit about it as a child, maybe. But he was a teenager and was clearly struggling.

You chose to, he never needs to see her like that - she isnt his mother, shes the wife of his father. His mother existed, she lived, she will never not be his mother. No other woman needs to have that title. It must have destroyed him to watch his father forget his mother.  He was so young.
