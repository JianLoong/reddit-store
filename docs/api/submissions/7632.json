You need to consider your brothers feelings in relation to your stepmom. I assume you were both younger when your dad remarried. You brother likely had a lot of hurt feelings around your mothers passing and acted out when your dad remarried.

This has been building up inside of you for all this time? This is such an absurd overreaction that I wonder if there's more to this story.

You're punishing him because you accepted the stepmother as your new mom and he didn't. She's mom to you. They're your parents. He doesn't feel the same way about her, which is perfectly fine, but you can't handle that. \n\nGo ahead and exclude your brother from your wedding. It's your right.

Your brother was not obligated to accept your stepmom as his mother. Was he wrong to throw a fit about it as a child, maybe. But he was a teenager and was clearly struggling.

You chose to, he never needs to see her like that - she isnt his mother, shes the wife of his father. His mother existed, she lived, she will never not be his mother. No other woman needs to have that title. It must have destroyed him to watch his father forget his mother.  He was so young. And you should be adult enough to accept that.\n\nAnd you say your stepmother was heartbroken well he a child was heartbroken that his mother was being erased by his father and you.

The OP said her parents have urged her to reconsider. There is nothing to suggest her stepmother encouraged this, but you seem to be filling in the blanks and making them fact", "OP says her **parents** are asking her to reconsider. I don't see anything about stepmom supporting this.", "Oh don't be ridiculous, as long as her kids like who she likes and hate who she hates, all will be well for the kids.\n\nThe kids better remember, she held a grudge for 12 years against her brother for what he did when he was 13.", "In this case it\u2019s the reverse, with the older sibling accepting and the younger one rejecting. Gender may have played a role here, if OP appreciated bonding with a female role model while her younger brother felt he was fine without.", "Yes. OP thinks she\u2019s standing up for her mom but is actually causing more issues.", "If he has any self respect, he wouldn't. \n\nBut I'd love to read \"I sent an invitation to my brother for the 2nd wedding but he asked who TF are you \" in relationship advice or something", "Lol, that was unintentional.", "Just as he chose not to go to that wedding for his own reasons being that he was hurt, she can also make the decision not to invite him because she is hurt. I wonder if the brother never accepted the stepmother as apart of the family.", ">I got the same impression, that the stepmother was probably encouraging or enabling this atrocious behavior.\n\nReddit Try Not to Demonize Stepparents Challenge (IMPOSSIBLE)", "Exactly. My guess is SM just related to OP better....did things that a young girl would like together... and brother was a lost child.", "OP considers her stepmother her mother now, and calls her 'mom' a few times in the post. Her bio-mom died, and when her father married her stepmother she became Mom to the OP. When OP uses the word \"parents\", she's talking about her father and stepmother. Her biological mom died when her brother was 13, so ten years ago I think? OP keeps referring to her stepmother as \"mom\" so it's really confusing to read.", "Her mom died when she was 10. Parent is in reference to dad and stepmom", "Hurt at what? Something that was between other people?\n\nThe relationship between him and the stepmother is not hers to manage", ">I do think there's more to this story as well, but I'm confident it would only make OP look worse. \n\nNot necessarily, I mean, if the 13yo brother was that pissed at his dad for remarrying you know he had to be angry with his 15yo sister for daring to like her. Someone that resistant to change doesn't act against only one person in the household. It would be nice if OP gave some more details but it doesn't seem like she really has a good relationship with her brother. I think people have the right to not invite people they don't want to celebrate with no matter how closely related they are. And just because he's now 25 doesn't mean that OP isn't afraid that her brother won't make snide remarks at the wedding or be dismissive of their step mother when OP treats her as mother of the bride. Just not enough info about their relationship other than it's strained.", "I 100% agree with this.  When people leave out info it\u2019s because they\u2019ll look like an AH.  The small chance they\u2019re not is because they\u2019re honestly terrible story tellers and don\u2019t understand what info is important.", "She also lost her mother and found solace in her stepmother, he rejected that relationship, do her own feelings not matter?", "Thank you! I got downvoted on a sub once because I said parents should never talk shit about other people in front of their kids. My mom talked shit about my dad and his side of the family nearly every day (not an exaggeration) after the divorce and it killed relationships I could have had with my amazing grandparents, dad, and step mom. My grandparents died before I learned the truth: that my mom was mother gothel, a horrible narcissist. I still lament at the relationships that could have been\ud83d\ude22", "I'm thinking it's two polar opposite coping strategies to coping with the death of a parent. One accepted the new parental figure, the other rejected hard -- OP could very well hold a grudge he didn't embrace SM as she did. \n\nThis is my armchair psychoanalizing here.", "The step-parent hate is hard core here. I got lucky with an awesome step-mom. She was fun, but not in a fake way.  Never tried to overstep, and was there to help if needed.", "There are cases when a post initially got NTA but as the OP adds more info in the comments and sometimes edits, the tide turns against them.", "Of course they do. But he rejected that relationship for HIMSELF, not for her. He did nothing to slight his sister. I understand she is upset on behalf of her mother, but mother doesnt need her to fight that fight for her. She doesnt want her to. OP is putting intent and emotion on other people and then justifying her anger over situations that only exist in her head.", "It sounds to me like OP handled grief by over attaching to the step mom, while the brother handled it by rejecting the step mom. Both are understandable reactions for children who\u2019ve lost a parent, and it sounds like the step mom has been understanding of that (from what little info we have about her). Really it sounds like OP needs therapy to work through some unresolved grief if she\u2019s still holding onto anger over how her brother dealt with his grief when he was 13.", "Is it wrong for a girl who also lost her mother to take solace in a relationship with her stepmother and to be hurt when her brother rejected that relationship? Or does only the brother's feelings matter?", "I sort of get the feeling that this sub just hates parents, period.", "Super wrong lol", "It's perfectly fine to be hurt. To carry a grudge for 10 years while saying the relationship is repaired? No. If she is still this angry towards towards her brother, that's something that she needed to be honest about if there was any hope of working through it. As it is she blindsided her brother by still being incredibly angry.   \n\n\nAlso you're allowed to have all kinds of feelings. The problem here is how she acted on them. And that makes her the AH."]}
