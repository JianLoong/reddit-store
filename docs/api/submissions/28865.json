They live 2 states over and finally brought the baby to my parent's house last weekend where they will be staying with us for about 2 weeks. I used to get along well with my brother but ever since his gf came into the picture, we don't see eye to eye. She's stuck up and entitled and my brother always takes her side. It irritates me but since they now live like 300 miles away, I don't think about them much.\n\nYesterday, I was watching a tv show in the family room when my SIL came and sat on the couch near me. She started talking to me and she was surprisingly nice. She was asking me about my college plans and how school was. This was the first time in a long time we had a civil conversation. However, the baby started crying so she brought him to where we were sitting and said it was his meal time. She still breastfeeds him so I told her I would leave to give her privacy. She said it was okay so I stayed.\n\nWhen she loosened her bra and took out her boob to feed her kid, I felt uncomfortable. She was still talking to me, but instead of looking at her, I was looking away from her and speaking. She eventually caught on and told me it's rude to not look at someone when they're talking to you. I told her I was just trying to give her some privacy. I don't know if it's hormones or something but then she got mad and started antagonizing me. She said she's a grown woman and if she wanted privacy she would have gone to another room or told me to leave. She also called me a jerk. I said she needs to calm her tits and has no right to boss me around in my own home. She called me an asshole went to complain to my brother.\n\nMy brother called me a bunch of names and said he's going to \"teach me a lesson\". My mom also said I was out of line for the way I acted and what I said afterwards. I was only defending myself from her rude remarks.

She made no effort to have a civil discussion about it.\n\nWhere you might be called an AH: It would have been better to just have left the room then to be rude in return (= you gave her excuses for why you were the bad guy she could \"tell on\") but not responding in kind would have taken a lot of maturity (and many people would have blown up like you did.)\n\nIt will blow over.

I am a big supporter of breastfeeding being normalised. There is nothing sexual about a baby eating their meal. Breastfeeding  is like bra straps. It is a you problem if it makes you uncomfortable so look somewhere else...  which is exactly what OP did. He wasn't rude or a jerk; he just looked away. This is a perfectly acceptable compromise so everyone is comfortable. I am frankly side eyeing her as she seems to be stirring up trouble and picking fights for no reason.", "NTA\n\nYou should have excused yourself and left the exposed boob to do it's job. A lot of breastfeeding women want to expose the world to their perfect motherhood by pretending it is so \"natural\" that it should be in everyone's face.\n\nYour family is rude and a bunch of a-holes for getting angry with you.

Yea, breastfeeding is a very normal thing to do. If the woman breastfeeding is happy to do it in front of other people, good on her.

But I would encourage you to consider that breastfeeding is a totally natural process, and there is nothing sexual about it. I don't know if you're in America, but in 49 out of 50 states, it is legal for a woman to breastfeed any place she can legally be. So if a woman is in a public park, shopping at Target, on the bus, it is completely legal for her to start breastfeeding without any sort of cover. I've seen old photos from about 100 years ago of women breastfeeding their babies very openly in the middle of church. It's the most natural thing in the world, and regarding women's breasts as a purely sexual organ is a relatively recent phenomenon. \n\nI don't think it's your fault. We have all been socialized by Victoria's Secret & similar to consider women's breasts to be sexy rather than functional. Your concerns are a direct result of the world we live in today. But as a woman who breastfed, I can confirm that it gets old to have people treat you like a pariah when you're just trying to feed your baby. (Which is not what you did! You did your best.) So if you can spend some time thinking about your gut feelings around breastfeeding, considering where they come from, and whether they make sense, that would make you an extra awesome person.", "Nah. She's looking for a fight here. Who knows if you had looked at her instead of away she might have called you a creep.

Your SIL is an asshole that antagonized you based on her own insecurities.", "She is what I call a professional victim. She's hyper progressive and super into her beliefs so she wants confrontation- the problem is most people are normal so to get the confrontation she wants, she has to manufacture it. She wants to be oppressed so bad that she invents these situations so she can cry to everyone how oppressed she is \n\nSo she goes out of her way to make you feel uncomfortable so she can then attack you for not being super pro breastfeeding! You monster!\n\nHave you ever said something innocent like \"I don't like basketball\" and seen someone reply like \"so you hate black people??!!!\"\n\nThat's the kind of person she is. NTA and stay away from her. Never be alone with people like that.", "YTA and pathetic. She isn\u2019t bobbing her breasts up and down in front of you.

Stop sounding so chronically online.", "NTA, I truly believe these females that do that WANT YOU TO LOOK  at their boobs\ud83e\udd23 they want the attention of feeling special I guess, possibly wants a compliment and a cookie too.  I've always preferred privacy,  and the fact she said you were rude for not WATCHING her proves it. I've never understood why women need that much attention.

It would have even been perfectly fine for you to offer her a blanket or towel and just explain that you feel a little uncomfortable.\n\nThis wasn't a public situation of a mother feeding baby, where you could just look away, this was up front and personal. She came into your space and when you showed signs of discomfort when the situation changed (feeding baby), attacked you. \n\nAs the adult (because you're still a teen) she should have expected your reaction, and either taken the offered privacy or asked for a cover for baby and breast.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nbro, she over reacted.

I am not sure but the way you have mentioned that she was being extra nice to you out of the ordinary made me think like that.", "ESH. She was asking to look at her. She wasn't demanding you stare at her breast & the baby's mouth latched to her nipple.You're going to encounter breastfeeding women in public, so you need to realize that you can look at them without looking at their breast. Which is usually barely visible even if she doesn't cover up. Refusing to look her in the eye after she asked you to was rude & unnecessary. \n\nHer response to this was no better. She escalated when she should have simply let you leave the room when you expressed discomfort. Then, she pulled your brother and mother into it, possibly with a less than accurate description of what happened. \n\nBTW. You should have simply gotten up and walked away.

This doesn't seem the case here). So yeah, don't looking at her for the whole time seems a little extreme.\n\nHowever if someone isn't confortable while someone else is breastfeeding, he should be able to remove him/herself without any discussion. In his shoes, I wouldn't have talked about giving her privacy because if she doesn't want it, she knows better. I would have been honest and said that I was not confortable and I would have left the room. Alternatively, he could have pretended that he needed to use the bathroom.

Giving her privacy and not opening myself up to either of us being uncomfortable with whatever body parts being seen seems like a basic decency, and on the insistence that he stayed him not wanting to look directly at her for her dignity and his comfort is a reasonable compromise. Her picking the fight over it is what makes her the AH.", "\"she said it was okay so I stayed\"\n\nHow is that forcing?", "No. Breastfeeding can happen anywhere. What she did wrong was yell at him for not looking.

The third time someone I know tries to off themselves, I cut the \"caring\" cord. Not worth my time and energy to care about someone that doesn't care about me.

I think the point that many are missing here is, OP has the absolute right to look anywhere and he is not an A H for choosing not to look at someone.

He did what he needed to do he wouldn't feel weird looking at his little sister's boob even with the normal context of a tint human eating from it. He was also the first person to sit next to me in public and look like a very grumpy guard dog daring anyone to say something about my boob being out in public, and he is a former bouncer so a perfect pissed off guard dog. \n\nHonestly it brings to mind the egaming team getting awarded medals and one of the team members was Muslim and when there was a bikini model handing the medal to the awarder standing in front of him he removed his head covering and used it to block his face from seeing her. He didn't make her cover up nor did he make a stink, he did manage to only affect himself to avoid seeing something he was uncomfortable with seeing. \n\nOp was polite until his sister in law made a big deal out of it. Should he not have lashed out? Yeah probably not, but she started berating him for being a teenager who doesn't want to look at his brother's girlfriend's boobs. It wasn't like he told her she shouldn't feed the baby in his presence and she needed to GTFO, he tried to leave and then when she insisted he stay he maintained the conversation while looking away. He was fine in doing that. \n\nAnd I say this as someone who is currently feeding a two month old with my boobs. Often around other people.", "So the minor child (he's 17, so minor, child) should have to speak up and literally say \"your boobs are making me uncomfortable\", and the ADULT who has her own child has NO responsibility to respect the CHILD who already expressed his discomfort in a roundabout manner? How is a teenager supposed to know a tactful way to say \"I respect you but I'm a minor and your boobs out make me uncomfortable, which is why I tried to leave the room\", without offending the ADULT who just insisted on popping out her boobs after the MINOR expressed discomfort? \n\nI AGREE that people should be able to breastfeed wherever they're comfortable. BUT in this case OP tried to leave the room for his own comfort, the lady breastfeeding wouldn't let him, and then she threw a fit about his discomfort.
