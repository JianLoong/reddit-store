They live 2 states over and finally brought the baby to my parent's house last weekend where they will be staying with us for about 2 weeks. I used to get along well with my brother but ever since his gf came into the picture, we don't see eye to eye. She's stuck up and entitled and my brother always takes her side. It irritates me but since they now live like 300 miles away, I don't think about them much.\n\nYesterday, I was watching a tv show in the family room when my SIL came and sat on the couch near me. She started talking to me and she was surprisingly nice. She was asking me about my college plans and how school was. This was the first time in a long time we had a civil conversation. However, the baby started crying so she brought him to where we were sitting and said it was his meal time. She still breastfeeds him so I told her I would leave to give her privacy. She said it was okay so I stayed.\n\nWhen she loosened her bra and took out her boob to feed her kid, I felt uncomfortable. She was still talking to me, but instead of looking at her, I was looking away from her and speaking. She eventually caught on and told me it's rude to not look at someone when they're talking to you. I told her I was just trying to give her some privacy. I don't know if it's hormones or something but then she got mad and started antagonizing me. She said she's a grown woman and if she wanted privacy she would have gone to another room or told me to leave. She also called me a jerk. I said she needs to calm her tits and has no right to boss me around in my own home. She called me an asshole went to complain to my brother.\n\nMy brother called me a bunch of names and said he's going to \"teach me a lesson\". My mom also said I was out of line for the way I acted and what I said afterwards. I was only defending myself from her rude remarks.

She made no effort to have a civil discussion about it.\n\nWhere you might be called an AH: It would have been better to just have left the room then to be rude in return (= you gave her excuses for why you were the bad guy she could \"tell on\") but not responding in kind would have taken a lot of maturity (and many people would have blown up like you did.)\n\nIt will blow over.

I am a big supporter of breastfeeding being normalised. There is nothing sexual about a baby eating their meal. Breastfeeding  is like bra straps. It is a you problem if it makes you uncomfortable so look somewhere else...  which is exactly what OP did. He wasn't rude or a jerk; he just looked away. This is a perfectly acceptable compromise so everyone is comfortable. I am frankly side eyeing her as she seems to be stirring up trouble and picking fights for no reason.", "NTA\n\nYou should have excused yourself and left the exposed boob to do it's job. A lot of breastfeeding women want to expose the world to their perfect motherhood by pretending it is so \"natural\" that it should be in everyone's face.\n\nYour family is rude and a bunch of a-holes for getting angry with you.

So equal shares of being an asshole.", "NTA...aldo is natural to breastfeed...you are 17 and totally normal for you to feel unconfortable.

Yea, breastfeeding is a very normal thing to do. If the woman breastfeeding is happy to do it in front of other people, good on her.

But I would encourage you to consider that breastfeeding is a totally natural process, and there is nothing sexual about it. I don't know if you're in America, but in 49 out of 50 states, it is legal for a woman to breastfeed any place she can legally be. So if a woman is in a public park, shopping at Target, on the bus, it is completely legal for her to start breastfeeding without any sort of cover. I've seen old photos from about 100 years ago of women breastfeeding their babies very openly in the middle of church. It's the most natural thing in the world, and regarding women's breasts as a purely sexual organ is a relatively recent phenomenon. \n\nI don't think it's your fault. We have all been socialized by Victoria's Secret & similar to consider women's breasts to be sexy rather than functional. Your concerns are a direct result of the world we live in today. But as a woman who breastfed, I can confirm that it gets old to have people treat you like a pariah when you're just trying to feed your baby. (Which is not what you did! You did your best.) So if you can spend some time thinking about your gut feelings around breastfeeding, considering where they come from, and whether they make sense, that would make you an extra awesome person.", "Nah. She's looking for a fight here. Who knows if you had looked at her instead of away she might have called you a creep.

Your SIL is an asshole that antagonized you based on her own insecurities.", "She is what I call a professional victim. She's hyper progressive and super into her beliefs so she wants confrontation- the problem is most people are normal so to get the confrontation she wants, she has to manufacture it. She wants to be oppressed so bad that she invents these situations so she can cry to everyone how oppressed she is \n\nSo she goes out of her way to make you feel uncomfortable so she can then attack you for not being super pro breastfeeding! You monster!\n\nHave you ever said something innocent like \"I don't like basketball\" and seen someone reply like \"so you hate black people??!!!\"\n\nThat's the kind of person she is. NTA and stay away from her. Never be alone with people like that.", "YTA and pathetic. She isn\u2019t bobbing her breasts up and down in front of you.

Stop sounding so chronically online.", "NTA, I truly believe these females that do that WANT YOU TO LOOK  at their boobs\ud83e\udd23 they want the attention of feeling special I guess, possibly wants a compliment and a cookie too.  I've always preferred privacy,  and the fact she said you were rude for not WATCHING her proves it. I've never understood why women need that much attention. Definitely NTA", "ESH you were rude she was rude your brother was rude", "NTA\n\nSo if you would have look at her she would be calling you a perv.", "Yta", "YTA. You made the situation weird.

It would have even been perfectly fine for you to offer her a blanket or towel and just explain that you feel a little uncomfortable.\n\nThis wasn't a public situation of a mother feeding baby, where you could just look away, this was up front and personal. She came into your space and when you showed signs of discomfort when the situation changed (feeding baby), attacked you. \n\nAs the adult (because you're still a teen) she should have expected your reaction, and either taken the offered privacy or asked for a cover for baby and breast.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nbro, she over reacted.

I am not sure but the way you have mentioned that she was being extra nice to you out of the ordinary made me think like that.", "ESH. She was asking to look at her. She wasn't demanding you stare at her breast & the baby's mouth latched to her nipple.You're going to encounter breastfeeding women in public, so you need to realize that you can look at them without looking at their breast. Which is usually barely visible even if she doesn't cover up. Refusing to look her in the eye after she asked you to was rude & unnecessary. \n\nHer response to this was no better. She escalated when she should have simply let you leave the room when you expressed discomfort. Then, she pulled your brother and mother into it, possibly with a less than accurate description of what happened. \n\nBTW. You should have simply gotten up and walked away.

This doesn't seem the case here). So yeah, don't looking at her for the whole time seems a little extreme.\n\nHowever if someone isn't confortable while someone else is breastfeeding, he should be able to remove him/herself without any discussion. In his shoes, I wouldn't have talked about giving her privacy because if she doesn't want it, she knows better. I would have been honest and said that I was not confortable and I would have left the room. Alternatively, he could have pretended that he needed to use the bathroom.

So he shouldn't have acted like she is the one doing something that normally requiers privacy (proposing to leave to give her privacy then cutting EYE-contact for the whole time while they are talking and mentioning again privacy). If he had said that he was not confortable and left, she would have been 100% at fault for not accepting it. OP is young so I understand that he didn't know how to state boundaries while aknowledging she did nothing wrong here. And I don't think he is an AH for that but yes, he could have reacted better. And even the way he talked back to her ('calm her tits') suggest he didn't and still doesn't understand where he failed even if I totally agree that his family makes a big deal about nothing.", "He could have looked at her face.", "Still, how is it his fault or even bad if he felt awkward? All he did was avert his eyes and she got mad. Other than saying \"calm your tits\" OP did nothing wrong whatsoever. She didn't do anything wrong until she got mad at him, but that was the inciting event and not the breastfeeding. He literally was trying to give her privacy and she got mad. How is he the asshole in any way shape or form?", "They know that", "She's not legally entitled to make him watch her do it though. He didn't prevent her, he just looked away.", "So the whole time he looked away didn't scream uncomfortable to you? There's ways to tell when someone is uncomfortable by their body language. And when he didn't look at her she said it was rude, then antagonized him and called him a jerk. In his own house. That's when he lashed out and he's not an asshole for that", "How did he make a big deal out of it? By not looking? Lmao get real.", "Maybe he was trying to be respectful and not being around breastfeeding before. As he said he was trying to give her privacy and she made it a big deal.\n\n\nI support breastfeeding but I also acknowledge that not everyone is comfortable with it. If someone looked away or left the room I never made a fuss about it. As long as they didn\u2019t say anything to try and shame me.", "Yes. He's 17 and probably didn't grow up in a nudist colony.", "He lives in that house she doesn't. You know exactly what I mean. He was sitting in the house he has lived in presumably his whole life and she came into the room he was sitting. Also he merely averted his eyes, and she got mad. How mad would she have gotten if he left the room??", "If it makes him uncomfortable he shouldn't have to look at her period", "My point is her actions were in no way fucking sexual harassment", "Yeah that\u2019s why everyone involved sucks", "He was uncomfortable, he could have said excuse im gonna go to bathrooms and grab some water you need anything? There was ways for him to politely leave if he was uncomfortable. Avoiding eye contact is not actively communicating. He tried to not ownership of his feelings and tried to make it about her feelings. If he uncomfortable own that. Don\u2019t pretend its for someone else.", "Get real he\u2019s fucking 17 if he\u2019s uncomfortable hes old enough to speak up and/or remove himself without being so embarrassed by a literal infant eating", "ah, I did not notice OP\u2019s age. NTA then but it\u2019s a good life lesson to learn: breastfeeding is natural and doing it openly in public is completely legal. so it\u2019s probably best to get used to it.", "Parents\u2019 house, parents\u2019 rules. His mom isn\u2019t on his side here. \n\nShe was already there for a while when the baby needed feeding. It\u2019s not like she sat down next to him explicitly to breastfeed.", "You get fucking real. Once again she got mad at him for simply not looking lol. How mad would she have gotten if he walked away. What if he would've spoken up? What would he have said? She could've handled it much better, he simply continued sitting down and watching TV and she got upset. It's absolutely ridiculous.", "What's your point? You didn't address my last point. The only thing he did wrong was look away. If he would've gotten up and left she would've gotten just as mad if not more upset. If she saw he was uncomfortable she could've either left or just not said anything. It's not weird for him to be slightly uncomfortable. It is weird to get mad at a teenager for feeling uncomfortable in this situation. Kid did nothing wrong. Either did she until she started bad mouthing OP.", "They all could have fucking handled it better they all suck he didn\u2019t simply stay watching tv he made it fucking awkward by continuing to talk to her while very obviously turning away and making her feel as if she was doing something gross, sexual or inappropriate, simply because he can\u2019t handle a literal infant eating naturally in the same room as him.", "I don\u2019t have to address your points or engage with you. I don\u2019t have to defend my judgment. Quit badgering me, or you\u2019re the AH.", "Lmao badgering you? You're funny.\n\nLol this person blocked me on reddit for responding to their comments then accused me of badgering them. Hilarious.", "Oookay, gonna let you go find someone else to pester."]}
