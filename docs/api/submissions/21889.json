I currently have primary custody of our 3 kids (16F, 13M, & 11M).  It was not an amicable divorce and my current relationship with my ex is strenuous at best.  I have been living with a new BF for about 9-months and we plan to get engaged.  We currently live about a 6-hour drive from my ex-husband.  Our custody agreement is that the kids stay with me during the school year, he gets 1-2 major holidays a year and 6-weeks during the summer.  The kids are supposed to go to his house starting next week.\n\nThe boys are excited about it, but my daughter is not.  She is a very skilled softball player and recently got invited to join a select traveling team based out of our city.  The problem is that this team starts play in 2 weeks and plays through the end of the summer.  Meaning if she goes to her dad's for 6-weeks, she won't be able to play.  This is a huge opportunity to get seen by college scouts, which could lead to a scholarship.  She wants to stay here and play with this team instead of going to her dad's and I am fully supporting her in this.  In my eyes, she's old enough to make this decision on her own and my ex and I as parents should validate that decision.  \n\nMy ex, however, is livid.  My daughter didn't feel comfortable breaking this news to him because she was afraid he would try to make her come stay with him.  So, I was the one who made the call.  When I told him what our daughter wants to do and that I support her decision, he immediately got angry and accused me of denying him his court-appointed visitation.  He threatened to get lawyers involved if needed.  I told him that's just going to be more traumatic for our daughter and that he needs to put his ego aside and let her decide how she wants to live her life.  The call did not end on good terms.\n\nNot even a week later, I was notified by my lawyer that he received word from my ex's lawyer that he is demanding an expedited court appearance to handle this.  It also included a request to modify child support payments and to cancel or modify alimony payments.  I called my ex immediately to try and talk to him about it. \n\nI told him he is being petty and not thinking of our daughter's best wishes.  He told me that I have no idea how hard it is to only see your kids for 2-months out of the year and that he misses them and wants them all to come stay with him.  I told him he is denying his daughter a huge opportunity and she's going to hate him for it, but he doesn't seem to care about what she wants, only what he wants.  I reminded him that he's free to come stay in our city and see his daughter if he wants, but he said that's not the point.  \n\nHe then said that unless I'm contacting him to let him know exactly what time he can come pick up the kids, any further communication about this is going to have to go through his lawyer.  I just can't wrap my head around his thinking on this, but he thinks I'm an AH for not making our daughter visit him.", "created_utc": 1689023710, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14w6lvv/aita_for_supporting_my_daughters_wish_to_not/", "score": 70, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Lawyers and courts will go nowhere because her wishes will be taken into account.", "ESH. \n\nYou needed to go about this is the legal and proper way, not just call right before the start of the visit and make declarations about your daughter being able to make her own decisions. You could have also tried to negotiate. For example, no summer visit but you would provide for her to visit for several long weekends throughout the year. You would reimburse any travel costs that have already been paid out. And on and on. Not every state allows for the minors to just decide not to visit and at this point, because you didn't inform the court, didn't contact your ex with proper notice, didn't try to negotiate etc you are in contempt of court. \n\nHe should definitely be more flexible and understanding. He should have tried to work with you and he should allow her to play the summer league. \n\nIt sounds like neither of you communicate well.", "I grew up with a sister who did travel ball. It did, in fact, get her a college scholarship. Quite a good one.\n\nSetting that aside, this:\n\n>In my eyes, she's old enough to make this decision on her own and my ex and I as parents should validate that decision.\n\nIs simply not true, and some fault for the situation falls with you for not clearing this with your lawyer from the start. She is 16, only a tiny portion of states consider that age of majority and I'm guessing yours isn't one of them. Knowing the opportunity was there, you should have immediately contacted 1) your lawyer and then 2) your ex to work this out in a way that would be equitable. Sure, its for the best that she plays over summer. When will he get to see her beyond that? Some arrangement to ensure he has appropriate access to his child in alignment to the spirit of the custody agreement should have been figured out.\n\nESH\n\nYou for the reasons above, and your ex for obvious reasons you outline in your post. The fact you think you have done no wrong here is a big piece of the breakdown in communication. You don't get to make unilateral choices, and you have to make some form of accommodation. The compromise cannot be \"daughter gets her freedom and also I have full custody for the whole year.\" And if you can't see that, your lawyer probably will.", "NTA. I get where your ex is coming from a bit, especially if he is a caring parent, but he is really not looking at the bigger picture here.\n\nNot only will this possibly affect his daughters future but it will also affect his future relationship with her. Its getting to the point where she will no longer be covered by the custody agreement and, instead of trying to build the beat relationship he can with her he is alienating her and minimising the chance that she will want to soend more time with him once she is older.\n\nMy advice: as annoying and expensive as all the court stuff is, don't fight it. Get it all out in the open so that it can't bite you in the arse down the road. Be reasonable though, try to find a way for your husband to get some of that time with your daughter another way. Show him why he's over reacted in this situation and hopefully it can ease the way for things in the future.", "Absolutely NTA!  The only mistake is made speaking for your daughter though.  She\u2019s 16, she should be speaking for herself.  Otherwise, ex-husband is going to blame you.  And he did.", "NTA. This shouldn't be about what your ex wants but about what your 16 daughter wants.  In some states the courts will appoint an advocate for your kid. Ask your lawyer about that. At 16 in most states in this country courts will take the kid's preferences very seriously. A court appointed advocate can be her voice in court, which will make her standing up for her wishes in the face of her father's wrath easier. Good luck!", "He should not be putting his daughter in the position where she is scared to tell him about an exiting opportunity. He is willing to drag his family through the court (because at 16 court would probably want to take daughter's statement as well) because of his ego.", "NTA. She\u2019s 16 and can make her own decisions, I assume she must speak to him outside of seeing him so she needs to have that conversation with him. Lawyers and courts will go nowhere because her wishes will be taken into account.", "NTA\n\nHis *feelings* are totally valid. I can imagine it is incredibly hard to your kids for such a limited amount of time in a year. But he's had years to find ways to rectify it, including moving potentially closer. As kids get older, things like this happen. They also want to do more with their friends over summer rather than stay \"home\" with a parent. \n\nThat being said, ultimately, not only is this something that is good for your daughter, but it's something she wants to do. She should be able to not only do that, but be able to tell her dad without being afraid. It makes it feel like having the kids is less about having the kids and more about power or something.\n\nIs there a way to compromise. Is this soft ball thing only on certain days of the week. Could she do every other weekend visit for the summer with this?", "This is above Reddit\u2019s pay grade. Get your own lawyer.", "YTA\nPut yourself in his shoes. If he had primary custody and you only got to see your kids 2 months a year, how would you feel? In the long run, spending quality time with her Dad is more important than 1 summer of softball. You should have never supported her request and never agreed to call and relay her request to her Dad. You are court-ordered to facilitate your ex\u2019s placement, not to help your daughter get out of it. If she\u2019s old enough to make this decision, as you state, then she\u2019s old enough to ask her Dad\u2019s permission. It\u2019s more likely that he may have said yes to her. You\u2019ve really made a mess of this. Stop denigrating your ex and start preparing your daughter for the fact that she will most likely have to spend 6 weeks at his house this summer.", "NTA - at 16, your daughter is old enough to decide for herself & her dad sounds self-centered, petty, and vindictive.\n\nIf there's a brochure or paperwork explaining the softball team, have your daughter send it to her dad and have her explain the importance of the event, and how going/not going could affect her future. Let her be the one to explain things to her dad and deal with him. \n\nPrint out any correspondence, including texts, and if it gets to the point - show it to the Judge. Judges give stronger weight to the wishes of teens. \n\nI suggest that you don't have further contact with your ex, and let your lawyer guide you on what to do next. I hope your daughter gets to join the team and knocks it out of the park!", "NAH I only see 2 parents having trouble communicating with their children. If you see your daughter old enough to make this decision you should see her mature enough to break the news to her dad in order to make it right, you making the call was the mistake imo", "YTA. She is NOT old enough to make this decision. In fact, you can\u2019t even make that decision. It\u2019s a court Order. Those don\u2019t get to be ignored or change without 1)a judge saying it\u2019s okay or 2) both parties agree. Ex doesn\u2019t agree so he\u2019s doing what he has to do to see his daughter.\n\nFurther, why on earth would you call him to perpetuate a disagreement after finding out the courts are now involved? That\u2019s never a good look.\n\nI want her to play. I really, really do. But does it really have to be black and white? Is there no compromising or mature adult discussions? You just call and tell him she\u2019s not coming then act shocked he\u2019s pissed? Come on.", "NTA.  What your daughter wants should be the priority.  I believe many states will listen to the preferences of a 16 yr old.  Hope he has to pay the court costs plus your lawyer's fees if he keeps being the asshole who insists on going to court.", "NTA. Courts in many states allow kids to make their own decisions w where they stay. Especially after age 14. You may have made a mistake to be the one to tell your ex (bc he\u2019s spewing his wrath on you).\nBut your ex is 1)disregarding his daughter\u2019s wishes by demanding she stay w him, 2) is putting HIS preferences above his daughter\u2019s possible college opportunities 3) got the lawyers involved\n\nGet an advocate involved for your daughter.\n\nEDIT: to add that your ex is in for a rude surprise in the courtroom if he thinks he can put his wishes above his daughter\u2019s wishes and college future. Here\u2019s a link that discusses which states offer how much input from children in custody cases. https://www.custodyxchange.com/topics/research/custody-preferences-children.php", "ESH\n\nFirst and foremost, the reality of the travel ball to college connection is unrealistic.  Using that as a reason is suspect at best.  There are literally tens of thousands of travel ball teams and less than 2% of HS players make it to college ball.  These are pure facts.  If your daughter isn't in the top 1.75% of softball student-athletes the reality is that she's attempting to miss her visit to her father for what will amount to an \"all star\"/\"select\" experience.\n\n  \nDaughter sucks because if she's grown enough to make the decision not to fulfill court ordered custody for travel ball she should've been grown enough to call her dad herself and talk to him about it.  Also, travel ball isn't some fly by night activity.  This is something that is well planned out in advance and if she was even leaning in that direction she (and you) should've informed him well in advance and possibly changed the timing of her summer visit.\n\nMom sucks because there were better ways to handle this versus a phone call right before the visit.  Also sucks for not getting ahead of this in advance (try to offer an exchange of some sort i.e. give him first half of summer and maybe spring break/Easter and a couple 3 day weekends as a trade).  Mom also sucks for not leaving it up to the dad and the daughter to discuss it between themselves with a compromise in mind.  \n\nFather sucks because while he would be getting the short end of the stick; using child support/alimony as leverage is petty.  He could also compromise and work out more visitation during the year (2 extra holidays, spring break, more 3/4 day weekends, or all 2024 summer) in exchange for the 6 weeks.", "YTA, his thinking on this is straightforward. We have a legal agreement, and I want to see her and mom is only too happy to call and say daughter doesn't want to come and I support her. At the end of the day, your teen is a kid, and doesn't really get a vote on where she spends the summer under the current agreement. Her parents have arranged a legally binding agreement about where she will stay and when, and one party-you, has unilaterally decided to violate that agreement. I suggest you get the custody agreement modified or comply with it. Perhaps a court will support your daughters wish to stay home and change the arrangement, but I do not think it is legally wise to just violate the agreement under the guise of supporting your daughter. How would you feel if he called in 6 weeks and said golly gee your son doesn't feel like coming back he's staying here and you can drive out and visit him if you like and oh yes, you need to respect how he \"wants to live his life\" not with you? That's why he has a lawyer. Your kid is just a teen caught in the middle.", "NTA - At her age she's going to start to assert her independence. You probably should have arranged for a visit earlier in the summer though. At what point did you know she was going to get to on this team?", "YTA, I understand where you and your daughter are coming from but he does have a right, both morally and legally, to see his daughter. Is there no summer league in his town that she could play on? I doubt you know the answer as it does not appear from your post that you are the least bit interested in compromising. He pays child support and alimony and yet you are denying him the limited time he gets to see his daughter.", "NTA but communication now needs to go through YOUR lawyer.", "NTA with a hint of Y.T.A., but not really E.S.H.\n\nIt\u2019s fine that you want to listen to your daughter and he\u2019s TA for his emotional response. He is totally in the right to have things modified if you don\u2019t hold up your end.", "NTA, but you should let the lawyers handle this. Anything that has to do with a combative ex and child visitation must be handled through lawyers.\n\nI hate to point this out, but your ex is taking the correct steps in this very specific situation. He's wrong fundamentally, but he's leaving it to his lawyer, which you should have done from the start.", "NTA. But you should have had her talk to him. \nI get where he's coming from. But she's 16, this time when kids start having their own lives. \n\nI get he misses her. I don't know, maybe make her go. I mean, at the rate he's going, he only has a few years left before she cuts contact with him.

I don't see it happening.", "The mother would be found in contempt. Usually starts with allowing a correction, then a fine, then potential jail. The kid gets caught in the middle because the mother should be encouraging that relationship unless there\u2019s reason to question it.\n\nYes, the cops can show up to effectuate an exchange if it gets that far.", "Unfortunately they can take action against the mother as it is seen as her responsibility (I don't agree but it can happen). The parents need to get together and come to an amicable agreement on what is to happen, taking the daughter's feelings into consideration. Unfortunately if the dad already feels hard done by it might not be straight forward.", "I'm sure there are rare cases concerning an older teen where this can happen. And I'm not a lawyer so I'm not an expert by any means. But I have read that in most cases the law reads that the custodial parent much make every reasonable attempt at accommodating the court ordered visitation. And that if the older teen physically refuses to comply, and the parent can document this, then the custodial parent's obligation is considered satisfied. But again I'm not speaking from any actual expertise. \n\nAs for the cops showing up to effectuate the exchange, if the kid refuses physically to comply.....ie goes into passive resistance... I guess the cops can arrest the kid for refusing to follow a policeman's instructions and cart her off to jail. However that is sure as hell going to make the kid hate the non custodial parent (and cops as well). A Pyrrhic victory for dad and the legal system at that point. \n\nIn any case we are now way beyond the actual situation as described and into the realm of pure speculation. I hope the actual situation is resolved in the way that best suits the needs of the daughter.", "Again the parents are not my concern. If the mother--who seems a little too pleased with the father's displeasure at their daughter's wishes-- gets in trouble with the courts--well it would be unfortunate, but not the daughter's problem. The young woman has a right to do as she wishes in this situation and should not be deterred by legal fallout for her parents who are ultimately responsible for the situation. Of course all of this is hypothetical as we don't know what the daughter's wishes for contact with her dad--outside of the summer softball season--are. So I'm probably making a mountain out of a mole hill.", "Except you're forgetting that it may well affect the daughter if her actions have consequences for her parents in some way: guilt is a very powerful emotion, especially for a teenager.\n\nI agree that the mother should definitely be doing something more to try to ease the situation (offering alternative time for the daughter to go to the dad's, suggesting the daughter hand write a letter to her dad explaining her position) but to say that anything that happens to the mum will have zero affect on the daughter seems a little short sighted to me.", "INFO\n\nWho chose to live 6 hours from the other?", "This is beyond Reddit's pay grade. You need to speak with your lawyer and explain the situation that your daughter is in.", "INFO: why is he a 6 hour drive away? Did he move after the divorce or did you? If you\u2019re both good parents than it was in the kids best interests to have both parents present in their day to day lives. That way your daughter wouldn\u2019t have to choose between her social life and her relationship with either of her parents.", "Ok, father of 3 daughters. All played competitive travel softball, and I coached for over 20 years. It was great and we got to see a lot of great places. I had many players who were from divorced families. \n\nThat being said, YTA. Why, because of poor planning.  Yes, maybe the opportunity came up recently, but the first thing you should have done is look at the calander to see how it could be reworked to accommodate or at least have reasonable compromise on splitting time with your ex. Whether that he gets more time at the holidays, maybe at Christmas or Thanksgiving, or even spring break next year. You just went to the jugular with  she wants to play softball, and you're out of luck. Deal with it. \n\nAnother reason I think YTA is that I don't believe your story.  Competitive softball season is almost over. July is about the last month, and the major associations are having their World Series in the next couple of weeks. ASA  USSSA, , PGF, and NSA  are done the last weeks of July, latest first week of August.  So the rest of the season is 3 weeks....she can't go to her dad's for any of the 6 weeks. Why?  Seems like there would be 3 weeks she could go to see him. \n\nI'm sure your daughter is a good player that has aspirations to play college, and I hope she gets there, but being picked up for a partial season when you are 16 and not had previous travel ball experience(assuming this or you would have had this same situation the last 5 years) the chances are remote that a college sees her.", "NTA", "I think NTA (tho I think your concern for your alimony and child support might have influenced your calling him right away rather than leaving it to your lawyer).\n\nI say this because many courts will take into account a 16 yr old's wishes.  If you want to put off the court issue, try to come up with a compromise--the two weeks before softball stars and some time After it starts but before school year begins. How about the full Christmas holiday? and Spring break to compensate?  \n\nIt does sound as if all he cares about is his wishes, But I do have to remember I'm only hearing your side/interpretation.", "NTA.\n\nAll you did was relay your daughter's wishes. And she's right, this is a huge opportunity for her. It was your husband who went nuclear.\n\nTo all the ESH voters, please remember it was the daughter's request that OP handle the conversation because she was afraid of how her father would react. That's telling to me.\n\nNot only that, it looks like the father didn't give *any option* for a compromise. He just went ballistic and then involved the lawyers.", "Hope she updates us after Court hearing.", "In Texas, when you can not physically put them in the car anymore, a judge typically won't enforce visitation. \n\nMake her tell her dad she isn't coming. Document why. And if he takes you to court, he takes you to court.", "I believe sane people will side with your daughter. This is her education and professional future being launched! She has a gift! What if this was a male child and football scouts etc? It\u2019s the same thing. Does he not take her abilities seriously? It\u2019s a kind of abuse to deny your child an opportunity that could set them up for life.", "NTA but yes, get a custody mod. Alimony and CS should not be affected at all bc they are independent of parenting time. \n\nVery similar situation here; all my kids are now teenagers and the custody agreement was written when they were much younger so they would go to their dad\u2019s for a month in the summer. Now one plays sports at an elite level which involves work in the summertime and also simply doesn\u2019t want to spend a month two time zones away from his friends. \nThey\u2019re teenagers. They have autonomy. Forcing visitation is a great way to ruin a relationship, especially if it comes at the expense of something the child loves doing.", "INFO: why wasn't the softball schedule interfering with her visit to him discussed before now? \n\nShe had to tryout and that would have been a good time to start the conversation instead of blindsiding him a week before the visit.", "Yeah this is WAY above reddits pay grade in terms of the overall situation. \n\nI mean if you\u2019re talking morally about supporting your daughter? Then yeah that\u2019s great OP. But this situation obviously is WAY more in depth than that and you can\u2019t just arbitrarily decide to support your daughter and ignore legally ordered visitation on a whim (or your daughters whims).\n\nYour ex may be doing this out of genuine feelings that this isn\u2019t right, or simply cause of pettiness, but regardless, handling this legally is the only right option.\n\nAnd for those saying the daughter should be able to choose, that\u2019s true, if she wants to choose then that\u2019s fine, but the court documents need to be updated then, you can\u2019t say see she\u2019s mature enough to make a decision, and then cry that it\u2019ll traumatize her.", "For sure both the daughter and OP dropped the ball on communicating with the dad about the baseball schedule. Like you said, it\u2019s planned it out well in advance.\n\nThis whole situation could\u2019ve been prevented.", "OP moved for a \"job opportunity\" Dad attempted to get split or more time.", "this--she should have come up with some ideas for compromise instead of saying no go at all.", "excellent link--thanks for posting it(I like random information--never know when I'll need it for some reason).", "So, in that case I think you need to support a compromise or some way to make up some amount of the time. That said we also don\u2019t know why the divorce was necessary- which could further legitimize your need to take the job hours away. \n\nI also think that at 16, if this is her choice, she needs to own it and tell him herself.", "Wait, you moved away for a job. Were you putting the kids first when you removed them from the place they had grown up and from a constant relationship with their father? Were you putting their needs first when you moved a man into the home that you barely know? Were you putting their needs first in any of this?", "That\u2019s the thing - the *judge* ordered 2 months visitation in the summer. It\u2019s not dad\u2019s order that your 16 year old is flouting, it\u2019s the court\u2019s order. Kind of a dangerous thing, teaching a teenager that she can completely disregard a court order without consequence, yeah? You needed to come at this with a plan, not put both of you at way more legal risk than necessary", "That information isn't in the og post. And even still. In the event of a divorce, often big moves are of necessity more than anything whether for work, to have family support or home. \n\nIt also doesn't change the fact that if spending time with his kids was so important to him, he'd find other options. Especially given how important summer vacation is to kids and their friendships.", "Thank you for that. I stand corrected.", "Delusional", "You literally have zero context re alimony or the cause/need for the divorce so maybe relax lol\n\nThe kid is 16; hard to force visitation at that age", "Court order aside, in most jurisdictions, yes\u2014the 16 year old could easily be old enough to decide where to spend her time. There are several factors to consider. \nThe OP needs to modify the order to reflect her children growing up, but you are incorrect regarding the law.", "Not without the court\u2019s consent when both parents cannot agree. That\u2019s why there\u2019s even an order required. So I am not incorrect."]}
