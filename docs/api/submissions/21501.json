My fiance (35F) and I (37M) got engaged about 6-months ago and moved in together 3-months ago.  She was married before and has 2 kids who I adore (12 & 9).  She also has 2 step-kids from that marriage that her ex-husband had before they got married (21 & 17).  My fiance still keeps in touch with her step kids pretty regularly and is involved in their lives even though she's not with their father anymore.  I've never met the 21-year-old as he's away at college, but I've met the 17-year-old (Kate) 4-5 times.\n\nMy fiance has been pressuring me to build more of a relationship with Kate.  I honestly don't know why.  I'm not Kate's stepdad, I'm not an uncle, I'm not blood related in any way, I'm just the guy who is engaged to her former stepmom.  My fiance gets mad at me when I tell her I don't want to go to one of Kate's softball games, or meet up with her for lunch or dinner.  When my fiance wants to do something like that I will usually make an excuse or offer to watch my fiance's kids while she and Kate do whatever they want.\n\nI have never and will never tell my fiance she can't hang out with Kate or support her in whatever way she wants.  I just don't feel the need to involve myself in Kate's life in any meaningful way.  I love my fiance's 2 kids and I will be the best stepdad I can possibly be to them.  But I don't see Kate that same way.  I'm not going to be a stepdad to Kate the way I will be to the younger kids, Kate doesn't live with us.\n\nI am polite with Kate when we are around each other, but I'm not looking to build a meaningful relationship with her.  I've explained this to my fiance numerous times when she asks why I won't go to a softball game or something.  I think it's great that my fiance wants to maintain that kind of relationship with Kate, but I don't feel I need to be involved in that in any shape or form.\n\nLast night my fiance wanted to go to one of Kate's softball games, but neither of her kids wanted to go.  My fiance wanted it to be a family outing and us go out to eat after.  I offered to stay behind with the kids and meet my fiance for dinner after the game.  She got mad at me for \"always finding an excuse to not do something to support Kate.\"\n\nI told my fiance once again that I don't care about Kate.  I told her I think it's great that she wants to support her and stay involved in her life, but I don't have that previous relationship with Kate and I have no interest in building one.  I will gladly take care of the younger kids and absolutely love hanging out with them.\n\nI told her that Kate already has a support system and that I honestly think it's a little weird that my fiance is putting so much pressure on me to build a relationship with a 17-year-old girl who probably wants exactly zero to do with me.\n\nMy fiance ended up going to the game herself and later texted me to not worry about meeting her for dinner because she's taking Kate instead.", "created_utc": 1688656427, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14sc4ac/aita_for_not_having_a_relationship_with_my/", "score": 69, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Before you get married you need to sit down and have an in-depth talk on finances.  She is coming into the marriage with herself and two kids and Kate.  You are coming in solo.  I suggest you set a household budget that you both pay into according.  As she is obsessing with taking Kate out to eat, going to all of her events I can see her wanting to pay for part or all of her education at the expense of the rest of the family.", "INFO: how long was she and Katie\u2019s father together?\nIf she raised them, she could see them as her own children.", "NTA - She isn't your step-child and she has a support system. That your wife is making this her hill to die on seems a bit odd. However, I do think you are still being supportive  toward your wife because you don't have no problem with her still seeing and being supportive for Kate, and also you keep the other children when needed so that she can do that.\n\nHonestly, the next time she brought this up I would ask her has she ever even asked Kate did she want you in her life in the capacity that your wife is insisting on. I mean most kids her age don't even want to deal with a new step-dad that is actually their step-dad, much less a man that is nothing to her besides her ex step-mom's man.", "NAH. I get where your fianc\u00e9e is coming from, having raised Kate for over half of Kate\u2019s life. I also get where you\u2019re coming from.", "NTA. Her ex step child is more important to her than you? \n\nYou are going to be husband 3? Why?", "But of course, it's her kid.\n\nShe's been in Kate's life for at least 13 years (12 yo kid and probably a relationship pre-pregnancy). Or longer. OP does not state how long her previous relationship was or if Kate's biological mom is involved. For all we know, OP's fiancee might be Kate's only mom. I'd hope not, but we don't know. \n\nIn any case she considers herself Kate's parent and if Kate is still inviting her to her games, I'd say the feeling is mutual. Why wouldn't you want your partner to have *some* sort of a relationship with your kid. If she wants to invite Kate to family things at their place, it'd be nice if OP and Kate weren't total strangers to each other. Even being acquaintances seems like a step up from the current situation.", "My fiance sees Kate as her kid too.  Even though she's not her bio-mom, she helped raise her for over a decade.  But Kate's a teenage girl who will be going off to college in a year.  Kate doesn't come to our house to visit her half-siblings.  Kate has her own life, her own life, and her own existing support system.  I honestly don't even know if my fiance has asked Kate if she wants any kind of relationship with me.  I'm not going to be Kate's stepdad the way I will for the younger kids.  Kate will never live with us, she's not going to be spending Xmas morning with us, etc.  \n\nI understand this might be important to my fiance, but I honestly feel like she's the ONLY one who this is important too.  I honestly wouldn't be surprised if Kate feels the exact same way about this as I do.", "The ex is a decent guy, I have no problems with him.  He has split custody of my fiance's 2 kids with him and he's a good dad to them.  I haven't seen him around Kate much, but I can only assume he's as gentle and caring with her as he is with my future stepkids.  My fiance was married to her ex for 11-years.", "He said 10 years.", "It's interesting that your fiancee doesn't seem to be pushing for Kate and her half siblings to have more of a relationship, but is insisting that you do.  She seemed to have no problem when the kids refused to attend Kate's soft ball game, but she was annoyed at you for not wanting to attend.   NTA.", "You pointed out exactly where the problem is there.  It doesn't need to be important to Kate, it's important to your *fiance*.\n\nNah\n\nYou are right, in that you and Kate will in most likelihood never have a relationship, and that she doesn't need your support, and might not even care if you are there or not. \n\nBut...\n\nIt's not Kate you support by going to those things, it's your fiance. Showing that, even if you don't take interest in her interests, you do care about *her*.", "Could she be getting cold feet and looking for an excuse to make you the bad guy? I don't understand her frustrations with this, its very bizarre", "So then she has been in her step child\u2019s life from the age of 5 years and possibly even younger\u2026.she watched her grow up and considers herself at least partly her mom. I personally, would also want my partner to be connected to someone I love like a child, someone I planned to be around with me and my kids for a long time. But no one can force you to feel a certain way. Sounds like you guys need to talk.", ">I personally, would also want my partner to be connected to someone I love like a child\n\nOk, but Kate's not exactly a child anymore.  She' a young woman who will be going off to college in a year.  I honestly don't even know if my fiance has asked Kate if she wants me in her life in any way.  I have to imagine Kate feels pretty much the same way about this as I do.", "You do realize that people still talk to their kids once they\u2019re in college, right?", "I think OP's point is that, since Kate is almost a grown woman, he can't build a connection with her the way OP's fianc\u00e9 did when Kate was 5.", "The way OP is talking about it sounds like they\u2019re saying \u201cKate is almost an adult, at which point my partner will no longer have anything to do with them ever again so why bother?\u201d", "Ah, I see what you're saying. That would definitely be a bad way for OP to look at it.", "Not really sure if this is an A-H situation so much as it seems like poor communication.\n\nI think the issue is that despite not being blood-related to Kate, OP\u2019s fianc\u00e9e clearly sees and treats Kate like her own daughter and therefore wants to keep Kate in her life and wants her partner to get along with her. Even if OP\u2019s fianc\u00e9e is not Kate\u2019s birth mother, from her perspective I could see how OP is basically rejecting the girl she helped raise for 12-13 years (guessing based off ages). \n\nI think OP is correct about there not *technically* being any obligation to build a relationship, but the point is that it\u2019s not for Kate\u2019s benefit, it\u2019s for his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s. NAH because everyone\u2019s feelings are valid, but that being said, I\u2019m wondering if making a pointed effort to stay out of Kate\u2019s life is really worth the potential relationship damage here. Might be weird to view a familial relationship as cost/benefit but if it\u2019s that important to OP\u2019s fianc\u00e9e then a little effort could go a long way.", "NTA - but don't rush into marriage, because this is really weird.", "Yta-  I know you don\u2019t mean to be but  you need to realize that Kate is 17 years old which means that  Your wife has been a part of her life since she was a toddler.\n\nYour wife sees Kate as one of her children .\n\nyou rejecting a relationship with her child is hurtful to her just as it would be if you rejected the younger step kids.\n\nYa know ? \n\nYes, you\u2019re not gonna be her step dad or have any hand in raising her but I hope you realize that your wife will always be there for Kate and she wants you to care about her just as much as she does .", "Maybe quit this thing while you\u2019re still ahead buddy", "NTA but I\u2019d think carefully about what kind of support you are really OK with your fianc\u00e9 giving Kate. Specifically, is your fianc\u00e9 planning to contribute financially to Kate\u2019s college tuition?", "NTA\n\nFamily comes in all shapes sizes and configurations and family isnt just \"blood relatives\".  Family is people you love and who love you back and it is great for her that she loves and values Kate.  It is a bit odd that she keeps wanting you to be involved in kate's life unless kate's family is absent for some reason.\n\nBut it is also a bit odd that want zero to do with Kate.  Would you feel this way if kate was a really good friend of your fiance instead of a former step daughter?  I ask because most people try to develop relationships with their partner's friends and family, if for no other reason, because  they are important to their partners.\nAnd to continually blow off events with Kate leaves one with the perception that you have no interest in supporting your partner's interests.  Which also seems very odd.", "Yeah, I'd give some serious thought to whether or not you should marry this person.  This will only escalate.   \n\n\nNTA.", "NTA. Your wife is being a weirdo OP.", "Is Kate's mom still in the picture?  If not then your fiancee may feel like she's the only mom Kate has, and she loves Kate, she loves you, and she wants you two to get along.  She's trying to be inclusive by having the people she loves at least meet up with and be comfortable with each other.\n\nObviously by now you won't be a father figure to Kate, but would it be so bad to act as a cool uncle or older brother to a young woman your fiancee loves?", "There\u2019s no right or wrong here.  Your fianc\u00e9 has a genuine relationship with her ex-stepdaughter.  That\u2019s great.  \n\nHow about this?  Treat this girl like a friend.  As your fianc\u00e9s friend, be nice to her.  You do t have to be too involved, but including her sometimes is the nice thing to do.  \n\nThis reflects well on the nice person your fianc\u00e9 is.", "NAH.", "I'm going to say NAH. To you Kate might seem all these steps removed, but to your fiance Kate is as good as her kid. Of course she wants you to be involved.", "We have no clue how long she has been a part of Kate's life. My stepson is almost 17, I have been in his life for about 16 of those years. If his father and I were to divorce and my kid still wanted the relationship with me, I would be grateful and do what I needed to foster that. He may have a bio mom, but he also has me. Always has, always will. \n\nI lean more NAH. This is also the sister of her 2 kids with her ex.", "I think we found the fiance", "There's one thing that I can say you did wrong. And only if the kids were present when you volunteered to watch them so they didn't have to go. If she wants to take her kids to that game you shouldn't interfere with that. If she wants to have a family outing you shouldn't be offering another option to the kids.\n\nIf you in private offered to do that without the kids knowledge then you did the correct thing. But as far as the kids go you can't be interfering with her choices, especially not in front of them.\n\nThe United front is incredibly important in parenting. Discuss in private.", "Is she asking you to have the same relationship with Kate that she has? Or could she be trying to make it so everyone is comfortable around each other? Have you asked her if she has talked to Kate?", "This is exactly how I have read it and any of OP's comments.", "No he is being very pragmatic about the reality of a kid about to go off to College for a few years and coming home for the holidays, likely to her Dad's place and then after that maybe never coming home. I don't see what relationship OP is meant to have with this kid beyond step moms partner that they see maybe at graduation and siblings birthdays."]}
