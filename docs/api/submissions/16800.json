Your experiences with bullying and negative body image are traumatic and have had a significant impact on your mental health. It's important for your well-being that you establish boundaries with your mother regarding comments about your appearance.  \nYour mother's intentions may be well-meaning, but the impact of her comments is harmful to you. It's understandable that you want to focus on building a life where your looks are not the biggest deal and where you can work towards body neutrality. Your mother may not fully understand the extent of the harm caused by her comments, but it's important for you to communicate your needs to her.  \nIt's also important to acknowledge that your mother's comments may be a result of societal beauty standards and pressures, and not necessarily a reflection of her love for you. However, it's still important for her to respect your boundaries and not contribute to your negative body image.  \nIt's understandable that you may feel bad for upsetting your mother, but it's important to prioritize your own mental health and well-being. You have the right to establish boundaries and communicate your needs, even if it causes discomfort or upset for others.", "NTA.\n\nYou are setting healthy boundaries about the comments you wish and don\u2019t wish people to make about you. She is an asshole for not respecting them.\n\nThere are a million other comments one could make that are positive and not related to what is clearly a trigger for you. I think that you can help her understand though!\n\nI also have a mum who meant well with her comments, but didn\u2019t get it. My mum equates comments and noticing with care. So I knew it was important for her to find some way to make comments. There are lots of infographics on Instagram that are non-physical compliments and ways to show your concern. I find those really nice. I\u2019ve shared heaps with her over the last few years, and realising that I don\u2019t care about how I look, I care about how I feel, how I make others feel, my energy and how I show up. Her compliments have changed from being about my physical appearance to other traits.\n\nI hope you and your mum get there too.", "NTA.   \nIf she legitimately \"can't say anything to you\" without commenting on your appearance, then she should reflect on her inability to connect or converse with her child in a genuine and meaningful capacity while keeping her commentary to herself.", "You are NTA. Your mother undermined your confidence from an early age and continues to be overly involved in your appearance. Congrats on working to set boundaries with her.

If she doesn\u2019t want you to leave her alone, she needs to leave you alone about this. \n\nHere\u2019s how I know. I have been told that my parents\u2019 love for me was unconditional. Ha. I was monitored and rewound. When my father died, and I flew home from college in the darkest dress I could find to show respect, all I wanted was to get home and hug my mother. She greeted me at the front dog, hugged me, held me off and sadly shook her head because either the dress didn\u2019t fit right or I had gained weight, which was unacceptable.\n\nYears later, when I told her about it, she had forgotten it/it wasn\u2019t true.

The problem lies with the people around you.  And mom is now crying bc you stood up to her.  Well, boo hoo mom.  Sometimes the truth hurts.  NTA.  I had a mom like that.

I have the cognitive and emotional maturity of a 25-year-old woman but the sense of self, body confidence, identity, awareness of my strenghts and self-trust of a 15-year-old child (= almost entirely absent).

I first went to study in another city and then moved to another country to be with my partner and work. I only visit for holidays and birthdays. I have found my happiness, albeit partial, elsewhere. \n\nShe was very ambiguous during my teenage years, she said she could understand the pain I was feeling but then pulled some BS like \"don't be so dramatic, it can't be that bad, they tease you because they like you (ALL of them liked me? And that was their way to show it? Jesus). Sometimes she talked to me about what was troubling me but then she dismissed everything because she probably didn't know what to do to help me, and she on top of that she proceeded to bully me herself. She apologized for being \"too harsh\" but she insists it \"just happened once or twice\" and I should understand because she was very stressed about other issues. I can assure you it was not just a couple of times, it was years. All in all she thinks she hasn't done anything wrong.", "Good for you for prioritizing your needs! I wish you much success with your therapy.", "Your mother has shown no remorse. She bullied you and enabled others to bully you relentlessly. The crocodile tears are a guilt trip. You're not stuck in the past, you're still recovering from it. Parents are supposed to protect their children from harm.

Good for you because you deserve to be confident.\n\nEfit to add: NTA, but your mom is a MASSIVE AH", "NTA. Mother, if your sentence contains the word look. Don't fucking say it. Trauma doesn't go away because it happened awhile ago. Either that or tell her she looks tired where she says something about you. Pretty sure everyone hates that.", "NTA, she started crying??? She's feeling guilty for contributing to everything. I hope you have a good therapist. <3", "NTA but you need therapy.", "This is a good comment, because OP\u2019s mom said something interesting: \u201cI feel like I can\u2019t say anything anymore.\u201d\n\nOP, you mother doesn\u2019t know how to relate to you in a non-appearance-based way. She doesn\u2019t know what to say if she isn\u2019t commenting on your looks. She realizes she berated you too much, and thinks she fixed it by saying good things instead of bad things. But you\u2019re trying to get to a place where you don\u2019t care how each other look, and you talk about other, more interesting, stuff. It would be worth it to try talking to her again and say that you understand that if she can\u2019t talk about looks, she doesn\u2019t know what to say. Offer to come up with a few topics that are better to talk about:\n\n[work]\u2014how\u2019s work?\n\n[current events]\u2014did you see the coronation? What a hullabaloo, am I right?\n\n[community]\u2014did you end up going to that cheese shop I wanted to try?\n\n[arts]\u2014the symphony is doing St Matthew\u2019s Passion next year\u2026 should we finally join the chorus?\n\nOr whatever. The important thing is that from now on, you are not making efforts to look any particular way. She can\u2019t comment on you looking any particular way. She is just going to have to get more creative.\n\nAnd it is her stuck in the past. Here is the present, we are all trying to find ways to connect with each other at work, at school, socially, that have nothing to do with looks. I teach little kids and we have spent a lot time training teachers not to tell little girls: \u201cwhat a pretty dress!\u201d And to instead say something like, \u201cDo you like drawing or singing better for today, because you get to pick!\u201d", ">Trauma doesn't go away because it happened awhile ago.\n\nShe once told me \"I understand that you might have suffered ('might have'... I loved the subtle invalidation), but these things are far behind you. People think you're pretty now, so what's the problem? Your life is hard because YOU refuse to let go of it and YOU keep dragging this negative emotional baggage around and onto the next stages of your life. If you wanna heal YOU have to stop being so negative to yourself, and if you don't wanna do it, well, then it means you enjoy the status quo because it is convenient to blame everything that doesn't work out in your life on your mental world where everybody hates you and you are scared of everything\". \n\nActual words. \n\nNow imagine how it would look like if the same logic was presented to survivors of other kinds of abuse much worse than bullying.", "OP NTA. Nope you are right. Set your boundaries. If she has nothing else to discuss than your body or face it's on her. You are 100% right. Because commenting on the positives also leaves the door open for the negatives. \"But I was trying to make you feel better\". By telling me how I wasn't looking ideally before, or what will happen if I break my leg and I can't swim for 3 months. NO", "NTA. Asking someone to please not comment on your appearance is a very simple and reasonable boundary. Respecting that boundary is showing respect for you. Prioritizing her ability to editorialize your appearance over your comfort is a crappy thing for your mother to do. She might be crying about it, but that is neither your fault nor your responsibility. You are not stuck in the past. She just likes the sense of power that comes with thinking that her opinion of your appearance is going to affect what you do - \"I only say it to make you work on yourself.\" She's not trying to truly compliment you & make you feel good. She's trying to control you.\n\n\nPerhaps you could visit r/raisedbynarcissists or r/emotionalneglect and see if any of the stories feel familiar to you. You are not alone in being treated this way, and you don't have to be alone in healing from that treatment.\n\n\nWishing you all the best :)", "NTA", "I know that giving her a taste of her own medicine would be an amazing way to put an end to this BS, and I can't tell you how many times I have been tempted to do it, but I have always found it too hard to go from being the victim to being the perpetrator. In the worst times I promised myself I would never ever hurt somebody else the way I was hurt and this sticks to me. This was certainly part of the problem; if I had the courage to stand up to my bullies and say \"excuse me, you're one to talk? Have you ever looked in a mirror before?\" I would have spared myself a lot of suffering, but for some reason my heart told me it was better to be a pushover than an offender. Still as of today I would be completely incapable to make a single comment on my mom's appearance, not even to prove my point, but I wish I could follow your golden advice and dump some pebbles from my shoes \ud83d\ude02"]}
