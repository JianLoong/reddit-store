They insisted on you coming so you would be a free babysitter. Expect to have your little sister foisted on you the entire trip with your dad using him paying as an excuse if you fight against it.", "Hmmmm . . . I'm going to go with NTA.\n\nI really despise these stories where parents assume they can dump their kids on their older siblings or some other relatives at a moment's notice. And this subreddit is full of stories like this.\n\nI thought about going with E-S-H, because you're doing an underhanded move because you assumed that they were joking with you. But I think your dad is by far the worse AH in this situation. It is not your job to keep a five-year-old entertained. Your dad made this five-year-old; it's his job to attend to her needs. While I don't expect him to never need a break, hire babysitters, etc., anyone assigned to care for this child must be consenting.\n\nAnd I especially don't like the part where he's basically exiled you to the back of the plane with your five-year-old sister, so he doesn't have to deal with her. While he sits in front of the plane several rows away.\n\nAnd for future reference, you have to find better ways of backing out of trips that you don't wish to go on. \"Oh, I'm so sorry. We're so busy at work, I can't get the time off.\"", "ESH\n\nYou should not be responsible for your little sister on such a long flight, the parents should. Furthermore, dad was doubly an asshole by joking about this arrangement and not directly discussing it with you before sneaking it into the itinerary. \n\nHowever, you know damn well that this issue is likely going to come back as a bigger problem judging by how you dumped the lie onto your middle sister. Either your dad is going to deduce what you had done and confront you about it, or he will simply try and change the seats back to how they were before. You\u2019re just pulling the same stunt that he did at this point. Get ahead of it and have this discussion with your dad before he finds out the hard way, or else you\u2019re just digging this hole deeper and dragging your middle sister into it too. This shouldn\u2019t be up to you, but it is now like it or not, so fix this before it gets any worse.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
