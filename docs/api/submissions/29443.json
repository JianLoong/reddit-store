She needed a laptop, she bought a laptop. Yes, MacBooks are more expensive and it may not be as well suited for her specific work needs, but it may be what her coworkers use and could be easier for in-office stuff. She definitely should have spoken to you about it since it used joint funds, but I'd let this one go if I were you. Not worth fighting about.\n\nOne suggestion though: one of the best decisions my wife and I made when we got married was to have separate personal accounts in addition to our joint accounts. We've got joint checking and savings and also our own personal checking and savings, so we have designated household funds that we make sure we're on the same page about and designated personal funds that we don't need to run by each other.", "Info can you all afford the MacBook or is this going to hurt your budget?", "Info: What are you actually asking us to judge you on? That you're upset she made a high spend without discussion, or that you're upset she wanted a higher priced laptop?", "NAH\n\nYou folks need an agreement about how much money you\u2019re allowed to spend on personal stuff without consulting the other. Or you need separate personal accounts that you can use for things like this. (My husband and I have separate personal accounts, into which we automatically deposit the same amount each month.) \n\nHowever, your discussion of whether a MacBook is actually the right computer for her is sort of gross, because you are second-guessing her analysis of her own needs. I\u2019m an IT professional, and I use Macs exclusively for my personal computers. The integration between a Mac and an iPhone is a significant time-saver, and MS Office runs fine on the Mac.", "If she\u2019s anything like me, she\u2019s a Mac person and that\u2019s it. It\u2019s not on purpose, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s superior, it\u2019s just what Im used to and also the industry standard in my career. \n\nLaptops, phones, pens, cars, pants, all very personal items that a person should be allowed to choose themselves. \n\nHowever - you have a joint account and usually discuss financial matters so for not discussing first she\u2019s gently the asshole.", "NAH. Think of it as an investment. I still have my 2008 MacBook Pro and it has seen better days but is still functional. However, my work laptop, a Dell just bit the dust after two years of use. \n\nMacs, in my experience, have more long term value. Think of it as buying one nice winter coat that will last a decade versus fast fashion. \n\nAlso, if it\u2019s for work, maybe it\u2019s a write off?", "INFO\n\nSounds like what you\u2019re mostly mad about is a big purchase without a conversation but it\u2019s only apparent after going through your comments. You\u2019re fixating on her buying a MacBook and go on about how she could have bought something cheaper which isn\u2019t really the issue.\n\nSo, on to the issue! Since you have a joint account, do you also have an agreement about the budget you can spend freely vs. what needs to be discussed? Answering this question will really tell you if you\u2019re TA or not.", "Just boggles my mind how people think joint accounts are a good idea.", "YTA -- It's not up to you to decide what she needs to effectively do her work. She probably didn't mention it because she doesn't see it as a luxury expense, she sees it as a utility. In fact, you guys can probably write off a portion of it on your taxes, so it won't be as huge of a burden as you're imagining.\n\nNow onto the type of computer she got: I don't love Macs, but it is incredibly condescending to assume it's only for the brand. The ecosystem syncing is a high game changer when trading and sending files with colleagues. Also, some people just mesh better with the apple operating system.\n\nSure, she could have gotten a MacBook Air for the work that she does, but you don't want to get a computer powerful enough for your work. You want a computer powerful enough to not have to worry about 5 years from now. My partner has been using the same MacBook pro since 2017, and is only now considering a refresh.\n\nIt's absolutely fine for your feelings to be hurt that she didn't mention buying one to you, mine would be hurt. But all you can do is say that it hurt your feelings and move on. Not act like her work computer is a big family decision on what she does or does not need.", "This is a hard one. I don\u2019t think either of you are TA really. You disagree with her choice of laptop, but maybe she prefers using an Apple computer over a windows one, even if she is going to be running office on it. On the flip side, she should have discussed it first if you\u2019re sharing income.  \n\nMay I suggest you guys talk about it and maybe start up separate bank accounts where you can both just put a little bit aside for yourselves for this type of thing?", "Husband uses ipone, macbook etc while I use Samsung, IBM etc. It's a preference and if you prefer Apple, it's a bit difficult to switch. I understand where you're coming from but if it doesn't really impact you guys financially, maybe explain to her that a heads up before making purchases above a threshold would be nice moving forward. NAH.", "A gentle YTA\n\nEffectively you are coming here to complain about your wife's judgement. She works, makes money, and evaluated what \\*she\\* needs to be productive, and you're so upset about it you're doing a reddit post, and also being dismissive about the reasons she's given you.\n\nSince it seems like there's not a lot of understanding about why a mac is an effective tool, and you're coming to reddit about it instead of asking your wife, here's a breakdown of just a few of the things that she could find effective for a work situation.\n\nWhile many of these things \\*can\\* be done on a PC, or with Android, they are often more involved and take 3rd party programs with varying levels of complexity, some have subscriptions, and they can break or fail. They also don't work with iPhone, so you'd be forcing your wife to switch to Android.\n\nI have used both Windows and Mac for years, and also spent years on Android, so this isn't a \"Mac vs. Windows\" post, it's just explaining some of the things macs can do since you're asking here on reddit, instead of trusting your wife's judgement that she is more productive in this environment.\n\n* Messages\n   * messages are integrated into the operating system with an auto-sync program between computer and phone\n   * On computer, it's easy to paste/drag things into the messages app for easy communication to individual or group text messages for work review:\n      * photos\n      * links\n      * text clips from work documents for review\n   * Easy to get quick approvals from clients / coworkers via text\n* Calendar\n   * same calendar sync between computer and phone\n   * alarms / reminders show up on both devices when away from desk.\n* Todo List\n   * integrated todo list system that syncs between phone and computer.\n   * easy to set reminders and alerts that show everywhere.\n* Document Scanning\n   * You can scan a document using your phone, directly to your computer for email, or storage.\n* Contacts\n   * iPhone and Mac share an integrated contact list\n   * Easy to email / message / call from both phone & computer\n   * Easy to capture contacts while away from computer that can be used on computer.\n* Hot Spot\n   * Phone automatically set up as internet provider to mac if away from wifi.\n   * Can be easily chosen from drop-down menu at top.\n* Sketches / Markup\n   * Phone can be used to make sketches that can be used in email, or mark up mac documents.\n   * Changes can be seen live on mac.\n* Integrated Drivers, No 3rd party\n   * Apple hardware is all \"direct\" so there are no 3rd party drivers to maintain, or worry about compatibility, or upgrading at different times.\n   * Makes it easy to maintain, especially for people who don't have windows experience.\n* Cross device copy/paste\n   * you can copy & paste between phone and computer\n\nThere's a lot of other little things like photo integration, but I'm going to focus here just on the things that apply more to a work environment.\n\nThere's a lot of things that going into a computer's value, like how many times you have to pay support, or what the resale value would be, where Macs do appear to win in studies.  For example, use cases like IBM, which has deployed nearly 200,000 Macs, reported that their IT support help desk receives twice as many support calls for PCs as for Macs. Moreover, only 5% of support tickets opened for Mac users require an in-person visit versus 27% for PC users.\n\nMacs also hold their value better over time, so in a few years your wife could resell her mac to upgrade, drastically reducing the costs going forward.\n\nAs mentioned, I've used both Mac and PC for years, and when I was using a PC with Android, many of these things are things you \\*could\\* do, but required 3rd party apps. Finally with windows 11 they've added some of these features for use with Android, but not with iPhone and it would be very hard for your wife to figure out how to get even part of this working if she's not technical, or simply wants to focus on \\*using\\* the features instead of trying to figure out how to make them work.\n\nYour wife probably knows a lot of this stuff. Talk to her. If this is how you dismiss her judgement, is it really any surprise that she went off and purchased it without wanting to get talked out of something she needs?\n\nNow next time... Work on the communication between you two instead of coming to reddit to try and get ammunition for why you don't want to listen to YOUR wife telling you what she needs to be productive.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYTA.", "I\u2019m going to go on the other side with NTA, NAH. You need to communicate. My wife and I have a big purchase threshold that requires a conversation. When we were younger and didn\u2019t make much it was $100. Now that we are older and in a much better position we have raised the number but kept the conversation. Not because of control, but because it\u2019s one of the many ways we respect each other. \n\nLaptop is done and focusing on it will only cause resentment. Have the real conversation and move forward.", "I think there\u2019s a misconception that MacBooks are just overpriced and not worth it. I had years of other laptop brands and they were always clunky and would inevitably overheat. I was jealous of how sleek and light Mac laptops were in university when I saw other people using them. \n\nI got a Mac in 2016 and I\u2019m still using it. I\u2019m glad I invested. It\u2019s so light to carry, it\u2019s efficient and only in the last few months has noticeably overheated or had iffy battery but it\u2019s also about six years old. \n\nI have AirPods and an iPhone now, I love the convenience and longevity of the products. Apple care is also really helpful, I\u2019ve been able to make an appointment and go into their stores for any tech related issues.", "Talk to your wife and express your concern over the lack of communication NAH", "The main issue I see here is making a big purchase out of your joint account without a discussion. \n\nI may be a Mac fan boy but my company is switching over to macs despite the fact that we run all Microsoft apps. We have had to replace well spec\u2019ed PCs constantly and people have had constant issues with them. A few of us ran Mac\u2019s and my boss decided to try one out for himself. After a few months he said he didn\u2019t want to deploy any more PCs with how much better his experience was. \n\nThe only real issues we run into are Microsoft based issues that are not related to the OS. \n\nA Mac may be more upfront but honestly I think you at least break even long term if not come out a head. In the last 20 years I have had 4 Mac laptops )and my most recent one is only 2 years old. So on average I got 6 years per machine but the longevity has been growing over time. My first one was replaced by Apple after almost 3 years because they couldn\u2019t replace the component as it was one of the last G4 laptops snd had been sunset, second one lasted about 6 years before it was just slowing down too much for me, 3rd lasted 9 years (was no longer supported on the newest OS and I held out a bit for the new silicone Macs), and my current one is 2 years old and still more powerful than most laptops on the market. \n\nBut yeah, fan boy rant over. NTA for having a concern about her spending that much money with no conversation. Her choice of machine is probably a logical one though.", "NAH but I will say that the MacBook will last twice if not three times as long as any other laptop. My husband has gone through three Dells in the time I\u2019ve had my laptop and he gets on it maybe twice a week while I use mine every day. So yeah it costs more upfront, but it is FAR superior in longevity.", "NAH (assuming the discussion was respectful) but I wanted to add that I buy MacBooks because I generally get around eight years out of them. Just replaced my 2015 model this summer (actually still works it\u2019s just slow) and the 2015 replaced my 2007 model. \n\nI haven\u2019t had that kind of luck with PCs.\n\nEdit: spelling", "NTA but I got a MacBook Pro in 2016 and it runs like a frigging champ still.

I have a strong preference for a MacBook pro. I'll add the last company I worked for allowed us to choose. I chose Mac.

I\u2019ve found that MacBooks aren\u2019t great at linking with important Microsoft programs and often have issues with making presentations that everyone can see due to MacBook.

I do agree with you that PCs are better for business (software compatibility, multi-window / screen management), but Macs do have some pretty sweet capabilities that PCs don\u2019t have (integrating with your iPhone is just the tip of the iceberg; Macs also come preloaded with a bunch of great photo, video, and music production software).  Because of the nature of my work, I personally would not switch my PC work laptop to a Mac, but I am seriously considering a Mac for home use.", "I\u2019m just wondering why, if it\u2019s REALLY for work, why isn\u2019t work selecting, paying for, and setting up said laptop?", "Doesn't she get a 50% bite of your personal account in case of a divorce?", "Yep... we went from separate + joint account to only a joint account.

My husband and I use joint accounts but we have funds in the budget set aside for each of us to spend as we like and other funds for technology needs, car repairs, etc. We would talk about it before spending money from a joint fund, but we can spend our fun money into the ground without checking.

Gently the AH for not discussing with her husband because of the Joint accounts. But yea Macs are not that much more than windows nowadays especially if she needs one with higher specs. If you just use your laptop for browsing, and some office docs here and there than a simple 500- 800 laptop from Walmart will do, but if you need it for work to run specific softwares you may need upgraded specs that can also run you a pretty penny. I used window laptops most of my life growing up especially through school and they didn\u2019t last more than 1 year or 2. I finally switched to MacBook after my last 2 purchases. While I was searching, in order to get the laptop with the specs i needed windows in comparison to MacBooks pricing wasn\u2019t that much of a difference. But based on my history with windows, i knew after a couple of years i would need a new one so i decided to try MacBook instead. This was years ago. I just upgraded recently but my old MacBook which is now 8 years old still works I use my upgraded one for work & to run the big softwares and my old one to browse the internet and watch youtube and such. I\u2019m not saying MacBook is Better than windows, this was just my personal experience having now used both systems. Which is why I chose to stay with MacBook. It may seem a higher price but in my experience it was worth the investment compared to having to buy a new windows computer every 2 years. \n\nAnyways I kind of just wanted to offer a different perspective to OP so he doesn\u2019t see it as such a huge waste of money. Again it all depends on what you need, especially if is for work, you\u2019re going to need certain specs to handle professional software and storage that a simple $500 Acer from Walmart will not have. At the end of the day if I add up all the $$ i spent purchasing new Windows every other year, I spent more than what I spent on my one MacBook over time. That\u2019s another way I looked at it. Sorry i\u2019m an accountant so I do a lot of math before I purchase anything \ud83d\ude02 \n\nHe may not understand the reasoning why she needed this specific laptop but that doesn\u2019t mean it was a waste of money. Is more of an investment in a higher quality item that may last longer than your cheaper item and Windows, as I mentioned earlier, is not that much cheaper now a days.

She *did* run by you that she wanted to buy a laptop. I think YWBTA if you talked to her about it in the tone/attitude of mild outrage you're using here - because it's not clear she violated any agreement as she believed the agreement was set out.\n\nWas it that you thought \"Windows laptop for professional use, like , $800-1200\" and she came home with a $1500 MacBook? Or a $2500 one? How big is the discrepancy in $$ and is the money now missing for another low-down priority? And are you sure that your reaction would have been the same if she had bought an all bells and whistles Windows laptop for the same price?\n\nOnce you're clear in your head, I think you should approach your wife, calmly and without reproach, and tell her that the MacBook buying episode has given you a pause about how you two are handling large expenses. That it's not her fault - she *said* she was buying a laptop! - but that your expectation was in the $X range and her MacBook is in the $Y range. They to work with her to find a mode of working together to avoid surprises in the future \n\nThere are basically two ways of doing it: Run bigger expenses by each other not just in kind but in dollar amount. \"I'm going to buy a Lenovo ThinkPad X1 from Costco for $1800. Plus a carry case for $X.\" (Very nice up to date Windows laptop.) Or assign each other a monthly amount that each of you can spend with no oversight of the other, in which case if she wants a slightly more expensive laptop it can come from spending a little less on clothes, pedicures or going out with friends for a while. \n\nThe downside of the first method is that you might start micromanaging each other. (And frankly you sound like you're inclined that way.) The downside of the second is that each of the personal allocation needs to be fair, as in, if one of you has higher needs in clothing or workday lunches or ir computers then the personal allocation needs to reflect that. But then each of you can have a mountain bike or fancy laptop or weekend trip if you've enough in you personal \"just for me\" account.", "It kind of sounds like there are a few connected issues here, which you should think about, and talk through with her.\n\nYou say you mostly object to the high spend without discussion.  But it also sounds like you two did not have a specific conversation about, \"either of us can spend up to $X without discussion, but for big-ticket purchases - defined as x, y, z, or above $X amount - we should discuss it\".  So now, you're taken aback by her making a purchase that YOU feel is \"big\", but that you hadn't beforehand defined as \"big\"?  So you're upset because she went over a line, but she couldn't see the line was there?\n\nThe lesson there is -- you guys need to set those spending rules so both of you are aware of where the line is.  Or, as many others are suggesting, rearrange your finances so that you have a joint account for household expenses, but separate personal accounts that you can spend on exactly what you want, without the other person getting hurt.\n\nThe other issue, though, is -- so, why didn't she talk to you about it?  Or, did she feel that she couldn't talk to you about it?\n\nThe way you wrote the post, you went into a lot of detail about why you felt like she \"didn't need\" this particular thing, and you do get kind of accusatory about it -- implying she only wants it for the brand, not for what YOU think are the \"right reasons\", and also expressing that you don't really believe what she says are factors that went into her decision.\n\nSo you need to ask yourself whether she made this purchase without asking you, because she was trying to avoid a situation where you wouldn't agree to the purchase until she was doing what YOU want.  And you can say, \"that's compromise\", but it's really not.  The way you talked about it in your post doesn't feel like you would have given her that fair a hearing about it -- or, like you feel that she didn't have good enough reasons and couldn't have made a \"rational\" case for why she wanted this particular thing.\n\nWhether that's fair or not, or whether that's a pattern with purchases, or confined to electronics (about which you think you have better judgement than she does?), is at least something to examine.  Do you respect her opinions on purchases? Do you respect when she WANTS something, even if it's not what you want and therefore you don't see the same value in it?  You said in another comment that there are things you think are more important that the money could have been spent on... does she know what those things are?  Does SHE agree with what you think is important?\n\nI can't imagine buying something like a new computer, or new car, or any \"big\" thing really, without automatically wanting to talk about it with a partner.  Not just because my partner gets a say in how the money is spent, but because I value the partner's thoughts while trusting that they trust \\*me\\* to make a decision.\n\nIf I were reluctant to talk over a big purchase with someone, it would probably be in fear of judgement from them, or because I've had experience with them acting like their judgement is always better and they won't agree with what I want; that they'll talk down to me.\n\nYou, of course, know better than we do whether this might be the case in your relationship.  Or, you may want to think of talking it over with her and genuinely asking whether you are sometimes overbearing in the way you take over discussions about how to use joint finances.  \n\nOR, is this more a matter that this is a pattern with HER that you are frustrated with, where she NEVER asks you or talks to you about household spending goals?  So that you feel you've been left with the responsibility by yourself, and that always makes you the \"bad guy\" in talks like this?  Because that wouldn't be good either.\n\nUnless she has ignored a rule that the two of you clearly agreed to beforehand about big purchases, she's not really an asshole for not talking to you about it.
