She did not have a job nor had ever had one previously to moving in with us.  We require her to pay $400 in rent plus contribute $50 per week in groceries, totaling $600 per month.  We also set her up in YNAB (budgeting software) to help her save money and get her finances in order.  The agreement upon moving in was that she would be able to stay with us until she was able to afford to share an apartment with friends.  We have had a few speed bumps along the road with her being resistant to getting a job or helping clean around the house.\n\nLast week, she told us she was moving out and relocating states to live with her father.  We had no issue with this.  The day before she was supposed to move out, she told us her father said she is not welcome to stay and asked if she can continue staying with us.  We told her that was fine under certain conditions, including continuing to pay rent, continuing to work on her budget, getting out of the house a few days a week outside of work, learning to drive, and not sleeping all day between shifts.  When she called and spoke to her mother about this plan (my MIL), MIL said I brainwashed her into staying.\n\nOn Sunday night, MIL called me and profusely apologized for the negative comments because SIL had been lying to her this whole time.  Apparently, SIL called MIL 3 weeks ago crying saying we were being manipulative and mean.  We were forcing her to walk to work every day, even if she was working until 2 or 3am (her work is 1 mile away).  We were taking all her money and not allowing her to eat out of our groceries.  MIL was the one who suggested she move out and SIL agreed, but then when she changed her mind at the last minute, MIL was confused as to how that could be if she was so miserable with us.\n\nFIL also never said she couldn't stay with him.  He told her she would need to help around the house, work, pay rent, and not sleep all day.\n\nMy husband and I hate drama and are on the same page with this.  I am planning on going NC after she moves out as she caused issues between my in laws and me for the last 6 months.  I also don't want her having contact with my children, 7m, 4m, and 2f.  I don't want her living with us anymore, but she has no other options currently.  We do not live close to MIL or FIL and there is no other family nearby.

My partner and I are around the same age as your SIL. Last year we let my partners sister (18 years old) move in with us under almost the exact same conditions ($400 rent, get a job, contribute in some way to household needs like groceries and other supplies, find your own way to work). \n\nI can\u2019t say it was the most successful arrangement, but she had no problems with our terms and we had only a few issues related to cleaning up after herself and small things like that. She was also doing online college for most of her stay. My partner and I have since moved for work and she moved back in with their mom and has continued working, paying rent, and going to school with no issues.\n\nIf an 18 year old with basically zero prior life experience can get it together and be an adult, then someone with a decade more life experience certainly can. Idk what\u2019s wrong with your SIL but whatever is going on with her has nothing to do with you as you guys have been really accommodating for a grown adult. She sounds incredibly lazy and seems to want to take advantage of people who love her instead of putting in the hard work to build a stable life.", "The SIL - she's a lying, manipulative person who tried to drive a wedge between you and you in-laws. She's trying to create dissension in the family and use it to her advantage. I fail to see how you might be wrong to get her out of the house, to prevent any further manipulation or dissension in the family. Therefore, you are NTA. Clearly, definitely and completely NTA.\n\nThis SIL, though, is an outright disgraceful, treacherous and vile being. She is absolutely TA in this.", "NTA\n\nYou've given your SIL an opportunity.  And opportunity which she chose to squander.  You would not be the asshole for giving her notice (assuming you do so with proper notifications under your local law).\n\nIndeed, if you were to allow the current situation to continue indefinitely, you would likely be the asshole, on account of enabling her behavior and )although you don't say it explicitly) likely diverting attention and resources from your own children.", "NTA but you should be getting SIL to see a therapist for her mental health. Sleeping all day, not leaving the house or doing anything around the house are common symptoms of a few disorders. Before I was diagnosed with ADHD (at 27), I did the same things. I literally couldn't stay awake if it wasn't required for work (even that's tough). Also, 1 mile at 2am is a long walk for a woman alone. I don't even like my male partner walking 0.6m home after dark.", "NTA - this is the only way she'll learn and grow into a functioning adult.  Be firm. She has 60days to figure this out.  If she doesn't then she can move in with her parents. NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She is a grown adult who is lieing, manipulative and trying to take advantage of you guys. She is trying to find away to have someone to provide for her so she can sleep all day. She is also trying to create unnecessary conflict between you and your in-laws. She did this to her self.", "NTA.  Not your responsibility not your problem.  If she is lying to you about what her parents said and lying to them about what was going on, then i feel certain she is not above lying to your children about you and leading them astray.  I think 60 days is more than generous, 30 days is reasonable.\n\nI will predict now that she will cry, say she doesnt have money saved up and that she didnt say those things to her parents", "NTA. She is lying about you guys behind your back. I wouldn't want her in my home either.", "I had to go back and see that the SIL is 28\u2026almost 30 and still has to be told what to do since she isn\u2019t taking accountability for her life. On top of that, she is lying to everyone with the intent of manipulating them into thinking that you are making her life unbearable\u2026only to be told that her dad asked for the exact same thing that you were doing for her. \n\nYou\u2019ve gone above and beyond to help her understand her finances, but she probably intended on living with you as long as possible. She has no other option\u2014not even with the \u201cfriends\u201d she said she was going to save up for an apartment and move in with them. I don\u2019t think those people actually exist. \n\nYWNBTA", "Yeah by the time I read the post, I forgot we're dealing with a 28 year old here. She sounds like a teenager.", "I meant to include that we've offered to drive her or let her use the car (she has a driver's license) and she's said no to both.", "We have suggested therapy but her current job doesn't provide health benefits and she hasn't looked into other options. Unfortunately, if we don't do the legwork, nothing gets done.", "If SIL is 28 and has been living her life this way for so long I\u2019m not sure if OP and her husband would really have the power to make her see a therapist if she doesn\u2019t want to. With this behavior I would be surprised if this were the first time someone suggested she get help. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t put that responsibility on OP or her husband. They have several of their own actual\n Children to care for. If SIL wants to act like a child then she should go back to living with her parents. MIL and FIL have offered to take her in, I think OP and her partner are being very generous giving her so much time to either make a decision about moving in their parents or going elsewhere."]}
