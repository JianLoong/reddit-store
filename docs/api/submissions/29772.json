A memorial service is definitely not required.\n\nAt least in the US a funeral is not required either - disposing of the body is required, but in some places you can donate the body to a medical school. A funeral is for those who care about the deceased, and that's not OP. If others wanted a funeral, they should be on the hook for the expense, not OP.", "I looked into donating my body to a medical school or to scientific research after I die. The criteria was tough, they don't want most people's bodies. They want bodies in the pink of health, no chronic illnesses, degenerative disorders, addiction damage, and no operations to have removed vestigial organs or replace joints or wear and tear of old age. Basically, could you please die in a way that doesn't cause any abnormality to your body's physiology, after having lived in an unflinching state perfect heath to an age no later than your mid-30s, thank-you.", "Wasn't true for my father. He was 80+ and the local medical school was happy to pay for his body to be transported over an hour to get there.\n\nI'm going to guess it depends heavily on jurisdiction."]}
