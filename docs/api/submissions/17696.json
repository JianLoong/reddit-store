We have a path that cuts through our neighborhood that is pretty popular and has a decent amount of traffic that we regularly walk along.  \r  \n\r  \nThis morning about 50 yards in front of us the lady in front of us stops and pets and chats for a second with a dog and its owner.  The lady that was petting keeps on moving.  We approach the dog and owner coming the other way and she asks if I would pet her dog to help socialize it.  I say no thank you.  The look on her face was of a form of disappointment, like no one had told her no to that question yet.  I don\u2019t like dogs and don\u2019t want to interact with strange ones let alone pet them.  \r  \n\r  \nAs the wagon passes by, the lady goes what a sweet baby and lets the dog put its paws on the wagon.  I quickly pull the wagon away  and confront the lady.  I aggressively tell her to keep her dog away from my son.  She says she was just admiring the baby and the dog was leashed so my son was safe. She calls me an asshole.  I tell her you aren\u2019t controlling your dog very well, it should not have put its paws up on the wagon.

The ideal owner shouldn't let their dog put their paws on any property or people at all without clearly expressed consent and good reason.\n\nYeah maybe you could've overreacted a bit, but you're valid in asking them to keep their distance. She's the asshole for not respecting that.", "NTA. You have literally no idea how that dog will behave. If it's \"being socialized,\" it's being trained, which means it could behave erratically. I wouldn't trust a strangerdog (I just made that word up) around a baby either.", "As a dog lover myself you are completely NTA. You gave a polite refusal and that should have been that. The dog should not have done that to the wagon. \n\nI don't care how well trained someone thinks their dog is but in public not everyone wants to interact with dogs and plenty of people have had serious trauma from dogs. You don't know this lady or this animal and have a small child to protect. Both the lady and that other rando who commented both suck here.", "NTA\n\nAny respectable dog owner would apologize for their dog jumping on a stranger or their property, especially in the presence of child, and especially after you've already indicated you do not want to interact with the dog. \n\nNot everyone likes dogs. I'm not hanging out with those people, but they're allowed to have their feelings \ud83d\ude01", "NtA. There are so many safety reasons why you may want to keep a dog away from you and your children. \n\nHow did this lady know you or your child did not have allergies.  Or been attacked beforehand.\n\nShe asked you said no. No. Is a full sentence.  \n\nI had this lady walk by my house, dog off leash. I asked her to not let her dog walk all over my property.  Told her my spouse had allergies.  Got \"puppy is old and does not like to be on a leash and is just exploring a bit\" and got upset when I again asked for her to remove her dog from my yard. \n\nTo top it off the lady did not have bags to pick up after her dog. Thankfully I got her to move along before business was done...\n\nI understand to many people their dog is family, but it is not everyone's pride and joy. Not everyone wants their dog around.", "NTA - The dog's mouth was at your child's head height. Once you said 'no' to her socializing question she should have controlled her dog (command, distraction or leash) to not touch the wagon. It is common courtesy. \"Admiring the baby.\" is a lame and meaningless statement.\n\nRespectful pet owners understand anyone has the right to not engage with their dog and the reasons vary including fearful past experience(s). Best to you.", "NTA. \n\nAllowing her dog to invade your kid's space AFTER YOU TOLD HER NO is ridiculous.\n\nMaybe your kid is scared of dogs. Or allergic.\n\nSounds like she's exactly the sort of entitled dog owner that gives the rest of us a bad name.", "NTA\n\nI am a dog lover and this lady's entitlement pisses me off. You were very polite and clear. No means no. You and your baby are not a training tool for her dog. Pet owners who act like this give responsible owners a bad name.", "NTA. I guess some people can't take no for an answer without feeling offended", "NTA for not wanting to pet the dog", "NTA. I have dogs and wouldn\u2019t let them near kids especially if the parent clearly didn\u2019t want the dog near them.", "NTA.\n\nI really like dogs and pet them any chance I get. However, you should never pet a dog if you think one of the following doesn't want it: the owner, the dog and you.\n\nIf you are for one reason or another reluctant, you will be tense and dogs are much better than humans at reading body language. When they feel thst someone who doesn't really like them touches them, they could get nervous and act in a way that everyone will regret.", "This woman thinks it's Ok for a dog that's not yet socialized (or even a socialized dog, any dog)  to have its paws in a wagon with a baby against the parent's instructions?!?!  (Because we all know that if a dog is on a leash it can't possibly hurt a baby in proximity to its jaws...right...)\n\nThere is nothing you could have said to her that wouldn't be called for; no tone of voice too indignant; no decibel level too loud; no swearing too intense.\n\nYou went full-on mama bear.  You protected your kid.  It doesn't matter what anyone else thinks of how you did it.  You shouldn't have had to be in a position in which it was necessary in the first place.\n\nNTA", "NTA. It literally takes a second for a child to have its face mauled. I don't care how well behaved people say their pet is, it's still an animal. I would have told her to back off and stay away from me too.", "NTA.  Once you said no that should have been it.  The other guy should have minded his business.", "NTA. You don't know the dog, and there are enough delusional dog owners out there that you have no obligation to trust their assessment of their dog's likely behavior, especially if the dog is still being socialized. The leash isn't going the dog in time if the dog is starting just inches from your son.", "I am a huge dog lover and animal advocate. I always have control of my dog when we are walking and am particularly mindful when we pass other people and dogs.  \n\nAlthough I can appreciate the effort to socialize the dog, no way would I have allowed my dog to jump towards the wagon.  That shows that she does not have good control of her dog and your reaction was appropriate.   NTA.", "[deleted]", "ESH. She shouldn't have allowed her dog to put its paws on your baby's wagon, but you did overreact. You could have just said you didn't like that. Telling her to keep away from you and your property was too much.", "ESH\n\nShe was absolutely out of line by letting her dog come in contact with the wagon, but you definitely overreacted.  A simple, \"Please don't let your dog get so close to my son,\" should have sufficed as you pulled the wagon away and left.

I will take any opportunity to socialise them with kids, other animals, etc.\n\nBut the SECOND someone says no? It's over, I take my girls away. I have NO FUCKING RIGHT to force my dogs onto people, however much I love and trust them - because the other person has ZERO reason to believe me, to trust me, or to risk anything. \n\nIn the interests of full disclosure, I'll admit it's a little more difficult to separate dogs from people in my house, but we still try. This shit matters, and even if a socialising opportunity is lost a training opportunity is provided so I've never considered it a penalty for the dog to be rejected by a stranger.", "I'm not disagreeing with you, just wanted to comment that socialisation is a life long thing - dogs don't get a pass grade and then maintain it, we have to actively maintain social activities to ensure they behave consistently. This doesn't make them any more predictable to a stranger (especially when the owner acts as awfully as the one OP encountered) so your comment is absolutely valid.\n\nBut I wanted to add: for those who are borderline on engaging with strange dogs you can ask how much socialisation/ social experience the dog already has. You'll be told then if you're facing a rescue in training (run away), an inexperienced pup (worth risking imho), or a mature well -trained dog (safest of the three options). And if they can't or won't answer that question, gtfo because they don't know what they're doing, and the dog cannot be trusted.", "I raised my voice, not quite yelling but increased its volume.  I stepped toward her, I did not touch the lady or her dog.  I probably cussed, but can't remember what I said exactly.", "Letting dog approach a baby after parent's refusal is a big fucking no. Dog owner is irresponsible as fuck and deserves much more reaction than she got.", "Fuck that why do people think they can force their dogs on you these days", "OP had already declined the interaction nicely, the woman absolutely needed to be told off. It takes a fraction of a second for a dog to snap and bite someone, not to mention the child could have been afraid of dogs, or have extreme allergies. \n\nIf you ask me a question,  blatantly ignore my answer, and cross my boundaries damn straight I'm going to get in your face.\n\nOP is NTA", "[deleted]", "I totally agree.

I also grew up scared of dogs so do everything I can to get my kids comfortable with them.\n\nI personally do think you kind of overreacted.\n\nThat said, my wife would\u2019ve screamed at the lady.  And if someone told her she overreacted they would receive a tongue lashing.\n\nMy wife is the smart one in our house.\n\nThe dog owner was AH.  The guy who said you overreacted was probably AH as well.", "You sound like an angry jerk, tbh.", "NTA. \n\nSeveral years back, I was with my kids at a local park that has lots of families and kids. My oldest was about five. Fiveish. Maybe fourish?\n\nAnyway, there was a dog there who was with a family. My daughter wanted to pet the dog and I said to her that we don\u2019t pet strange dogs and to please give it some space. No biggie. No further story. \n\nUntil several years later. I\u2019m at school and a mom comes up to me. She says, \u201cI remember you. We were at the park and I was with my dog. You wouldn\u2019t let your daughter pet him. I thought you were kind of a dick for it.\u201d\n\nI was kind of stunned and didn\u2019t respond.\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019m an ER Nurse. And not a month after that, we had a doctor come in that had his face completely degloved by a dog that was supposedly a nice dog. I kept thinking about you and your daughter. And I want to say I\u2019m sorry and you were right. You never know.\u201d\n\nAbsolutely true story. 100%. \n\nNever let a dog owner tell you how their dog should invade your space.", "NTA. You had already said no to socializing her dog.

Has baby but weird about dogs.", "The issue isn't even the strangerdog (I agree, great word), it's the owner. Why should I trust their judgement? And in a case like this, the owner is showing bad judgement.", "What does having a baby have anything to do with being weird about dogs? It's not weird to not want a strangers dog around your child.", "Strangerdog is doubly risky when paired with its handler, AHowner", "NTA\n\nSocializing is not just letting every person you see pet your dog - that's how you get a dog that *expects* to be petted by everyone they see. So you'll easily get a dog that will pull towards people on walks, and throw a tantrum if someone doesn't pet it.\n\nSocialization is about *getting your dog used to multiple things* - people, other dogs and animals, different environments, vehicles and so on. Good socializing means that your dog will *ignore* people, dogs and whatnot, and only interact with them when their owner lets them.\n\nOf course it's okay to ask people to meet their pup, but if they refuse that's okay, the puppy needs to learn that sometimes you just walk past. This lady was absolutely in the wrong, especially after letting the dog go up to the wagon with your baby in there!\n\n**Other people are not your training props.** Accept a no.\n\nThis post reminded me of what my friend once told me. So he is afraid of dogs because he was attacked by a big dog once. He was walking on a sidewalk when a lady with an off-leash dog walked towards him. The lady called out \"Don't worry, he's friendly! You'll be a part of our training!\" To which my friend replied \"No I will not, I'm afraid of dogs and will not come closer until you leash yours.\"\n\nApparently the lady had looked like she'd never even considered that someone could be afraid of dogs. She did leash her dog and all's well that ends well I guess. Though that wasn't a place where you could keep your dog off-leash anyway. And just expecting other people to be fine with off-leash dogs is not okay.", "It's weird she even asked in a busy area tbh, anyone with a dog knows that it gets plenty of pats in a busy area without you doing anything... lots of hey buddy, oh how cute, can i pet your dog....wouldn't want to have a dog if i was an introvert ahaha", "Man I walk my boy too in the morning. Some people have all of the audacity. Don\u2019t randomly touch my kid and don\u2019t be butthurt when I tell you to BTFO. He\u2019s cute and will wave but hands off.", "NTA\nYou told them no, so she tried to introduce her dog to your baby?  That's several steps beyond offering a stranger dog a pat.", "Nta at all, dog people are so entitled it's so annoying.", "NTA - Even if its a well behaved dog, they have sharp claws and sharp teeth, and can easily accidently scratch someone.  \n\n\nI have two medium dogs, when playing with them it's so easy for their paws to accidently scratch me.", "How is that too much? It should've been common understanding to not let the dog do that, but as the dog owner didn't stop the dog and defended it, it clearly needed to be said directly. Saying \"I don't like that\" wasn't going to cut it."]}
