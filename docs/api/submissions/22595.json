I said I didn't want them because I shouldn't have them, so my daughter asked if she could have them instead of them going to waste. I told her yes she could and she asked if I could get her a special sauce too, which I did.\n\nWhen I got in the car, I only wanted a few just for on the road, so I ate about maybe 4-5 of the larger waffle fries in the carton, but left her a solid 1/3 of the rest. When I showed up and handed her the bag with her portion of the fries, she was visibly disappointed and accused me of being the \"AH\" because they were HERS she specifically requested and I shouldn't have eaten them. She said there were barely any in there (I checked, there were a good 2-3 big fries with the rest being crumbled a bit).\n\nAITA here?\n\nEdit: Also I wanted to comment that I didn't offer to go back and get her more, only because it's such a long drive away, and I don't feel like I had to given they came with my meal in the first place.", "created_utc": 1689714144, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/153ab5i/aita_for_eating_fries_that_werent_mine/", "score": 1515, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You show up with your meal, and hand her 1/3 what she was expecting (which was already pretty small).\n\nIf this had been a friend instead of your child, you would not have eaten them, or you would have offered *some* of the fries. But because you have the parent mentality here, YOU bought the fries, they were originally attatched to YOUR meal, and that makes them YOUR fries that you are simply allowing her to consume. Parents need to realize that their child is another human being and you need to keep promises and treat them fairly. You promised her fries, she expected the fries, you gave her less than half of the fries. I wont comment on your dietary needs because i dont know how big a deal it is, but the correct way to go about this if you decide you want them is get your own fries when ordering or if they are pre ordered, just order another small fry at the window, and eat those. If you dont want the whole thing, give the rest of THOSE fries to her along with what you promised, or just eat the whole thing if you were going to eat most of an order of fries in the first place, OR, wait until you get home and say, i know i said you could have them, but could i have a few of your fries please, OR wait until you know you dont want them or have already eaten what you wanted before you even offer them, it\u2019s not like it\u2019s a matter of changing your order if she doesnt want then, because you ate them anyways. You could even do none of that and just apologize, which im guessing you didnt based on the post here.\n\nAll that being said, the only real issue here is you not upholding your word, which is easily fixable, and i suggest you do so in the future, other than that, this is a relatively small issue and not really a reflection of you as a person, but in this specific scenario, YTA if you dont apologize.", "YTA you said you\u2019d give her all your fries and by your own admission you left her 1/3 of the bag?\n\nDoesn\u2019t sound like you care much about your health at all.", "This reminds me of that South Park episode where Cartman ate all the skins off fried chicken from KFC.", "YTA.  \nYou: it comes with fries but I can\u2019t eat them.\"\nHer:  (thinks \"I was going to order fries anyway\") can I have them?\nYou: yes.
