I said I didn't want them because I shouldn't have them, so my daughter asked if she could have them instead of them going to waste. I told her yes she could and she asked if I could get her a special sauce too, which I did.\n\nWhen I got in the car, I only wanted a few just for on the road, so I ate about maybe 4-5 of the larger waffle fries in the carton, but left her a solid 1/3 of the rest. When I showed up and handed her the bag with her portion of the fries, she was visibly disappointed and accused me of being the \"AH\" because they were HERS she specifically requested and I shouldn't have eaten them. She said there were barely any in there (I checked, there were a good 2-3 big fries with the rest being crumbled a bit).\n\nAITA here?\n\nEdit: Also I wanted to comment that I didn't offer to go back and get her more, only because it's such a long drive away, and I don't feel like I had to given they came with my meal in the first place.", "created_utc": 1689714144, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/153ab5i/aita_for_eating_fries_that_werent_mine/", "score": 138, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You keep trying to downplay that you just had a few of them, by you ate 2/3 of the order and only left her like 3 fries. Come on man. What kind of dad eats his daughter's fries and doesn't look her in the eye?\nDaddy why did you eat her fries?", "Not only the ff, but you shouldn\u2019t be eating the white bread on the chicken sandwich either. YTA, to your daughter and to yourself.", "*daddy*\n*why did you eat my fries* \n\ud83e\udddb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "This is reminding me of another recent story in which an alcoholic with cirrhosis of the liver was drinking and SIL got upset, while that OP didn\u2019t understand why SIL was getting upset. \n\nYTA. You know you can\u2019t eat this stuff, and you gave the fries to your daughter.", "There is a song about this xd\n\nAlso YTA", "At that point you should have bought two orders. A small for you and the other for her, if you don\u2019t finish, you give her the rest. YTA.", "So what I\u2019m gathering from your post is that you wanted the fries, you were planning on eating the fries, but you know you shouldn\u2019t have them so you called them your daughter\u2019s fries so they \u201cwouldn\u2019t count\u201d somehow. \n\nYTA to your daughter because you offered her fries and then ate most of them. \n\nYTA to yourself because you\u2019re doing mental gymnastics to justify eating stuff you shouldn\u2019t.", "YTA.  I\u2019m sure she would have ordered her own fries if you told her you\u2019d eat some of them before giving them to her.   If you ate 4-5 big ones and left 2-3 big ones and crumbs, then you ate more than half.    She was expecting an order of fries and got three.", "completely different story if he just gets the meal, doesn\u2019t get her hopes up, then goes \u201chey I waved you a few fries!\u201d", "Not to mention, his daughter may be legit concerned that he's eating fries (and fast food in general) while being diabetic.", "I would cry if someone did that to me.", "Tbf I just looked up waffle fries and they're not like regular French fries, so it's not that bad, but he still broke his word.", "But but but! He also let her have the crumbles at the bottom of the fry container! She got all of those!\n\n/s.\n\nThe audacity on OP.", "I'm not passing judgement with this comment, but I definitely wouldn't turn down a free 33 dollars even if told 100 at first. \n\nReally he is TA, but that was a pretty bad analogy.", "I can tell you that as a diabetic, the serving size for the sandwich alone is 1/4 to about 1/3. No fries or drinks. \n\nIt's better to get a small nugget and side salad if you want a full order and have water.\n\nOP is an AH. He's got an eating disorder/self control issue if he can't drive home without snacking on the fries.", "Thank you this is exsactly what I feel. Also op you act like my mom. I have food issues still at 28 due to her YTA", "And, it being CFA, as long as they have the ingredients in house, they will make or do about anything. I get 8am salads. Friends have gotten Mac and cheese grilled cheese. They, for sure, would sell a sandwich without fries. Heck, you can get fruit/soup/Mac and cheese/kale salad as a side. Fries were a gift", "[deleted]", "I was on OP's at the start of \"I ate four or five\" and then firmly on the daughter's with \"left 1/3 for her\". OP almost all the fries by taking all the big ones! OP is such the AH. Just admit you are going to eat the fries, and account for it in your diet, because OP basically ate an order of fries but is not properly accounting for the carbs.", "Yeah, the side kale salad isn't an upcharge while the other sides are.

I can tell that you also appreciate and love me,  by the generous and thoughtful way you treat me /s", "No.", "But he says he left her 1/3 of the portion after promising her the whole portion. I'd be pissed to receive 1/3 of a portion of anything if I thought I was getting the whole thing, and his daughter probably would have just asked for her own fries or something similar if he didn't say she could have his.", "Wrong, most waffle fries are about 1 bite, maybe two if they happen to be huge but they rarely are.  He brought her literally 3 bites of food.  He might as well have just told his daughter she was the one with the diet problem since he ate them all and brought her, as he said, 1/3 of them.", "This is why OP has diabetes...

His diabetes got worse and now he needs some $1k/mo medicine for it because instead of buckling down and eating healthier, dude decimated an entire Oreo package in 24 hours.\n\nSucks to be the kid and know your parent will be gone sooner rather than later because they can't not eat excessive junk food.", "It's a statically true thing to say.

By thinking of me and bringing me free food. \n\nI can tell this thread is filled with children.", "Nah, dude.   Got four adult children,  and I don't treat them this way.   \"Dad tax\" isn't eating 2/3 of what you said you'd bring home for her.  And she might have asked for her own fries,  but didn't,  because dad said she could have his, but instead ate nearly all of them.   Being mean and selfish,  then expecting your children to effusively praise you for your imagined generosity is not a good look.   If your wife said she was bringing you home dinner,  but ate 2/3 of it on the way home,  would you be grateful to her?"]}
