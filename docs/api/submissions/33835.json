They robbed me after?", "selftext": "My Christmas budget for family ranged from $50-100, which is how much I spent last year. Yesterday I went to target with my dad to exchange something and ended up buying myself a MacBook and a 55inch tv. My dad made a comment how I must not have liked my gifts if I felt the need to treat myself like this. I told him I need these things for New Year\u2019s Eve and he didn\u2019t say anything else. When we got back to his house the rest of my family seemed annoyed with me and didn\u2019t understand what good deals they were. Later on I was telling them how I wanted to trade in my 2024 Buick encore gx for something bigger like a ford escape which caused my mom and dad to go off on me and tell me how greedy and selfish I am. I left their house after this and later tonight when I was getting something from my wallet realized my debit card was missing. I looked in the app and there were $1500 worth of charges from Walmart. I called my mom crying and she said my brothers were just there she\u2019ll have them go back up maybe someone turned it in like??? They clearly stole it and went on a shopping spree!! I drove to their house to confront them and my brothers were denying it. My mom and dad kept asking them if they did anything and they both said no. I told them I was going to call the police on them then my parents told me I had no proof and I most likely left it at target and someone else stole it. I have my card locked now but I know they did this. My mom and dad both said it was hurtful for me to accuse them of stealing but it\u2019s so obvious! Especially bc the younger one has posted a video on snap chat of him singing karma by t swift. I told them I will file a complaint with the police bc this snap chat video is proof they robbed me.
