(Happens from time to time, zoos decide that particular animals might be better off at once facility than another).\n\nWe left in one of our transport vans around 2pm. I took two keepers with me - let's call them Seth (who's been around as a swing keeper for a few years, has a bit of cat experience) and Megan (fairly new to the industry, brought her partially for the experience and partially because she was the only other one who wanted some extra hours working late).\n\nWe arrive at 6pm and get to see these two beautiful cheetahs, and Seth helps me get them loaded into our crates. \n\nHe does ask \"shouldn't we wait for them to go potty before driving back with them,\" which I know is a common practice sometimes, but I said nah, it could be hours, and the van smells of animals already - we'll be getting back late enough as it is. So they agreed and we headed back.\n\nIt was a bit cramped but we made it work. Megan sat up front with me and Seth sat in the back with the cheetah crates (had to keep them in the passenger compartment to observe them / make sure they're ok).\n\nThe drive back went fine until right before the 3 hour mark, predictably, one of the cheetahs relieved itself. Seth said \"oh, oh no it went,\" and a few seconds later the smell hit us up front. Honestly to me it just smelled like healthy cheetah poo - I was mostly just happy to know the cheetah we got was healthy! It sprayed too (intact male cheetah) which did make it worse.\n\nWhen the smell hit Megan though she started gagging saying \"oh my god it's atrocious.\" I agreed, but kept driving. Less than a minute later she said \"Please can we pull over, I'm going to be sick,\" I said that it'll be hard to clean this, it's only another hour and a half tops, but she said \"I don't know if I can make it an hour in this.\"\n\nI really hoped we could make it back, but when even Seth lost his composure and started retching I knew this wasn't good, and Megan was practically crying, so I relented and pulled off at the next exit and pulled up behind a gas station to clean the crate, but not before Megan threw up. Seth had to help me transfer the cheetah and then we cleaned the crate and Megan's vomit.\n\nThen we got back in, but Megan recoiled and gagged, saying the van still reeked of vomit, cheetah poo and spray, which was true. She asked if we could let it air out for another hour, but I said no, sorry, it'd barely help and we need to be getting back.\n\nShe looked ill and miserable the whole drive back and has been a bit standoffish to me since. I'm not her regular direct manager so it's not really my place to intervene. Seth did say the next day \"That's what I was afraid of,\" but I think my actions were justified.\n\nAITA\n\ntl;dr didn't pull over right away when cheetah had an \"accident,\" coworker got sick", "created_utc": 1680797034, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12dou6f/aita_for_not_pulling_over_at_my_coworkers_request/", "score": 307, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

OP was being a good steward of the animals they were entrusted to move. Longer time in the holding cages = more stress on the animal and the possibility of it injuring itself or falling ill due to stress lowered immunity.\n\nIt sounds like Megan isn't cut out to work with large animals if she couldn't handle the smell of normal big cat bodily functions without becoming ill. Perhaps she will grow into the roll, but unpleasant smells, getting pissed, shat, and thrown up on are all a part of working with animals - as well as the possibility of getting clawed, bitten, nipped, or kicked/stomped.

The patient suddenly defecates and urinates himself. It stinks terribly. The others want to hurl. Do you pull over or continue? Do you pull over, and do you wait to air out the cabin?

Did they minimize negative effects when they had to transfer the cheetah and clean up vomit behind a gas station? \n\nNo. So he was also an asshole to himself and the cheetahs.\n\nYTA, OP.", "That's true, and also not relevant to whether or not it was OK for OP to refuse to stop when she asked.\n\nBeing in the wrong profession does get mean people get to ignore your requests to stop when you feel sick.", "Yeah, even the wait for them to go but - unless the zoo you fetched them from know exactly when they last relived themselves, you could be waiting hours and it\u2019s already overtime plus needing to offload two large and dangerous animals at the end of the journey. And they might still go anyway, 9/10 times my dogs go multiple times when they do go. \nAlso if they were on a motorway (considering it\u2019s long distance they may well have been) you can\u2019t just pull over, it\u2019s Dangerouse to stop there and shouldn\u2019t be done if you can help it, car breaks down, can\u2019t help it. Vehicle and driver are fine and can drive to a safer place to stop and actually address the issue? Yeah that\u2019s what you do.\nIf he could safely pull over to give them a minute to adjust then yeah, but the flip side is it\u2019s 7 hours into an 8 hour round trip (not including loading and h loading the big cats) you\u2019d want to just get home, you know fresh air will make going back into the stink box worse and the person who can\u2019t stand it is in the passenger seat, they can open the window and have their face to it. \n\nJust Seems like a crap day where the exp people had a better idea of what to expect than the new person, who puked. Sucks for everyone but there\u2019s not actually a lot anyone could have done without adding many hours to the trip when they have both dangerous and pooping cargo.", "That\u2019s fair but they knew they were going to go at some point, even getting the crates out half way through the journey to let them go outside the car and cleaning the crates outside the car might have helped.", "3 interns were cleaning the otter habitat after breeding season \n\n(we can't go in there to clean during breeding season so it does get pretty rank by the time it's time to clean. It's a pretty unpleasant and time-consuming job but has to be done).\n\n2 were toughing it out, one was clearly hanging back and trying not to get too dirty and smelly. \n\nWhen the manager noticed he re-assigned the other two to much easier tasks and told the squeamish one she'd have to spend the rest of the day doing it herself.\n\nTo her credit she got through it, many interns have quit in such cases. She **stunk** like absolute hell even the next day though, I remember moving away from her in the employee lounge!", "That makes sense. Thanks for taking the time to elaborate!", "Lol I'm remembering when I worked at a sanctuary and a coworker told me he smelled something \"different\" from the bears today - that their poo reeked different than it usually did.\n\nHe asked me to observe the bears to see which bear made which poo, and sniff all their poo as I cleaned it until I found out which bear had the issue. Then had to take it back and dissect it, turned out there were worms.\n\nThe things they make you do in this field \ud83e\udd22\ud83e\udd22", "Wow it's *common* for workers to throw up? That's crazy to me, I would have thought they get used to it.\n\nWhat sort of smells are causing that? Even seasoned professions go through that?", "How else do you think one acquires tolerance but to volunteer and work on building it? She did a pretty kick ass job for a first time experience.", "Says everyone that is wrong and has nothing better to do.", "If the animal requires that there are no pit stops, there will be no pit stops. The girl didn\u2019t come prepared with a barf bag - next time she\u2019ll bring one. Or resign. People who work with animals are used to putting animals first.", "that\u2019s just general knowledge, animal transport is meant to be done as quickly as possible to reduce the stress the animals go through during transport", "Actually it does. Minimizing trauma to the animal is the number one priority. Comfort of the zookeeper is far down the list.", "Huh? Cheetahs won't just poop on command", "You want them to take two wild Cheetahs out to pee on the side of the road? That's probably against protocol when they transfer these animals. Safety first and the safest thing is to get them into the zoo as soon as possible.", "That\u2019s just bad behaviour.", "I kind of want to work with otters, why does it seem like zookeepers tend to want to avoid that role \ud83d\ude02. Surely the cuteness is worth the occasional mess?", "How'd it know it would be otters \ud83d\ude02", "I mean not everyone. I don\u2019t find it that bad. It\u2019s just that in field season new field techs come with you and they might not be use to it. If I\u2019m overtired though I do react. You never know. I\u2019ve had to transport dead animals too so the rotting smell sends me", "By taking it slowly, not locking yourself in a small box with them for 8 hours (with a break in the middle, yes).", "Right and if OP had dedicated some word count to the animals welfare rather than the inexperience of the woman in question, and that they were going to be back late anyway and he didnt want to be home any later, my judgment might have been different.\n\nBut he didn't.\n\nPlus what ended up happening actually meant the animals were travelling longer than they would have because they had to get cleaned out.", "According to OP, why didn't he stop?", "I never said they did. But its worth just waiting to see if they\u2019d go, OP clearly knew they\u2019d go at some point", "Yes. In their crates as i said. Better than letting it soak into the upholstery", "They're mustelids, a famously horrible smelling class of mammals. Genuinely awful. They also eat primarily gish-based diets. So oily, fish-based poop that REEKS. The mess is not occasional, nor is the smell. There is literally almost nothing worse isln all of zoo-keeping.", "I imagine some animals have more pungent smells than others", "At some point. That could be hours. I\u2019m going to poop at some point and even I can\u2019t tell you when  That will be.", "So they should have waited 3 hours before going?", "You absolutely have zero clue about non-domesticated animals. Everything you are proposing will cause so much more stress to the animals.", "That had to go to a gas station to clean them, they didn't have the equipment with them. So it wouldn't have help to sit on the side of the road.", "Yup. If they don\u2019t have the correct vehicle that separates the two compartments then they need to make allowances for that", "Getting them out of a vehicle for an hour or so is more stressful than keeping them in the vehicle?", "So right.\n\nAnd I am dying at the idea of keepers caring about the upholstery in their animal transport vehicles.", "I mean if they never went in the car the smell wouldn\u2019t have been soaked into the seats so it would have helped", "So it would be perfectly fine to have one of the cheetahs die because they waited? And yes, that can and does happen.", "Anytime you're unloading and loading them is introducing more risk. Love how everyone is suddenly an animal expert except OP, the zookeeper with a decade of experience", "Absolutely. You get from A to B as fast as safely possible with minimal moves of the animals and their crates.", "Lol what how would they die", "I never said i was an animal expert but i know a thing or two about transporting goods. \n\nIf its going to be a problem you wait, if you can\u2019t wait then thats a you problem", "Once again if you don\u2019t have the appropriate vehicle to move them thats a you problem and you should be planning ahead to account for the time you might have to wait", "Where does it ever allude to it not being an appropriate vehicle? Now you are just making things up. The vehicle was fine. The issue was an inexperienced keeper. But the driver shouldn't pull over unless emergency, they shouldn't delay transport for animal to poop and you never remove crates off the transport vehicle during the drive so they can poop. You minimize the time an animal is out of it's habitat/enclosure and in a crate. You keep the transport as short as possible and go from A to B as fast as you safely can. And get the animal into its new habitat. \n\nYou clearly have zero clue on how much planning and preparation goes into an animal transport and all the safety parameters that have to be accounted for."]}
