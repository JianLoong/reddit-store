(Happens from time to time, zoos decide that particular animals might be better off at once facility than another).\n\nWe left in one of our transport vans around 2pm. I took two keepers with me - let's call them Seth (who's been around as a swing keeper for a few years, has a bit of cat experience) and Megan (fairly new to the industry, brought her partially for the experience and partially because she was the only other one who wanted some extra hours working late).\n\nWe arrive at 6pm and get to see these two beautiful cheetahs, and Seth helps me get them loaded into our crates. \n\nHe does ask \"shouldn't we wait for them to go potty before driving back with them,\" which I know is a common practice sometimes, but I said nah, it could be hours, and the van smells of animals already - we'll be getting back late enough as it is. So they agreed and we headed back.\n\nIt was a bit cramped but we made it work. Megan sat up front with me and Seth sat in the back with the cheetah crates (had to keep them in the passenger compartment to observe them / make sure they're ok).\n\nThe drive back went fine until right before the 3 hour mark, predictably, one of the cheetahs relieved itself. Seth said \"oh, oh no it went,\" and a few seconds later the smell hit us up front. Honestly to me it just smelled like healthy cheetah poo - I was mostly just happy to know the cheetah we got was healthy! It sprayed too (intact male cheetah) which did make it worse.\n\nWhen the smell hit Megan though she started gagging saying \"oh my god it's atrocious.\" I agreed, but kept driving. Less than a minute later she said \"Please can we pull over, I'm going to be sick,\" I said that it'll be hard to clean this, it's only another hour and a half tops, but she said \"I don't know if I can make it an hour in this.\"\n\nI really hoped we could make it back, but when even Seth lost his composure and started retching I knew this wasn't good, and Megan was practically crying, so I relented and pulled off at the next exit and pulled up behind a gas station to clean the crate, but not before Megan threw up. Seth had to help me transfer the cheetah and then we cleaned the crate and Megan's vomit.\n\nThen we got back in, but Megan recoiled and gagged, saying the van still reeked of vomit, cheetah poo and spray, which was true. She asked if we could let it air out for another hour, but I said no, sorry, it'd barely help and we need to be getting back.\n\nShe looked ill and miserable the whole drive back and has been a bit standoffish to me since. I'm not her regular direct manager so it's not really my place to intervene. Seth did say the next day \"That's what I was afraid of,\" but I think my actions were justified.\n\nAITA\n\ntl;dr didn't pull over right away when cheetah had an \"accident,\" coworker got sick", "created_utc": 1680797034, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12dou6f/aita_for_not_pulling_over_at_my_coworkers_request/", "score": 7479, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Longer time in the holding cages = more stress on the animal and the possibility of it injuring itself or falling ill due to stress lowered immunity.\n\nIt sounds like Megan isn't cut out to work with large animals if she couldn't handle the smell of normal big cat bodily functions without becoming ill. Perhaps she will grow into the role, but unpleasant smells, getting pissed, shat, and thrown up on are all a part of working with animals - as well as the possibility of getting clawed, bitten, nipped, or kicked/stomped, and occasionally helping deliver young.

But people absolutely can and do get sick from wild animal pee and poop. https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/24021-leptospirosis\n\nWhat is leptospirosis?\n\nLeptospirosis is an illness caused by an infection with the bacteria Leptospira. You can get infected with Leptospira through abrasions or cuts in your skin, or through your eyes, nose or mouth.\n\nLeptospirosis is a zoonotic disease, which means it\u2019s transmitted between animals and humans. You can get infected through:\n\nDirect contact with pee (urine) or reproductive fluids from infected animals.\nContact with contaminated water or soil.\nEating or drinking contaminated food or water.\n\nHow does leptospirosis spread?\n\nLeptospirosis is usually spread to humans from animal pee containing the bacteria Leptospira. Almost any mammal (like rats, dogs, horses, pigs or cows) can get leptospirosis. They may have few or no symptoms of illness.\n\nAnimals with leptospirosis can contaminate water or dirt (soil), which spreads the bacteria to other animals or humans. You can get leptospirosis from:\n\nDirectly touching pee or other body fluids from an animal with leptospirosis.\nGetting contaminated water or soil in your eyes, nose or mouth or in a break in your skin.\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7148644/ \n\nCaptive cheetahs have been affected by a variety of diseases limiting the sustainability of these populations. To better understand these captive cheetah diseases on a global scale and determine if they impact wild cheetahs, several long-term studies have been conducted (Munson, 1993, Munson et al., 1999, Munson et al., 2005). As a species, cheetahs are considered more susceptible to disease than other carnivores and are carefully managed in captivity (Chapter 24). \n\nInfectious Disease\n\nAnthrax There have been multiple published and anecdotal cases of anthrax in wild and captive cheetahs (Ebedes, 1976, Good et al., 2008; J\u00e4ger et al., 1990; de Pienaar, 1961). Most outbreaks can be linked to contaminated carcasses fed to captive animals or concurrent outbreaks in other wildlife. Affected cheetahs may have increased respiratory rate and effort and can vomit (J\u00e4ger et al., 1990). Similar to other carnivores, cheetahs may have ventral and cervical edema, bloody nasal discharge, scleral congestion, and pulmonary edema (Good et al., 2008; J\u00e4ger et al., 1990). Serosurveys after an anthrax outbreak in Botswana found that only 1 of 16 potentially exposed cheetahs had antibodies (Good et al., 2008) and cheetahs in Namibia also do not have antibodies to anthrax (Switzer et al., 2016). These results support claims that cheetahs are susceptible because they have low levels of exposure (as they generally do not scavenge), thus infection is often fatal (Lindeque et al., 1998). Vaccination may be of benefit for certain high-risk populations as cheetahs do mount a potentially protective response to a commercially available anthrax vaccine (Turnbull et al., 2004).\n\nMycobacterium bovis Spillover infection of Mycobacterium bovis occurs in cheetahs in areas with infected hoofstock (Keet et al., 1996). Typical granulomatous lesions occur in the lungs of affected cats but the lower airways can also be affected, suggesting that environmental contamination and or direct spread from affected cheetahs is possible. It is unlikely that cheetahs would become maintenance hosts for the disease as their contact rates are relatively low. However, sporadic spill over both to and from cheetahs is a possibility, especially in endemic areas (De Vos et al., 2001).\n\nSarcoptic Mange Wild cheetahs in the Masai Mara in East Africa have been diagnosed with mange associated with Sarcoptes scabei infection that is a significant infectious cause of morbidity and mortality (Mwanzia et al., 1995). One study found the prevalence in cheetahs to be 12.8% (Gakuya et al., 2012). Lesions in affected cheetahs include hair loss and thickening of the skin. Infection in cheetahs was associated with the dry season and in particular S. scabei infection in Thompson\u2019s gazelles.\nOther Health Problems\n\nOcular Trauma Traumatic eye injuries including scratches and lacerations to the lid, nictitans, and cornea, with penetration and secondary uveitis and cataracts, have been documented in free-ranging cheetahs in Namibia (Bauer, 1998). In rare cases, portions of thorns have been found within affected eyes leading to the hypothesis that the trauma is caused by encroachment of thorn bushes due to habitat degradation.\n\nImportant diseases in captivity\nInfectious Diseases\n\nHelicobacter-Associated Gastritis The majority of captive and wild cheetahs worldwide are infected with Helicobacter sp., spiral bacteria that colonize the stomach. In wild cheetahs there are numerous bacteria, but little to no associated inflammation (Terio et al., 2005). In contrast, captive cheetahs commonly have some degree of inflammation (gastritis; Fig. 25.1 ) that may be asymptomatic or associated with regurgitation, vomiting, passage of undigested feed, and weight loss (Eaton et al., 1993, Terio et al., 2011). Although gastric colonization with Helicobacter sp. can be confirmed using the urea breath test, antemortem diagnosis of gastritis requires histologic evaluation of endoscopic biopsies (Chapter 24).\n\nThe pathogenesis of gastritis is not completely understood. The absence of gastritis in the few cheetahs without evidence of ever being colonized by Helicobacter suggests that the bacteria play a role, but Helicobacter are not the only factor in disease development [Association of Zoos and Aquaria (AZA) Cheetah Species Survival Plan\u00ae (SSP) Pathology Archives, unpublished data]. In cheetahs, the distribution of T lymphocytes (T cells) and diffuse upregulation of MHC II expression on gastric epithelium are qualitatively similar to that in other species infec\n\nLongitudinal studies of gastritis in captive cheetahs have documented that while inflammation can wax and wane, in general, it worsens over time irrespective of treatment (Citino and Munson, 2005). Some lesions progress to fibrosis (scarring) and gastric atrophy that limits the ability of cheetahs to eat and digest a complete meal in one sitting (Citino and Munson, 2005, Terio et al., 2011). Although treatment with antibiotic triple therapy may provide short-term decrease in inflammation and eradication of Helicobacter, none of the treatments evaluated to date have had a significant effect on long-term Helicobacter infection or the lifelong progression of inflammation (Citino and Munson, 2005, Lane et al., 2004, Wack et al., 1997). \n\nHerpesvirus Captive cheetahs are commonly infected with feline herpesvirus and can develop mild sneezing, nasal discharge, and ocular lesions similar to other felids (van Vuuren et al., 1999). In some cases, severe corneal ulcers and/or keratitis and proliferative skin lesions on the face and/or forelimbs are noted (Flacke et al., 2015, Junge et al., 1991, Munson et al., 2004a, Munson et al., 2004b, Witte et al., 2013) (Fig. 25.2 ). Disease has not been noted in wild cheetahs despite evidence of viral exposure (Munson et al., 2004a, Munson et al., 2004b, Munson et al., 2005, Thalwitzer et al., 2010). Studies of the virus have found genetic and antigenic similarity with feline herpesvirus type 1 (FHV-1) (Scherba et al., 1988).", "Don\u2019t underestimate Fluffy \ud83d\ude02", "As well as the cheetah spray prob being more potent than Fluffly's", "Yeah, I can\u2019t imagine comparing the two.

When I am having intellectual/casual conversations with people I often assume knowledge is common that actually is not. For instance, when I say that no two people see the experience of living the same way I often mean something different than what most people think I mean. Most people think that phrase means that people all have different opinions about things but that is not at all what I\u2019m referring to (in fact it is so elemental that I don\u2019t even think of that part at all in general). What I mean is that the internal representation of reality and also the structures that translate incoming stimulus into thoughts are so different between people that there may be little to no overlap in what each person believes to have occurred in the same situation.\n\nTo give a small but profound example\u2014 some people have no ability to visualize and do not experience visuals at all in their thoughts. Other people do not have an internal voice or narrative thread (they don\u2019t think in words). There are many variations on how people experience their minds. Now imagine that two people are given a task to remember an event and one only thinks in words and never in pictures while the other thinks in pictures but never in words. The way that they each encode the experience will be so different that it may be difficult for them to reach a shared understanding of the experience.\n\nThe thing is, I often forget when talking or explaining something to others that this is not common knowledge and so it is easy for me to lose my conversation partner\u2019s understanding because I don\u2019t know what they don\u2019t know.\n\nIMO this is what is happening for you here. The OP failed to provide info that would have been helpful for you to understand the situation fully because they are too experienced to remember that most people don\u2019t know these things.\n\nAgain, however, I am really curious about why you are so opposed to being educated about it, when so many people have tried?

And while I don't have any experience with non domesticated animals, I have a few dogs, and it's pretty common knowledge that it stresses them out having to relieve themselves in their tiny environment like a crate.

If this is not the case with cheetahs, then you can ignore this part of the comment though.\n\nAnd the other thing is I dont really agree with your decision to not listen to Seth in the first place, and do what was common practice and wait a bit.

As the top comment says, the animals come first, but it reads like you only prioritised them once you actually had them in the car, and not before.   \n\nAnd finally, I don't think I can call Megan an asshole for asking these questions. She is new to the industry, had a big physical reaction, and then didn't push when you said no.

I get that Megan seemingly wasn't prepared for the smell, and as someone with a sensitive stomach in that sense, I definitely empathise with her; after a certain point, you really can't force yourself not to throw up if you definitely are going to. So in that respect her needing some air and whatnot is reasonable, she can't control her body's reaction, and presumably she didn't know how bad it could smell in a confined space and that she'd react that extremely, so I get it.\n\nBut animals gets stressed, sometimes easily, as I'm sure you know better than I or most people do. Being confined for hours and being driven for hours must be stressful to them, and it was important to get them to your zoo as soon as possible so you can get them in and settled. Delaying it by another hour or so isn't in the animals' best interests, which is pretty much you guys' job.\n\nI think it's unfair of Megan to treat you differently or blame you for putting the animals' needs first since stress in animals can be a big deal. But maybe she doesn't blame you, maybe she feels embarrassed or something even.", "Isn\u2019t this kind of an asshole move toward the *animal*?
