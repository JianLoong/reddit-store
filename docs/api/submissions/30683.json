Stop worrying about what others think...", "NTA\n\nSurnames are as relevant as names, you could have made one up, it actually doesn\u2019t matter. You gave the child the name you wanted it to have, it has nothing to do with the tragic story, him, her, them, or the donkey in the stables.\n\nEven if your mother was still around, you might have just thought it was a cool surname and picked it.

You're honoring your mother, you're happy, and your wife is happy.  There was never actually a *guarantee* that you would even keep your original last name.  Taking your wife's last name when you married was always an option.  Taking your mother's name when you reached adulthood was an option - and as others mention, certainly still is.
