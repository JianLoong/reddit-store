She is considerably more well off than me, so when we decided to move in together it wasn\u2019t even a discussion that I would leave my studio apartment and move into her gorgeous two bedroom condo. I sold off or threw away most of my cheap Amazon and IKEA furniture, mainly just bringing my personal items, my bed (which will go in her guest room) and my gigantic 82\u201d 4k flatscreen tv. I bought this tv less than a year ago, and was able to justify to myself that it was okay to spend a lot on it since I work in the entertainment business and watching movies is a big hobby of mine. I also love having friends over for football Sundays. My girlfriend has beautiful furniture, and decorated the inside of her condo to look like a design magazine spread. It really is nice. In her living room was a 50\u201d tv which we agreed I could replace with mine. She was on a girls trip in Vegas over the weekend while I moved my tv and other belongings into her condo. I even hired movers to help me and my friend get this giant tv up the stairs. My gf and I had already discussed that I was bringing it, and she had told me she would \u201callow it\u201d, but when she returned from her trip and saw the gigantic tv on the wall she was FURIOUS. She said it looked way too big in her living room (which is about twice the size as my old living room), and was ruining the \u201cvibe\u201d she had worked so hard to create in her condo. I will admit, it does look overly large mounted on her fireplace, as it hangs over the ends of it, making the room look a little smaller. But I explained a big tv is a big tv, and is obviously going to look, well, BIG in any room. She has decided she hates it and insisted that I sell it and purchase a smaller tv, perhaps a 65\u201d that will look nice on her fireplace. Not only would I be taking a huge financial loss by selling it, but I\u2019ll also have to spend even more to buy a new, smaller tv. Televisions are like used cars, they\u2019re worth a fraction used compared to brand new. I don\u2019t come from money like she does, and buying this tv was a huge deal to me. To now take a loss on it less than a year later because it \u201cdoesn\u2019t fit the vibe\u201d seems unreasonable. We now live together and I\u2019m extremely happy and excited for that, but she seems unhappy. I want us to make this place \u201cours\u201d, but this is really the only thing in the house that would be \u201cmine\u201d. Everything else  - all of the furniture, all of the decor, everything - is hers. If I sell it, I know I\u2019ll be upset about it, and am afraid I\u2019ll resent her for making me do it. On the other hand, I\u2019m afraid she\u2019ll resent me if I refuse. At the end of the day it is just a tv and I would choose my girlfriend over it every time, but this still just sucks and I feel like putting my foot down for once and saying I\u2019m keeping it so she\u2019ll have to get used to it.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1698075389, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17enb3m/aita_for_refusing_to_downsize_my_gigantic/", "score": 22, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

A 4k 80\"+ screen would literally be the lowest pixel density screen I own that isn't in a device from before 2008.", "Ah, ok. I wasn't trying to imply that because this move was beneficial to him, he shouldn't get a say in anything now that it's their shared apartment. Im sorry if it comes across that way!", "Well, a few days ago there was a post where a guys dog passed away and he wanted to put a huge picture of the dog up in the living room. My answer was essentially the same, N A H with acknowledgement that the bf was grieving and it might be best to let the picture stay up for a couple of months, and then rediscuss when the loss wasn't so fresh. \n\nUltimately I'd be on this guy's side, except for the fact that his TV is so massive. If it was \"she doesnt want me to display my lego builds on the bookshelf\" or \"she doesn't want my framed map of middle earth on the wall\" I'd be on his side. But a seven foot TV is so big, I think more nuance is needed here.", "The difference the human eye can see between 4K and 8k is something along the lines of a 3% increase in resolution(I am sure this isn\u2019t the exact number but don\u2019t feel like opening google. I know it\u2019s single digits.) with that minor of a change an overwhelming majority of humans wouldn\u2019t  be able to tell the difference if they where side by side.\n\nEta to fix a quick screw up between would and wouldn\u2019t thanks to being on mobile and not proof reading \ud83d\ude02", "Companies spend millions of dollars manufacturing 8k TV sets because they can convince people to pay more to buy them.  This does not mean the TV delivers advantages in the real world.  There is no evidence that 8K media will be widespread within the next 8-10 years, which is the lifespan of the TV set, and even less that the buyer will notice the difference in normal viewing conditions.", "Agree.", "I have no idea what you are trying to assert here. What do you mean by resolution? If you are talking about the resolution of the display it is 400%. If you are talking about perceived detail that is distance dependent. If you stand 50' away sure there is no difference but if you are an inch away it is clear as day. I can literally go to an electronics store right now and can tell the difference at reasonable distances. You sound like one of those people who says that \"the eye can only see 60hz\" so refresh rates higher than that are pointless."]}
