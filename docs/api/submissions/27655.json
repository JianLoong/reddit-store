She must have been 17 then. She did well, completed the basic tasks I gave her. I gave her a good review which she needed for school and that was the last I heard from her until recently. \n\nI work for the CEO of a very important company so having my name down as a reference tends to do pretty well on CV\u2019s. Before she left, she asked if she could put me down as a reference and I said that was fine. \n\nShe contacted me a few weeks ago asking for help getting a job. I explained I wouldn\u2019t be able to directly get her a job at my company (company policy, fair recruitment and all that) but I would help her do her CV as I know what lands well. She sent me her CV which was a complete mess. I spent 2 hours working on it late Friday after work, sent it back to her to add some additional bits that were missing, along with some positions in our company that I thought she had a good chance of getting. \n\nI sent the email and I didn\u2019t hear anything back. The jobs I sent closed. I texted her in case she missed my email from a few days before and she\u2019s blocked me on WhatsApp! \n\nI thought she must have changed her mind and thought nothing else of it. Until I get back from holiday last week and I have an email from another company requesting me to compete a questionnaire about her as she had me down as her reference. \n\nI was furious. Not only did she take the CV I did for her, but didn\u2019t say thank you, blocked me and then expects me to be her reference. \n\nAITA if I ignore the reference request because she ghosted me?\n\n\n*edit* I tried to call the recruiter on the email today but nobody answered. I followed up with an email asking them to contact me back. If they respond, I want to 1. Check that the request was genuine and 2. Check when she applied to make sure she\u2019s alive, I\u2019ll briefly explain the situation and my concern I\u2019ve not heard anything from her directly despite my attempts. If I hear back, I\u2019ll be sure to report here.\n\nI also emailed, messaged and called her again.

I was interning at a hospital in charge of updating the website (it was the early 2000s). Someone organized a photographer to come and get photos of the buildings. When he sent them, I didn't like them, and in my 22 year old stupidity, decided to just ignore the email.  The photographer followed up, I ignored and he escalated. I got my ass rightfully handed to me and learned an important lesson about professionalism and grace that I have never forgotten. You won't do her any favours by doing this reference, but neither will you by tanking her reference and never telling her. Your call - but I am very grateful for the way my ass was handed to me.", "NTA - but, I'd complete the questionnaire and be COMPLETELY honest with the answers. \"Reliable and trustworthy\" - Little Miss had me complete her CV to a legible standard, and then after I completed the work for her, she did not acknowledge or thank me for the 2 hours of work I put in.

If you want to mention anything negative my advise is just reply back with: \"I have no comment to make about <Person>.\"\n\nLeaving a negative refence opens you up for all kinds of legal problems if she ever finds out you gave a negative reference.

She\u2019s not work worthy.", "A lot of people use me as a reference because I own a business. I've noticed that they often ask me about the person's attitude as well as what they did in their jobs. I think you should fill in the questionnaire, but if there's a part that asks about the person's attitude or about them as a person, be honest about whats happened. \nI vote NTA but you would be TA if you didn't fill it in at all.", "I'd say NAH because it sounds like a misunderstanding, or a glitch, or something like that.

I'd suggest trying to get in touch with her (I assume you have her phone number). Just give her a call and ask her what happened and that you are little unsure what to do at this point.

Where do you think the wiggle room is here?\n\nYou've clearly done well for yourself and mentored this girl who also wants to do well.
