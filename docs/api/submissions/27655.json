Or just generally respond to your attempts to contact her? Not only that, she blocked you too. I think you've done more than enough for her.", "NTA but you might also answer the questionnaire honestly and fairly about her recent interaction with you. You did agree to be her reference.", "NTA\nThat was a dick move on her part, and you don't owe her a positive reference after her behavior. In my professional career, I prefer not to give any reference if it can't be 100% a good one.", "Answer the survey honestly\u2026.\n\nIf she\u2019s dumb enough to still list you as a reference then thats her problem.", "NTA, you are nice, you want to ignore it. I would make sure to write the \"best\" review possible to highlight her ethics \ud83e\udd23", "NTA. I'm sure you have experience with this. But I've found the best reference for a candidate you don't recommend is:\n\n\"I can confirm that Sarah worked for me between [date] and [date]. I am unable to make any other comment.\"\n\nIt speaks louder than just ignoring it, but also makes it clear you have nothing else positive to say. I will never understand why people think that personal behaviour doesn't affect professional references.", "NTA. I wouldn't ignore it. I'd reply with reasons NOT to hire her. She is TA.", "NTA - and I am remembering my own 22 year old misstep like this that taught me important lessons.  I was interning at a hospital in charge of updating the website (it was the early 2000s). Someone organized a photographer to come and get photos of the buildings. When he sent them, I didn't like them, and in my 22 year old stupidity, decided to just ignore the email.  The photographer followed up, I ignored and he escalated. I got my ass rightfully handed to me and learned an important lesson about professionalism and grace that I have never forgotten. You won't do her any favours by doing this reference, but neither will you by tanking her reference and never telling her. Your call - but I am very grateful for the way my ass was handed to me.", "NTA - but, I'd complete the questionnaire and be COMPLETELY honest with the answers. \"Reliable and trustworthy\" - Little Miss had me complete her CV to a legible standard, and then after I completed the work for her, she did not acknowledge or thank me for the 2 hours of work I put in. Then she cut off all contact with me after this fact.", "NTA either ignore it or explain her horrible attitude and that she won\u2019t be a good candidate.  You spent time helping her and then she can\u2019t have the decency or manners to say a simple thank you and on top of all that she blocks you. Don\u2019t feel bad for ignoring it. She\u2019s not the brightest if she thinks she can use you as a reference after all that.", "NTA. She presumed upon a previous connection to get a job. You offered to help and a 22 yo not even bothering to give you a decent CV to start with despite so many free online tools to help.  Then after you did all this great work and even found positions she might be good for she blocks you.  \n\n If you gave her a reference now with this additional information. on how she reacts in situations you would be harming your own reputation. \n\nIf you feel like telling her why, it might help her grow - but that's only if you want to waste effort on someone who BLOCKED YOU", "NTA, but please be wary, the advice of \"fill out the reference honestly\", whilst petty and satisfying, is not good.\n\nReferences are considered somewhat legal documented opinions. If you want to mention anything negative my advise is just reply back with: \"I have no comment to make about <Person>.\"\n\nLeaving a negative refence opens you up for all kinds of legal problems if she ever finds out you gave a negative reference. Especially if you are in Europe. Data protection, libel, slander... etc... \n\nGhosting is just the best option.", "NTA don\u2019t give a reference. She\u2019s not work worthy.", "A lot of people use me as a reference because I own a business. I've noticed that they often ask me about the person's attitude as well as what they did in their jobs. I think you should fill in the questionnaire, but if there's a part that asks about the person's attitude or about them as a person, be honest about whats happened. \nI vote NTA but you would be TA if you didn't fill it in at all.", "I'd say NAH because it sounds like a misunderstanding, or a glitch, or something like that. Maybe she never got the info from you, as you yourself suggested might be the case. Maybe your email went to spam. Maybe she texted you and forgot to hit send (I literally did this to a good friend just last week about some work I was trying to help her with). I'd suggest trying to get in touch with her (I assume you have her phone number). Just give her a call and ask her what happened and that you are little unsure what to do at this point. It seems odd that she would ghost you and then use you as a reference.", "[deleted]", "I'm really mixed about this.\n\nI've found that the people that I've gone out of my way to help have actually stabbed me in the back more times than I can count.  So I tend not to go out of my way anymore.  \n\nThat said, spending two hours on a resume and giving a decent review for isn't really going out of your way.  \n\nI'm going ESH on this one.  She should have better manners and she will learn that.  It will cost you nothing to write a review for her.", "YTA\n\nYou are being petty and putting your feelings above this girl's career. The other company probably offered her a better position and more money.\n\nYou get nothing from being annoyed and not helping her.", "She asked if she could put you down as a reference, you said \"yes\". Where do you think the wiggle room is here?\n\nYou've clearly done well for yourself and mentored this girl who also wants to do well.
