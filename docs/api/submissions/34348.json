We are not a couple. we live together and have a kid. We cohabitate for financial reasons. We are in the US so health insurance is something you have to buy. We have been on government insurance for years. Every year you have to reapply and give them proof of income. There is a time limit for when you can reapply.\n\nSince we live in the same house we all apply together but one adult could be approved and the other not based on income since we are not married. Our child's insurance would be attached to mine since I am the primary parent that handles most things child related. \n\nI checked online today to see the status of our renewal and saw we needed to provide our 8 weeks of previous check stubs. I got mine easily online and uploaded them. In my mind getting access to check stubs is simple and I've had to do it a ton of times in applying for apartments or to show proof of income for various things. It's a common ask.\n\nAfter I finished my documents I called child's dad and asked if he could send me his pay stubs. He straight up said \"No.\" I waited a moment for further explanation but when he said nothing else I said. \"No? You cant get your pay stubs? Its for proof of income for insurance but I guess if you cant you cant.\" He then said \" I cant do that I don't have access.\" I then said he should ask his dad about it since that's who he works for. his dad owns a legit business and he gets regular paychecks. he then says hell try and message his step mom and see if she can figure out how to get them. He sounded irritated that id even ask for this info and wasn't at all appreciative that I was taking this on (insurance business is the worst to deal with). I didn't have to help him out. I was just trying to be kind. Now I feel like why did I even bother trying? \n\nI texted him after we got off the phone and let him know id seen that his dad can also write a letter proving/confirming what he makes and his ours and that if he'd prefer he can go on the site himself and submit the information. I sent him the site link and even told him where to click to get to where he needs to submit the information. I reiterated that I am just trying to help. He just replied \"ill send it to you whenever they get it to me.\" Again no thanks or I appreciate it or even ill handle it myself. it just feels so entitled to me. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI want to now text him back and say \"Never mind! You handle your own shit and ill handle mine!\" But I am afraid that when I get home he'll treat me poorly or act like I'm selfish or needy or childish because I expect common curtesy. I'm scared that he'll talk down to me even though he always says he doesn't and its actually me who treats him poorly. I don't want to be afraid to speak up but I am.

He's got you trying to accommodate his moods and habits and feelings by way of manipulating and abusing you. Stop letting him. You are not selfish or needy or childish. You are a grown ass woman and a mother and you deserve courtesy. Why not tell him to handle his own shit? You need boundaries and you probably need to walk away from this asshole.

He can handle his own and unless he's being paid under the table he has access to his paycheck info.", "NTA\n\nYeah, big boy can handle his own insurance.  \n\nMy husband *loves* that I handle our taxes (and did long before I started doing it professionally) and all of the health insurance related stuff.  He manages a lot of the other stuff, too (most bills, the car insurance), but those two have always felt a little overwhelming to him.  So he's grateful that I've never been bothered by managing those.\n\nHe has never, *ever* balked at giving me information or documentation or acted like it was me in any way hassling him.  Because even if getting the info itself is a hassle, he knows it's a necessary thing that you just have to *do* as an adult.\n\nAnd he never talks down to me.  I'm not afraid of his reactions to simple day to day interactions and necessary tasks.  That's not what a relationship should look like.\n\nEdit:  I forgot by the end that you're not actually a couple.  Yeah, that's not what a roommate situation should look like either!  Also, would you be handling signing up for health insurance for any other roommate?  Stop doing that.  If he ends up uninsured 'cuz he won't bother to gather the documents they need, that's his problem.", "NTA but don't do any more of his work for him.

You tried to help, he didn\u2019t appreciate it.", "As long as his failure to provide this documentation won't negative impact you or your child, I think you need this to be something you drop.\n\nIt's okay to be annoyed by this but it sounds like there is a reason you aren't in a romantic relationship with him. You need to treat this like you helping any other friend- you've offered to help, you've provided the information, and now you need to let it be.\n\nIn a couple of days, you can let him know that your paperwork for health insurance is done so you are done with that process for the year but the links he has will work until date, and that you'll email him all this information so he can has it available and can handle it.\n\nAnd let it be. \n\nDon't waste your energy on this.\n\nNAH You can't help someone who doesn't want to be helped. You made the offer. He didn't accept. Will he be upset with it later? Possibly (probably) but that's on him. He isn't a toddler. You aren't his mother.\n\n\\[If you are concerned about how he'll respond when he realizes he doesn't have health insurance cuz he played a poor game of FAFO- that's a separate issue. But that's likely an ongoing on and not unique to this.\\]", "NTA- He's a grown adult who can get his own insurance. You are not his partner. He is the father of your child. Sending him the link and explaining how to do it is more than generous.", "NTA", "NTA. But why do you take this on? It's work, he doesn't appreciate it and he doesn't make it easy. Let him know that in future you won't be helping on this, if he wants to be part of the insurance, he should make a note to get you this information next year by (DATE). As for this year, let him know you're sending it on (date) with or without his information. If you don't have his information, you'll remove him from the application and submit without him. No reminders no nothing--give him the information, in writing if possible and bow out. Forever. He's a big boy and this is adulting 101. And in the future, don't be doing extra for people that they didn't ask for and then get mad because they are not grateful.

What are his responsibilities?   \nMaybe I just have a suspicious mind but he works for his father. You live together for financial reasons? He doesn't get paid enough to support himself? Or is it to avoid paying child support? You realize that there are all kinds of ways for them to be hiding money so that you can't claim it as income for child support, right?
