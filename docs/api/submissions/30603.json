I'm a SAHM and so is one of the other moms. Of the other other three, one works part-time and the other two full-time.\n\nOne of the moms that works full-time mentioned about how they had started to pay for a cleaner to come in every other week. They both work full-time and have two kids and were finding they couldn't keep up with all the chores.\n\nThe other SAHM was agreeing with her about finding it difficult to keep the house clean when her husband does only a few chores inside the house. She told us her husband's main jobs are cooking dinner, cleaning the bathrooms, and looking after the yard.\n\nIn my opinion that's a more than fair distribution of chores considering her husband works full-time. They have one child (10F) and no pets. I mentioned to her that it actually sounded pretty fair and that my husband has zero cleaning chores and mostly only cooks on the weekends if he wants.\n\nI told her as he works full-time to provide for our family, I consider it my job to do the majority of the household chores. This isn't gender related in my opinion, if we both worked I would agree about splitting chores equally or if I worked and he didn't I would be expecting him to do the majority of the housework. I have five children, the youngest two aren't in school and I'm a carer for my husband's grandmother yet still it's easy to set aside a couple hours a day for household chores.\n\nShe strongly disagreed with me and she thinks her husband should be doing more and told me couples should split housework equally. I told her that I think she's being ungrateful to her husband who allows her to be a SAHM even now their child is older. I asked her what she does all day if she expects him to do half the chores and that she just wants an excuse to be lazy.\n\nIn the end lunch was ruined, she called me anti-feminist and an asshole. Two of our friends took her side telling me off for judging her(?). Was I the asshole here?

Be more supportive of your friends if you want to keep them as friends.", "Ugh. Listening to this conversation would have made me want to rip my ears off. Is this what SAHMs talk about all the time? Chores and whether your husband is a deadbeat or not?\n\nYTA. She wanted to vent and you had to be holier than thou about it.", "YTA for calling out another mom. It\u2019s their family\u2019s choice how they choose to divide their chores; unless she specifically asked for your opinion on it, asking what she does all day and talking about the age of their child was rude. You sounded jealous and mean spirited.", "YTA. You absolutely are judging her. You're doing it right here in your post. \n\nI have been a SAHM and a working mom and I will always choose to be the working mom because staying home to raise kids is not for me.

Do you just not like her?", "YTA for several reasons but especially because you don't know how much of a mess her husband and child make. Each and every home has different needs in a literal sense. Every laundry machine operates differently, some people dirty more dishes than others, etc. I also find it very interesting that you haven't mentioned anything else that she does. Does she do volunteer work? Does she live far from grocery stores? Does she have depression/anxiety? You seem to be someone who's always dreamt of being a SAHM and finds that to be a woman's job. Has your friend always WANTED to be a SAHM or did her husband request that of her, and then refused to do anything like help the kid with homework? What does her daily schedule look like? If you don't even know, judging seems pretty rude. I see how you ruined that lunch.", "YTA. It's her house, her problems.

Would you like a cleaner, but since you can\u2019t get one thinks that she shouldn\u2019t have one either? If I can do it so can she? She could, but she doesn\u2019t have to. Does that upset you?

What the hell does she do all day? I retired two years ago, a bit early. My husband is going to retire in a few years. I took over everything for him but paying bills. When he's outside working on our large lot, I'm out there helping. When I worked full time, I made sure he had a good meal when he returned home. Somehow I managed to keep the house running as well. Yeah, the chick is lazy and you called her on it. Too bad ,too sad.", "I'm a sahm too, but my youngest kids are only one and 4. I'm pretty busy. But having one kid who's already 10 years old, and obviously is at school all day, how busy could she possibly be? When my older kids were that age, I had a lot more time for things. It sounds like her husband does his fair share. \n\nMaybe telling her this at a group lunch wasn't the best idea, but it came up, so I get why you said something.

You were having a debate and you expressed your opinion. \nNow you are a bit of an outlier with the amount you have taken on and can do it all with ease.  So it's true that most people would struggle to keep up with your workload.  However that does not diminish your right to an opinion.  \n\nYour friend could have just agreed to disagree,  as she clearly didn't have anything else to defend herself with.  Instead she pulled the \"this is what we all think,  you need to get in line\" card. The YTA voters are pulling the same thing.  This is what people do when they don't have anything to argue with.  Ignore them,  you have a right to an opinion.", "NTA. You called her out and she didn't like that. \n\nWhat else are people supposed to think when she doesn't even have her kid at home for half the day?

She is a SAHM & expects her husband to work fulltime, and do half the chores? She expects alot. It's ok to point out the obvious. That's not how that normally works. Wow that's just cray,cray.", "In my honest opinion. NTA.\nYou were just sharing your opinion..\nCall me old fashioned. But I don't expect my husband to do a thing around the house. He works hard. He pays the rent. He supports us. \nWhen he gets home, I sentence him straight to the couch, because the poor man has been on his feet all day, slaving away, there's emotional stress and the entire family's wellbeing is literally resting on his shoulders. \nI stay at home, homeschool my two kids, clean the house, do all the chores, minor repairs, make dinner, and so on,\nA lot of people will crucify me for this. Yes, being a SAHM is HARD, emotionally, physically, and mentally, and it absolutely never ends \nBut why is the husband's side never taken into consideration? \nWhat is she doing all day if her child is 10 and likely in school? There is ample time to get all the household chores done and have dinner cooked.\n\nIt seems horribly lazy, in my opinion, and people are just becoming more and more entitled and disrespectful of their marriage partners.\nFrom both sides of the spectrum. \n\nI grew up in a home where my dad worked full time. My mother was a SAHM. We had a cleaner. My dad cooked. He took us to school. He was responsible for everything, even the laundry and ironing. all the while my mother lay on the couch and watched TV.\nThat poor man was exhausted .", "NTA.

Expressing your opinion is fine. But don't tell someone to their face, unasked, that they are lazy... and then expect them not to be annoyed at you.

You don't know the ins and outs of what she does all day. \n\nMaybe your husband picks up after himself at least and hers doesn't, so she has to do extra stuff just to get back to baseline cleanliness. Maybe her daughter needs more help with homework or more one-on-one attention than your kids do and it's tiring. Hell, maybe she just finds it more difficult or stressful to clean and cook than you do for whatever reason. Or maybe she felt like venting with her friends to blow off some steam. Maybe she's depressed and things are harder for her right now. \n\nWhatever the case, it wasn't your place to say all that about a harmless comment.", "NTA.

Either way her husband seems to go along with it.", "NTA, your opinion and voice are valid, although suggesting someone wants an excuse to be lazy is kind of harsh for a lunch conversation.  It is very generous and commendable that you do all that and take care of your husband's grandmother.

It is kind of the standard model now for many families in the US.", "NTA, though subtly and discretion may not be your strong suits \u2026\n\nSAHMing is a privilege that not many get these days.

I handled kids, laundry, shopping and housework, he did handle yard work cause he is a gardener.  It worked for us.  Now that I am back ft we ALL have chores.  Sat is cleaning day, equally distributed, hubby handles groceries and kids alternate cooking with him every night.  I help clean up with kid not on cooking.
