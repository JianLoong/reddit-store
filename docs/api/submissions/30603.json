I'm a SAHM and so is one of the other moms. Of the other other three, one works part-time and the other two full-time.\n\nOne of the moms that works full-time mentioned about how they had started to pay for a cleaner to come in every other week. They both work full-time and have two kids and were finding they couldn't keep up with all the chores.\n\nThe other SAHM was agreeing with her about finding it difficult to keep the house clean when her husband does only a few chores inside the house. She told us her husband's main jobs are cooking dinner, cleaning the bathrooms, and looking after the yard.\n\nIn my opinion that's a more than fair distribution of chores considering her husband works full-time. They have one child (10F) and no pets. I mentioned to her that it actually sounded pretty fair and that my husband has zero cleaning chores and mostly only cooks on the weekends if he wants.\n\nI told her as he works full-time to provide for our family, I consider it my job to do the majority of the household chores. This isn't gender related in my opinion, if we both worked I would agree about splitting chores equally or if I worked and he didn't I would be expecting him to do the majority of the housework. I have five children, the youngest two aren't in school and I'm a carer for my husband's grandmother yet still it's easy to set aside a couple hours a day for household chores.\n\nShe strongly disagreed with me and she thinks her husband should be doing more and told me couples should split housework equally. I told her that I think she's being ungrateful to her husband who allows her to be a SAHM even now their child is older. I asked her what she does all day if she expects him to do half the chores and that she just wants an excuse to be lazy.\n\nIn the end lunch was ruined, she called me anti-feminist and an asshole.

You're doing it right here in your post. \n\nI have been a SAHM and a working mom and I will always choose to be the working mom because staying home to raise kids is not for me.

Every laundry machine operates differently, some people dirty more dishes than others, etc. I also find it very interesting that you haven't mentioned anything else that she does. Does she do volunteer work? Does she live far from grocery stores? Does she have depression/anxiety? You seem to be someone who's always dreamt of being a SAHM and finds that to be a woman's job. Has your friend always WANTED to be a SAHM or did her husband request that of her, and then refused to do anything like help the kid with homework? What does her daily schedule look like?

He pays the rent. He supports us. \nWhen he gets home, I sentence him straight to the couch, because the poor man has been on his feet all day, slaving away, there's emotional stress and the entire family's wellbeing is literally resting on his shoulders. \nI stay at home, homeschool my two kids, clean the house, do all the chores, minor repairs, make dinner, and so on,\nA lot of people will crucify me for this. Yes, being a SAHM is HARD, emotionally, physically, and mentally, and it absolutely never ends \nBut why is the husband's side never taken into consideration? \nWhat is she doing all day if her child is 10 and likely in school?

Either way her husband seems to go along with it.", "NTA, your opinion and voice are valid, although suggesting someone wants an excuse to be lazy is kind of harsh for a lunch conversation.  It is very generous and commendable that you do all that and take care of your husband's grandmother.

Dad did the \"heavy\" stuff -gardening and anything that required a lot of muscle.\n\nWhen my mother got very sick for a while, Dad picked up more housework, but I did most of it because he was now spending a lot of time caring for his very sick wife, and I was pretty invested in her recovery.\n\nWhen the kids were grown and she got a job they did split chores equally, and do now they're retired.\n\nWhat your friend and a lot of these people seem to be missing is that there is a finite amount of time in the day, and if a partner is coming home to chores every day after working, what they do not have time to do is be a parent.\n\nIn the evenings after work, my dad spent his time and attention on his children. On weekends, he'd do gardening and car stuff and other dad things, but he would also spend hours every day with his children.\n\nIt's selfish to expect that a partner financially supporting the family do otherwise. It robs the children of one of their parents.\n\nMy partner is pregnant. I'm a woman. I will be working again after my parental leave ends; she might not, I make enough money that she doesn't have to.

That's very sad. If the world were a better place wages would still be reasonable and it works be perfectly normal and affordable for one parent to stay home with the children.\n\nThis is not inherently gendered.

Shopping and errands don't happen every day, and school activities are after school, so on average after 2:30, same with homework. Man I would be ecstatic if my hubs could cook, he is terrible at it he really tries but is to impatient to cook. Weekly dustings and monthly deep cleans aren't bad either.\n\nI've got 3 kids, I'm a sahm with my youngest not at school yet. I can get all my dishes and and 2 loads of laundry done by noon. And while I'm waiting for those to finish I do other cleaning that needs to be done for the day. If I have errands/shopping I can get it done before the older 2 get home. I even have time in my day that I do most of the yard work. And once my youngest gets to school I will be getting a part time job, because there is no point staying at home twiddling my thumbs if the kids aren't there. The friend at best was just being whiny, at worst being a lazy entitled brat about it. And yeah she should be grateful her husband can make enough money for her to sit on her behind doing nothing at home, especially since her kid is in school and its not necessary for her to be home all the time. Oh yeah he also makes dinner and cleans the bathroom on top of working all day, taking on 2 of the biggest chores. Now a days most parents struggle because they don't make enough to be able to live in a single income home, but the second parent can't justify getting a job just to pay for child care. Trust me I've been in that position for years now. I find it disgraceful as a partner to be in that position and still complain about having to do the things at home when there is plenty of time in the day to do it.", "This is just reality for most families. Adding a second full time job, even with daycare, will always net more than the benefits of a SAHP from a purely financial standard.
