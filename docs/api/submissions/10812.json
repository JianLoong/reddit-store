She\u2019s been a terrific partner, through thick and thin, but she can be a little\u2026 ditzy. She sometimes is a bit forgetful, even with basic stuff like where she put her keys or jewelry. \n\nShe spent the night at my place last weekend, when she decided to try and be nice; before I woke up, she got up and did my laundry. It was a super sweet gesture by her, but she put the lights in with the darks, and now all of my white clothing is tinted darker. My dark clothing is also tinted lighter. I noticed it when I was with her later that night when we were coming back into my apartment. I looked at my laundry and realized what had happened.\n\nI was livid with her. She\u2019s ruined over $600 of clothes, I went through and did the math. When I realized what she did, I got a little too angry and yelled at her, asking her how she could\u2019ve possibly forgotten to separate the colors. Come on, we all learned that back in elementary school. She started crying and said she didn\u2019t mean to, but I told her that actions matter more than words. She left my apartment crying.\n\nThe day after I told her she had to replace everything she ruined. She was still really upset that I yelled at her. I told her I shouldn\u2019t have yelled, though she did ruin my property. She got upset again, and hung up on me. Now her friends are super upset with me, and Amber has been distant. I want a non-biased opinion.

YTA", "YTA \n1) your dark clothes did not get lighter- because if science \n2) I have been washing darks with lights for 43 years with no issue \n3) it was an accident \n4) you are an adult and don\u2019t need to raise your voice", "Info.... how did the lights get darker, and the darks get lighter?... im confused about how your washer works like that.", "Am I the only person that never once has separated my laundry and never had a single consequence? Sounds like propaganda from Big Detergent. How do dark clothes become tinted lighter ? YTA/ ESH depending on if these were super fancy dress clothes that obviously should be washed with care .", "LOL you've never done laundry in your life\n\n>My dark clothing is also tinted lighter. \n\nThat's not how that works...at all", "YTA. Your darks did not turn lighter nor are they ruined. Separate the clothes, put a color grabber & Oxy in with the light ones, and you\u2019re fine.\n\nYou talk about how wonderful she is and then you get this petty & nasty about it? You yelled at her for \u2018ruining your property\u2019 LOL Your clothes aren\u2019t ruined, but you demanding $600 reimbursement might have very well ruined something a lot more precious. \n\nI hope she takes this for the huge assed red flag it is and dumps you This would legit be the hill I\u2019d die on.", ">My dark clothing is also tinted lighter. \n\neh?", "YTA. I don't think the clothes are \"ruined\" just because the colours are a little off. But you might have ruined your relationship with a good partner because you're obsessing about material possessions and money. A good partner is priceless, you can buy new clothes.", "YTA. \n\nYour dark clothes are not tinted lighter by being in the wash with light clothes. If she did something else, like use bleach on them, then okay they are ruined, but then they wouldn't \"tinted\" lighter, they would have bleach stains. \n\nMost of the clothing that is tinted darker is probably still usable- undershirts, socks, underwear- they just won't be nice and shiny and white. \n\nSo I just first, doubt that she truly \"ruined\" $600 worth of clothing- aka making it unwearable. \n\nAnd sure, you have a right to be annoyed, but if you have an otherwise good relationship with her, is the $600 worth more than the relationship? She didn't do this on purpose, it was an accident, so you can be annoyed, you can even ask her to replace a few items that were really ruined/particularly important, you talk about laundry going forward, and you move on. \n\nIf you don't want to stay in a relationship, then sure, send her a bill for $600 and break up with her.", "Nope I call bs I haven't separated colors in 20 years no bleeding has happened. Dyes are clothes are more fail safe as is the soap.  YTA", "YTA. And yeah, that\u2019s not how it works, buddy. Light clothes do not lighten dark clothes. Sounds like you\u2019re trying to take advantage and get some new clothes. And stop yelling.", "YTA\n\nYour exaggerating light clothes don't make dark clothes lighter \n\nYou shouldn't yell at your partner and \" she has to pay for her mistake\"  dude if one load of clothes is 600 dollars then eithier you don't spend your money right OR you can afford nice things and can replace them", "Excuse me? How does 1 wash make the dark clothes bleed lighter unless she used bleach? \n\nYTA for yelling at her and double the YTA for lying.", "I call bs. Your dark clothes can't be tinted lighter by being with light clothes.", "YTA. Light clothing doesn\u2019t turn dark clothing light, so you seem to be a liar that is looking for outrage. Further, it is not acceptable for adults to yell at people - communicating to make others afraid is awful.", "YTA, but you\u2019re also a liar. Darker clothes would be completed unaffected by being mixed with whites. You yelled at another adult like they were a child. You are an asshole.", "YTA because I\u2019ve never heard of darks being tinted lighter (source: I owned two laundromats) and I\u2019m therefore doubting everything about your post.\n\nAnd yes, for yelling about an honest mistake. When she was actually trying to help.", "YTA - when I was a kid I was taught by my mom to have 2 separate piles;  whites & others. I did my laundry like this for 10-ish years.  After I got married my wife (SAHM) washed everything together.  All is well.\n\nThe only thing we do is when we buy something new that is dark (others/not white) we wash it separately a few times as new stuff is wont to bleed.", "YTA for your reaction.  No not everyone learns to separate lights from darks in elementary school.  I sure as hell didn't.   There are many adults who don't separate lights from darks.  She didn't deliberately try to ruin your clothes.  \n\nIf you want a fully functioning positive adult relationship, learn not to yell.  Also dark colors don't tint lighter.  That's BS.", "INFO: Just how new are these clothes? How many times have you washed them previously? I can understand light clothes getting dyed by new unwashed dark clothing, but if this stuff has been washed before, I doubt that the lights got darker. And  darks don't become lighter by being washed with lights. \n\nYTA for yelling at her and calculating the price. Used clothes don't retain their new price value either.", "Your Darks are tinted Lighter?  Umm that's not a thing... Unless she used Bleach but in that case your lights would not have been tinted dark. Your just being a AH", "YTA dude.\n\nYou sound like my mom. She went off the chain at me for not sorting laundry, saying everything was \"ruined\".  But you know what?   Next time I did laundry, she wasn't home.  She didn't get home until after the laundry was folded and put away.   She made a big deal about how I did it \"right\" that day - and never realized that I hadn't sorted it.", "YTA unless you guys are using laundry detergent from the 50's I doubt the color bled. Modern laundry detergent is made so that isn't an issue anymore. If your clothes are so precious to you then do your own laundry. \n\nHopefully she'll wash her hands of you and find someone who will respect her enough that they don't need to yell at her when they're upset.", "YTA. Unless she used bleach it is highly unlikely that your darker clothes became lighter because she mixed colors and whites. \n>\nReferring to her as \u201cditzy\u201d is misogynistic because I can guarantee you don\u2019t refer to your male friends as ditzy when they forget something or make a mistake. \n>\nYou recognize that you were \u201clivid\u201d and you agreed that you shouldn\u2019t have yelled at her, but you also double downed and excused your hotheaded behavior. \n>\nSounds like you need to grow up (I seriously can\u2019t believe you\u2019re in your 30s) and learn how to communicate without blowing up and losing your temper when something like this goes wrong.", "YTA. Seriously you sound unhinged and exhausting.", "YTA.  Vey much doubt the colors bled.   She did a nice thing and you were cruel.  Also, even if the clothes were damaged, they were used clothes at that point and not worth 600.", "YTA\n\nNo, not everyone separates lights and darks. And no, one wash will not completely fade your dark clothing - so I doubt that stuff is \"ruined.\"\n\nWash your light clothing with bleach or oxyclean or similar and see if you can solve the problem without rebuying things. Don't yell, that's just mean.", "Dude, YTA. \n\nI'm not even sure I believe this is real. I've accidentally thrown some lights in with my darks before, and unless you had a brand new red shirt in with a load of whites, I don't see how everything could be ruined.\n\nPeople make mistakes. She was only trying to do something kind and helpful for you. What's more important, your clothes or your relationship?", "YTA\n\nYour dark clothing is tinted lighter? That's not how mixing lights and colors works my dude.", "Ruined is a stretch.", "Haven\u2019t separated by colors in decades and nothing has ever happened, not a damn thing.", "YTA for this bullshit story. Modern clothes don't run the way that clothes used to. Yes outside chance they may on first wash but generally this is not the case. I've been washing clothes on my ownsome for 27 years and done light and darks together and never once had this happen.  Buy some Vanish and your whites will be white again...Also don't yell", "Your clothes aren't ruined. There are products especially made to take dye out. I've never heard of light clothes changing the color of dark clothes so can't help you there. YTA", "YTA darks don\u2019t get tinted light\ud83e\udd23 or fade in a single wash.", "YTA not everyone separates colors, all mine go in that the same time and guess what my white shirts are still white", "Do people still sort lights and darks?", "YTA. Get a grip. Your dark clothing is not tinted lighter because it was washed with whites.", "My guy.\n\nUnless you had brand new dark clothing in there, the dyes would NOT darken out the whites. They say so do colors and whites separate due to 1) use of bleach 2) temperature of water. Only time a dark dye bleeds onto a white is if it\u2019s brand new and hasn\u2019t been washed yet. Also, white clothes do NOT lighten dark clothing. That is the dumbest thought process I\u2019ve ever heard. Oy. YTA.", "YTA\n\nYou know what we also learn in elementary school? How to regulate our emotions and not yell at people. She made a mistake, she didn't deserve to be berated over some clothes.", "YTA and I have serious doubts about this story. The \"lightness\" of light clothing doesn't bleed onto darks to make them lighter, and if these clothes have been washed at least once or twice before, the dye really shouldn't bleed. Unhelpful helping is very frustrating, I get it, but a lot of people combine lights and darks without issue and I sincerely doubt your clothes are actually \"ruined.\" Your used clothes are also not genuinely worth $600 if you're being honest with yourself, and  you can demand she pay it (over a nice gesture!) all you want but I wouldn't expect the relationship to last through that.\n\nIs that what you want? Your relationship to end over some clothes that probably look slightly different?", "YTA- just rewash the clothes with a color catcher sheet and call it a day. Apologize and don't expect her to help you out again.", "YTA. You\u2019re either lying, don\u2019t know how laundry works, or were looking for a reason to demean your girlfriend. Ex, I should say. Even if your \u201cdarks tinted lighter\u201d (?) you can fix any of this very easily. Nothing is ruined, you\u2019re just an awful boyfriend.", "INFO is it possible that you mean your dark clothes have some white lint on them?  Because white clothes don't have a white dye in them.", "\\>  My dark clothing is also tinted lighter.\n\nHonestly, you're probably just flat out wrong about both. But yes, YTA for yelling instead of having a discussion. Learn to use your words like an adult rather than an elementary student who has no control over their emotions.", "YTA. And worn clothes are worth nothing, so if you once paid 600 for them they were worth maybe 60 before the washing.", "YTA. She was trying to do a nice thing. Fyi, lots of people never separate darks and lights-- today most dyes are colorfast so it's unnecessary. But most of all,   I highly doubt your darks got \"lighter\"-- how exactly would that happen? White clothes don't bleed white ink!!", "YTA. Have YOU ever done laundry? Cause if you had, you'd know that washing lights and darks together doesn't \"lighten\" the dark clothes.", "YTA.    \n\nUpsetting about the clothes, though none of them sound  \"ruined\".   ewww.... they're a bit faded....    \n\nYou were livid, you yelled at her, for trying to do something nice, and then decided to add up the severity of her terrible terrible mistake, and BILL her.     \n\n&#x200B;\n\ndude.", "YTA. You yelled at her. Then you did the math to figure out what it cost? Seriously?! The clothing is tinted, not absolutely ruined. Get over it. What's more important -- your clothing or your girlfriend?", "Dark clothes are tinted lighter? What? \n\nYou two have been dating for *years* and this is how you react to an innocent mistake? You yell at and berate her, do the calculations and demand money from her?\n\nI'm sure if you had reacted *reasonably* to some clothes being ruined she would have had the opportunity to react in a reasonable way and come up with solutions. But instead she is distancing herself from you and your abuse and I don't blame her.\n\nYou clearly care about your clothes more than her and you have made that abundantly clear through your actions. Thoughts and prayers to your shirts. YTA", "YTA\n\nYou say actions matter more than words. Her action:  She did your laundry as a favor for you. It was an accident. She was trying to be nice. Being overly angry twice will discourage her from ever doing anything nice for you again. \n\nYou shouldn\u2019t have yelled, especially when she was apologizing. An as a 32 year old guy, you should be able to afford to replace it yourself, and not demand she does. It\u2019s not worth $600 used..", "YTA. Big time. Be a damn man about this. Don't count up the 'damage'. It's a mistake, clearly she feels awful, and you're whining at her like a toddler, making the whole thing that much worse.", "She washed lights with darks, and you\u2019ve used the words \u2018livid\u2019, \u2018ruined\u2019, \u2018a little too angry\u2019 and \u2018yelled\u2019.\n\nHer apology should have been the end of this but you\u2019ve taken the \u2018that escalated quickly\u2019 meme to heart. If actions speak louder than words, you need to be aware of what your angry actions have done here.\n\nYTA", "This is weird. Most dyes these days don\u2019t bleed. I throw everything except undies and towels into one load and never have a problem. Were the clothes wool? They must have been to cost that much, that\u2019s an outrageous price for one load of laundry.", "If you\u2019re comfortable calling a person that you\u2019re dating a \u201clittle ditzy\u201d then you are the absolute asshole, whether they messed up or not.", "YTA. You made this up in your head. I love my clothes but don\u2019t always perfectly separate them if they aren\u2019t new items and I have NEVER seen dark clothes get lighter from being washed with light clothes. That does not make any sense whatsoever, so clearly you are saw an opportunity to scam your girlfriend for new clothes. If I were your friend that what I would be thinking if you spun some sort of \u201cmy dark clothes got light from a mixed laundry load!!!\u201d like what utter bullshit.", "YTA. It\u2019s rarely justifiable to yell at someone. \u201cWashed the lights with the darks\u201d doesn\u2019t make the cut to get that explosively mad. Laundry mishaps happen to the best of us. Your reaction was scary.", "For what it\u2019s worth, I haven\u2019t separated lights and darks for decades, everything goes in the same load. Colorfast dyes and modern detergents plus cold water washes makes that much less necessary than it used to be. For sure there are some clothes that will bleed colors, but the vast majority don\u2019t, especially after a few washings.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I can certainly understand why the gf didnt separate the colors.", "YTA.  I know very few people who separate their laundry anymore.  And even if your white clothes have a darker tint to them, (your dark clothes definitely don't have a lighter tint to them - that's not how it works), she didn't ruin your clothes.  Are they shredded?  Are there bleach stains?  No?  Then you can still wear your clothes and they aren't ruined.  You thinking she should replace your clothes is laughable.", "yta\n  \nits called a mistake, people make them.", "YTA for yelling. She wanted to do something nice for you, she tried, she made a mistake. You then decided you needed to yell at her for making a mistake, as if you're perfect or something. Hopefully she has now seen you for who you really are and reevaluates if she wants to stay with someone so unhinged that he would YELL over some clothing.", "YTA. You yelled at and belittled your partner for making a mistake when she was trying to do something nice for you. You owe her an apology. This one is simple.", "Yta- we don't separate colors in my house. So if i did your laundry as a favor and you turned into Psycho Sam: screaming in my face, then demanding compensation.  You would not see me again and i that's best for everyone.", "I always wash all my clothes together. Literally never have had a problem. \nAlso, it's not a thing that dark clothes get \"lighter\" because they were washed with lighter color clothes. Ever. \n\nYTA for yelling at your gf like you are her parent", "YTA for how you reacted.  Everyone makes mistakes.", "YTA. \n\nAlso, your dark clothes are \"lighter\" from being washed with light colored clothing. That's asinine. \n\nTry re-washing your light colored clothes with a little bit of bleach, oxiclean, or borax, that may lighten up your \"ruined\" light clothes. \n\nFFS.", "I\u2019m forty years old.  I\u2019ve NEVER separated my lights and darks and I\u2019ve never had any issues\u2026", "I call bullshit. No freaking way did you truly go back and add up all the math of your clothes and in no way were they also \"tinted lighter\" that's not how it works.\n\nBut otherwise YTA and sound so insufferable. Wouldn't be surprised if she left you.", "YTA\n\nYears ago, when my wife was my gf, she shrunk about 60% of my work clothes.  They weren't very expensive, maybe $300, but I had to go clothes shopping, which I hate doing.\n\nI was angry, and I expressed that, but I didn't yell.  I had several times explained that I didn't want her doing my laundry because it would be easy to shrink it.  But I didn't yell because I love her more than some clothes.\n\nI suspect that you having anger issues that need addressing if this makes you get that angry.  You should probably seek therapy.", "YTA. She tried to do something nice and you yelled at her. \n\nFirst of all, I can\u2019t ever see a reason to yell at an SO unless they like cheated on you or something. Control your temper. \n\nAlso, geez it was an honest mistake and not a big deal. I\u2019m a grown man with nice clothes and guess what! I don\u2019t separate my lights and darks. My clothes are fine. Get over it.", "YTA\n\nWe also learn \"treat others as you would like to be treated\" in elementary school.", "YTA.\n\nBro, come on, it\u2019s goddamn clothing. Your significant other matters far more. I\u2019m noticing a pattern of disrespect here against her. \u201cShe\u2019s a little\u2026 ditzy\u201d? Bro come on that\u2019s such a horrible thing to say. You didn\u2019t even notice anything off about your clothes till the end of the night, and they\u2019re \u201cruined\u201d? You yelled at her and made her cry and you feel no remorse. Grow up", "YTA. Not okay to tell at her ever. Especially when she was trying to do something kind and a mistake was made. And when the heat of the moment was over you showed anger and resentment again instead of caring and compassion for someone you say you care about. Sounds like you have answer management issues.", "People make mistakes in relationships and it seems like you WAY overreacted. The clothes aren\u2019t even ruined? Just \u201ctinted\u201d whatever tf that even means. \n\n\nShe was trying to do a nice thing. I nor my husband separate our laundry and literally nothing had ever happened.", "You're an abusive liar, and hopefully she will leave you. Nobody needs a partner who screams at them for 'making dark clothes lighter' lol", "One: how much mf laundry did she do that it\u2019s $600 worth??? \n\nTwo: massive YTA. You YELLED at her because of some clothes? What is your reaction going to be like when she actually does something egregiously wrong? What is your reaction going to be in an argument? Red flags, seriously.", "YTA it\u2019s never okay to yell out of anger. Also you\u2019re lying.", "YTA for yelling at her and doing the math for it too. \nGo pick il some Rit colour remover and wash your lights lol \n\nAny dark colours should not have faded after one wash (if they did that is a problem with the fabric or your machine) unless she added bleach, which if your lights have changed, she did not. \n\nIt sounds like you\u2019re overreacting and, as actions speak louder than words, I hope your butt is single until you can learn to interact with people respectfully and control your anger.", "YTA. I don't personally know anyone under 50 who separates their clothes by color and somehow we all manage. Also, yelling is not an appropriate, healthy or loving way for an adult to communicate with their partner.", "YTA for yelling at her and doing the math so she could pay for your property. I've been washing my lights with my darks my whole life and have yet to ruin $600 worth of clothes by doing that. Amber has probably been distant because she's working on her exit strategy.", "YTA - rewash with a color catcher.", "YTA. It sounds like it was a genuine mistake and you flew off the handle at her. Separate lights and darks is not, in fact, something everyone learns in elementary school. Most adults I know don't even separate lights and darks, just whites and colors.", "YTA.  People are more important than possessions, you are an asshole.", "YTA they're clothes. This is the beginning of the end of this relationship.", "YTA. I wash all my clothes mixed and never have a problem.  You sound insufferable like my ex.", "YTA. Livid?  Over what is most likely some tinted underwear? Come on. \n\nAlso, white clothing doesn\u2019t lighten darker clothing. It could be some lint, but otherwise the only way that would have happened is if some bleach was included in the wash. But you know, if that happened, then the white clothes wouldn\u2019t be tinted darker. \ud83e\udd2d", "YTA, sort of. Wash in cold water, and the color bleed won\u2019t happen.", "Yta. They don't teach you think in school. You're parents teach you that stuff and it's possible that her parents didn't. I get that you're mad but please patient with her.", "YTA. This is not something you need to yell at her for. You could have easily laughed it off and told her how you do it. Not everyone in the world separate their clothes, and it's not like she burnt them.", "You\u2019re about to ruin a relationship with someone who tried to help you and make you happy?  Yeah, that\u2019s YTA territory.", "YTA\n\nThe only times you really need to separate lights/darks/colors/whites are the first several times you wash them.  After that, the vast majority of any loose dye is gone.  You can wash them all together once or twice and it won't matter a bit.  Your dark clothes don't need replaced as they are dark.  They wouldn't have faded or changed colors.  So, mainly, just your whites.  So your pricing is BS unless you had $600 worth of tighty whities.\n\nThose clothes that were washed, weren't worth $600 themselves.  As soon as you wore them, they are worth about 50cents on a rummage sale.  Now, I don't have a doubt that a new wardrobe you wish to replace them with is $600, but the old clothes are not worth anything.  I say that because you are washing them in a washer and dryer.  Expensive clothes go to dry cleaners and professionals, while dainties get hand washed.\n\nShe honestly wanted to help and you blew up on her.  Next time she wants to help, she'll remember that.  And if she makes another mistake and you blow up again?  She won't be helping you at all.  And then you'll wonder why she never does anything around the house to help.  And then you'll blame her for being lazy.\n\nAnd it'll be all your fault it turned out that way.", "YTA. Also I\u2019m almost 30 and have literally never separated lights from dark laundry with no issues.", "YTA. The clothes aren't ruined and there are things you can do to wash out the color bleed. Are you this abusive about other things, or just your laundry? I hope Amber wises up and dumps you.", "YTA: she made a mistake that is true, but you behaved like a verbally abusive boyfriend.", "YTA, don't yell. My 20 year anniversary is coming up and I can honestly say I've never yelled at my wife in anger.", "YTA. It doesn\u2019t sound like these clothes are \u201cruined\u201d simply because they color changed ever so slightly. Get a grip. If she had poured bleach on them or they got ripped or something that would be one thing, but the color changing a little bit does not constitute \u201cruined.\u201d \n\nYou overreacted to this situation and your gf absolutely does not owe you $600 for new clothes. AT MOST this situation was annoying and warranted a \u201chey, thank you for this nice gesture but I\u2019m kind of finicky about my clothes and prefer to separate the lights and darks.\u201d She didn\u2019t deserve to be screamed at to the point where she left your place crying. \n\nI do all the laundry in my household and never separate my darks from lights. Most people I know do not do this.

When you yell, you are almost always TA.  You can make the same point, often much more effectively, by using your normal voice.", "YTA. She was trying to do something nice for you. Also, light clothes cannot \"tint\" dark clothes lighter - laundry doesn't work that way. One wash shouldn't have darkened your lights appreciably, either. You owe her an apology - and she doesn't owe you a cent.", "YTA and demanding her to buy you a whole new set of clothes because they're slightly tinted makes you sound incredibly petty.

She\u2019s been a terrific partner, through thick and thin, but she can be a little\u2026 ditzy. She sometimes is a bit forgetful, even with basic stuff like where she put her keys or jewelry. \n\nShe spent the night at my place last weekend, when she decided to try and be nice; before I woke up, she got up and did my laundry. It was a super sweet gesture by her, but she put the lights in with the darks, and now all of my white clothing is tinted darker. My dark clothing is also tinted lighter. I noticed it when I was with her later that night when we were coming back into my apartment. I looked at my laundry and realized what had happened.\n\nI was livid with her. She\u2019s ruined over $600 of clothes, I went through and did the math. When I realized what she did, I got a little too angry and yelled at her, asking her how she could\u2019ve possibly forgotten to separate the colors. Come on, we all learned that back in elementary school. She started crying and said she didn\u2019t mean to, but I told her that actions matter more than words. She left my apartment crying.\n\nThe day after I told her she had to replace everything she ruined. She was still really upset that I yelled at her. I told her I shouldn\u2019t have yelled, though she did ruin my property. She got upset again, and hung up on me. Now her friends are super upset with me, and Amber has been distant.

In the interests of peacekeeping, maybe you could split it.  \n\nAs for separating colors, no a lot of people don't know or don't do it.  My strategy is all clothes are on a \"survival of the fittest\" program.  If they don't make it, we sadly part ways and I buy more of the stuff that can stand up to neglect.  So I would be a bad person to try to surprise you by washing your clothes.  You have to learn these things about each other as your relationship progressed.

Unless those clothes were brand new, never worn, tags still on them, they are no longer worth the price originally paid. Then, let's get into the fact that there was no malice or ill intent in the girlfriend's actions, which means if he were to take to say, small claims court, his case would be dismissed. Finally, there's the fact that light clothes don't bleed into dark clothes, only the other way around, and that bleeding from dark clothes usually only happens the first (and maybe second) time a new article of clothing is washed. Since we know these clothes were not new, since they had been worn and needed to be laundered, IF she owed him anything, it would be for the depreciated value and not the full cost (this is how insurance companies decide what they will pay when you make a claim with them for damaged or destroyed property). The depreciated value depends on how long he's owned the item, how many times it was worn, what condition the item is in, etc. There was no malice here and she was actually trying to do him a favor.

So, when I got my new bras I decided not to ruin them.\n\nMy gf has the blessing of having boobs that fit into the majority of sports bras, me not so much.  Small torso, huge boobs.  When I actually find bras that work for me I buy a ton (which is good as lulu just discontinued the Air Support bra).", "He invited her into his home and she was trying to do him a favor.

You were fine with her help when it convenienced you; you yelled at her when she didn't meet your expectations.

Can\u2019t wrap my head around that.", "Well, they can become lighter if they\u2019re washed in warm water instead if cold. I had the same thought when OP says they were \u201ctinted\u201d lighter. He means faded.", "Except he was appreciative until he realized she ruined his stuff, and again why would he make the assumption that she was going to randomly do his laundry when she doesn\u2019t live there. She didn\u2019t ask him she did it randomly then messed up his clothes", "Guess I'm a weirdo, I personally don't feel comfortable yelling at family (I'm sure that actually stems from the trauma I experienced growing up - abusive step parents make the kid grow up fearing/hating loud noises and avoidable conflict). \n\nBut no, I guess my most expensive bit of clothing is my wedding dress - which actually got a bit ruined at my wedding, because grass and stickers got caught in the bottom and made some tears. But I just don't care that much about clothes. I mean - it's just a bunch of cloth sewed into different shapes. Oh, and I never said I roll my eyes, I only do that after dealing with dunderheaded customers at my job lol.", "I don't yell at my family because I love them and have respect for them.

No.  So while it is possible, it does not mean she did in fact use hot water.", "I\u2019m the master of getting stains out, and yes if it\u2019s not crisp white is sucks, bleach/water soak is another option.

It is common enough that I get ahead of it every time now by saying to please not do those things for me as I am very particular. \n\nPeople who are not particular wash their lights and darks together all time with no issues. People who are not particular love to have chores done for them as a surprise. I\u2019m sure this girl washes her lights and darks together all the time.

The particular person has to be the one to advertise their particular-ness in order to avoid these things. The more average person, her, can\u2019t be expected to assume the partner is not average.", "It can absolutely do it with one wash. I get the impression a lot of people answering here have never owned nice clothing that requires special handling."]}
