I think she\u2019s just making excuses for blindsiding me.\n\nYes, a lot of people would think that 1 year is too soon to move in with a partner. And yes, living with a partner is *vastly* different than living with a friend. I understand your initial frustration since she did say she wanted to \u201cbe by herself\u201d, but she probably looked at everything and realized that having a roommate would make sense financially and wouldn\u2019t carry the commitment of moving in with you. That is a completely reasonable mindset to have. You need to let it go.", "YTA. You're dating, you aren't married. She has stated outright she's not ready to live with a boyfriend.\n\nYou can be hurt, you're entitled to your feelings but at the same time, do you really want to force something on her she isn't ready for?\n\nAlso, living with a friend is MASSIVELY DIFFERENT than living with a romantic partner.  It just is. That you don't get that is a little \"red flaggy\".", ">She said she\u2019s always lived at home and so she wants to \u201cbe by herself before deciding if she wanted to live with anyone else\u201d for a while \n\nYTA\n\nShe already answered you. Currently she wants her indipendence. And no, living with a roommate is anything like living with a partner. Roommates have no olbigations toward each other if not being civil, and usually have their own spaces inside the house.\n\nI understand you're hurt, but it seems that right now you and gf aren't on the same page about living together.", "Yta. A year isn't that long. She wants to experience some independence in her own place before she commits to living with a partner (and compromising on nearly everything) for potentially the rest of her life.", "YTA.   You asked, she said no.  Your pressuring her or making her feel bad about her very sensible (and mature) decision is an AH move on your part.", "YTA\n\nYou\u2019re attempting to emotionally manipulate someone into taking a romantic step they explicitly said they aren\u2019t ready for.\n\nAsking to move in when you weren\u2019t invited was already borderline.\n\nPretending to be \u201cblindsided\u201d that your girlfriend doesn\u2019t want you to move in, after she clearly communicated that, is ridiculous.\n\nYou are not entitled to live in your girlfriend\u2019s home!\n\nYou keep saying you were trying to \u201chelp?\u201d I don\u2019t buy that at all. Why are you so upset that she doesn\u2019t need your \u201chelp?\u201d", "YTA. That's great that you offered to move in. But she declined. There is definitely a difference between living with friends and living with a SO. And what if you two don't work out? And you still have to live together? Give her some time and space.", "YTA You can\u2019t expect her to be ready for something that she isn\u2019t ready for. This would be a good time to reevaluate your relationship. You seem to me moving at different emotional speeds. This could be a signal for you to end things. Or not. I was going to say No Assholes Here but you are at least somewhat financially motivated and finances are not a good reason to take such an important step in the relationship.", "YTA you and her have barley been together for a year. And you are automatically assuming she was going to ask you to move in.\n\nWith a roommate there is a normally a lease and contract  between roommates as chores and such. \n\nWith a boyfriend it's different what happens if you break up?  There are so many variables. That you are not seeing.", "YTA. I get that you are hurt, but your gf is not ready to move in with you, and you should respect that. Everyone moves at a different pace.", "YTA. So you basically invited yourself to move into her apartment, she clearly stated it is not the right time in your relationship and now you're hurt because she got a roommate that isn't you.", "YTA\n\nLiving with a partner is different than living with a roommate.  I would never let a partner move in with me unless we were serious, like considering marriage serious.", "YTA. She\u2019s not ready and let you know that.", "Yeah, YTA.\n\nIt's her apartment and her decision. She may not be as serious or want to take it to that level with you.", "Soft YTA, since you are cordial about it. Moving in with a boyfriend is a serious step in a relationship. If you moved in, you'd be a roommate she's sleeping with, not a boyfriend she's moving in with, if this makes sense. And that is a different dynamic altogether.", "YTA\n\nIt is a big step your girlfriend is not ready to take.  She is not making excuses because living with a roommate is completely different than living with a partner.", "YTA. Her apartment, her decisions. The end.", "YTA. She\u2019s not ready to live with a romantic partner and you\u2019re not entitled to move in just because you\u2019ve been dating.", "YTA. It\u2019s not about you and how it will \u201chelp\u201d both of you. She\u2019s not ready. She said no. You are allowed to be disappointed. You are NOT allowed to crush her \u201cno\u201d bc you don\u2019t like her answer. \n\nPS\u2026 that\u2019s a red flag and it will adversely affect your relationship. You cannot respect, love and admire someone and then treat them the opposite", "YTA. You\u2019re only upset because you were hoping to get a bill cut and have to spend less a month than you do right now. It was never about saving *her* money, but saving *you* money. And then you make it seem like she\u2019s ridiculous for not wanting to move in with you after only a year of being together. She doesn\u2019t move as fast as you and that\u2019s fine. And it *is* different living with a friend than it is living with a significant other. This coming from someone who has done both. Get over yourself", "YTA, why would you want to force someone to live with you if they don\u2019t want to? Get some therapy.", "YTA. Dude she simply wasn\u2019t ready to move in with you. You are acting entitled and frankly i wouldn\u2019t keep you as a boyfriend. Especially since you apparently don\u2019t understand the difference between living with a partner and living with a roommate. Also you didn\u2019t even suggest it to her. You said you should move in together. Like you made the decision and she should have gone along with it. That is controlling behavior", "YTA. Please dump her, for her sake. I genuinely cannot imagine feeling ENTITLED to taking that step together and if she feels it\u2019s early to move in together and you don\u2019t, maybe you aren\u2019t compatible anyway.", "Yta\n\n\nYou don't want to live with her because your at that step. You want to live with her to save money. For your own personal gain.\n\n\nShe telling you she doesn't want to live with someone most likely meant for a relationship. \n\n\n\nLeave her alone. It's her place. She found a way to make it work without you.", "She's not ready to live with you. Honestly, she shouldn't be ready to date you because you have a ton of growing up to do. YTA", "YTA. She did consider you but then decided against it for the very valid reasons she explained. The only problem here is that you can\u2019t respect her boundaries, nor can you take no as an answer. This is a YOU problem.", "A roommate and a partner are no where near the same thing. With a roommate she can come and go as she pleases, doesn't have to check in on purchases , no weird debate about the extra room or who is sleeping where and when, or anything else that might come with a partner. She may have just misspoke, not considering a roommate \"living\" with someone in the same way. \n\nShe's just leaving her parents house, she wants a little independence . That's a good thing, let her be without the guilt trip. how she wants to live isn't about you, it's about her. Instead of getting all in your feelings and lashing out, support her decision. \n\nI find it more upsetting that her parents are charging full market rate to their child just starting out.", "YTA. You can\u2019t speed up her timeline of your relationship. Moving in should happen when BOTH parties are ready. \n\nAnd she is 100% right - living with a roommate is completely different than living with a significant other.", "I feel like this is the case of miscommunication  \u201cbe by herself before deciding if she wants to live  with any one else\u201d\nIt can be interpreted as living alone entirely or\nnot living with someone your share interest with.\n And if she thinks it\u2019s too early , then it is too early for her. Everyone gets comfortable at different paces and you gotta accept that. \n\nAnyway soft yta for the way you reacted not for suggesting initially", "Yta, you're just mad that she isn't helping you save money and you can't live in the nice apartment", "YTA. You are just dating. She's smart not to let you move in this early.", "NAH. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re wrong for feeling hurt. But I also don\u2019t blame her for wanting space while going through a pretty big change. Me and my current partner moved in together probably too quickly. Especially since I had been on my own since I was 18 and she had always lived in dorms or at home. Obviously it worked out but it was a tough first year adjusting.", ">I said she should have at least considered me   \n>  \n>She said she thought we were too early in our relationship to live together.\n\nYTA because not sure how you type this out and still think she didn't consider you when you later say she did consider you and decided it was too soon.\n\nYou can be hurt but she has done nothing wrong. \n\nShe isn't ready for the two of you to live together.  \n\n\n>She said she thought we were too early in our relationship to live together (???) and living with a partner is different from living with a friend (???).\n\nA year is quiet soon to move in together.\n\nPlsu since you seem confused about how different it is between living with a friend and living with a partner shows you aren't ready to move in with someone you are dating as there is a large difference.", "NAH\n\nWhat you suggested makes financial sense - both saving money - nothing wrong with suggesting that.  And if your feelings were hurt - that's the truth; that's how you feel.\n\nBUT your GF is being very sensible.  She's never lived on her own before, having a woman roommate (for now) while she starts her job, and is dating you is very reasonable. She will be encountering a lot of changes as she starts working, this is a good way for her to get comfortable living as an employed adult handling the real world.  Look at it from her POV - that she's suddenly got a new living situation, starting a career, major bills to pay - adding 'move in with BF' may just be to much to add on top.\n\nAlso nowhere have you said 'We are madly in love and want to spend all the time we can together!\"  The way you described it was very pragmatic, but didn't seem to have the 'we love each other and are planning our future together' element. Maybe you're not there yet, and that's fine, but that means it's best to saving cohabitating until you two KNOW you are in love and in it for the long haul.   Living with a significant other comes with many more complicated issues than simply having a roommate.  \n\nYou can talk to her about how it hurt your feelings, but respect her decision.  She didn't say she doesn't care about you she's simply wanting to be patient.", "YTA.\n\nShe really needs time on her own, I think a lot of young ladies do...\n\nBut moving in together when she isn't ready would be the beginning of the end of your relationship.\n\nAlso consider what her parents probably think...", "NAH.\n\nShe didn't do anything wrong. Living with a partner *is* different than living with a friend because a roommate isn't someone you share a whole life with.\n\nI think it's okay to feel hurt, and I probably would also feel hurt in your position. But wanting different things doesn't make someone an asshole.", "NAH\nYou didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, she is right.  Living with a roommate is very different from living with a significant other or your family.  The only demands a roommate can place on you is being considerate when it comes to tidiness I of common areas, noise, and the like.   \n\nIt is a good idea to live alone or with a roommate for a while to learn how you like to live your life.  How much alone time is ideal?  Stay up late or get up early?  What is your messiness level?  Read or watch things to relax?  You can continue the list.  Those are all things worth figuring out before committing to a significant other.   Hang on to your wise girlfriend!", "NAH\n\nYou kept your hurt to yourself instead of putting on her, which is considerate and kind. She wants a taste of living on her own or isn't ready to move in together. Remember that everyone's view of \"too soon\" is subjective. My wife and I moved in together after a little under a year of dating and plenty of people told us it was too soon. \n\nLiving with a friend is what she wants to do and while you wanted her to live with you, she wasn't ready and you didn't stand in her way. No assholes here.", "YTA. Living with a partner vs. living with a friend are entirely different. She is not ready for you two to live together and you seem to just see the \u201clogical\u201d side of it that makes your rent less expensive. Living with a partner is a big step and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s not ready. You should respect that.", "YTA - you tried to help yourself not her lol.", "YTA, not for your feelings, but for the fact that you treated one of the biggest relationship milestones there is as a favor  and equivalent to having a lease with a friend. Especially since your girlfriend has never lived with anyone but family before.", "YTA.\n\nLiving with a roommate is incredibly different than living with a partner and offers a lot more independence. She can come and go as she pleases, she can buy and cook what she wants, she can decorate how she wants, the apartment is still her space and she really doesn\u2019t have to answer to anyone in her domain. She gets to build her own life there, regardless of the fact someone is living with her. The roommate is just that, a roommate that has probably signed a legal agreement and is paying half the rent and the half the utilities. Sure, they\u2019re friends but\u2026they\u2019re friends building two independent lives within a shared space. \n\nIf you moved in, even if you took the other room, it suddenly becomes your (the collective of you and her) space. The life she\u2019s building would suddenly be your (collective again) space. You\u2019d probably want a say in decore and want meals together. You\u2019d probably end up crashing in her room a lot of vice versa. You\u2019d be in her space ALL the time. That\u2019s not someone sharing rent, that\u2019s a whole other level of commitment. And if she\u2019s not there yet, you have to respect that.\n\n(To put this in simple terms, I live alone. My bathroom is pink. Shower curtain, bath mat, towels, all pink. Because it\u2019s my space and I love pink and no one else gets a say. Since your gf owns the space, even with a tenant, she gets to make the same call. One day if a boy moves in or I move in with one, I\u2019d compromise on my entirely pink bathroom because that\u2019s what you do when you live with someone. But right now it\u2019s just mine and it feels incredible and I LOVE my pink bathroom)", "ESH. Bro, you need you chill out acting like you're entitled to live with your GF right now after 1 year. You are dating, and living together is a huge step. My only gripe with her is that she was not upfront with you that she didn't want to move in with you. Her lying to you about wanting to live alone was not the right way to go about this. But don't pretend you were trying to move in with her as if saving her rent was your biggest priority. Honestly you acting hurt about this tells me your biggest priority here was your own convenience (see gf more often, pay less rent).\n\nMany people dating move in together out of convenience (like what you tried to do), but not everyone wants to rush into that when in a relationship. Your GF has a golden opportunity to live affordably in a nice apartment (because of her parents) with her own house rules. Living with a friend in a place you own is WAY different than living with your BF in a place you own.\n\nI know you hint that everything is water under the bridge right now with your GF but you might want to take things a step farther to clear the air since this is bugging you. You can easily freely tell her you were thinking more about this and understand it's her apartment, her space away from you, and her choice. Let her know that you understand why she wants to live separately. Otherwise you come off as entitled and controlling.", "NAH. Some people just aren\u2019t ready to move in as a couple, and there are differences between roommate and life partner. For some, starting to cook dinner for each other and do each other\u2019s laundry can be a quick way to feel that you\u2019re in a long term relationship without dealing with the emotions and whether you\u2019re committed for the long haul. \n\nI will say that you have some entitlement issues though. What gives you the right to expect first dibs on moving in. Have you even had the conversation around what your joint future will look like? If you haven\u2019t and assume this will do it, you\u2019re gonna need to ease into things.", "ESH - I understand you are hurt, but she has a point since moving in and finances are going to alter your relationship for sure. I do see how you found her way of denying you a bit offensive based on info provided, since she could have been a bit more genuine about it, but btw u arent an jerk since you just felt that she undermined you which is valid since ur in a relationship", "ESH\n\nYour girlfriend should have been upfront with you. But she obviously thinks yall aren't at the \"living together\" stage, so it would be foolish for you to bring it up. I'm sure if yall have a healthy relationship, she'll be ready to discuss it again in the future.", "NTA, I think if you threw a fit about it maybe, or if it was less than a year, or if she discussed her living w a roommate instead. But no, she said she wanted to live alone when she was having another girl move in without even talking to you about it?? That sounds hella sus and I would probably keep an eye on that.", "Yta", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I'm sure you're hurt because you like this girl so much but you're asking for something unrealistic. The one lesson I've learned is, unless you intend to spend a LONG time with them and they with you, and have a deep, profound relationship, it's best to have some distance from the person you're living with. If you guys aren't in the profound \"we're definitely on our way to getting married\" step, you should not live together yet.

You are rushing and it seems like it is for purely selfish reasons. She said no, and gave you a reason that is still valid.

What she wanted was a time period where her day-to-day doesn\u2019t really involve anyone else\u2019s opinion.

Neither of you did anything wrong and both of you are entitled to your feelings.

When you move in with a partner, that is a commitment in itself and a huge step forward in the relationship. You begin making decisions together, you adjust to each other; it\u2019s basically like the free trial of a person before you subscribe to them. Your gf is obviously not ready for that, and it\u2019s understandable that you would be hurt if you feel like you are ready. However, she has a right to her feelings and that is the reality of the situation. She also may feel like she wants to find her independence and learn herself and how she likes to live. Her individual routine, how she likes to cook, how she likes to decorate, all things she would have to compromise on if she moved in with a boyfriend. I moved in with my bf immediately after living at home, and while I regret nothing and love him and living with him, I always wonder what my daily life would be like if I lived alone/with friends and had the sole say in everything; what would my room look like, what would my routine be, etc. She might just need to find her individuality, in which case I would recommend being understanding and patient with her.

In fact, you and your place can be a temporary refuge for the times where your GF might want to be *away from that new living situation*, on occasion.

They might both be a 60, but for OP, 50 is serious enough to live together, for his gf, she might not be comfortable living with someone unless its a 70. I think a situation like this is too nuanced to say that she is objectively not as serious as him", "Thank you.", "She DID tell him she wanted to try living on her own a bit. If my partner had told me that, I'd know what they meant. If he misunderstood, that's on him. And no, 'if this was flipped\" the response would be no different. This other person is not ready to move in. That doesn't automatically make them a villain. The fact that their partner is trying to vilify them is a problem.\n\nETA: yes, it makes sense that OP might be a bit surprised that it happens this way so soon, but that's not an excuse to become angry and talk shit or call someone a liar. Their partner made it clear that they weren't ready for the step. It isn't about having a roommate. A partner moving in with you IS NOT a roommate.", "LOL it\u2019s not a race! She just finished grad school. \nI didn\u2019t move in with my boyfriend until 2 years together and we got married at 5 years together. Going on 11 years of marriage. Don\u2019t throw out the whole relationship because she needs a little more time. Marriage is for life.", "I'm sorry you feel the need to insult. By your logic she can live in her parents house, live in her bed and her bedroom, she can have her own food in the kitchen, she can decorate how she wants. She can be an independent adult.\n\nYou also called are claiming OP is the husband and it's his house the GF is moving into? Interesting development.", "This is a bot copy of another comment from farther down.  Downvote and report.  If you like the comment, upvote the original here:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zqvhst/aita_for_telling_my_girlfriend_she_shouldve_asked/j1051mf/", "Think about it this way: when people go off to college, they\u2019ll often say they\u2019re going to be \u201con their own\u201d for the first time, even though college students typically have a roommate. OP\u2019s girlfriend has been living with her parents until this point, so anything beyond that would fit into that \u201con her own\u201d category. \n\nIf she had already been living just with a roommate, then I\u2019d get your point. But going from living with parents to living with a friend is a step that would be considering being by herself.", "I really don't understand these people. Any other situation if you say you're going by yourself then that's what you mean! Going on vacation by yourself doesn't mean going with a friend.", "Its not a race, but its also not about wasting time either. Many people want to be married and have their family fully developed (as in multiple children) by the time they are 28, many people don't. If your looking for a serious commitment in a serious relationship, that often means your spending 3/4 weekends and multiple weekdays overnight at each other's places between the 6 month and the 1 year mark anyway, so moving in isn't a big leap. It all depends on what your looking for and how serious you are at it.", "Potential future husband, not current husband, obviously. If he wants to advance the relationship to moving in together, it's not unreasonable that they would continue to live together long into the future. Then she would have always lived with him after leaving her parents house, never independently. Or they could break up which brings a whole separate bunch of issues. \n\nBottom line... you're choosing to continue to misunderstand her meaning, which was made clear when a person who is not a romantic partner moved in.", "Exactly! Like I don't think the GF is out of line at all for saying it's not time! It's the *lying*. That's the difference here.", "Let this be flipped and it would be a whole different situation.", "What a condescending statement. Again, you simply do not interpret her saying she wanted to live \"by herself\" as meaning \"alone\". We both see this as clear, but in different ways. Agree to disagree.", "\"GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOAL!!!!!!!!!!!\u201c", "You also need somebody nearby who can hand you the poop knife.", "Well if OP could give the benefit of the doubt that she meant alone in the way I see it, he can stop feeling so hurt by it and start repairing the minor damage to the relationship this misunderstanding caused. \n\nOr he can call her a liar and sulk over his hurt feelings and hold onto his little nugget of resentment until what? She lets him move in instead? Or they break up?"]}
