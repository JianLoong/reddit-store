I have been a bit unhappy for a while and have tried talking to him a lot. It just doesn\u2019t go anywhere because he gets defensive. Its mostly about work. He works a lot, everyday from 8 am to 11 pm and also in weekends. I also work fulltime but normal hours. We have a dead bedroom and this + his working hours have made me very unhappy. When i talk to him about it he tells me  that he is not going to cut back on his hours and I just have to live with it. Otherwise go and find someone else.\n\nThis Friday he told me he was too tired to do anything at night, so i made plans to go watch a movie with my brother at my parents\u2019 house and sleep there. When i told my husband he initially said he wanted to join. I was happy and excited. After an hour he said he changed his mind and was too tired so wanted to go to bed. I said I understand and left him alone. It was abt 8 pm and I wanted to leave, but then I saw him still working. This pissed me off as he said he was too tired and wanted to go sleep. I didn\u2019t argue but i said \u201cI thought you wanted to sleep because were tired\u201d.  We got in abit of an argument. He didnt let me go with the car because he wanted to go to the hairdresses the next morning, so i took my bike (mind you it was raining, dark and very cold). He couldn\u2019t care less and didnt even ask if i hd arrived. He didnt contact me at all. \n\nSpend the night at my parents, came home the next night. When we went to bed we got into an argument and he kept talking to my like i was a child. At one point he straighout laughed at me and copied what i said in a silly voice. I snapped and emptied n water bottle on him. He is left for his parent\u2019s house and told me he doesnt love me. He hasnt loved me for a long time.

If you're not willing to have a relationship on the terms that someone offers then the worst thing you can do is stay and just be difficult to punish them for not giving you what you want.\n\n>  I snapped and emptied n water bottle on him. \n\nThis is assault.", "NTA\n\nTime to rethink your marriage.
