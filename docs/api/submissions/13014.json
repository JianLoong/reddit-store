Your mom sounds exhausting.", "huge NTA. Setting boundaries with moms seem to be one of the hardest things to do. I got (and continue to get) a lot of grief for telling my mother she can't talk to me about her reality TV stars. It's completely reasonable to not want to hear shit about people neither of you know personally. If it was information you wanted, you could follow all the news just like she does.", "NTA. You\u2019re better than me. I always say until they (celebs) pay me to care, I don\u2019t care about them. They don\u2019t know you exist, so they don\u2019t matter. Your mother has a lot of free time.", "NTA. \n\nIf you want to be justifiably petty, start your own family group chat and watch as they migrate over as they get sick of the drama too.", "NTA\n\nYour mother may be trying to connect with you by discussing with you something that interests her.  That alone is okay, and it is okay that it is not an interest that you share, but by continuing to push the topic when you have made it clear that it does not interest you your mother crossed a boundary.  She then went petty by removing you from the family group chat, which sends the message that the family group chat is her personal gossip network.\n\nYour mother should take a step back and redirect her interest into a group that is more open to that discussion, such as a Facebook group, and keep it out of a family group chat that is, presumably, for discussing family matters.", "NTA", "NTA.

Mom and I just don't agree that celebrity news is family news lol!  So please keep me in the loop, and maybe the original group chat can be used for celebrity gossip.\"  NTA", "NTA. My mom and I used to get into squabbles like this. The best way I found to handle it was to just ignore it. Text her in another, separate conversation if you need to talk to her. I\u2019m sure you aren\u2019t the only person annoyed by it.", "NTA\n\nSounds like a win:win; you won't have to hear about the drama between two people none of you know and she doesn't have to waste her time trying to engage you in something you're not interested in.\n\nI see no downside here.", "Start your own group chat and leave her out.

That way you don't have to hear about her celebrity gossip but still can talk to everyone in your family.", "NTA.  It's okay for your mom to have interests you don't share.  The problem here is, she is interested in gossiping with you about it.  If you were just as excited, cool beans.  Knock yourselves out.  But you hate it, and your mom won't accept that.  Tried to force you to participate and punished you when you refused.  That's not healthy.\n\nMom needs to find a Facebook group or some such to get her gossip freak on, and apologize to you for trying to herd you into a \"hobby\" you find annoying.", "NTA. How childish of her.", "NTA - can she not get this out of her system on like blind item forums or comment sections? There is no shortage of people online who are as into this bullshit as she is, maybe direct her towards them. My mom used to  message me constantly about distant family drama of relatives I\u2019ve literally never met, and finally I said \u201cstop telling me about this I don\u2019t care, they\u2019re not people I know.\u201d  Parents can handle being told No", "Based on the title, I was thinking that you might be the A-H, because it sounded like you might have been belittling her hobby or interests. While I, like you, don't keep up with celebrities, I don't put down what other people are interested in.  \n\nHowever, it sounds like your mother is trying to force her interests on you, which is not okay.  I hope she shows as much interest in your life as she does in the lives of those that grace the silver screen.  NTA", "How much less could you care? Just trying to establish how much you do care.", "ESH - it's pretty petty both ways. This is clearly an interest area for your mom, and it wouldn't kill you to humor her. What people don't tend to realize when others do this is that they're trying to connect with you. Could she go about it in a way that's more interesting for both of you? Sure, but most parents aren't as clued in as we would like them to be. She's not doing this with malice, and telling anyone that you don't want to hear them talk about their interests will cause hurt feelings. \n\nAt the same time, I think she's over-reacting by taking you out of the group chat and icing you out. It would be nice if she took the hint to lay off it a bit or find a friend who is as interested in it as she is.", "You can\u2019t see me but I\u2019m aggressively rolling my eyes. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t hurt you at all to hear about celebrity drama, I understand you think you\u2019re above it all, but there\u2019s a fine line between \u201cI don\u2019t care\u201d and \u201cI don\u2019t care, and if you do, you\u2019re dumb.\u201d The latter is the energy you have and you should work on that. Enjoying celebrity drama doesn\u2019t make a person less worthy of respect than you, it\u2019s just a bit of fun. \n\nIt\u2019s fine to not care, but you became an asshole when you lashed out at someone for wanting to talk about it. Why does it make you so irritated? If you think it\u2019s cool to tell people to shut up about their interests because it\u2019s not interesting to you, you\u2019re going to have an incredibly lonely life. \n\nYou\u2019re not better than your mother, and you shouldn\u2019t be rude to people like that. I\u2019m sure you wouldn\u2019t like it if your mom told you to stop talking about what you\u2019re interested in. YTA.", "Info what's the problem? Isn't it a good thing she isn't speaking to you?
