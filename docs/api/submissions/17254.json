I (25F) just got engaged. We haven\u2019t set a date yet but I\u2019ve already begun researching venues, themes, food, etc. My mom (58F) was very eager to help, so we set up a lunch date to start discussing things. The problem is that she spent almost the entire lunch talking smack about my dad (59M) and stepmom (56F). My parents had VERY messy divorce when I was a kid, and have been on bad terms ever since. My mom couldn\u2019t stand it when a few years later my dad remarried and my brother and I had another maternal figure in our lives, so there\u2019s just a lot of bad blood all around. I think all 3 parents have done things over the years that they shouldn\u2019t be proud of, but nothing to the point where I wouldn\u2019t want any of them there. \n\nI was brought up Jewish and had a bat mitzvah when I was 13, which is the last time the 3 of them where in the same room, to say it was a disaster would be an understatement. My mom can be VERY strong-willed and stubborn and she ended up getting drunk at my bat mitzvah and picking a huge fight with my stepmom. I couldn\u2019t even enjoy my party with my friends because the stress literally made me sick to my stomach. My relationship with my stepmom isn\u2019t amazing but she did a lot for me growing up and I would like for her to be at my wedding.\n\nMy mom started going off about how she\u2019s \u201cnot giving me away with my dad\u201d and i \u201cit should just be her giving me away.\u201d She started listing off reasons too why I shouldn\u2019t even invite my stepmom and I ended up cutting lunch short because I simply couldn\u2019t deal anymore with the negativity. It began weighing on me for a few days and I decided to nip things in the bud. I called my mom and told her she needs to put the conflict aside because it\u2019s not fair to me. She went off telling me that I should be sticking up for her and I shouldn\u2019t expect her to be civil with someone so horrible. I clapped back and told her I\u2019m not having a repeat of my bat mitzvah, this is about me and my fianc\u00e8 and NOBODY else and we deserve to have a happy, fun, and drama-free wedding. I explained that there will be plenty of people there and enough space that they don\u2019t need to interact, and my mom just kept arguing with me. I finally said \u201cif you are going to deliberately create problems then I don\u2019t even want you there. You need to be civil and that\u2019s final, let me know what you decide.\u201d then hung up.\nShe blew up my phone for almost an hour but I didn\u2019t have the energy to entertain it. My fianc\u00e8 doesn\u2019t have much imput, he says he just wants me to do what I think is best for everyone, a lot of my friends agree with my decision but many of my relatives are chewing me out for what I said. My mom is an amazing mom, she cares a lot but she can be very closed-minded and it makes her act irrational sometimes. My dad and stepmom were not the best emotional support growing up or even now but I can\u2019t picture not having them there.

Ask her what her decision is: Keep her mouth shut and come to the wedding or be uninvited? You set good boundaries, stand by them and make sure she knows those are the only two options. And congratulations!", "NTA- If your mom can\u2019t grasp the idea that it is your day, not hers, then she should be left out. Time to learn to be civil with people you don\u2019t like, or can\u2019t stand.", "NTA. Mother harbors a lot of anger and spite towards your dad and stepmom and has show that she doesn't care what the occasion is, she's going to show out and cause a scene. It would be selfish of her to make your special day about her and her problems with the others. You're not in the wrong.", "NTA if your wedding is somewhat far away, i\u2019d tell her that if she can\u2019t act right about it until then then she\u2019s uninvited. if she can\u2019t prove herself outside the wedding then she won\u2019t be able to in the wedding. i\u2019d still go out to eat every so often and bring up something you and stepmom/dad did to see if she has a reaction. \n\ndon\u2019t create stress for yourself, this is one of the most important days of your life. stress that to her. hope all goes well <3", "NTA.  Part of being a good parent is prioritizing your kid\u2019s wellbeing over your own bitterness (and that\u2019s true whether your kid is grown or not).  It\u2019s clear that your mother refuses to do that.  Her desire to fight is more important to her than your wedding going off nicely, and it is perfectly reasonable to say that that doesn\u2019t work for you.", "NTA. Your mother needs to get over herself and start behaving like an adult.", "NTA\n\nEither your mom cares enough about you and your wedding day and your wishes to zip her lip, or she doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s that simple.\n\nWell done, OP. I\u2019m sure it was difficult. Don\u2019t let anyone convince you your request was unreasonable. Your wedding day is about you and your fianc\u00e9, not your mom\u2019s bitterness about her ex and his wife.", "NTA - I think standing up to your mum like that is probably what she needed to here to give her a kick up the backside and realise she needs to pull it together for the sake of her daughter.  \n\nDid she ever know how upset you were following your Bat Mitzvah? Will this be news to her?  If so, maybe it will be a good idea to actually take some time to explain that a bit more, how much you remember about how you were feeling and what she did....it might give her a wake up call.\n\nAt the end of the day this is your special day, I think it's good that you said this now and not a few days before the wedding!", "NTA - I was in exactly the same situation and I withdrew the invite after tge self same conversation.  My university graduation and first wedding (I pretty much got married to escape her!) went exactly the same way as your Bat Mitzvah.\n\nI had been so stressed about it happening all over again that it was a massive relief to not have to think about it.\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t need to parent your parent into behaving like a rational adult on any day, never mind your wedding day.", "NTA.", "NTA", "NTA.\n\nYour mom is already trying to sabotage your wedding day with her self-absorbed drama. She needs to keep her mouth shut and let you have the wedding *you* want - it's *your* wedding, not hers!", "NTA. Actions have consequences. Your mom has no right to expect you to support her or stick up for her when she's being an AH and causing conflict.\n\nTwelve years of being overtly angry, hateful, and spiteful is enough. You don't need to tolerate that behavior any longer, especially on your wedding day.", "NTA\n\nThis is your day, not hers.  You get to have who you want at your wedding.  And every bride and groom deserve a drama free wedding.\n\nAt this point in time, I would be reluctant to tell her or anyone else of a date and reception place until the invitations are ready to be sent out.", "NTA. If I may ask, OP: did your stepmother meet your father once the divorce proceedings started and/or were finished? You stated your father and stepmother married a few years later. If she wasn\u2019t the reason they divorced, is your mother upset that your father is happy with someone else?\n\nEDIT: I would like to add that you should have all of the people who support you there. You are not in the wrong for wanting peace and support for a major life event!", "NTA but maybe not the smartest way to go about things. \n\nConsider asking your fiance, his groomsmen and your brother to be at the ready to toss your mom out if she doesn't behave. And let her know that this plan of action is in place. \n\nI would also consider limiting her to one glass of champagne for toasts. Tell momsy she's on probation. \n\nAnd get your fiance's full imput. This is his day as well.", "NTA. It's your mom's behavior that's disinviting her.  If she can't get over it, she can check out the pictures later on Facebook. \n\nProtip: hire security. Don't let her show up to cause a scene.", "NTA\n\nIts your day and sounds like she could ruin it.", "NTA. Tell your mother that if she can not be civil on one of the most important days of your life, she is proving to you and everyone else that she values her hatred for your stepmom more than she values her daughter. \n\nI would also tell her that she already ruined another important occasion, your bat mitzvah. If she ruins your wedding day too, she will never be invited to another important occasion in your life where you would otherwise invite both parents. \n\nYour mother has a choice to make. She does not get to dictate your relationship with your father's wife. She can choose to accept that graciously and get along, or she can continue to demand that you take sides and she can lose. \n\nThis is a hill to die on. Good luck!", "NTA. All guests *should* put their feuds aside during a wedding for the sake of the couple getting married. By making her demands, your mother was trying to make the wedding about you, instead of you and your fiancee, and trying to use it as a popularity contest that she could win. \n\nIt took a lot of courage to stand up to your mother like that and to say what you did, and you were correct to do so.", "NTA\n\nmy family has issues but we all agreed to be civil (as civil as possible anyway) when the whole family gets together for things like Christmas/thanksgiving. The  MAJORITY of the time everyone\u2019s civil ish with each other. \n\nMy cousins wedding was years ago and that was a major shit show. Long story but there was lots bad blood between people after that. It\u2019s cooled off a few years later though but that got ugly. \n \n\nYou know your family best. Consider the family dynamics and make that decision, but think about it carefully. You only get one wedding.", "NTA. They are adults and need to act like it. The fact that even has to be said shows where their priorities are. \n\nMy parents were always civil with each other but I remember my mom giving my grandma a talk before my high school graduation about how if she and my dad could be civil, grandma had to too. It was mom who dad hurt, not grandma and she needed to shut up about it for a single day. Grandma just stayed away and we had a fun day. If OPs mom can\u2019t behave for their child\u2019s wedding, they don\u2019t care enough to be there.", "NTA.  It\u2019s good to keep in mind that tough as this is now you\u2019re really setting the boundary for your whole marriage.  And you might want to sit Mom down and explain that to her if she\u2019ll listen.   Because what events do you want to celebrate in the future?  Dinner for your first anniversary, baby arrival, babies first birthday, Hanukah, your tenth anniversary, your kids bat-mitzvah or bar-mitzvah.  I know, many examples are 15, 20 years down the road. But if Mom gets to dictate Step-Mom\u2019s role in the wedding now she\u2019ll keep doing it for every future event you have.  So it\u2019s either hold firm right now or likely be part of some miserable holiday\u2019s and milestones later.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
