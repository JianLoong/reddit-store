{"id": 16211, "submission_id": "135l11w", "title": "AITA for screwing my chairs to my table to prevent people from moving the chairs in front of my doorway?", "selftext": "Background: picture a long narrow townhome with a combined living / dining, then stairs and a doorway to a kitchen behind. I have a rectangular dining table that can seat 6, but in the space seats 4; 2 chairs on each long side. If any chair is moved to the ends / head of the table it either blocks the stairs or the doorway to the kitchen. \n\nFor whatever reason, even though it\u2019s just myself (35F) and my children (13m \u201cmike\u201d) and (8f) mike always moves a chair to the end blocking the kitchen door. I have asked repeatedly he not do this. I can\u2019t get dinner to the table (we use this table for all our meals) without squishing myself against a the wall like a contortionist or waiting for him to get up and move. Repeat this 3x a meal at least 3x a day and you get the point of how annoying this is. Note: for large meals, I turn the table and get the extra chairs from the attic and for the 2-3x a month this happens it\u2019s no big deal. It\u2019s the every day occurrence that\u2019s an issue. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is my mother, grandma (old, F), does the Same. Exact. Thing. She comes over at least 4x a week for dinner. She is larger than mike, so squishing past is not an option, and I\u2019m left to crawl through the pass through from the stair landing into the kitchen because that takes less time than asking her to move and waiting for her to dramatically grunt and get up and push her chair in. \n\nHere\u2019s the question: last night, after taking care of 2 sick kids all week, I got their illness. But worse. I got hit with a 104.6 fever and fell asleep on the couch. At about 2am I woke up dying of thirst and while barely able to stand, I tried to make my way in the dark to the kitchen for water. I fell over the stupid chair, which was at the end of the table, again. I have literally begged every day for the past 3 years to stop putting the chair there. I had enough. \n\nI got out my screw gun. I screwed the legs of all 4 chairs to the coordinating legs of the table so they cannot be moved from the long sides of the table. It is now like a fixed fast food table with attached seats. Mike woke up and called grandma complaining and the two of them are telling me I\u2019m crazy and this is uncalled for and I am overreacting because I\u2019m sick. They are also mad that I hid the screw gun and mike can\u2019t move \u201chis chair where he wants\u201d I responded that it\u2019s my house, my table and chairs (which are old and since I\u2019m in construction I could fix the holes easily if I so chose). AITA?\n\nETA: I keep being asked / told to get new furniture. 1. The table / chairs DO fit the space if the chairs stay on the long sides of the table. It\u2019s a 6\u2019 table. Each person gets 3\u2019 of space if they just leave the chair alone. 2. Sitting in front of the door gives the worst \u201cview\u201d of all 4 sides, looking out the window at the roof of my 15 year old car and neighbors siding, so it\u2019s not a preference of some gorgeous picturesque landscape either.\n\nEdit: the word \u201cend\u201d to \u201cside\u201d because maybe that\u2019s why there was confusion over me needing a new table?", "created_utc": 1683033613, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/135l11w/aita_for_screwing_my_chairs_to_my_table_to/", "score": 223, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Grandma would probably endorse Mike going to school covered in BBQ sauce to teach me a lesson.", "I\u2019m just astounded OP has been bothering to squeeze past. I\u2019d be standing there loudly saying OKAY UP YA GET MOVE IT MOVE IT IF YOU DON\u2019T WANT TO JUMP UP THEN SIT WHERE YOU SHOULD GREAT NOW YOU\u2019RE FINALLY UP MOVE YOUR DAMN CHAIR TO WHERE IT SHOULD BE every. single. time. And grounding the kid from his devices for the night any time he doesn\u2019t jump his ass out of the chair before I\u2019ve had to even ask when I open the door. This whole situation is ridiculous, OP is putting up with way more rudeness than is acceptable.", "Musical chairs - blocking the door edition? Hahahaha.", "Picture this: the table legs are on the outer 4 corners. I took the front legs of the chairs and screwed them to the appropriate corner legs. There is 25\u201d if space between the two chairs to get in and out. It\u2019s perhaps slightly uncomfortable because you can\u2019t push the chairs in to lean on the back while eating, it\u2019s more like a picnic bench at this point.

It\u2019s very pretty. \n\nIf you sit on long side \u201cb\u201d you face the living room, which you can also see art, family photos, or the TV which sometimes will be on during meals. \n\nIf you sit on the short side blocking the stairs (the less annoying short side) you can look at the wall or the furniture with the glass wear and little collection items like vacation souvenirs \n\nIf you sit on the short side blocking the kitchen door you look at\u2026\u2026\u2026.\n\nA window. With no shade because we like sunlight and it faces the neighbors house so it\u2019s not a privacy issue. So you see the roof of my 15 year old car in the driveway and my neighbors siding. \n\nI don\u2019t get it.", "Thank you. I will truly take any judgement here. So thank you for actually reading my response and replying.", "Ok thanks. I\u2019m here for fair judgment and will take what I get. I wouldn\u2019t post and delete on purpose.", "Take the kitchen door off too.", "There is such a thing as being too nice. You don't have to shout and rage and threaten, but you do need to put your foot down. Especially with teenagers, it seems they're a lot like some dog breeds where they like to see how far they can go.\n\n\"I asked you not to and you did it anyway\" isn't \"absentmindedness\". It is plain disrespectful, especially if happens daily for years. Absentmindedness you will have to live with, but disrespect needs to be ironed out immediately.\n\nDisrespectful teens grow up to be asshole adults. \n\nAnd doors are not that expensive and not that hard to install. A fire ax and a hockey mask are also not budget breakers. Just saying.", "They could sit on the floor! My Grandma wouldn't let anyone who disrespected her furniture  sit on it. You either followed her rules or sat on the floor.", "It's time to tell your mother you will block her number if she keeps calling to pester you about this subject. Also, tell her she's not welcome to your table until she learns some manners.\n\nRegarding your son, if someday you decide to sunscreen the chairs, maybe you should go back to old times and tell him he will have to write 100 times: \"I will not move the chair\" every time you have to ask permission to go to the kitchen. He losses his access to electronics until he writes it. I bet he will learn quickly.", "Perhaps a pitcher of ice water then? Easy to clean up, yet unpleasant to get spilled on them when they cause you to trip by being in the way. Also cheap and not wasteful. Like, it's the natural consequence of their actions. \n\nDoes anyone else help with dinner and find this problematic? I am really concerned for you that the family is so disregarding of your very reasonable request. Is this common in your house?", "Tell 'Grandma' that she is GUEST in your home, not a resident, who can be denied entrance at any given time if she doesn't straighten the hell up!!", "Grandma needs to stop coming to dinner until she can respect your damn house rules.", "This cracked me up. I am (unfortunately) familiar with that level of absurdity from family so it felt a little too relatable. \ud83d\ude02", "Being stubborn for the sake of being stubborn. \n\nThe next step is to stop struggling to squeeze past them. Sigh, say you can\u2019t make it to the table with the food and just leave it in the kitchen.", "Sounds like the appeal to them is pissing you off like some sort of power play", "For sure. I've edited my response, btw.", "Having a closing door onto a cooking area is an important fire prevention step; might be a code requirement in their area, but even if it isn\u2019t, it\u2019s not sensible to let annoyance come before safety.", "Ohhhh. Can I chalboard paint the tabletop and make him write it there?!?!?!", "Yeah. That\u2019s what I think but I didn\u2019t want to say that in my post and sway the decision. It literally is the ugliest view. And it\u2019s less room to sit on that side because it\u2019s 27\u201d wide versus the 36\u201d each on the long side (72\u201d long table / 2 chairs). I just didn\u2019t know if permanently screwing the chairs where they belong was going too far.", "You know, now that you said that, it makes sense that having a closing door would be safer, but thinking about it, I don't believe I've ever been in a house with a closing kitchen door.  There have been doorways, of course, but none of them ever actually had a door.  Huh.", "Plenty of people have open concept homes/kitchens, i don\u2019t see how removing a door is any different.", "That might be true, might not. But the vast majority of houses/kitchens I\u2019ve ever been in have never had a closed door to the kitchen. Just seems like a major hindrance when trying to set a table every day like this family.", "I don\u2019t live in an area with a door requirement, but you are correct it\u2019s a good fire prevention measure and should be more common. \n\nTo clarify, I don\u2019t have a door, but a doorway. It\u2019s the size of a door and framed like where a door could go, and depending on how the door swung, even if they weren\u2019t blocking the door from opening, they would still be blocking whoever from walking through the open door.", "Yes, you should. ;) If he complains show him Bart doing it on the Simpsons.", "This whole time I thought you were saying you had screwed extra chairs to the short sides (pushed in enough so they didn't block the door) so no one else could put a chair there. But you're saying you screwed the chairs you want people to use, into the long sides of the table? NTA if the former, but ESH if the latter. I think setting it up so no one can adjust their chair if they're uncomfortable, and possibly blocking your larger mother from getting in and out of a chair at all, is going too far. I completely understand why this was infuriating, though.", "Yeah same, ve seen kitchens with those swinging half doors, but besides that, none.", "Yes? Open concept homes are indeed less safe in the event of a fire than homes with closed doors, all the more so if they are properly rated fire doors.", "I answered someone else with the below text but to your first thought: if I screwed chairs into both ends, pushed all the way in, then everyone would suffer because people sitting on the long ends would have their knees right up against the pushed in chairs. \n\nPicture this: the table legs are on the outer 4 corners.

Every single home I\u2019ve ever lived in, and every home of everyone I know, none have doors on the kitchen. So it can\u2019t be that big of a concern. \n\nI would think the door constantly being blocked/the tripping hazard would be a much larger safety concern, even from a fire Marshal\u2019s perspective.", "Yeah, in OP's case it sounds like this doorway is an accident waiting to happen / a more serious one than the incident in OP's post. I don't have a good sense for the layout of her house, but the room with the table probably also has a closing door that could serve that purpose for the 2 rooms together.\n\nI'm not the tidiest, most organized person but that doorway situation OP has going on would stress me the fuck out. I'm clumsy and while my house may be a bit cluttered the pathways to get around it are always 100% clear of obstacles."]}
