{"id": 16211, "submission_id": "135l11w", "title": "AITA for screwing my chairs to my table to prevent people from moving the chairs in front of my doorway?", "selftext": "Background: picture a long narrow townhome with a combined living / dining, then stairs and a doorway to a kitchen behind. I have a rectangular dining table that can seat 6, but in the space seats 4; 2 chairs on each long side. If any chair is moved to the ends / head of the table it either blocks the stairs or the doorway to the kitchen. \n\nFor whatever reason, even though it\u2019s just myself (35F) and my children (13m \u201cmike\u201d) and (8f) mike always moves a chair to the end blocking the kitchen door. I have asked repeatedly he not do this. I can\u2019t get dinner to the table (we use this table for all our meals) without squishing myself against a the wall like a contortionist or waiting for him to get up and move. Repeat this 3x a meal at least 3x a day and you get the point of how annoying this is. Note: for large meals, I turn the table and get the extra chairs from the attic and for the 2-3x a month this happens it\u2019s no big deal. It\u2019s the every day occurrence that\u2019s an issue. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is my mother, grandma (old, F), does the Same. Exact. Thing. She comes over at least 4x a week for dinner. She is larger than mike, so squishing past is not an option, and I\u2019m left to crawl through the pass through from the stair landing into the kitchen because that takes less time than asking her to move and waiting for her to dramatically grunt and get up and push her chair in. \n\nHere\u2019s the question: last night, after taking care of 2 sick kids all week, I got their illness. But worse. I got hit with a 104.6 fever and fell asleep on the couch. At about 2am I woke up dying of thirst and while barely able to stand, I tried to make my way in the dark to the kitchen for water. I fell over the stupid chair, which was at the end of the table, again. I have literally begged every day for the past 3 years to stop putting the chair there. I had enough. \n\nI got out my screw gun. I screwed the legs of all 4 chairs to the coordinating legs of the table so they cannot be moved from the long sides of the table. It is now like a fixed fast food table with attached seats. Mike woke up and called grandma complaining and the two of them are telling me I\u2019m crazy and this is uncalled for and I am overreacting because I\u2019m sick. They are also mad that I hid the screw gun and mike can\u2019t move \u201chis chair where he wants\u201d I responded that it\u2019s my house, my table and chairs (which are old and since I\u2019m in construction I could fix the holes easily if I so chose). AITA?\n\nETA: I keep being asked / told to get new furniture. 1. The table / chairs DO fit the space if the chairs stay on the long sides of the table. It\u2019s a 6\u2019 table. Each person gets 3\u2019 of space if they just leave the chair alone. 2. Sitting in front of the door gives the worst \u201cview\u201d of all 4 sides, looking out the window at the roof of my 15 year old car and neighbors siding, so it\u2019s not a preference of some gorgeous picturesque landscape either.\n\nEdit: the word \u201cend\u201d to \u201cside\u201d because maybe that\u2019s why there was confusion over me needing a new table?", "created_utc": 1683033613, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/135l11w/aita_for_screwing_my_chairs_to_my_table_to/", "score": 1918, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I just find this to be kind of a petty solution because your adolescent son left a chair in an inconvenient place.\n\nI'd also tone down the \"my house, my rules\" thing. Your children already know that without you saying it. And, I mean, do you want them to feel like it's their house too or do you want them to feel like they're guests staying in your house?

As I bet she likes free food and seeing her daughter and grandchildren, she should soon come around. \n\nAnd when it comes to your son just don't serve him food anymore. Get two plates one for you and one for your daughter, fill them with food in the kitchen and bring them to the table and eat. If son wants food, he has to get it himself from the kitchen. A 13 year old his old enough to do it, but it will for sure annoy him a lot and he likely will stop putting the chair where it doesn't belong even when you unscrew it. \n\nIf that doesn't help, punish him.
