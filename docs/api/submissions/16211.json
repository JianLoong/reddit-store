{"id": 16211, "submission_id": "135l11w", "title": "AITA for screwing my chairs to my table to prevent people from moving the chairs in front of my doorway?", "selftext": "Background: picture a long narrow townhome with a combined living / dining, then stairs and a doorway to a kitchen behind. I have a rectangular dining table that can seat 6, but in the space seats 4; 2 chairs on each long side. If any chair is moved to the ends / head of the table it either blocks the stairs or the doorway to the kitchen. \n\nFor whatever reason, even though it\u2019s just myself (35F) and my children (13m \u201cmike\u201d) and (8f) mike always moves a chair to the end blocking the kitchen door. I have asked repeatedly he not do this. I can\u2019t get dinner to the table (we use this table for all our meals) without squishing myself against a the wall like a contortionist or waiting for him to get up and move. Repeat this 3x a meal at least 3x a day and you get the point of how annoying this is. Note: for large meals, I turn the table and get the extra chairs from the attic and for the 2-3x a month this happens it\u2019s no big deal. It\u2019s the every day occurrence that\u2019s an issue. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is my mother, grandma (old, F), does the Same. Exact. Thing. She comes over at least 4x a week for dinner. She is larger than mike, so squishing past is not an option, and I\u2019m left to crawl through the pass through from the stair landing into the kitchen because that takes less time than asking her to move and waiting for her to dramatically grunt and get up and push her chair in. \n\nHere\u2019s the question: last night, after taking care of 2 sick kids all week, I got their illness. But worse. I got hit with a 104.6 fever and fell asleep on the couch. At about 2am I woke up dying of thirst and while barely able to stand, I tried to make my way in the dark to the kitchen for water. I fell over the stupid chair, which was at the end of the table, again. I have literally begged every day for the past 3 years to stop putting the chair there. I had enough. \n\nI got out my screw gun. I screwed the legs of all 4 chairs to the coordinating legs of the table so they cannot be moved from the long sides of the table. It is now like a fixed fast food table with attached seats. Mike woke up and called grandma complaining and the two of them are telling me I\u2019m crazy and this is uncalled for and I am overreacting because I\u2019m sick. They are also mad that I hid the screw gun and mike can\u2019t move \u201chis chair where he wants\u201d I responded that it\u2019s my house, my table and chairs (which are old and since I\u2019m in construction I could fix the holes easily if I so chose). AITA?\n\nETA: I keep being asked / told to get new furniture. 1. The table / chairs DO fit the space if the chairs stay on the long sides of the table. It\u2019s a 6\u2019 table. Each person gets 3\u2019 of space if they just leave the chair alone. 2. Sitting in front of the door gives the worst \u201cview\u201d of all 4 sides, looking out the window at the roof of my 15 year old car and neighbors siding, so it\u2019s not a preference of some gorgeous picturesque landscape either.\n\nEdit: the word \u201cend\u201d to \u201cside\u201d because maybe that\u2019s why there was confusion over me needing a new table?", "created_utc": 1683033613, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/135l11w/aita_for_screwing_my_chairs_to_my_table_to/", "score": 556, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I just find this to be kind of a petty solution because your adolescent son left a chair in an inconvenient place.\n\nI'd also tone down the \"my house, my rules\" thing. Your children already know that without you saying it. And, I mean, do you want them to feel like it's their house too or do you want them to feel like they're guests staying in your house?

I've been in quite a few houses in my 30+ years", "> Having a closing door onto a cooking area is an important fire prevention step; might be a code requirement in their area\n\nI have literally never seen that in my entire life. Not in real life, not even in popular media. I can't even imagine a door on a kitchen that isn't in a restaurant.", "or just have a fire extinguisher next to your exfil/egress route", "That is why i said \u201ctoo\u201d so no door, or chair blocking the way..", "truth! And you said it perfectly!", "WHAT?!? That is absolutely ridiculous. I think I just wouldn't have her over anymore. I know that's hard (been there, done that, without the dishwasher insanity, and it SUCKS) but it's just...too much.", "Why are you not banning her from your home? Frankly, I would take away devices or allowances or even take away the chair of your kids don\u2019t do their part. And absolutely don\u2019t allow your mom through the front door until she pays for the dishwashers that she\u2019s broken and gives a proper apology. And stops doing something so irresponsible. You are vastly underreacting, not overreacting", "That sounds so hard. Especially the shit with Grandma. Anytime you're having trouble drawing boundaries, remember that your children learn from watching you and you want them to not be walked all over.", "Grandma needs a big time out from your home until she can learn to display respect and maturity enough to deserve to be allowed back.", "And you still let her come over?!", "Grandma needs to be persona non grata if she cannot abide by the rules of your household and set a good example of responsible behavior for your children.", "I think we all see why Mike thinks it's okay to openly disrespect you. You're letting that woman set an example of walking all over you. Grandma needs a nice long timeout.", ">guess who has replaced 2 dishwashers level of disregarding.\n\nI hope the answer to that is \"Grandma\". Stop being a doormat!!!!!", "Using a dishwasher door as a step stool is mind boggling. My medium sized cat has stood on the open dishwasher door, and I was worried about the hinges. A full grown woman? That's just an awful idea on every level.", "I think it just fell really far out of fashion? My house was built in 1930 and has a full swinging door (like a restaurant kitchen) going into the dining room. Although for the purposes of fire safety, it doesn't matter anymore because the previous resident knocked out a second doorway leading into the hall which is just an arch, no door.", "My apartment has closing doors on the kitchen but I thought it was just so the kitchen could be closed off when company was here.", "I have one. I hate it.", "It comes in really handy in odd ways. When my dad had leukemia and was released from the hospital after his chemo, he couldn't stand the smell of food cooking. Fortunately there was not only a kitchen door but also one between the dining and living room, so between that and running a fan pointing out the window to air the kitchen smells, he was able to be present during mealtimes without barfing.", "Seriously? Fuck. That. Surely that means your whole house reeks of cooking smells. That's rank.", "Tell grandma she can sit on it and spin, that will be a reference she gets \ud83d\ude02 NTA you\u2019re hilarious", "Not only that, just think about how many kitchens you've seen in popular media over the years... have ANY of them EVER had a closing door?\n\nI think MAYBE the apartment where George ate the pastry off the top of the garbage in that one episode of Seinfeld had a door? But Jerry's kitchen sure didn't, nor any other others shown.", "Possibly this is just because American houses are made out of tissue paper and optimism so fire prevention is a bit like rearranging the deckchairs on the titanic? Every house I have lived in in my life has had a solid, closing door onto the kitchen. Hell, I\u2019m standing in a kitchen right now with two nice solid doors leading off it.", "Or both, since the goal of fire safety is \u201chave every possible advantage, because a house fire can and will ruin you life\u201d.", "This was an actual disagreement between grandma and I. I\u2019m in construction, and the dishwashers were free (functional, but being thrown out for a kitchen remodel). So when I told grandma to pay for them, she argued they were free. When I told her my time in installing new ones was not free, she asked to see in invoice of who exactly paid me to install new ones. So I bought her a step stool and she replied with \u201csee, that wasn\u2019t so hard, was it?\u201d", "Only if your cooking sucks. Grow up", "Funny enough, the only house I've ever lived in that had a closing door to the kitchen was also the only house I've ever been in that had a kitchen fire, and the door being closed didn't help at all because that's why it took us so long to notice the pan and wall were on fire.", "I will bet anything the interior kitchen door is not a heavy fire door. She should take it off.", "good plan, smokey!\n\nunless you're renting, I guess lol", "This blatant disrespect and entitlement has gone too far for too long.

This is *YOUR* house!! Stop being a doormat, put your foot down with the rules (whatever they may be) clearly state the consequences for breaking them, & most importantly, *FOLLOW THROUGH* \n\nThis kid is *THIRTEEN* & you're letting him throw fits & disrespect you like this?? (Dont even get me started on grandma, cuz we'd be throwing blows in the yard as I \"escorted\" her out of *MY* house) \n\nSeriously,  please stop raising an entitled brat. My grandfather was amazing, I never doubted his love or support for a second but he would have straight up backhanded me *THROUGH* the kitchen door opening after asking me *once* to stop being so disrespectful & in the way. Youre not doin your son any favors at all allowing him to act like this. The rest of the world will not be so kind as to ask for *THREE YEARS* for basic consideration. Ground his lil butt & dont allow further discussion on the chairs. Theyre *YOUR* chairs!! They go where *YOU* say! If he doesnt like it he can sit on the damn floor Good Lord.... \n\nWhy are you letting them walk all over you like this??", "Nah, you're going to get stale cooking smells. Something can smell lovely while you're cooking it but bad afterwards if the smell gets into soft furnishings. There used to be a chain called BHS that had restaurants in the clothing department, all the clothes smelt like sausage and bacon.", "That\u2019s more of a problem of leaving something on the heat and unattended than of the door.", "In the 50's and 60's one swinging door was absolutely popular."]}
