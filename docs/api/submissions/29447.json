Both of them were Marines, and so was I, so we just got along from the get-go. \n\nMy MIL lives in Cali, where I met my wife, and we live in Florida now. My wife is very close to her family, which is foreign to me. My family was never really close. My dad is a textbook covert narcissist and my mom always went with what he said, so because I wouldn't put up with his bs I was the black sheep for a while. \n\nMIL was always welcome over, and I even paid for her to fly here to surprise my wife once or twice. The only downfall is when she would come, she would stay for a month or two, but it never caused a problem, until last year.\r  \n\nIncident:\r  \nLast June was my oldest daughter's sweet 16 so my MIL came out in May, to help plan the party and as usual, stayed with us. We have a big enough house, but my wife's cousin is also staying with us while she goes to school, so it was a little cramped, to say the least. \n\nAnyway,  she cooked, cleaned, and helped out with groceries and even our laundry. It was great for the first couple of months, but then August rolled around and she became snippy, and her not-so-nice side started to show. She started complaining about little things and started moving things and rearranging things to suit her. We just brushed all that off. \n\nI started getting irritated when she and my wife kept bugging me about upgrading my TV. I bought a 55\" Vizio LED in 2009 when they first started becoming affordable, and it still works great. I'm a simple guy. My pride and joy, other than my daughters, is my 73 Jeep, which I restored on my own. Anyway, I finally just said to hell with it and let her do it. \n\nFast forward a few weeks and she came home from grocery shopping one day and immediately started on us. She said she texted my wife and daughter to open the garage for her, but my daughter wasn't home, and my wife's phone was on silent. We brushed it off and helped her bring the groceries in, then she saw a dish on the kitchen counter that was dirty and not put in the sink, and she started bitching about how our kids don't do enough, and we aren't raising them right. \n\nThat's when I lost it. She and I started on each other while my wife sat in the other room and didn't say a word. Her two 30+-year-old sons live with her, so I went off. My daughters are A and B honor students in high school and are already either working or playing sports all the time. Finally, I told her if she doesn't like how we live and raise them, she can get out and stay at a hotel. \n\nShe went to a hotel two days later, and I haven't heard from her since. I texted her on Christmas, New Year's, her birthday, and other times, just saying I love her and hope she's doing well. She hasn't responded once.

That seems like a normal thing to be annoyed by if you\u2019ve been doing all the housework!

That being said, you owe your MIL an apology for the way you handled everything and that\u2019s all you can do. If there are any other visits though set firm boundaries and time limits. No more 2-3 month visits. She absolutely overstepped so don\u2019t let that happen again.", "So she came and did everything around the house for your family. Maybe she got pissed she worked hard and the kids messed it up. Your kids should clean up after themselves. YTA.", "This falls somewhere between ESH and NAH. This is just a fairly common family conflict that comes about from poor communication. \n\nYou talked about several episodes in which you were frustrated by her behavior or attitude and \u201cbrushed it off\u201d or \u201cjust said \u2018to hell with it\u2019,\u201d and then eventually she pushed you too far, and you \u201clost it,\u201d with all of that built-up frustration and irritation bubbling up to the surface until you \u201cwent off.\u201d\n\nNow I\u2019m absolutely not saying that her behavior was acceptable. But I\u2019d be willing to bet that she did not realize just how much she was frustrating and irritating you during those early interactions. From her perspective, she had a single bad day, lashed out (granted, rudely and inappropriately) and in that moment suddenly you were jumping down her throat with no warning. \n\nThis dynamic happens all the time. In the future, I\u2019d highly recommend (with her, but also with everyone else in your life) that the *very first time* you are even moderately frustrated by someone\u2019s behavior or attitude, you address it with them, right then and there. Since you\u2019ll only be a little frustrated, you\u2019ll be able to keep your head better and keep the conversation constructive and civil. Never assume someone knows how poorly they are acting, even if it seems incredibly obvious to you. Everyone has different strengths and weaknesses and perspectives. When you are starting to feel upset by the way someone is treating you, let them know right away. Chances are, they didn\u2019t realize that they were upsetting you. \n\nYou\u2019ll be setting clear boundaries and expectations, and the person will know that you were bothered, and hopefully not continue to act that way. And if it happens again, do the same thing again. A hundred somewhat awkward \u201cfrustrated-but-civil\u201d conversations are infinitely better to months/years of built-up irritation suddenly bursting like a dam and going directly to DEFCON1.\n\nI guarantee this will improve your relationships with the people around you and lower the amount of stress you go through from bottling up your frustrations with various things people do.", "Cali Colombia?", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA.

I don't think you're TA OP, but you have a wife problem and probably should put a time limit on how long your MIL is allowed to stay (personally, I can't stand *any* visitors more than a few days, no matter how much I like them \ud83d\ude06)", "Lol here we go with the crayons \ud83e\udd23", "You could always crayon her an apology note for the way you handled the situation, and include the box of crayons with your teeth marks in them.", "Yeah I don\u2019t think she deserves brand-name at this point anyways.", "If the MIL drinks, there is also a crayon flavored craft beer that he could send her.", "MIL was out of line. She's allowed to have a bad day/bad moment (even as a guest, esp. a long-term guest), but it's her job to recognize she crossed some lines and apologize.\n\nI'm guessing that with the Marine backgrounds, you and ILs may be used to being in charge, things being dress-right-dress (don't know if I wrote that correctly). That still doesn't give her the right to go off on you for normal things while being a guest in your house.\n\nSure, you could have had a less strong response, but it wasn't outside the range of reactions you could expect people to have in the situation. You have reached out. You haven't apologized for your role. It is possible for her to have been wrong and been wrong first and for you to still be the first to apologize for your strong reaction. That might help, and continuing to send a text at times (as you have been doing) are about as far as I feel you should go to repair the relationship.\n\nThe other half is up to MIL. She should also apologize for overstepping her bounds. You may or may not ever get that, and it's up to you whether you can resume a relationship with her without that specific apology. At the very least, she can also respond to your overtures. If she doesn't, she's really dug in her heels - not your fault or in your control.\n\nBut you and your wife need to talk and agree on some things. #1: a time limit (if MIL ever resumes visiting) on MIL's stays. 4 months is way too long, esp. if you were a bit tight on space with another relative staying there, too. #2 Wife needs to agree with you that there's a limit to MILs freedom to critique/complain about how you two run your house. And agree on how to handle it if she does overstep. Maybe some other things as well.\n\nI'm sorry this blow-up happened in your family and hope you all can get past it.", "Too much familiarity breeds much contempt! You are an honorable  man, your wife is a coward . Not say anything to keep the peace and still keeps in touch. She should have said something . You did the right thing! A guest is a guest is a guest!", "ESH. She sounds like a pain but you could have handled it like an adult. Also why haven't you mentioned your wife's reaction to all this?", "YTA.\n\nSounds like you blew up over basically nothing, after enjoying having a free housekeeper and cook for a while. Maybe the apple didn't fall as far from the tree as you thought.", "I go up to my daughter's and sometimes I stay a month with her never have I bitched about anything I pick up what mess I've made I help with the dishes I help with cooking laundry my granddaughter she had no right to do that NTA", "NTA.", "You know what they say, guests and fish start smelling after three days! NTA! Live your life and raise your daughters.", "NTA. The MIL has issues with healthy boundaries, plus people-pleasing (doing all those chores for months) which can cause resentment and make people feel taken for granted. And I would argue that it's important for you and your wife to set some boundaries with the MIL in a respectful way. The TV thing crossed a big line. Who cares what kind of TV you have?\n\nYou have been kind by sending nice texts to the MIL. That is the mature thing to do. You could ask your wife how you think she could help smooth it over - ie should all 3 of you do a quick FaceTime call? You could ask your wife to tell the mother you both really appreciate her but she crossed some boundaries (such as A, B, C) and to please respect those boundaries going forward. \nHealthy boundaries are important for every kind of relationship. It's a lot to unpack here, more than I can cover in a comment. Hope it all works out.", "Info: I feel like A LOT is missing here. Your MIL came to help you and your wife plan your daughter\u2019s birthday party, so why was she doing the cooking, cleaning, and the laundry? What were you and your wife doing while she was taking care of all of the housework?  Is she a guest in your house or an unpaid housekeeper?  Did she just decide to do all of these things or is it just expected that she do them?  Her reaction sounds like burnout from doing everything for people who don\u2019t appreciate it.", "MIL \"Visits\" for four months? She must really be sick of living with her sons.", "NTA", "NTA - MIL has to learn don't dish it out if you cant take it.  She overstepped and forgot she is a guest in your home.  In retrospect it's time for MIL to go home.", "If she came out in May and was still there when August rolled around, we're talking about a 3-4 month visit, and at a point when your house is overcrowded. This was a recipe for disaster, my dude. It's one thing if you move an in-law in permanently. She would have her own space, and you would spell out what her role in the household is. In this case, your MIL was in this quasi-guest, quasi-helping out role that is poorly defined. It's her place to cook and do laundry, but she has to keep her mouth shut about your parenting decisions? You obviously have a line, but how does she know where it is? Then the little things she would've been able to brush off during a more normal length of visit (not being able to get in the garage on her own, a dirty dish on the counter) started to grate after 4 months. \n\nIt sounds like neither of you should have said what you said so I'm going to go ESH. Hopefully she can move on from this, as it sounds like you've had a good relationship up until this point. But for the love of God, next time set yourself up for success and don't invite her to stay for 3-4 months! 3-4 weeks is a REALLY long visit for most families. And speak up when you START to get frustrated (and are capable of doing so calmly). Don't bottle it up until you hit your breaking point.", "NTA but your wife is the issue here.", "NTA and stop sending her cards and telling her you love her.  Ignore her and just stay out of your wife\u2019s relationship with her.  You called her on her shit and that wasn\u2019t allowed.

There are boundaries. Parents do what they think is best for their kids. I honestly think you were more than gracious by allowing the rearranging and other not-so-friendly behaviors took place.

If she thought it was getting out of line, in the heat of the argument is when she should\u2019ve said something. I\u2019m going with NTA. MIL obviously wore out her welcome.", "I hate to tell you, but you have a wife problem. She's allowing her mother to try to run your household, and she's mad at you for putting your foot down and telling her no. I'd stop contacting her as you don't owe her an apology she owes you one. I'd also suggest couples counseling for you and your wife.", "It sounds like this is an important relationship to you. There have been many years of good relations and it\u2019s important to restore this.\n\nIt seems like your MIL does a lot for you guys when she stays that you obviously appreciate but I suspect she was starting to feel unappreciated perhaps even used, which triggered some passive aggressive behaviours in her.  Also throw in some \u2018cabin fever\u2019 it\u2019s tricky to live in close quarters with others for a long period of time without some cracks appearing.\nShowing recognition of all of the good MIL brings to your lives will help. Some loving, clear communication should solve this.\n\n\nI\u2019m thinking the way forward is to contact MIL via any method you feel comfortable doing saying that it saddens you that the relationship has been damaged and that you are sorry that you went off at her, in retrospect you should have handled it better, in a more respectful way. That you appreciate all of the good things she has brought to your lives.\n\nI\u2019m pretty sure everyone would like this situation to repair (and it\u2019s in everyone\u2019s best interests for this to occur), often all that is required is an olive branch to start the process.", "You both could have handled it better. You child have said something sooner instead of brushing it off and brushing it off until you threw her out with no warning.", "I approve this comment. I would upvote this 1000 times. Your wife is a coward!", "She let him deal he ause she didn't want to, so she could blame the \"overreaction\" on him and still get to have a relationship with her mom.", "Even then.. it\u2019s up to the wife to sort out their relationship. She should have told her mom that she had overstayed her welcome which OP was not readily in a position to do. And she could have helped diffuse the dirty plate situation. If you try to play Switzerland rather than helping resolve a conflict, this is what you get.", "Absolutely this! She should have handled it right when things started getting rough. OP has 2 problems, a MiL that thinks she is supposed to run his household when she's there, and a wife that sides with her and a tally at times joins forces with her to gang-up on him. This is not good.\n\nI would suggest marriage counseling to get the situation with his wife sorted and actually work towards presenting a united front when it comes to the household. I would also suggest having her deal with her mother going forward while clearly saying she is not welcome in the household until she can apologize for her behaviors last visit and set a clear limit of time she can stay if ever she does come back. Houseguests and fish have an expiration date, it's best not to have them around beyond that day.", "MIL is an ex-marine, it's a 'chain of command' thing in some military families.
