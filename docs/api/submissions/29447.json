Both of them were Marines, and so was I, so we just got along from the get-go. \n\nMy MIL lives in Cali, where I met my wife, and we live in Florida now. My wife is very close to her family, which is foreign to me. My family was never really close. My dad is a textbook covert narcissist and my mom always went with what he said, so because I wouldn't put up with his bs I was the black sheep for a while. \n\nMIL was always welcome over, and I even paid for her to fly here to surprise my wife once or twice. The only downfall is when she would come, she would stay for a month or two, but it never caused a problem, until last year.\r  \n\nIncident:\r  \nLast June was my oldest daughter's sweet 16 so my MIL came out in May, to help plan the party and as usual, stayed with us. We have a big enough house, but my wife's cousin is also staying with us while she goes to school, so it was a little cramped, to say the least. \n\nAnyway,  she cooked, cleaned, and helped out with groceries and even our laundry. It was great for the first couple of months, but then August rolled around and she became snippy, and her not-so-nice side started to show. She started complaining about little things and started moving things and rearranging things to suit her. We just brushed all that off. \n\nI started getting irritated when she and my wife kept bugging me about upgrading my TV. I bought a 55\" Vizio LED in 2009 when they first started becoming affordable, and it still works great. I'm a simple guy. My pride and joy, other than my daughters, is my 73 Jeep, which I restored on my own. Anyway, I finally just said to hell with it and let her do it. \n\nFast forward a few weeks and she came home from grocery shopping one day and immediately started on us. She said she texted my wife and daughter to open the garage for her, but my daughter wasn't home, and my wife's phone was on silent. We brushed it off and helped her bring the groceries in, then she saw a dish on the kitchen counter that was dirty and not put in the sink, and she started bitching about how our kids don't do enough, and we aren't raising them right. \n\nThat's when I lost it. She and I started on each other while my wife sat in the other room and didn't say a word. Her two 30+-year-old sons live with her, so I went off. My daughters are A and B honor students in high school and are already either working or playing sports all the time. Finally, I told her if she doesn't like how we live and raise them, she can get out and stay at a hotel. \n\nShe went to a hotel two days later, and I haven't heard from her since. I texted her on Christmas, New Year's, her birthday, and other times, just saying I love her and hope she's doing well. She hasn't responded once.

She probably feels you owe her an apology, which you don't (at least not unless she's willing to apologise too), and you have made the first step to patch things up several times. \n\nHow does your wife feel about the whole situation though? And is her mom still talking to her?", "NTA Once she criticizes the kids, I say let loose. The ball is now in her court to act like an adult or continue sulking. You did your part and can only control your own actions.", "NTA. She overstayed her welcome and her personal limit as to how long she can be \u201cnice on front of others\u201d line.  If she wants to hold a grudge for judging you, criticizing you in your own home than enjoy the silence!", "INFO: did you apologize for snapping (NOT talking about what you said because you weren't wrong for what you said, just the delivery was wrong) and kicking her out essentially? Or did you text her on Christmas, New Year's, her birthday, and other times and never apologized for what was said in your home? Like has that been addressed or are you texting as if nothing ever happened?", "ESH. \n\nThat you ignored X number of things that bugged you before you \u2018lost it\u2019 and ordered her out of the house points to unskillful adulting. \n\nWhich, given her now year-long reaction, seems to be an issue for her as well. \n\nFWIW, I am skeptical\u2014given the above\u2014that her coming and staying \u2018for a month or two\u2019 over 19 yrs. never caused a problem.", "You both seem like immature child frankly. You for snapping and her for months of silent treatment. But her months or years of pettiness is not your problem. NTA", "ESH, but you more. You escalated the situation immensely, and I\u2019m not sure you ever expressed appreciation for everything she did for you or sacrificed. She shouldn\u2019t have made the comment about your kids, but you are apparently throwing your kid didn\u2019t a big 16th birthday that it required mil to come to plan it for months, regardless of their grades, it\u2019s likely the bowl was the typing point and not a one off", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
