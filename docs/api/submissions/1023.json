I look almost entirely Middle Eastern. For as long as I can remember, family members on my mum's side would tease and make jokes about my appearance.\n\nGrowing up my nickname was \"brown guy\" in their language.\n\nWhen I was like 9 years old, my cousins and I came home after playing outside all day and I teased them for having tons of mosquito bites while I barely had any. My auntie overheard this and told me \"That's because the blood of brown people just doesn't taste as sweet\".\n\nMy mum was facetiming her cousins from overseas one time and asked me to talk to them. As soon as she passed me the phone they said \"What the hell is Osama Bin Laden doing here?\".\n\nThere were countless instances of shit like this happening throughout my childhood and it definitely caused a lot of insecurities about my appearance/heritage growing up.\n\nThree years ago my uncle on my mum's side held a large dinner party at his place with many family members attending, including some from overseas. We were all at a table eating when one of my aunts cracked the usual racist joke about me and EVERYONE started laughing. I genuinely don't remember what she said but for some reason this was the straw that broke that camel's back. I was at that age where I knew how wrong racism was and how I needed to stand up for myself. I legit exploded. I stood up and told them that I've endured their bullshit for my entire life and I've finally had enough. I said that I regret being born into such a stupid, uneducated family and that there wasn't a single adult in the family that I respected. The whole table went quiet and I demanded my mum to drive me home because I couldn't stand being around them any longer. My aunt tried to apologise and say it was just a joke but I stormed out the door.\n\nWhen I got home my mum told me she was extremely disappointed and embarrassed by what I did. Said I was overly serious over a harmless joke. She told me everyone in the family genuinely loves me and didn't wish me any harm at all. She went on to show me a photo album of my aunts and uncles holding me as baby and talked about how much they helped her get started in Australia. She said that although no one in the family got a proper university education, they all worked their asses off to come to Australia and give the next generation the opportunity to do so. At this point I was crying uncontrollably and felt extremely bad for what I said.\n\nThey've stopped the jokes ever since. AITA?\n\nAdditional context: \n\nEveryone on my mum's side speaks very limited English \n\nI can speak in the east asian language pretty well but nowhere near fluent enough to fully express myself so there's a bit of a language barrier\n\nMy parents split when I was young which is why my dad's out of the picture\n\nAnother reason why I said I didn't respect anyone in the family is because some of them have very controversial views on certain political issues that I'm not going to get into", "created_utc": 1667468242, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ykxgb5/aita_for_ruining_a_large_family_dinner_and/", "score": 2041, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She is trying to create a bridge between you and them and letting you know that (despite you being who you are) they still love you. They have watched you grown up and that they are family. She may have been embarrassed as to how you delivered your views and thoughts during the dinner as well. \n\nNow, the issue with that (and you can let her know) is that her reaction of disappointment and embarrassment disappointed you! You can 100 percent let her know that you can\u2019t believe that she, as your mom, can\u2019t see how you have hated to be dumped on and to be told racist jokes to your face. Tell her that at some point we have to set boundaries. She may not like how you set them, but you were quite fed up with it (which is excusable). While you may have grown up with your family, you don\u2019t agree with how they have treated you or how the culture you were raised in treats others who look different.\n\nAssuming you aren\u2019t cutting ties with your mom and family, you can tell her that you expect these boundaries to be respected and that this is the best way to show you love. That you love them, but the jokes about your person cannot continue to happen. \n \nIt is always hard to take a stand against things that are wrong and to educate others. This is what you are effectively doing. You are not alone.\n\nI am from a country where division still\nExists on what is \u201cgood hair\u201d and \u201cbad hair\u201d and your attractiveness is determined by this. \n\nOnce a family member said (not too long ago) in 2018: \u201cYou cannot ride in my car because of your hair.\u201d They were embarrassed that I was wearing it natural that day and were worried about being seen with me. \n\nI looked at them, laughed and defiantly said: \u201cThis is how my hair is today and I\u2019m not changing it.\u201d I got in the car and they have never brought up my hair again. They had to get over it. It caused them to accept. We can\u2019t change who we are\u2026 either they love and respect us no matter how we look, or they can be someone we don\u2019t associate with. \n\nKeep doing you! Continue setting boundaries and showing people that racism towards your person will not be accepted.", "This happened 3 years ago and you are still clearly impacted by it if you are posting it now.
