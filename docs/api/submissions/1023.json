I look almost entirely Middle Eastern. For as long as I can remember, family members on my mum's side would tease and make jokes about my appearance.\n\nGrowing up my nickname was \"brown guy\" in their language.\n\nWhen I was like 9 years old, my cousins and I came home after playing outside all day and I teased them for having tons of mosquito bites while I barely had any. My auntie overheard this and told me \"That's because the blood of brown people just doesn't taste as sweet\".\n\nMy mum was facetiming her cousins from overseas one time and asked me to talk to them. As soon as she passed me the phone they said \"What the hell is Osama Bin Laden doing here?\".\n\nThere were countless instances of shit like this happening throughout my childhood and it definitely caused a lot of insecurities about my appearance/heritage growing up.\n\nThree years ago my uncle on my mum's side held a large dinner party at his place with many family members attending, including some from overseas. We were all at a table eating when one of my aunts cracked the usual racist joke about me and EVERYONE started laughing. I genuinely don't remember what she said but for some reason this was the straw that broke that camel's back. I was at that age where I knew how wrong racism was and how I needed to stand up for myself. I legit exploded. I stood up and told them that I've endured their bullshit for my entire life and I've finally had enough. I said that I regret being born into such a stupid, uneducated family and that there wasn't a single adult in the family that I respected. The whole table went quiet and I demanded my mum to drive me home because I couldn't stand being around them any longer. My aunt tried to apologise and say it was just a joke but I stormed out the door.\n\nWhen I got home my mum told me she was extremely disappointed and embarrassed by what I did. Said I was overly serious over a harmless joke. She told me everyone in the family genuinely loves me and didn't wish me any harm at all. She went on to show me a photo album of my aunts and uncles holding me as baby and talked about how much they helped her get started in Australia. She said that although no one in the family got a proper university education, they all worked their asses off to come to Australia and give the next generation the opportunity to do so. At this point I was crying uncontrollably and felt extremely bad for what I said.\n\nThey've stopped the jokes ever since. AITA?\n\nAdditional context: \n\nEveryone on my mum's side speaks very limited English \n\nI can speak in the east asian language pretty well but nowhere near fluent enough to fully express myself so there's a bit of a language barrier\n\nMy parents split when I was young which is why my dad's out of the picture\n\nAnother reason why I said I didn't respect anyone in the family is because some of them have very controversial views on certain political issues that I'm not going to get into", "created_utc": 1667468242, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ykxgb5/aita_for_ruining_a_large_family_dinner_and/", "score": 282, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

A joke is only funny when it's funny for everyone, including the subject of the joke.", "NTA, racism is not a joke. It's sad that your mother cares more for her siblings that you. You should ask her why it was okay for them to disparage you based on race but not for you to hold a mirror to them? Your mother and the rest of your family are the RACIST assholes.", "NTA. They were racist, but at least they leaned from your outburst and stopped the jokes.", "NTA, the comments they have made to you are awful and I'm sorry you have had to endure it while your own mother idly sits by and laughs alongside them.", "NTA. Try and stop letting your guilt bother you. Jokes aren't funny if they seriously offend the subject. It's good that you exploded or they may have continued their ignorant behavior in perpetuity.

What you said needed to be said, because they were being racist and unkind.\n\nIt may be, as your mother says, that in practical ways they have been generous and supportive, and that at heart they are good people. The fact that the jokes have stopped maybe means they are genuinely embarrassed and have learned their lesson. In that case hopefully your relationship with them can now improve.

What I mean by this, is that I'd like to think that if you had sat down your mother, then some of your closer family, and had a heart-to-heart... That you might have been able to be heard without having the \"explosion\".\n\nThe hope with that would be that your mother understood. Then you could be with her, her on your side and advocating for you, when you talked to other family members. They get the message that their casual racism was not appropriate, and eventually the message gets out, possibly even just through social cues and the crap stops.\n\nOf course, that's my optimistic point of view. You got the message across, and you made sure that you were heard the first time.", "NTA\n\nIt wasn't harmless if it hurt you.", "NTA. Your family is tho. They don't know how a harmless lil joke could ruin someone's life. Your mom is an AH too since she doesn't even see what's wrong. Don't feel bad. Now they know.

This is bullshit that Asian parents try to you guilt you with as a cover for their racism / inadequacies. Why do you have to be grateful that your extended family suffered so much to give their kids and your mom a leg up? What does that have to do with the fact that they are racist towards you? I bet your mom was more mortified that you thought of them as uneducated rather than the fact that her family was racially abusing you, her kid.

I bet they sure as hell wouldn't think it was a \"harmless joke\" if they had to endure casual racist remarks about Asians for years.

They have stopped, so they clearly realise what they did was wrong.", "Nta. And you\u2019re mom is a crappy mom. She just gaslighted you so badly talking about how the family helped her move. So\u2026.. what was say to you as a child and even now is still racist no matter what the family did for her.

Of course what you said hurt them too but I think it was necessary to say these things to them at this point so they see how much their words hurt you. I think it is important to tell people when they are acting racist. It takes a lot of courage to stand up to your whole family so you should be really proud of yourself.", "NTA.  Racism is hurtful.  Your family should be the one place where you feel safe and accepted.  You called them out on their bad behavior and I hope it has stopped the comments permanently.\n\nNow your family knows how you feel.  Your mom shouldn't have guilted you into tears. She should have shut down the racism years and years ago.", "They speak very little English except for constant racist digs at you?

None of that excuses years of racist comments at your expense, what a toxic environment for you to grow up in.

I don't care If her family gift her a Million dollars, she should NEVER have alowed you being treated liked that.

Always remember that you standing for your yourself achieved exactly the result you wanted - they no longer comment on your skin color or race. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong for standing up for yourself."]}
