But if she didn't tell you she was going to sell it, she's a mega AH.", "ROFL! That is hilarious!  \n\n\nYeah, you don't owe her any explanation. She asked for it, you gave it - was nice of you, by the way. What a fool she is.\n\nNTA.", "I'm calling fake", "NTA. \n\nYou made no claims that they were real. You didn't gift it to her with any expectations (i.e. wasn't an anniversary present or anything). It was a cheap bauble on your desk and she wanted one. \n\nThis gal is an idiot. Did she honestly think that someone would just have valuable gems lying about?", "Unless you're a dragon, NTA. Now, if you ARE a dragon, then you're clearly one for having fake gems and letting someone just take one without an epic battle.", "NTA and do you seem so rich that you would just leave your valuable gems lying around on the desk? at least she has revealed her true colors.", "I stg I\u2019ve read this exact story before", "LOL!
