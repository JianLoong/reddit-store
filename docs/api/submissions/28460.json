She ain't it.", "NTA, She didn't ask and you didn't lie.\nIt is very weird that she asked for it and than sell it a few hours later.\nThe fact that she got angry about it is even weirder.", "Ummm what? She got made because she couldn't sell the \"gem\" she asked to take for free? This person is terrible and you should remove them from your life.", "NTA, as a matter of fact OP, i stress that you need to dump her. She asked for something of yours to sell it for her own benefit, who knows how far she will take this. You gotta get out fast, before she starts demanding expensive stuff from you just to sell it", "Need an update OP lmao hope you told her to go to hell for trying to be foul and seeing a chunk of change she could take from you knowing you love her and would be willing to share with her she only had herself in mind", "NTA.  Did she really think you would leave real gems just out in your desk.  And then she just asked for one in order to turn around and sell it?  Doesn\u2019t really seem like the sharpest tool in the shed.", "NTA. Ghost this chick NOW!!!", "Of course you're NTA but this is odd. What a red flag.", "NTA, her trying to immediately sell it does make her an asshole though.", "Absolutely not", "NTA", "NTA but are still dating this person.", "NTA. She didn't ask, so you didn't disclose.

WHAT!? They LIED to me!? Do you have ANY idea how much I paid for th-\"  \n\n\nAnd just hang up the phone. And block her. And move.   \n\n\nGL with that basement tier gold digger.", "RUN! NTA. \n\nShe\u2019s mad at you because she thought she was going to make money off of you and didn\u2019t. That is a character flaw that you should not ignore.", "Wtf? She doesn't like a very good person", "Brother your girlfriend literally just stole something from you to fucking pawn it. Near the end of my last relationship, I found out my girlfriend stole a bunch of rolls of quarters from me to buy drugs with. I figured this out later on, but she\u2019s a homeless meth addict now! Not saying you gf is doing the same but that\u2019s extremely fucked up and she\u2019s obviously really stupid for thinking they were real, and effectively stole money from you in her mind.", "gold digger", "Psycho behavior", "NTA - and her taking something and immediately trying to sell it is an absolutely BRIGHT RED FLAG.", "NTA\n\nRed flags galore......DUMP HER NOW!  She's using to get the money but she got upset with you for giving her a fake gem.  You didn't actually count on her to sell it.  Now you know what's she like......dump her NOW.", "NTA. \n\n>she tried to sell it and the buyer told her it was fake\n\nShe asked for one of your items, knowing you'd think she wanted it for sentimental purposes, and she really intended to sell it. \n\nBreak up with this person. She looks at you and sees dollar signs.", "Nta, your gf definitely is the asshole for asking for something from you and then turning around to sell it for profit. That\u2019s gross", "Uhh no NTA but she is. She asked for something of yours because she wanted to sell it. Maybe she should have been honest about why she wanted it. She\u2019s TA.", "You are NTA but she sure is.", "lol she thought she saw a come up \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "She sounds like she's dumb as hell", "She\u2019s the fucking asshole tryna sell that shit. RUN BROTHA RUN.\n\nWhat else can you give her bro? You got any real gold bars? Let her have those\u2026she\u2019ll uhhh definitely not sell them lmao. What\u2019s in your wallet got any 100s?", "wtf why was she selling ur stuff. nta.", "I would be offended if my GF sold a gift I gave her this fast.", "NTA also think hard about that relationship. She wanted something of yours just to try and sell it for some cash.", "Honesty is key in a relationship. YTA for not disclosing the gem's value earlier.", "NTA. \nUnless you stay with her. Then you're the biggest asshole.", "NTA.  If she thought you would have real gems out and on your desk as decoration, then she really doesn't understand anything about gems bc you would be setting yourself up to be robbed.", "NTA but your girlfriend is", "I think that it's already a red flag since she attempted to sell it...", "NTA. Leave the girl, take the gem.", "Bro, she tried to steal from you", "NTA. She should be your ex-gf", "Please get a new GF 0_o NTA", "rofl, i cant believe this is real.

Fucking run, man.", "This post must be fake", "Why would you ask for a gift, so you can sell it?", "Sell your girlfriend", "YTA because this is incel fanfiction.", "Why is she trying to sell your stuff?? This is not normal behavior. She's scamming you.", "If this really happened NTA. \n\nShe was an ass to herself for not telling you *why* she wanted one of your cheap, decorative \u201crocks.\u201d If she had been upfront about her intentions, she could\u2019ve saved you both the headache. \n\nEdit:\nIf it was me, I would\u2019ve asked if they were real instead of assuming they were.", "no but she\u2019s dumb 0-0", "Even if it had been real who asks someone for a gemstone just to sell it to someone else? Maybe I'm biased for shiny, pretty rocks, but I would have treasured it and kept it for myself. NTA.", "No, but get rid of that girl, she\u2019s a moron.", "NTA, but your girlfriend kind of is for trying to sell it.", "So....Your girlfriend took an item of yours with your permission then immediately tried to pawn it off for money? Not only are you NTA but that is a Titanic red flag, like a relationship ending sized red flag. She didn't care about the gem, your sentiment to it, any emotional value it might have had. Your stuff is just monetary gains for her.\n\nGet yourself a better partner dude wtf is that.", "NTA\n\n1. She asked for the fake gem (you didn't just give it to her).\n2.
