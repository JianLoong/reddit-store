Besides the news of our pregnancy, it was a pretty typical visit. Until his grandmas called. \n\nWhile we were all sitting having lunch, his maternal grandmother called my MIL to check in on her since she\u2019s been on a heart monitor this past few weeks. On a whim, I turn around to whisper to my FIL, \u201cdid y\u2019all tell Grandmas?\u201d FIL smiled sheepishly, and says \u201cwell I told my mom, I just couldn\u2019t hold it in\u201d. This was a little irritating but, I know that my FIL is EXTREMELY close to his mom and I just left it at that. \n\nEventually, my MIL got off the phone with her mom and I asked the same question \u201cDid you tell grandma that we\u2019re pregnant?\u201d MIL balls up her face, motions toward FIL and says, \u201cI only told mine because he told his\u2026\u201d  \nFast forward once again to a few days ago, I\u2019m sitting with my husband and I express to him that my feelings are really hurt that his parents took it upon themselves to share our news with the family without giving us any heads up. I told him I\u2019m not angry, but I feel disregarded, and I don\u2019t want to start a precedent where his parents can say/do anything they want when it comes to this pregnancy/baby. He smiled and said he understood, and that I should tell his parents if that\u2019s how I feel. \n\nSo we called both of his parents on FaceTime. I explained to his parents that I was hurt and a little irritated that they didn\u2019t ask or inform us that they had told the family. I explained that he and I wanted to wait to tell the extended family but they had ruined that plan. I explained that I wasnt mad or angry, I just wish they hadn\u2019t done it.  FIL smiled and apologized saying he was just excited, but going forward he won\u2019t share any updates without talking to us first. MIL once again balled up her face and said \u201cwell you should have made that clear in the beginning. We are just excited about our first grandchild. Make it clear next time.\u201d and then went back to whatever she was doing in. No apology. We said I love you and goodbye as usual. \n\nWhen I talked to my husband after we hung up, I said \u201cThey didn\u2019t take me seriously\u201d.

Because he thinks it's your problem to deal with, instead of recognising that keeping his family in line is HIS job.\n\nTell your partner that until your MIL apologises to you, she will be the last to know anything and everything to do with your baby and your life. She needs to understand that you, your partner and your child are now the family unit. She is just extended family. She makes no decisions about anything.

Only my husband knew, and he didn't have any family to tell.", "Not only told people, but did not tell them to keep it quiet until after the fact!\n\nAlthough I'm sending a stink eye to husband's saying that if that's \"how she feels\" she needs to tell them.\n\nEither he agrees (in which case he should deal with his family) or he doesn't (in which case the soon to be parents needed to get on the same page).", "Is it really normal to share other peoples personal news just because they told you? Especially with something like a pregnancy? I\u2019m genuinely curious because I don\u2019t share things I\u2019ve been told unless they SPECIFICALLY said it can be shared with others. Family,friends,coworkers etc. if you tell me something or vice versa that doesn\u2019t really mean it\u2019s free to be talked about.", "It should be common courtesy to not share SOMEONE ELSE\u2019S news. In-laws are TA.", "I\u2019m not mad tho\u2026. My feelings are just hurt.", "Hopefully with yourself for not making it clear that this shouldn't be shared.", "Fair enough.", "Thank you :) and that\u2019s a fair assessment. Like I said I\u2019m not ANGRY, just a bit peeved?", "You have got to be kidding! The in-laws overstepped. OP has literally nothing to apologize for!", "What am I apologizing for? Telling them that they hurt my feelings?", "They didn\u2019t tell them not to share. \n\nMy nephew (who I\u2019m extremely close up and helped raise) and his wife took my mom out Mothers Day weekend last year to tell her her first great grandchild was in the way. She told me. A week later, nephew invited us for brunch to share the same news. We already knew.  His response: \u201cOops, we didn\u2019t tell grandma we were going to go out with you to tell you this week\u201d. It was their bad not my mother\u2019s and they owned it.", "I was only 4wks pregnant. Only 6wks now. I\u2019m starting to pick up that I kinda am the AH bc I didn\u2019t make my expectations clear.", "Agree with the YTA - but only because you didn\u2019t tell them not to share the news. Grandparents get pretty excited about the news too and if you don\u2019t tell them your keeping it under wraps it\u2019s kind of understandable they\u2019d be excited to tell their own parents too", "It doesn\u2019t seem so at all. She told one person after FiL told one. And why is she taking the hits and not him? \n\nOh, right, Reddit rule #1 is mother-in-laws are all evil attention whores who try to destroy their daughters-in-law for fun. Because misogyny.", "No, we were so excited that we didn\u2019t even have a chance to make a plan. It had only been a few days between when we found out we were pregnant, and when we found out they\u2019d told them.", "They weren\u2019t even told it was a secret or that the news wasn\u2019t to be shared.", "Hard disagree - this situation is already gone too far because OP overreacted.  She never told the in-laws not to tell other people, they only told their own mothers, and they then got subjected to a scoldy FaceTime for breaking a rule they didn\u2019t know was in place.  I\u2019d ball up my face too!\n\nI get why OP is disappointed, but it doesn\u2019t look like the news spread too far, so unless she wants to spend the next 18 years fighting WWIII, she should drop it and move on.", "OP\u2019s in laws didn\u2019t do anything wrong. She never told them that they couldn\u2019t tell anyone about the pregnancy. OP was wrong for not making her boundaries known when as first shared the news", "People did this with mine too. With your first (or any) pregnancy you want to be the one to tell the good news so you can see their excitement for the first time too. They took this opportunity away from them.", "Even though they probably should have checked before sharing, you also should have been more clear about your expectations.", "Fastest methods of telecommunication:\nTelevision\nTelephone\nTell a Mom", "Was one of those house plant elephant ears?  Those suckers hear everything!", "I think it's totally normal to tell your mother something about your daughter or son. Absolutely.", "You are expecting an apology from them, but they did nothing wrong. That is unreasonable. YTA.", "Got it. I think you realize now you need to be clearer about your wants and expectations. My point still stands that you aren't happy that the in-laws hurt your feelings and it was something they had no idea was wrong.", "Why? You told them as soon as you found out and expected them to not to share that information. If it mattered to you for that informed to stay locked in then you needed to hold off saying anything to anyone. Not trying to be harsh here just trying to be realistic.", "Put yourself in their shoes. They are thrilled for you and for themselves. It would be hard not to share the news with their own parents. In 5 years will this matter? In 10 years? Let it go and focus on yourself and your baby. Congratulations! Wishing you health and smooth sailing!", "Maybe for chiding them about something that was ultimately your fault? Your MIL reacted correctly. You can't blame someone for not following rules that were never verbalized. If your feelings were hurt, they aren't at fault.", "You confronted them about violating a boundary they didn\u2019t know existed. If your feelings are hurt by their actions, you only have yourself and your husband to blame for that. You admitted it was your fault for not making your expectations known and then ask that they ask your permission before sharing any pregnancy related updates in the future. You should have left your hurt feelings out of it because that implies they did something wrong and they didn\u2019t. That\u2019s why your MIL stood up for herself and refused to apologize for something she didn\u2019t do.", "You\u2019re not the AH, this is a common family situation. You expressed a boundary, going forward they understand and seem to be willing to respect it. All good, if it happens again after this conversation I would raise an eyebrow. Otherwise this is just something that happens sometimes, people get really excited about babies and don\u2019t think about the potential loss factor.", "Not to scare you or anything but there is still so much time that something can go wrong - so tell your mil/fil if worst comes to worst that you are not comfortable sharing a loss with the grandmas and it is their job to tell them because you will be too devastated to do that.\n\nThat's why you only tell people you can rely on making the loss easier and not harder in the first trimester... (and they shouldn't tell it anyone else) \n\nCommon pregnancy courtesy - or maybe just what I experienced with the pregnancies around me...", "So, honest question - if you didn't make that clear, how did you expect them to know? It might seem like common sense, but it's also unusual (in my experience anyway) for people to tell ANYONE right after finding out. Is it possible this was an honest mistake?", "[deleted]", "A pothos. They spread news everywhere. And a cactus. What a prick.", "We\u2019ve been trying to have a baby for a year. We were excited. Like I said, I\u2019m not mad, I guess I just wanted to make sure that my expectations weren\u2019t super unreasonable?", "Did you notice \u201cI did NOT make the expectation known\u201d?", "The \"agreement\" was between her and her SO.", "OP admits in the comments that she did not tell her in laws they couldn\u2019t tell anyone.", "I hear you- but that doesn't really answer the question: how were they supposed to know? That question really goes to the core of whether your expectations were reasonable. You can't be surprised that people don't meet your expectations of you don't make them clear.\n\nRegardless, hopefully this ends up being a fairly minor blip in an otherwise happy occasion.", "ESH\n\nIn-laws for not keeping their cake holes shut\n\nYou guys because duh, what did you expect", "OP, you aren\u2019t exactly TA here, just don\u2019t escalate it. Remember to put specific caveats from next time. I would be upset but I do understand their excitement.\n\nI have placed a very very hard embargo on my pregnancy information. I reiterate every time family is mentioned. Absolutely no sharing the news till I explicitly say so.", "Keep them on an information diet for a while. Wait to see how things play out. Maybe MIL will apologize. \n\nCongrats! NTA", "Now you know, don't tell your in-laws anything you do not want shared.", "YTA. \n\nI didn\u2019t think you were until your edit where you stated clearly *you did not tell them your expectation* that they keep it secret.", "You shouldn't have to explain! Nobody should be telling the news to anyone but you! You had be ttc a year and had a loss then MIL is making it all about her, your husband should have never put this all onto you he should have spoken about it to them and asked them to be restful, you're carrying his child it's his job to keep you stress free. They both knew they were in the wrong that's why FIL smiled and said he told his mom and MIL definitely knew hence why she said I only told my mum because you told yours. She then tried to gaslight you and manipulate you. You have every right to be upset here, you two make this baby not them, atleast FIL apologied but MIL made it all about her and sorry but your husband shouod have said something then and there (sounds like he didn't say much with how you wrote your post so not sure if this is correct so apologies if I'm wrong). I get their excitement but they need to atleast ask you if they can share. Try not let it get to you, maybe try meeting up clear the air ask hubby to take the lead. This is meant to be an exciting time and you need to be resting and relaxing.", "It sounds like the reason you asked \"did you tell Grandma\" in the first place is because you knew they had, or suspected they would. So why get all mad, if you knew they couldn't keep a secret? It's not worth being mad over.", "It isn't just your in laws, it's all of them. They all have a big mouth and make excuses.", "Yeah I kept my pregnancy a secret until our 12 week scan to make sure everything was on track before we even told our parents", "I agree.\n\nShe had enough time to tell them about the pregnancy but not enough time to tell them to keep it to themselves.", "Dead ass...if I ever get pregnant again (not likely) I'm telling like...no one until I'm damn good and ready.\n\nAnd then I'll tell everyone \ud83e\udd23", "With a pregnancy, yeah, it's a normal thing to share. Pregnancy, marriage/engagement, and death are the main status updates among family. Also extended, life-threatening hospitalization and things like that. With larger families, there is usually no expectation for a single person or couple to phone each family member individually.", "My mil was a bit hurt that I didn't tell her we were trying for a kid but the way I see it that choice was between me and my partner \nI didn't even tell my parents we were trying \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\ude05", "It isn't fair. You don't announce someone else's pregnancy. Your in-laws are in the wrong, your MIL is a piece of work, and you should tread carefully moving forward. This is just the start.", "Definitely..exactly what this person said.  Don\u2019t get all het up about it\u2026you\u2019ve got a long road ahead.  Delight in it.  If you\u2019re going to stick your butt about about this, sheesh, it won\u2019t get easier for the next forever.   Lighten up..you\u2019ve got a LOT MORE important things to worry about than your in laws being excited.  Don\u2019t alienate them by needlessly chastising and shitting on them right now"]}
