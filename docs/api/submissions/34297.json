I suggest you should make a note or set a reminder in your phone or keep a to do list on a whiteboard in your room (this last one has helped me personally!). Also, once you knew that you were double booked, you could have made sure that no more issues arise and confirmed the duration for which you were expected to babysit or conveyed then and there to your sister that nighttime would not work for you.

She was insulting you and yelling at you after saying it was 3 hours and leaving the kid for 11?  That's 100% never babysitting for you again territory, totally unreasonable and unacceptable, no babysitter would accept the child being left indefinitely like that and it if she or anyone else (your mom or others) pushes back, the answer is hell no, she's a liar and an AH, she asked me to watch for 3 hours then had the gall to yell at me after 11 hours, any other babysitter would have dropped the kid off with cops at that point, never again.", "Your sister is taking advantage of you. She doesn't care if she told you 3 hrs. She sees you as someone that she can take full advantage of their time.\n\nPlus she doesn't pay you.

It rained the following Saturday, which caused my brother's soccer game to be cancelled.  My mother was furious with me because she said it was my fault that my brother's soccer game was cancelled.  (She believes that if you wash your car, it will cause the weather to rain the next day.)  She said I knew my brother had a soccer game \"because it was written on the calendar\", so I washed the car on purpose so it would get cancelled.   Couldn't convince her otherwise.

How/why mom is mad at OP makes no sense", "Exactly this, and if this was so important to the sister, she should have made a reminder call the day before.  If I ask someone to do something on a specific day that is 4-5 days away, I either send a reminder text or call.  That's just being considerate, and especially if we are talking about a 14yr old.

In any case one thing we can both agree on is she DARVO'd the crap out of OP. It was bad enough when I didn't catch onto the age gap between the sisters, and became quite disgusting when I realised OP is 19 years younger. That's some very shitty behaviour from the older sis.", "I agree that in and of itself it's not parentification. If this were happening a couple times a week then it would be.\n\nBut yes if you're babysitting and the child's parent is more than a couple hours late without communicating it absolutely is police worthy.

Just weird.", "Thank you!  Yeah I'm 40 now, and looking back I think a lot of the things I \"did\" were just excuses she made up to be mad at me.  She didn't like her life as a SAHM, but she couldn't blame herself for her life choices so she blamed me.  That was one of the more unhinged examples, but I have a lot more.", "100% agree with this.", "well yes young teenagers are typically like that....it's their first time being here after all, they're learning as they go", "Seriously!

Is it okay that you forgot? No. Of course not, but you\u2019re a child still and shit happens. Should you start finding ways to make yourself remember responsibilities? Yes, absolutely.

I would say you were, but you added details further down that you were only supposed to babysit until 2 pm.  It would have been reasonable for you to start calling your sister by 2:30 or so, with hopefully backup from your grandmother, and it was very kind of you to babysit the rest of the afternoon.\n\nI echo a few others here - it's time to get a calendar or a planner or start using a calendar app in your phone if you have one, but start jotting these things down so you don't miss out on something that is really important to you because you forgot about another commitment. \n\nBut, in this instance?  your sister was definitely taking advantage of you and you didn't do anything wrong.", "YTA.  Babysitting is not a small trivial commitment.  You should have considered it carefully before saying yes.  She asked you several days in advance in case she needed to make other plans so she would not have to do this last minute.  Accepting the responsibility sets up a chain of events that can potentially affect a lot of people.  What you did was highly irresponsible and depending on the event your sister planned for could have had major impact.

She told your mom you agreed to the overnight visit, and the kid probably really did think she was going somewhere boring.", "Well..
