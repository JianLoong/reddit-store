My daughter (10), wife and other stepson (8) will also be there. Since it's 14's birthday, he gets to bring a friend with him. My daughter wants to bring a friend as well, but we said no because it isn't her birthday.\n\nMy daughter is upset and says this is unfair and that she will have no one to hang out with on the trip. She can hang out with the younger boy, but she doesn't want to. That's fine, she doesn't have to. Skiing is fun on its own. Plus I'll be there, and we'll do fun dad & daughter things.\n\nI asked my daughter how she would feel if it was her birthday and her stepbrothers got to invite their friends, so the event wasn't really about her anymore. She said that was different, because if it was her birthday the two boys could hang out with each other. They're almost six years apart, so that comparison is iffy to me. In the end I told her no, and she was free to continue sharing her feelings with me, and I'll listen, but we're not inviting another kid ($$$) on the trip.\n\nWell, she complained to her mom, who called me up and told me I was being horrid to our daughter. She said if I was going to be like that then she would pick daughter up the day before our trip and take her and a friend somewhere. I said she was welcome to do that, but to consider the lesson that teaches our daughter. She called me an ass and said she'll get our daughter, just give her the dates.\n\nI asked my daughter if she wants to go with her mom, because I'm not going to cancel the ticket if she still wants to go. She started crying and said I didn't want her there. I feel like I've made a mess of everything.

You and your wife need to have a serious conversation about your parenting methods and goals. You are not on the same page.

That's a normal family situation.\n\nI honestly don't understand your wife in this situation and what she is trying to achieve. Daughter gets a special trip because she complained about her step-brother's birthday trip? What is that?\n\nEdit: I misread this and now realize it's your ex inserting herself.

She's the only girl surrounded by boys. If you look for something to be unhappy about you'll always find it.\n\nI don't get what you're saying here. This trip is specifically for the oldest kid's birthday. Obviously we want all the kids to have fun, but we're not going to devote time to letting the other kids pick the schedule on someone's birthday trip.

Each additional unrelated kid is exponentially more work\u2014especially the younger they are.", "In that case, you are definitely NTA.  \n\nIt sounds like she is having a hard time, but it doesn't sound like you have made a mess out of anything.

She could hang out with stepmom too, but if she doesn't want to spend time with younger stepbrother, she'll have to hang out with your wife when you're with the younger boy, and vice versa.
