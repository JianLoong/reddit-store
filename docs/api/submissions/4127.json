She said that was different, because if it was her birthday the two boys could hang out with each other. They're almost six years apart, so that comparison is iffy to me. In the end I told her no, and she was free to continue sharing her feelings with me, and I'll listen, but we're not inviting another kid ($$$) on the trip.\n\nWell, she complained to her mom, who called me up and told me I was being horrid to our daughter. She said if I was going to be like that then she would pick daughter up the day before our trip and take her and a friend somewhere. I said she was welcome to do that, but to consider the lesson that teaches our daughter. She called me an ass and said she'll get our daughter, just give her the dates.\n\nI asked my daughter if she wants to go with her mom, because I'm not going to cancel the ticket if she still wants to go.

It never fails that the kid feels like they are in the middle, even if they aren't. But more often than not, one parent is putting them in the middle.

That has a lot to do with it too.", "Tbh ESH\n\nYour right that its not her birthday so she doesn't get to bring a friend along, but does she normally play/get along with your youngest stepson? Or is it they/she are forced together as they are closer in age than 14? I don't think cancelling her ticket is the way to go, cos she might not even want to go skiing, but want the time with you. Hence the you don't even want me there comment. She might just be being spoilt, but she might be feeling pushed aside. Just something to consider. \n\nYour ex has no say. She isn't paying for the trip and I get her wanting to support your daughter, but telling her she can do XYZ with her when she doesn't get her own way with you isn't good parenting and will cause problems for both of you down the line when she either can't afford to do XYZ or doesn't think the situation warrants it.\n\nShe is being 10. Shes in that weird age where she isn't a child no more but not quite a preteen. She doesn't want to hang round boys.

She doesn't understand the financial cost of a ski trip either.", "Ok! So as a girl who had similar issues as a kid not having another little girl with me on family trips made me very uncomfortable. Even if I had time with my parent it was still an anxiety enduring situation. Maybe have your daughter bring a friend IF that friends parents can pay for them. It may be crowded but it truly will help your daughter feel more comfortable and heard. Explain to her that on her birthdays she needs to have the same understanding for her step brothers. This is a teachable moment but please remember that to be isolated at that age or around only boys can be very very stressful. Especially when you have to share a room with a boy. At puberty that can be so so uncomfortable and sometimes having another friend there can truly be a support system that can change the outlook of the situation. I don\u2019t think YTA.

That never stopped them hanging out on trips.", "I don't think it's necessarily about the money, though, but about the privilege of bringing a friend reserved for the birthday kid.\n\nShe's likely feeling insecure because a trip with three boys can easily feel like it will be intimidating or lonely to a 10-year-old girl. All he has to do is make sure she feels loved and valued and wanted, but that it's also completely okay if she decides the better option for her is to go somewhere with her mother and bring a friend.", "I don't think it's fair to accuse a 10-year-old child of emotional blackmail here. It sucks sometimes being the only girl on a trip with three boys. She knows that. I know that. Everyone who has been a 10-year-old girl knows that. Hopefully she'll have so much fun with her father that it'll be fine. While I don't think the way the mother is going about it is ideal, having an alternative isn't a bad thing here. As long as the daughter feels wanted both places, she can decide what kind of weekend she wants to have - skiing without a friend, or trip with mom with a friend.", "Being the only girl on a trip with boys is often not very fun, and can be intimidating (older boys) and overall quite lonely. I'm not saying allow her to bring a friend, I think you're right in limiting it to the birthday boy, but try to understand why she's asking to bring a friend. She's likely worried she'll feel left out.", "I think the last question is asking whenever you have your daughter, are all the activities with the whole family or do you do you set apart daddy/daughter time?\n\nEdit spelling", "You sound like an amazing father.\n\nI think it is important she understands she has a choice - she can go on the ski trip without bringing a friend, or she can go somewhere with her mother and bring a friend. Not in a stressful ultimatum way. No hostility. Two awesome options and a choice to make about the kind of weekend she wants to have.\n\nJust make sure she knows that you'd love to experience the ski trip with her, let her know the fun things you'll do just the two of you on the trip, and that if she chooses not to go she will be missed but you will not be mad at her.\n\nMaybe the two of you can sit down and make a \"pro\" and \"con\" list for both options? Perhaps it will help you understand the root of why she's so focused on bringing a friend (ie is she worried she'll be alone? left out?) and help ease her fears.", "DEFINITELY do lessons! Skiing is not a sport you want to figure out on your own. Maybe you can let her know you'd love to learn to ski together? Take lessons together?\n\nAs the only girl going on a trip with three boys, I *completely* understand her hesitation. That sounds like a pretty lonely time to most 10-year-old girls.", "NTA. Your daughter sounds spoiled and your wife is an asshole", "If I was your daughter I would just not go because I don't like skiing, let alone going with just dad, step mom, step bros and their friends. I can understand why she'd feel being left out. You'd be there for her, but you're also have to be there for your son since it's his birthday.  It's a tough situation because she'd be alone the entire trip (with your presence sometimes) or she'd stay home and feel even more left out. Maybe talk to her about the money issues because \"it's my son's birthday\" won't do.", "NTA - I\u2019d it just me or is both the x wife and daughter both working together  to manipulate the Dad?", "Just you", "Yeah, because 10 year olds always think about the financial side of trips?", "Of course not when people point out where your wrong your brain goes shopping but when they agree with you man you got a whole response waiting", "Because 10 year old girls are getting bigger they don't want to hang out with parents or younger children but girls their own age so they can talk and do things they like", "So not only will she be stuck with boys the entire trip she has to share a room with one wow you really didn't think about your daughter at all she is 10 I have a 10 year old daughter their not going to want to stay around parents or younger kids but girls their own age", "So then it's a easy solution for OP tell his 14 year old stepson the trip is for his birthday yeah but his friend can't come since their tight on money"]}
