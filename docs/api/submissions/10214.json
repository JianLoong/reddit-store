That way you can present video evidence of her peeping into your house.", "NTA and I'm angry you feel you have to justify yourself here. \n\nI'd file a harassment/peeping Tom report on her.

If anything you could get that woman in trouble for harassment and being a peeping Tom.", "NTA... and what does she think a prostitute is?", "NTA Some people are just miserable and need something to complain about. You should tell her you could call the police on her for peeping.", "Obviously NTA. No idea what crazy pills your neighbor was taking.", "NTA. This lady needs to chill", "Nta you're in your home. First off you said that everything was covered while you're in your house; so there should not be any issues with that. Second and last, you should be allowed to whip that tit out and feed your child for everyone to see even if you're in public, the baby needs to eat.", "No, you are absolutely NOT the a-hole.  The lady creeper \"Peeping-Tommette\" is.  And, then I think you could also add a few other things to describe her . . . namely . . . entirely unstable, disturbingly aggressive and confrontational, providing the perfect character study for a horror movie villain.\n\nIf you have other similar interactions with this individual, please put her on notice that you will be calling the police and filing a restraining order because her hostility and lack of boundaries is very, very disturbing.", "NTA you can feed your baby when you want to you\u2019re the mother. this woman sounds crazy fr has she does this before?", "NTA\n\nDon\u2019t doubt yourself\u2026it\u2019s is creepy what she did, so calling her a creep is appropriate.\n\nIt is hard enough being a parent when we\u2019re out in public with the parenting police, but to have some one come to your home and critizing breastfeeding is just ridiculous:\n\nShe could close her curtains or not look in your window.\n\nI\u2019m sorry your neighbor is rude.", "NTA. You are perfectly fine her, completely in the right. This woman shouldn\u2019t be going around peeping into the windows of her neighbors. If you can\u2019t breastfeed your child in your own home, where can you?\n\nAnd breastfeeding is not indecent. It is perfectly natural. It is this crazy woman who is sexualizing it and making a big deal out of it.", "> I told her she was a creep for staring in our window and to F off \n\nPretty sure we can all forgive a breastfeeding mom for being more than a little upset at someone doing this and look past the perfectly reasonable part where you told her to fuck off. She had no business spying on you and needs to mind her own business. Some fucking people are just too much. NTA", "NTA.  You could report her to the police for disturbing the peace, etc.", "NTA. It was unhinged of her:\n\n1. Shaming and sexualizing you for breastfeeding \n2. Telling you what to do in your own home\n3. Watching you through your window(s)\n4. Threatening you\n5. Exhibiting clear anger management issues\n\nYou did nothing wrong, and if she attempts to harass you again, you need to call the police to start documentation before she escalates any further.", "NTA. You were breastfeeding in your own home which isn\u2019t a public pace and if the woman was so offended she could\u2019ve looked away or kept on walking. She probably gets off on being pissy.

Imagine not only having the gall to peek in someone's window long enough to determine they're breastfeeding but then to knock on the door and yell at that person. That person that yelled at you was out of line.", "NTA however your neighbour is one though.

Crazy woman shouldn't have been looking through your windows and you may have issues moving forward with her. Reporting now will help if you need to make further reports for harrassment", "Absolutely NTA\nShe looked through *your window* like some kind of perv, who does that - she could have kept on walking & mind her own business but felt entitled to aggressively express her opinion to your face", "NTA tell her to call the cops. I'd start breastfeeding buckass neked in my home if she tried that with me.", "You are absolutely NTA in this situation. Breastfeeding is a natural and necessary function, and you were doing it in your own home, which should be a safe and comfortable space for you and your baby. You were not exposing any more of your body than necessary to feed your baby, and you were not doing anything indecent or inappropriate.", "NTA\n\nThat woman though. Omg. Huge, massive AH. You were feeding your child. When and where you do that is up to you anyway, but what sort of weirdo knocks on the door to complain about something they saw whilst staring into your window?! Sweet Jesus. \n\nCarry on and don\u2019t give that weirdo a second thought.", "What the hell kind of person stares into someone else\u2019s home with enough intensity to determine someone is breastfeeding instead of holding their baby? She\u2019s a creep and way overstepped. You have the right to do whatever you want to in your own home, and she can take her strange fixation elsewhere. NTA, and I don\u2019t blame you for feeling uneasy. It is not your duty to close the blinds to make her feel better, but if you would feel safer doing that, then please do whatever makes you feel most secure.", "NTA and good for you to tell her to f*** off! The audacity of that individual, telling you what to do in your home. She is a creep and trespassing, you would have been in the right to call the police on HER actually.\n\nPlease, please don't feel bad about any of this even for a second! Breastfeeding is such a natural and wonderful thing. I'm breastfeeding my son too and here where I live not one person is in any way bothered by that. Older or younger, they all fully support mothers whatever they choose/need to do - breastfeed or use formula. \n\nPeople who sexualise breastfeeding are the only ones with a problem, not mothers who want to feed their babies. And what you do in YOUR home is your business, nobody else's. I'd be careful though, that woman sounds unhinged and might come again. \n\nEnjoy your home, your time with your children and the wonderful thing called breastfeeding WHEREVER YOU ARE, but especially in the safety and happiness of your home.", "NTA\n\nAs a lactating mom, I would\u2019ve taken my boob and shot a stream right in her face.", "NTA.", "NTA in the slightest. You\u2019re in the comfort of your own home. What are you supposed to do, lock yourself in the cupboard and feed? This woman stared through your window for far too long to even register that that was what you were doing.", "NTA but I would look into charging her. I thought peeping into someone else's window was illegal. And telling her to F off should country as a finer moment. She deserved that and more.", "NTA. Why is the looking in your window?", "NTA. Of course you are within your right to breastfeed in your own home. And it doesn\u2019t matter that breastfeeding in public is legal where you live, because you were not in public but in your own home! If she comes again then call the cops on her for harassment.", "NTA, not one bit\u2026\n\nBut seriously consider at least notifying the police of this situation; you have a random person looking into your windows & verbally assaulting you in the privacy of your own home\u2026 creepy doesn\u2019t even begin to cover this!", "NTA. You just got a crazy at your door. Sorry you had to deal with that. Try to just shrug it off.", "Should you have closed the blinds?  Only if you wanted to.  I'm glad you told her to F off.  Some people can't mind their own damn business.  NTA.", "NTA I would have called the police", "NTA. You have the right to feel secure in your own home. People are so weird about breast feeding. On the occasions I've seen it happening in public, it's no big deal, the mothers are always mostly covered up, it's not like they're sitting there topless or something.\n\nI suppose it would be prudent to close blinds/be away from windows if you've got snoopy neighbors like that. Even though you are on the right side legally, it would be a hassle to have to deal w/the police (assuming they'd even show up).", "When peeping toms don't like what they see, they should probably keep it to themselves.

Or have your so do it. But in all seriousness your a month feeding your baby. Your not in the wrong. You was in the privacy of your own home. You are not in the wrong your taking care of your own baby.", "NTA, she's a peeper and creeper. I would keep my blinds permanently closed though because you know she's looking.
