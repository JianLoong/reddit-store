WELL THEY ARE TA X A MILLION.\n\n It is TERRIBLE parenting to pull a stunt like this.  Not \"reasonable\" b/c your sister \"knew the risks of playing soccer.\"  That's the dumbest thing I ever heard.  Parents are responsible for ensuring their children have medical treatment.  There are very few things parents need to do for their children - and a sophomore in high school is a child - but ensuring they have medical treatment is one of them.  Your parents didn't hit that bar.\n\nHaving kids has risks. You could have had cancer.  And then what? Boo hoo?  You knew the risks of being a person, and some people get cancer.  You are victim-blaming in a HORRID way.\n\nThis should have zero to do with college funds, but somehow your parents made it about college funds, so that's them being TA though.\n\nYeah, your sister has a right to bitch to all y'all's friends, b/c it's shitty they did that to her.  FYI, being in activities (especially bigger activities, like sports) is good for college apps, good for your health vs sitting on your ass and watching tiktoks or whatever. Yes, there are risks, but there are also rewards to those activities, and that's what most not completely nutty  people see when their kids sign up for sports.", "Info.

You\u2019ve said in your comments that they *could* afford to handle those bills without dipping into her college fund - and that they did indeed pay for *your* sports-related injury.

Do you not see the absurdity in this? I\u2019ve never heard of parents putting conditions like this on sports participation, and I\u2019m sure you haven\u2019t either.
