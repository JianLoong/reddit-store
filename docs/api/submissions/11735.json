I also don\u2019t know exactly what she did in her fit of anger, that could change my mind, but also like I said, you maybe have used a different term.

Did you pass him a note saying *Do you like my bestie, check yes or no?* That seems beneath all 3 people involved at your age.\n\nI don't know your friend but, based on her reaction, I can guess. Some women are comfortable with their body and have no problem embracing the word fat. Other women may like their body but hate the negative connotations attached to the word fat. And then there are women who don't like their bodies and the word fat is attached to a mountain of awful experiences. \n\nMy guess is your friend is a 2 or a 3. And as her best-friend you should 100% where she lies and how she feels about her body or the words to describe it. \n\nIt doesn't matter if *you* think the word fat is ok, it's if *she* does.

Tbh the most I would feel comfortable doing for a friend is checking with my guy friend if he is even moderately interested. Did you attempt to say no and that it really makes you uncomfortable?  If so she really shouldn't have pushed. Maybe she could have asked to be brought to the same events -if- shy but eh.\n\nHe was an AH for the way he as reacted. Laughing and saying he doesn't date fat people. It is the high and mighty attitude that is AH here not his dating preference just FYI. We all do have ours so no reason to judge his but the way he expressed his is just ugly (he knew you were her friend so I think he could have predicted you will be burdened with passing the message on). So he is also semi AH for absolute lack of consideration towards you and the difficult position he put you to pass it on. He really should have either asked for your friend's number so he can turn her down directly (as in, 'sorry, I have heard that you like me but I don't think we would be a good match. I am sure there is someone out there for you. Bye' and then he can happily ghost her for all I care)  or just say 'sorry, I don't think about X that way and I don't think there is a chance I can see her in that light/sorry to put you in that position'. \n\nYou may be AH to yourself for agreeing to sth that made you so uncomfortable. Probably could have been gentler as well with her but honestly --- I can't say I wouldn't be probably blunt myself. As in say 'Listen gal, he is an absolute ass. Don't go after him. He fat shames people' I don't respect that. IDK tbh probably either. But you also call her fat and make it sound okay by saying it is not 'bad'. Does she seriously consider herself fat (or just does the whole meme self pity ritual we all do when we try to tell ourselves we are too far for life)? If she doesn't, you don't get to call and judge her that way. That would make you an AH and lack of consideration for her feelings make you double AH.   \n\nEveryone has missed here one point. We don't know if the girl who actually asked the 'middleman' (middlegirl?) is actually fat. I am not saying either way but I know waaaay too many people who would consider person with 1-10 extra kilos above the thin norm, straight away fat.
