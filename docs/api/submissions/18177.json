How I can't wait to have a name buddy...and how I have already ordered custom monogrammed baby clothes etc etc and can't wait to have a mini me\n\nMy guess is that your sister will magically rethink the name rather than share her kid with you", "First, ask her why she's choosing that name. It's a valid question since it's your name, too. You can tell her it makes you uncomfortable since it's so close to your name and hope she respects that but that's all you can do. \n\nIf she doesn't change her mind you can start suggesting nicknames for the baby just so \"everyone will know which one of us you're talking to\".  And make them really good nicknames, like PeePoo or something.", "Info: are we talking about Sarah and Sara or are we talking about something like Sara and Tara?", "NAH. Just tell her that you\u2019re honored she\u2019s planning to name the baby after you and how everyone will know that she thinks incredibly highly of you and that you and your niece will have such a special bond, etc. \n\nThen just be ready to be unoffended when she changes it.", "NAH\n\nYou can ask, but ultimately it is her decision. You don\u2019t \u201cown\u201d the name.", "NAH\n\nShe can pick whatever name she wants.\n\nYou are allowed to feel weird about it, is it worth it to bring it up, I don\u2019t know?\n\nIf my brother, who I\u2019m fond of, named a kid after me, or even worse almost after me, I\u2019d probably disappear to like Guatemala. Guess it depends on your culture but that\u2019s insane to me.", "No.  Just use your words.  Be honest, but recognize her position--as the one who makes the final decision.\n\nTell her it would make you uncomfortable, but that ultimately, it's her choice--since it is.  Tell her what your concerns are--if you have specific ones.  You might just also ask her why she wants to name her daughter when her sister has virtually the same name.", "Tbh whatever your name is, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the only person with it.", "info: What is the name? As another user has pointed out, changing one letter of a name can make a difference (Milly -> Tilly is different from Kaitlin -> Caitlin)", "NAH. \n\nIt\u2019s weird to me.

Do remind her though that as close as it is to your name her daughter might not be happy about being named after someone and not having her own unique name.", "I mean you could be the AH depending on how you handle this situation but just talk to her and ask why she choose the name don't talk about your feeling or opinions until after you ask.", "NAH.\n\nYou can't \"tell\" her to change the name, ultimately that is up to the parents to decide, and you don't have any power to change that.  \n\nBut you should have a conversation with your sister about it -- ask her why she chose the name.  Yes, conversations can be difficult, but they are often necessary.  \n\nPersonally, I don't think what she's doing is a good idea.  I'm glad I don't essentially share a name with any or my aunts or uncles.  There are so many names out there.  Let the kid have their own identity within the family, not a first name that is shared with a close, living relative who is only 20 years older.", "YTA\n\nSo she names the baby after you essentially. And rather than be supportive you came back with this.\n\n>it just feels like she literally didn\u2019t even think about the fact that it\u2019s my name\n\nShe's not an idiot. She know the name she picked is one letter off your name.", "YWBTA if you brought this up to her. I guarantee you that she **already knows** that the name is 1 letter different than yours. The name being that similar is not an accident. She obviously thinks enough of you (and your name) to name her child after you.", "I don\u2019t want to judge but honestly as a person currently trying to name a baby, trust me, you think of of person you have ever met with a name while trying to decide if you like it. There is no way your sister picked your name without realizing it was the same as your\u2019s.", "If you outright tell her to pick a different name, yes. Voicing your displeasure is understandable.", "NTA - but you need to handle this tactfully, I think you need to see her in person and have a proper conversation.\n\nSay how honoured you are that she's considering something that sounds like your name but you think it would be nice for her daughter to have her own name and own identity in the family. Perhaps the name could be a middle name if she likes it so much.", "NTA - it's borderline creepy naming a LO after someone close and still alive, not to mention putting the LO in the shadow of that person instead of having its own identity to grow into.\n\nEdit:  it's creepy when it's done over someone's objections.", "YTA \n\nYour sister and her significant other can name their baby whatever they like", "YTA / YWBTA. Whether she's naming her kid after you or just likes the name itself, it's essentially none of your business.", "NTA.", "YTA, it\u2019s not your baby to name.\n\nIt\u2019s a name who cares, if anything just legally change your name if it bothers you that much.", "YWBTA\n\nYou don't get to gatekeep names. She may be trying to honor you, or she may just really like that name. The reason is irrelevant. It's her baby, and she gets to choose whatever name she wants.", "NTA\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so excited to be an aunt. It is kind of you to want to name the child after me. Please choose a different name. This is an entire new human & I want them to feel they are completely unique. You know how those juniors feel?\u201d \n\nAlso, you may not feel it right now but I\u2019d take it as a huge honor IIWM. \n\nPregnancy hormones can make a woman emotional. It did for me. Be prepared for anything when you choose to have this conversation.", "Yes, YTA.", "YTA. Why is it so bad for her to have a name similar to yours? I don\u2019t get how it hurts you at all.", "You don't have the right to say that to her", "YWBTA. You do not own your name or any similar names.", "YTA, you can't gatekeep your name.\n\nAnd unless you've got a super uncommon name, it is perfectly possible that she and her fianc\u00e9 have chosen this name together to honour both you *and* someone on the paternal side of the family.", "Yes, you would be TA.", "YTA.  You can talk to her and ask her why she chose the name and mention how it is so similar to yours.  Then ask her if she is naming the baby for you.  However, she can name her child whatever she wants.", "YTA. Mainly for not asking her. You can literally just sent a text like \u201c Hey I\u2019m just curious why are you pick that name\u201d. I guess there\u2019s always a small chance she could be like \u201c Because you suck so bad the name deserve someone better\u201d But 99% likely she is going to mention honoring you or even just the fact that she likes the name.", "YTA your name isn\u2019t your whole personality, so just accept the fact that the names will be almost the same instead of probably ruining your relationship with your sister", "YWBTA baby names are for the parents to decide. Let it go.", "YTA. Why are people here always mad over baby names? It's not YOUR baby!", "My niece\u2019s name is one letter off from mine. She is only 3 years younger than me. Of course I wasn\u2019t old enough to care when she was born. I don\u2019t care now either, lol. I love that her name is almost mine!", "YWBTA\n\nYou don\u2019t own words.\n\nLike what exactly do you have to lose here?", "YTA if you ask her to pick a different name. You may just mention that it sounds a lot like your name. If she doesn't be an issue with that then let it go.", "Maybe this is her way of rebuilding those connections, and showing you how important you are to her.", "Yes, you would be", "You\u2019re NTA for feeling weird about it, I would to. But you don\u2019t own the name and if she really wants to name her baby that you can\u2019t really do anything. \nIt does seem very odd that she wouldn\u2019t realise  how similar it is to yours. I also find it very strange you mum and grandma are totally unfazed by this. \nHas your sister mentioned it to you at any point? Does her fianc\u00e9 maybe have a relative with that name and they\u2019re honouring them? \nI do think you should talk to her but maybe don\u2019t straight up ask her to pick a different name otherwise you\u2019ll get nowhere. Could you say something like \u2018it\u2019s going to be confusing when the baby gets here etc\u2019 and lead into it like that?", "Yta, hundreds of people share the same or similar names. She's doing this to honour someone she loves very much, and you throw it back in her face so rudely? Maybe she should pick a new name but not to appease you, but because it seems you don't seem to appreciate the gravity of a child being named after you.", "YTA.  But what I would do, is pretty much as soon as possible, talk to her and make a light-hearted comment about \"awww, you're naming your baby after me!!  We'll be twinsies!\"  Or something like that.  And see how she reacts.\n\nEveryone else is right, you can't gatekeep your name, but you can point it out and find out about her thought process.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It\u2019s none of your business how your sister wants to name her baby, even if the name is very similar to yours. \n\nThis is a matter of boundaries, and voicing your opinions on someone else\u2019s baby name, unless asked to, violates it. \n\nI would react very negatively to this conversation if I was your sister. \n\nAlso, she is 100% aware that the name is close to yours, and my guess is that she just likes the name or you enough to name the baby like that.", "NAH Does she know the gender?
