Perhaps the name could be a middle name if she likes it so much.", "NTA - it's borderline creepy naming a LO after someone close and still alive, not to mention putting the LO in the shadow of that person instead of having its own identity to grow into.\n\nEdit:  it's creepy when it's done over someone's objections.", "YTA \n\nYour sister and her significant other can name their baby whatever they like", "YTA / YWBTA.

You do not own your name or any similar names.", "YTA, you can't gatekeep your name.\n\nAnd unless you've got a super uncommon name, it is perfectly possible that she and her fianc\u00e9 have chosen this name together to honour both you *and* someone on the paternal side of the family.", "Yes, you would be TA.", "YTA.  You can talk to her and ask her why she chose the name and mention how it is so similar to yours.  Then ask her if she is naming the baby for you.  However, she can name her child whatever she wants.", "YTA. Mainly for not asking her. You can literally just sent a text like \u201c Hey I\u2019m just curious why are you pick that name\u201d.

I love that her name is almost mine!", "YWBTA\n\nYou don\u2019t own words.\n\nLike what exactly do you have to lose here?", "YTA if you ask her to pick a different name. You may just mention that it sounds a lot like your name.

But you don\u2019t own the name and if she really wants to name her baby that you can\u2019t really do anything. \nIt does seem very odd that she wouldn\u2019t realise  how similar it is to yours. I also find it very strange you mum and grandma are totally unfazed by this. \nHas your sister mentioned it to you at any point? Does her fianc\u00e9 maybe have a relative with that name and they\u2019re honouring them? \nI do think you should talk to her but maybe don\u2019t straight up ask her to pick a different name otherwise you\u2019ll get nowhere. Could you say something like \u2018it\u2019s going to be confusing when the baby gets here etc\u2019 and lead into it like that?", "Yta, hundreds of people share the same or similar names. She's doing this to honour someone she loves very much, and you throw it back in her face so rudely? Maybe she should pick a new name but not to appease you, but because it seems you don't seem to appreciate the gravity of a child being named after you.", "YTA.  But what I would do, is pretty much as soon as possible, talk to her and make a light-hearted comment about \"awww, you're naming your baby after me!!  We'll be twinsies!\"  Or something like that.
