You had a bad experience years ago and are still hung up on it but since then you made an agreement to alternate. One party offered an invitation to change this year and instead of an immediate response yes/no 2 months of drama have gone by will they won\u2019t they - third party conversations.   Ridiculous. ESH", "There are so many questions \u2026. Why are y\u2019all still holding on to something that happened 6 years ago? How bad was this situation? Was that the last time you were all together? \n\nWhat\u2019s the issue with telling MIL the plans have changed? Obviously, she still hasn\u2019t decided so now she doesn\u2019t need to. \n\nDo y\u2019all normally plan Christmas in August? \n\nESH (except Moms) \u2014 seems like you & your wife are making this so much harder than it needs to be. If your MIL doesn\u2019t want to hang with your family\u2026. Stop inviting her.", "Ask your mother. Tell her you didn't give your MIL a deadline, and so you don't know if she will be coming - is that a problem?\n\nThen if she says \"yes, that is a problem, I do not want her,\" then you have a problem and is potentially an a\\*\\*hole to one of the ladies, as you have forgotten to keep your mother in the loop about your MIL's indecision.\n\nIf she says \"no, that is not a problem,\" you tell your MIL you really need an answer in a week or so, and get the whole thing out of the world.\n\nIf she says \"no problem, but she needs to respond,\" see above.\n\nPoint is: until your mother can make a decision on whether or not to retract the invitation, you can't make a decision about it. Retracting invitations on behalf of others is a shit move.", "NTA. Honestly, it sounds like your MIL is a bit of a drama queen. So 6 years ago, your mother behaved a bit poorly via text to you (not your MIL). It was her first mother's day after losing her own mum, she was grieving, and she probably needed to spend the day with you, and got upset when you left an arranged meet up with you for your MIL just happening to be in the area. She may not have handled it in the best fashion, but I can see why she was upset, and she was due some grace and understanding. She has since apologised multiple times. \n\nYet your MIL and wife can't get over some text messages (to you, not them) from a grieving woman, 6 years ago, who has apologised multiple times, and all anyone can focus on is that she \"acted like a spoiled toddler\". I feel sorry for your Mum having to deal with this, and don't blame her one bit for rescinding the invitation to someone who can't make up their mind whether to grace her with their presence.", "ESH. \n\nYour mom actually sounds like she sucks the least, in this situation anyway.\n\nYour mom was a brat one day 6 years ago, via texts that presumably were sent only to you, and for which she has since apologized. She gets a pass from me. God help the people around me on the first Mother\u2019s Day without my mom. And fuck them if they can\u2019t extend a bit of grace to a person who\u2019s hurting.\n\nIf the texts were only sent to you then there is no reason for your wife and MIL to even know about them. Maybe you could have told your wife later on when you were alone. But the fact that the outburst had any effect on the MD with wife and MIL at all is 100% your fault. You suck for that.. \n\nWife and MIL both suck for holding this against your grieving mother when it didn\u2019t involve either one of them at all. \n\nMIL sucks for not declining the invitation if she didn\u2019t want to attend. \n\nWife sucks for thinking that it\u2019s perfectly reasonable to just not make a decision for months about a simple family gathering.\n\nI think you need to be the one to tell your MIL that some attendees\u2019 travel plans have changed and your mom regrets she won\u2019t be hosting the dinner she expected to have, and that everyone will get together sometime in the new year.", "You wife and MIL ATA. Go, don't go, but don't keep the hostess in limbo for months and then get annoyed when the plans to which you didn't commit change. Your wife needs to put on her big girl panties and uninvite her mother.", "If your mom has apologized multiple times for something she did SIX YEARS ago while she was grieving the loss of her mother and your MIL still lets it affect her, she\u2019s the AH. Not you or your mom. If people accept an apology, they truly need to let bygones be bygones. NTA", "NTA to be fair 2 months is enough time to give an answer and she clearly has her reservations about going. Maybe this will be the out your MIL wanted but could not find", "Since MIL couldn\u2019t say she was coming after 2 months, the family made other plans.

That\u2019s rude. \n\nNTA.", "My mother acted crazy at my wedding bc we left with my MIL for one hour given she had to fly back home that evening. I\u2019m talking she actually threw our cake over a balcony while we were gone. I chose not to tell my MIL about it. Because what would that solve? It just puts a wedge between families. My question to you is why did you even bother telling your MIL about it? Why would you expect her to want to hang out again after that? I think YTA for telling her about it.", "NTA - If she couldn't decide in two months if she was going or not, then she really didn't want to go in the first place. This should be a non-issue. To be honest, it sounds like all the women involved here are drama queens (Mom, MIL and wife), but at least your mom has apologized multiple times for her drama queen-ness.", "Holding a grudge for 6 years over something so slight is ridiculous.", "YTA for all the telephone tag and your \u201cmindreading\u201d your mother to guess whether or not your MIL is no longer invited to Christmas because your mom refused to invite your sister\u2019s MIL and a bunch of her relatives.. Too much game playing and you, imho, are in the center of it.", "NTA\n\nYou mom is the host and she wants a smaller gathering, this year.  It's out of your hands, and telling your MIL is your wife's job.   That's how it works.", "NTA.  Just keep the families separate. Sounds like that may be best.", "YTA-- for not forgiving your mother for something that happened years ago.\n\n\"My mom was dealing with the loss of my grandmother a few months before and acted ridiculous. She has apologized multiple times since then to myself/my wife and made attempts to make up for it. Not that it changewhat happened\". \n\nI'm sure she's not going to forget her mother died.  And I'm sure it sounds like no one else is letting you forget for being emotional that week.  The week of mother's Day.  \n\nNot saying she should get a free pass but it sounds like she apologized.  A lot.  Not that that changes that she inconvenienced you. How dare she\n\nMake sure your mom knows that neither you, your wife or your mother-in-law have forgiven her for being emotional six years ago.\n\nShe might not have extended the invitation, if she knew that information.\n\nDid your future mother-in-law visit your hometown often?  Not enough of that event is given to as to why You left your mother on the first mother's Day after her mother's death.\n\nAnd in the future if your mother wants to extend any sort of invitation to your wife's side of the family to include an RSVP by date. Then your mother-in-law would know when she needs to respond by to expect to go somewhere for Christmas.  Accommodations do need to be made.", "NTA - all wifey has to do is tell her mom that your mother has changed her mind and decided to keep it small this year and go about your normal Christmas routine.. There's no need in bringing up the past when telling her so I don't see the problem.", "For further clarification my mom did not \u201crescind\u201d any invite. She does not know I even invited my MIL. My mom has been very eager to try and smooth things over & tries to find opportunities to bring everyone together. \n\nKnowing how hesitant my wife and my MIL are I simply replied to her invite (she very casually just suggested the idea) along the lines of \u201cOh yeah, maybe that would be fun\u201d mostly because I knew something like this would happen and didn\u2019t want her feelings hurt\u2026I messed up here, I know. I tried to thread the needle and keep everyone happy regardless of the outcome.\n\nI told my wife that I felt the window for her mom to accept may have passed because in my opinion it may be weird to have my MIL present but not my my sisters. Granted my sisters MIL wants to bring about 6 people total however my sister & BIL also live out of the country and don\u2019t get many holidays with them.\n\nThe Mother\u2019s Day incident was bad, I only told my wife what my mother said but she told my MIL. She\u2019d been drinking but things along the lines of \u201cYou have to choose between them or us\u201d were said and much more. The whole year after my grandmother died was hell to be honest. My mother has now gone to a lot of therapy and has done a lot of work to improve herself, not saying she\u2019s perfect now but she\u2019s much more self aware of toxic tendencies. She specifically wrote my wife a letter apologizing for her behavior and expressing hope they can have a good relationship going forward.", "JFC, wouldn\u2019t it be nice if people could be civil and behave in public. Are you sure you even want to have this dinner? \n\nBut if you have this dinner- so what if a siblings MIL or your wife\u2019s own *mother* show up. What are one or two more plates, really? \n\nESH except for your wife, who will probably be the one in the kitchen trying to make the damn meal happen.", "You\u2019re NTA for keeping your wife informed but you do realise you can\u2019t disinvite your MIL now? That would look very bad.\n\nGo back to your Mum, she\u2019s lacking self awareness in this situation and explain to her how all this random inviting/uninviting/vague comments about smaller events is making her and your family by extension look hostile.", "ESH.\n\nA deadline only works if the responsible party is aware of it. \n\nLiterally all you had to do was give MIL a deadline BEFORE THAT DEADLINE PASSED.\n\nEvery single one of you suck at communication. Feel bad. Y'all did this to yourselves.", "NTA. It doesn't take 2 months to decide if you can make it or not. If MIL was undecided, she should have said, \"Thank you for the invite, but we aren't sure what our plans are going to be yet. Is it okay if we get back to you closer to the day and let you know?\"\n\nAnd to hold a grudge over something trivial from years ago that has been apologized for already? People need to figure out how to move on.", "YTA. Your mom sounds like a mess and somehow that\u2019s your MIL fault", "ESH, especially  your mother. SHE is the one who behaved badly, then invited your MIL and then backed off again. She sounds like a flake.\n\nIf your wife knew her mother was seriously considering it, she could have said so.

From your original post, I assumed it was just your sister\u2019s MIL. Based on that, my response would be that you should have told your mother she needs to just invite both of the MIL and stop shit-stirring. Bringing a whole additional family is a different matter.

When you know she goes full on tantrum it's like \"just mute the phone\". But if it starts out less crazy, then ramps up, will you have made the call to mute the phone before your wife and MIL notice? Would you think to downplay the situation to them? What if they started getting nosey?", "She asked for a Christmas RSVP in August, that is absurd.", "Where did you read that OP\u2019s mom has apologized multiple times and has made it up to them? Per OP, his mom is still causing issues and refuses to move on:\n\n>>My mom can be difficult/a lot with it peaking years ago with this incident. She refuses to move past it and treats any suggestion to as an attack on her feelings.", "Fair point.  And yes OP doesn't make it sound like a work schedule issue.", "But the texts were sent from mother to son, why was wife\u2019s mom ever brought into it?", "ESH - It's been six years though. I think they also all behaved badly back then, too, because it sounds like OP and wife ditched their plans with his grieving mother, on Mother's Day, while visiting *her*, because OP's MIL just happened to be in the same town. They could've tried to invite her as well at the time or said they'd see her the next day/whenever else. His mother behaved badly, too, but it doesn't excuse his MIL and wife behaving badly now over half a decade later.", "Okay I can see that. \n\nFrom my perspective OP is the person who got hell from his Mom & he obviously shared that information with his wife & MIL. It really had nothing to do with them. \n\nIt appears this dinner had the potential to grow in numbers. Perhaps Mom doesn\u2019t have the space to host all those people, maybe can\u2019t afford it or maybe it\u2019s just too much to handle. So to make it fair \u2026. Only immediate family is invited. That\u2019s really not a big deal. Seems very simple to me. \n\nIf wife wants to paint OP\u2019s Mom as an ah then that\u2019s what she will do. If they want to believe that Mom changed all these plans to create issues then that\u2019s what they will do. People have choices. Turn it into a big drama or just move on with life & don\u2019t make it personal.", "I can say with 100% certainty that I would never have told MIL or Wife what the texts were about. Maybe Wife later on, so it wouldn\u2019t affect the outing. \n\nI\u2019m not sure why it would matter whether MIL and Wife noticed that OP was getting texts before hypothetically silencing the phone. If OP didn\u2019t tell them what was going on to begin with why would that even register with them? Do you ask people why they\u2019re getting texts and what the messages are about if their phone happens to vibrate in your presence?\n\nThese were TEXT MESSAGES. Mom didn\u2019t show up and have a tanty in front of everyone. OP didn\u2019t say that she was sending them to the entire group. If she was messaging her son exclusively she had no reason to think that anything she said was going to become conversation fodder that would follow her for half a decade.", "It\u2019s pretty common for some families.  Holiday decisions are made far in advance for us.\n\nBut if MIL thought it was crazy early the polite thing to do would give a timeline for her response instead of ignoring the invite for 2 months", "It\u2019s literally in the post, read it. \u201cShe has apologized multiple times since them to myself/my wife and made attempts to make up for it.\u201d Nowhere does it state she is still acting up, if anything, she sounds embarrassed by her behavior.", "Because OP told his then girlfriend who then decided to tell her mom and helped create this drama.", "If someone close to me kept pulling out their phone and texting during a period where I wouldn't expect them to then yes, I may ask if something was the matter.", "That\u2019s wild. My family is for sure a \u201cone thing at a time\u201d type family. We hash out Christmas plans at Thanksgiving.", "Try rereading the other commenters post. OP states that the mom acts up, it\u2019s not in my head, it\u2019s literally written per the OP. Good grief lol", "Why would you be responding at all? That puts this hypothetical scenario in a completely different light. \n\nIf I started getting ranting messages like the ones OP was apparently receiving from his mom I wouldn\u2019t answer, just silence her texts and keep it moving. \n\nCan you tell I\u2019ve been in this situation before \ud83e\udd23", "Do you all live relatively close? No one in my family is normally a planner but we're all spread across the continent. We need to make Xmas plans pretty much the year before so that everyone's time off and travel arrangements match up.", "If it was that important, he should have put in the post. That\u2019s what I\u2019m going on, I\u2019m not going to read 77 replies. Some of these posts get 2000 replies. I\u2019m not gonna read through all that.", "Lol ok"]}
