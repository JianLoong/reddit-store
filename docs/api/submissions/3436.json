Either suck it up and be miserable with your family/brother or get a spine and have a wonderful Xmas with you and hubby. \nI mean seriously, what on earth are you expecting people to say? It\u2019s very black and white.", "It seems like visiting is a form of self flagellation. Your parents and brother don't care you see you and enjoy being cruel to you, so why are you doing it? You need therapy to learn how to not be their punching bag.", "I understand completely. I have several niblings and I\u2019ve had to wake up early to watch them open gifts for years and I feel dead inside. It\u2019s not fun and they honestly get a lot of gifts. Maybe if it was a special gift like Xbox or a car. NTA \n\nDo you really want to spend time with a family who has unreasonable demands? Yes waking up that early is unreasonable \ud83d\ude34", "ESH I think it's unreasonable to expect you to wake up at the crack of dawn like that.  On the other hand your attitude towards your nephew is kind of gross, it's not his fault if his dad is an AH.  I'm not Christian but I've seen enough movies and lived in a majority Christian country long enough to understand that if there are small kids in the family Christmas is probably going to revolve around them, presents and Santa and cookies and decorations and magic are just fun at that age.  If you don't like that don't go or at least don't stay in the house with a young kid.  Your nephew is a person too in his own right now just an extension of you brother or a puppy or something but a full human being so keep that in mind.", "ESH.  It\u2019s unreasonable to expect you to get up at 5am but it\u2019s also unreasonable for you to skip it entirely.  It would be a fair compromise to do presents all together at say 7am.  It feels,like you are projecting your feelings about your brother onto his son which isnt  fair. I am literally estranged from one of my nieces who has a stepson with her girlfriend.  I have not and will never treat that child poorly because his parents are assholes.  To her credit, she has not spoken bad about me to him as he knows who I am and is quite fond of me when we are all at the same family function.  We seem to have a mutual unspoken agreement that our issues are not to be projected onto a 5 year old.  Time to make some new traditions and do something else for the holidays if you cannot put your issues with your brother aside for one day.", "Yta. You are the ahole because you are forcing yourselves to go to these events that make you miserable then trying to force others to change how they want to do things. Your parents aren't even very nice to you. It's like you want to victimize you and your husband. Don't go. Explain that it's not difficult to schedule gift opening an hour or two later and you'd rather be rested. If they want you there bad enough they'll let you sleep in or something will change. But yta for shoving yourselves into unnecessary drama and exhaustion. It's the definition of insanity. You keep doing the same thing every year expecting people to change.", "WHAT?? Nothing at 5/6am is mandatory except maybe showing up to a court hearing. OP is NTA. \n\nHow dare they demand someone's presence at that ungodly time. \n\nOP, ignore these people. You are not the asshole for opting out of something that early. Its not like you are telling them to wait for you, they are free to do as they please and you will join later. \n\nI don't know if they are getting off on trying to exert control over you or what but do not feel bad about telling them to manage their own feelings, do what they want to do for your lovely young nephew, and let you worry about how long you sleep. FFS.", "This.", "> Hotel^Hotel", "I agree. There is no reason that the child cannot be taught to wait until a reasonable hour to open presents. Or, that you can't just skip watching the kid open presents if your brother insists upon opening gifts at 5am.  My parents had a rule that we could only opening our stocking before my grandparents arrived and they came at the reasonable hour of 830.", "I agree.

My parents had a rule that we could only opening our stocking before my grandparents arrived and they came at the reasonable hour of 830.", "My mom always hung the stockings on my brother and I\u2019s doors filled with little goodies. This way we could open that first thing when we woke up! We\u2019d be preoccupied with our stocking stuffers till the adults woke up and were ready to open the gifts under the tree", "We can all agree on that but it will not change how OP\u2019s brother parents", "Agree. ESH. \nI cringed a bit when I read that. You have no relationship with\u2026 he\u2019s your nephew ffs. If you have kids one day you wouldn\u2019t want for them to be referred this way - I usually hate this type of sentences but It applies here. I see / read many adults who refer to kids as if they were full grown adults. They aren\u2019t!\nYour brother on the other hand expects too much and sure as hell the kid wouldn\u2019t notice who s there and who isn\u2019t.", "I get you. But I would do what the commenter above suggested. If you stay there, you WILL be woken up. No matter what you do to try to sleep in, your brother or parents will not let you sleep. Even locking the bedroom door won't work- they'll just bang on it till you get up. And if you don't surface, prepare for the rest of your day to be made into a living hell.", "Stay with extended family. That way your ahole brother won\u2019t nudge you out of the family. You need to talk to your parents because they allow your brother to make you feel less than when they take his side. If they already know how you feel, focus on people who deserve your time.", "Is the extended family coming over for Christmas dinner? Perhaps you puke say you have a work meeting come up and you will drive in on Christmas morning? Get there at noon, ready for dinner and the extended family?", "OP, you say your problem is with your brother but your parents are the hosts and they are already angry that you want to sleep in. Waking up early to watch someone else open presents (how long will it take?) sounds like unnecessary torture. \n\nI remember being a kid and waking up early and having to wait for our parents to get up. I'm pretty sure the folks had the coffee going before they were ready to watch us. staring at the gifts and wondering what they were was part of the excitement. \n\nI mean, you could always agree to get up and then sleep in anyways.", "5am?! Fuck that. What they going to do, drag you out of bed? Just say 'lol absolutely no way. I categorically forbid you from waking me up at that time.'", "Same and we ate breakfast first.", "The thing is depending on the kids age you're just setting yourself up for years of this. Can you attend service near home and then make the drive and join your family for dinner?", "You're never going to get that Christmas feeling your chasing, because your brother is the golden child and your parents allow it. Look up Einstein's theory of insanity.", "Can\u2019t you just drink a lot. \n\nAnd then just don\u2019t wake up. \n\nLock the doors and chill\u2026 \n\nOr sneak out at night and stay at a hotel before returning 25th morning.", "FYI that nephew is family", "That doesn't make her the asshole. Her parents and brother are still the assholes in the situation; she's just slow in accepting that they are assholes, which is understandable.", "OP is NTA but that\u2019s not going to change the reality of the situation.", "My kids did 5:00 one year and it was ridiculous, but it was just we who spawned them in attendance. To ask that of other people is totally outrageous.", " Only your own actions. Your parents have shown they will side with your brother everytime.", "This is what I do and honestly it's made holidays so much better", "This comment should be higher.  I hope OP sees it.  I completely agree.  OP will not get the Christmas they want, and the sooner they come to peace with that, the happier they will be in the long run as they make suitable adjustments.", "Ah, yes ESH I will change my vote.", "Visit your parents on another weekend, new years or after the new year.  Your parents are shitty because they enable your brother.", "You said its a 5 hour drive. How about a hotel thats an hour away so you can do most of the drive the night before, then an hour in the morning and show up when you want?", "If you have extended family in the area (and there's an implied yes, as you expect to see them for Christmas dinner but don't mention them traveling in) can you stay with a different family member?", "Go for a cheap motel? They suck, but you're not going to be there to enjoy it anyway.\n\nI wouldn't do motels for an extended stay if I can help it, but for just a night or two when the place I'm spending more time at is somewhere else? Being able to sleep might be worth the drop in quality.", "Consider Airbnb."]}
