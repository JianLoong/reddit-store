Everyone would then be hungry and wanting coffee.\n\nIt would be too early to call up little friends and show off toys.\n\nThe only way I could see this work for everybody is to hold a Christmas watch party for the adults, neighbors included, then have all the kiddos unwrap gifts while the adults watch.

No amount of pushing will make these people change. They are all adults who are capable of choosing whom to prioritize. They do not and will not prioritize you. They will not listen to you because they do not want to. Your brother isn\u2019t the issue. Your enabling parents are.

At the crack of dawn if that is when gifts are opened. That is what I believe and how I voted. You are fine to feel differently.", "Yeah that's bonkers. When i was a kid we were allowed to take our stockings to our room at whatever ungodly hour we woke up, but presents didn't happen until after breakfast.", "Potentially - but the hotels in my parents area are extremely expensive and really out of my budget.", "Whoop! There it is! \n\nI feel like a lot of us at this age are just chasing the holiday magic we felt as kids, but it's not the same at all.", "So it\u2019s just like any other strong relationship, then?", "It can go either way.  My sister (whose house we stayed at last year) understood and didnt want to make us uncomfortable which we immensely appreciated.  We knew they would wake up early so we slept with ear plugs.  Kids have energy to run around all day even waking up that early.  Adults, not so much.  \n\nLike OP we traveled and got there the night before. We wanted to sleep in a bit.  If not, I might have told my sister we would make other arrangements for where we would sleep on xmas eve night."]}
