So saying, \"just have close friends that aren't family\" seems a little reductive to me; you can do both and should encourage it for your kids if you reasonably can. I mean, I have very close friends that are closer to me than even my sister, but my life is richer for the fact that I am also close to her. Likewise for my cousins.\n\nGood family can give you more knowledge than friends; your friends have been selected for interests similar to your own and behaviors you personally like. If you have a brother or cousin you love but don't like as much, they might expose you to different ideas, behaviors, and interests that you would never select for in a friend, but give you understanding in subjects you never would have gotten from selected friends.\n\nOf course some families are toxic and this is impossible.

Alternatively, if you are able and willing to spare a vacation day, find a slow time at work during the year for you and your spouse to take a Monday and/or Friday off to go visit family.  The bonus can be that if this is not a regular holiday time, it may be easier traveling and less stressful to you too.  Take that weekend off annually and alternate that between your families.
