What I am reading is that you and your wife are each doing a risk-analysis on the situation and coming up with different results. Your wife thinks the chance of her sister getting murdered is high, and her chance of helping is her sister change is high, and the chance of your girls getting hurt is low. You think the chance of helping the SIL to change is zero-none and the chance of your girls getting hurt is much higher.  \n\n\nUnfortunately, no one has a crystal ball and the chances of your girls getting hurt or the sister getting murdered are entirely dependent on some psycho's behavior, which you cannot control. My only suggestion is that if you are drawing a line about her staying you HAVE to come up with alternative solutions, because at the end of the day both you and your wife are looking at the situation and thinking that SOMEONE is at risk of being hurt, so you should treat this very very seriously. If you do that then NTA.", "I think we need more info. \n\nIs the bf a toxic prick who manipulates and mentally abuses your SIL? Or is he violent and an immediate threat to her and others? By your description I\u2019d say the latter. \n\nYou\u2019re NTA by default as you have your own self and family to look after. However, if your SIL is in immediate danger and you and your wife are her only lifelines, I would think to you have to do something. \n\nIs getting her a hotel/motel (with him not knowing where) for a night or two a possibility?\n\nEither way, she needs to leave his ass.", " I see both sides. I can understand you wanting to protect your kids over all else. At the same time your wife has a loved one who could be in danger that he wants to help. \n\nI don\u2019t think either of you are wrong? I personally would think I would also protect my kids over a sibling but that\u2019s just me\n\nNAH", "NTA. Abusers often escalate violence and threats just as a partner is getting ready to leave so your concern isn't unfounded. These dudes are mostly dangerous to their partners but they catch co-workers and the police in the crossfire all the time- single most dangerous type of calls police respond to. \n\nThat said, it normally takes multiple tries for a woman to get out of an abusive relationship. They've been brainwashed and coerced and beaten down so low it's not reasonable to expect them to function like you would. Get on the phone with the family and scrape up enough contributions to find her emergency housing- in a shelter if need be. \n\nHelp her call the [https://www.thehotline.org/plan-for-safety/](https://www.thehotline.org/plan-for-safety/) to make a safety plan.", "NTA.\n\nYour first responsibility is and always will be to the safety of your kids. Help in other ways if you are able, but domestic situations are extremely dangerous to anyone in the midst. It's hard to say no in that situation, but you are doing the right thing. I wonder why your wife is not more concerned about inviting that danger around the children. She probably knows it deep down, but it's her sister, and maybe you're just kinda getting scapegoated a little here.", "NTA. You are right to prioritize your daughters' safety. She is the adult who made choices with consequences, they are innocent bystanders who shouldn't be brought into those possible consequences. If your wife wants to help her sister, she can help by paying for a hotel room (or finding a DV women's shelter). \n\nOne thing, though. If he knows where you live, he might just show up at your house anyway looking for her. Even if she's not there, she may be putting you all in danger if this man is as unstable as you fear.", "I wouldn\u2019t want that drama on my doorstep either. Your SIL is grown, what about your MIL can she help? OP is right because they\u2019ve got 2 children of their own that their safety will always come first. Your SIL has been dating this AH for 5 years, so we all know how this plays out. They fight, she leaves, he says sorry, he won\u2019t be doing it again, she takes his sorry ass back. BUT you can help her without taking her in. Put her up in a hotel/motel for a couple of days so she can get her bearings together. She can be welcome to come over, as she would need support from her family, but then she needs to go back to her hotel/motel room. NTA.", "NAH\n\nIf your wife and SIL are seriously concernedthis guy will murder your SIL, that is very serious and needs to be handled ASAP.\nYour concern shows you also believe he's capable.\n\nYour wife absolutely wants to and needs to help her sister. Especially if the sister is ready to leave this time.\n\nI absolutely understand your concern about safety for your daughters if he were to come there. Why wouldn't he? And that's scary. \n\nBoth sides have valid points. \n\n\nYour wife and SIL should pursue a restraining order, get rid of her phone for tracking and get out of town or something. Or post up with another friend or family member. \n\nI'm not sure what the right answer is but I do think protecting your daughter's should be number one. There are options", "If your wife is scared that her sister might not last the week bc of this guy, she\u2019s actually solidifying your point. If he knows where you live, and he is that dangerous, your SIL is putting you all at risk. She can stay, but then you and your daughters have to go (or she can leave and your wife is going to be pissed). Your wife has to choose: her sister or her husband and daughters. NTA", "If she isn't leaving or being forced out, then I think it's time to discuss a restraining order with SIL. She will not want to hear it, so either she'll leave or she'll eventually cave. I feel like this is the time to have an intervention, but your wife needs to be on board so SIL will listen. In the meantime, discussing a restraining order is good, if not for her, then your family. If he knows where you live, that is an immenent danger to your family, and if there was an incident, you can get a restraining order for your family. NTA", "NTA, this screams episode of 48 hours, her problems do not outweigh the safety of two teenagers.", "Maybe your SIL should make better choices when it comes to men. No offense intended,  but it\u2019s beyond the pale that your wife expects this of you. Your family would be at risk for terrible choices SIL is making. You are totally NTA. People have gone a lil crazy in the world and this could end badly.", "NTA. SIL continues to go back and put herself in danger. These situations typically tend to escalate.  If you can financially do so, offer to pay for a few nights for a hotel but until SIL make a serious attempt to end it with that loser you will not support her if she goes back yet again.", "NtAH - your sil makes stupid choices - repeatedly and that could in fact endanger you and your daughters so you have every right to say only for the night - then sort it out yourself.  The sil is not a kid but your daughters are.  Dateline alone has dozens of dozens of stories just about this type of abuse situation that turns ugly fast.", "YTA. \n\nYour sister in law is family and she needs help. \n\nYour logic doesn't even make sense. You are worried that her boyfriend will come looking for her putting your family in danger. You do realize that he can come looking for her whether she is staying with you or not, right? Having her stay elsewhere won't make you, her, or your kids any safer.", "Soft YTA.\n\nI get it, it's a potentially dangerous situation you're trying to spare your daughters from. \n\nHowever, that's your wife's sister. If you boot her out, and something tragic happens to her, your wife will blame you for the rest of your marriage. Also, the lesson you're setting up for your daughters is kinda sucky. \"I care about you girls, but Auntie is in a bad situation, domestic violence is bad and shouldn't be tolerated until it comes to my doorstep. If she dies, oh well. And if this happens to you, don't bug your sister with it. She has a family to look out for.\"\n\nIt takes so much for someone to actually leave a DV situation. Victims and survivors try to go somewhere safe, and she sees you and her sister as safe. You want to take away that safety. Also, it's a few days, not permanent. If he shows up, call the cops.", "NAH", "I understand wanting to get her sister out of harms way and offering the emergency shelter and your pov about the safety of your daughters.  \n\nYour she needs be gone asap is a little harsh and not really considering how your wife feels.  I am certain she is concerned for your daughters, too, AND for her sister, who can't seem to get out of her own way.\n\nHow about trying to find a hotel or domestic abuse resources in the area to help offer an alternative solution instead of just kicking the sister out without a plan??  \n\nI am leaning towards a soft YTA here.

Exclusively for the fact that if you think he's going to come there to find the sister, he's coming whether she's there or not. It's not hard to hide the evidence of her being there to keep everyone involved safe. \n\nIn the meantime, you could tell her that she can only stay if she makes a police report (if it's serious enough) or proves that she's blocked him on all forms of communication.\n\nOtherwise, your wife is protecting her sister. You can't really be mad at her for that. It's an admirable trait that a lot of people don't have.", "ESH\n\nYou do realize that regardless of where your SIL stays, crazy bf is going to think she is with you, right?

I would argue that the sister is a soft YTA cuz she\u2019s taught her bf that he can treat her like crap and she\u2019ll stay with him. Now that may affect ops children.

So she isn't to blame for being treated badly, but she's to blame for being with him at all.", "It takes an average of ten times before a woman successfully leaves an abusive man. The manipulative tactics abusive men use is unreal!", "You have no idea how little choice people have in these situations. I\u2019ve worked with a lot of women who were kept financially unable to leave, women who are too afraid to leave because they\u2019ll be killed if they get caught, women who are told that their children will be harmed or removed from them if they leave, women who were physically restrained from leaving, or threatened into returning. Women who\u2019d been so broken down that they\u2019d go back because they no longer believed that they deserve better, after years of belittling and being told it\u2019s their fault. One woman had a husband who took *her clothes* so she wouldn\u2019t be able to leave the house at all. \n\nThere are a million nasty ways that bad people can keep someone to themselves, and it\u2019s unhelpful to suggest that people should just leave. It\u2019s dangerous and sometimes impossible, and it can take years for an opportunity to leave safely and successfully to present itself. If there was a 15% chance that you\u2019d be beaten to death if you left your house today, would you still want to go outside? Probably not. If you thought there was a 75% chance that you\u2019d be beaten to death if you leave a relationship (or if you don\u2019t return), you\u2019d probably think quite seriously about what the safest option was. \n\nAll this to say, you really shouldn\u2019t judge so quickly or harshly when it comes to abusive relationships, there are so many reasons why someone might be unable to successfully break free. It costs nothing to refrain from victim blaming, and you really stand to gain nothing by making abuse victims feel small.", "NTA, you are in the right to protect your children.

You have every reason to be concerned for your family's safety.   If this man is as crazy as you described,  then even if SIL is not at your house, your family may still be in danger.  Abusers tend to go to the closest family or friends that they think are hiding their target.  They are just as likely to turn violent with family, just to hurt their intended target.  Basically, your family could be in danger just by knowing this guy's target.\n\nPersonally, I would tell wife and SIL that this is her one chance.  She has to take the necessary steps to remove this man from her life permanently; press charges, file a protective order, cut all contact with him, etc.  Providing she does all of this, you guys will help in whatever way you can, but if she goes back or continues contact in any way that's it, your done, you will not allow their craziness to hurt your daughters.", "NTA.

There are lots of people who don't stay with family for this reason, and also because it makes it easier to find her so it's less safe for her too. \n\nI agree with what others have said about trying to be as supportive as possible otherwise, though. For ex help her as much as you can with finding somewhere to go, emphasize that you're concerned about her safety as well as the safety of your family. Supporting her as much as possible may help prevent her from going back to the relationship, but also know that this is really really hard for survivors to do. Also know that you're not to blame if she does go back. I know its hard to understand, but try to avoid judging her for the times they have gotten back together, there are soooo many barriers and reasons behind this. \n\nA shelter may be helpful because there's usually security features and caseworkers who can support her with making a long term plan for housing, etc. I know it doesn't sound ideal but they can be much nicer than people expect, can't speak for your area but may be an option to look into. \n\nLook up your local or national domestic violence shelter/organization and find/ask for safety planning info for her.

A condition of her staying would be her going completely no contact, not informing her where is staying and the above legal actions. \n\nI would ask your wife if she was so worried about his sister would she insist on the above as condition to not only keep her safe but the rest of HER family, her daughter, her husband and herself!\n\nAny resumption of contact or a relationship with him would means she has to leave and if he turned up at your house the police would be called.\n\nNTA, but I would let her stay under the above conditions.", "NTA. Your fear is valid and SIL needs to take care of herself and stop going back to that asshole.", "NTA, OMG your wife cares about her sister's safety but not that of her daughters.  She does not think her sister will survive the week but what about her own kids?  Get an AIRBNB or VBRO for a week. Get them to safety.  Do not tell your wife where you are staying.    If that does not wake her up tell her, you and your daughters will be moving out.  Not only is there the danger of her BF but when she does go back and forth from your home to her BF your daughters will start to see this as a normal relationship that will also lead to danger.", "Think about it this way - would you hope someday if one if your girls (god forbid) was in your SILs shoes\u2026 your other daughter would take her?  No matter what.", "NTA", "I see the thoughtful top comments. I can only tell you that I wouldn't let my own sister - anybody - put my children in danger. Your SIL has had an on-off relationship with this dangerous person for 5 years. She may, once again, even take him back. Will he be mad that your family allowed her to hide out from him for the days it took before she caved again?\n\nYour wife can try to think of safe options for her sister; she can ask you for ideas and help. But she cannot unilaterally decide that her sister's welfare counts more than your family's welfare. That she can take in a very risky person without your consent.", "NTA - I really feel for you here but I think you should stick to your guns. I'm sure there are other options for sister in the not immediate.", "This has happened multiple times already and the sister always gets back with the asshole boyfriend. I would not want to risk the safety of my household because of her very poor decisions.", "Also, if this guy is dangerous the sister's house is probably going to be one of the first places he'll look for her, so they are at risk whether she's there or not. They need to work together to come up with a plan.", "He\u2019s concerned for the safety of himself and the girls. I agree with you, I think that description fits the latter.", "No one chooses to be abused.", "The victim blame here is astonishing", "Not okay to victim blame. No one chooses to be abused.", "The ones in my state are helping women get temporary shelter at hotels and help them get set up with more permanent housing resources. Even if they can't shelter her, it's 100% worth it to call to get SIL a case worker and on the list for resources *in case* this time she leaves for real. Maybe being empowered by a supportive family and bolstered with resources and professional help it will give her the push needed to get out. Not to imply OP has to house her indefinitely, but maybe they could help?", "The shelter also offers counseling to help victims of DV that they are worthwhile and do not deserve the abuse, it helps them understand that no matter what the abuser tells them it is not their fault they were abused.", "This is the way.", "Correct. That is why it is imperative to make a police report each time there is a violation of a restraining order. The more police reports, the more the District Attorney\u2019s office gets involved. The more police reports, the more likely a temporary restraining order is given a longer end date and higher restrictions. It\u2018s the crying baby getting the most attention in order for the police and the prosecutors to take matters more seriously.", "NTA. You are within your right to protect your children. Your wife should respect your input and prioritize her kids over her adult sister who keeps going back to that situation of her own free will.", "NTA - maybe you can put her up in a motel or something like that. It\u2019s not like her being at your place offers her extra protection over a motel. I get where your wife is coming from but she\u2019s clearly not thinking of her own kids", "NAH, but I work with DV survivors. If my sister was in a DV situation and my husband refused to help me protect her, we'd have a family day at the courthouse\u2014a restraining order for her and a divorce for me. But then again, that's why I didn't marry someone who didn't think of my sister as their own.\n\nThat's your sister-in-law, your daughters' aunt. You think your marriage is going to survive this, especially if the guy is as dangerous as you think and manages to harm your SIL if you make her leave? \n\nWould you want one of your own daughters to turn her sister away in this situation? What would you think of their future spouse if they had the same response as you did, and you weren't able to protect your daughter yourself? Is that a guy you'd welcome into your family and consider a son?\n\nI don't think you're going to end up looking good here unless you can offer an alternate way to help your family stay safe\u2014your whole family, including SIL.", "Okay, I need INFO here: does the boyfriend know where she is because if he doesn't there no reason she can't stay there for an extended period of time. I think imposing the 24-hour thing is completely unsympathetic to your sister's situation. On average, it takes 7 attempts before leaving an abuser for good, and being turned away by willing and capable family members is what lands them in shelters or back with their exes. Speaking of your daughters' safety, is this how you would want them to be treated if they were in a similar situation? If the boyfriend doesn't know where you are, what is the harm of letting her stay until she can find a more suitable living arrangement? I understand being concerned for your girls, and you're an excellent father for that, but a simple way to mitigate the risks would have been to reiterate safety rules like no opening the door to strangers under any circumstances, no going with people that mom and dad haven't added to the pick up list *and* told you that they would pick you up etc. \n\nI think the particularly assholey part of this is the 24h time limit. That's not enough time to do anything, and it lets your sister in law know that you think that her being the victim of an abusive relationship is a huge inconvenience for you (which is totally can be, but it helps no one to articulate that).", "My parents sheltered my aunt when her then-husband got physical. The next day he showed up at my house with a bang stick and the police had to be called. I was 10 and even then I was under no illusions that he would end us all to get to her. \n\nNTA, OP. Your wife needs a reality check.", "Alot of us are missing the part where OP says she keeps going back to him. Restraining orders and DV shelters don't matter when the sister ends back up with him. The daughters don't deserve to see their aunt go back and forth with this crazy man. Looks like she has help if she wants to leave him and keep it like that -- but If she keeps going back, how many times is OPs family obligated to put their lives at risk?\n\nNTA\n\nSource: lived this life with father in law and his abusive wife, until we went NC for our own sanity after years of back and forth trying to help him, and him returning to her.", "NAH, but you two or you three, to include SIL in the conversation, need to find a long-term solution to her situation. Her bf might be looking for her at your place anyway as it would be the most likely place SIL would go. If he's as crazy as you describe him, it wouldn't matter where SIL would be staying, she might as well be staying with you for a few days and play dumb when eventually the bf comes looking.", "Nta, but tell her your house is the first place he will look first.", "NAH - I understand where both you and your wife are coming from\u2026 but for your own peace of mind it might be a good idea to do a safety plan with your family and practice it, in the event that the perpetrator continues to escalate and does rock up at your house looking for SIL.", "If your SIL is really in danger your wife is in the wrong and acting really irresponsible bringing her around your kids. You're not the police. You can't stop a persom from hurting,murdering your SIL. You're not the one who should be reached out in case of danger. You and your wife should put your kids before anyone. I'm 21,don't even have kids but I already know how priorities change once you have a child. They should become your sole concern.", "Even if she leaves he may show up at your house. Got cameras?  NTA", "NTA in any way. If there are worries about her sister's safety then for everyone's sake - you, your family, and your sister-in-law - then she needs to be in a domestic violence shelter.  \n\n\nI don't want to repeat statistics or awful stories but will just say that I really hope your wife can accept that a shelter is the safest and best option for all concerned here. I very much hope that all of you take this seriously and don't try to convince yourselves that just crashing at your house if there's potential danger is a good idea. For everyone's sake please seek shelter services.", "NTA... there are safe homes for this.", "NTA honestly SIL is allowing this behavior if she keeps taking him back and you\u2019re right in protecting your daughters. Your wife is being 100% unreasonable!", "NTA.  Innocent children don\u2019t need to be involved in your SIL\u2019s domestic disaster.  Also, I find it surprising your wife values her sister\u2019s safety more than her own childrens.  I love my siblings, but not enough to risk the safety of my young children.", "NAH. \n\nThis situation is way beyond Reddit's payroll, so take everything said here with a grain of salt. This involves the safety of your loved ones. Talk to your wife and sister on how they want to proceed. Definitely encourage going to the police.", "NAH\n\nI'm on your side with prioritizing your children. I can't fault your wife for being scared for her sister. \n\nSince her sister is only planning to be with you guys a few days (what's the plan after that?) put her up in a hotel room. Are there domestic violence shelters? Who else does she know in the area? And like others pointed out, be prepared for the possibility that you might be in danger even if she isn't with you.", "Yea that\u2019s my thoughts too, if he\u2019s dangerous enough to kill her then why would you want that potentially occurring in your own home with your children present", "I would worry that he might show up even if she is not there. Depending on how crazy he is, he may assume that she is hiding there. He could also assume that your wife would know where your SIL is.\n\nHave a couple of emergency plans laid out so your family knows what to do if the boyfriend shows up.", "Preach.  Kids > wife > sister in law.", "A restraining order would give him their address and prove the sister's family was helping her, but would do absolutely nothing to keep him from showing up with a gun or climbing through a window.", "This is exactly what happened when my aunt ran away from her abusive husband. She came to my house where my parents sheltered her, and our house was the first place he looked. Showed up with a bang stick and had to have the police come and arrest him. He would have ended all of us to get to her. I was 10 years old and terrified.", "All of my googling contradicts that.  The court needs a mailing address, but that's it.  it shows that on the USA & Au sites I have checked.\n\nUpdated: March 17, 2022\r  \nDo I have to provide my address to file for an order?\r  \nIf providing your address would put you or your family members at risk of further abuse, you do not have to reveal your address in your petition. However, you must provide an address where you can receive mail so that you can be served with any court paperwork", "OP, you should definitely anticipate the boyfriend showing up at your place. Even if your SIL isn't there, it will probably be on a short list of places boyfriend will look for her.\n\nIf you have an alarm, set it. If you don't have an alarm, consider what safety features you do have and which ones you should maybe get.", "If you want to bar him from the property, you have to say what property. If it's just to stay away from her and he shows up, the restraining order does absolutely nothing unless you can prove he knows she's there. So it's give the address he has to stay away from, or admit she's there if he shows up. Otherwise, he's not violating the restraining order when he shows up on the doorstep.", "In some states there is a difference between a restraining order and a protection order. In these states, a protection order us what you want. Source: volunteered at a women's shelter.", "okay and when the violation is the murder? \n\nrestraining orders have a disturbing correlation to murder.", "Correlation could be because the level of violence in a relationship merited a protective order in the first place and/or protective orders are usually sought when the person is fleeing which is the riskiest time in a DV relationship. This is simply not reason enough to disregard a restraining order. I mean, its only one tool so it's not necessarily going to solve everything but it can be helpful if he begins engaging in any menacing behavior. One client was able to put away her abuser because there was an individual charge for each text message from him and his family blowing up her phone. She slept well knowing he's going to be away for several months.\n\nThe absolute biggest indicators of future homicide in a DV relationship is access to a gun, previous threats with a weapon and previous non fatal strangulation. Strangulation, the risk jumps up especially if they strangle til unconsciousness which is why strangulation usually goes straight to aggravated domestic violence charge. The riskiest time for violence is when someone leaves their partner. So if she fled because of a threat with a gun, he still has it, and shes trying to flee, get the protective order. It's state specific for laws protecting addresses but there's a number of programs in my state that seal the address even after the protective order but any allegations of abuse are shared and you do have to attend the hearings and recount the abuse to get the restraining order which can be traumatizing. \n\nBut NAH, if an abuser has shown they don't give a fuck about someone, they surely aren't going to give a fuck about that person's nieces. I feel for the sister since I'd feel the exact same way but you are not wrong whatsoever. If she can't stay safe at home, what exactly could yall provide that would keep her safe? Can she go to a shelter? I'd start calling places for services for her.", "the idea is that police will intervene before that if the violations are on their radar but we all know how *that* goes"]}
