What I am reading is that you and your wife are each doing a risk-analysis on the situation and coming up with different results. Your wife thinks the chance of her sister getting murdered is high, and her chance of helping is her sister change is high, and the chance of your girls getting hurt is low. You think the chance of helping the SIL to change is zero-none and the chance of your girls getting hurt is much higher.  \n\n\nUnfortunately, no one has a crystal ball and the chances of your girls getting hurt or the sister getting murdered are entirely dependent on some psycho's behavior, which you cannot control. My only suggestion is that if you are drawing a line about her staying you HAVE to come up with alternative solutions, because at the end of the day both you and your wife are looking at the situation and thinking that SOMEONE is at risk of being hurt, so you should treat this very very seriously. If you do that then NTA.", "I think we need more info. \n\nIs the bf a toxic prick who manipulates and mentally abuses your SIL? Or is he violent and an immediate threat to her and others? By your description I\u2019d say the latter. \n\nYou\u2019re NTA by default as you have your own self and family to look after. However, if your SIL is in immediate danger and you and your wife are her only lifelines, I would think to you have to do something. \n\nIs getting her a hotel/motel (with him not knowing where) for a night or two a possibility?\n\nEither way, she needs to leave his ass.", " I see both sides. I can understand you wanting to protect your kids over all else. At the same time your wife has a loved one who could be in danger that he wants to help. \n\nI don\u2019t think either of you are wrong? I personally would think I would also protect my kids over a sibling but that\u2019s just me\n\nNAH", "NTA. Abusers often escalate violence and threats just as a partner is getting ready to leave so your concern isn't unfounded. These dudes are mostly dangerous to their partners but they catch co-workers and the police in the crossfire all the time- single most dangerous type of calls police respond to. \n\nThat said, it normally takes multiple tries for a woman to get out of an abusive relationship. They've been brainwashed and coerced and beaten down so low it's not reasonable to expect them to function like you would. Get on the phone with the family and scrape up enough contributions to find her emergency housing- in a shelter if need be. \n\nHelp her call the [https://www.thehotline.org/plan-for-safety/](https://www.thehotline.org/plan-for-safety/) to make a safety plan.", "NTA.\n\nYour first responsibility is and always will be to the safety of your kids. Help in other ways if you are able, but domestic situations are extremely dangerous to anyone in the midst. It's hard to say no in that situation, but you are doing the right thing. I wonder why your wife is not more concerned about inviting that danger around the children. She probably knows it deep down, but it's her sister, and maybe you're just kinda getting scapegoated a little here.", "NTA. You are right to prioritize your daughters' safety. She is the adult who made choices with consequences, they are innocent bystanders who shouldn't be brought into those possible consequences. If your wife wants to help her sister, she can help by paying for a hotel room (or finding a DV women's shelter). \n\nOne thing, though. If he knows where you live, he might just show up at your house anyway looking for her. Even if she's not there, she may be putting you all in danger if this man is as unstable as you fear.", "I wouldn\u2019t want that drama on my doorstep either. Your SIL is grown, what about your MIL can she help? OP is right because they\u2019ve got 2 children of their own that their safety will always come first. Your SIL has been dating this AH for 5 years, so we all know how this plays out. They fight, she leaves, he says sorry, he won\u2019t be doing it again, she takes his sorry ass back. BUT you can help her without taking her in. Put her up in a hotel/motel for a couple of days so she can get her bearings together. She can be welcome to come over, as she would need support from her family, but then she needs to go back to her hotel/motel room. NTA.", "NAH\n\nIf your wife and SIL are seriously concernedthis guy will murder your SIL, that is very serious and needs to be handled ASAP.\nYour concern shows you also believe he's capable.\n\nYour wife absolutely wants to and needs to help her sister. Especially if the sister is ready to leave this time.\n\nI absolutely understand your concern about safety for your daughters if he were to come there. Why wouldn't he? And that's scary. \n\nBoth sides have valid points. \n\n\nYour wife and SIL should pursue a restraining order, get rid of her phone for tracking and get out of town or something. Or post up with another friend or family member. \n\nI'm not sure what the right answer is but I do think protecting your daughter's should be number one. There are options", "If your wife is scared that her sister might not last the week bc of this guy, she\u2019s actually solidifying your point. If he knows where you live, and he is that dangerous, your SIL is putting you all at risk. She can stay, but then you and your daughters have to go (or she can leave and your wife is going to be pissed). Your wife has to choose: her sister or her husband and daughters. NTA", "If she isn't leaving or being forced out, then I think it's time to discuss a restraining order with SIL. She will not want to hear it, so either she'll leave or she'll eventually cave. I feel like this is the time to have an intervention, but your wife needs to be on board so SIL will listen. In the meantime, discussing a restraining order is good, if not for her, then your family. If he knows where you live, that is an immenent danger to your family, and if there was an incident, you can get a restraining order for your family. NTA", "NTA, this screams episode of 48 hours, her problems do not outweigh the safety of two teenagers.", "Maybe your SIL should make better choices when it comes to men. No offense intended,  but it\u2019s beyond the pale that your wife expects this of you. Your family would be at risk for terrible choices SIL is making. You are totally NTA. People have gone a lil crazy in the world and this could end badly.", "NTA. SIL continues to go back and put herself in danger. These situations typically tend to escalate.  If you can financially do so, offer to pay for a few nights for a hotel but until SIL make a serious attempt to end it with that loser you will not support her if she goes back yet again.", "NtAH - your sil makes stupid choices - repeatedly and that could in fact endanger you and your daughters so you have every right to say only for the night - then sort it out yourself.  The sil is not a kid but your daughters are.  Dateline alone has dozens of dozens of stories just about this type of abuse situation that turns ugly fast.", "YTA. \n\nYour sister in law is family and she needs help. \n\nYour logic doesn't even make sense. You are worried that her boyfriend will come looking for her putting your family in danger. You do realize that he can come looking for her whether she is staying with you or not, right? Having her stay elsewhere won't make you, her, or your kids any safer.", "Soft YTA.\n\nI get it, it's a potentially dangerous situation you're trying to spare your daughters from. \n\nHowever, that's your wife's sister. If you boot her out, and something tragic happens to her, your wife will blame you for the rest of your marriage. Also, the lesson you're setting up for your daughters is kinda sucky. \"I care about you girls, but Auntie is in a bad situation, domestic violence is bad and shouldn't be tolerated until it comes to my doorstep. If she dies, oh well. And if this happens to you, don't bug your sister with it. She has a family to look out for.\"\n\nIt takes so much for someone to actually leave a DV situation. Victims and survivors try to go somewhere safe, and she sees you and her sister as safe. You want to take away that safety. Also, it's a few days, not permanent. If he shows up, call the cops.", "NAH", "I understand wanting to get her sister out of harms way and offering the emergency shelter and your pov about the safety of your daughters.  \n\nYour she needs be gone asap is a little harsh and not really considering how your wife feels.  I am certain she is concerned for your daughters, too, AND for her sister, who can't seem to get out of her own way.\n\nHow about trying to find a hotel or domestic abuse resources in the area to help offer an alternative solution instead of just kicking the sister out without a plan??  \n\nI am leaning towards a soft YTA here.  Soft because I think your heart is in the right place with your daughters but not with your wife, and it should be with both.\n\nPlease be a help, not another obstacle in this situation.", "YTA. Exclusively for the fact that if you think he's going to come there to find the sister, he's coming whether she's there or not. It's not hard to hide the evidence of her being there to keep everyone involved safe. \n\nIn the meantime, you could tell her that she can only stay if she makes a police report (if it's serious enough) or proves that she's blocked him on all forms of communication.\n\nOtherwise, your wife is protecting her sister. You can't really be mad at her for that. It's an admirable trait that a lot of people don't have.", "ESH\n\nYou do realize that regardless of where your SIL stays, crazy bf is going to think she is with you, right?

I would argue that the sister is a soft YTA cuz she\u2019s taught her bf that he can treat her like crap and she\u2019ll stay with him. Now that may affect ops children.

So she isn't to blame for being treated badly, but she's to blame for being with him at all.", "It takes an average of ten times before a woman successfully leaves an abusive man. The manipulative tactics abusive men use is unreal!", "You have no idea how little choice people have in these situations. I\u2019ve worked with a lot of women who were kept financially unable to leave, women who are too afraid to leave because they\u2019ll be killed if they get caught, women who are told that their children will be harmed or removed from them if they leave, women who were physically restrained from leaving, or threatened into returning. Women who\u2019d been so broken down that they\u2019d go back because they no longer believed that they deserve better, after years of belittling and being told it\u2019s their fault. One woman had a husband who took *her clothes* so she wouldn\u2019t be able to leave the house at all. \n\nThere are a million nasty ways that bad people can keep someone to themselves, and it\u2019s unhelpful to suggest that people should just leave. It\u2019s dangerous and sometimes impossible, and it can take years for an opportunity to leave safely and successfully to present itself. If there was a 15% chance that you\u2019d be beaten to death if you left your house today, would you still want to go outside? Probably not. If you thought there was a 75% chance that you\u2019d be beaten to death if you leave a relationship (or if you don\u2019t return), you\u2019d probably think quite seriously about what the safest option was. \n\nAll this to say, you really shouldn\u2019t judge so quickly or harshly when it comes to abusive relationships, there are so many reasons why someone might be unable to successfully break free. It costs nothing to refrain from victim blaming, and you really stand to gain nothing by making abuse victims feel small.", "NTA, you are in the right to protect your children.

It's one of those memories that is seared into my brain and looking back was extremely inappropriate for a child to be dragged into.\n\nThere are other ways you can help without jeopardizing your children's safety or mental health, so please don't let your wife do this to your girls.", "NAH \n\nYour wife has every reason to be concerned for her sisters safety.   You have every reason to be concerned for your family's safety.   If this man is as crazy as you described,  then even if SIL is not at your house, your family may still be in danger.  Abusers tend to go to the closest family or friends that they think are hiding their target.  They are just as likely to turn violent with family, just to hurt their intended target.  Basically, your family could be in danger just by knowing this guy's target.\n\nPersonally, I would tell wife and SIL that this is her one chance.  She has to take the necessary steps to remove this man from her life permanently; press charges, file a protective order, cut all contact with him, etc.  Providing she does all of this, you guys will help in whatever way you can, but if she goes back or continues contact in any way that's it, your done, you will not allow their craziness to hurt your daughters.", "NTA.

I work with domestic violence survivors. There is definitely a risk of him coming after her. After you leave an abusive relationship, this is the most dangerous time and things can really escalate. There are lots of people who don't stay with family for this reason, and also because it makes it easier to find her so it's less safe for her too. \n\nI agree with what others have said about trying to be as supportive as possible otherwise, though. For ex help her as much as you can with finding somewhere to go, emphasize that you're concerned about her safety as well as the safety of your family. Supporting her as much as possible may help prevent her from going back to the relationship, but also know that this is really really hard for survivors to do. Also know that you're not to blame if she does go back. I know its hard to understand, but try to avoid judging her for the times they have gotten back together, there are soooo many barriers and reasons behind this. \n\nA shelter may be helpful because there's usually security features and caseworkers who can support her with making a long term plan for housing, etc. I know it doesn't sound ideal but they can be much nicer than people expect, can't speak for your area but may be an option to look into. \n\nLook up your local or national domestic violence shelter/organization and find/ask for safety planning info for her.
