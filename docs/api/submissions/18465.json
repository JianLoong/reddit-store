I imagine your wife wouldn't be siding with her sister either if, instead of mount, your heirlooms were slightly more traditional, such as furniture, jewelry or art pieces. None of us chooses what objects are handed down through the generations.\n\nThe question then becomes, is this a hill you want to die on?

Basic courtesy. The only time I'd remotely think it'd be okay to ask something like this is if there are young kids who'd be utterly scared and they're on the verge of homelessness; in that case, I might consider storage at their expense if the kids couldn't work past it.", ">I would be very concerned with her deciding to remove the stuff anyway and possibly damaging them or just throwing them away.\n\nThis part here. If SIL somehow still stays at the cabin, have everything appraised and have a lease drawn up that clearly outlines the terms of the lease: length of stay (or month-to-month) lease, and clearly spell out that she to not alter the place or alter/remove decor and any such alterings could be considered damaging the property and she will have to reimburse you their appraised value plus sentimental value. (I am not a lawyer, but a lawyer should be able to put that into the correct legalese. Basically - she, or anyone else, tries to rip down and/or destroy/throw away these items you'll sure her for damages.)", "Where does it say SIL is married, in a relationship or has a spouse ?", "So the sister in law pays the storage fees?  because those things are big and who knows how many they are.  The only manufactured outrage here are the sisters acting like drama llamas.  So I agree.", "That\u2019s a great idea in theory, terrible idea in practice. The cost of a storage unit large enough and secure enough (and temperature controlled enough) to store what is tens of thousands, potentially nearing 6 figures of furs and mounts, holding sentimental value would be huge. OP is already generous to offer his cabin, incurring hundreds of dollars a month plus whatever transportation/moving costs on top of whatever costs of having her stay in the cabin is too much.", "A fair suggestion, not really, a somewhat foolish idea truly, but: does OP have a room to store all their beautiful corpses? If they do, is it on the property itself? If not, they'll need to transport all of their fancy fleshiness offsite, and those babies are fragile little mummies - they might very well get a boo boo while on the right, and the wrath of an arquebuse-wielding ancestor is nothing to be sneezed at.\n\nFurthermore, if they need to rent a storage space, who's gonna pay for it? The pauper princess, who oh so mightily despises our treasured taxidermied tootie-patooties? Or will it be another weight piled on OP's back, his spine already bent to breaking point by the scorn of their forefathers?\n\nNay, say I! Let them rot as they always have, proudly displayed on their open-space sepulcher!", "Or \u201caccidentally\u201d destroy them in some way.

I really dislike hunting mounts, but if I were staying somewhere for free, I'd suck it up and put up with them until I could save some money to get my own place.

I'm not a fan but I'd deal with them almost everywhere except the bedroom and the bathroom. I wouldn't be able to sleep or shower or pee feeling like I was being watched, lol.

Now you cant hunt everything you used to, but I shot plenty of plains game and shipped it back. I have 10s of thousands in game and fish mounts in my house and so does my brother. My dad has hundreds of thousands and likely low millions, some of his mounts you absolutely could not replace now. He has shot every major sheep species in the world and just the north American ones you are looking at probably 200k+ numerous years to replace, dont get started on Marco Polo or Altai Arghali sheep hunt. If I had an inkling that someone would mess with my mounts or my families at all they wouldn't be welcome in my house or my cabin.", "For that kinda rent, I'd be dusting all of them every single night, them shits would be IMMACULATE.

Sorry that your wife doesn't have your back.", "If SIL do end up staying they might remove the hunting mounts.", "My family has mounts. We take them down put them in another room, put them back up. It's not that serious. Idk anyone who pays people to wrap mounts. Ffs people have mounts in their garages here. My dad uses a huge buck mount as a hat rack. You take the mount down, wrap it in a drop cloth or plastic, and call it a day.", "Yeah, if it\u2019s prohibitive, of course he doesn\u2019t have to, I was just thinking if it wasn\u2019t too much trouble, it would be a kind thing to do. Just the thought of it makes me skin crawl lol. I can\u2019t help being sympathetic. But of course, it\u2019s very nice of him just to offer her a place to stay.", "Yeah, but is REALLY that big of a deal to take something down. It\u2019s not like she asked them to throw it out. I\u2019m sure if it was a creepy clown picture or photos of OP and their spouse having sex people would have other opinions. Those I\u2019m sure would make others uncomfortable just like the dead animals looking at her from the wall maker her uncomfortable. And this isn\u2019t an animal lover thing. I love me a good burger.", "This. Wound I be uncomfortable around them, yes.
