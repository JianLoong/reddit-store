If SIL somehow still stays at the cabin, have everything appraised and have a lease drawn up that clearly outlines the terms of the lease: length of stay (or month-to-month) lease, and clearly spell out that she to not alter the place or alter/remove decor and any such alterings could be considered damaging the property and she will have to reimburse you their appraised value plus sentimental value. (I am not a lawyer, but a lawyer should be able to put that into the correct legalese. Basically - she, or anyone else, tries to rip down and/or destroy/throw away these items you'll sure her for damages.)", "Where does it say SIL is married, in a relationship or has a spouse ?", "So the sister in law pays the storage fees?  because those things are big and who knows how many they are.  The only manufactured outrage here are the sisters acting like drama llamas.  So I agree.", "That\u2019s a great idea in theory, terrible idea in practice. The cost of a storage unit large enough and secure enough (and temperature controlled enough) to store what is tens of thousands, potentially nearing 6 figures of furs and mounts, holding sentimental value would be huge. OP is already generous to offer his cabin, incurring hundreds of dollars a month plus whatever transportation/moving costs on top of whatever costs of having her stay in the cabin is too much.", "A fair suggestion, not really, a somewhat foolish idea truly, but: does OP have a room to store all their beautiful corpses? If they do, is it on the property itself? If not, they'll need to transport all of their fancy fleshiness offsite, and those babies are fragile little mummies - they might very well get a boo boo while on the right, and the wrath of an arquebuse-wielding ancestor is nothing to be sneezed at.\n\nFurthermore, if they need to rent a storage space, who's gonna pay for it? The pauper princess, who oh so mightily despises our treasured taxidermied tootie-patooties? Or will it be another weight piled on OP's back, his spine already bent to breaking point by the scorn of their forefathers?\n\nNay, say I! Let them rot as they always have, proudly displayed on their open-space sepulcher!", "Or \u201caccidentally\u201d destroy them in some way. If you still want her to move in there, I\u2019d recommend drawing up a contract that states she\u2019d have to reimburse you a hefty price if she ends up damaging the mounts.", "Don\u2019t throw a sheet over them, don\u2019t touch other people\u2019s expensive taxidermy. This lady is getting a free place to live. Either suck it up or don\u2019t live there.", "Even then... I really dislike hunting mounts, but if I were staying somewhere for free, I'd suck it up and put up with them until I could save some money to get my own place. The OP might want to establish beforehand how long the SIL can stay there to make sure she understands that this is not a long-term situation/solution.", "It would depend on where they were for me. I'm not a fan but I'd deal with them almost everywhere except the bedroom and the bathroom. I wouldn't be able to sleep or shower or pee feeling like I was being watched, lol. But even then, I'd politely ask if any in those rooms can be moved to a different spot in the house or if we can figure out a way to cover them without damaging them.", "Also even if you disapprove of hunting, you can't bring the animals back to life by relocating them.", "American hunters still go overseas on Safari, Im a millennial and have done it. Now you cant hunt everything you used to, but I shot plenty of plains game and shipped it back. I have 10s of thousands in game and fish mounts in my house and so does my brother. My dad has hundreds of thousands and likely low millions, some of his mounts you absolutely could not replace now. He has shot every major sheep species in the world and just the north American ones you are looking at probably 200k+ numerous years to replace, dont get started on Marco Polo or Altai Arghali sheep hunt. If I had an inkling that someone would mess with my mounts or my families at all they wouldn't be welcome in my house or my cabin.", "For that kinda rent, I'd be dusting all of them every single night, them shits would be IMMACULATE. I'd learn each one's name and story like they were roommates!", "That's why I said OP is NTA!", "I would be very worried about how they would treat your mounts and rugs...make sure if you still want them to move in that you secure damage deposits, inventory of all items and the value and have some form of contract in place that states damages will be recouped so they don't get any ideas...it's shocking that someone who needs a favor would behave like this. Sorry that your wife doesn't have your back.", "If SIL do end up staying they might remove the hunting mounts.", "My family has mounts. We take them down put them in another room, put them back up. It's not that serious. Idk anyone who pays people to wrap mounts. Ffs people have mounts in their garages here. My dad uses a huge buck mount as a hat rack. You take the mount down, wrap it in a drop cloth or plastic, and call it a day.", "Yeah, if it\u2019s prohibitive, of course he doesn\u2019t have to, I was just thinking if it wasn\u2019t too much trouble, it would be a kind thing to do. Just the thought of it makes me skin crawl lol. I can\u2019t help being sympathetic. But of course, it\u2019s very nice of him just to offer her a place to stay.", "Yeah, but is REALLY that big of a deal to take something down. It\u2019s not like she asked them to throw it out. I\u2019m sure if it was a creepy clown picture or photos of OP and their spouse having sex people would have other opinions. Those I\u2019m sure would make others uncomfortable just like the dead animals looking at her from the wall maker her uncomfortable. And this isn\u2019t an animal lover thing. I love me a good burger.", "This. Wound I be uncomfortable around them, yes. But in a situation where it\u2019s put up with bad decorations or homelessness I would be keeping my mouth shut.", "right, it's not to my taste but a) it's a family spot and b) I'm getting it free. NTA", "u/DrySheephrder59 is a bot.", "Same. I think it's gross but I sure as hell wouldn't say anything or ask someone to redecorate their house! Especially if they were doing me a favor by letting me stay there.", "How should I know? I never made any of those claims.", "I really enjoyed how you wrote this!", "Hahaha \ud83e\udd23  and what would that contract do ? She\u2019s already living on handouts", "If they can support it, you can drape stuff over the mounts. I'm not sure if the furs are storable in a linen closet? I feel like there could be workarounds without getting rid of anything.\n\n{I've totally got that Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls [trophy room scene](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=nOVmH5H60Vs) stuck in my head}", "This is the salient point for me. She's not contributing to any further suffering by existing around their dead bodies. I wouldn't like it either, but for this person it seems to be a matter of taste rather than ethics.", "My mom many years ago was in Germany during winter and needed to buy better boots. She bought the warmest boots that she could find and didn\u2019t realize until later that the tag translated to \u201cbaby beaver fur\u201d. My mom\u2019s friend wanted her to toss them immediately, but my mom didn\u2019t saying that it would be like killing the beaver twice.\n\nThose boots lasted well over 20 years and I\u2019m doing research to see I can get them repaired.", "Right? LoL! I'd even be like \"Would that be all, SIR?\"", "I just saw a comment of his where he said that it would be difficult to remove and store everything. https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13uwpo0/aita_for_refusing_to_remove_the_hunting_mounts/jm2u1gl?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button    \n\nWhile I understand she'd be uncomfortable, maybe that's not a bad thing since it would get her to figure out her own housing more quickly. And maybe it's just me, but I'd be *much* more uncomfortable asking my sister's husband to completely remove all the decorations in a house that he's letting me stay in for free.", "It sounds like it is a lot of stuff though, in a comment he equated it to removing all the decorations and rugs in someone's home. They may not have room to store all of that, plus the amount of work it would take to basically empty the house. One or two pictures  is different then almost everything in an entire cabin/house.", "no one said you made those claims, but you started talking about her \"spouse\". a spouse wasn't mentioned, so why the need to tell everyone that her spouse would also be an in-law? it wasn't brought up at all until you mentioned it, then you got weird about people asking why you said it lol", "\u201cAnd sisters spouse is also the sibling in-law. So if the sister had a husband, he would be OPs BIL\u201d", "Some people seem to think that contracts and lawsuits are magical. You can\u2019t get money out of people that don\u2019t have money.", "contract could state that she will be immediately removed from the home.", "You have her ass thrown in jail", "I get scared by helium inflated balloons bobbing around in the dark. I bet animal heads mounted on the wall would be even scarier, but draping a lite cloth over them seems like a great compromise as it should also help deter dust and sun exposure.", "No, just no. Taxidermy is incredibly expensive. You don\u2019t touch or hang stuff over other peoples art work. Whether on not you agree with mounts, it\u2019s expensive art to the owner. Don\u2019t touch it.", "Got it. Ok well I\u2019m definitely not arguing in her favor. It is what it is. Hope she finds her own place soon.", "Could be held off until she manages to improve her finances. And this is only if OP even decides to let her in. The better choice would be to not but pressure from someone you love can be quite hard to fight back against depending from person to person.", "Depends on the state, but most states don't let you put things like that in the lease, it is usually somewhat complicated to evict someone.", "Depends on location and a judge could take one look at that contract and Toss OP out of the court room", "I'm sure OP could just skip to getting a divorce now if he wants. Without having to go through the intermediate steps of suing his SIL.", "That's not how contracts work", "Oh God,  for what ?", "Yeah it's hard to know exactly how much stuff would need to be moved, but I'm guessing it's a lot since it would be several generations' worth of stuff! I think they were being nice to even offer her the cabin just so it would be closer to her work, so I'm shocked that someone would have the audacity to ask them to remove all the decor. It just seems so rude to me.", "Yep   take the path of least resistance", "What is wrong with y\u2019all? This is not a divorce worthy issue jfc."]}
