There are a lot of furs rugs and head mounts. \n\nShe told me she can't move in and needed them to go. I was taken aback since we are doing her a huge favor. I told her all the stuff is staying. She was mad but I thought that was it. I get home and my wife goes off on me for caring more about the family mounts than her sister being comfortable.

And I wouldn't let her stay there now even if she \"changes her mind\" because those mounts would disappear.", "NTA (and I'm saying this as someone who would not be comfortable in that environment). This is some choosy beggars crap. You're offering her a chance to stay for free and she has the cheek to not like your home's decor? I honestly don't understand how people can be this rude when someone is trying to help them out.", "Nta those mounts are antiques and worth a lot as long as they're preserved as is or handled by a professional. Absolutely don't let her sisters ignorance change your layout.", "She who accepts free housing does not get to re-decorate against the owner's wishes.\n\n\nYou have yourself a choosy begger situation.", "NTA\n\nIf she wants the mounts and other things removed. Fine.  Charge the storage fee, the fee for moving them and some rent (so you can afford to move everything back when she leaves).  Then put it in writing.  She will need to sign a lease. Full stop.\n\nIf she is suddenly willing to move in, then have her sign a lease saying she will be responsible for any damage to the items in the cabin.  Make sure the hunting trophies etc., are itemised and put about double what you think they are worth.\n\nTell your wife, since she does not have your back, so you are thinking of asking her to move into the cabin with or without her sister until she decides to talk to you. Tell her if her sister means more than your marriage, you can see where her loyalties are.", "Absolutely NTA, you are doing her a great favour by letting her stay at your cabin for free. I understand that having embalmed animals can be strange or sad if you are not used to it, but I think that in this situation she can manage to tolerate them.\nIf she does want to stay in the cabin please have me instead ahahah", "NTA\nYou are doing a favor. If she doesn\u2019t like how the cabin is she can figure out a place to stay for herself.", "NTA ....bro that's just the start of it.....if you put her in that house she'll never leave and (your family property)will become her personal property.\nSounds like bad news bears to me dude", "Yeah, honestly do not look a gift horse in its mouth.\n\nIf your SIL want a fancy place she should pay for that. \nYour property, your rules.\n\nOP. NTA", "NTA. I can't stand hunting mounts, would never have them in my home I was paying for but this is a free place for her to stay so all bets are off.", "NTA . They didn't hear anytime about being entitled . If they changed their mind . Do not accept! Because they will take your stuff to the trash and your wife would be on their side.\n\nAnd it will be the end of your marriage.", "NTA\n\nLike yourself grew up with antlers everywhere. But displays with marble eyes, clowns and dolls spook some people. Did you ever see the movie \"House\"1985. Yip couldn't watch that myself, stay in your cabin and sleep alone. \n\n In your place I would move SIL into house with your wife and take off for the cabin but that would just cause other problems for you.\n\nBut If you chose to take the mounts down tell her and your wife she can now pay rent for your inconvenience.  Or if no rent give a time limit like two months.  Not sure if you have any place to store the mounts. If the place has only one room tell her she will have to sleep in the living room as that is were you will need to store the mounts. Just make sure you put a lock on the door so she and your wife don't have a bonfire.", "NTA you\u2019re doing her a favor out of the kindness of your heart and remind her that. If she has an issue with the furs and mounts please feel free to stay elsewhere. Also tell her if she removes or destroys them without your knowledge you will throw her out on her ass so fast it will make her head spin. Remember you give an inch and they will take a mile. Make this known before she moves in. If your wife thinks it\u2019s a problem remind her that you\u2019re helping her out but it\u2019s still your cabin and you wish it to remain the same. Get everything in writing before she moves in so if she does get rid or destroy them she is responsible for paying you back. You\u2019re not being an asshole for this.", "NTA. She wants you to remove your family memorable things kept for generations. I would refuse. If she doesn't want to use your generously offered place for free - that's her choice.", "Nta.

If you do those mounts will disappear. Guaranteed. \n\nNTA", "NTA. She knows it's a family hunting cabin, I assume? Tell her you'll take them down if she pays you $600 / month in rent.", "NTA. Place the biggest mount over her bed.", "don't let her stay , first she is entitled and ungrateful but second she will throw them away\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA", "NTA your trying to be nice. I can tell you that you may want to rethink letting her stay there. She will try to move the mounts and damage them.", "NTA. Don't let her move in please. She'll ruin the place and never leave.", "NTA\n\nThat being said.. doesn't this mean she'll be living with you guys since you said that was the previous plan? If so you might want to consider just putting all the hunting stuff in a spare room just so you don't have her at your place....", " NTA and what is your wife thinking? This house is a family heirloom which you are graciously offering your SIL to use. I personally don\u2019t care for mounted animals, but have been in plenty of places that have them. Don\u2019t like them, don\u2019t have them in your own home. Need a free place to crash because you\u2019re on hard times-better politely accept what\u2019s there.", "NTA No good deed goes unpunished. She can either live with it or move out. Or better yet, retract the offer while you have a chance.", "NTA \n\nGive a inch, they take a mile. If your wife is so mad she can find her sister a place to live then. Most people would be grateful to have a roof over their head.. for free no less, than go around barking out orders on what to do with said free place..", "NTA. Make sure to tell her those are valuable and you'll take her to court if they mysteriously disappear.", "NTA and do not budge on this.", "NTA\n\nMounts, animal-skin rugs, fur coats... heck, all of those products freak me the f out. \n\nBut, yeah, you don't look a gift horse in the mouth. Your SIL is in no position to dictate terms. Your mounts are family heirlooms. I imagine your wife wouldn't be siding with her sister either if, instead of mount, your heirlooms were slightly more traditional, such as furniture, jewelry or art pieces. None of us chooses what objects are handed down through the generations.\n\nThe question then becomes, is this a hill you want to die on? And what do you do with the mounts if you (temporarily) remove them to accomodate SIL? Because I assume damaging the mounts by storing them improperly is not an option and I'm assuming the hunting cabin doesn't have so many bedrooms that you can move them to a single room where she doesn't have to look at them. \n\nBecause I am with you. You are 1000% NTA. But marriage is about compromise. Good luck.", "Seriously?!  What is with the entitlement of people being given things for free?!?!  She can take the cabin, as is, or she can find another place to stay!  I don\u2019t love mounted heads of animals, but am I going to refuse free accommodations in my time if need because of them?  Hell no. I\u2019ll say thanks so much for this opportunity!  I appreciate your generosity!  \n\nNTA", "NTA but I can understand where your SIL is coming from. I would not be comfortable staying at a place with dead animals hanging on the walls. I would absolutely have nightmares.", "NTA.  But how much trouble would it be to remove and replace once she leaves.  Genuinely asking, as I have no idea what goes into this.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
