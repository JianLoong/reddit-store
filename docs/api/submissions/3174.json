I was on break eating my lunch in the break room a long with a couple of my female coworkers.  They were talking about something to do with one of their ex boyfriends and how they behaved, and would regularly throughout the conversation tie it back to him being a Taurus.  Whatever, I don't care.  I just want to eat my food.  After a while of this they turn to me and ask me to confirm that all Taurus men act a certain way (Im one of the few men who work at this facility so I regularly get asked to weigh in on this kinda stuff).  I just flat out say \"I don't really believe in that kinda stuff so I cant say.\".  The girl who asked me immediately kinda laughs and scoffs and says \"Oh you're one of THOSE guys\" in a teasing tone.  This really kinda bothered me, but I still held my tongue and just said \"Yup.\" and tried to go back to eating.  Before I could even get the food in my mouth she of course asked what my sign was.  Just to try and get her to stop talking I just tell her it's Cancer.  She and her friend immediately look at each other as if they had it all figured out and laughed while the other girl loudly exclaims while clapping \"I so knew it omg\".\n\nThis is where I just couldn't help myself anymore, I shoot back with \"So you're able to tell so much about me just by my sign?\", which she replies with \"Well yeah, most cancers tend to be super stubborn and skeptical about stuff like you.\".  Then I said the line \"Well I think it's kinda messed up how you think I must act and behave a certain way based purely on something I can't control like the month I was born in, that's basically space racism.\"\n\nThey immediately change their tone and one of the girls immediately launches into a rant about how that's super insensitive and how im trivializing the struggles on minorities.  I tried to get a word in to elaborate that I was just drawing a comparison and didn't mean anything offensive about it but literally couldn't.  After she got done telling me how awful I was they both quickly packed up and left the break room.  Part of me feels bad because it was never my intention to upset them that much, but at the same time I felt like it was in line with the point I was making.

While this is in no way the same as racism in terms of oppression or harm caused.... your comparison is not entirely wrong in terms of simply explaining why you think it's wrong. Believing in predetermined stereotypes based on the conditions of one's birth is basically the definition of any kind of \"ism,\" like racism or sexism.

Considering how colloquially people use the word racism in everyday conversation to refer to various issues both big and small, using the word racism as an analogy makes sense.

Jfc I know the bare fucking minimum about astrology and i know that becayse we don't live in fucking Homestuck", "Then it would be space determinism, or space stereotyping.

NTA", "That\u2019s not religion, though. \n\nAstrology is like ghosts or the Mothman; something people might believe in or not.\n\nSaying the pledge of allegiance is dogmatic, and so is following the steps laid out by a pickup artist. \n\nAnd still none of it is religion.", "I think we're misunderstanding each other. When you said that \"Astrology is a game people like to play,\" I took that to mean that you think people don't take it seriously, so there's no need to try to correct them. You don't correct people for playing a silly game because you know that's not what they *actually* believe--or else it wouldn't be a game to them. \n\nI wasn't pointing out that people take it seriously to say that astrology is real or to claim that the number of believers makes it more real somehow. Rather, I was trying to say it's not just a game to many people. Thus, I can understand why OP felt the need to say something negative about astrology, as these girls seemed to be taking it a bit farther than just a game. \n\nPerhaps I misunderstood your original point. But if so, then I have no idea what you were actually trying to say. Maybe you can clarify?", "All those Libra only water fountains!", "Yeah, we know, staunch atheists hate pagan fun things. No surprise. \n\nIs it harder for a Scorpio to find a job in an office setting? Are Taurus routinely underpaid compared to their Gemini counterparts?

But unlike any given cryptid, astrology is codified. So if you say you think that all Pisces are ridged-minded, rule-oriented types. You'd be absolutely wrong based on their codified belief system. It is precisely a religion.", "I guess in summary, whether the people playing the game think it's real or realize it's just for fun, why engage and taunt them pointlessly.

I don't see any offense in someone attributing personality traits to me based on horoscopes or making inconsequential decisions based on them.\n\n However, the idea of attributing personality traits based on your zodiac is in theory, the same as attributing personality traits based on ethnicity and race. In practice, of course it's very different, I don't think someone stereotyping certain zodiac signs is anything on the scale of racial profiling, but the thought process is the same. A judgment is made about someone based not on their character, but on their birth. The term \"space racism\" is apt as the \"space\" trivializes the negative connotation of the word but still acknowledges the seriousness of racism.
