John and I have very close since were kids. He was my first best friend. His first marriage sadly ended due to his wife being unfaithful and eventually he remarried. Susan (37) my new SIL joined the family.\n\nI noticed John begin to change after the marriage and he wasn't like himself. Every time I asked to hang out with him he would make excuses. He only lives 30 minutes away but I would hardly see him anymore. I finally figured it had to be because of Susan. Therefore, the next time I saw Susan at a social gathering I completely ignored her. When I got home that night my brother's car was in front of the house and Susan jumped out of the car and demanded to speak to me. I simply sped away to avoid confrontation. This was back in 2014. \n\nFast forward several years and my maternal grandma was diagnosed with Alzheimer's. My mom did not want to put her in a nursing home so a live-in caretaker was hired and mom, Iris, my niece, and a couple family friends and I took turns caring for her. When COVID hit, Grandma entered the final stages of the disease and I temporarily shut down my small business to spend more time helping out. She passed away last June.\n\nOur family held a funeral service via Zoom and put together a slide show with pics of Grandma and her grandkids. Two weeks later I got an extremely long scathing text from John saying how dare we (my husband and I) exclude Susan from the slideshow and how terrible and rude we are to her. I told him 1) neither of us were in charge of the slideshow 2) he and Susan never visited Grandma even ONE TIME all these years she was sick 3) Susan was crossing the line by making Grandma's death about her. John then demanded an apology for the aforementioned event in 2014 and I refused and said the reason why I ignored Susan that night was because she had made him cut me out of his life and now he had cut the rest of our family including Grandma out of his life for no reason. He hasn't spoken to me since. Iris also finally admitted that she was also fed up with the situation and very disappointed. I really miss my brother but I don't feel like I did anything wrong.\n\nETA: Yes, I tried talking to my brother for years about the issue but he kept avoiding me and Susan is constantly with him and monitors who he talks to. Susan did not attend the funeral and John logged out before the slideshow started. My parents also received a similar text which made my mother break down and cry.", "created_utc": 1669510213, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z5n21m/aita_for_not_apologizing_to_my_sil/", "score": 87, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Sounds like she was looking for any reason then to make sure he cuts you out.  \n\n\nThey ditched you and your family, they never visited your grandmother, and now she is the victim????\n\n\nYour NTA AT ALL.  But no amount of apologizing to her for her issues will ever get your brother back.  She is obviously controlling him.  In order them to be in any contact with you guys, they would need to apologize for her made up BS, everyone would essentially treat her like a queen, kiss her butt, allow her to treat everyone how she wants, turn a blind eye to her bad behavior.\n\n\nHonestly, your brother made his choice, and you need to not feel guilty or bad for any of it.

I only went to his house twice by myself and Susan was there each time so it was very difficult to have a heart-to-heart alone with him. It's funny that you say I disliked her from the beginning when the first time I was there and looking through their new wedding album that I noticed I was in none of the pictures.

I can't fit all the context into one post unfortunately.", "He blocked me on his phone but not his Xbox. He would only talk to me briefly on Xbox messaging because Susan doesn't know how to check or operate an Xbox. I'm basing my assumptions on years of context.", "She's right though. He's a grown man and doesn't speak up when his wife pulls these stunts. Grandma and my parents are innocent in all of this.", "It\u2019s really odd that Susan needing to follow a schedule somehow means she\u2019s isolating your brother from you. I just don\u2019t get the connection you\u2019re making here.", "John is a grown man who has made it clear by his own actions that he doesn't want a relationship with you.\n\nIs there a reason? Maybe, maybe not. But you are blaming your SIL - in effect, saying that the only possible explanation is that John is being emotionally abused (because that is what it is when you isolate your spouse.)\n\nIs it possible he's being emotionally abused? Yes. But is it also possible he has a reason? Yes. Is it possible you know this reason and don't want to share it on the internet? Yes. Is it possible you don't know this reason? Yes. Is it possible there is no reason, he just doesn't want to have a relationship with you? Again, yes.\n\nThere is exactly one scenario where Susan is the bad guy - she is an abusive spouse. There are multiple scenarios where this is John's decision and you are blaming her. \n\nEither is possible. I don't know you, I don't know John, and I don't know Susan.\n\nWhat I do know is that if John is being abused, you are going about this the wrong way. You may want to speak with a domestic violence counseling service to get some tips on what you can do to help and support him.\n\nIf on the other hand this is John's decision and he has decided (for whatever reason - or for no reason at all) that he simply does not want to have anything to do with you or his family anymore, the only option open to you is to just move on.\n\nThat is a judgement only you can make. \n\nAs the much hated in-law who is blamed for everything despite doing my best to bend over backwards for my husband's family, yes, this does strike a chord. My husband made his own decisions - he was his own man and he had his own reasons for the distance. I supported him because that's my job as his wife. I am hated for it now and my children are too. But hating me doesn't actually get to the heart of the matter (a lifetime of favoritism, ignoring him, and treating him like garbage.) Nobody ever bothered talking to us about what was really going on because it was easier for them to just blame me. So yes, I am bringing my own experience into this one.\n\nIs that fair? Again, I don't know any of you. But judging from my own experience it does seem like there is a lot missing in your narrative. Again, either you know what happened (and it could be something exceptionally petty) or you don't know what happened, or nothing happened and he just decided he doesn't want to be in your life anymore, or she's abusive. Those are your options. Make your choices accordingly.", "I apologize, I'll try to be more specific and try to give a couple examples. During one vacation we were at the beach for a week but my niece had summer school so she was only available for two days. She begged my brother to spend just one day with her. Susan gave John a look and John looked at the floor and said no, that he was going to the beach with Susan. Another time Susan insisted we all go to a Mexican restaurant. My niece didn't eat much and politely said that she just wasn't a fan of Mexican food but Susan still got upset about it to the point that it almost caused an argument.", "I totally understand what you mean because I've gone through something similar with my husband and his family. But I really try my best to get along with everyone and even bought John and Susan anniversary gifts a few years ago until my sister talked me out of it. It also disturbs me how terrified my brother behaves when she walks into the room sometimes. That along with many other things that happened makes me think that something is wrong but there's nothing we can do about it because they refuse to talk about it. I hope all is well with your family.", "Again, if you feel he is being abused, you need to speak with a domestic violence counselor. They can give you resources and information on what (if any) steps you can take. Most developed countries have free hotlines you can call for advice on such matters.\n\nYou might also want to get a counselor for yourself. If this is John's decision, it is traumatizing to be cut out of a sibling's life, and the counselor can help you through that transition. If he's being abused, the counselor can help you navigate that. And if you're really not sure, the counselor can help you figure things out.", "Thank you, I appreciate it!"]}
