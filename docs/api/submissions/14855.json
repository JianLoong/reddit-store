My wife and I met in seventh grade and we have now been married for 3 years, meaning we got married at 19 - which my mother (55f) had a complete exponential breakdown over but that\u2019s not super important.\n\nRecently, my wife has voiced her desire to go to Miami this summer to see her sister and brother-in-law, as well as their new baby. I was all for this idea, my wife and her sis have had some issues in the past and I was super excited that she was the one wanting to see her and it wasn\u2019t me forcing her to visit, like I usually end up doing.\n\nWe had the conversation and phone call about the logistics and what not and the travel plan as well as where we\u2019ll be staying is all done. I mentioned this in passing to my twin brother, who is actually the favorite child, and evidently he passed this forward to my mum and pops, who we were were planning to tell right before we left so that we could avoid a huge conflict over it. \n\nYesterday morning my mum called be crying on the phone saying that I have betrayed her, once again and how she couldn\u2019t believe I could do this to her. I asked her what she could be possibly be talking about and she revealed to me that my sister\u2019s (she\u2019s the eldest child and is probably even with my brother for favorite) baby shower is on the first full day that we\u2019d be in Miami after travel day 1 was over. Before my wife and I started booking things, we made sure that our trip wouldn\u2019t interfere with any of our siblings, and we were completely free to be gone from the second through the eighth. I called my sis to see why she rescheduled and she told me that mum said she felt like having a shower in may was a bad idea, which makes absolutely no sense but I don\u2019t even want to get into that. We talked, and I told her that I would stay back and come to her baby shower but I knew my wife wouldn\u2019t and that nobody was going to changed my mind or her mind on that decision. My wife is still going to Miami and I am over the top excited for her, but my mother has been calling us non stop saying how rude it was that she\u2019d choose her sister over mine when we\u2019re now a \u2018joint family\u2019 , my mother hasn\u2019t met 2/5 of my wife\u2019s siblings simply because she doesn\u2019t care to. She called super late last night, going on another one of her tangents about disrespect and I finally told her that she has no say in how my wife lives her life and she should be thankful I\u2019m even going to the baby shower. Apparently this really made her sad because my father called earlier this morning saying how out of line I was but I truly don\u2019t think what I did was too bad. Am I the ass here?\n\nUPDATE: I\u2019m going to address the top comments/questions below in different paragraphs.\n\nWhy do I \u201cforce\u201d my wife to see her family?- This was really bad wording on my part. My wife is one of seven children and only has one elder sibling that moved out when my wife was still pretty young. Due to the fact that my wife\u2019s parents were so young along with them having so many kids, a lot of the child care fell upon my wife. The kids (my wife and her siblings) don\u2019t talk to their parents anymore but they do talk to their extended family. The entirety of the family lives in Poland, my wife and her siblings are the only ones who live in the states and they pretty much stick out like a sore thumb because of it. I\u2019ve known her family since I was 12 and they\u2019ve become just as much my family as they are her\u2019s. I\u2019d also like to add that my wife and I raised the youngest three and they used to live with us but decided to go back and live with their parents when Ave and I moved to the city from the suburbs. In my opinion, my wife should try to see her family when they come (especially because they\u2019ve traveled so far) at least once. If she decides she doesn\u2019t want to see them I usually recommend a few accommodations I could make and if she still decides she doesn\u2019t want to see them, I leave it there and I see them alone. Finally, the reason my wife doesn\u2019t like to see them is because she has been making excuses since we graduated as to why we can\u2019t move to Poland and she doesn\u2019t want them trying to talk her into moving. \n\nI AM going to Miami WITH my wife. I had a conversation with my wife at lunch and we talked about me going LC with the twin and NC with my mum and pops. After hearing from everyone, and reading on the raised by a narcissist thread, I feel like I just need to cut my parents off and that\u2019s what I\u2019ll be doing. As for my brother, I just can\u2019t. I will be talking to him about my privacy and how I don\u2019t want him to be sharing my info as well as not sharing things that I know would be controversial. I know it seems stupid but I just cannot cut my brother off, he\u2019s my twin and has been with me since quite literally, the moment I was born. \n\nI talked to my sister earlier this evening and we\u2019ve decided that the three of us (my wife, myself, and her) will be going out to dinner next week and that is when I will talk to her about my boundaries with mum. I feel like it would be too much to do over the phone and she\u2019s too sensitive when it comes to those things.\n\nIn conclusion, I blocked my mum and pops\u2019 numbers, I\u2019m going to be going to Miami with my wife, I\u2019m not attending the baby shower, and I have boundaries set with my brother. Thank you to everyone who gave advice, even if it was harsh.

NTA", "NTA. The fact that you even feel you need to check with siblings to be sure your trip won't affect them and that you delayed telling your mother to avoid conflict is evidence that tgese people have too much control over you as it is. You don't owe anyone explanations or requests to make sure it's ok to do anything. You're an adult. Also sounds like your mother heard about the trip then had the shower date changed on purpose to try to control you. This is bonkers.", "OP, write a nice card, send a gift, and then go on the trip with your wife. This is ridiculous, and you are only reinforcing it by giving in even halfway. They don\u2019t own you, and invitations are not summons. NTA", "So, you\u2019re NTA for telling them your wife is still going. However, you are the issue here, and overall, YTA. Don\u2019t tell the golden children things. Don\u2019t give into your mom. You go to Miami with your wife. This is their fault, not yours, and you\u2019re punishing your wife by giving into your terrible family. Grow a spine.", "Yeah, OP do not go to the shower. All you will be doing is showing your mother she can keep manipulating you. It sucks that you would miss the shower but you need to make it very clear to your sister what your mother is doing and let her decide whether she wants to be an AH too and enable your mother.", "A more special day for her will be the day the baby is born. And many days after that, when she's recovered and you can be both brother and uncle in peace, not when she's put on display to perform and probably have your mother expecting things and making things unnecessarily difficult. If this one day without you there (in a room full of other people, so it wouldn't even be just the two of you interacting) would sabotage your relationship with your sister, then I'm sorry, but you have bigger problems in your relationship with her. Especially if she wouldn't understand why you aren't there. \n\nIt is hard to go LC or NC with a parent: harder too if you are not LC or NC with other family members, because you can not get a clean break then. You're still young, but ask yourself if this is how you want the rest of your life to be, for you and your wife and any potential children that might come along. \n\nGood luck.", "Few times a week???!", "Dude that is NOT low contact. At ALL. At A L L.", "Oh thank the stars!! Have fun in Miami. Make sure to go to calle 8 [8th street) and get some authentic Cuban food while you're there!!", "And get her a nice baby present. SIL should be able to recommend something useful, lol", "Yes\u2026. I usually send a \u201chey, hope your weeks been good. see you Sunday\u201d on Wednesday or Tuesday, I see them at mass on Sunday and I send an occasional \u201chey what have you been up to?\u201d once a week. More than twice so a few. My entire family is VERY close and they all pretty much talk daily, so two or three times a week is low contact for us.", "He should leave as scheduled. Don't reward the mother for AH behavior", "Should stick with the original plan OP.  Mom needs to learn that can't pull your puppet strings. This is a schedule conflict intentionally created by her.", "Thank you for the recommendation! We\u2019ve been before but didn\u2019t really get any food besides street vendors and an occasional gas station snack at the end of the night if we were still hungry. We\u2019ll be sure to check it out, have a great day!", "I bet OP could find some cute baby outfits in Miami!", "There are tons of restaurants on calle 8 but the best one is called La Carreta. Their food is delicious . The roast pork, croquetas, Cuban sandwiches and mufungo are to die for!!", "Oh and they are open til like 4 am, lol", "Let's be honest, baby showers aren't that important for brothers to attend. The mom to be opens gifts and there is cake. She'll live. Go on your trip! Have fun!", "Good. I was really frustrated at the thought you would prioritize your crappy family over your WIFE. That will only lead to resentment on your wife's end. If your mom and sister want to play these dumb games, they can live with the prizes. Tell your extended family your mom changed the date after learning of your plans and you are not going to reschedule your trip. Any family who sides against you, well, you know who to cut off like a cancerous tumor.", "Your mother isn't just a nutjob. She's a venomous hobgoblin, dripping with malicious intent, and perverted half truths.\n\nNTA cut her out.", "Man your family fuckin sucks dude. Sorry. Nta", "You need to set the tone with your mom now to butt out", "NTA- and let you parents know you feel emotionally manipulated. Shoot they are lucky you are going bc I would definitely have been like \"well we checked with y'all  before we made the plans. Skype me in when the party starts!\"", "NTA what a disfunctional family (no offense op). But imo, I wouldn't even come back for the baby shower.\n\nYou made plans around what was originally decided so as not to cause issues.\n\nYour mum and sister decided to change plans into the middle of your holiday.\n\nSounds like a tough break for them, they shouldnt have done it.", "NTA- and it sounds like your mom changed the date of the shower to coincide with your trip. I know it\u2019s your sister\u2019s baby shower, but if it were me, I\u2019d still be going to Miami with my spouse. Obviously talk to sister first and explain that she agreed to the date and so you made plans with family. I\u2019m sure she understands. I wouldn\u2019t be feeding into this manipulative behavior. Hopefully you learn to put your foot down eventually or your mom will increase her grasp over you and your marriage.", "NTA\n\nThis is like an episode of Everybody Loves Raymond lol", "NTA. Go to Miami. Go LC with your family until they learn to respect you and your wife as grown-ass adults. If you cow to their manipulation and guilt, the manipulation and guilt will never end.", "NTA. Your mother is deliberately trying to stir shit up and make your wife choose between her family and yours. It is manipulative and vile.\n\nDon't fall for it and don't give into her or apologize to her in any way. Do what works best for you.", "NTA....if I were you, give your sis her baby shower gift before you leave WITH your wife to Miami.", "NTA. Your mom did this on purpose. Send a gift and go to Miami.", "NTA, but is it possible your mom encouraged your sister to change the date just so it would interfere with your plans?", "You know as soon as your brother mentioned the vacation to Miami your mother had your sister change the shower date to May to stir drama. You need to move far away from your mother. Far away. This would be exhausting. Missing a shower is not a huge deal. You are not abandoning or betraying your family. NTA.", "I like the term \"information diet\".", "Yeah I gotta chime in here and say YWBTA if you don't go to Miami with your wife.", "That still doesn't really explain why you are forcing her. If she doesn't want to meet them, let her be, you guys are each other's family now, you don't have to be involved with people that don't treat you well or remind you of bad times.\n\nLet your wife reach out to her siblings whenever she wants to and attend whatever functions she feels comfortable. You are being a people pleaser with her family as well, let her deal with them as she wants to and take a step back.", "Except the brother was the one who told the parents so the information diet has to include him too", "I\u2019ve known these people since I was 12. Once my wife and I were serious and not just two seventh graders dating, I helped her practically raise the three youngest children. I\u2019ve known not only the kids but my wife\u2019s extended family for over a decade. Her family that lives in Poland treats her extremely well and in my opinion my wife should try to see her family when they come to America, at least once. If we know they\u2019re coming and she says she doesn\u2019t want to see them I try to recommend accommodations for her to see them. (ex; we see them at our home, we only see a few members at once, ect\u2026) When and if she does say no again after I put out accommodations, it\u2019s done. She\u2019ll stay home and do her own thing, as for me I go because that\u2019s my family. The only reason she doesn\u2019t always want to see them is because she doesn\u2019t want to talk to them about her not wanting to move to Poland.", "All that\u2019s going to happen at the shower (guess it\u2019s co-Ed?) is that you are going to get snide and passive aggressive comments from your mother about your wife\u2019s absence.", "Why so you try so hard to appease a toxic narcissistic mother and , by extend, family who bring nothing but pain, misery and hard labor? Ask yourself what would you actually lose by cutting them off? You really need to talk to a therapist to decouple yourself from this deeply unhealthy relationship and truly let yourself be happy.", "Here you go-- [Don't Rock the Boat!](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/77pxpo/dont_rock_the_boat/)", "NTA\u2026 good for you standing up for your wife\u2026", "Your mom sounds a lot like mine. I'm 29 now and only a couple of years ago did I decide I wasn't going to let her influence what I do. I think you should do the same. She will eventually realize she doesn't have that power over you anymore. Even with the phone calls where she drills into you about things like disrespect. I'm gonna venture to guess that she doesn't show any respect to you in the process. When my mom does this, I put the phone down on a table, far away enough that I can just barely hear that she's talking. I wait until she stops, or asks if I'm there and just say \"okay\" or \"yeah I'm here.\" If she continues with the rant then suddenly I need to go do something and can no longer be on the phone. \n\nSet up boundaries with her and hold onto them firmly. Your life will eventually be a lot less stressful.", "NTA. Self inflicted emotional trauma is wild", "I like what you did a LOT.  A mom has no say in what your wife does.  I was tortured by my ex in laws and my own mom has been awful the last few years.  I've completely cut off my ex in laws from my girls and I've had to threaten my mom with NC in the future if she doesn't back off.  A friend who's also a therapist once told me that some people, family or not, are like tumors.  And just like a tumor you sometimes have to cut it out and just be done with it.  Your parents might be the same.  I'd definitely go with the wife to visit her friend and just ignore your mom for awhile.  Definitely NTAH.", "I have been there with my mom too. I finally had to block her and go NC because of her toxic behavior towards me my wife and kids. She always took my older brothers side in just about everything even when shown proof that he did a thing. She didn\u2019t care.", "Your mother\u2019s toxicity is exhausting, and I am only reading your post.  I couldn\u2019t imagine her being in my life after she manipulated your sister to change her baby shower date, just to damage your plans.  NTA", "You are the A H to yourself for not going on vacation with your wife. You told your brother and he immediately told you mother. Your mother changed the shower date to make you cancel your trip. Your sister went along with it and so did you. Now, you're still stuck getting angry calls, because you broke, but your wife didn't.

Or is she preemptively concerned about them asking?", "That's the thing brother, that's all that will happen. People will be mad. For no good reason. You now know that you are at no fault, so if they're gonna be mad at you for that, fuck em. Not saying fuck em like cut them out of your life, but stop letting their undue ire affect you. \n\nIt's easier said than done, but you are gonna feel so good the first time it clicks.", "They asked her about it and kinda tried to talk her into when we went and visited during school holiday in our last year of school but it just wouldn\u2019t have worked out with us raising the littles at that time. They didn\u2019t really bring it up until a year or two later, which was at the wedding but she was just about to start her second year of pre med and was totally anti moving.

You had plans and it\u2019s not fair for you to change them because your mom is being manipulative.", "Good luck hun. If you ever want them to understand that you will not tolerate their attempts to manipulate and control, this is the way to send them that message, otherwise by giving in and doing exactly what she wants, you are in fact teaching her what she needs to do to make you obey her and she will ruin every event you have.\n\nIn terms of your wifes family - All for it as long as your wife's family isnt toxic or  emotionally abusive. You should ***not*** be pushing her to them if they are any more than she should be pushing you to obey your mom.\n\nAll it does is put her in front of abusers and will allow her to get hurt. You need to respect her lived experiences with them and not dismiss them just because they are family if you want her to respect your choices when it comes to yours.

You may explain it to me in some short words?\n\nHave a good day and i send you very best regards from Switzerland.", "I see, that's difficult that they keep pressing a difficult issue like that, especially if her relatives are pushing her away as a result. Try not to get caught into the trap of 'but it's family', to excuse behaviour that wouldn't be socially acceptable elsewhere. I'm not saying that's necessarily happening, just that it's a risk in situations like this. Some people feel like they should put up with bad treatment/situations just for 'family', where if it was a friend or coworker, they'd have put up hard boundaries or stop talking to that person altogether already! \n\nThem bringing it up only sometimes might actually feel worse to her than if they brought it up 100% every time. At least if they did that, she'd know what to expect and brace herself for it. Whereas if she isn't sure if they will or won't bring it up in each visit, it's adding another dimension of anxiety to a discussion she already is uncomfortable with. Have you tried telling those relatives that no, no moving is happening at all (or insert whatever the case is for you guys, like definitely no moving til you have kids or w/e)? If yes, how did they react to that? Did they respect your answer since then? And if you haven't been clear with them, how come? Do you think that would help the situation so your wife would know that once they have a definitive answer, they wouldn't ask again during the next visits? \n\nIf you don't mind me asking, was the 'ask once, offer accommodations, then leave her to it' system agreed on by both of you? Like, was it a joint idea/compromise? From the outside looking in, that would irritate me so much, because if I said no once, that's my answer, and offering accommodations would make me feel like a child. But if that's the system that you and your wife agreed on/decided between both of you, then that's alright. As long as she is 100% on board, and she wouldn't prefer you just taking her first answer and leaving it there. If you were the one who came up with ths asking system, then I would really recommend asking her to answer truthfully if she'd prefer it if you stopped that and just listened to her first answer, be it yes or no. She may feel like she can't tell you to stop re-asking, because she knows that you feel she should be more connected with her family", "I knew I could rely on someone with more skill than me!
