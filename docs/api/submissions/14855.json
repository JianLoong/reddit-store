My wife and I met in seventh grade and we have now been married for 3 years, meaning we got married at 19 - which my mother (55f) had a complete exponential breakdown over but that\u2019s not super important.\n\nRecently, my wife has voiced her desire to go to Miami this summer to see her sister and brother-in-law, as well as their new baby. I was all for this idea, my wife and her sis have had some issues in the past and I was super excited that she was the one wanting to see her and it wasn\u2019t me forcing her to visit, like I usually end up doing.\n\nWe had the conversation and phone call about the logistics and what not and the travel plan as well as where we\u2019ll be staying is all done. I mentioned this in passing to my twin brother, who is actually the favorite child, and evidently he passed this forward to my mum and pops, who we were were planning to tell right before we left so that we could avoid a huge conflict over it. \n\nYesterday morning my mum called be crying on the phone saying that I have betrayed her, once again and how she couldn\u2019t believe I could do this to her. I asked her what she could be possibly be talking about and she revealed to me that my sister\u2019s (she\u2019s the eldest child and is probably even with my brother for favorite) baby shower is on the first full day that we\u2019d be in Miami after travel day 1 was over. Before my wife and I started booking things, we made sure that our trip wouldn\u2019t interfere with any of our siblings, and we were completely free to be gone from the second through the eighth. I called my sis to see why she rescheduled and she told me that mum said she felt like having a shower in may was a bad idea, which makes absolutely no sense but I don\u2019t even want to get into that. We talked, and I told her that I would stay back and come to her baby shower but I knew my wife wouldn\u2019t and that nobody was going to changed my mind or her mind on that decision. My wife is still going to Miami and I am over the top excited for her, but my mother has been calling us non stop saying how rude it was that she\u2019d choose her sister over mine when we\u2019re now a \u2018joint family\u2019 , my mother hasn\u2019t met 2/5 of my wife\u2019s siblings simply because she doesn\u2019t care to. She called super late last night, going on another one of her tangents about disrespect and I finally told her that she has no say in how my wife lives her life and she should be thankful I\u2019m even going to the baby shower. Apparently this really made her sad because my father called earlier this morning saying how out of line I was but I truly don\u2019t think what I did was too bad.
