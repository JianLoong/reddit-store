Personal responsibility is something at YOU need to have. It is not something you really can use a solution to problems, for that you need to use empathy; to think about how others think about things, to understand where they are coming from.. you know: being a fucking human. We expect each and everyone to have personal responsibility but in the end; we can't force them to be good people, we can only demand that from ourselves.\n\nSo: you should think that you should have personal responsibilities of your actions and then think about others, what is most practical, safe way to carry yourself, for ex:  label your food in a pot luck. And don't make ANYTHING that has peanuts or shell fish, the importance of that is multiplied by a fucking hundred if those ingredients aren't usually use in that dish, or those ingredients are hidden, not obviously there. It is your personal responsibility to communicate so others don't get hurt. How far to take that responsibility? That is up to you, unless there is law or regulation about it, then you need to figure out if \"teaching lessons of personal responsibility\" is more important than basic fucking love for your fellow fucking humanbeings.  \n\n\nThis kind of topic is one of those that divide us humans in fundamentally two different camps, negative feedback vs positive reinforcement, combined with pro-active vs reactive problem solving.

Getting upset at OP for that is not good.", "I agree. I\u2019m from Canada and most people I know don\u2019t eat tofu if they eat meat. The perception is, if I can eat meat, why would I bother putting tofu in my mouth?\n\nI love tofu, prefer it to most meats, but am not strictly vegetarian so I have mixed them before - like tofu and shrimp go together so well. Or a tofu and cabbage and pulled pork wrap.\n\nSo, easy NAH because it\u2019s depends so much on perception and I totally get both sides. \n\nAlso, I\u2019m really hungry now.", "No! The most important thing is nobody has to put a post it note next to a Tupperware! Not for everyone to have a nice time at a potluck! /s", "But no one else did. No one else had that expectation put on them. OP is being held to a different arbitrary standard. \n\nIf the expectation was everyone labels and announces their food then great. \n\nBut why is the expectation that OP (whose cultural perspective is this is a common dish everyone knows what it is) go to every person at 20 person dinner party to tell them their dish isn\u2019t vegetarian.\n\nDid the people that made vegetarian dishes go around and tell everyone that their dish has tree nuts and it shouldn\u2019t be eaten if you have an allergy to tree nuts?", "Making OP manage their culture expectations means that their cultural expectations take precedence. \n\nWhy doesn\u2019t everyone just assume that tofu dishes have meat in them unless otherwise stated. \n\nOP made a dish from their culture. OP shouldn\u2019t have to manage other people\u2019s ignorance.", "Everyone has cultural blind spots. This could have created an opportunity for mutual learning rather than anyone getting pissed about it. OP didn\u2019t know that in some cultures tofu never has meat; others didn\u2019t know the opposite. So everyone should apologize to everyone and communicate better going forward.", "Future potlucks should have ALL dishes labeled", "Oh good god, calm yourself. Simply acknowledging that people have *different* expectations around food and communicating to prevent misunderstandings is not making anything take precedence over another. \n\nWe are talking about putting a post it note next to a bowl. There\u2019s no need to make it some kind of culture war. Everyone can take care to communicate as well as possible so that everyone has a nice time at the potluck. End of story."]}
