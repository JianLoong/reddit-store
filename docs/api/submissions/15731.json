But still it is better than for ex tofu, which quite often is the vegetarian option, has label \"contains meat\", or just \"non vegetarian tofu\". The sign of a good person is that you think of others AND that you only apply personal responsibilities TO YOU!!!!\n\nThat is the idea you have completely missed. Personal responsibility is something at YOU need to have. It is not something you really can use a solution to problems, for that you need to use empathy; to think about how others think about things, to understand where they are coming from.. you know: being a fucking human. We expect each and everyone to have personal responsibility but in the end; we can't force them to be good people, we can only demand that from ourselves.\n\nSo: you should think that you should have personal responsibilities of your actions and then think about others, what is most practical, safe way to carry yourself, for ex:  label your food in a pot luck. And don't make ANYTHING that has peanuts or shell fish, the importance of that is multiplied by a fucking hundred if those ingredients aren't usually use in that dish, or those ingredients are hidden, not obviously there. It is your personal responsibility to communicate so others don't get hurt. How far to take that responsibility? That is up to you, unless there is law or regulation about it, then you need to figure out if \"teaching lessons of personal responsibility\" is more important than basic fucking love for your fellow fucking humanbeings.\n\nThis kind of topic is one of those that divide us humans in fundamentally two different camps, negative feedback vs positive reinforcement, combined with pro-active vs reactive problem solving. I'm on the positive reinforcement and pro-active problem solving camp: that we prevent problems and try to encourage more good behavior than trying to react to things that happened and then punish from bad behavior that lead to that bad thing happening... It is a balancing act, not one or another. But the way i see these things, prevention and support causes less human suffering. And i understand that for some, they do not understand this at all, fundamentally the thinking is so different that what i say is like blasphemy; \"this guy said that bad things don't have to happen to bad people\" but i digress. I know there is great pushback against the approach that saves lives, the \"OSHA\" method of living as that also shields idiots from getting hurt and \"learning their lesson\".", "IMO in an environment with varied cultures and/or dietary restrictions/preferences, isn't it better if EVERYONE communicates the ingredients of what they've made to avoid any potential problems?", "Huh?

No garlic or onions?\n\nYes, Buddhism and its lesser known sister religion, Jainism - both originated in India and the \"no garlic no onion\" thing is very real and very much practiced today by tons of people.\n\nI'm no expert but I know there are two different cultural roots to this. One is the ancient Indian system of medicine and holistic living called Ayurveda. Foods are classified as \n\n- sattvik (peace and harmony inducing) aka most fruits and veggies except onions and garlic \n\n- rajasic (energy inducing) aka most meats and veggies with strong flavors such as chili pepper, onion, garlic\n\n- tamasic (lethargy and stagnation inducing) aka most processed foods, excessively fatty or decadent food\n\nThe idea of this food classification is not that one is bad and another is good but is just a classification of what food does to your body and what you should consume as a result. For example, if you're trying to meditate or be peaceful, you want to eat mostly sattvik foods and if you are going to do heavy physical stuff, you want to eat mostly rajasic foods.\n\nSince Buddhism and Jainism promote simple and austere living and meditation/contemplation, they encourage sattvik diet. Of course, a lot of this changed and morphed over time and distance as Buddhism got adopted by various countries and food cultures. But that's the core.\n\nJainism takes the concept of non-violence (ahimsa) to the logical extreme, way beyond even Buddhist notions. You can call it veganism but it is slightly different although the core goals are similar to veganism. Devout Jains will also not eat onions and garlic because they are grown underground and they believe that planting and digging up bulbs and root veggies kills too many insects. So even though they're vegetables, it still causes excessive cruelty to other living things. Or that's the belief system. They also do not eat other root veggies and other veggies that tend to have too many insects.\n\nInterestingly enough, Jains and Buddhists will consume milk and dairy - probably because in India, cows are very well looked after and are often treated like pets or household members. So it is not considered cruel to take some of the milk a cow produces when it is giving milk. But i digress.", "Interesting.

There are a lot of holdovers from various older dietary rules.  For example, beaver was considered \"fish\" in medieval Europe, because it lived in water and had scales on its tale.  Also barnacle geese were considered \"fish\" in northern Europe, because they hatched their eggs in the south before migrating north, so the northern Europeans never saw them reproduce, and drew the (logical, but incorrect) conclusion that they were generated in the ocean water. \n\nReally, the only way to be sure of someone's specific diet, if you are preparing food for them, is to ask specific questions.  Both for religious restrictions, cultural taboos, and things like food allergies.", "Okay but what's interesting is in some places they decided that anything in water counts as a fish.
