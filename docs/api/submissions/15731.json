But still it is better than for ex tofu, which quite often is the vegetarian option, has label \"contains meat\", or just \"non vegetarian tofu\". The sign of a good person is that you think of others AND that you only apply personal responsibilities TO YOU!!!!\n\nThat is the idea you have completely missed. Personal responsibility is something at YOU need to have. It is not something you really can use a solution to problems, for that you need to use empathy; to think about how others think about things, to understand where they are coming from.. you know: being a fucking human. We expect each and everyone to have personal responsibility but in the end; we can't force them to be good people, we can only demand that from ourselves.\n\nSo: you should think that you should have personal responsibilities of your actions and then think about others, what is most practical, safe way to carry yourself, for ex:  label your food in a pot luck. And don't make ANYTHING that has peanuts or shell fish, the importance of that is multiplied by a fucking hundred if those ingredients aren't usually use in that dish, or those ingredients are hidden, not obviously there. It is your personal responsibility to communicate so others don't get hurt. How far to take that responsibility? That is up to you, unless there is law or regulation about it, then you need to figure out if \"teaching lessons of personal responsibility\" is more important than basic fucking love for your fellow fucking humanbeings.\n\nThis kind of topic is one of those that divide us humans in fundamentally two different camps, negative feedback vs positive reinforcement, combined with pro-active vs reactive problem solving. I'm on the positive reinforcement and pro-active problem solving camp: that we prevent problems and try to encourage more good behavior than trying to react to things that happened and then punish from bad behavior that lead to that bad thing happening... It is a balancing act, not one or another. But the way i see these things, prevention and support causes less human suffering. And i understand that for some, they do not understand this at all, fundamentally the thinking is so different that what i say is like blasphemy; \"this guy said that bad things don't have to happen to bad people\" but i digress.

I'm a southern white woman, and the vast majority of recipes that actually call for tofu that I can think of also call for non-vegetarian items as well. My favorite is hot and sour soup, but there are plenty of others that have broths, meats, and gelatins. I know that there are meats that substitute in tofu for the actual meat called for, but I simply don't think tofurkey is the default use of Tofu.

Tofu is just an ingredient just like carrots and OP was not being dishonest about it she was completely open that it had pork in it. Also if people had dietary needs they should have asked everyone to label things for their restrictions.
