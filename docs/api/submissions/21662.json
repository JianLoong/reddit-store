I lost a baby boy with my ex fianc\u00e9 due to SIDS when I was 20, the baby was only 7 weeks old and otherwise completely healthy. It was devastating, but through lots of therapy, and family/friend support I've managed to move on in life.\n\nI've been a bit anxious this time around, and I've learned about a lot of things that can help prevent SIDS, one of which is cosleeping (not to be confused with bed sharing). The baby is currently in a bedside bassinet suitable up to 33lbs, whereas my firstborn was in his own bedroom from the time of birth.\n\nMy boyfriend works a high injury risk job, so it's vital he gets proper sleep during the week. He's yet to take his paternity leave and is saving it for when baby is being christened. He does also do the majority of housework when he's finished work, as well as the majority of nappy changes and is a really good dad. \n\nThe only problem is that the baby has been waking him up at night when she wakes to be fed. This led to tiredness and a mild work injury resulting in 4 stitches. Now he wants me to put the baby in the nursery/spare room we have set up for her, which I absolutely do not want to do. I offered to take over a few more of the chores so he could go to sleep an hour or two earlier and get more rest in.\n\nHe said that wouldn't work and he's on a routine that works for him. This is when I got a little annoyed for no reason. I told him he can sleep in the spare room, because there's a brand new single bed in there, but our double mattress is designed to protect his back or something like that. He told me I'm showing no compassion towards him and he's not willing to leave his bedroom and risk back pain and work injuries and the baby will be fine on her own.\n\nI told him I'm not moving the baby, or myself and if he really wants to, he can sleep in the spare room and he's now annoyed that I want to kick him out of his bed. AITA?\n\nEdit copied from a comment. With the way the single bedroom/bed is designed, I'd have to get up, take the baby into the living room to feed her and to change the nappy since its a 4.5m\u00b2 room, the changing table will not fit. I'm two weeks post c-section, and dealing with some complications from that, I'm being told to do as little as possible for the time being.\n\nEdit 2: he has no back issues, this has been confirmed by a doctor, he didn't have back issues before getting the mattress, he has no back pain. He's just fucking dramatic.\n\n\nEdit: I rang my dad, and explained the situation. My dad does not like my boyfriend due to some issues in the past, and recently, such as the fact he didn't attend the birth of our daughter because he was too drunk to, and a few other things. \n\nMy dad is going to be here in the next 10 minutes, he's going to empty out the spare room, so a single bed and a cot, and put the fancy mattress in there. I still have my \"old\" mattress, so that's going to go back into my room. I've told my boyfriend, and I've asked for the \u00a31450 of the mattress I paid back. When he gets home I'm going to have a serious chat with him about stepping up because ordering takeaway and changing two nappies a day with laundry having been done twice since our daughter was born isn't exactly that helpful. If he doesn't grow a pair, he's free to move out.\n\nEdit again: So now his fancy mattress is in the spare room, and dads been really nice and is hanging some shelves and a rail for him to hang bfs clothes off! So then in the morning when he gets up for work, he won't have to come into my bedroom and disturb me and the baby! Is this petty as all hell? Yes. \n\nMy boyfriend is also quite pissed off, but not that I moved his mattress, that I'm asking for my money back. He'll be home at about 4:30pm, so I'll give another little update then", "created_utc": 1688801562, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14tx99r/aita_for_suggesting_my_boyfriend_sleep_in_the/", "score": 33, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Yeah this kid gonna grow up with his parents seperated.", "NTA!\n\n~~INFO:~~\n\nSo, if I have this straight: Baby's nursery doesn't have enough space for the changing table because it is too small and the single bed takes up too much room. You can change and feed baby in the master bedroom or the living room, but not the nursery? And bf doesn't like the new single bed because the mattress on the double is better for his back?  Is that right?\n\nFirst off, is there is a reason you can't get a different, more supportive mattress, for the single bed? Or is it the space/length provided by the double that your boyfriend prefers?\n\nDoes your boyfriend actually have a bad back/back condition which could be triggered/made worse by the single bed? Or is his refusal to \"risk back pain\" just an excuse without basis in his medical history.\n\nI see that you've commented your boyfriend's job is high risk of injuries due to working with sharp objects. Does he not have use/option of kevlar gloves and/or other PPE to minimise that risk?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdited (along with verdict above) to add: When I'd asked the questions, I was already strongly inclined towards NTA. But I'd been open to the possibility that your boyfriend might have had medical justification for his refusal to use the spare bed, or that in the sleep deprived state often seen with new parenthood that you might have overlooked a solution which could have made this a N A H situation.  \n\nBut having seen your answers and other comments, it seems clear your boyfriend's selfish wish to keep to the master bedroom and send baby and you to the nursery has no medical justification. \n\nYour wish, on the other hand, to keep baby in the same bedroom has solid basis medical advice you've received following your c-section, standard advice to parents (at least in the UK, I'm not sure about advice given in other countries), and your personal history.  You have three times the justification to not do as he wishes.\n\nYou are very much NTA.\n\nAnd one more thing. Congratulations on the birth of your baby girl!", "NAH honestly it\u2019s tricky as nobody is really in the wrong. If the mattress in your bed wasn\u2019t designed to help his back I\u2019d say your boyfriend should suck it up and just use the spare bed.\n\nHaving said that, he also needs to understand the reason you\u2019ve got your baby by the bed. You need to feed and comfort with as little movement as possible AND you\u2019re looking out for your baby\u2019s health given your previous experience. The least worst option is for him to sleep separately, at least on work days.\n\nEDIT: yeah switching to NTA seeing your bf doesn\u2019t have back issues. I slept separate from my wife and daughter when I was back at work on a futon on the floor in the spare room and considered myself lucky to be able to get a relatively decent night\u2019s sleep. Your bf will learn soon enough that parenting is about sacrifice and this is barely a sacrifice at all.", "why wont you sleep in the spare room?

On reddit, if you're a woman, you're not given the benefit of the doubt, so I would add the triple salary thing in your post. It shouldn't be relevant, but sexism makes it so.\n\nMy opinion: you're not doing anything wrong. The baby is the most important person in thay house and the baby needs you.

Now I'm breastfeeding the baby, while having orders to take it easy and do as little physical activity as possible in order to heal properly because I've got an infection, and I've had the incision reopen a couple times. And he doesn't do most of the nappies. Between the time he comes home from work and the time he goes to sleep, there may be one or two wet nappies. He leaves the house at 7am in order to go to the gym until half 8, starts work at 9 and finishes at in or around 4.

The single mattress is an Emma original, it cost about \u00a3300, so while it's not S Tier, it's not the worst. Adding a headboard, even one that would only be 1/2 inches wide to the bed to prevent stuff falling would make it so we can't open the door, it's just about sliding past as in. \n\nThe mattress that was on the double bed before he went and bought the new one was one I got from Harvey Norman back in the beginning of 2021 on sale for about \u00a3900.

I don't know anyone who has one. We always just had a roll-out mat and got changed on the mats, which would be put on the table/floor/bed or whatever surface was nearest or most convenient for whoever was doing the changing. If your main issue with you staying in the spare room is that you'd have to carry her from the spare room to the living room to get to the changing table, and that's unnecessary movement when you should be resting, is there anywhere you can use a roll-out changing mat in the spare room, in a way that isn't uncomfortable or dangerous for you so soon after C-section? \n\n(NTA, Mainly I'm just sorry he's putting his own health needs above yours and the baby's health needs, without trying to think of a fix himself, but if you could change her in the spare room, at least you wouldn't have to listen to him complaining about it.)", "Why not just use a  changing mat on the single bed?

He moves, and keeps his mattress", "That's one of many, it started as a running joke. The first thing I said when she came out and was put on me was get it off me it not mine. I don't know why I said that, but there's a video of it and it's pretty funny. \n\nCalled her a parasite for the first 6 months of cooking her. She has more positive nicknames too, such as Queen (Her Name), madam squish, poopyhead. I'll never say the negative ones when she's old enough to have a grasp on them and understand what they mean.", "I can't laugh without extreme pain right now, I change the baby standing up, rather than leaning over because that's the not painful option. We've got one, the table was a last minute purchase when I realised I couldn't even bend over, and I really *really* don't want to change a poop nappy on the same surface I prepare food on, and I'd still have to carry her from the spare room even further into the kitchen", "She\u2019s recovering from a C-section and is experiencing complications. How hard do you think it\u2019s going to be for her to bend over to change the baby on the bed? The changing table is that height in order to be as convenient as possible for their caretaker. She is recovering from surgery and taking care of a newborn so her needs should be the priority. If he\u2019s so afraid of injury he can go to the spare room. He\u2019s not even the breadwinner of the family, she is.", "Why would you force your child to grow up in a country they might not like when they grow up? \n\nWhy would you publicise your children's names without their consent? I hope you have absolutely no photos of them children on the Internet by the way, because they're not old enough to choose that for themselves. \n\nI also hope you didn't choose their names for them, because they may not agree with that.", "Poor kiddo.", "wow you sound like a nightmare, completely YTA for this attitude. Especially when you literally said he needs as much sleep as he can get to stay safe at work and him sleeping in the spare will not give him that. You need to learn to compromise otherwise i dont see ya'll lastin very long.", "I\u2019m some stranger on the internet you ask a question of and I just pointed out inconsistencies and contradictions in your story. At the end of the day it\u2019s not my monkeys not my circus. Good luck.", "So long as he has a bed frame and it\u2019s not just a mattress on the floor, it\u2019s a very good compromise", "That really does not sound funny at all. \n\nA lot of your comments are coming off as very aggressive", "Fair point, I just didn't know whether the spare room set-up meant that bending would definitely be required to change her there (e.g. I have memories of people kneeling by beds to change babies rather than leaning over them, but don't have a clue whether that's possible with a C-section).\n\nI'm really sorry your partner isn't acting like a partner. Sounds like he needs to figure out a mattress topper for the single bed or something.", "Yeah all these men twisting into pretzels to figure out how this woman who is two weeks post c section and doing 100% of night duty can make sure she and baby annoy husband less. It's just gross. God forbid he be inconvenience at all", "why do u have to be an ass ?", "Him sleeping in the spare room will give him that, literally read the comments. It's not up to his standard. I'll either give him the 42% of the double mattress he paid, or he can give me the money I paid for something that isn't needed, our old mattress was fine and less than 2 years old. He's just a whinge bag with a need for luxury items. \n\nThe single mattress is an Emma original, pretty comfortable. Why is his sleep more important than mine, when I'm the one spending 22 hours a day with the baby while he does 2 hours of the work at best? I could end up falling asleep while feeding the baby because I am so tired and it could cause her death, or sleep through an emergency if i lose any more sleep than I'm currently losing between a literal newborn and everything else?\n\nSo he got a tiny booboo THAT WAS HIS OWN FAULT. His standard of mattress is a \u00a32500 one with a little wedge that he could have got in IKEA at the top and a tiny bit more firm than a \"normal\" one. He can take the fucking mattress, and put it in the floor in the other room for all I care, but I'm not moving", "He's not getting the frame. I'm putting my old mattress on it. The frame isn't specialised, and why would I sleep on a mattress on the floor? If he wants a frame he can use the single frame", "Maybe not to you, but that's okay", "Hold up. You said he does the majority of chores and diaper changes\u2026.now you\u2019re the one getting credit for 22 hours a day with the baby?", "\u201cWhy would I sleep on a mattress on the floor\u201d\n\nYou think it\u2019s reasonable for your bf to do so.", "I know this will sound condescending as fuck, but seriously, get therapy. \n\nAll of your comments are dripping with resentment toward your bf, maybe deservedly? But why tf have a baby in that case. And like I said, you come off as very aggressive.\n\nI know having a newborn is hard. I have been there. Maybe you need some extra support", "My boyfriend doesn't have a 25cm long infected wound across his abdomen. He also didn't nearly die due to blood loss, or from sepsis. He was in the pub when the was happening, he can stand up and move around. I hate to make pain a competition but he got 4 stitches and expects to be treated like a critical patient. \n\nAlso, you expect my baby to sleep on the floor? Because she's not leaving my side.", "Lol at the resentment. Go to counseling asap", "I don\u2019t expect you to sleep on the floor, you expect your bf to.\n\nYou should both just buy an extra bed board or look into him moving to his parents or something until he can sleep in his bed again (assuming you own the home and he doesn\u2019t)", "I own the flat, I cover about 75% of the bills, I do the vast majority of childcare, before the baby was born I was responsible for the majority of housework. \n\nI expect him to sleep on the floor because he expected me to get up with our newborn multiple times in a night, and regardless of whether she's in the room on her own or I'm there with her, I still have to take her into the living room and kitchen to change and feed her despite the fact that I needed my mum here to help me get up to go to the bathroom up until about Wednesday, because he refused to take the time off of work to do so. I'm okay with doing night feedings and changes, because that's what I signed up for when I decided to become a parent, but so did he, and if he can't adjust his life and his schedule to suit our child, then he needs to adjust his sleeping arrangements and pay for his own bed frame.\n\nThe more I've sat on this, the more I've seen a lack of care from him over the last number of years alone. When he was out of work, he'd stay up until 4am on discord calls,  gaming, watching movies, drinking, knowing full well I was a key worker who was (at the time) working 12 hour days beginning at 7am, and when asked to quieten down I was told he was only having the laugh. I put up with two years of that.\n\nI think sleeping on the floor is only fair."]}
