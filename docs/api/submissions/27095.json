Saddie has shamelessly shown her disgust towards me.

I was hesitant at first but then I decided to go. Everyone treated me kindly and were very welcoming, except from SIL, that seemed pissed off for the fact that I was here. Firstly we got to a restaurant, we ate breakfast and everything was going smoothly. Until Saddie began to speak. She started to do passive-aggresive comments that were obviously towards me. I didn't pay attention, my indifference clesrly got Saddie more pissed off and then she started to do more direct comments, regarding class and ethnicity.\n\nI bit my tongue for the sake of peace. Bad idea, because Saddie continued with her BS comments. Nobody told her anything, not even my boyfriend. I was expecting Adam to stick up for me but he never did. At a point I took him to a more close place and asked him to please talk with his sister and put her a stop, that her comments were making me uncomfortable. Adam laughed at it and say I was being oversensitive, that Saddie was just hormonal because of her pregnancy. \n\nMore later, Saddie continued with her subtle insults and weird fixation for me. I snapped and told her to stfu and that she was being a total b*tch. Saddie got silent after that and began to cry cocodrile tears, MIL got angry and told me not to speak that way to her daughter. Adam also got annoyed and told me I had no rights to insult Saddie. I never felt more freaking humiliated in my life.\n\nI told Adam that I've got enough and that I will be returning home.

The fact that Adam or his parents cannot be bothered to so much as even just tell the sister to lay off of you is very troubling. Like how hard is it for them to change the subject? Rug sweeping isn\u2019t much better than their reaction here, but at least it\u2019s something. You deserve better than this family. You\u2019re the same age as my son.

But you don\u2019t have a SIL problem. You have a boyfriend problem. Adam should have said something waaaaay back, after her first comment ever. They never said something about her racist comments so they must agree with her. So sorry for you to find out your boyfriend is not going to back you up ever. Is this how you want to spend your life? Constantly being put down by a racist woman and your boyfriend not even telling her to stop and even defending her?\n\nPregnancy is not even a thing in this situation. I have been pregnant and it made me a lot of things (emotional over everything, especially puppies, crying because I couldn\u2019t pick something up) but it has never made me racist. So she has always been like that and is using the pregnancy as a cover up for her bad behavior.", "NTA. You were right to call her that. Everyone let her insult you and be racist but turn on you the moment you reply. You asked Adam for help and he laughed, it is time to call him an ex.", "YTA  (actually SIL is also an Ah)\n\nYou refused to engage in an adult way and then exploded and then ran away.\n\nYou could have said \u201cwhen you said *repeat her exact words* were you trying to upset me?\u201d\n\nWhen she says \u201cno\u201d, you just say \u201cI\u2019m glad you weren\u2019t doing it deliberately.  So now you know that saying *repeat her words* is upsetting for me, could you not do it again please\u201d\n\nThat sets the scene for the family.  You haven\u2019t accused her, and you\u2019ve made culturally appropriate standard setting statement.  \n\nThe family see that she got a very polite warning.  She won\u2019t be able to play innocent.\n\nWhen she does it again, just repeat.  In particular the expression \u201care you trying to make me feel \u2026\u201d and inserting unwelcome or upset, fat, ugly (whatever her insult was implying) is VERY effective.  You must remain calm though. Don\u2019t try to win the interaction.\n\nAfter a few times, her family will start to notice and see her tricks.\n\nOnly after several repeats over a few days of this, would you be justified in the eyes of your in-laws to explode.\n\nCommunicating under pressure (rather than screaming and running away), are skills to develop .  They\u2019re very useful in both your personal and professional life.\n\nI strongly recommend you find someone on YouTube (like Dan\u2019s communication skills), and start practicing.", "[deleted]", "ESH\nYour SIL is clearly being offensive, and your BF shouldn\u2019t just dismiss your feelings.
