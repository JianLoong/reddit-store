My mom and dad usually are the main caretakers for the kids when my sis and BIL go out of town but occasionally my other sister watches them. I do not live in the same state as them and I happen to be visiting for the holidays along with my partner. \n\nSo this weekend my parents and I guess my partner and I by extension were going to be watching the boys while sister and BIL fly to Miami for three days. Everything was set until Monday when both boys started throwing up and showing signs of fever. Now both my father whom has Parkinson\u2019s and my partner who has MS have crappy immune systems so they get sick it seems to affect them harder. So Dr says flu but by Friday boys should be on the mend. \n\nSister tells us wed boys are feeling much better and we will see you Friday. Well yesterday I stopped by sisters to pick up something I promised I\u2019d return for her and I see both boys listless on the couch. She realizes she\u2019s been caught and lies about them just waking from naps. When I press her she says, it\u2019s a setback but I swear they will be better Friday. \n\nShe tells me not to tell mom and dad and they\u2019ll be fine. Of course I tell my parents because my mom is very careful with dad and because I need to warn my partner. My mom calls her and tells her that they won\u2019t be watching the kids. Sister calls me, berates me from ruining her trip, calls me a shit starter on Facebook.\n\nNow her, my BIL who wanted to get away for a few days, his mom and my other sister are telling me I should have stayed out of it.", "created_utc": 1670546004, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zghgt8/aita_for_telling_my_parents_not_to_watch_my/", "score": 56, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The fact she'd risk your parents health is gross.", "Good lord, NTA.  Sister knew this was a deal-breaker which is why she lied about it.  Here's the thing:   you would never forgive yourself if something happened and you had said nothing.", "NTA.\n\nYour sister seems dreadful if she is willing to put your parents and your partner at risk so she can go on a trip. I have family like that, they suck. Trips can be rescheduled.", "NTA, my sister does this to my parents too. It's incredibly selfish to risk someone's health, especially your own parents, for the sake of vacation.", "NTA\n\nSo their trip was more important to them than your immunocompromised parents\u2019 health. That\u2019s something that everyone should keep in mind. \n\nIf your other sister will occasionally watch the boys, and since she\u2019s giving you grief over warning your parents, is she willing to change her plans in order to watch them??", "NTA\n\nYour sisters, big entitled AHs. Did sister #2 or his mom offer to watch the kids? Didn't think so.", "NTA. Who leaves 2 sick children with immune compromised people so they can get away for 3 days?\n\nWhat if the illnesses get worse?  \n\nWhat a shitty mom. Her preschool children are sick, worry about the lil vacay later. \n\nWow. Should post this in entitled parents sub.", "NTA. Don't take chances with people with compromised immune systems.", "NTA, your sister should never recover from the shame. Imagine risking lives because you need to party.\ud83d\ude44", "NTA\n\nYour sis and BIL are the AHs. How selfish of them to try to leave thier sick kids with someone they know has a weak immune system. The other people saying you're the AH need to step up and take care of the kids if they think it's so important that your sis and BIL shouldn't miss their trip to keep their own sick kids.", "NTA - your sister showed her true colors. She\u2019s willing to get your husband and her own father potentially very sick, all because a three day getaway to Miami is more important to her. Being a parent means having to cancel plans when the kids get sick. Tough luck. \n\nShe got caught in a lie and instead of taking responsibility for her actions, she\u2019s lashing out at you. You did the right thing by informing your parents and preventing a possibly very bad outcome. Don\u2019t feel bad about it for a second.", "NTA ... how could you stay out of it.  It would directly impact on you.  They are selfish to think that it would be ok to put small sick kids into a house with your father and partner.", "NTA\nWhat an incredibly selfish reason to put your parents at risk.", "NTA at all. Aside from the potential danger of illness to two immunocompromised people, your sister doesn't appear too concerned about her sick children.", "Nta - but your sister sure is. Her vacation is not worth risking the health of her father and your partner.", "NTA hands down. Your sister is a major AH for prioritizing a vacation over her own children and putting others at risk in the process. YIKES.", "NTA\n\n I cannot believe your sister would risk her father's amd your partner's health like that.", "NTA good lord what is wrong with them? The kids were SICK and had no business being around others at all. Both parents were going to dump off 2 sick toddlers onto people with chronic diseases and their caregivers! They are huge AH and anyone defending them is too. Why didn\u2019t the defenders step up and take on 2 sick kids?", "NTA she knows they have compromised immune systems and was happy to dump them on them anyway, she got caught thank goodness, maybe she should have used birth control if CBA with the responsibility of children.\n\nAs for her Facebook call-out, I\u2019d explain exactly why you \u201cshit stirred\u201d and let everyone know what she is \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\n\nHer MIL and sister are likely only worried babysitting will get landed on them instead \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\udc4d\n\nOh I see in comments other sister is happy to dump ill children on them too, yeah nuff said!!\n\nYour parents now need to say they\u2019ll have them for visits, short ones, if aren\u2019t ill but the 24/7 babysitting expecting is now done, thank goodness your mother is growing a spine!! It\u2019s a shame you don\u2019t live closer to ensure it keeps growing but am sure you\u2019ll be in contact pushing!!", "NTA besides putting your dad and your SO at risk. How do they sleep knowing their sick kids are not with them?\n\nMy mom literally lays awake all night having trouble sleeping when my sister a had really bad cold last month and my sister is 25 and lives across the country.", "NTA.

NOTHING is more important than the health of your family, and if both dad and SO have low functioning immune systems, than it isn't fair for sister/bil to expect y'all to care for sick kids. This is the risk parents run by having kids, and the kid's/rest of your family's health is more important than a vacation. Just the way it is.", "Nta\nA simple response on her facebook post about how she was going to lie to your parents about the kids and that your dad has Parkinsons and it could kill him should be enough to shut her up.", "**NTA** \n\nHow would you parents have \u201chandled it\u201d if they did not know your sister has lied?\n\nYour sister was willing to risk her own father\u2019s health and your partners - not mention abandoning her poor sick children \u2014 just for a vacation. \n\nYou are a *hero* for stepping up.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You have to deal with that pair and their flying monkeys, but I'm pretty sure I'd be ripping new ones and telling them to shut their pie holes as their callous indifference to the health of others is not appreciated.", "Absolutely NTA.", "NTA.  You did right.", "NTA. Why can't they get a sitter instead of putting multiple people's health at risk?", "NTA.  I have MS and you know what?  My kids wouldn't dream of doing this to me.

I'm a parent. I get how hard that would be for your sister, BUT you can't get people sick because you want to take a trip. I've canceled SO many fun things because the kids were sick.

Your other sister should have offered if she felt you were wrong in warning your parents.", "NTA ofcourse. But why dint any of these family members who are pissed at you come take care of the kids. Don't tell me they were busy, don't live nearby, because those are just inconveniences not health risks like it would have been for your dad and partner.", "NTA your sister is the AH for selfishly lying.

What kind of AH would put that much risk on other humans? Unreal. \n\nThey\u2019re selfish to put your dad and partner at risk of serious illness simply because they want a vacation. They need to grow up. It\u2019s despicable that they\u2019d risk harming others in such a manner. \n\nThis was a choice they made when they decided to have kids.
