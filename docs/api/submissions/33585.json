I was born in the US and my sister, Michelle (37F)  still lives there, she has two sons as well, her sons are Truman (15M) and Riggs (11M)\r  \n\r  \nEvery other year, we switch locations for Christmas. Last year, Christmas was hosted at Michelle\u2019s, this year it will be hosted at my place. Michelle and her family arrived on Saturday, so they\u2019ve been here about a week.\r  \n\r  \nWhen they got here, we gave Truman and Riggs some gifts, these were not Christmas gifts but a few things we picked up over the course of the year for them, they will be getting their Christmas gifts from us on Christmas.\r  \n\r  \nRiggs got some jerseys for British Basketball League teams we found in a charity shop (it\u2019s like a thrift store in the U.S.) and we also got tickets to see a game on Sunday. Basketball is a minor sport here, soccer/football is the big sport here. Neither of my sons play sports, no one else in the family does either, while Riggs' entire personality is sports, and we do try to understand him though. We got Truman some Star Wars, Pokemon and Dungeons and Dragon stuff.\r  \n\r  \nOn Sunday, while we were at the basketball game, we sat next to this Pakistani boy (13M), him and Riggs were really bonding, the main thing they talked about was basketball but they also asked about each others cultures. They followed each other on Instagram after this.\r  \n\r  \nOn Monday, Riggs and the boy were talking over Instagram DMs and said they wanted to meet up again, Riggs asked me if it was ok to invite the boy over, which I agreed to. The boy lives about 20 minutes away. The boy came over with some food he had his parents make, as Riggs had expressed interest in it. \r  \n\r  \nThis is when the issues with Truman stated, as I was getting ready to plate the food, Truman asked why there was \u201csmelly food\u201d in the dining room, I told him to stop but he just laughed. Riggs and the boy ate some of it and then went downstairs to watch some DVDs that this boy had gifted Riggs, these were Pakistani films. When Truman went downstairs to get something, he saw the film and started mocking the accents, this is when Riggs came up and was getting very emotional.\r  \n\r  \nI told Truman to apologize and he refused. I went to talk to my husband to see what to do, and we came up with a plan. We told Truman that if he wanted to stay here and open his gifts, he would need to write a report on Pakistani culture, why his actions were offensive and how he can repair the harm he caused. We also told him he needed to write it on a typewriter we have, rather than on a modern computer and that he\u2019d have to use physical books as a source. \r  \n\r  \nTruman is complaining this is a \u201ccruel and unusual punishment\u201d, I know Michelle isn\u2019t happy about this either, but is biting her tongue in front of me. We also overheard Truman talking to his friends on the phone that we were punishing him for \u201cbeing a white boy\u201d, we are also white though.

I think this is not a punishment but an excellent opportunity for Truman to get his head out of his *ss and actually experience that actions have consequences. I do not understand that the mother is not on board. She is dodging a bullet. She very nearly raised a racist.", "INFO\n\n> she has two sons as well, her sons are Truman (15M) and Riggs (11M)\n\n... did she actually name her child after Mel Gibson in Lethal Weapon?", ">write it on a typewriter ... and that he\u2019d have to use physical books\n\nNice touch. NTA.", "NTA it's reasonable. \n\n>punishing him for \u201cbeing a white boy\u201d,\n\nAre you SURE he isn't American? It sounds like a common self victimization pattern we deal with here.", "Your sister is the AH. She obviously raised a racist because she is one herself, but she also allows a 13yo to have a cell phone and Instagram, which is a huge example of neglectful parenting.\n\nYour punishment was not cruel but it was unusual for sure. Forcing a kid to write a report is a bit much, and you should probably find a more hands-on, direct way of combating his racism. Telling him to do it himself in this way will likely just make him resentful and potentially more racist because kids are dicks when they don't get their way.", "NTA as he clearly needs to learn about other cultures - but going with the typewriter and the physical books is a bit much. I'd also guess that the physical books might actually be pretty racist themselves especially if they're a bit outdated.", "NTA, sadly it was your sister's job to teach both her sons how to behave as a guest in someone else's home. She apparently failed with one.", "NTA\n\npunishing him for \u201cbeing a white boy\u201d\n\nI'd be worried about what kind of friends he has, as should his parents.", "NTA-  I loved hearing about your nephew sharing cultures with his new friend.  That gives me hope for the future.  I agree Truman needs to learn this lesson right away and I was with you all the way up until you included the typewriter and books only because they are not going to add to the overall takeaway that was intended as far as I can see.  I feel like you were golden, and then  you added extra work for him and yourselves. Now you\u2019ve probably signed yourselves up for constant typewriter ribbon fixes and then there\u2019s having to deal with white out etc.  in the digital age that is practically a craft project! Overall I think this is a smart and fair assignment and I\u2019m glad your sister is not undermining you though I wonder why she didn\u2019t take the lead on the discipline.", "If he told his friend you're punishing him for being a white boy, then he's already soaking up white nationalist ideology.\n\nI think you should have a talk with Michelle about this and outline your concerns. Which is pretty much all you can do, aside from your punishment which is stellar, kudos for that.\n\nThe reason I think talking to your sister would be worthwhile, is because Riggs is such a sweetie and because she may not have liked your punishment but she accepted it.\n\nNTA. Good luck.", "NTA. I'd love to hear Michelle explain why Truman's behavior is OK. The fact that he's angry means you picked a punishment that has gotten through to him, which is the point. Thanks for being willing to stand up for what's right.", "NTA. And if the mum doesn't like it she can write one too.", "NTA but you should really talk to your sister. Find out her take on this. It\u2019s not really your place to discipline her child, but you could easily withhold gifts if you want.", "NTA very iconic.", "NTA. Your nephew is an ignorant racist, although your punishment is a bit weird (a culture report... written with a typewriter and books??) but not undeserved. I feel like the real lesson he needs to learn is putting himself in another person's shoes and realising disrespect and rudeness is wrong. I'm not sure that writing a resentful essay on 'culture' will necessarily do that and it might be worth revising your plan.\n\nWhy don't you have a chat with him about ignorant stereotypes that people have of americans, and ask him how he would feel if somebody mocked him based on those. I suspect he's not even thought about it. How americans are all fat, unhealthy, uneducated, untravelled, loudmouthed, ignorant religious fundamentalists who go around shooting anything they don't like, and eat a diet of grease, fake plastic cheese and sugar. With a hillbilly idiot accent to match... ask him if it would really wind him up to have somebody apply those horrible stereotypes to him.\n\nOn a positive note, you could take him to your local curry house whilst he's visiting and thereby educate him that the 'smelly food' is in fact delicious, bordering on an adopted national cuisine.", "[deleted]", "Mocking other cultures has consequences, those consequences don't include presents.

You took a good idea (apologizing) and turned it into a spiked club (writing report on a typewriter using books instead of a keyboard and online resources). Your sister is not happy with what you are doing but is biting her tongue, probably in part because you have now made them feel like prisoners in your home, and partly out of respect to you. Ask yourself this; if you lived near their home, would your sister go home or stay after this incident?  Truman is clearly being a teen AH. So are you.

That's not bitterness and resentment; that's how the human brain works. That's also not a moral good, \"actually.\" It's patting yourself on the back- especially if you're white, like OP's family is. This isn't the Pakistani family who took too much shit from this kid and is teaching him to either show respect or back off- that's not \"bullying racism out of someone,\" either. That's self-defense. This isn't self-defense. This is a bunch of white people who got embarrassed because he was rude to their other guests, and it upset his brother.\n\nThe issue, \"actually,\" is that this isn't bullying. This is discipline. Having a kid write an essay without a computer is a pretty normal and relatively harmless form of punishment as long as the kid really was wrong, which he clearly was. The question, \"actually,\" is whether-or-not it was OP's place to do so, or did the sister need to be the one to give out the punishment?

That is exactly what I said, you just made the same point with extra words and changed the tone to make it sound like a disagreement. \n\nI think combating bigotry is everyone's responsibility. She can't force the kid who isn't hers to write an essay, she doesn't have the authority, but no, I actually don't think she needed the mother's permission to scold and punish him in this context. If I'm babysitting a kid and they say something bigoted, I'm going to lecture and shame them without consulting a parent because it is a matter of humanity, not parenthood.", "Misread of my intent.
