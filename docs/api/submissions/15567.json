(I took a year off to help with family and to take care of my mental health) A week later, she tells me that she found a VR place that was open for my birthday and made reservations for us to go which I was ecstatic about. She knew how much I loved VR and her making the reservation was a good thing. A few days before my birthday, she calls me from her job and tells me she canceled our reservation to go on a \u201cdate night\u201d with her boyfriend. When I asked her why, she said it was the only day they could get a table for the restaurant. I told her she had made a promise to spend my birthday with me and now she\u2019s breaking it. She then said to get over it and spend the day with my gf. (My gf works for a cruise line and is out of country until July) I ended up spending my birthday alone and made a post on social media calling my mom out for abandoning me on a milestone birthday. My family is now divided. Half are siding with me, and the others are saying I\u2019m selfish and I went too far making the post. I haven\u2019t taken it down yet. So, am I the asshole here?\n\n\nSmall disclaimer: this is a pattern of her\u2019s that has been going on since I was 12.

You have every right to make a post. You did not go \u201ctoo far\u201d. Don\u2019t light yourself on fire to keep others warm. Keep the post up, and I would start making strong boundaries against people like this. They need a punching bag to put all of their insecurities on (which is you. Which is so horrible. You don\u2019t deserve that). Don\u2019t be their punching bag. They love to watch drama unfold.\n\nI\u2019m not a big believer of \u201cdon\u2019t air out dirty laundry\u201d. There wouldn\u2019t be needing to \u201cair out dirty laundry\u201d if there truly was nothing wrong. I went through narc abuse and my dad would always tell me to \u201cnever air out dirty laundry.\u201d Fuck that. He knew what was going on in the household and he would rather have *me* be silent (I was the scapegoat and I was the only one standing up to the narc abuse) then get any kind of help.

In my family, whoever\u2019s birthday it is gets to either chose a restaurant to go to, or if they like a certain meal, my mom or myself make it. For my 20th I wanted to go to a Mexican restaurant for dinner. I got home, my family was gone. I called my parents (not my brothers because cell phones weren\u2019t a regular thing for teenagers then) a few times but couldn\u2019t get a hold of any of them, so I ended up having some frozen meal. Hours later my parents and brothers came home, my parents were a little drunk. Apparently they went to the restaurant I had wanted to go to, my brothers assumed I\u2019d be meeting them there. My parents didn\u2019t say anything about my birthday. Years later they confessed they\u2019d forgotten, but only after I mentioned to my grandparents and aunts/uncles that they forgot it. I don\u2019t regret \u201cshaming\u201d them for it, I see it as holding them accountable. I\u2019d tried telling them my feelings were really hurt, they tried saying there was a miscommunication, but I explained we were really clear about the plan (it was also on the family calendar), and they confessed they forgot completely and we\u2019re sorry.\n\nAll in all, you\u2019re NTA. It sucks being forgotten about. It sucks being ditched for a \u201cbetter\u201d night. But it sucks even more when it comes from your parent.", "NTA, not only did your mom cancel last minute but she was the one who offered in the first place. Does she do this to you a lot?\n\nThat said, while I don't think posting on social media makes you an A H it is unclear what you wanted to happen when you did that? Folks tend to look down on others who share personal info like that, and it's unlikely it'll make your mom change her behavior or apologize so even tho I don't think you're an A H for expressing your hurt and frustration you maybe have harmed yourself with this", "Your mom is a AH and you have every right to feel slighted.  I don't know that posting about your personal issues on socials is the right way to go though.  I get that your feelings are hurt but the drama is now extending through the family and going to cause more problems and hurt feelings going forward. You should probably delete the post and try to reach out to your mom for resolution.", "Maybe I'm petty, but I'm going to go against the grain and say NTA. I know what it's like to have family abandon me on my birthday. One year when I was a teenager, we didn't have anything planned, but I got home and found out that my parents and sister went out to eat. Without me. On my birthday. \n\nI was crushed, but I wanted to avoid conflict, so didn't say anything. Now though, I wish I would have called them out on it, as well as all the other birthdays and situations that they ignored, hurt, or took advantage of me.  \n\nI'm still working on standing up for myself when it comes to them, but part of that is also showing others that my parents aren't who they portray themselves as. In my situation, social media wouldn't help with that, unfortunately.\n\nOP, I think it's good to expose your mom's actions to others. They only see what she wants them to see, especially on social media. Now they can see who she really is, through your experiences. \n\nYou deserve better than to be abandoned on your birthday. You deserve a great day, spent with those who actually care about you. I hope you get your day of VR, because it's a blast! Happy birthday!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If your mother is self absorbed or a narcissist, then she\u2019s probably skilled at manipulating people and victim shaming. Expect to see this, and that it will not change. My advice would be that next time, you should confide in a trusted circle rather than an undifferentiated list of people on social media.

Really awful people throughout history have had children. You should have had a loving parent, but that\u2019s not how the die fell. Accept this painful fact, and realize that this is HER failing, and not a reflection on YOU. She\u2019s neglectful because she\u2019s shallow/narcissist/or whatever her character flaw is, not because you don\u2019t deserve love and affection. Say this thousands of times if you need to, because kids tend to convince themselves they are unworthy. It\u2019s not true. Then, I want you to go out and deliberately form your own tribe. You can find someone with motherly affection to fill that need. Your own mother is incapable of filling that need. That\u2019s sad, because she\u2019s going to miss out on all the wonderful milestones and memories that only a loving mother and grandmother gets to enjoy. Her loss. Do not keep coming back like a moth to a flame, expecting your mother to cherish you, and getting hurt over and over again. You don\u2019t need to go no contact unless you want to. You could simply confine yourself to talking about the weather with an acquaintance, having firmly moved her out of the position of the person you turn to for love.

You said this is a pattern, but you also seem to enjoy spending time with her.

And if that doesn\u2019t work then what, just sit nice in your chair and say \u201cit is what it is\u201d until you go numb?? Nah, I think it\u2019s wholly appropriate to go public at that point, if she doesn\u2019t care about what you say why should you care about her shiny clean public image. If you didn\u2019t call her out in a way that mattered to her, she wouldn\u2019t think twice about how she treats you.

She shouldn\u2019t have cancelled and you shouldn\u2019t have made a social post about it IMO. Neither of you are an AH for doing what each of you did. \n\nIt\u2019s your 21st birthday. You\u2019re not a child anymore. If people can hang out with you, great. If things come up in peoples lives, oh well. Your mom shouldn\u2019t put everything aside for your birthday anymore since you aren\u2019t a kid anymore. Maybe it\u2019s just me, because I think adult birthday celebrations shouldn\u2019t be as special as kid birthday celebrations, but that\u2019s my perspective. If you have a problem with your mom cancelling all of the time then that is a different discussion and we could say she is being an AH for her constant plan cancellations, but in this specific context of your birthday she gave you plenty of notice to rearrange your schedule so this one event that we are talking about doesn\u2019t make her an AH. \n\nIf your mom is an AH for not isolating time for your birthday then your gf is in the same spectrum. I don\u2019t think either are at fault for you feeling the way you do. You should feel however you want about your birthday, and the onus is now on you to do more or less for your birthday since you are an adult and have full control of your world now.", "Mom is an asshole, but I don't think we have enough information to determine whether or not OP is an asshole.

She just hyped up the event like she did some grandiose thing, but when it came down to it she never actually followed through. \n\nI'm not sure if it's an abuse tactic or not, but I have friends who patents did this constantly. It's similar to love bombing: you tell your kids you made reservations for a fun trip, the kids are happy and excited for weeks, and you get that endorphins high of making someone happy, But you never make the reservations.

Also yes.\n\nThere is this false notion on Reddit that if your victim is an asshole, that makes it OK for you to be an asshole too.\n\nNo.  If you need to do something to *defend* yourself against an asshole, do what you need to do.\n\nBut the OP\u2019s actions were entirely gratuitous.

If someone screams at you and you opt to just walk away and block them from everything? That's being the bigger person. If someone pulls what OP's mom did, telling people about it in a frustrated way is still being the bigger person. You aren't inventing lies to attack them. You aren't getting in screaming matches to escalate things.  You are having a brief healthy venting session. \n\nAlso very important addendum to this bit. Letting things go is only suppose to be if it's the best interest of the victim. If the bitter feelings are causing problems for the victim they need to figure out a way to let things go so they aren't poisoning themselves. If it isn't creating undue toxicity in their life, its perfectly acceptable to hang onto things in perpetuity.", "\u201cI had to cut off all my friends due to them being toxic and manipulative\u201d\n\nLike calling folks out on socials?  \n\nESH.

It might sound petty to those who don\u2019t agree with airing this stuff on the Internet, but I think she\u2019s crossed enough lines by now that you have every right to do this if it\u2019s what you decide\u2019s right for getting closure, as well as having your version of the story definitively heard:\n\nOnce you get out of the house (and make sure to take ALL the paperwork you might ever need when you go- birth certificate, SSN card, anything you don\u2019t want to lose\u2026 in fact I\u2019d be squirreling that stuff away now so when you have your next living situation squared away you can just bolt) and get to your new place- send one last social media update to everybody from before saying something like\u2026 \u201cWell, considering how you recently told me you wish you\u2019d aborted me, I\u2019m going to give you the next best thing. You are now officially dead to me and you can pretend that I\u2019m dead to you too, because you\u2019ll never see me again. If you have another child with one of your boyfriends, I can only hope that they receive the love and support you denied me, and that they\u2019d actually be made to feel like  someone you wanted in your life, I hope you choose to remain childless as you find yourself now, because I would never wish the same unhappiness on another innocent child such as what you\u2019ve dealt to me. So I suppose you got your abortion after all, because you no longer have a son.\u201d Not to put words in your mouth of course, this is just how I\u2019d say it. \n\nDepending on how individual extended family members respond, you\u2019d get a pretty good idea of which you want to keep in your life, vs. which are write-offs. It\u2019s harsh but truthful, and could help quickly sort which extended family members to keep in your life vs. write off as well. \n\nAnd like I said that\u2019s a little harsh and while it\u2019s how I\u2019d handle the situation, I suggest you go with whatever works best for you.", "I\u2019m so sorry to read this. You deserve so much more!", "The other thing you might be getting is the nasty comments about  \"birthdays are really for kids, you are an adult,  quit being so touchy about it.\"\n\nThis, my friend,  is bullshit.  You never outgrow your need to be seen and valued as a human being who is worth celebrating. It's not about the presents or the cake or dinner at a fancy restaurant.  Those may be a traditional way to show someone they are valued on their birthday, but what really matters is that someone thought about something that they hope will make you happy.\n\nIt's about someone who hopes *they* make you happy. You never outgrow that need to be valued.  \n\nYour mom needs to think about this: If you weren't at least a little bit still invested with your relationship with her.... still hoping that this year will be different,  that this year she would be worthy of your trust,  that this year she would act like a mother who values and is proud of the human being that you are .... you wouldn't be so hurt.\n\n The time is approaching when you're just going to blow that candle out and throw it away. It's never an easy decision to make, which is why so many people hold on to that little candle even as it's burning them.

I'm sorry to break it to you, but that's what's going on. It's a sign of narcissistic behavior. \n\nYour mom tells you she has some grandiose plans for your event. You get happy and excited, and she gets an endorphins rush by seeing you happy. But when it comes closer to the date and you remind her, she can't lose face and tell you she didn't do it, so she lies about making other plans to \"get out of it\". She'll lie about a last minute appointment, a date night, family emergency, your grades, your attitude, your chores, her friend, your friend, etc.\n\nShe does it because it's a power control move. As a child you got overly excited, and so she could use that to either control your behavior (\"if you do x,y,z we'll do something fun\"), amd/or make herself feel like an amazing mom. \n\nShe lies about it because she still wants you to have that happy response. If she told you the truth (she procrastinated, she didn't have the money, she didn't want to, etc), then you would stop having that happy reaction. \n\nHere's why I know this is the case for you: why did she cancel your VR reservations?
