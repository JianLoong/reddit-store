(I took a year off to help with family and to take care of my mental health) A week later, she tells me that she found a VR place that was open for my birthday and made reservations for us to go which I was ecstatic about. She knew how much I loved VR and her making the reservation was a good thing. A few days before my birthday, she calls me from her job and tells me she canceled our reservation to go on a \u201cdate night\u201d with her boyfriend. When I asked her why, she said it was the only day they could get a table for the restaurant. I told her she had made a promise to spend my birthday with me and now she\u2019s breaking it. She then said to get over it and spend the day with my gf. (My gf works for a cruise line and is out of country until July) I ended up spending my birthday alone and made a post on social media calling my mom out for abandoning me on a milestone birthday. My family is now divided. Half are siding with me, and the others are saying I\u2019m selfish and I went too far making the post. I haven\u2019t taken it down yet. So, am I the asshole here?\n\n\nSmall disclaimer: this is a pattern of her\u2019s that has been going on since I was 12.

You have every right to make a post. You did not go \u201ctoo far\u201d. Don\u2019t light yourself on fire to keep others warm. Keep the post up, and I would start making strong boundaries against people like this. They need a punching bag to put all of their insecurities on (which is you. Which is so horrible. You don\u2019t deserve that). Don\u2019t be their punching bag. They love to watch drama unfold.\n\nI\u2019m not a big believer of \u201cdon\u2019t air out dirty laundry\u201d. There wouldn\u2019t be needing to \u201cair out dirty laundry\u201d if there truly was nothing wrong. I went through narc abuse and my dad would always tell me to \u201cnever air out dirty laundry.\u201d Fuck that. He knew what was going on in the household and he would rather have *me* be silent (I was the scapegoat and I was the only one standing up to the narc abuse) then get any kind of help.

In my family, whoever\u2019s birthday it is gets to either chose a restaurant to go to, or if they like a certain meal, my mom or myself make it. For my 20th I wanted to go to a Mexican restaurant for dinner. I got home, my family was gone. I called my parents (not my brothers because cell phones weren\u2019t a regular thing for teenagers then) a few times but couldn\u2019t get a hold of any of them, so I ended up having some frozen meal. Hours later my parents and brothers came home, my parents were a little drunk. Apparently they went to the restaurant I had wanted to go to, my brothers assumed I\u2019d be meeting them there. My parents didn\u2019t say anything about my birthday. Years later they confessed they\u2019d forgotten, but only after I mentioned to my grandparents and aunts/uncles that they forgot it. I don\u2019t regret \u201cshaming\u201d them for it, I see it as holding them accountable. I\u2019d tried telling them my feelings were really hurt, they tried saying there was a miscommunication, but I explained we were really clear about the plan (it was also on the family calendar), and they confessed they forgot completely and we\u2019re sorry.\n\nAll in all, you\u2019re NTA. It sucks being forgotten about. It sucks being ditched for a \u201cbetter\u201d night. But it sucks even more when it comes from your parent.", "NTA, not only did your mom cancel last minute but she was the one who offered in the first place. Does she do this to you a lot?\n\nThat said, while I don't think posting on social media makes you an A H it is unclear what you wanted to happen when you did that? Folks tend to look down on others who share personal info like that, and it's unlikely it'll make your mom change her behavior or apologize so even tho I don't think you're an A H for expressing your hurt and frustration you maybe have harmed yourself with this", "Your mom is a AH and you have every right to feel slighted.  I don't know that posting about your personal issues on socials is the right way to go though.  I get that your feelings are hurt but the drama is now extending through the family and going to cause more problems and hurt feelings going forward. You should probably delete the post and try to reach out to your mom for resolution.", "Maybe I'm petty, but I'm going to go against the grain and say NTA. I know what it's like to have family abandon me on my birthday. One year when I was a teenager, we didn't have anything planned, but I got home and found out that my parents and sister went out to eat. Without me. On my birthday. \n\nI was crushed, but I wanted to avoid conflict, so didn't say anything. Now though, I wish I would have called them out on it, as well as all the other birthdays and situations that they ignored, hurt, or took advantage of me.  \n\nI'm still working on standing up for myself when it comes to them, but part of that is also showing others that my parents aren't who they portray themselves as. In my situation, social media wouldn't help with that, unfortunately.\n\nOP, I think it's good to expose your mom's actions to others. They only see what she wants them to see, especially on social media. Now they can see who she really is, through your experiences. \n\nYou deserve better than to be abandoned on your birthday. You deserve a great day, spent with those who actually care about you. I hope you get your day of VR, because it's a blast! Happy birthday!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's because making a scene (and posting on social media is making a scene) is simply inappropriate.", "ESH, but your mother is a way bigger AH here. There\u2019s 364 other times for a date night", "Thanks", "Doesn't seem like a big deal. He can quitely delete it in a month if he doesn't want the reminder.", "To answer your question, I\u2019ve honestly lost count of how many times she\u2019s done stuff like this and worse. She\u2019s backed out of birthdays, competitions, performances, and makes up excuses every time.(I\u2019m a dancer, I do parkour, and I ran track in hs) And when I try to talk to her about it she brushes me off because nothing I say or do matters to her.", "As he stated. This is a common pattern with his mom. There is no resolution with these type of people and they deserve to be publicly blasted.", "A 21st birthday is a much bigger deal than a hard to get into restaurant. Unfortunately, I can empathize. Your mother, of all people, should understand this.", "How does publicly exposing you as an AH give your ammo to be more of an AH.", "He did and she ignored him.", "I don\u2019t really have friends and I had to drop the friends I did have because they were all toxic and manipulative, so really it\u2019s just me and my mom. But that\u2019s a story for another day", "But OP talked to her? She was dismissive of OP's feelings and told OP to get over it.", "Sounds like they did that and basically got told to shove it. While I dont agree that OP should of aired all that out online, the mom is just mad that people see shes a shit mother and doesnt care about anyone but herself. Oh well too bad for her I guess.", "My mom is really the only family I have and I don\u2019t have any friends", "I\u2019m actually a guy", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

Here I think it was appropriate.", "I disagree. If you behave like an asshole, like mom did in this case, it should have consequences. However, OP does not have many options to punish his mom. After all, he cannot ground her, deny her allowance etc. That's why a public shaming IS apprioriate in this case.", "Seriously. This isn\u2019t something that needed to be aired on SM. I don\u2019t understand why everyone thinks everything deserves to be public. Basically inviting the flying monkeys to the party. It can only lead to unnecessary drama. \n\nThere are times to use SM to handle family issues. Unless there\u2019s some major missing reasons, This is not it. \n\nBut I\u2019ll probably get downvoted here.

Just wanted to say I kind of have a mom like that (also 21 woohoo\u2728) it really sucks and I\u2019m sorry you have to go through that. I had to go low contact (almost no contact at this point) with my mom for a lot of reasons, but I wish I\u2019d started when it was just as simple as she cared more about her partner than she did her kids. It hurts but it\u2019s also helped me a lot to distance myself from her. Idk your exact situation but I just wanted to say you aren\u2019t alone if this shitty experiences", "I'm really sorry, that really sucks to have a parent who should be there for you but be & not care\n\nA few months ago my therapist had me read a book Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents...

Its past 1k now :)", "998", "That\u2019s not a pattern I have at all. The few friends I had, I had to cut off due to their toxicity.
