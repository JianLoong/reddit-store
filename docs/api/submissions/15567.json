(I took a year off to help with family and to take care of my mental health) A week later, she tells me that she found a VR place that was open for my birthday and made reservations for us to go which I was ecstatic about. She knew how much I loved VR and her making the reservation was a good thing. A few days before my birthday, she calls me from her job and tells me she canceled our reservation to go on a \u201cdate night\u201d with her boyfriend. When I asked her why, she said it was the only day they could get a table for the restaurant. I told her she had made a promise to spend my birthday with me and now she\u2019s breaking it. She then said to get over it and spend the day with my gf. (My gf works for a cruise line and is out of country until July) I ended up spending my birthday alone and made a post on social media calling my mom out for abandoning me on a milestone birthday. My family is now divided. Half are siding with me, and the others are saying I\u2019m selfish and I went too far making the post. I haven\u2019t taken it down yet. So, am I the asshole here?\n\n\nSmall disclaimer: this is a pattern of her\u2019s that has been going on since I was 12.

You have every right to make a post. You did not go \u201ctoo far\u201d. Don\u2019t light yourself on fire to keep others warm. Keep the post up, and I would start making strong boundaries against people like this. They need a punching bag to put all of their insecurities on (which is you. Which is so horrible. You don\u2019t deserve that). Don\u2019t be their punching bag. They love to watch drama unfold.\n\nI\u2019m not a big believer of \u201cdon\u2019t air out dirty laundry\u201d. There wouldn\u2019t be needing to \u201cair out dirty laundry\u201d if there truly was nothing wrong. I went through narc abuse and my dad would always tell me to \u201cnever air out dirty laundry.\u201d Fuck that. He knew what was going on in the household and he would rather have *me* be silent (I was the scapegoat and I was the only one standing up to the narc abuse) then get any kind of help.

In my family, whoever\u2019s birthday it is gets to either chose a restaurant to go to, or if they like a certain meal, my mom or myself make it. For my 20th I wanted to go to a Mexican restaurant for dinner. I got home, my family was gone. I called my parents (not my brothers because cell phones weren\u2019t a regular thing for teenagers then) a few times but couldn\u2019t get a hold of any of them, so I ended up having some frozen meal. Hours later my parents and brothers came home, my parents were a little drunk. Apparently they went to the restaurant I had wanted to go to, my brothers assumed I\u2019d be meeting them there. My parents didn\u2019t say anything about my birthday. Years later they confessed they\u2019d forgotten, but only after I mentioned to my grandparents and aunts/uncles that they forgot it. I don\u2019t regret \u201cshaming\u201d them for it, I see it as holding them accountable. I\u2019d tried telling them my feelings were really hurt, they tried saying there was a miscommunication, but I explained we were really clear about the plan (it was also on the family calendar), and they confessed they forgot completely and we\u2019re sorry.\n\nAll in all, you\u2019re NTA. It sucks being forgotten about. It sucks being ditched for a \u201cbetter\u201d night. But it sucks even more when it comes from your parent.", "NTA, not only did your mom cancel last minute but she was the one who offered in the first place. Does she do this to you a lot?\n\nThat said, while I don't think posting on social media makes you an A H it is unclear what you wanted to happen when you did that? Folks tend to look down on others who share personal info like that, and it's unlikely it'll make your mom change her behavior or apologize so even tho I don't think you're an A H for expressing your hurt and frustration you maybe have harmed yourself with this", "Your mom is a AH and you have every right to feel slighted.  I don't know that posting about your personal issues on socials is the right way to go though.  I get that your feelings are hurt but the drama is now extending through the family and going to cause more problems and hurt feelings going forward. You should probably delete the post and try to reach out to your mom for resolution.", "Maybe I'm petty, but I'm going to go against the grain and say NTA. I know what it's like to have family abandon me on my birthday. One year when I was a teenager, we didn't have anything planned, but I got home and found out that my parents and sister went out to eat. Without me. On my birthday. \n\nI was crushed, but I wanted to avoid conflict, so didn't say anything. Now though, I wish I would have called them out on it, as well as all the other birthdays and situations that they ignored, hurt, or took advantage of me.  \n\nI'm still working on standing up for myself when it comes to them, but part of that is also showing others that my parents aren't who they portray themselves as. In my situation, social media wouldn't help with that, unfortunately.\n\nOP, I think it's good to expose your mom's actions to others. They only see what she wants them to see, especially on social media. Now they can see who she really is, through your experiences. \n\nYou deserve better than to be abandoned on your birthday. You deserve a great day, spent with those who actually care about you. I hope you get your day of VR, because it's a blast! Happy birthday!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If your mother is self absorbed or a narcissist, then she\u2019s probably skilled at manipulating people and victim shaming. Expect to see this, and that it will not change. My advice would be that next time, you should confide in a trusted circle rather than an undifferentiated list of people on social media.

Really awful people throughout history have had children. You should have had a loving parent, but that\u2019s not how the die fell. Accept this painful fact, and realize that this is HER failing, and not a reflection on YOU. She\u2019s neglectful because she\u2019s shallow/narcissist/or whatever her character flaw is, not because you don\u2019t deserve love and affection. Say this thousands of times if you need to, because kids tend to convince themselves they are unworthy. It\u2019s not true. Then, I want you to go out and deliberately form your own tribe. You can find someone with motherly affection to fill that need. Your own mother is incapable of filling that need. That\u2019s sad, because she\u2019s going to miss out on all the wonderful milestones and memories that only a loving mother and grandmother gets to enjoy. Her loss. Do not keep coming back like a moth to a flame, expecting your mother to cherish you, and getting hurt over and over again. You don\u2019t need to go no contact unless you want to. You could simply confine yourself to talking about the weather with an acquaintance, having firmly moved her out of the position of the person you turn to for love.

You said this is a pattern, but you also seem to enjoy spending time with her.

Going with just your mother to the vr place is. \n\nHaving no one else to hang out with on your 21st is odd. It is objectively sad to have no other human connections outside of your mother.", "Doesn\u2019t excuse his mom making plans and then dropping them for a date. Also, not all 21 year olds act or celebrate the same way.", "This has nothing with emotional labor. This is about the fact that she not only broke a promise she made, but she had the nerve to say that she wished she aborted me afterwards and wished she had a daughter instead", "Ok, thanks. Sounds interesting.", "dude. as hard as it is, it might be time for NC. at least for a while", "I'm so sorry, I did correct it and edit the comment as soon as I realised it. I didn't read your responses beforehand.", "998", "998!", "And my axe", "What that mother did is heinous. She bailed on her kid\u2019s birthday after two years of not seeing her kid for a date night.\nAs a mother, I think OP had every right to vent.\nOP- Get yourself out of there as soon as you can, finish school and live your life for you. Just because someone is a blood relative doesn\u2019t necessarily make them family. You deserve to be loved.\nNTA!", "Maybe not everything deserves to be public, but it doesn't make anyone as AH for making it public. I agree, OP you have handled this in private, which would have been fine. But choosing to handle it in public is also okay. He was the injured party. He tried the personal route. This is a pattern of behaviour. He had every right to handle this situation as he saw fit. And that makes him NTA.", "This is not a matter of increasing drama. If mom had not faced any consequences but a pissed-off son for this shitty act, what would have stopped her from doing it again? Now she may have learned that bad behavior will backfire on her selfish ass.", "Very true, but we definitely should normalize holding people accountable too.", "Usually it\u2019s best trying to talk to the person first. OP did and the mom said get over it. I think that was the breaking point for OP", "OP tried to handle it an AH mom said \"get over it\"", "Op tried to handle it in private and mom was dismissive. Air that laundry", "Omg reading OP's descriptions of the mom made me immediately think of this book! This book was SO incredibly validating; felt like reading a book about my mom by someone who's always known her. This mom absolutely sounds emotionally immature at the least.", "I get that. But you gotta realize after a certain point. There's nothing you can say to these type of people that will resolve this behaviour. They don't respect you, so there no reason to care about anything you say. Maybe if someone she respect spoke up to her something would happen.", "But at least half the family knows it's for a reason. If she really thinks she's not in the wrong. Then there is no resolution OP can come to with her privately, and she deserves to be publicly blasted. Either he does nothing and encourages this behavior because she knows she can get away with it, or he speaks out about it.", "Mom\u2019s certainly AH, I just haven\u2019t ever met a 21 guy year old who wanted to play video games with mom", "Venting? Sure. Isn\u2019t that most of Reddit? But why did it need to be on SM? He has a gf and family. He couldn\u2019t reach out to any of them personally and vent? OP says they don\u2019t have friends, so who was the post for?  I mean, we don\u2019t know what the exact post said but it just seems a bit much for a public post. \n But I don\u2019t think OP is an AH for having feelings. But this may not be the best way to deal with those feelings.", "I guess you must have more info than I do. From the original post, I saw nothing that warranted such an escalation. \n\nThe mom doesn\u2019t seem to be the best parent (understatement). But. You can\u2019t shame someone into loving you. You can\u2019t shame someone into treating you kindly or having a conscience. You can\u2019t shame someone into caring. \n\nIf you\u2019re going to do things like this, then you should think about what your end game is. What do you really want to have happen as a result? \n\nIf it\u2019s for the person to read the words and magically turn into a completely different person? Well life isn\u2019t a hallmark movie.", "Yeah but social media is RARELY the best way to handle conflict. Better to say something vague so people know you are upset about being alone and then just answer questions in person to people that actually matter", "Agreed. That's why I don't think OP is an asshole, just that there were other better ways to handle it. OP is young though, and experience is the best teacher.", "If OP likes family arguments, I agree. Lol. Otherwise, IMO OP and their mother should not have stopped talking about this. Nothing stops OP from bringing it up a second time since it still bothers them. \n\nI grew up around communal dirty laundry. Any dispute between older sibling and younger siblings immediately prompted a family meeting and argument. It was absolutely horrendous and meant a fight every couple days. The stress was eventually a primary reason I stopped living at home. \n\nIt's a bad practice, my friend. But c'est la vie.", "I can see the point that you are making. I never said that they have to forgive, resolution for them may be going no contact...that is OP's choice.  OP should do whatever they feel is ultimately the healthiest thing for them.  From my personal experience, I wouldn't blast my personal life on socials...I learned a hard lesson in that when I was younger.  To each their own...\n\n\\*Edited to add - OP added the disclaimer after my original comment was left.  After seeing that OP added this information I would strongly encourage OP to step out of his box and start finding other people to fill the void.", "Good point.", "He said his girlfriend was working on a cruise until July, apparently the mom didn\u2019t know so she\u2019s obviously very involved.\nOP also said she\u2019s done this many times before to him. \nDepending on how late she canceled, it may have been difficult to set up something else with other friends.\nI think that the SM post may have been the catharsis OP needed. He was so excited his mom set up something nice that he really wanted to do. And she cancels it for a \u201cdate night\u201d, not an anniversary, illness, or work obligation. A god damn date night.\nI don\u2019t blame him one minute for going off. His mom sounds like she has some narcissistic tendencies and most people like that don\u2019t care unless they look bad. Unless something reflects badly upon them. \nYou also caught why OP was home from school taking a year off? Do you think this was the right time for a mom to completely blow her kid off?\nBecause I know I don\u2019t. I\u2019m glad she got called to the carpet- sounds like it\u2019s about damn time.", "Nah, I just let them go. Toxic as they may have been, I\u2019ve learned that friends come and go. Family, on the other hand is a completely different story which is why I made this post.", "Thanks for the additional info. It colors things", "No worries. It infuriates me to read something like this. His mom needs to do better. It doesn\u2019t sound like that would happen without a kick in the pants.", "I don\u2019t think it will do anything but I guess if it makes OP feel better\u2026 that\u2019s something. \n\nI posted this elsewhere, but you can\u2019t shame someone into being a better caring person. You have to be a decent person to feel shame.", "Maybe so, but it might make friends and family more aware that OP needs extra love and support. People can\u2019t help if they don\u2019t know there\u2019s a problem."]}
