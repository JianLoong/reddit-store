His choice to try putting the fire out with cups of water could have resulted in his own death if you hadn't been there to figure out something was going on.

This despite the fact that most schools talk about fire safety in class. \n\nI don't know what your long-term plan should be for him, but for this immediate issue, I think it would be wise to talk to him about HOW to not burn down the house. You could watch youtube videos showing how FAST a fire goes out of control. Practice evacuating from his room, in the light and in the dark. Practice what to do if the fire is outside the room and he's inside, and how to tell by feeling the door. Talk about how he would call 911. Does the house have a landline or would he use his cell phone? What if he couldn't find it? Is there a neighbor whose house he could knock on, to call 911? Decide on a meeting point outside the house where he can go so you know he escaped. \n\nAnother thing I did with my kids, was show them how to do a walkaround last thing at night, to ensure all doors and windows are secured, and that the stove and oven haven't been left on, and to notice any other possible hazards.  Talk about not overloading electrical circuits, making sure that nothing heavy is covering electrical cords, how to put out a pan fire or a toaster oven fire, what to do (and what not to do) if he sees an electical fire in the house. Talk about not leaving the stove, oven, or toaster oven unattended when  you are cooking, as things may catch fire when your back is turned. Show him how to use a fire extinguisher. Get a fire blanket.  \n\nAfter that, you can talk about how he shouldn't smoke marijuana in his room (or at all, that stuff kills brains cells), whether he's at your house or his dad's house. If he falls asleep with a lit cigarette, and his room catches fire, he should ask himself whether it's possible he might die of smoke inhalation before he even wakes up to the fire alarm. \n\nLast but not least, be very clear with him that if something in the house does catch fire, whether your house or his dad's, he needs to call you for help, not just try to solve the problem with one cup of water at a time, even if he's afraid he'll get yelled at.", "Your change in tone is admirable.

Maybe he needs to work off the cost of the repairs and learn how to paint walls and hang curtains for the first time?", "Did you ask about the issues he is having in the other house? Because the nephew of a friend acted this way and it was because whenever he did anything wrong his father would freak out and blow out things of proportion, he would even hit him.

And sadly to a degree he was right. He messed up and you want to kick him out. Do you realize how unsafe that kind of thing would make a kid feel?\n\nI don't see malice in his action, just major stupidity and fear. If he is smoking anything, you guys need to have a talk with him regarding that. But in general you need to tell him that when he is in trouble he needs to come to you guys and not hide it. Because when you hide it things can escalate, just like with the fire. This time he was lucky, but that might not always be the case.
