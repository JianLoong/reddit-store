Apologies in advance for formatting as I am typing on a cellphone. I\u2019m also going to post on r/weddingplanning for cross reference and other POVs. \n\nI have been in many weddings (total is 29 and I will be 27 at the time of topic wedding) as a bridesmaid where one of my duties was to keep up with/assist the bride in keeping a count for guests\u2019 food allergies or if a couple were attending but didn\u2019t want a plate for their safety food allergy wise. \n\nNow, I am anaphylactic allergic to dairy which the bride, my cousin, knows about it and knows that I had a reaction from cross contamination 2 months ago and a few more over the last 5 years (just thought I was lactose intolerant until 2018). I am not a bridesmaid for my cousin (don\u2019t care as she was one of my biggest bullies growing up - I am attending as a controlled environment for my SO to meet my mom and dad since my dad doesn\u2019t respect my NC with mom). I thought that since it will be pizza served and store bought fruit and veggie plates with ranch and yogurt and the couples\u2019 wedding website clarified that it will be one topping pizzas with cheese, allergies will not be considered in the food count (wasn\u2019t even an option on the RSVP to state an allergy), and guests with children will be allowed to go up to the buffet setup first that it would be okay for me to give my cousin a heads up that my SO and I will be attending but not eating for her food head count (SO doesn\u2019t have an allergy but is insisting he will look like an AH if he ate and I couldn\u2019t). I thought this was okay because it has been done at other weddings and maybe she would be happy about the money saving part like the other brides (some of which we are related to).\n\nI was very wrong and my cousin called me to scream at me. She asked \u201cWhat is so wrong with pizza that you don\u2019t want to eat?\u201d Since we were at a wedding just last year with same caterer so I know that even without cheese there will be dairy, I said \u201cWe just think it will be safer for me if we were to not eat at the wedding but we are looking forward to celebrating their big day with them. The following 7 minutes of her going on about how good the pizza is and that I am wrong for hating on their food choices ended with \u201cYou didn\u2019t get fat without eating pizza!\u201d\n\nI was just taken aback and just ended the call with \u201cSounds like you are having a rough day. Sorry for adding to it\u201d and promptly hung up. Now I am wondering a week later if I was the AH for even telling her that the two of us won\u2019t be eating? For my wedding in 2025, I don\u2019t care as long as you are there.\n\nEdit to add: I texted my cousin \u201cHey. Just want to give you a heads up for the head count on food that [SO] and I are attending but not eating. Looking forward to the big day.\u201d She called me roughly 2 hours later.", "created_utc": 1692709109, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15y540h/aita_for_telling_the_bride_we_will_not_be_eating/", "score": 108, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You're not in the wedding party, you have a fraught past with this woman, and the two of you clearly do not like or respect each other. I get that you have another motive for going but I don't think it's appropriate to use someone's wedding venue to play out your private family dramas either. If you're worried about your mother making a scene and feel she is less likely to do so in a public setting, then arrange to meet the two of them in a public forum like a busy restaurant. Or invite your father to come and visit you and your partner at your home. I don't know why you would want to spend time and money, going to the wedding of someone who bullied you as a child and just spent an hour screaming insults at you over the phone.

Just because she's usually NC with you doesn't mean that she can't say perfectly nasty things under her breath. \n\nI'd find a different place and time to meet with your dad. This wedding sounds like a disaster for you. And who wants to travel, dress and buy a gift for a person who calls you up and yells at you based on a dining preference. Clearly she doesn't know or remember that you are dairy-free, and she certainly could have said \"Why?\" when you said you weren't dining rather than assuming it was because pizza is fattening.\" P.S. What's with the fatshaming?! \n\nYour bully cousin is a nasty piece of work. If your dad doesn't respect your NC with your mom, does he respect you? Skip this event.

At a wedding no less, where you don't really want YOURSELF to be the center of attention when you're just an attendee. And based on your previous post, you are no-contact with your mother because she was physically abusive to you, meaning she is not someone it would be helpful to be around even in a \"controlled\" (it will not remain controlled) environment. \n\nWhat are you doing?

Really? You didn\u2019t have to call to say that you weren\u2019t going to be eating. Unfortunately? A lot of people don\u2019t even think about life threatening allergies and whilst it sucks\u2026 It\u2019s a reality for us allergy sufferers. That is why they are also AH\u2019s.\n\nAt the moment they weren\u2019t asking guests about allergies then you should have probably decided to eat prior or after.\n\nBefore anyone gets at me - I\u2019ve attended weddings and other events in the past where my allergy wasn\u2019t taken into consideration. I made sure to eat before/after but didn\u2019t bother the hosts with it because it just wasn\u2019t worth it considering the rest of the planning they were doing.

In weddings in my country you usually pay for person. You have a sit at the table, the bride and the groom pay (different for babies and kids of course). In that situation they would be paying for you not to eat, which doesn't seem right. The best solution would be for you to have an alternate dish. It doesn't sound like that's the case here, as they're just having pizza.\n\nDid you ask if there would be alternate dishes that you could eat? I wouldn't feel right with myself if a guest was to spend a whole day in my wedding and I knew they wouldn't be eating. But maybe that's another cultural difference and the reception is not that long?\n\nI'm on the fence between n t a or e s h. Your cousin is clearly the AH for how she reacted, but there are a lot of cultures nuances for me to be able to say if you're also an AH or not.\n\nOne question though, when is the wedding? Did you wait until the last minute to let her know? That would make you at least a bit of an AH.", "NTA. She sounds awful. A friend of mine didn\u2019t eat at my wedding because while we took allergies into account she had too many to eat anything safely. She ate before the wedding and was fine. At a recent get together she brought her own food and I was happy she did because I didn\u2019t want her to be hungry or get sick. She\u2019s used to it and accepts it and doesn\u2019t want to get sick either. \n\nThe bride wants everything to fit her vision and that doesn\u2019t include people not eating what she wants. Also pizza at a wedding isn\u2019t exactly high-class and she\u2019s getting upset over it. It\u2019s weird. \n\nEat before hand and be safe. I hope you can bring an Epi pen if she tries something underhanded.", "ESH\n\nYour cousin for yelling and being the bully she always was.\n\nYou for (1) expecting any different, (2) calling to announce you're not eating.\n\nWhy would you tell her? There'll be ton of people there, she wouldn't have noticed. You could have even gotten a slice and just not eaten it.  By calling, I am sure you made your cousin fear that other people would think the pizza is bad (since you don't exactly walk around with a \"*Hello, I'm Severely Allergic to Dairy*\" name tag on). To make a special call about it was.... unwise, given the audience.\n\nIn any case, I'm not sure going to the wedding of your bully, where your apparently toxic mom will be, is the best environment for a \"Meet the Parents\". If it's stressful NOW, I can only imagine what it will be like in real life.", "ESH. If you don't want to eat the food served at a wedding, just show up and don't eat.\n\nYou didn't tell her you wouldn't be eating in order to \"help her save money.\" You told her as a passive aggressive means of protest against her choice of food served. \n\nShe sucks for bullying you and calling you fat and screaming at you over this instead of just ignoring your message or saying \"OK, don't eat\" or making an effort to accommodate your allergy.\n\nI have no idea why you're even going to this wedding.  You guys don't like each other.", "NTA but it seems unnecessary to say you would not be eating 2-6 pieces of pizza or some vegetables from a shared veggie tray. If it was individual plated meals it would be more important to say you would not be needing a meal.\n\nJust don\u2019t go. You were only using the wedding to introduce your SO to people. You can do that another way.", "Okay, hear me out.  YTA\n\nWhy did you even send the message in the first place?  You could just go to the wedding and not eat anything.  Bring a fucking granola bar.  Its not like the bride is watching the plates or who goes to the buffet.\n\nI kind of feel like sending that message AT ALL is what started the conflict and it wasn't necessary to send.  THEN, when she calls you back you give her one of the most gas lighting conversations I've heard in a long time (seriously, \"sounds like your having a bad day\", come on, thats fucked) and then you HANG UP ON HER?!?!\n\nThe more I think about it, the more i think YTA.  Lets consider the other side for a second.\n\nIts easy to judge a bride and criticize their decisions, but I think some understanding would be warranted here.  I am sure she has a TON of shit to figure out, and your just adding to her bullshit.  There are probably 15 other guests messaging her with bullshit about their various bullshit things and she has to find ways to navigate it all.  Im sure its hard.\n\nYou didn't NEED to be one of those people.  You could have just gone to the wedding and did your thing, ate a granola bar and shut the fuck up.  But you didn't.
