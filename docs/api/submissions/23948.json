She should have either purchased her tickets sooner when there was still a decent selection or chosen to go to a different showing. I get it. Purchasing exact seats for a movie is still a pretty new thing. That first come, first served mindset is hard to break. Nevertheless, her failure to plan ahead or react properly on finding there were no seats together left was not your problem.", "NTA. The woman purchased the two tickets far apart. It was her decision, and it was a bad one, as her child is too small to send off to sit by herself. So her solution was to usurp somebody else's seats and play the victim when the somebody else (you) objected, and retaliate for you saying no by making you look and feel bad. She could have simply purchased two seats together for a later show or a later date -- but instead she relied either on the kindness of strangers or on her own ability to manipulate the situation in her favor. None of this says anything bad about you, and it's all on her. I'm sorry her manipulativeness worked on your girlfriend.", "NTA. You had every right to those seats. The woman bought two seats that were really far apart (one in the front, and one in the back), expecting someone to swap with her--what was she thinking/expecting...?! She knew she would be separating another family/couple to accommodate her and her daughter. Regardless, she brought a young child to the theater, and it was nice of someone to swap with her to just make it work, but that was going above and beyond. Sometimes people have to learn lessons, too. Don't get me wrong, you can and should always do acts of kindness if and when you feel inclined to.

It's all on the mother. She could have waited until another time when there would be more availability for the seating arrangements she wanted.

If it did not work out the time and day she chose, that is on her.  All seats are prepaid now.  For my granddaughter and I, good seats were not available when I first looked. So I looked at different dates and then found a different theater a short distance away on the same date and time I wanted.  This woman chose the first seats she saw that they could sit together.  They just happened to be yours.", "NTA", "YTA. Barbie???", "So much going on here.\n\n1. If your girlfriend felt that giving up seats was the right thing to do, she should've said so in the moment. I'm *reasonably* certain that her decision not to do so is *her* problem, but if it's possible that you tend to steamroll over her, you need to stop doing that.\n\n2. This is not an appropriate movie for 5 year olds.\n\n3. However, the desire of a woman to sit with her under-10 child trumps your desire to sit with your girlfriend. And while it's easy enough to say \"If you couldn't get seats together, Mom, you should've told your kid you'd come back on another day\" it's sometimes not so easy to *do* in practice.\n\nI'm giving you a light YTA. This is a situation where it's reasonable for the people sitting together to want to sit together, and, importantly, your girlfriend disagrees with you. And if your girlfriend wanted to sit apart and let them sit together, then that's that. Don't argue with her over something so relatively trivial. She should've said so right then and there, she failed to do so, next time ask her before responding for both of you.", "Nta. You planned ahead and she didn\u2019t.

Yes you could have switched and yes she could have been more responsible. And if your gf really cared she would have spoken up when it was happening.", ">I was being a bit inconsiderate.\n\nHow? You didn't force her to go to the movie or wait until the last minute to buy tickets. When she saw there were no more seats together, choose another time to go. The kid was probably bored anyway. NTA.", "No you were 100% correct. In fact you were too polite I would've simply told her get the hell out of my seat. The lady was rude she was the asshole as she knew the seats that she bought we're not together and she wanted to guilt somebody else.", "So she sat in the seats she wanted and booked two bad seats far apart from each other so both of you would have had to move. \n\nNope NTA. It\u2019s very easy to book ahead of time now and if it\u2019s completely sold out  or the only seats won\u2019t work for you, you just have see it another time.", "NTA lmao that woman is insanely entitled. I dont understand how people are calling her stupid and saying its \"poor planning\". There was nothing accidental about this, how can you guys not see that? The entire thing was a plan from the start. She knowingly bought seats nowhere near each other in a sold out event and then showed up hoping to still sit together anyway, theres no universe where that's not insanely entitled behavior. she really thought she could ask another group to split up in order to let her group be together instead, because apparently shes just so important. She even sat in seats that she obviously knew weren't hers, she didnt even wait to ask nicely. What a disgusting person she is. your gf is naive. And in the end the woman got nice seats in a sold out event so I say she had good planning.", "No!  This is ridiculous!  There are other showtimes, and if they don't work, I guess you don't see the movie.  Look, my husband is VERY particular about seats.  Even if I have taken the afternoon off and the seats aren't right...well, guess I am in the craft room cuz we ain't going.  This was incredibly irresponsible and entitled of the mother to do such a thing.  \n\nI am glad for \"Barbie\"'s success but this was not a GD emergency.", "Why was a 5 year old even at the Barbie movie? It\u2019s not that kind of Barbie, it\u2019s PG 13\n\nNTA regardless though", "NTA. that was HER problem; not yours. I hate when people do that crap... they need to plan better.", "And then the woman had the entitlement to choose prime seating to steal.", "NTA her poor planning doesn\u2019t constitute an emergency for you.", "NTA-Every time I see a post about a parent wanting to swap a seat that would mainly benefit the parent and child it makes me wonder.  Did they ask the person in the worse area if they would swap the child for a better seat?\n\nIn this case the mom and daughter go to the other seats and see if an individual would rather move to the middle seats.  It always seems they only want the better seats or they are the victim.", "This woman actually planned well - booked late, got terrible seats, planted her arse in the best seats in the theatre and then pretended she\u2019s the person who\u2019s being treated poorly when OP refuses to play her game. I bet she does this all the time and usually gets away with it. In fact, she got away with it this time because some other person fell for her sob story.

Some would say that\u2019s likely inappropriate for a 5 year old", "Same energy as the parents who took their kids to Sausage Party because it's animated so \"obviously it's a kid's movie\"", "I was thinking the same\n\nAnd she should have made the offer to a single person in the front seat because a back seat is not a bad seat for a movie. You can seen the screen fine \n\nIt is front seats which are awful because of the angle you are viewing and because you are so close that you can't really see the whole screen because of how most people's vision actually works.", "So you don't comment to each other during the previews? Share a ridiculously overpriced soda or popcorn? Sorry, but mom can find another time to attend the movie with her little princess.", "I didn\u2019t argue with her about it. After the movie she just mentioned that she felt bad for woman and thought I should\u2019ve gave her our seats. That was it, there was no argument or back and forth.", "Then it's extra important for mommy to make her arrangements ahead of time, isn't it? And while she's at it, maybe check the reviews to see if the  movie is something appropriate for her 5 year old??", "Dang, sucks for them.", "A Grandma and her under 10 year old granddaughter were sitting a couple empty seats over and she loudly asked what\u2019s a gynecologist and me and my roommate cracked up so much we missed the answer.", "NTA.\n\nWhy do some folks think they can freely take what others paid for?", "NTA. She didn\u2019t plan well for the movies and should have rescheduled.", "NTA \n\nThe woman is an entitled parent. She should have booked a different day if the seats weren't available.\n\nAlso isn't the movie for adults? What's a 6 year old doing there?", "Definitely NTA\n\nThe woman bought her seats late assuming that she could guilt someone into taking her FAR WORSE seats.  People like her are why people like me are automatically suspicious of parents asking for special treatment.", "nta. she knew when she bought the tickets they weren\u2019t together but bought them anyway hoping someone would feel bad enough to swap. you\u2019re not wrong for saying no at all that isn\u2019t your responsibility it\u2019s her fault", "NTA. So, when she saw there weren\u2019t seats together, instead of booking another showing like a normal person, she thought it was okay to book two of the worst seats in the place and then occupy two of the best seats and expect total strangers to give them up \u2018just cos\u2019? Separating other people who had come together? \n\nThere are three assholes here - this ridiculous entitled woman, and whichever idiots swapped with her and her daughter. People who pull this trick should be left standing in the aisle.", "NTA\n\nThere's always another showing. I doubt this was the only one they could go to. If it was, she should have bought the tickets much earlier.", "NTA. That woman did that on purpose banking on some stranger being gracious enough to enable her bad decisions so she would be able to sit next to her kid. \n\nAny decent mother would get tickets that guaranteed she would be sitting next to her daughter, as is her responsibility in keeping her offspring safe and supervised. \n\nYou\u2019re not an asshole for not playing her game.", "NTA. I don't understand why your gf shouldn't feel bad either. It's a movie, she could of picked a different showing. I also don't like that other people decided to give up their seats for them either. It just gives the entitled mom justification for her terrible planning.", "Yeah her making Op feel bad for not inconveniencing himself to accommodate her bad choice is inappropriate and manipulative. I get why he feels bad, I would too, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s his fault or that he\u2019s obligated to give up his seat.", "So how come the theater let her enter?", "Haha why is the nuclear option always the first option?", "I always feel bad when someone clearly in the wrong plays the victim and craps all over me.", "Sometimes people have to travel last minute with kids ( funeral for example or other medical emergency) and in that case in a plane it train it would be more understandable. A movie is not a necessity at all.", "It would have been kind of you to trade the seats.", "NTA. The mother made a gamble and lost (at least when it came to your seat). I can't blame her, sometimes it's worth a shot but if you lose you lose. I don't know what tone or language you used when refusing her but I'll be optimistic and say nta.", "NTA. Same thing happened for my group of 4. We got there right after the lights went low. We\u2019re very obviously checking the seats at the end of a row because people were sitting in them. We just went to get someone to make them move. One of the girls in our seat was all pouty about it and said \u201cwell they are sitting in our seat \ud83d\ude25\u201d about someone else. Next thing, the usher has gone across the theater checking seats and making 5 different groups move. All because one group of assholes had to sit separately and just took other people\u2019s seats. Not my fault, not my problem, not me being an asshole and neither were you.", "Definitely NTA. You booked and paid for those seats. The woman should have planned her outing better.

You planned and chose those seats well before the move. She chose to do it spontaneously, and instead of saying \u201coh well, we\u2019ll see it some other time\u201d she got the tickets and assumed that someone else would move. Why she sat down in a seat not even close to either one of their own is beyond me.\n\nI worked in a movie theatre and when selling tickets I saw this all the time. People saying \u201coh well, we can just ask someone to move!\u201d I would always say that I wouldn\u2019t recommend it, because they planned and bought the tickets in time because they wanted those tickets. \n\nIt feel like it\u2019s very rude to just assume someone else would fix your bad planning\u2026", "You know that phrase \"every man for himself\"?  \n\nWhat you did was exemplify that ideology.  \n\nYou said \"I told her that wasn\u2019t my problem\" but you knew she knew that, right?  \n\nShe wasn't asking you to fix a problem *you* caused - she asked you to help her with a problem *she* had.  \n\nSo yes, you were rude to her. You were condescending and, it sounds like, also suggesting she was wrong for even asking such a thing.   \n\nNow, as everyone else here is saying, you certainly don't have any *responsibility* to help anyone, certainly not with something as trivial as seats in a movie theater.  \n\nBut you aren't necessarily an asshole for avoiding responsibility, and you aren't necessarily not an asshole for ignoring something that isn't your responsibility. \n\nEvery man for himself is a totally practical ideology - you do your thing, and in do mine, and if I die while you have food, well, that's on me for not having more food.  \n\nBut there's other ideologies out there, and they *dont* all require you to tell a woman and her 5 year old that you don't care that *they* have a problem, and that they should just leave.  Some of them would even suggest that, especially if it didn't really put you out much, that you do let a woman and her 5 year old sit together, since otherwise that little girl wasn't going to see the Barbie movie. \n\nYou could have helped them out, and it would have made that little girls day, and taken a huge load of that ladies problems, and all it would have cost you was not sitting with your girlfriend during the movie.  \n\nSo, no, you weren't an asshole, and you didn't ignore any social obligations, but you also didn't do the kind thing - the nice thing - when you easily could have.  \n\nThe framing of the posts to this website force us into seemingly only being able to vindicate you or castigate you, but in this case, while you certainly didn't do the wrong thing, you didn't do the right thing either.", "NTA come on, we have been through this.

Like if you are going to try this maneuver, at least look for equal seats to yours. Like sit in your seat and the one next to it, not in 2 random seats of prime real estate.
