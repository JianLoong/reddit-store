You were not required to switch seats.  Not sure I'd want to if I went to a movie with my SO as I'd want to watch with them.", "NTA. She should have planned better.", "NTA. You paid for your seats. The mother knew that there weren't available seats together when she paid for her tickets. Instead of expecting someone else to accommodate her, she should have waited for a different show, or accommodated her child on her lap for the duration, or waited until the theater filled to see if another spot with 2 adjacent seats became available, or requested politely that someone else move over if possible.", "NTA.

You ask the person on either side of the seats you bought.", "NTA the woman should have chose a different movie time instead of assuming people would move for her.

Probably won\u2019t be the last time she will expect a stranger to be inconvenienced for her because of her poor planning.", "NTA. \n\nI am a parent. If I can\u2019t find seats together, I don\u2019t buy the tickets. This applies to plane tickets, movie tickets, live theater tickets. \n\nHer lack of planning should not be your problem.", "NTA but I'm just scratching my head at two grown ass adults going to the Barbie movie", "This wasn\u2019t an airplane seat. The mother and daughter could go to the movie some other, less busy day, or to a later screening, or actually pre plan and buy tickets ahead of time.\n\n It\u2019s not like the Barbie movie is going anywhere. NTA", "NTA. Do you know what I do if I can't get seats together for a show? I check a different showing! Especially with a movie, when you have at least a few weeks and multiple options a day to see it. \n\nAside from that I wouldn't send my little one off to sit away from me any time soon.", "NTA. She asked, you said no politely.", "Parent here, NTA. They could get a refund or have prepared better.", "NTA she should have gone to a different showing time.", "NTA. That movie is PG13 and she shouldn't have brought in a kid that young. Plus her lack of planning is not your problem to solve", "NTA\n\nYou paid for those tickets, so you get to sit in them. She could have always seen it in a non-busy day and got neighbouring seats then.", "NTA. She should\u2019ve bought tickets for another screening where she could get seats next to each other. Without having to bully other people into switching seats because she didn\u2019t plan ahead.", "NTA she is being entitled she new those seats were paid for and decided to sit their anyway. While yes it\u2019s nice to do something for people like that occasionally. However with seats being assigned now she shouldn\u2019t be doing that. She should buy ahead so her and her daughter can sit together.", "Nta", "NTA\n\nAn interesting variant on the eternal airplane seating posts!   Similar answer - you paid for those seats, precisely those seats, and she can go pound sand.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(Edit: typo)", "NTA. She should have either purchased her tickets sooner when there was still a decent selection or chosen to go to a different showing. I get it. Purchasing exact seats for a movie is still a pretty new thing. That first come, first served mindset is hard to break. Nevertheless, her failure to plan ahead or react properly on finding there were no seats together left was not your problem.", "NTA. The woman purchased the two tickets far apart. It was her decision, and it was a bad one, as her child is too small to send off to sit by herself. So her solution was to usurp somebody else's seats and play the victim when the somebody else (you) objected, and retaliate for you saying no by making you look and feel bad. She could have simply purchased two seats together for a later show or a later date -- but instead she relied either on the kindness of strangers or on her own ability to manipulate the situation in her favor. None of this says anything bad about you, and it's all on her. I'm sorry her manipulativeness worked on your girlfriend.", "NTA. You had every right to those seats. The woman bought two seats that were really far apart (one in the front, and one in the back), expecting someone to swap with her--what was she thinking/expecting...?! She knew she would be separating another family/couple to accommodate her and her daughter. Regardless, she brought a young child to the theater, and it was nice of someone to swap with her to just make it work, but that was going above and beyond. Sometimes people have to learn lessons, too. Don't get me wrong, you can and should always do acts of kindness if and when you feel inclined to. But you don't have an obligation in this case.", "NTA- I had a similar experience at Barbie where a teenage girl asked us to move so she could sit with her friends. Thing is, we are very particular about where we sit in the theater and refused. She ended up sitting on the floor beside her friend's couch. I think life lessons are important.", "NTA. It's all on the mother. She could have waited until another time when there would be more availability for the seating arrangements she wanted. She was fully aware of the seating chart when she bought the tickets - she should have done better. Good on you for standing up for yourself.", "Yes!\nThis applies to soo many situations...\n\n\"Poor planning on their part does not constitute an emergency on your part\""]}
