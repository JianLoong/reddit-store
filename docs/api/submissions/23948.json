Instead of expecting someone else to accommodate her, she should have waited for a different show, or accommodated her child on her lap for the duration, or waited until the theater filled to see if another spot with 2 adjacent seats became available, or requested politely that someone else move over if possible.", "NTA.

You ask the person on either side of the seats you bought.", "NTA the woman should have chose a different movie time instead of assuming people would move for her.

Probably won\u2019t be the last time she will expect a stranger to be inconvenienced for her because of her poor planning.", "NTA. \n\nI am a parent. If I can\u2019t find seats together, I don\u2019t buy the tickets. This applies to plane tickets, movie tickets, live theater tickets. \n\nHer lack of planning should not be your problem.", "NTA but I'm just scratching my head at two grown ass adults going to the Barbie movie", "This wasn\u2019t an airplane seat. The mother and daughter could go to the movie some other, less busy day, or to a later screening, or actually pre plan and buy tickets ahead of time.\n\n It\u2019s not like the Barbie movie is going anywhere. NTA", "NTA. Do you know what I do if I can't get seats together for a show? I check a different showing! Especially with a movie, when you have at least a few weeks and multiple options a day to see it. \n\nAside from that I wouldn't send my little one off to sit away from me any time soon.", "NTA. She asked, you said no politely.", "Parent here, NTA. They could get a refund or have prepared better.", "NTA she should have gone to a different showing time.", "NTA. That movie is PG13 and she shouldn't have brought in a kid that young. Plus her lack of planning is not your problem to solve", "NTA\n\nYou paid for those tickets, so you get to sit in them. She could have always seen it in a non-busy day and got neighbouring seats then.", "NTA. She should\u2019ve bought tickets for another screening where she could get seats next to each other. Without having to bully other people into switching seats because she didn\u2019t plan ahead.", "NTA she is being entitled she new those seats were paid for and decided to sit their anyway. While yes it\u2019s nice to do something for people like that occasionally. However with seats being assigned now she shouldn\u2019t be doing that. She should buy ahead so her and her daughter can sit together.", "Nta", "NTA\n\nAn interesting variant on the eternal airplane seating posts!   Similar answer - you paid for those seats, precisely those seats, and she can go pound sand.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(Edit: typo)", "NTA. She should have either purchased her tickets sooner when there was still a decent selection or chosen to go to a different showing. I get it. Purchasing exact seats for a movie is still a pretty new thing. That first come, first served mindset is hard to break. Nevertheless, her failure to plan ahead or react properly on finding there were no seats together left was not your problem.", "NTA. The woman purchased the two tickets far apart. It was her decision, and it was a bad one, as her child is too small to send off to sit by herself. So her solution was to usurp somebody else's seats and play the victim when the somebody else (you) objected, and retaliate for you saying no by making you look and feel bad. She could have simply purchased two seats together for a later show or a later date -- but instead she relied either on the kindness of strangers or on her own ability to manipulate the situation in her favor. None of this says anything bad about you, and it's all on her. I'm sorry her manipulativeness worked on your girlfriend.", "NTA. You had every right to those seats. The woman bought two seats that were really far apart (one in the front, and one in the back), expecting someone to swap with her--what was she thinking/expecting...?! She knew she would be separating another family/couple to accommodate her and her daughter. Regardless, she brought a young child to the theater, and it was nice of someone to swap with her to just make it work, but that was going above and beyond. Sometimes people have to learn lessons, too. Don't get me wrong, you can and should always do acts of kindness if and when you feel inclined to. But you don't have an obligation in this case.", "NTA- I had a similar experience at Barbie where a teenage girl asked us to move so she could sit with her friends. Thing is, we are very particular about where we sit in the theater and refused. She ended up sitting on the floor beside her friend's couch. I think life lessons are important.", "NTA. It's all on the mother. She could have waited until another time when there would be more availability for the seating arrangements she wanted. She was fully aware of the seating chart when she bought the tickets - she should have done better. Good on you for standing up for yourself.", "Yes!\nThis applies to soo many situations...\n\n\"Poor planning on their part does not constitute an emergency on your part\"", "She booked her seats knowing there were two left and they weren't together. sounds like a her problem.\n\nNTA", "NTA.. you also wanted watch the movie together", "NTA there are multiple showings of that movie, if she couldn't get 2 seats together she should have looked for another time. Just sitting in someone's seat and planning to not move is not a great plan.", "The only inconsiderate person here is a woman who chooses ASSIGNED SEATS far apart and then decides to sit somewhere else during the show. NTA and I honestly wish there was more to this story", "NTA as a mother myself no you should not feel bad. There are other shows and as a parent I would have picked a different one.", "NTA\u2026there is more than one showtime for the movie.  And more than one day.  If it did not work out the time and day she chose, that is on her.  All seats are prepaid now.  For my granddaughter and I, good seats were not available when I first looked. So I looked at different dates and then found a different theater a short distance away on the same date and time I wanted.  This woman chose the first seats she saw that they could sit together.  They just happened to be yours.", "NTA", "YTA. Barbie???", "So much going on here.\n\n1. If your girlfriend felt that giving up seats was the right thing to do, she should've said so in the moment. I'm *reasonably* certain that her decision not to do so is *her* problem, but if it's possible that you tend to steamroll over her, you need to stop doing that.\n\n2. This is not an appropriate movie for 5 year olds.\n\n3. However, the desire of a woman to sit with her under-10 child trumps your desire to sit with your girlfriend. And while it's easy enough to say \"If you couldn't get seats together, Mom, you should've told your kid you'd come back on another day\" it's sometimes not so easy to *do* in practice.\n\nI'm giving you a light YTA. This is a situation where it's reasonable for the people sitting together to want to sit together, and, importantly, your girlfriend disagrees with you. And if your girlfriend wanted to sit apart and let them sit together, then that's that. Don't argue with her over something so relatively trivial. She should've said so right then and there, she failed to do so, next time ask her before responding for both of you.", "Nta. You planned ahead and she didn\u2019t. No one forced her to buy tickets to a show without 2 together.", "NTA  and that woman should not have brought a 5yo to a PG13 movie", "Your girflriend is a doormat, dodge that bullet by dumping her now.", "When I bought Barbie tickets, there weren't any seats together at the showing I chose when I tried to buy them, so I...chose another showing.\n\nNTA. This woman's poor planning isn't your emergency.", "NTA. Mom knew it was assigned seating. Also most theaters here in the US have large, reclining seats now. She could have sat kiddo on her lap for the movie.", "Also, anyone whose seen the movie will tell you, the Barbie movie isn't aimed at younger children like the animated ones are. It's aimed at tweens/teens, and adults.", "She also decided she deserved two much better seats.", "I dont get it, why?", "No, if you've taken the time and effort to purchase the seats you want you're entitled to sit there guilt free. Mom knew the seats she bought were not together.  That's on her. She can see another showing. What's the point of going to the movies with your SO if you have to sit several rows apart?", "It was a date night activity. GF felt some guilt but nope they are NTA for using their tix. Sheesh", "How is it YTA when they could have bought tickets to a separate showing rather than expecting more responsible people to give up their seats?", "Its an adult movie. Did you just crawl out of a cave?", "The movie is decently adult", "A 5-6 year old is going to become bored as soon as the scene changes out of Barbieland and it's just adults talking. It is rated PG-13.", "Not the point though.  Plan in advance!", "As we sometimes say at work (to each other, not to the customer)\n\n\nThat sounds like a problem. It doesn't sound like MY problem", "Animated isn't always for young children. A lot of \"live action\" kids movies are great. I remeber watching cadet Kelly as a 6 year old. I can't say I fully understood it, but I enjoyed it. Enough that I remember watching it and what is is about over 2 decades later.\n\nNow the Barbie movie... I haven't seen it but what I heard it isn't for young kids. It is aimed for the older audience based on the jokes and innuendo, amd serious scenes I've heard about.", "My take is based on seeing it. The first part will be good for children who are into barbie because it features all the cool barbie gadgets (including a house and car that my daughter had 20 years ago). The part that's in LA is definitely for adults in terms of theme and  dialogue.\n\n (Not particularly unsuitable for children, just that they will be bored. And depending on how young the child is, be prepared to explain what \"vagina\" and \"gynecologist\" mean).\n\nYou should definitely check it out."]}
