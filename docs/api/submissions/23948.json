Similar answer - you paid for those seats, precisely those seats, and she can go pound sand.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(Edit: typo)", "NTA. She should have either purchased her tickets sooner when there was still a decent selection or chosen to go to a different showing. I get it. Purchasing exact seats for a movie is still a pretty new thing. That first come, first served mindset is hard to break. Nevertheless, her failure to plan ahead or react properly on finding there were no seats together left was not your problem.", "NTA. The woman purchased the two tickets far apart. It was her decision, and it was a bad one, as her child is too small to send off to sit by herself. So her solution was to usurp somebody else's seats and play the victim when the somebody else (you) objected, and retaliate for you saying no by making you look and feel bad. She could have simply purchased two seats together for a later show or a later date -- but instead she relied either on the kindness of strangers or on her own ability to manipulate the situation in her favor. None of this says anything bad about you, and it's all on her. I'm sorry her manipulativeness worked on your girlfriend.", "NTA. You had every right to those seats. The woman bought two seats that were really far apart (one in the front, and one in the back), expecting someone to swap with her--what was she thinking/expecting...?! She knew she would be separating another family/couple to accommodate her and her daughter. Regardless, she brought a young child to the theater, and it was nice of someone to swap with her to just make it work, but that was going above and beyond. Sometimes people have to learn lessons, too. Don't get me wrong, you can and should always do acts of kindness if and when you feel inclined to. But you don't have an obligation in this case.", "NTA- I had a similar experience at Barbie where a teenage girl asked us to move so she could sit with her friends.

It's all on the mother. She could have waited until another time when there would be more availability for the seating arrangements she wanted.

Good on you for standing up for yourself.", "Yes!\nThis applies to soo many situations...\n\n\"Poor planning on their part does not constitute an emergency on your part\"", "She booked her seats knowing there were two left and they weren't together. sounds like a her problem.\n\nNTA", "NTA.. you also wanted watch the movie together", "NTA there are multiple showings of that movie, if she couldn't get 2 seats together she should have looked for another time.

There are other shows and as a parent I would have picked a different one.", "NTA\u2026there is more than one showtime for the movie.  And more than one day.  If it did not work out the time and day she chose, that is on her.  All seats are prepaid now.  For my granddaughter and I, good seats were not available when I first looked. So I looked at different dates and then found a different theater a short distance away on the same date and time I wanted.  This woman chose the first seats she saw that they could sit together.  They just happened to be yours.", "NTA", "YTA. Barbie???", "So much going on here.\n\n1. If your girlfriend felt that giving up seats was the right thing to do, she should've said so in the moment. I'm *reasonably* certain that her decision not to do so is *her* problem, but if it's possible that you tend to steamroll over her, you need to stop doing that.\n\n2. This is not an appropriate movie for 5 year olds.\n\n3. However, the desire of a woman to sit with her under-10 child trumps your desire to sit with your girlfriend. And while it's easy enough to say \"If you couldn't get seats together, Mom, you should've told your kid you'd come back on another day\" it's sometimes not so easy to *do* in practice.\n\nI'm giving you a light YTA. This is a situation where it's reasonable for the people sitting together to want to sit together, and, importantly, your girlfriend disagrees with you. And if your girlfriend wanted to sit apart and let them sit together, then that's that. Don't argue with her over something so relatively trivial. She should've said so right then and there, she failed to do so, next time ask her before responding for both of you.", "Nta. You planned ahead and she didn\u2019t.
