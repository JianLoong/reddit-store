I hope you\u2019re getting some help with the post-natal depression.", "You don't seem at all appreciative that MIL ended up paying for the salad, just angry that she even asked you to. You also don't say why she asked you to pay. Did you go over budget? Were you rude to her, resulting in her not wanting to pay any more?\n\nIt is also completely normal to let family stay with you. My house is tiny and it is very cramped setting up air mattresses in the loungeroom and kitchen. But these are people I care about and they have gone out of their way to visit me. You seem to be extremely inflexible and take things very personally, probably as a result of your abusive mother. While they absolutely should have asked first, you also went nuclear. Why didn't they know you had post partum depression? Even if you don't want their support, your husband should be able to get support from his family while supporting you. \n\nFamily can be very annoying but the worst you have to say about these people in 10 years is you got into an argument with them over paying for salads and they turned up at your house once without calling first. I suspect all the comments you are percieving as undermining are actually just irritating attempts to be helpful. This actually happens in healthy families as well. The normal way to deal with it is just to tell them you know they mean well but stop commenting on your parenting unless you ask for help. You don't stew over it, believing the worst of them and plan to cut them off. \n\nFor your husbands sake, I would cease the hostilities with his family. He needs to talk to them firmly about not commenting on you parenting. He also should let them know you were post partum so they understand why you went nuclear over their visit. Therapy might be a good idea as well.", "So are you getting therapy?  Cutting people off is appropriate in some circumstances, but not all.  So if you are your own therapist, you may not be helping yourself.  \n\nNow I appreciate that having extra people unannounced and expecting to stay in a tiny home is inconvenient, but for one or two nights, it\u2019s inconvenient, not something you would kick people out of your home for, and it could have been managed better.  \n\nYou should have let them stay the night, and the next day, talk to them about next time and how with the limited space, and current stress from postpartum, that it really has to be something you all plan out in advance, or perhaps make an arrangement for a weekend to all stay at an Airbnb that can easily accommodate everyone.\n\nNot every answer is off with their heads.  You\u2019re conditioned to that reaction due to your mom.  But in this case it\u2019s just about setting some healthy boundaries.

I understand your frustration but you\u2019re not being an easy person either. Letting family stay at your place is normal no matter how much space they might take. It\u2019s not like they are staying a month, why is it such a problem to let them stay the night? From just what you are saying, you sound harsh and it\u2019s probably hard for your husband.

Did he agree and not tell you? That is definitely AH territory. He must be aware of your postnatal depression and really ought  to be able to understand what help and support you need. He needs to grow a backbone and tell his parents that that decision has been revisited and consequently negated pronto. There are cheap hotels around and they should avail themselves of them if they wish to see the family regularly. \n\nAs for going to theirs for Christmas,, it sounds terrible. As I said previously, husband needs to grow a spine and tell them that it is not possible for the family to visit them.

Just because you are senstized to bad behavior or are sensitive due to post partum doesn't mean that you're wrong about any of your MIL's behavior being not okay. \n\nHaving someone show up on your door step unexpected with zero notice is fine if they are just going to be there for an hour and don't add inconvenience. Showing up unexpectedly with plans to stay the night is never okay, no matter how close the family member. \n\nHaving someone give unsolicited advice is never fun and I'm sorry you're having to deal with that. People are telling you in the comments to just put up with it because of her intention, because your MIL just trying to be helpful. But they are apparently oblivious to the fact that there is a whole type of narcissistic personality disorder that is based on being helpful. \n\nThe advice I would give you is to pick your battles and find ways to talk yourself into believing the rest of the things she does don't bother you. Pretend your MIL is a narcissist and use her ego to manipulate her. Use compliments and thank yous to try to get her to take on tasks that would make your life easier. Let her watch the baby and go take a long nap. Tell her how grateful you are for that opportunity so that she feels positve about her good deed and wants to help again next time they visit. But next time they visit, have some other task lined up for her. Even just have her watch the baby so that you can take an extra long shower can be a little gift to yourself.\n\nBut here is the thing I advise with narcissists. Avoid patterns. They will thrive on the excitement of something new, so keep them on their toes. If you allow patterns to develop, that will give them opportunities to plan for next time. You want to get and stay in control. When your MIL crosses a line, have some responses ready to go. Unsolicited advice can receive a standard response every time of \"Thank you for your thoughts. I'll keep that in mind\". Repeat the same thing enough time and she'll eventually get the hint. If she REALLY crosses a line, try silence. Don't avoid her and don't say anything. Just continue doing what you were doing in the same room and let that uncomfortable silence do the speaking for you, letting her know that you're not saying anything because you can't say what you'd really like to say.\n\nI think you're overthinking Christmas. If you're feeling overwhelmed and don't feel up to it, then don't go. If you're excited for the holiday and would like to be around people, then go. But you have to stop dwelling on it. Decide that you're not going to decide until Christmas morning and you'll instantly get rid of all of the dread you're currenty feeling.", "NTA at all.

If I were you I would tell him the once a month stay at your home stops. They stay in a hotel and only when you both agree they can visit. And when they do visit, they don\u2019t get to just sit and hog the baby and expect to be fed and waited on. So they 1) have to wait to be invited. 2) stay at a hotel or travel down and back in same day. 3) Visit is limited to x hours or they are escorted out if they cross boundaries 4) he has one week to communicate this to his parents and it\u2019s presented as OUR decision - he can\u2019t blame it on you even though his parents will still say that 5) if he doesn\u2019t follow through you will and you will be blunt 6) couples\u2019 counseling so he can be shown the light that he\u2019s a doormat to his parents and you\u2019re DONE with it.", "NTA.\n\nYou have a husband problem.

I don\u2019t know too many mothers that didn\u2019t go through this and it wouldn\u2019t be a stretch to even assume MIL may have experienced this as well.

I had ordered months prior to wedding sweet potato fries, BBQ burgers, vegan and meat choice with plenty of cake, as it was a barn wedding. MiL found out 5 days before the wedding and literally (not exaggerating) threw a fit because \"that's not a nutritional meal\" and demanded something additional. I said I couldn't afford it so she offered to pay whatever the cost and I had to quickly order extra which in the end cost \u00a3650, it rattled me because it was so last minute and I thought food was sorted, I had moved onto other things that ended sorting. But like I say, once it was sorted that was it, I didn't think her behaviour would occur again.\n\nI do agree in that my mother has affected me for the rest of my life, and I have gone to therapy with her and on my own before I made the decision to cut her out, this is not something I want to do and not something I've hinted at doing with my husband. \nRE: post partum issue. My MiL attitude to mental health issues is \"don't be so sensitive, you just have to pick yourself back up again and carry on. Others have it worse than you \" words that were said to my husband when he went through depression some years back. I don't think she would understand the depression tbh, there have been things she's judged me on, for eg. Breastfeeding. I do combi feeding and she got really upset because I don't exclusively breastfeed, which has a personal and medical reason. Even when I told her this, she still didn't understand and doesn't see how the baby cannot latch like her three boys did (she exclusively breastfeed for a year per child).\n\nI feel like Ive tried really hard with her, and I am going to be having some more therapy with an actual psychiatrist due to the PPD rather than a general counsellor, so hopefully I'll be able to create some coping mechanisms. Talking with my MiL doesn't seem to have helped any in the past, suggestions to go for a girly coffee have been refused and she hasn't shown interest in spending time with me until the baby arrived, which is great she wants to be part of her life but I do feel I need to be on better terms with her, and somehow get her to respect me as she tends to treat me like a child.

I'll try it a few different ways though, maybe be more direct as I may have said it as a request, but I like your idea. \n\nI'm trying to not overthink Xmas, I'm a natural people pleaser so I hate letting people down and I let my anxiety get the better of me.

She isn't empathetic at all and has never understood mental issues, so I feel that her knowing about my issues might even give her ammo to tell me what to do as a mother and in general. Her attitude is 'suck it up buttercup', which I've never felt was helpful. I've never snapped at her before and she's known me for 10 years, I'd like to think she should know that I'm not like this usually but all she could see was accusing me of not wanting to let her see the baby.\n\nWhen it's just my husband, baby and even close friends around, all is well.

I only had to do this due to child abuse that my mother refused to acknowledge and she continued to be emotionally abusive as I grew up and I couldn't cope.", "Thanks for this, I have been on depression and anxiety meds for over a month now", "Yes!", "It isn't going nuclear to tell someone they can't stay the night without warning, especially when they're just springing it on new parents. You don't just decide one day that you're going to sleep over and someone's house without even asking them. It is absolutely okay to say, \"Hey, my house is way too small and I don't feel comfortable with you staying the night.\" Just because you let people stay in your small place, doesn't mean anyone else has to feel obligated to do so.\n\nOP's medical history is also no one else's business. If they don't feel comfortable disclosing they have ppd, that's their business. Yes, the husband might need support, too. But he can ask for support without disclosing said info. Something as simple as, \"Things are hard right now while we're adjusting.\" Also, the husband needing support doesn't require his parents to stay over when his wife, who is having these difficulties, isn't comfortable with it. \n\nThese are completely reasonable boundaries, OP. These are all things you need to discuss with your partner so you have the support setting your boundaries. These are his parents, so he should be standing up to them for you or at least supporting your decisions. My MIL is horrible and we are incredibly low contact because of it. She knows that I won't respond to her and nearly all contact, unless it's an emergency, should be done with my partner. Whenever she decides not to adhere to these, my partner immediately steps in. You should have that support, too. Of course, I understand if he WANTS them there, but it needs to be a discussion, not something one or the other decides unilaterally.", "I understand about your mother, she sounds alot like what I went through with my father. Please trust me, she will be out of your head eventually, a good therapist is a must. I was blessed with an awesome one. I couldn't have made it without her. In the meantime, your experiences with her will, unfortunately, colour many of your interactions with others. This is where your husband needs to run interference for you. HE needs to deal with hi parents, not you, and he needs to grow a pair on your behalf. TELL HIM TO GROW UP."]}
