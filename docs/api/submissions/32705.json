However, my in laws have been frustrating, to say the least. Backstory on me: I cut my biological mother off in 2021 because she was a narcissist and I realised she had been super abusive to me growing up. So I had enough when she started to try to control me when I got married and since, the stress in my life has lifted so much without her in my life. \n\nThat was until my new MiL decided (in my opinion) to be a dick. There were red flags initially such as: demanding me to suddenly pay for \u00a3650 worth of salad and coleslaw for our wedding 5 days prior to the wedding - she ended up paying for it because I couldn't afford it, so that was that. Since we have had a baby, the dick metre has flown up into the red and my FiL just goes with it. \n\nLast month they visited and unbeknownst to my husband and I they had decided to camp on the floor in our tiny dining room for the night, which I said no to. We have a tiny end terrace 2 bed house, perfect for hubby, me and baby but not 2 additional adults taking up bathroom time and downstairs space. British Victorian houses are not big, to say the least. So I said no, and they both kicked off accusing me that I didn't want them to see their grandchild, which really upset me because it's untrue. \n\nAlso, they don't know it, but I am suffering from postnatal depression, so I did lose my shit at them telling them they were being selfish for expecting us to take them in without even telling us first. My husband just didn't genuinely didn't know what to do. The row ended up with me taking the baby upstairs as I realised she was getting upset and hubby defused the situation by allowing them to stay against what I wanted. My husband had agreed with them to allow them to stay 1 night a month to see our baby as they don't want to shell out to stay in a cheap hotel and they think travelling down for the day is not worth it (they live 2.5 hours away). \n\nAnyways, since then my MiL has kept making small digs which really upsets me, like \"don't force feed her\" and undermining me.

I\u2019m NO way should they spend the night at your home when you said no. If they don\u2019t want to drive 2.5 hours each way and stay in a hotel then don\u2019t come plain and simple.", "I don't know what it is about MILs and throwing around their ideas like it is their way or the highway. \n\nIf the child is fed, clothed, has a roof over their head and they are safe... be quiet!!! They had their chance with their kids... many of the times we are saying \"when I have children I would never do what my mum/dad did *insert issue*\"\nAnyways... NTA can you just stay home and say you really aren't feeling well and send your husband... then after Christmas bring up the issue properly. \n\nGet your husband to raise the issue in your defence. Not like a feel sorry for you thing, but as a Mil is out of line thing. If you want to go next level... say your mother is no longer involved because you are no longer dealing with toxic people. \n\nIf you don't hear it enough. Your doing great!! Dont let them get to you.", ">My husband had agreed with them to allow them to stay 1 night a month to see our baby\n\nINFO: Your husband made that agreement *prior* to the visit you're complaining about?", "I wouldn\u2019t say You\u2019re TA, but staying one night a month to spend time with their grandchild is not really a big ask, especially if they\u2019re willing to sleep on the dining room floor. I hope you\u2019re getting some help with the post-natal depression.", "You don't seem at all appreciative that MIL ended up paying for the salad, just angry that she even asked you to. You also don't say why she asked you to pay. Did you go over budget? Were you rude to her, resulting in her not wanting to pay any more?\n\nIt is also completely normal to let family stay with you. My house is tiny and it is very cramped setting up air mattresses in the loungeroom and kitchen. But these are people I care about and they have gone out of their way to visit me. You seem to be extremely inflexible and take things very personally, probably as a result of your abusive mother. While they absolutely should have asked first, you also went nuclear. Why didn't they know you had post partum depression? Even if you don't want their support, your husband should be able to get support from his family while supporting you. \n\nFamily can be very annoying but the worst you have to say about these people in 10 years is you got into an argument with them over paying for salads and they turned up at your house once without calling first. I suspect all the comments you are percieving as undermining are actually just irritating attempts to be helpful. This actually happens in healthy families as well. The normal way to deal with it is just to tell them you know they mean well but stop commenting on your parenting unless you ask for help. You don't stew over it, believing the worst of them and plan to cut them off. \n\nFor your husbands sake, I would cease the hostilities with his family. He needs to talk to them firmly about not commenting on you parenting. He also should let them know you were post partum so they understand why you went nuclear over their visit. Therapy might be a good idea as well.", "So are you getting therapy?  Cutting people off is appropriate in some circumstances, but not all.  So if you are your own therapist, you may not be helping yourself.  \n\nNow I appreciate that having extra people unannounced and expecting to stay in a tiny home is inconvenient, but for one or two nights, it\u2019s inconvenient, not something you would kick people out of your home for, and it could have been managed better.  \n\nYou should have let them stay the night, and the next day, talk to them about next time and how with the limited space, and current stress from postpartum, that it really has to be something you all plan out in advance, or perhaps make an arrangement for a weekend to all stay at an Airbnb that can easily accommodate everyone.\n\nNot every answer is off with their heads.  You\u2019re conditioned to that reaction due to your mom.  But in this case it\u2019s just about setting some healthy boundaries.  Get some therapy, it will help you with techniques to better support your needs and setting healthy boundaries without alienating everyone who crosses you.", "You might be.. I understand your frustration but you\u2019re not being an easy person either. Letting family stay at your place is normal no matter how much space they might take. It\u2019s not like they are staying a month, why is it such a problem to let them stay the night? From just what you are saying, you sound harsh and it\u2019s probably hard for your husband. However, you wanting to avoid conflict with his parents is understandable and not wanting to go for Christmas is understandable as well.", "What you have to do is to tell your husband that you've PPD and he needs to grow a spine and work for his family instead of making his wife sick out of his lack of courage to face his parents. It's either  he grows it by himself or he goes to therapy.", "How many people do you plan to isolate and cut out of your life if they don\u2019t meet your expectations.", "Well, you are NTA but I'm having doubts about your husband and certainly about your in-laws.\n\nYour husband needed to have been upfront with you about agreeing for his parents to stay overnight. Did he agree and not tell you? That is definitely AH territory. He must be aware of your postnatal depression and really ought  to be able to understand what help and support you need. He needs to grow a backbone and tell his parents that that decision has been revisited and consequently negated pronto. There are cheap hotels around and they should avail themselves of them if they wish to see the family regularly. \n\nAs for going to theirs for Christmas,, it sounds terrible. As I said previously, husband needs to grow a spine and tell them that it is not possible for the family to visit them. Also given the way your MIL makes all these digs at you about childcare and so on, how confident are you about her attitude to the baby if you let your husband take her for the event?", "NTA because your not but.....  You need to sit down with the husband (and maybe a counselor) and agree to a set of boundaries you both will enforce for the in laws.   Don't just get a \"ya I'll do that\" from him, this has to be a back and forth discussion and he has to buy in to what you agree to. Otherwise this is just going to continue or escalate and you don't need to deal with that ever.", "NTA. Tell hubby go with the baby or stay home, those are his 2 choices. When they come for their sleepovers, go to your room just you or you and baby, husband invited them he can host them.", "NTA. Don't go and don't let him tske the baby either.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

Sometimes they have good advice, some is outdated, and some just doesn\u2019t jive with how you want to approach parenting.  You don\u2019t have to take anyone\u2019s advice.  But remember the origin of their advice, most often it\u2019s because they want to help, after all, they successfully raised your spouse and spouse\u2019s siblings.  They are to a degree, reliving their own experiences as a new parent and trying to help, where they may have likely had a struggle.  They love you, your kid and your spouse.  So for the bigger unsolicited advice you get, a simple, \u201cI appreciate the advice, but we have decided to do things this way.\u201d  For the small stuff, just ignore it.", "Yes, 5 hours spent traveling in one day is unreasonable, imo, if they are willing to sleep on the floor just to see their grandchild.  How would she feel if they decided that the travel was too much of a burden, and didn't bother to see the the baby at all?  I think she should be grateful they care that much."]}
