It also shows that sometimes when you give someone an inch, they take a mile. You and your sister showed so much maturity and grace by trying not to judge your step mom by the person she was then and instead focus on who she is now.

If she is infertile then they for sure just used your mom to have kids and then when they got what they wanted dumped her.", "Honestly, as much as I know she probably was very good to you and your sister. Your dad and stepmom are not the people you thought they were. She views your mom as an incubator for her and your dad to have a family. What she did was flat out psychotic. Like I\u2019m actually disturbed by her social media post. It\u2019s as if your non didn\u2019t exist. She\u2019s creepy and weird for that. That\u2019s not something a loving parent would say. She planned and plotted to steal your moms life. \n\nYou\u2019re not her first baby. You\u2019re not her baby period. \n\nNTA. \n\nYou have a really good mom. She put you and your sister first. I\u2019m glad you two get to share this special time together. Congrats on the wedding!", "I would've commented on her post\n\nThat's a really weird thing to say about your \"best friends\" daughter\n\nBut then again I'm a petty asshole", "My ex's affair partner told me outright she wanted my life.  Was funny when I didn't fight for him and she still didn't have my life, not realizing that I was the reason we had a great life.  It's not uncommon to want to take over completely.Someone sees someone who has the white picket fence SAHM lifestyle with nice things, and just wants to take you out and pop in your place.", "That is truly creepy on an insane level. NTA, but stay as far away from her (and maybe your dad) as possible. Seriously, your dad should be freaked out by this. He was a target for her.", "Honestly, just for that post, I\u2019d bar her from the wedding entirely. That post shows her true colors, her possessiveness, narcissism, and complete disregard for anyone else\u2019s feelings. Who knows how she\u2019ll react when she sees your mother giving the mother of the bride speech?  \n\nI know you\u2019ve seen her as a good mother, but as others have noted, narcissists are lovely people when they desire your affections, and not so much when things don\u2019t go their way. I\u2019m sure this is incredibly painful, but you gotta protect yourself from this vile woman. \n\nAlso, NTA.", "Also sounds like she also planned to not only steal your moms husband but her children also.", "Don't invite her to the wedding and tell her she should get over it in 20 years.", "Maybe she did! Did they wind up having kids together?", "I read a manga series.  Not likely to be your situation.  The kid didnt know the step mother was really the bio mother and the bio mother was the step mother. \n\nBut there were two couples.  One got pregnant and due to reasons break up and the two couple switch partners.  So the father and step mother raised the child like the step mother was her bio child.  Then later on the original father and mother reconcile and they get back together.  The bio mother becomes the step mother in this case.  Took awhile for the child to realize the step mother she thought she had was really her bio mother and her original bio mother was really her step mother", "Yeah. I find it weird she's in a profession for marriage and wants to attend when she clearly doesnt respect the institution or vows of marriage by having am affair with a married man.", "Begone bot!", "That's what I thought and even mentioned in another comment. Their mother was just an incubator for whatever creepy plan they had. I mean it's clear they were fucking for I guess forever. \n\nI know OP thinks she's a good person but honestly I think she's a deeply sociapathic, manipulative, evil person. They're really good at playing nice but oh boy when their true personality reveals... It's truly disgusting and terrifying. \n\nI can't believe the fucking audacity of that mistress and disgrace in name of woman.", "Blessed be the fruit \n\n\ud83e\udd22", "She wants to stick it her mom and showboat on social media what a great mom she is to \u201cher\u201d kids. She\u2019s not stepmom, just mom. She relishes in the fact she was the other woman, and won the love and hearts of her best friends kids. I\u2019m sure they did a lot of underhanded things over the years under the guise of a mothers love.", "I was thinking OP could respond something like \u201cthanks, but my Mom and I have everything under control.\u201d I do like your suggestion about relegating her back to \u201cMom\u2019s friend\u201d instead of \u201cstepmother\u201d. \n\nI suppose you could ask her if she thinks a subtle Cinderella theme might be fun for a wedding. Of course that supposes she catches the evil stepmother angle in that idea.", "This is the comment I was looking for!  That bogus, nauseating, post (and poster) NEEDS to be called out!!!  Wish I had an award for you!!!", "What did it say?", "This is the type of stepparent I fear tbh. The kind who feels like they are the true parent, and push their own narrative. Like the post truly sounds as if she\u2019s the one who gave birth to OP! It\u2019s so cringy and creepy. \n\nShe feels entitled to OP and every part of her life. Bio mom is simply that. The birth giver. Her and OPs dad clearly view themselves as the true parents. Her mom is just, idk. Along from the ride? They\u2019re talking about her like she was a surrogate, or worse. A handmaid. \n\nBlehhh this is the shit that gives stepparents a bad name. You are not entitled to someone else\u2019s child.", "NTA. You are the bride and you get to decide whose help you want in planning your wedding."]}
