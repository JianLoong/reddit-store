She was the other woman in my parents marriage and she was also supposed to be my mom's best friend. I didn't know her very well pre-affair reveal. She lived in another city and apparently most of my life and all of my sister's life she and our dad had been sleeping together. This is not something I was aware of as a kid. My sister and I knew we didn't have parents who got along after the divorce, we could sense the tension, once or twice we had an idea mom hated our stepmom, but she never said or did anything directly in front of us. The vibe was just there. It did not stop us loving our stepmom.\n\nWe found out what happened when we were 17 and 19. We felt so bad for our mom but our stepmom had always been good to us, and dad was good to us, so we tried not to let it change things.\n\nAfter my fiance and I announced our engagement on social media my stepmom wrote a post about how she dreamed of this day when I was born, how she had been so excited to watch her very first baby grow up and get married, how she and dad had talked about it before I could walk. She tagged my dad, but she also tagged some friends who knew her back then who were also friends with my mom. The post was distasteful and honestly was exposing that she had always planned to have the affair. It did change how I felt. I told her to take it down and apologize, she told me she did not regret the post and why wasn't I happy she loved me that much. I accused her of trying to rub it into my mom's face that she had stabbed her in the back and won the love of my sister and me after betraying her with our dad like she did. She told me it was 20 years ago and mom should be over it.\n\nI decided not to include her in any wedding planning. She is a wedding planner as a profession and I know she would want to, but I am not happy with her post. Mom was so happy when I told her. But when my stepmom wanted to know when she'd be dress shopping with me and what I wanted her help with, I told her I did not want her involved in any wedding planning.\n\nShe and my dad are saying I am overreacting and should not be treating her this way when she has been a damn good parent to me.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1667930591, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yptqix/aita_for_excluding_my_stepmom_from_helping_plan/", "score": 52, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She\u2019s creepy as fuck. Her first born? It\u2019s like she\u2019s been planning on trying to take your mom\u2019s life from the beginning. She\u2019s sick and shouldn\u2019t be anywhere near your wedding.", "**NTA.**  My God how dense is this woman? She practically put it out there for everyone to see that she knowingly was having an affair with your dad ***while your mom was pregnant with you!*** If this was me, she's be lucky to get a damned invite to the wedding. Tell her she is reaping the consequences of f\\*ck around, find out, 20 years later. \n\nI'm practically spitting fire at this woman's audacity. \n\n>She and my dad are saying I am overreacting and should not be treating her this way when she has been a damn good parent to me\n\nNo, she is not being a good parent to you by putting up that post knowing it was going to hurt your mom. That's being a something I can't write or I will get banned.", "NTA - she way overstepped with that post and now you know who she truly is, but a \u201cbest friend\u201d who has an affair with your husband, yeah she\u2019s always been bad news. glowing praise on your mom for bearing this gracefully for years and not getting in the way of you finding out for yourself.", "NTA\n\n\n\nHer mask slipped and now you know who she really is.\n\n\nLet them threaten to not come, let them insult you and your mom, let them make themselves out to be victims.\n\n\nYou mother was not only screwed over by the 2 closest people in your life, but she was going to be pushed out by them too for tour wedding.\n\n\nHer post showed that she would make herself the mother of the bride, she was going to take it over.  I wouldn't even invite her.", "NTA. You are the bride and you get to decide whose help you want in planning your wedding. If that doesn\u2019t include your father\u2019s wife, so be it.", "NTA.\n\nStep-mom's post is really tacky and awful.  You no longer view her in the same way and why would you want her toxic air during wedding planning?  You and your mom will have a lovely bonding experience planning your wedding.  \n\nI'm sure step-mom will \"get over it.\"  May take 20 years but she'll get over it!  LOL!", "NTA. This is the problem with deceit: your forget where the deceit ends and the truth begins. Being your mom\u2019s former best friend, your step mom has obviously known you for a long time but her post reveals that she\u2019s had a close relationship with your dad for even longer than you were led to believe. It also shows that sometimes when you give someone an inch, they take a mile. You and your sister showed so much maturity and grace by trying not to judge your step mom by the person she was then and instead focus on who she is now.  Instead of being grateful for that grace, she got cocky and basically showed you that she has no regrets for what she did. I don\u2019t blame you for keeping her a arms length from now on.", "Holy shit NTA. Your stepmom is evil mastermind levels of asshole. The whole \"since birth thing\" is deeply disturbing in its implications.", "NTA.\n\nAnd I'd be tempted to respond to that post with something like:  So are you saying that you and my dad were having an affair when my mom (his wife) was pregnant with his child too?\n\nSeems like your dad is a total A H who simply used his first wife as a baby factory or he married his stalker.     He's definitely not in a position to be judging your behavior or giving you advice.", "NTA. \n\nAside from the normal 'It's your wedding, do what you want', this information has made you reevaluate your relationship to both your father and your stepmother. \n\nYou have every right to feel what you're feeling right now. \n\nI would suggest you consider writing it all out in a letter to e-mail, putting down whatever boundaries you need to. It's not a negotiation smd don't let them tell you otherwise.", "NTA Its your wedding and you deserve to have only the people and energies you want involved. \n\nActions have consequences, even if they show up 20 years late. You gave her the opportunity to rectify at least this situation, and she chose to mock your mother and insult you. Why would you want a person so easily able and willing to do that anywhere near your nuptials? She'll be lucky to get an invite.", "NTA\n\nShe doesn\u2019t know the meaning of Stay In Your Lane. She\u2019ll take over your wedding if you involve her and cause endless drama.", "NTA, damn good people still get consequences for doing damn stupid things.", "NTA\nYou are not overreacting. She betrayed your mother and was half the reason for the divorce.", "NTA.  It\u2019s not your mom\u2019s responsibility to get over deceit.  Congrats on the engagement! I hope you and your bio mom have an awesome time with the wedding planning.  Can your future FIL walk you down the aisle?", "NTA. First of all, you don't have to include anyone you don't want to into your wedding. Secondly, yes, that's exactly how her post looked, very crass and tasteless.", "NTA\n\nThat post was distasteful. You gave her an out- to take it down. She chose not to do that.\nYour.mom.sounds.amazing for not stopping you or your sister from having. Agoos relationship with your father/stepmom. Stepmom sucks though", "NTA she was deliberate in hurting your mom.  She had already won and wasn't considering how it would make the kids feel.", "NTA at all\n\nYour step mom reminds me so much of my dad's sister-in-law, extremely nice, caring, and all smiles on the outside but deep down is a cold, manipulative, and evil woman.\n\nAnd just like with your step mom, it took a LONG time, after I grew up, for the mask to finally fall off\n\nWe've cut off contact with their family and you should absolutely do the same with your step mom\n\nBTW congrats on your engagement! Please spend your big day with the people who genuinely love you :)", "NTA and I would be brutally blunt with her that her post woke you up to the fact that she planned to betray your mom from the very beginning and that she's legitimately proud of being a homewrecking mistress and that you no longer trust that she has, or has EVER had, good intentions regarding you and that, if you had realized just how predatory she has been about your family, you would have cut her off years ago, so she can count herself lucky if you even invite her to the wedding. If your dad gets on you about it, tell him that the opinion of a cheater is worthless to you and he will also be lucky to be invited to the wedding.", "Side note I would like to suggest you comment on her post and respond with \u201cI\u2019m the daughter of your best friend who you screwed over by screwing her husband. I\u2019m not your first born anything.\u201d", "You rock!!! You are amazing!!! Someone shouldn\u2019t be helping you plan to be faithful to your spouse and love them...when they were cheating their way into a marriage. Nope just Nope.

Don't listen to them - they can't be trusted.", "NTA, wow, stepmom may have treated you well in other respects but that post was beyond tacky. Frankly, it speaks to some very creepy motives on her part. \n\nHowever you decide to handle that, you are well within your rights now not to involve her in the planning of an event that will also include your mother; SM has all but advertised she intends to minimize bio mom's role as much as she can.", "NTA she knew exactly what she was doing when she made the post pure example of fuck around an find out", "NTA\n\nYour dad\u2019s wife is not a nice person.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She\u2019s planned since your\nMother was pregnant to take vet her life and is creepy af and quite frankly evil", "NTA\n\nThe audacity of them saying your mom should get over it when 20 years later *they* are the ones trying to one-up her, publicly humiliate her, and have refused to apologise. Holy wow.\n\nLooks like you didn't get the whole truth when you found out at 19. They've withheld some pretty damning and creepy facts from you about when this whole affair started and their plan for you (I blame your dad aswell but understand that might be more difficult to deal with).\n\nYou've done nothing wrong by cutting stepmom out of this situation. It's her actions having consequences.", "NTA\n\nShe knew what she was doing when she wrote the post. I have a similar situation with my stepmum. When I was 14 she turned to my dad and said happy 18th anniversary! I was sat right there! Again, she knew what she was doing. I\u2019m now 31 and still hold it against her and him. People like them ruin lives, break hearts and just expect people to be okay with it. I\u2019m glad you stood your ground", "NTA she is completely uncaring of your mother's feelings. She says she doesn't regret the post but make it clear it had its consequences. \n\nIt would also not help your mother to have to be in the same room for dress fittings, florist visits etc. You're putting your mother first which is perfectly fine in this situation.\n\nEnjoy the prep with your mother and sister and  try not to let her spoil things.", "That's how it read to me. It also read to me like she had planned the affair with my dad before anything had happened for real.", "Yeah, she's got some big brass ones to talk publicly about how she and *her best friend's husband* were talking about this day while he was still married, and then be all shocked Pikachu face when OP doesn't want her involved in the wedding.", "I was weirded out too about the step mom's post as well. Her first born????\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOP, your Bio mom gets an award for being an amazing parent. She put your happiness above her own. Go Mom.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA - People's actions have consequences. Your step mom's actions 20 years ago have consequences now. That is something your stepmom needs to deal with, not you.\n\nI need to say \"GO BIO MOM\" one more time. That had to have been extremely difficult for your bio mom, but she did it for you and your sibling.", "So what, your mom was just an incubator in this weird fantasy she\u2019s built for herself? She\u2019s unbelievable! What she wrote was so inappropriate, I\u2019m honestly shocked she wasn\u2019t torn apart in the comments on her post. \n\nThere\u2019s tacky, and then there\u2019s your step-mother.", "Or, that they were already having an affair when your mom was pregnant with you.\n\nHonestly, it doesn\u2019t even read that she wants to do this out of love for you. It reads like she wants to help with your wedding to stick it to your mom. The whole relationship between her and your sister seems like it is based on winning to her."]}
