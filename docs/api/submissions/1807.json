While being petty is satisfying, it does sound like you do/did love or at least have good memories with your stepmom. You've made it clear to her why she's being excluded from the planning.

Said it just once, and nothing else.\n\nFast forward to when I was 20, and I had to have my mom sue my dad to pay the support he was ordered (WA post-secondary support bureaucracy rules there), I asked to read the court file.
