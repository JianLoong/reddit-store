I found out I was pregnant in Feb. of this year but miscarried soon after. When I told my bf, he freaked out and had a panic attack. He isn't\u2019 ready to have a child and I understand that, but he kind of made it all about him. He sulked in his room, and berated me about when I was going to terminate. I kept saying I didn\u2019t know, and I wasn\u2019t 100% sure if I wanted to terminate. My answer caused him to be more rude and passive aggressive towards me which put a lot of stress on me. Part of me thinks this is why I lost the baby. \n\nThis brings us to today, my bf turns 21. I planned dinner at our favorite spot and set up a night out this friday w/ his friends. I\u2019m usually better at planning stuff but I\u2019ve been really stressed out lately. (This is partially why I think I am the asshole as I always plan an elaborate celebration for his bday and put a ton of effort into his presents). But, I graduated college last weekend, hosted a party, and it was Mothers Day so I had a lot going on. Anyway, stress usually makes my period late by a week or so and eliminates all of my menstrual symptoms. \n\nYesterday, my bf and I drove up to his family to celebrate his bday. On the drive up, I realized my period was late and my bf started stressing out. I assured him it was likely stress that affected my cycle and I haven\u2019t experienced any symptoms like last time. He relaxed and we had a good time at his family\u2019s party. \n\nWhen I woke up this morning I took a test, and it was positive. I decided to avoid telling my bf as it would cause him anxiety and I wanted him to enjoy his day. I laid back in bed and he woke up to go take his morning dump. I completely forgot to hide the test sitting on the counter and he always takes a dump in the 2nd bathroom b/c he thinks I won\u2019t hear his explosive shits (I hear them every time). He comes back out asking if I\u2019m pregnant and I said yes. Immediately shuts down. I told him not to worry, it may be a false positive and enjoy today. He goes quiet the rest of the morning. \n\nAlso, I\u2019m a nanny for my bf\u2019s niece. I went to go pick her up and when I came back my bf was still in bed. I ask if I should make an appt at a clinic, he says yes, and I make one for the next hour. The clinic confirms the pregnancy, I tell him and like last time, he starts berating me, asking when I\u2019m going to terminate. I tell him, \u201cIdk I JUST found out please stop asking me.\u201d As we\u2019re driving home, his niece starts crying and he yells \u201cSTOP CRYING FUCK.\u201d I was shocked, and chewed him out while I comforted her. When we get home, he goes straight to bed and avoids me. \n\nI feel bad that he found out I\u2019m pregnant the day of his bday, and that I didn\u2019t plan more of a celebration, so he had to chill at home during the day. I didn\u2019t want him to find out today, but I made a mistake. AITA?\n\nEdit (info): I have the arm implant, however it \u201cexpired\u201d in January. The previous clinic did not inform me of this and YES I asked how it was possible. They gave me the spiel that no form of bc is 100% preventative. This clinic informed me the implant was ineffective. \n\nEdit 2: Nowhere in this post did I say I am actively trying to conceive. Nor am I trying to trap him. I am not ready for a child, last time I found out my hormones swayed my sureness to terminate. I apologize I got attached and was conflicted about abortion.", "created_utc": 1684889561, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13q6e4j/aita_for_taking_a_pregnancy_test_the_day_of_my/", "score": 2457, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And no where does it say that OP had it and expired after 3 years of implanting. Also matter of fact she had 2 pregnancies with this current guy in the past 1.5 year. They started dating over 2 years ago. From the timeline OP shared. So yes good chance of it being faulty.", "Ugh mine made it to where i never had a cycle UNTIL i got it removed, ill never go back to those implants or inserts screw that lol", "It could be possible they found out it was expired/ineffective when she came in for the pregnancy check. Maybe not by date but either by removal of the implant and investigating it after or testing for the levels of the BC present in her body. If the tests come back saying the BC isn\u2019t there, they might just say it\u2019s expired or ineffective. \n\nThat\u2019s a guess but I have no clue what actually happened with that.

Not to mention, I'm underweight so...", "My doctor told me its good for 5 years because of studies. I've had it for nearly 5 years, coming up in August (dw im replacing it next month). Never had a problem with pregnacy.\n\nShe told me the only reason it officially says 3 years is because it hasnt gone through the FDA or something to approve the 5 year claim. But there have been studies showing it works for 5 years. I'm not overweight though so that probably helps. I am not surprised it doesn't last for 5 years in overweight women, since that also applies to other medicines with dosage amount.\n\nDon't think its OP's fault. My doctor and Kaiser and PP told me 5 years.", "It sounds like he wasnt worried. If he was, he would have put a condom on.

That is toxic, selfish behaviour and for me would result in immediate use of the 'eject' button. \n\nBirth control can fail. It's a risk we take when we have unprotected sex. It seems all the liability of that rests with you, as does the emotional burden of caring for yourself and your very immature partner, who has offered nothing more than sulking and pressure, which certainly doesn't help when you have to make a decision about termination, regardless of how cavalierly some might view abortion (just because it's readily available doesn't mean it's not stressful to go through, and that the decision is painless). \n\nI'd say the easy decision is abort the boyfriend then you can just focus on reaching emotional safety for yourself so you can make pregnancy-related decisions. \n\nNTA for ruining his birthday.

It just sounds like the implant is new for her and she\u2019s figuring it out as best she can. But seriously, people are not perfect and she tried her best. Put yourself in someone else\u2019s shoes for once. I bet on your life you have situations where you feel you \u201cshould have\u201d done better but in reality you couldn\u2019t have because past you didn\u2019t have the information you have now to do better.", "I\u2019m not overlooking anything.\n\nFirst point:\n\nShe did not KNOW it was expired until after the second positive and has mentioned in comments (or the edit, not sure which one) that she WAS told it expired later.\n\nSecond point: \n\nYes, she should have looked into the reason. But in her situation you could easily assume that it just failed once statistically.\n\nThird point:\n\nThat is a weird point. All birth controls fail, should we no longer be using them because of that? Really, the solution to be even safer is to double up. Which he couldn\u2019t be bothered to do on his end.\n\nFourth point:\n\nUh you are supposed to be able to have condomless sex on other forms of birth control unless you also need STD protection? That\u2019s why they\u2019re called options? She should absolutely dump his ass and he should never sleep with anyone if he feels this strongly and is this volatile. But, that\u2019s a step for her to take now. People are dumb when they love someone and will stay for longer than they should. Sunk cost fallacy.\n\nThere is a difference between not knowing things and actually having malice, hence why he is the AH", "I\u2019m making perfect sense if you actually read the entire comment thread. The argument was being made that she should have been using other forms of protection, as if the implant is unreliable when to her knowledge it was still active. My point is that nobody would say that about a condom breaking, for example. Maybe you got an expired condom in a box by mistake and as a result it fails. It doesn\u2019t mean you no longer trust condoms ever. Either way, the result is failure unbeknownst to the person using it until it is too late. And, yes, believe it or not, birth control fails when it is expired. That\u2019s one of the many reasons it can fail LOL"]}
