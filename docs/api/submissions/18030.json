I found out I was pregnant in Feb. of this year but miscarried soon after. When I told my bf, he freaked out and had a panic attack. He isn't\u2019 ready to have a child and I understand that, but he kind of made it all about him. He sulked in his room, and berated me about when I was going to terminate. I kept saying I didn\u2019t know, and I wasn\u2019t 100% sure if I wanted to terminate. My answer caused him to be more rude and passive aggressive towards me which put a lot of stress on me. Part of me thinks this is why I lost the baby. \n\nThis brings us to today, my bf turns 21. I planned dinner at our favorite spot and set up a night out this friday w/ his friends. I\u2019m usually better at planning stuff but I\u2019ve been really stressed out lately. (This is partially why I think I am the asshole as I always plan an elaborate celebration for his bday and put a ton of effort into his presents). But, I graduated college last weekend, hosted a party, and it was Mothers Day so I had a lot going on. Anyway, stress usually makes my period late by a week or so and eliminates all of my menstrual symptoms. \n\nYesterday, my bf and I drove up to his family to celebrate his bday. On the drive up, I realized my period was late and my bf started stressing out. I assured him it was likely stress that affected my cycle and I haven\u2019t experienced any symptoms like last time. He relaxed and we had a good time at his family\u2019s party. \n\nWhen I woke up this morning I took a test, and it was positive. I decided to avoid telling my bf as it would cause him anxiety and I wanted him to enjoy his day. I laid back in bed and he woke up to go take his morning dump. I completely forgot to hide the test sitting on the counter and he always takes a dump in the 2nd bathroom b/c he thinks I won\u2019t hear his explosive shits (I hear them every time). He comes back out asking if I\u2019m pregnant and I said yes. Immediately shuts down. I told him not to worry, it may be a false positive and enjoy today. He goes quiet the rest of the morning. \n\nAlso, I\u2019m a nanny for my bf\u2019s niece. I went to go pick her up and when I came back my bf was still in bed. I ask if I should make an appt at a clinic, he says yes, and I make one for the next hour. The clinic confirms the pregnancy, I tell him and like last time, he starts berating me, asking when I\u2019m going to terminate. I tell him, \u201cIdk I JUST found out please stop asking me.\u201d As we\u2019re driving home, his niece starts crying and he yells \u201cSTOP CRYING FUCK.\u201d I was shocked, and chewed him out while I comforted her. When we get home, he goes straight to bed and avoids me. \n\nI feel bad that he found out I\u2019m pregnant the day of his bday, and that I didn\u2019t plan more of a celebration, so he had to chill at home during the day. I didn\u2019t want him to find out today, but I made a mistake. AITA?\n\nEdit (info): I have the arm implant, however it \u201cexpired\u201d in January. The previous clinic did not inform me of this and YES I asked how it was possible. They gave me the spiel that no form of bc is 100% preventative. This clinic informed me the implant was ineffective. \n\nEdit 2: Nowhere in this post did I say I am actively trying to conceive. Nor am I trying to trap him. I am not ready for a child, last time I found out my hormones swayed my sureness to terminate. I apologize I got attached and was conflicted about abortion.", "created_utc": 1684889561, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13q6e4j/aita_for_taking_a_pregnancy_test_the_day_of_my/", "score": 125, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
