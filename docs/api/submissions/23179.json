It sounds like you've made your wishes well known. She must not want to sell the condo and maybe - because you are like a dog with a bone - she doesn't want to talk to you about it. All of your concerns that were \"well-communicated and well-articulated\", lol, are all one-sided. Surely she has a reason to want to keep the condo or she'd sell it. Simple as that. YTA for picking fights with your wife. Sounds like there's a lot more to the story than you're telling us. Maybe the condo is her safe space and possible exit strategy.", "INFO: do they jointly own the condo?", "NAH. It is fair for you to want to inspect (both) your financial obligations and figure out together what is best for your family. It's also fair for her to consider real estate to be a good investment, or to have other reasons for retaining the property. You mention she isn't receiving any rent but also said she's paying *her part* of the mortgage - if she isn't paying 100% of the mortgage she shouldn't necessarily be collecting rent. Her agreement with her sister may be that sister's share of the mortgage is equivalent to rent. Depending on the interest rate they have on the property, in the US at least, it's quite possible it's a good investment. It seems like you're seeing this as her funneling money to help her sister that should be benefiting you / your kid instead, and that is definitely something to look at. But I think this situation needs communication and discussion - is your wife willing to make a plan to get out of the condo? If not, what is her rationale? Does she agree your family needs that money to go elsewhere?", "Well, finances are always one of the hardest things to solve in marriage. Have you and your wife actually made a plan together, are you just assuming she is onboard with your plan or you have basically forced her to go along with yours? \n\nBecause plenty of people don't have \"exit strategies\" for residential real estate: they are fine with the rental, even if cap rates are low, because of potential long term price appreciations and rental inflation adjustments. Maybe what you should be convincing your wife to do is to charge a rental fee to her sister so she has an additional income source even if it isn't much.\n\nNow, the hardest question: if you buy a house, under whose name is going to be? Joint? Yours? Hers? Because I can give you the obvious answer if you are planning to buy a house under your name: the condo is insurance for her and she is perfectly fine with having her sister live there.\n\nAs for the verdict: YTA if you are just pressuring your wife without considering why she might want to keep the condo. NTA otherwise.", "Yeah YTA, her sister basically is paying rent by paying part of the mortgage off even though your wife owns the house. Once it's paid off you've got a decent asset for the future.\n\nYou actually sound pretty condescending and arrogantly holier-than-thou, she owned the house before you came along, she's perfectly within her rights to keep it - and from her point of view, it's also an insurance policy in case you two split. She also can't just make her sister homeless. There's a million sensible, perfectly valid reasons for her to keep the house.\n\nIf you'd really raised your \"concerns\" in \"well-communicated and well-articulated manner\" then you wouldn't have ended up instigating \"emotional arguments\". It's also odd you're talking about your wife and family like you're writing a corporate HR email tbh.\n\nYTA.", "NTA\n\nIt doesn't matter though because you seem to confuse \"building equity\" with \"generating income\".\n\nIt could do both but her sister likely can't afford to buy your sister out and having her \"pay rent\" just means she's paying all the mortgage plus some on top without building equity for herself.", "NTA but you may want to bring in a neutral third party, like a financial advisor, to help in this situation.", "If you own a house partially with another person it's normal for the other person to pay rent if they have sole occupation of the property.\n\nThe amount that ops wife should be getting from renting half the property out is op's wife supporting her sister.\n\nOP feels that supporting sister is the priority over the relationship.\n\nYou are subsidising your sil's lifestyle here. Furthermore your wife told you she would exit the investment and has failed to do so.\n\nNta", "I'm torn on this one.\n\nOn the one hand, you knew she had this condo before you married. Was there any conversation around what her intentions were upon moving in with you? Was there a discussion with her & her sister as to what future options were with the condo? If this wasn't discussed before the marriage, then I'd have to side with your wife.   \n\n\nOn the other hand, you want to ensure your family is financially secure and the money she pays towards the mortgage on the condo eats away at this security. I can appreciate where you're coming from. \n\nI reserve my judgement based on these 2 sides of the coin. I do suggest you get a financial consultant to go over a budget TOGETHER. Maybe if she hears this from someone other than you, she may be open to a bigger conversation. Also, couples counseling would be a good option. You say you have provided a well-articulated view. Maybe in your POV, but she may have a different perspective.\n\nGood luck!", "Her rationale is that she doesn\u2019t want to kick her sister out and that she\u2019s building equity.  But this makes no sense to me if she\u2019s not receiving rental income.  This equity can be invested and used for our next home, or for a rental property that benefits our family.", "IMO the way it should work is this: (made up figures)\n\nIf mortgage is 1000, that's 500 each. If the place should rent for 800, then sister should be giving your wife 400 for rent, and she can add 100 to it to pay her portion of the mortgage. \n\nIf mortgage is 1000 and rent should be 1200, then sister should be paying your wife 600 for rent, from which she can pay her half of the mortgage and get 100 profit. \n\nIn both cases repairs that a landlord would be responsible for should be split equally, and bills etc should be the sisters responsibility.\n\n\nOr just sell it, that would be easier, NTA", "NAH. I get your concern but this condo may as well be her exit plan in case smth happens between you. It was purchased before marriage so she won't have to split it. But yeah, it would be seisuble to rent her part of the condo so the mortgage is covered by the tenant.", "NTA.  If this was something she was done paying for, I may think differently.  But she is paying a mortgage for a place she isn't living, which is taking away from money for your household.", "The Eastern-European grandmother of a friend, who lost all her family properties after WW2 only to get some - not so valueable ones - back, told her to only sell property for 2 reasons: health and education, but otherwise keep it. I consider this good advise.", "NTA. You have tried to raise some legitimate financial concerns with your wife in what you say is a well-communicated way. However, a bit more information would be welcome as to what her response is and why the discussions become emotional. Also, why does your wife need a plan to exit the condo? Is it not a good investment?", "NTA. You are partially supporting your SIL. Within a reasonable amount of time SIL needs to pay the entire cost of the condo, sell it, or find a roommate to offset expenses. You are not being unreasonable.", "NTA-I don\u2019t know why your wife isn\u2019t on board, but I suggest you both meet with a qualified CFP asap. As a third party, the CFP would be able to explain how this is impacting your future as well as explain the rest of your family goals. If you can find a good female one in the area, even better. Make sure you keep your mouth shut during the appointment when the CFP asks about the unit. Let your wife explain. \n\nYour wife isn\u2019t an AH either. She just doesn\u2019t want your marriage to affect her sister when it was not in your sister\u2019s control. If your sister is anywhere close to getting married, you\u2019ll have a natural out-as long as your wife doesn\u2019t cave on them living in the condo. \n\nI don\u2019t know why everyone in the comments is so confused about the issue. Your wife definitely has her head in the sand & she is being willingly used by her sister through their own agreement. This condo situation is a financial disaster. I\u2019m sorry your wife doesn\u2019t see that. \n\nI know it doesn\u2019t matter as your wife isn\u2019t listening, but there are 3 reasonable options that would be fair to BOTH sisters. Your sister could buy out your wife at today\u2019s market value, sister could move and they could rent out the condo, or sister could move and they could sell the condo.", "Maybe agree that sister needs to get a sub letter/lodger that pays half the mortgage.. then look on it as an investment", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She has continued to pay her part of the mortgage for the condo her sister continues to live in, without getting any rent or income in return.\n\nI\u2019m very financially responsible, and am constantly saving and investing, and am setting goals in preparation for us move into a larger house so we can accommodate a second child in the near future.\n\nMy wife and her sister somehow still do not have a plan in place to exit this condo, which has made me very frustrated.  She doesn\u2019t make a lot of money, I am caring for the majority of our expenses and savings, and this is money that can be put to more responsible  use as we plan for our new nuclear family\u2019s future.  I feel bad for getting in between them, but as a matter of priorities, it feels like we should be focusing together on the things that matter to our family.  I\u2019ve raised this concern in a very well-communicated and well-articulated way, that this is something that needs to be addressed before we responsibly bring another child into our family. \n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
