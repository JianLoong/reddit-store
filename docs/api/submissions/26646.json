He\u2019ll call his mother for hours and talk to her and spend time with her more than he does with me. I recently hit my 6 month mark in my pregnancy, and asked my husband to help me get ready with all sorts of things the baby. He said that would interfere with time spent with his mom and replied with \u201cyeah it might, but I need you more right now and would you if you did some other time\u201d. He gave me an offended look and said \u201cyou know my mom comes before you\u201d? I was kind of shocked but I explained to him that we just needed to get ready with a few things here and there and that I wouldn\u2019t need more help later in the week. He just ignored me and went to his mom\u2019s house. After a while, she called me and said \u201cI won\u201d, in a snarky voice and I just bite my tongue and said \u201cmaybe I\u2019ll win next time\u201dand she hanged up. I could hear my husband laughing in the background and that just angered me for while and I was walking around lifting my fold up upstairs. It hurt like hell, by got it done. I decided to paint the nursery walls another day. \n\n\nOur anniversary rolls around the corner a couple weeks later and I woke up and got my husband\u2019s gift ready that day and cooked his favorite meal. He came back from work and I was upstairs in the bathroom and he left. I got all eager and happy that he was bringing some sort of surprise and waited in the living  room. 30 minutes go by and I call him saying where are you. He replies with \u201coh I\u2019m at my moms house\u201d. I don\u2019t appreciate what I said about this so don\u2019t go to hard in the comments. \u201c She might as well be having your kid you clearly seem like your with her\u201d. I hung up the phone and it was probably in speaker phone and minutes later I get a bunch of text from them saying that I shouldn\u2019t be jealous, I shouldn\u2019t respect my mother in law, and that I should maybe find something to do instead of being a bitter asshole. AITA?\n\n\n\nUpdate: I read through the comments, oh boy.  My husband and I have been together for 5 years and we\u2019re married for 1/2 years. I never really noticed things like this because of me being the blind person I am to these kinda things. I think it all started when we got married because as soon as we did she lived with us for about a month before \u201cleaving my all grown son\u201d.  I think my MIL is competing with me and I might even have to give my husband and ultimatum  because after reading these comments things could only get worse from here. I\u2019ve talked to my husband after I posted this (didn\u2019t tell him about it) and asked why he visits his mom so often. His only response was that she was an important person in his life and he\u2019s great full to her. Bullshit. I\u2019ve now only realized that my husband has been acting as if he\u2019s married to his mom. I\u2019m seriously considering getting a divorce because of what I been reading. My MIL has no intentions of changing her behavior.
