Say what you mean. If you say the OPPOSITE of what you ACTUALLY WANT then it's completely on YOU that you got the thing you asked for instead of the thing you wanted.\n2. When your \"opposite day\" approach to asking for something spectacularly backfires, the only one you can blame is yourself. It's not your wife (OP) fault that she didn't do something that you told her NOT TO DO. What you should do is laugh at the absurd situation you created - NOT berate your poor overburdened wife for failing to read your mind.\n3. Also, appreciate the celebration you got. Don't be a grumpy jerk because it didn't meet your (secret) expectations.\n4. Just because it's your birthday (even a milestone like 40) does not mean your postpartum wife's life should be put into stress overdrive to celebrate you. Instead of thinking about yourself, maybe think about your family and what they need. A cozy low-key celebration with a beautiful young family can be very rewarding and special if you stop obsessing over yourself. Not every year can be a big party, some years call for something simple. This is determined by the capacity for celebrating the family has in any particular year, NOT the age. Some years you have the resources/bandwidth to go all out, some years (like when you've got a newborn) it's just not in the cards.\n\nAs for you wife/OP. You did the best you could. Tell your husband you are sorry he was disappointed but you really need him to say what he means from now on. And that you don't like to disappoint him and plan to make up it for it next year.
