I told them i was cleaning up a grave because someone had done it for my grandpa. As soon as i it was because my grandpa grave had been cleaned up they started talking about how i didnt know whether the weeds and dead leaves scattered around the grave was on purpose or not and they told me to leave. I kept working as they talked smack and then i drove off. So im pretty sure im not but am i the asshole\n\nEdit since i think theres some confusion about what i did to the grave: i removed dead leaves, some thinly sprewn about wild grass and a weed called a \u201cm\u00e6lkeb\u00f8tte\u201d in danish.

It's my family's grave, not yours.", "We don't know people's reasons. It's their grave.", "It's a graveyard. But the grave is not just a hole in the ground with a tombstone like you see in American movies. \n\nIt's usually a family grave, that is to be cared for by the family. And that you have to pay taxes to continue to call your own.\n\nSomething like this if you want to take a look https://static.globalnoticias.pt/dn/image.jpg?brand=DN&type=generate&guid=3aae9889-6da5-4b45-8f20-7938f653d49d", "I can understand not wanting it vandalized, but we're talking the complete opposite here. If you can't be bothered to care for the grave, don't get mad if someone else does.\n\nETA: especially if that grave is next to a grave of one of my loved ones.", "And someone will take care of that after you die and stop paying taxes. People will take pictures. People will pick up litter. People will do grave rubbings. If you don't like it, don't use a graveyard.", "You don't have to understand. If the grave is my family's, my family's is the one who have a say in it.", "Maybe where you're from. Here people are respectful enough to not litter or mess around graves in a graveyard.\n\nAnd yeah, we have people to do shit. Never heard of that being done in a graveyard.", "Don't care, sorry not sorry if you want a dead child's grave to be messy.", "Well, if your family is the kind to abandon a grave, something tells me they're not going to notice if someone cleans it up. \n\nHave a nice day, mean-suit. I hope you wear your nice suit tomorrow \ud83e\ude75", "It's not yours to care about, simple as that.", "My family isn't. Sorry to disappoint you. I am capable of judging on things that don't affect me personally. We take very good care of the family grave, thank you very much\n\nBut if we didn't, it'd be our business, no one else's.", "and you're an asshole if you have a dead child's grave in your family that you don't care one bit about.\n\n\nIf you don't give a shit about it, I can't change that.\n\nBut who the fuck are you to say I can't tend to a child's grave?\n\nA family member who doesn't care one bit and who doesn't tend the grave themself?"]}
