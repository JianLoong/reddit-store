I told them i was cleaning up a grave because someone had done it for my grandpa. As soon as i it was because my grandpa grave had been cleaned up they started talking about how i didnt know whether the weeds and dead leaves scattered around the grave was on purpose or not and they told me to leave. I kept working as they talked smack and then i drove off. So im pretty sure im not but am i the asshole\n\nEdit since i think theres some confusion about what i did to the grave: i removed dead leaves, some thinly sprewn about wild grass and a weed called a \u201cm\u00e6lkeb\u00f8tte\u201d in danish.
