We lived together in an apartment before getting married and now we live in a house I inherited from my grandmother.\n\nThis summer has been quite hot and so like most people, we have been running our air conditioner nearly around the clock. My wife and I have very different ideas of how we should run it though. Using energy saver recommendations, I like to keep it at around 76 Fahrenheit and on low. My wife likes to turn it down to 60 degrees and blast it on the highest setting, then turn it off when she gets cold, then turn it back on again when she gets hot.\n\nI've tried discussing this with her but there's literally nothing I can do or say to convince her. She currently stays at home taking care of the house while I go to work, and the second I'm out the door, the thermostat is messed with. I've tried showing her our exorbitantly expensive power bill (from May of all months so it was only going to go up) but she doesn't care. She says that she's at home all day and so she should have control over it.\n\nWe've argued about this on and off since. About three weeks ago I got a reservation for a new digital thermostat installation. The guys finally came in a few days ago and installed a new smart thermostat off our older air conditioning unit. The first thing I did was password protect it so you would need a PIN to change any of the settings. \n\nMy wife came home a few hours after I had set the PIN and noticed the new unit. When she tried to change the settings she was met with a request for a PIN, and she asked me what it was. I told her that I wouldn't be telling her that. Then she asked what she should do if she gets hot. I responded that she can still turn the air conditioning on and off without the PIN. \n\nThe next morning I left for work as normal, setting it to 76. When I got home in the afternoon I found my wife on the living room floor pantomiming a fainting spell. She mustered the energy to say \"Help ... water ...\" I ignored her because you faint from heat in a climate-controlled room. When she realized I wouldn't give her attention she exploded in anger and yelled that she could have died, prompting another argument. She ended it with calling me \"controlling\" and hasn't said more than a word to me since.\n\nThings have been rough for the past couple of days. I feel like what I did was completely justified but was I an asshole about this?", "created_utc": 1690082858, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1573qq0/aita_for_upgrading_my_houses_thermostat_so_i/", "score": 50, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Set it at 72/73 as a compromise.", "This is a hard one; on one hand she doesn't seem to care about the massive bill and is not working, so the tells me she's kind of entitled.  On the other hand, I'd be very uncomfortable at a 76 degree set a/c.  I wouldn't be dying mind you but uncomfortable...she wants to blast it at 60 and that's causing your bill to be extremely high.  You tried talking to her about it but she just disregarded it then you did get controlling and got the system with the pin.  I think you both are being jerks to be honest..... why not try a compromise and try setting it to 72 and see if that's a bit more comfortable for her?  Personally 68 is my comfort zone", "ESH - She is being unreasonable.  I agree that setting the thermostat at 60 and turning it on and off repeatedly is wasteful and will cause a lot of unnecessary wear and tear to the A/C unit.  That said, doing this behind her back is essentially treating her like a child. ( Yes, she is acting like a child, but you can't actually treat her like one, because that's an unhealthy relationship dynamic.)\n\nYou guys need couple's counseling to help you figure out if there is something bigger at play that is causing her to latch onto this A/C issue as a form of control in your relationship.  Or maybe she is always unreasonable, and you need to figure out if you can live with that and how to deal with her behavior without being unreasonably controlling yourself.", "YTA. It's not just your hours and just your thermostat. You're going to have to reach a *compromise* like adults. She's not your child. And no person under 90 years old keeps the AC at 76. Where do you go to work? If it's indoors, I guarantee it's not 76 degrees in there. Sounds like she's the one at home during the heat of the day. Why don't you talk to her about keeping on 72 or something and seeing how that goes.", "YTA. You tried to have a conversation, and when you couldn\u2019t convince her, you just put in a new thermostat that only you could control. Good job coming to a compromise with your spouse. \n\nAnd then the kicker is that you aren\u2019t even there. So you decide what should be comfortable for her.  Which so happens to be EXACTLY what YOU want. \n\nYou give her zero consideration and zero input. What she wants has no impact on your decision. You don\u2019t adjust it by a single degree. That is pretty much the definition of controlling. \n\nHow do you convince yourself that you aren\u2019t the asshole?", "You're both freaking childish\n\n\nESH", "YTA. She\u2019s your wife and she\u2019s uncomfortable, at least she is at 76. Compromise on a number and set the thermostat.", "YTA\n\nBut 60 is ridicilous.

You ARE controlling. You are literally controlling the fucking temperature she can have. Holy shit, dude.", "YTA 76 is not comfortable for most people. Yes the electric company recommends a higher temperature because they don't care about your comfort. You need to find a temperature to compromise on because her way is stupid also.", "[deleted]", "YTA 76 is not comfortable. Maybe 72 in the summer.

You don't have any right to deny her access to anything in her own house.\n\nThe only thing you have any right to do is come to some kind of mutual agreement.\n\nIf it is impossible to come to a mutual agreement then tough shit. That's life too. You still don't have any right to deny her access to anything in her own home. You can divorce her if you want if the thermostat is that important to you.\n\nFor what it's worth I had a roommate put a lockbox over a thermostat in the summer because they didn't like paying their 1/4 share of the bill so I smashed it with a hammer.\n\nI had another roommate in the same situation shut off the breaker for the AC, put a cheap lock on the breaker box, and lie to everyone else in the house saying that the AC was broken, after they had complained about their 1/4 of the bill and lost a house vote on the matter. Then keep \"forgetting\" to call the landlord to get it fixed, so I found the breaker box, broke the cheap lock off, flipped the breaker, and put an expensive lock on them told everyone I had miraculously fixed the AC.\n\nIf I was OPs wife I'd be smashing his new thermostat with a hammer and he'd be paying for that too.\n\nThat being said I don't know what's wrong with her either.

Compromise.", "YTA. She\u2019s at home all day and I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re the bread winner because of that. Instead of badgering her to live within your means, you need to cater to her needs WHEN SHE is the one at home all day and taking care of it. \n\nIf you disagree with this then you shouldn\u2019t have allowed her to live with you on your income and under your controlling rules. YTA", "Bruh. I\u2019d cook if my AC was on 76.", "YTA not only for being controlling. But for thinking that 76 is an appropriate temperature. \n\nThere\u2019s a middle ground between the two. It\u2019s called a compromise. It\u2019s something that mature adults in relationships do when they disagree with something. It takes some communication, but based on this you will need to learn how to communicate too", "YTA because if she\u2019s running around doing housework and working up a sweat, she may need to blast that thing.  Also, this is petty and controlling.  Why are you nickel-and-diming your wife\u2019s comfort in her own home?", "YTA. 76 is extremely uncomfortable for most people. Why not try a compromise, like 68?", "YTA. Your wife is an adult and is entitled to be comfortable in her own home. You don\u2019t need to control the temperature when you aren\u2019t even there.

And she's right, you're also not home. \n\n76F (or as the rest of the world would call it, 24C) is warm and above \"room temperature\". My stepmother and father fight about this all the time is and my stepmom is absolutely miserable at anything over 22C. 60F (15C) is STUPIDLY cold for a room and also unreasonable. \n\nSounds like you both need to grow up and learn how to compromise.

I live in an older house, and 74 degrees feels more like 80 degrees.", "YTA for locking her out of it however it sounds like your wife doesn\u2019t understand how thermostats work and might be worth going through it (like explaining if it\u2019s 76\u00b0 in your house and you turn the thermostat down it\u2019s not going to blow colder air if you set it to 60\u00b0 versus setting it to 68\u00b0). If she\u2019s shutting it off then it\u2019s not making it to 60\u00b0 so her preferred temp might be more like 68\u00b0.

We lived together in an apartment before getting married and now we live in a house I inherited from my grandmother.\n\nThis summer has been quite hot and so like most people, we have been running our air conditioner nearly around the clock. My wife and I have very different ideas of how we should run it though. Using energy saver recommendations, I like to keep it at around 76 Fahrenheit and on low. My wife likes to turn it down to 60 degrees and blast it on the highest setting, then turn it off when she gets cold, then turn it back on again when she gets hot.\n\nI've tried discussing this with her but there's literally nothing I can do or say to convince her. She currently stays at home taking care of the house while I go to work, and the second I'm out the door, the thermostat is messed with. I've tried showing her our exorbitantly expensive power bill (from May of all months so it was only going to go up) but she doesn't care. She says that she's at home all day and so she should have control over it.\n\nWe've argued about this on and off since. About three weeks ago I got a reservation for a new digital thermostat installation. The guys finally came in a few days ago and installed a new smart thermostat off our older air conditioning unit. The first thing I did was password protect it so you would need a PIN to change any of the settings. \n\nMy wife came home a few hours after I had set the PIN and noticed the new unit. When she tried to change the settings she was met with a request for a PIN, and she asked me what it was. I told her that I wouldn't be telling her that. Then she asked what she should do if she gets hot. I responded that she can still turn the air conditioning on and off without the PIN. \n\nThe next morning I left for work as normal, setting it to 76. When I got home in the afternoon I found my wife on the living room floor pantomiming a fainting spell. She mustered the energy to say \"Help ... water ...\" I ignored her because you faint from heat in a climate-controlled room. When she realized I wouldn't give her attention she exploded in anger and yelled that she could have died, prompting another argument. She ended it with calling me \"controlling\" and hasn't said more than a word to me since.\n\nThings have been rough for the past couple of days.

You both seem incredibly stubborn and unwilling to compromise or communicate like adults. If this is how you\u2019re dealing with conflict now\u2026it\u2019s gonna be a rough 5-10 years of resentful marriage before the messy divorce. Hopefully you don\u2019t end up having kids to drag through the hell with you.", "So she gets no say into household decisions at all?", "Since she doesn\u2019t pay the bill she has no say in the house? When she spends more time at home than you? 76 degrees is very uncomfortable to live in.", "Just because your wife makes no money doesn\u2019t make you better than her. Since you seem to think that, and pat yourself on the back. Her comfort is just as important, no one cares that you make money.

I hate the heat. I whine in the heat. I complain all summer. I'm just the worst when it is hot out and I am too hot. But I try not to use too much power when it's going to be a high use day. I live in a very major city in the US.", "It can depend on the AC unit, the house insulation and a number of other factors, so it\u2019s not unexpected that this might change. I travel a lot and will set hotel room temperatures between 20-25c based on what is most comfortable in that place. 60F is 15C, which is stupidly cold.", ">To stay comfortable and save money this summer, the U.S. Department of Energy recommends setting your thermostat to 78\u00b0F (26\u00b0C) when you are home. Setting your air conditioner to this level will allow you to stay cool and avoid an unusually high electricity bill.\n\nWe also have several fans she can use and a swimming pool. Much of my work is done outdoors so when I come home covered in sweat to a woman pretending to be suffering from heatstroke, I just can't deal with it.", "Actually OP made a comment stating that he mostly works outdoors. He also states in the original he tried talking to her numerous times. She's not even trying to compromise. Turning it down to 60 until it's cold, turning it off until it's hot and back on again takes a lot more energy to cool it thus costing a lot more money.  Maybe if 76 is not cool enough for her she could try 74 but 60 is ridiculous for the money. I am naturally very hot natured and hate summer.  Prefer Temps in the low 60s or  less. But I would never run my AC that low as we can't afford the bills. She seems to me to be unreasonable in her thinking here.\n\nNow I also think his way of handling it is a bit overboard. \n\nI don't know the correct way to say it but they are both wrong in my opinion.", "because that\u2019s just not normal to be overheating at 76* gotta do some cardio or something\u2026", "Yeah I agree they\u2019re both crazy.

Maybe you should try not being an asshole and stop assuming stupid shit.", "What an ignorant comment. I\u2019ve NEVER found anyone who finds 76 to be a comfortable temp, out of any house I\u2019ve been in. Most people keep their house between 68-72.

They seem very immature on the matter honestly.", "Well op did say his compromise was to set it at a number in between but she refuses to go over 60 the wife is the problem imo", "Overall from OPs comments I\u2019m not sure this dynamic is working for them and they probably need to talk more about them then temperatures", "Biology is fatphobic.
