We lived together in an apartment before getting married and now we live in a house I inherited from my grandmother.\n\nThis summer has been quite hot and so like most people, we have been running our air conditioner nearly around the clock. My wife and I have very different ideas of how we should run it though. Using energy saver recommendations, I like to keep it at around 76 Fahrenheit and on low. My wife likes to turn it down to 60 degrees and blast it on the highest setting, then turn it off when she gets cold, then turn it back on again when she gets hot.\n\nI've tried discussing this with her but there's literally nothing I can do or say to convince her. She currently stays at home taking care of the house while I go to work, and the second I'm out the door, the thermostat is messed with. I've tried showing her our exorbitantly expensive power bill (from May of all months so it was only going to go up) but she doesn't care. She says that she's at home all day and so she should have control over it.\n\nWe've argued about this on and off since. About three weeks ago I got a reservation for a new digital thermostat installation. The guys finally came in a few days ago and installed a new smart thermostat off our older air conditioning unit. The first thing I did was password protect it so you would need a PIN to change any of the settings. \n\nMy wife came home a few hours after I had set the PIN and noticed the new unit. When she tried to change the settings she was met with a request for a PIN, and she asked me what it was. I told her that I wouldn't be telling her that. Then she asked what she should do if she gets hot. I responded that she can still turn the air conditioning on and off without the PIN. \n\nThe next morning I left for work as normal, setting it to 76. When I got home in the afternoon I found my wife on the living room floor pantomiming a fainting spell. She mustered the energy to say \"Help ... water ...\" I ignored her because you faint from heat in a climate-controlled room. When she realized I wouldn't give her attention she exploded in anger and yelled that she could have died, prompting another argument. She ended it with calling me \"controlling\" and hasn't said more than a word to me since.\n\nThings have been rough for the past couple of days.

On the other hand, I'd be very uncomfortable at a 76 degree set a/c.  I wouldn't be dying mind you but uncomfortable...she wants to blast it at 60 and that's causing your bill to be extremely high.  You tried talking to her about it but she just disregarded it then you did get controlling and got the system with the pin.  I think you both are being jerks to be honest..... why not try a compromise and try setting it to 72 and see if that's a bit more comfortable for her?  Personally 68 is my comfort zone", "ESH - She is being unreasonable.  I agree that setting the thermostat at 60 and turning it on and off repeatedly is wasteful and will cause a lot of unnecessary wear and tear to the A/C unit.  That said, doing this behind her back is essentially treating her like a child. ( Yes, she is acting like a child, but you can't actually treat her like one, because that's an unhealthy relationship dynamic.)\n\nYou guys need couple's counseling to help you figure out if there is something bigger at play that is causing her to latch onto this A/C issue as a form of control in your relationship.  Or maybe she is always unreasonable, and you need to figure out if you can live with that and how to deal with her behavior without being unreasonably controlling yourself.", "YTA. It's not just your hours and just your thermostat. You're going to have to reach a *compromise* like adults. She's not your child. And no person under 90 years old keeps the AC at 76. Where do you go to work? If it's indoors, I guarantee it's not 76 degrees in there. Sounds like she's the one at home during the heat of the day. Why don't you talk to her about keeping on 72 or something and seeing how that goes.", "YTA. You tried to have a conversation, and when you couldn\u2019t convince her, you just put in a new thermostat that only you could control. Good job coming to a compromise with your spouse. \n\nAnd then the kicker is that you aren\u2019t even there. So you decide what should be comfortable for her.  Which so happens to be EXACTLY what YOU want. \n\nYou give her zero consideration and zero input. What she wants has no impact on your decision. You don\u2019t adjust it by a single degree. That is pretty much the definition of controlling. \n\nHow do you convince yourself that you aren\u2019t the asshole?", "You're both freaking childish\n\n\nESH", "YTA.

You ARE controlling. You are literally controlling the fucking temperature she can have. Holy shit, dude.", "YTA 76 is not comfortable for most people. Yes the electric company recommends a higher temperature because they don't care about your comfort.

You don't have any right to deny her access to anything in her own house.\n\nThe only thing you have any right to do is come to some kind of mutual agreement.\n\nIf it is impossible to come to a mutual agreement then tough shit. That's life too. You still don't have any right to deny her access to anything in her own home. You can divorce her if you want if the thermostat is that important to you.\n\nFor what it's worth I had a roommate put a lockbox over a thermostat in the summer because they didn't like paying their 1/4 share of the bill so I smashed it with a hammer.\n\nI had another roommate in the same situation shut off the breaker for the AC, put a cheap lock on the breaker box, and lie to everyone else in the house saying that the AC was broken, after they had complained about their 1/4 of the bill and lost a house vote on the matter. Then keep \"forgetting\" to call the landlord to get it fixed, so I found the breaker box, broke the cheap lock off, flipped the breaker, and put an expensive lock on them told everyone I had miraculously fixed the AC.\n\nIf I was OPs wife I'd be smashing his new thermostat with a hammer and he'd be paying for that too.\n\nThat being said I don't know what's wrong with her either.

It\u2019s called a compromise. It\u2019s something that mature adults in relationships do when they disagree with something. It takes some communication, but based on this you will need to learn how to communicate too", "YTA because if she\u2019s running around doing housework and working up a sweat, she may need to blast that thing.  Also, this is petty and controlling.  Why are you nickel-and-diming your wife\u2019s comfort in her own home?", "YTA. 76 is extremely uncomfortable for most people.

My stepmother and father fight about this all the time is and my stepmom is absolutely miserable at anything over 22C. 60F (15C) is STUPIDLY cold for a room and also unreasonable. \n\nSounds like you both need to grow up and learn how to compromise.

With the temperature at 76 vacuum your whole house. Scrub the bathroom. Mop the floors.

If she\u2019s shutting it off then it\u2019s not making it to 60\u00b0 so her preferred temp might be more like 68\u00b0.

So if you're in a room with a wall unit set to 23, the air coming out may be closer to 18 until the room actually cools down. And since the rooms around you aren't being cooled, the cool air dissipates faster, and the AC kicks back into cooling mode frequently. By contrast in the US, it's more common to have an external AC unit which cools an entire floor of the house. I think they typically reach the target temperature a bit faster, and don't blow cold air as long. So 23 is reached very quickly, and it stays there without blowing very cold air periodically, because all the rooms are being cooled uniformly, not just the one where the wall unit is, so it doesn't feel like as much of a relief. At least this is my theory - I grew up in FL and our default power saving temperature was 78 (24), which felt stifling.

I\u2019ll bet those in warmer climates turn the heating up sooner in the winter than those of us in the north.", "I can tell these people aren\u2019t from Texas because I keep mine at 78\u00b0 and it\u2019s lovely in here \ud83d\ude02", "My teachers actually did this back in high school, our air was always set to the lowest setting with a locked box around it. The teachers would take a rag, run it under hot water, ring it out and put it on top of the box. It tricked the sensor every time", "Hence why, at the end of my comment, I said \u201cESH, they should find a compromise\u201d. 76 is too hot and 60 is not just too cold but is also a huge waste of power.", "I was beginning to believe I was the only one that got randomly nauseous over the heat. Thank goodness I\u2019m not.", "While I agree they are both ridiculous I live in South Florida and rarely set the AC below 73. I run hot in general but also wear tank tops/short shorts when hanging around the house. OPs spouse is being dramatic and he\u2019s being controlling but setting the AC below 70 is a bit extreme. \n\nAlso, I have ceiling and independent fans in major living areas so that may be why we never need to go below 73. I know some newer homes don\u2019t even install fans so if that\u2019s what they\u2019re dealing with I guess I can slightly understand more.", "In the office portion of where I worked for years (I was in the shop area) they had to put lock boxes on the t-stats. People in the common office area would turn the t-stat way down and freeze the people in the small office rooms."]}
