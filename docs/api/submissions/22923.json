We lived together in an apartment before getting married and now we live in a house I inherited from my grandmother.\n\nThis summer has been quite hot and so like most people, we have been running our air conditioner nearly around the clock. My wife and I have very different ideas of how we should run it though. Using energy saver recommendations, I like to keep it at around 76 Fahrenheit and on low. My wife likes to turn it down to 60 degrees and blast it on the highest setting, then turn it off when she gets cold, then turn it back on again when she gets hot.\n\nI've tried discussing this with her but there's literally nothing I can do or say to convince her. She currently stays at home taking care of the house while I go to work, and the second I'm out the door, the thermostat is messed with. I've tried showing her our exorbitantly expensive power bill (from May of all months so it was only going to go up) but she doesn't care. She says that she's at home all day and so she should have control over it.\n\nWe've argued about this on and off since. About three weeks ago I got a reservation for a new digital thermostat installation. The guys finally came in a few days ago and installed a new smart thermostat off our older air conditioning unit. The first thing I did was password protect it so you would need a PIN to change any of the settings. \n\nMy wife came home a few hours after I had set the PIN and noticed the new unit. When she tried to change the settings she was met with a request for a PIN, and she asked me what it was. I told her that I wouldn't be telling her that. Then she asked what she should do if she gets hot. I responded that she can still turn the air conditioning on and off without the PIN. \n\nThe next morning I left for work as normal, setting it to 76. When I got home in the afternoon I found my wife on the living room floor pantomiming a fainting spell. She mustered the energy to say \"Help ... water ...\" I ignored her because you faint from heat in a climate-controlled room. When she realized I wouldn't give her attention she exploded in anger and yelled that she could have died, prompting another argument. She ended it with calling me \"controlling\" and hasn't said more than a word to me since.\n\nThings have been rough for the past couple of days.

On the other hand, I'd be very uncomfortable at a 76 degree set a/c.  I wouldn't be dying mind you but uncomfortable...she wants to blast it at 60 and that's causing your bill to be extremely high.  You tried talking to her about it but she just disregarded it then you did get controlling and got the system with the pin.  I think you both are being jerks to be honest..... why not try a compromise and try setting it to 72 and see if that's a bit more comfortable for her?  Personally 68 is my comfort zone", "ESH - She is being unreasonable.  I agree that setting the thermostat at 60 and turning it on and off repeatedly is wasteful and will cause a lot of unnecessary wear and tear to the A/C unit.  That said, doing this behind her back is essentially treating her like a child. ( Yes, she is acting like a child, but you can't actually treat her like one, because that's an unhealthy relationship dynamic.)\n\nYou guys need couple's counseling to help you figure out if there is something bigger at play that is causing her to latch onto this A/C issue as a form of control in your relationship.  Or maybe she is always unreasonable, and you need to figure out if you can live with that and how to deal with her behavior without being unreasonably controlling yourself.", "YTA. It's not just your hours and just your thermostat. You're going to have to reach a *compromise* like adults. She's not your child. And no person under 90 years old keeps the AC at 76. Where do you go to work? If it's indoors, I guarantee it's not 76 degrees in there. Sounds like she's the one at home during the heat of the day. Why don't you talk to her about keeping on 72 or something and seeing how that goes.", "YTA. You tried to have a conversation, and when you couldn\u2019t convince her, you just put in a new thermostat that only you could control. Good job coming to a compromise with your spouse. \n\nAnd then the kicker is that you aren\u2019t even there. So you decide what should be comfortable for her.  Which so happens to be EXACTLY what YOU want. \n\nYou give her zero consideration and zero input. What she wants has no impact on your decision. You don\u2019t adjust it by a single degree. That is pretty much the definition of controlling. \n\nHow do you convince yourself that you aren\u2019t the asshole?", "You're both freaking childish\n\n\nESH", "YTA.

You ARE controlling. You are literally controlling the fucking temperature she can have. Holy shit, dude.", "YTA 76 is not comfortable for most people. Yes the electric company recommends a higher temperature because they don't care about your comfort.

You don't have any right to deny her access to anything in her own house.\n\nThe only thing you have any right to do is come to some kind of mutual agreement.\n\nIf it is impossible to come to a mutual agreement then tough shit. That's life too. You still don't have any right to deny her access to anything in her own home. You can divorce her if you want if the thermostat is that important to you.\n\nFor what it's worth I had a roommate put a lockbox over a thermostat in the summer because they didn't like paying their 1/4 share of the bill so I smashed it with a hammer.\n\nI had another roommate in the same situation shut off the breaker for the AC, put a cheap lock on the breaker box, and lie to everyone else in the house saying that the AC was broken, after they had complained about their 1/4 of the bill and lost a house vote on the matter. Then keep \"forgetting\" to call the landlord to get it fixed, so I found the breaker box, broke the cheap lock off, flipped the breaker, and put an expensive lock on them told everyone I had miraculously fixed the AC.\n\nIf I was OPs wife I'd be smashing his new thermostat with a hammer and he'd be paying for that too.\n\nThat being said I don't know what's wrong with her either.

It\u2019s called a compromise. It\u2019s something that mature adults in relationships do when they disagree with something. It takes some communication, but based on this you will need to learn how to communicate too", "YTA because if she\u2019s running around doing housework and working up a sweat, she may need to blast that thing.  Also, this is petty and controlling.  Why are you nickel-and-diming your wife\u2019s comfort in her own home?", "YTA. 76 is extremely uncomfortable for most people.

And she's right, you're also not home. \n\n76F (or as the rest of the world would call it, 24C) is warm and above \"room temperature\". My stepmother and father fight about this all the time is and my stepmom is absolutely miserable at anything over 22C. 60F (15C) is STUPIDLY cold for a room and also unreasonable. \n\nSounds like you both need to grow up and learn how to compromise.

With the temperature at 76 vacuum your whole house. Scrub the bathroom. Mop the floors.

If she\u2019s shutting it off then it\u2019s not making it to 60\u00b0 so her preferred temp might be more like 68\u00b0.

I'll give Texas a few degrees hotter average summers, and a little more humidity, but not hugely different. \n\nI'll stand with 76 is comfortable (when it's 95 and humid outside), and you're wearing shorts and a loose singlet top.", "Heat stroke is actually treated by rapidly cooling the person down.", "Exactly this. I have hormone and thyroid issues and am always so insanely hot. Even in the winter when everyone has their fireplaces and heat running, I have to crack a window and run a fan just to exist comfortably. I'm also on an unrelated medication that messes with the way bodies regulate their temperature and there are warnings about monitoring the heat as it makes us more likely to have a heat stroke. \n\nNot only that, but in humid climates, typically the thermostat has to be a little lower to properly dispel the humidity otherwise it stays muggy inside, too. We keep it at between 70-72 in our house and have a handful of fans running. Electricity during the summer is our biggest expense, but it's one we budget for because it's basically a medical necessity. I'm not going to be miserable and feel like shit in my own house.", "While we are at it, fuck SoCal Edison who continues to push 78\u00b0 all while catching half our state on fire every couple years with their shit infrastructure and having us tax payers footing the bill.", "What is ACTUALLY unacceptable behavior is being controlling, which is what OP did. Forcing her to be at a temperature that makes her uncomfortable and not giving her access to change that, is absolutely controlling and abusive.", "Yeah, it depends on the person. 76\u00b0 would be intolerable unless the humidity was really low. Even sitting fully nude in front of a big fan on full blast, I\u2019d be drenched in sweat all day.", "Yes that's correct. But in extreme cases people can get a heat stroke if the body doesn't start perspiring and begin cooling off in hot weather. And this is for the summer where the temps can cross 122\u00b0 F(50\u00b0 C) in the shade( it's an extreme example and a rare case, but that is the justification they give and have heard growing up).", "Both are unacceptable, hence ESH.", "76, 78 both are too hot for indoors. Get a grip dude", "You literally just talked about 78. Cotext clues are very challenging.", "It's not going to be outrageous at 70 degrees.", "OP's wife refuses to run it at 70\u00b0, despite many discussions. She insists on running it at 60. It's all right there in the story"]}
