I can\u2019t really see what was wrong about what I said. Am I the asshole?\nUPDATE: about an hour after I made this post, Layla called me. And what she said hit me like herd of bison. She called and apologized for blowing up on me and said all she wanted was to live out one of her fantasies. After she said this I thought back to some of the comments on this post and thought \u201cthere\u2019s no way that they were right!?\u201d Low and behold she had actually invited 3 guys other than me all over the age of 30. She told me her plan was to have get to know each other, then at the end of the night, have us run a train on her. I was caught so off guard I hung up the phone. After about 10 mins she called back yelling and told me I ruined that for her and that\u2019s why she was so upset. she is now blocked and I\u2019m so glad I didn\u2019t go to the fireworks.
