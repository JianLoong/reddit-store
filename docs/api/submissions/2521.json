At my old place someone attempted to rob me twice. It was in the dead of night both times. The only reason nothing happened was because of my dog scaring them off. His barking is not incessant.

If I tell him to stop, he stops. At 2a.m I cannot do anything beside sit by the door and hope they just drop it at some point. The only reason the kids left was because one of the neighbours came out. They stuck around, to my vague memory for a solid 20minutes. That\u2019s freaking insane. What if in a few months my place gets broken into and the dog is either crated or taught to keep quiet? I am female and I live alone, I am not taking those chances. \n\nI already got a few nice suggestions on what to do -police report, camera at the front door.
