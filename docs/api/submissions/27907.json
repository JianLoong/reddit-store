It was downright *generous* of you to laugh, because then he would have been able to pass it off as a joke. The alternative would have been taking his audacious request at face value, which would mean accepting instantly and without reservation that your brother is capable of staggering foolishness. If you were able to accept it that quickly and easily, then you would be admitting that your opinion of him is very low indeed.\n\nToo bad he didn't take you up on the opportunity you gave him to exit the conversation with at least some dignity intact.", "Tbf tiramisu is usually a one person dessert.

She was INCREDIBLY immature. She didn't exactly set the mood for maturity.\n\nReally, laughing is quite a kind thing for OP to do-- because OP was generously assuming that their brother was making a stupid joke.

I do think OP attacking wrong person here except SIL doesn't get her own tirasmui unless her husband gets it\n\nBut I get why OP feels agrieved. Oh you know that cake, the one you got especially for my son. The one my wife ate. Well she really liked it. Could you get her another? OP isn't the tirasmui fairy esp for someone who ate her own son's treat.", "My mistake - completely misread that.", "Wow! Totally misread that - thank you for correcting!!", "I agree though if been kid, your approach would have been the right one. I just hope he did get some replacement b'day treat."]}
