It was downright *generous* of you to laugh, because then he would have been able to pass it off as a joke. The alternative would have been taking his audacious request at face value, which would mean accepting instantly and without reservation that your brother is capable of staggering foolishness. If you were able to accept it that quickly and easily, then you would be admitting that your opinion of him is very low indeed.\n\nToo bad he didn't take you up on the opportunity you gave him to exit the conversation with at least some dignity intact.", "Tbf tiramisu is usually a one person dessert. But still dick move to eat her own son's birthday treat.", "I\u2019m picturing a 3 year old with a party hat and tiramisu \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "11", "Why is OP obligated to remain a paragon of maturity when SIL literally couldn't even stop herself from eating *her own son's* birthday treat? She was INCREDIBLY immature. She didn't exactly set the mood for maturity.\n\nReally, laughing is quite a kind thing for OP to do-- because OP was generously assuming that their brother was making a stupid joke. The alternative, taking the request seriously, would have implied that they thought their brother to be so absolutely brazen that he would make THAT audacious a request in actual seriousness.\n\nWhich is more polite-- to assume that your brother is joking, or to assume that your brother is acting horribly?", "Agreed...", "A little YTA - I totally understand why a grown man asking you do get his own spouse\u2019s birthday \u201ccake\u201d when he could get it himself, especially after she ate her son\u2019s, would provoke that response but maybe he thought you could grab it on the way or he was busy? Still a little rude but I get why you did\u2026\nEdited because reading comprehension wasn\u2019t my strong suit today\u2026", "My brother was the one who asked me to help, not my nephew. I laughed at my brother, not my nephew. My brother\u2019s salary is higher than mine so if I can afford it he can.", "It was brother who asked not nephew. And he has a wife and son of 11, I am hoping he could work out how to buy one for his wife. I do think OP attacking wrong person here except SIL doesn't get her own tirasmui unless her husband gets it\n\nBut I get why OP feels agrieved. Oh you know that cake, the one you got especially for my son. The one my wife ate. Well she really liked it. Could you get her another? OP isn't the tirasmui fairy esp for someone who ate her own son's treat.", "My mistake - completely misread that.", "Wow! Totally misread that - thank you for correcting!!", "I agree though if been kid, your approach would have been the right one. I just hope he did get some replacement b'day treat.", "NTA. I\u2019d be tempted to buy another and present it to nephew in front of both his parents and make a sarky comment about celebrating others\u2019 birthdays\u2026", "HE wants one for his wife, HE should buy it!", "INFO: You got him just a slice or was this a cake that could be sliced up. What was your Nephew's reaction and is this a common occurrence between the Mom and him? What was your brother's Reaction and how did your brothers ask you\" Hey SIL loved the cake, for her birthday next week can you get her that cake for a gift?\".", "I mean, NTA, but perhaps a skosh overdramatic about tiramisu lmao.  I mean that shit IS delicious, though,  and the SIL eating it was kind of a shitty move.  \n\nHowever, if it was my 11 year old, and it was a situation where she was too full to eat it after dinner and put it in the fridge, i absolutely would've eaten it because once she puts leftover food in the fridge, it's gonna be in there til it goes bad.", "NTA\n\nShe already had hers. But you could send her a reminder of where the bakery is so she can buy one for herself.", "NTA - she already had her birthday tiramisu - she stole it from her son. There is no need to buy her another one.", "NTA. The audacity! She stole her son's tiramisu and your brother actually expected you yo go buy one for her birthday. He deserved that laughter.", "NTA", "Exactly.  laughing in his face would have been the most 'civil' thing I would have done.\n\nNTA.", "How is that petty? OP went above and beyond. She isn\u2019t required to buy whatever anyone wants on demand.", "Just a slice. He was quite upset about it. Her eating his snacks isn't a common occurrence.\n\nMy brother just said it was no big deal, told me she liked the cake and asked me to buy it.", "Seriously, if someone got my 11 year old daughter a piece of coffee flavored cake, she'd probably say the same thing \"ill eat this after dinner\" then would give it to someone who wanted it.  This whole post lacks so much info, yet everyones like HOW DARE SIL EAT HIS BIRTHDAY PRESENT BEFORE HE COULD!  Like lol wheres it even say that, it says \"my nephew said he'd eat it after dinner\", then that SIL ate it instead.  People are making assumptions and framing the SIL as some kinda monster when no one has any idea what happened lmao.  I'd be willing to wager OP isnt a fan of SIL to begin with, hence the very obvious lack of detail in the post.\n\n...also who gets tiramisu for an 11 year olds birthday present?  Is the kid an avid fan of tiramisu?  Had he ever even had it before? Who fuckin knows, but SIL is obviously a monster lol\n\nThe whole thing seems a bit over the top lol", "Also, i figured since it was just for him, it was probably a single slice.  Either that or, the nephew planned to eat an entire tiramisu cake after dinner but the evil SIL got to it first and ate the entire thing herself.  Lol.  Silly", "This isn't being dramatic at all. The nephew was planning on eating it after dinner -- totally normal to save cake for after dinner -- but the SIL ate it instead. OP got their nephew a gift and it was stolen from him. Literally, it was his birthday cake. Just because something is delicious doesn't justify taking it for yourself. \n\nOP rightfully pointed out that SIL already got tiramisu and then told their brother where to get more. They aren't obligated to purchase another one for the SIL's birthday and they don't need to pretend like it was okay that the SIL took the birthday present.", "Depends, e.g. supermarkets sell little cup ones or entire trays. The entire tray would be excessive", "OP laughing at brothers request was petty. The pettiness was valid and completely understandable (I would\u2019ve probably laughed too) because SIL was acting selfish/greedy.", "My nephew loves tiramisu and was looking forward to eating it.", "It's a one serving dessert in a little bowl. Of course he'd have eaten it all.", "That's Sil's age, right?", "Op said nephew \"said hed eat it after dinner\".  You have no idea what happened during the time between then and when SIL ate it. Just seems like making mountains out of mole hills, in my opinion.  What if the nephew didn't like tiramisu but didnt want to hurt OP's feelings?  \n\nYou're makin the SIL seem like a damn monster cause she ate a piece of tiramisu lmao.  And I said NTA.  What else you want from me?  Just seems like a bit much to be makin such a big deal about it.", "This just reminded me of my grandma getting stoned off her ass and eating an entire Costco cake (like this: https://images.app.goo.gl/wFE26ZTo8bXjbbsi7) I'd bought for the family while everyone was sleeping."]}
