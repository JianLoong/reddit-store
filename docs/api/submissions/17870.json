I do this in addition to online classes & sub on my \"days off\". The family doesn't pay well, I work about 25 hours during the school year ($300/week) & 40-50 in the summer (\\~$500/week), but they feed me & are flexible with my schedule.\n\nOne of the things I love to do for the kids is to take them to the local library. Usually, I take them on a Monday & return them on Friday, however, last month was a little different. There was an event at the library that the kids wanted to go to, but on that Friday I was leaving for vacation for 2 weeks & wouldn't be able to return the books.\n\nI asked the mom if she would be able to return them for me & she assured me she would if the kids decided to check out. Just to be sure, the day of I asked again & she said, \"If it's going to be a thing, just don't let them check anything out\" but said the kids love \"renting\" from the library & really look forward to it, so she understood if telling them \"no\" wasn't an option.\n\nI should've taken that as a sign, but against my better judgment, I let them pick out a few things...on my card as the kids don't have library cards of their own.\n\nWell, last week I tried checking something out for myself & was alerted that I owed almost $70 in fines for the materials the kids got. I IMMEDIATELY called the mom & asked about it. She brushed me off, downplaying the ordeal. Giving me some excuse about how it slipped her mind.\n\nThe next morning at work, I found the items mixed in with the kids' things & the kids were under the impression that the library items were theirs to keep. When mom got home, I asked her for the money to pay the fines & she FLIPPED OUT on me. Told me it was my fault, she didn't want me to check out to begin with, I should've returned the items on my own. She said she pays me well enough & I am just making a big deal out of nothing.\n\nHowever, I don't have $70 to spare. I'd saved up for months for this vacation & am barely scraping by. She pays me so little to watch her kids & I know I could nanny for another family making double if I wanted to. \n\nI reminded her that I don't just watch the kids, I cook & clean as well for a little more than $10hr. I told her that she's not even paying me the $15hr we had agreed on. She got even more upset & said \"she basically is, the rest of the money is like tax & food fees\". I was floored. When the husband got home, his compromise was to either take the money out of my next paycheck or drop me down to $10hr until the fee was paid off.\n\nI don't think that's fair at all. I complained to some friends about the situation & I'm getting mixed reviews. Some say that I should have had a contract or something to protect me & this is a learning experience. Others are saying the parents are taking advantage of me & I should leave, & some are saying I'm the AH because it's on my card & this is my mistake.

Legally, you are responsible for any fees incurred on your library card.\n\nNTA. I agree with the people who said you should've gotten the parents to sign a contract *and* the ones who say they're taking advantage of you. As much as it will hurt you as well as the children because a bond has developed among you, I think it may be time to get a nanny job with a different family.\n\nWrite up a simple contract expressing how much you expect to get paid per hour, the fact that you like to go to the library with the kids, etc. Lay it all out. There may be contract templates online for childcare/nanny specific things, so look around. All you would have to do is print up a couple of copies and fill in the blanks. Keep one copy for your records and give the family the other copy. Keep an extra blank copy or two on hand so you can have it ready in case you need to go to a new family in the future. Good luck.", "NTA.\n\nThis is a learning experience in how to identify when you're being exploited.\n\nYou're right. The first clue she was not taking the items back was her offhand comment. The family should pay the fees, but they're not going to. Go to the library and see if they'll work with you. Explain what happened, including that she used your card for her children's items. She should have gotten and used her own card, honestly.\n\nThen, polish your resume and find another job.

There are multiple red flags here that these people are selfish and taking advantage of you.\n\n>the kids were under the impression that the library items were theirs to keep\n\nYou sound to have been taking them to the library regularly. You wouldn't have given them this impression and have surely explained how libraries work. If this impression came from anyone, it came from their parents.\n\n>she basically is, the rest of the money is like tax & food fees\n\nTaxes. If she's withholding taxes, she'd better have proof that the taxes are being submitted to the government properly.\n\n\"food fees\" aka board. Unless you agreed that meals would be provided in lieu of part of that $15, including what that amount would be, she should not be doing that. You could even argue that you did so... when you agreed to reduced your rate from the $20/hr you normally charge.\n\n>his compromise was to either take the money out of my next paycheck or drop me down to $10hr until the fee was paid off.\n\nWait... what? This does not compute. You're asking them to reimburse you for library overdue fees that they caused. His compromise does not sound like it does that at all. He should be adding money to your paycheck, not taking it away.\n\nThe **only** way I can make it make sense is if they agreed to front you that $70 as a loan, but are still trying to claim they have no fault in the items being overdue.\n\nWhich... they do. The mom agreed that if she let the kids check anything out, she would ensure that it was returned on time. A promise she failed to live up to.\n\nEven if they don't agree that they're 100% at fault, they should be agreeing that they're at least partially responsible and paying for at least half.\n\nThat they're not agreeing that they have any fault here, and seem generally interested on shorting you on $$ whereever they can find an excuse, stuff like this will probably keep happening if you stay with them.", "NTA. I hope you find another position quickly. These people can't afford a nanny.", "NTA:  But this is kinda on you.
