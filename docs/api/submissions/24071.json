Lana's bio father Jake and his family are not in the picture. Since she was 4 my partner Leo (42m) looked after her and raised her as his own. We do not have any children apart from Lana.\n\nNow the reason why Jake and his family are not in the picture is due to what happened between them and Lana in the past. To spare all the details, Jake and his father were found at taking not appropriate pictures of Lana when she was a baby and spreading them. That resulted in a court order against them, them serving the sentence and they can't have any contact with me, Lana or any of her future kids. They are also on the register for it. I understand how traumatic this might be to hear, so I haven't told Lana the whole truth waiting for her to be older.\n\nOver the past few weeks Lana have been behaving really weird. Usually she has great relationship with Leo, but suddenly she started picking on him and starting arguments. It came to a point where she ended up shouting at him for no reason over putting a knife covered in butter in a nearly empty jar of jam. Lana also said she wishes her real dad was here and she knows the whole truth and we are monsters for keeping them apart as her auntie (Jake's sister) told her everything.\n\nHere were I can be an asshole. My blood boiled and I snapped. I told her what really happened and showed her the entire case file against Jake and his family, including the registry and the articles from the newspapers. I couldn't stop until Leo took me back as Lana was mortified. She called me an asshole for \"dumping it all on her\" and went to her room. It has been a couple of days where she only comes out at night to eat (she has ensuite) and she took some time off from work too. I have tried talking to her and left a business card for a therapist if she needs help, but Lana wouldn't talk to me.\n\nEdit: some people are assuming I was screaming at my daughter. That was not the case, I have never raised my voice towards her. Leo had to intervene and separate us as I was having a full on anxiety attack and was crying while telling Lana all the information. I was angry at Jake's sister for going against the court order and contacting Lana and I was horrified what could have happened if Lana met her bio father or told them where we live. \n\nLana has no issues talking to Leo at the moment and she has apologised to him, but she is still pissed at me for not telling her about the entire situation sooner, while I would have preferred to do it later.", "created_utc": 1691396075, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15kec49/aita_for_telling_my_daughter_what_actually/", "score": 170, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm sure this was a shock and very traumatic for her, it's flipped the narrative she had in her head, and now she's blaming you, instead of her dad, as you're the one available and in the immediate, you're the one she sees as having done damage - you are not at fault and hopefully she will realize this. She does need a therapist. I'm not going to call someone an asshole for locking themselves in their room after finding out they were SA'd as a baby by their father, but you're certainly not an asshole either.\n\nI think both individual and family therapy would be available and I hope she realizes this and gets professional help to process it.", "NTA\n\nYou did what you had to protect your daughter.\n\nThe aunt was manipulating her, and it honestly baffles me how someone can stand by such atrocious people. While it definitely is traumatizing for your daughter, she's an adult and I'm sure she'll come around to figure out that you had her best interest at heart. \n\nI'd also suggest you look into therapy - but not right away. Give her some time to process it all, and then slowly ease her into the idea.", "NAH. She's old enough to know the truth, but this isn't the way to do it. But I understand your outburst. It must've been hella traumatic for you too.", "You're getting the anger because someone has to, and *she knows you're safe*. No matter what happens, you won't stop loving her. NTA.", "INFO: At what point were you planning to tell her the truth? And what did you tell her was the reason her dad was out of the picture?", "ESH. sure your daughter was being difficult and rude, but you getting back at her by trauma bombing something you had never even mentioned to her before seems cruel. her aunt\u2019s actions aside, you punished her for not knowing something you never told her and on top of that you did so by turning her entire world upside down. she\u2019s an asshole because she\u2019s still young, you\u2019re an asshole for negating 20 years of sheltering bc you were angry. it\u2019s understandable why you were frustrated but you should consider apologizing for the delivery imo", "NTA - she's old enough and it might not have been necessary if the aunt hadn't said anything but she did, so the truth had to come out. \n\nI guess it could've been done differently, but I understand you felt compelled to act and I just don't know that I could've done better in that situation.  I'm so sorry you've had to go through this.\n\nWell done for getting her out of that situation all those years ago.  You're very strong, and as someone else said she's blowing up on you because she knows it's safe to do so.  This is going to be really hard for her, so be patient. All you can do is be as supportive as possible while she comes to terms with this on her own.", "The only AH here is the woman who has been telling untruths to your daughter.  Try and speak to her mum to daughter.  Yes it was a whole heap of clusterf\\*ck that's just been dumped on her, but she shouldn't have had someone tell her lies.  Talk to her and give her a big hug OP.", "Holy shit! YTA. \n\nWhat you describe is horrifying. You protected your child from monsters for so long, only to rage throw it in her face. You didn't just tell her. You showed her the files, all while being angry. ANGRY! She was a victim of something horrifying, and you threw a massive tantrum and potentially fked her up even more. I am disgusted in you. Yes, she deserved to know, but not like this. Thank goodness you aren't my parent. I'd go NC with you.", "You spared \"all the details\" to the redditors in this post... You haven't toward the main victim. \nYou had 20 years to think about the right time and ways to share that very disturbing information and you do it when she has been violently misinformed about bio father, and go anger toward the actual father figure. You jumped a bit too quickly there imo and violently yourself. Over as tiny a detail as butter/jam crisis.\n\nYou acted undoubtedly very courageously when you faced a crime but that was your role. You should be proud. You are the good parent.\n\nNow you are the parent of the victim talking about the actual facts. I feel sorry for your daughter because she was 1st contacted by the aunt who served a biased story and when you received that, you delegated the main narrative to legal reports and journalists instead of a prepared caring discussion. You are on the aita sub, you know social media crasy contacts that can be made, DNA search etc... You could have seen that coming and you apparently retained and mismanaged to deal with the release of that cruel and scary facts before. YTA. \n\nI would say you are lucky if your daughter said it quickly via anger. She could have been 20 or 13 and remaining silent leaving the whole story to the other part.\n\nIf you do not use that therapist business card yourself, you would become a massive AH.\n\nEdit missing words", ">My blood boiled and I snapped.

It is not her fault she believed her aunt as she was never told the truth.", "YTA you dumped this on her because she wasn\u2019t treating your hubby how you wanted and because you are mad the aunt one upped you. Your daughter has absolutely a right to know but not in a fit of anger. A therapist should have been involved in this. Finding out your father and his family were predatory to you has got to be gut punch. Adopted kids and step kids go through phases of rejection instead of talking about it with her and telling her this long held secret in a delicate way you just dump it on her in the hopes that she starts seeing your husband differently again. Really absolutely no regard for her well being. \n\n\n\u201cI held this tragic dark secret from my daughter for YEARS out of concern for my daughters well being but then she was MEAN to my HUSBAND so I just dumped it all on her at once with no concern for her well being am I the asshole\u201d \n\n\nGet real of course you are", "YTA.\n\nIf you previously didn't think she was mature enough to know what happened to her, how can you blame her for acting immaturely when given incorrect information from someone she should have already had the maturity to question?\n\nMost 20 year olds know why they have a stepdad, know why their biological father isn't in their life, you left that blank for anyone to fill. Of course as a young adult at a time of intense identity exploration, she was going to be curious about the other half of her genetic identity.\n\nYou punished her with her trauma. Did you even talk to her about why she was acting that way to your husband before losing your shit on her?", "YTA. You can be right and still an asshole. You changed this whole girl\u2019s perception of life because you got mad? You had 20 years to plan how to tell this girl. That wasn\u2019t the way.", "\nYTA. You aren\u2019t wrong for telling her. You\u2019re wrong for *how* you told her. \n\nYou told her a heartbreaking truth in a moment of anger. You\u2019ve devastated that girl. You should have had a calm and considered discussion with her and given her the opportunity to ask questions. Instead, she heard this horrible information from an angry mother. \n\nDo you think she feels emotionally safe to talk to you about this now?", "YTA.\nLana did need to know this, and YWNBTA if you had talked to a therapist about the best way to tell her, and then followed those guidelines.\n\nBut let's get real, you were angry at her and you used her history as a weapon. I'm so sorry for this young woman for having two awful parents.", "I can't believe how many people think you aren't to be blamed in this situation. You keep this from her for nearly 20 years, which is understandable, but then you just lose it and decide to shout this life-altering, highly traumatizing information? Why? To defend the man in your life? Are you serious? And, have you wondered why she started treating this guy differently all of the sudden? Did something happen there? Had you talked to her about it?\n\nYTA.", "Yta - Lana is 20, you should\u2019ve told her a long time ago. Dumping it all on her in an argument was a horrible way of finally telling her.", "Honestly, YTA. By telling her absolutely nothing, you left the door wide open for people to manipulating her and telling \u201cthe truth\u201d first. A nice simple \u201cyour dad was caught doing bad things when you were a baby and that\u2019s why he\u2019s not allowed around you\u201d and then slowly expanding on that throughout the years to include more details in an age appropriate way.", "Nta, she was old enough to learn the truth. Was it the right setting? No, but she had the wrong picture of her father and Leo stepped up when it was necessary. He his ten times more a man than her father ever will be. Maybe talk to a family therapist that you have one Session to clear some stuff. If lana doesn't want Leo there, don't be angry, a mother daughter Session is okay, too.", "NAH. This is weirdly and scarily parallel to my life story (lana's). I have a unique perspective so here's my two cents: it is terrifying to be told this, about the pictures. It's demeaning and deeply uncomfortable. But I had to know. It's better to know the full story in a safe environment and sooner than later so you can work through it slowly and comfortably rather than being blindsided by it out of nowhere later in life. This is one of those situations where both routes will cause upheaval and pain, so I don't think anyone's the asshole but the one who did this to her.", "YTA. You should have had your daughter in therapy when she was much younger and told her the truth in a trauma informed compassionate manner. Did you think she wouldn\u2019t research her father etc when she became older? I am surprised it took until 20 years old honestly. You set her up for misinformation by lying to her for years and then because you didn\u2019t approve of how she was talking to your husband you destroyed her whole world while screaming at her. You should work with a therapist on how to repair the damage you caused.", "NTA she\u2019s 20 and she\u2019s having tantrums and blaming you when you\u2019ve done nothing wrong. You protected her from her dad and she\u2019s old enough now to understand that. If she wants to play the your not my real dad card then you can tell her what her real dad is actually like. The delivery wasn\u2019t great and I\u2019d try and have a calm conversation to her about it and explain your frustrations that you and Leo have always been trying to keep her safe and to throw it into her face about how her dad is better when he is a criminal was extremely upsetting", "No. She was acting like a brat because a vile in-law was poisoning her ear. She needed a reality [check.It](https://check.It) will cause some stress, though, maybe even depression - she LITERALLY just lost a father. Make sure she gets appropriate therapy.\n\nNTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I'll guess by the ensuite and being the only kid she's spoiled AF. Has she ever been faced with a problem that she needed to solve on her own, or did mommy and daddy always do it for her? Because if not, it's possible her way of facing problems is still that of a small child. She simply does not know what to do other than act out.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe NEEDED to be warned, since her dad and his family had made motions to reach out to her, and had started gaslighting her with their lies.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut it surely must be hard to process for her.

Your job is to protect your children to the best of your ability - it would seem you failed at this multiple times. No idea why your daughter having incorrect information on something you have kept from her for 20 years would make you angry at her? Or why you would lash out at her. Maybe it was time you told her but get a fucking therapist involved first - multiple sessions before you broach the subject and have a game plan rather than abusing her further.", "NTA, all the wannabe therapists (including your daughter) are out in force though to tell you how they would have perfectly therapeutically reacted to your daughter bullying your partner and allowing her disgusting aunt to turn her against him.", "NTA", "Just can't agree. OP did not tell her daughter with good intentions, she told her in an outburst of anger. This is something that needed to be handled delicately and a good parent would have discussed how and when to tell with a therapist, not trauma dumped on their kid in a way that was designed to hurt them. \nYTA OP", "Agreed on all counts (though I think I'd go ESH instead of NAH, given that they both acted badly). \n\nHer daughter's brattiness was not okay, but having got the answers she needed about why her daughter was acting like that, OP really needed to be able to keep her head and calmly tell her that she was the victim of a liar who was dripping poison in her ear, and why on Earth couldn't she have just asked about this instead of believing her aunt without question and deciding to act out against her family? And then at that point she could have explained matters with the care she had always been planning, and ask whether her daughter would like to see the case file/ask another trusted person who can attest that she's telling the truth.", "I mean, she *isn\u2019t* safe because she \u201csnapped\u201d in anger and used the daughter\u2019s own abuse (that she had previously deliberately sheltered her from) to hurt her. This was an incredibly cruel way to tell her something that should have been handled with extreme sensitivity and care.\n\nOP should apologise for acting in a moment of anger and fear, and try to repair the relationship with her daughter who is likely to be in overwhelming shock right now.", "This! Even if telling her is the right decision, delivery can make a world of difference. As a mother who went through the pain, fear, heartbreak etc. of dealing with the initial trauma, you should be able to empathize with what she\u2019s going through now.", "I haven't screamed at her. Nowhere in my post I said I was screaming.\n\nIt was more like unloading and telling her everything that happened, but I was also crying during it as it was painful to bring up and the thought of her believing the lies about me and Leo made it hurt more.", ">YTA you dumped this on her because she wasn\u2019t treating your hubby ~~how you wanted~~ how a decent person would.\n\nFuck right off for downplaying this.\n\n>Usually she has great relationship with Leo, but suddenly she started picking on him and starting arguments.

Often the way in which someone is told something traumatic happened to them can be the trauma (she won't remember the photographs, she'll remember being told about them).

But she used it as a weapon. She had a right to be angry. To be furious. At her ex, at the aunt, but she took it out on her kid."]}
