Around school she's gotten the reputation of going after people's boyfriends (which doesn't even make sense because she's a lesbian). One time, her and her friend got into a relationship-of-sorts, broke up, and there was the end of another friendship. I've seen her wearing unflattering outfits and changing her style just to fit in so she doesn't stand out, and it frustrates me so much.\n\nRecently, she lost another friend because her friend's boyfriend tried to make a move on her, and her friend blamed her. I found her in the bathroom crying, and so I tried to comfort her because she seemed really distraught. While she was crying, she started ranting about all her past friendships and asked me why she couldn't have lasting friendships. I told her what I considered to be the truth: that she was pretty enough to threaten most of her previous friends so they decided to bring her down instead.

I thought it would be best to tell her the truth, that way she wouldn't be shocked and confused if this happened again.

Sure, we don't know how OP said it; maybe delivery was an issue. We don't know either way. \n\nBut the quoted section seems like a statement of fact to me.

It's not her fault that some people are so shallow they cannot see her for anything other than her physical appearance.  It seems you can't either.  It seems you're one of them too.  Friends with different interests usually broaden each other's horizons, not lose the friendship.

Apart the insecure, envious and shitty friends. You  said what,  you think and probably are right about it, is at least responsible for her becoming a target.  The problem is you didn't explain it well enough, and she perceived it as an accusation against her, and for something that she just is and she has not control over it, and it is absolutely not something that she should be blamed for.  \n\nIt is sad that she was hurt so much that she comes in unflattering clothes. She should be thriving, and instead she is struggling. From your post, you come as you sympathise for her, and you know that she is not only a good looking person, but also a good person. \n\n Maybe you can approach her,  and if you have decent friends invite her to do something together and reaffirm your relationship.  If your school has a psychologist or you have a professor you trust, ask for their opinion and help.   \n   I think you should also talk to her again, apologise and emphasize how you much you are sorry and concerned because you realised how you messed up during your last conversation, and you said a different thing from what you actually meant.", "NAH.

She trusted you in a vulnerable moment and, while what you said was technically true, it wasn\u2019t what was needed at the time. She needs a good friend right now and you have that chance.

Loudly and proudly go to bat for her when you hear catty comments. You will inevitably get called a lesbian or whatever, but just ignore it and call them on their bullshit. You don't have to be her bestie, just be on her side.", "YTA\n\nI think this is a matter of good intentions, terrible execution. In an emotional moment like that, it's important to be careful with your phrasing. While you might not have meant it, you still put the blame on her. \n\nHad you started with pointing out other people acted from a place of insecurity, the blame would go to *them*, as it should. Insecurity can make people vicious and selfish, but this is not her fault.\n\nShe is not to blame for the unjustifiable actions of her former friends.

I remember seeing a blonde girl in my college class, this was 20 years ago before everybody had injections at 18 - her face was just SO beautiful but also she looked like a sex doll. Like, her features. \n\nAnyway. I remember being struck by her face and how pretty she was but also thinking holy shit she has to walk around with that face all day (she appeared to be a natural blonde). \n\nMy point is I understand what you're saying. I've also lived my life as a very attractive woman. \n\nI'd ask to speak with her again if I were you. I wouldn't take back *anything* you said but I would add a few things. \n\n\"Hey Girl, I'm sorry if what I said was hard for you to hear yesterday but it's the truth. I remember those awful things they said about you in middle school and it's for the same reason. *I think it must be really shitty for you, because it's such a double-edged sword.*\"\n\nAnd then just like... this is her life and she will always have this problem and she must be so fucking pretty - I can tell you - it's a serious fucking burden to have had people staring at me literally almost all the time. I have grown super accustomed to it and I try to conduct myself accordingly but it's true and it's ... well she's 17 and she will learn to get used to it. \n\nIt means men will prey on her so bad over the next ten years, all of them all ages even the skeevy ones all of them wanting naked pictures, few people being your friend for real reasons, etc.\n\nSo I'd just reach out even if she's avoiding you, and tell her that while you're sorry to break the news, you're *sorrier* about how it will impact her life because you recognize this isn't something she can change, you've basically just informed her she has a lifelong condition of pissing people off, being called a whore and being friendless. \n\nDo you realize that?\n\nSo like, some empathy for what she's going through as she figures this out in her head and tries to figure out what this means.

There are so many women with ingrained misogyny who see other women as their competition. They will always blame the woman for tempting the man even if the other woman has no interest in the man whatsoever it\u2019s still her fault.\n\nOp, I really think your heart was in the right place and you genuinely just misstepped.
