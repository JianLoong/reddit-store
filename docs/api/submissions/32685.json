Her looks are not the problem.\n\nThe real problem is that she seems to make friends with petty, insecure people who are threatened by her appearance.\n\nSeriously! The \"friends\" who accuse her of going after others' biyfriends, or the \"friend\" who nlamed her fir her bf hitting on her? This is all pure, unadulterated BS.  \n\nShe needs to find better friends.", "YTA. She is around toxic people that's the issue. You telling her that it's her looks IS blaming her. She can't change how she looks. What is she supposed to do about it? She shouldn't even have to change her looks for others either. If they are insecure, that is THEIR problem, not hers. You victim blamed her based on factors she can't and shouldn't have to change.

Being pretty have nothing to do with losing friends. YTA.", "YTA\n\nYou victim blamed her at a really vulnerable time. Why? It isn't her fault other girls are threatened by her. You even admit yourself she is nice.", "You can't help how you physically look. You can enhance/detract from what you want, but you can't help how you were physically born. It feels like you're shaming her because you think her looks are the reason why she's getting attention. Maybe that's true, but it doesn't allow you to comment on someone else's body. At all. Maybe instead of focusing on her physical looks, like everyone she's trying to not interact with, you can focus on how she is as a person. See her as a person, not just if she's pretty or not.", "You attacked her when it was the actions of other people that are at fault, what has this girl done besides have good genes and have been born?\n\nYTA", "This comments section is so interesting to me. \n\n>I told her what I considered to be the truth: that she was pretty enough to threaten most of her previous friends so they decided to bring her down instead.\n\nHow is this bullying or victim blaming? Sure, we don't know how OP said it; maybe delivery was an issue. We don't know either way. \n\nBut the quoted section seems like a statement of fact to me. She's pretty, her friends feel threatened, and they take it out on her. Seems VERY clear to me that OP is saying \"this is your friends' problem\". Can someone please point out the exact words where OP blames this girl?", "YTA. SO VERY YTA.  Her looks aren't to blame, crappy people are.  There is no world in which being pretty or being dressed any particular way is an excuse for OTHER PEOPLE'S ACTIONS.", "You phrased your sentiment to your classmate terribly.

It's not her fault that some people are so shallow they cannot see her for anything other than her physical appearance.  It seems you can't either.  It seems you're one of them too.  Friends with different interests usually broaden each other's horizons, not lose the friendship.  At that age my friends and I learned a lot from each other, different music, different art styles, different people due to extended friends of family.

Apart the insecure, envious and shitty friends. You  said what,  you think and probably are right about it, is at least responsible for her becoming a target.  The problem is you didn't explain it well enough, and she perceived it as an accusation against her, and for something that she just is and she has not control over it, and it is absolutely not something that she should be blamed for.  \n\nIt is sad that she was hurt so much that she comes in unflattering clothes. She should be thriving, and instead she is struggling. From your post, you come as you sympathise for her, and you know that she is not only a good looking person, but also a good person. \n\n Maybe you can approach her,  and if you have decent friends invite her to do something together and reaffirm your relationship.  If your school has a psychologist or you have a professor you trust, ask for their opinion and help.   \n   I think you should also talk to her again, apologise and emphasize how you much you are sorry and concerned because you realised how you messed up during your last conversation, and you said a different thing from what you actually meant.", "NAH. I think you need to clarify to her that it\u2019s not her fault. That she needs to find friends who aren\u2019t assholes. If you don\u2019t tell her directly it is not her fault she\u2019s going to go into a deeper depression than she already has. She trusted you in a vulnerable moment and, while what you said was technically true, it wasn\u2019t what was needed at the time. She needs a good friend right now and you have that chance. At the very least you should clarify she\u2019s the not the problem.", "NAH\n\nThough this comment section may be your best illustration of why she's upset.\n\nWhat you meant was she's objectively beautiful that it makes girls jealous and their insecurities make them do petty cruel things to her.\n\nWhat a lot of people apparently heard was 'it's your own fault because you're too pretty.'\n\nYou are likely bang on the money, but even if she didn't think you were blaming her, it's hard to hear it's about something she can't really change or particularly want. \n\nIf I were you I would make it clear to her that it's those girls problem, not hers. Loudly and proudly go to bat for her when you hear catty comments. You will inevitably get called a lesbian or whatever, but just ignore it and call them on their bullshit. You don't have to be her bestie, just be on her side.", "YTA\n\nI think this is a matter of good intentions, terrible execution. In an emotional moment like that, it's important to be careful with your phrasing. While you might not have meant it, you still put the blame on her. \n\nHad you started with pointing out other people acted from a place of insecurity, the blame would go to *them*, as it should. Insecurity can make people vicious and selfish, but this is not her fault.\n\nShe is not to blame for the unjustifiable actions of her former friends. It's not because she's pretty; it's because they believe they're not.", "YTA. It\u2019s not her fault other people are not faithful. And at least wait until she\u2019s not crying in the bathroom; like damn.", "being pretty isn\u2019t forcing anyone else to behave in a particular way. That\u2019s on them. U blamed her for how these folks are treating her. So yeah, YTA.", "NTA - look, she's having a hard time processing this information. \n\nI'm a woman. I remember seeing a blonde girl in my college class, this was 20 years ago before everybody had injections at 18 - her face was just SO beautiful but also she looked like a sex doll. Like, her features. \n\nAnyway. I remember being struck by her face and how pretty she was but also thinking holy shit she has to walk around with that face all day (she appeared to be a natural blonde). \n\nMy point is I understand what you're saying. I've also lived my life as a very attractive woman. \n\nI'd ask to speak with her again if I were you. I wouldn't take back *anything* you said but I would add a few things. \n\n\"Hey Girl, I'm sorry if what I said was hard for you to hear yesterday but it's the truth. I remember those awful things they said about you in middle school and it's for the same reason. *I think it must be really shitty for you, because it's such a double-edged sword.*\"\n\nAnd then just like... this is her life and she will always have this problem and she must be so fucking pretty - I can tell you - it's a serious fucking burden to have had people staring at me literally almost all the time. I have grown super accustomed to it and I try to conduct myself accordingly but it's true and it's ... well she's 17 and she will learn to get used to it. \n\nIt means men will prey on her so bad over the next ten years, all of them all ages even the skeevy ones all of them wanting naked pictures, few people being your friend for real reasons, etc.\n\nSo I'd just reach out even if she's avoiding you, and tell her that while you're sorry to break the news, you're *sorrier* about how it will impact her life because you recognize this isn't something she can change, you've basically just informed her she has a lifelong condition of pissing people off, being called a whore and being friendless. \n\nDo you realize that?\n\nSo like, some empathy for what she's going through as she figures this out in her head and tries to figure out what this means. I'm sure her professors may try to sleep with her (or they will), seriously \n\nhopefully she is smart and can use to her advantage, being a lesbian should help avoid predators I guess", "YTA and your comment isn't even factual.

There are so many women with ingrained misogyny who see other women as their competition. They will always blame the woman for tempting the man even if the other woman has no interest in the man whatsoever it\u2019s still her fault.\n\nOp, I really think your heart was in the right place and you genuinely just misstepped. Even though it was unintentional you should apologize and assure her that none of this is her fault, you weren\u2019t blaming her; their insecurities are not her responsibility.\n\nTell her she will have real lasting friendships it\u2019s just unfortunately you can\u2019t always tell who\u2019s a real friend and who\u2019s fake.\n\nThese girls aren\u2019t real friends. Real friends have your back and support you.\n\nYou said she was a lesbian- does your school have any kind of lgbtq type groups or clubs? (Unless of course she\u2019s not out)\n\nThinking she might be able to find more people she could connect with there (also if she\u2019s adamant about being gay some girl yammering about her trying to steal her boyfriend might not be as believable)\n\nI know this comes with it\u2019s own hurdles and I very much know saying you\u2019re a lesbian to some guys is just incentivizing but it might help.\n\nAlso reiterate that with friends quality over quantity every time.
