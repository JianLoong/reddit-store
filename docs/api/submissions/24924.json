{"id": 24924, "submission_id": "15uj2yz", "title": "AITA for refusing to pay for a pizza I thought was vegetarian?", "selftext": "So I went to a restaurant and ordered a pizza off the menu I thought was vegetarian. It basically just had vegetables as toppings. The menu was black, and the font was white, which made it easy to read. \n\nWhen my pizza was served, I noticed it had large ham slices melted into the cheese. I asked the waiter if that\u2019s ham and he said yes. I quickly flipped through the menu to reread the toppings and then I saw it\u2014 \u201cham\u201d in burgundy font. It almost blended into the black background of the menu so my eyes must have missed it. I\u2019m not sure why the rest of the toppings were in white, but the one topping that would make or break a meal for me was in dark red. \n\nI apologized and explained why I can\u2019t eat the pizza. He was pretty angry and told me I should have informed him I\u2019m vegetarian from the beginning. I told him I had no idea there was anything to inform him of because I thought the pizza was vegetarian by default. \n\nHe told me to just remove the ham slices myself and I told him I can\u2019t because the meat has already made contact with the meal and vegans/vegetarians often don\u2019t even eat food that was cooked in the same pan as meat. \n\nI asked if I could just order another pizza and he said I will have to still pay for the ham pizza. I refused to do so, because I didn\u2019t touch it, and even though I knew I was partially to blame for the error, I thought it was also on the restaurant for how they designed the menu.\n\nHe said he was going to talk to his boss and came back a minute later. He told me his boss agreed to make me a new pizza. But then he proceeded to berate me, telling me this isn\u2019t okay, this was my mistake, next time I should tell him I\u2019m vegetarian. \n\nI started feeling uncomfortable with the situation because he kept going on and on even after his boss resolved the issue. I told him to just cancel my whole order and bring me the bill so I could pay for my drink. I paid and left. \n\nGoing forward I\u2019m always going to clarify if a meal I\u2019m ordering has meat or not, but  AITA for not paying for the pizza? On the one hand I acknowledge it\u2019s my mistake. On the other hand I think the menu was poorly designed and so the restaurant should have expected this error to occur. Not sure why the one meat item would be in a different colour, a rather dark colour on a black menu.\n\nEDIT: You can call me an asshole, that\u2019s what I posted in this sub for, but can you people stop blowing up my dms telling me to commit suicide?
