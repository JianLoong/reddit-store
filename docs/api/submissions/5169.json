The persons I gave access to were my mother and my cousin. Recently I added my friend to it and everything was alright for a while. \n\nThen asked me if she could add her boyfriend to it. I immediately said no, I told her that enough people are already on it and I don\u2019t want to give anyone else access to my account. She insisted that she\u2019ll only give him the password and no one else. I stood my ground and still said no. Then she changed her statement and said she\u2019ll only give her boyfriend and his sister the password. That made me insist on no even more.  She said if the problem was money she would pay more. \n\nI told her that it wasn\u2019t about the money. If someone has your password they can see all your billing info and other persons profiles because it\u2019s not private. I also asked what I would do if he gave someone else my password and tons of people had access to it. \n\n\nShe kept insisting that he wouldn\u2019t give anyone access and that he\u2019s not that type of person. I told that I\u2019m not changing my mind and she never knows what will happen. \n\nShe got upset and told me that she\u2019s going to get her own Netflix and she\u2019s going to log out of mine. Later that night she deleted her profile off of Netflix. About 2 weeks later she complained to me. She said that she made the account and gave access to her boyfriend, his sister and their mother. \n\nThen she got an email that someone in another country logged on to her account. Turns out the guy's mother gave her sister the account details. She got upset and removed all of them off Netflix and changed her password.", "created_utc": 1671501049, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zqaqaj/aita_for_not_wanting_to_share_my_netflix/", "score": 90, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I swear you give people an inch and they take a mile, she doesn\u2019t sound like the greatest of friends.

I didn\u2019t this for a friend and that friend apparently was passing it out to everyone and I couldn\u2019t even watch my own account.

They can watch but cannot make changes or give the pw to someone else.", "I think you know you\u2019re NTA. Your account, your rules and it sounds like karma helped you prove the point.", "NTA.

You weren't obligated to share and she can clearly get her own. And you were exactly right not to trust them with your login info. Not your problem.

Your friend just had firsthand experience of the dangers of sharing access to your personal information.", "NTA.\n\nShe kept pushing and pushing when you said no. Begging after being told no in different ways is very annoying. Your friend hopefully learned her lesson about sharing Netflix with others. If not, well, that's on her.
