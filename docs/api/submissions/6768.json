{"id": 6768, "submission_id": "10619ns", "title": "WIBTA if I told my fianc\u00e9 to go and stay at his brother's tonight?", "selftext": "This week I had a miscarriage at 11 weeks. It happened while we were on holiday with my fianc\u00e9's family and his two children. We agreed not to tell his kids (boys aged 10 and 13), so basically I put on a brave face and through the trauma of three really bad days of cramping, pain and agony while I passed the pregnancy, I made sure the kids didn't know what was going on and I still participated in almost all of our family activites over this time. It was an absolute nightmare for me.\n\nI love his boys very much and have a great relationship with them, so even though it wasn't the best decision for me, I felt it was the right one for our family. We dropped his boys back to their Mum yesterday afternoon.\n\nThis morning he woke up early and went into the office to prepare for his first day back tomorrow. This is not unusual. Now that we are home, I am basically an emotional mess. Everything that I packed away while we were with his family and kids has come to surface and I have been crying for the last two hours.\n\nI called him, no answer. So I messaged asking him to come home because I am a mess and I dont want to be alone. He messaged me back saying first that he loved me, but needed space from me because I had said some nasty things to him while we were away.\n\nNo context as to what I might have said, and nothing else. Just two lines basically saying he wasn't going to come home when I really need him.\n\nI tried calling but he is ignoring my calls now and I asked him again to come home, but the message has been left on read and I haven't had a response.\n\nThe only thing I can think of that might even be close to 'nasty' is a conversation that I relayed that I had with his oldest about going to a Boys School next year, that he and his Dad completely dissagree on. I told my fianc\u00e9 that he needs to be open to the fact that his Son might not change his mind. I know that 13 year old feels like his Dad doesn't listen to him, because he told me, and I told his Dad that. And yes, 13 year old has said to his Dad that he doesn't feel like he is being listened to, so all I did was reiterate that. But that's it. This to me isn't enough of a reason to bail on me in the middle of one of the most traumatic events of my life.\n\nI feel incredibly used, given what I went through to make sure the kids and his family didn't have to 'deal' with our miscarriage and like I don't matter at all.\n\nWIBTA if I message him and tell him not to come home and to go and stay at his brother's tonight? I honestly don't think I can even look at him given that he has made an awful day even worse. Now I am the one who needs space.\n\nEdit 1: My fianc\u00e9 was really supportive while we were away. We couldn't leave because of the travel required and I still believe it was the right decision for the boys and our family, even if it was one of the most awful experiences of my life. We are normally a really good team during hard situations.\n\nEdit 2: I am completely floored by his response today, but do know that he really struggles to communicate when he is having a hard time.\n\nUpdate: Thank you so much to everyone who weighed in with an opinion and for the many perspectives. What this has highlighted for me is that the communication issues we have, particularly around my fianc\u00e9 not being able to connect to and articulate his needs, and to not bottle up his emotions, have absolutely demolished our relationship today. I acknowledge that I am incredibly vulnerable right now and as one poster pointed out, his response has only added to my grief and has escalated the situation for me. This was insightful and helpful. I don't know that my fianc\u00e9 actually understands how much he has hurt me today.\n\nIt was also helpful to come to the conclusion for myself that I do believe my partner is grieving the baby thay he lost too, and is handling it really badly. Also, that he is normally so reliable and is someone I can depend on, which makes his response even worse for me now. I am honestly floored by his response.\n\nBut...as one poster wrote, grief doesn't give him a pass to be an AH, and based on what other people have posted it is reasonable for me to expect him to be there for me, given that I am going through the pain and absolute trauma of a miscarriage. Today, he really let me down, and I deserve so much more. I deserve love and support.\n\nI agree with the poster who said that I can't tell him not to come home and that that would make me TA, so I am heading away in the morning. His last message to me was pretty awful, so I don't know where we go from here, but I do know that I need to get some space, take a breath, grieve and look after me. If I had to make a judgment, I would say this is an absolutely shitty situation, and there are no AHs, just two very hurt people.

He may be making up a conflict to deal with his own emotions from the loss, and she may have unintentionally escalated things (both in reality and in her own mind) to deal with her own emotions.\n\nMiscarriage's are felt justifiably as a death, and parents usually go through the entire cycle of grief when it happens. Because it's different than say, an elderly grand parent dying, it makes it all the more difficult to wrap your head and heart around. Both parents usually feel guilt and responsibility (was it something I did or didn't do that caused this?), And they also want to find someone or something to blame.. like each other (was it something YOU did or didn't do?).\n\nPersonally, I think they should both give each other some space for a very short time, breathe, speak to one another calmly and without judgment, and then look into counseling, both to bring you back together on equal footing, and to learn how to manage your grief and learn how to make it through a tragedy like this together.\n\nBest of luck to them, and I'm sorry for their loss.", "Yes, over the moon.

They were insistent and i just remember one going \u201ccan you take the day off?\u201d When the dude said yes, all three were like then go be with your wife or you will regret it.  He did go but I think it was more he didn\u2019t know what to do so he went to work. \n\nDon\u2019t know if that\u2019s your case with your husband, but I\u2019m just a random internet stranger saying your emotions are valid.  Your feelings are valid.  You went through hell with a smile on your face for the love of your stepsons.  That\u2019s admirable and brave. You absolutely have the right to grieve and mourn.\n\nEdit: If you don\u2019t feel right asking him to stay at his brother\u2019s then you could wait till he\u2019s home.  Give him one chance (and tell him he gets one chance) to explain what did you say that was so horrific as to not respond to your pleas to come home. Tell him everything you went through today and that all you needed was him.  You are most likely emotionally spent and not even wanting to do that much.  However if he has communication issues in the past then spell it the F out for him, and see what he does.  It may be that he lied and he\u2019s grieving. It may be he\u2019s a selfish AH.  No clue. But again I\u2019m so sorry OP.", "NTA but you are both grieving. I\u2019m sorry this happened to you. I had a miscarriage on vacation in Cancun years ago. We each handled it differently. Neither was \u201cright\u201d of \u201cwrong \u201c. He may be unable to be there for you because of his grief. And you may be unable to be there for him because of your loss. Time will help. Communication will help. Maybe even therapy. I\u2018be had four miscarriages. Each was different. Hugs to you both.", "NTA and behold your future. You know what really makes you uncomfortable and potentially hostile? Childbirth.  You know what can make you grumpy and self focused ? Childbirth. You know what can make you need support and love from a partner that doesn't make it all about them? Childbirth. If this guy can't support you during the heartbreaking loss of miscarriage I seriously doubt he will be present for the messy, painful chaos of Childbirth and its aftermath. I am so very sorry for your loss and I hope that you find a kind and loving partner who will support you in your times of need just as you would (exemplified by how you prioritized his families comfort over your own pain and grief) in his. Please reach out to your support people Andover on, this guy will never be there for you.", "NTA, and I hope you DID text him just that.  I would have said make it a few days or a week even!  And then, unless he comes back with his tail between his legs apologizing profusely, you dump his ass!  You deserve better!", "NTA and I'd tell him to leave permanently.  His behavior is disgusting.  I've had 5 miscarriages.  3 of which required medical intervention. My husband didn't leave my side for any of them and was allowed to gown up and be in the procedure room with me.  Which he did, holding my hand the whole time.\n\nIf I needed to cry, he held me.  If I just wanted peace he'd lie down with me and just be there with me.  If I wanted space he gave it to me.  \n\nThat is what support looks like and you deserve someone who will do that for you. I am so sorry for your loss.  If you can be with your family do that, or maybe with an understanding friend ((hugs)).  I hope you get the empathy and support you deserve.", "NTA, if you need the space it's OK to ask him to not come home tonight. Now if he disagrees and wants to come home, I'm not sure if it would be right of you to insist, but to ask, it's fine.", "NTA It is time to leave this relationship. When someone tells you who they are BELIEVE THEM.\n\nNot all romances last forever and that\u2019s ok. Someone that loves you and will cherish you is out there. Don\u2019t marry this man.", "The fact he left you alone is mind boggling. I dgaf what you said to him YOU LOST YOUR BABY and he just fucking bails?!? Do not DO NOT marry this pathetic excuse for a \u2018man\u2019. Clearly he will never be there for you when you need him. NTA at all.", "NTA. My husband has taken a week off work every time I have miscarried to take care of me and support me. I would never speak to him again if he did what your husband has put you through this past week. You are well within your rights to be hurt and furious.", "NTA. \n\nThis is the man you do not want to marry. You had to suffer mental and physical agony of losing a child alone to avoid ruining a holiday vacation because he wanted you to not ruin it for his family. Instead of comforting you and being there for you, he chose \u201cthe show must go on\u201d route and completely abandoned you.\n\nWhile I am aware that work pays bills and paid bills are required in order to avoid homelessness but for him to still keep on ignoring you and not be there for you when you two got home is so callous. \n\nIf he is willing to ignore and abandon you while you were miscarrying then he would absolutely abandon you if you were diagnosed with a serious illness or injury.", "NTA, please leave him. You deserve so much better!!", "THIS!!! NTA, OP and use the time to re-think your relationship. You are vulnerable, hurting and the hormones will not be helping, instead of supporting you, he's created some imagined slight to make you feel worse. Call your mom or your girlfriends, your tribe and let them surround you with the love and cherishing you need.", "She miscarried for 3 days.  She needed medical attention.  Have you even read up on how miscarriages can turn nasty?  It\u2019s not like having your period, FFS.", ">but he didn't want to ruin their holiday either. I supported that.\n\nOh HAYLE NAW.\n\nDidn't care much about your \"holiday\" did he? \n\n\"Hey babe, you're a real downer while dealing with all this emotional and physical pain. Can you make sure you seem all sunshiny and happy so you don't bring anyone else down? Thx babe.\"\n\nAnd later, \"hey, you weren't all sweetness and light while forcibly expelling the remains of our child on vacation, so I will not be there for you today.\"\n\nI literally lack the words to explain how big an asshole he is. \n\nGirl you had it so rough, and you suffered in silence so everyone else could be happy. That's already too much to ask, and now he's getting his knickers in a knot about how you weren't nice to him *during* all this? \n\nNope. He can find somewhere else to sleep until he comes to his senses.", "What the heck?!\n\nI mean, I can imagine lying and saying it was food poisioning or something, but pretending that nothing is happening is pretty extreme.\n\nDo his parents know now? What did they say when they found out?", "I bet his mom will be horrified when she finds out you had a miscarriage on your vacation.  You should have been taken care of, you should have seen the doctor/urgent care.  His parents should have been told.  \n\nThere were so many red flags.  HE didn\u2019t want to disrupt the vacation.  HE didn\u2019t want anyone to know.  HE wanted you to pretend to be happy.\n\nRun! Run screaming away.  Mourn the loss of your child.  Tell his parents.  Maybe they\u2019ll mourn with you.\n\nNTA.  AH doesn\u2019t begin to describe him.", "He is the one who said he 'needed space' from her while she is grieving. So let hi have his space by staying away and not forcing her from her home. OP you are NTA here at all, your fianc\u00e9e is behaving terribly and you would be completely within your rights not to want to deal with him after he abandoned you and threw some previous argument in your face at this time. You would be justified walking away from this relationship entirely right now quite frankly.", "Yep. Any decent woman would be pissed at OP's husband.", "\ud83d\udc46 this right here. This is a big red flag with huge feckin\u2019 bells tied on it.  \n\nOP miscarried for 3 days, _without medical attention_.

Those can turn _nasty_.", "NTA - i know the conclusion for OP was that there N A H and just two hurting people but the fianc\u00e9e is a massive asshole. Never learning to deal with your own emotions in a healthy way isn\u2019t a pass to be an asshole. I am so sorry for the loss they experienced. It\u2019s heartbreaking. \n\nI\u2019d pause this journey for a moment for him to work on himself. Should they continue along this path and he doesn\u2019t deal with his shit, when they have a newborn and they\u2019re sleep deprived and co-parenting and dealing with teenagers and a toddler at the same time, what\u2019s he going to do to bail on her then ? What if, unrelated to any of this, OP has some kind of medical emergency after a car accident or something, and he needs to be relied on to face what\u2019s going on and make decisions for her? \n\nLife is hard and scar and sad sometimes.

There\u2019s too much to say, most of which a therapist would go over.\n\nI\u2019ll just say this - sometimes the really tough situations are where a relationship really shines\u2026 or not. If I were in your shoes, I\u2019d be pretty hesitant to marry someone who\u2019s shown you how you can expect to be treated when things get hard. My husband wouldn\u2019t have even gone to work after something like this unless I\u2019d insisted. And he\u2019d have rushed home if I\u2019d asked. But the first guy I was engaged to? I broke that one off and I\u2019ll never be sorry - we went through something difficult and he did exactly this, he used it as a weapon and an excuse for abysmal behavior. Your spouse is arguably THE most important person in your boat - especially during crisis. Don\u2019t be afraid to drop him off at the dock if he can\u2019t figure out how to handle things in a healthy way, and not lash out or hurt you when you\u2019re already heartbroken (and dealing with a ton of hormones.)", "NTA Jesus Christ there is nothing I want more than a future update where OP has left this relationship and found peace and happiness.", "Omg NTA so much but seriously \ud83e\udd86 that man!\n\nDump him ASAP! Dump him faster than that. He is showing you right now what kind of behavior you can expect from him in the future and it will only get worse once he has you legally tied to him!

And tell everyone who asks exactly why you left!", "Dont think youll read this but NAH. He lost a child too, you know?

Yes I agree that my needs aren't more important than his. But all he had said is that he needs space because I said nasty things to him. No context or detail. He hasn't communicated anything else with me all day.\n\nIf he had told me that he was grieving and needed space that would be different. He could have talked to me, instead he chose to text me something vague and hurtful and ignore my calls. All that has done is pile pain and feelings of abandonment on top of my grief.\n\nIt's been shit for both of us, I am not denying that, but I feel like I deserved more from him today.
