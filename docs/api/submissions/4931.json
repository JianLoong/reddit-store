Josh was the from an affair between my dad and a girl, f20 (Julia). Julia gave up Josh so he is in the custody of my father. I left school at 16 to work full time, Ethan works part time and is planning to drop out to work more. Him and I pay $1200/month for rent and our landlord watches Josh when no one is home. (He is a church goer and is doing that out of kindness.) Julia has never met Josh (obviously aside from birth and during when this happened.) and is an unstable addict, herself. This is relevant so you can have some context as to how little Julia is involved. \n\nA few weeks ago I had a day off, so I took Josh to the park in not the the greatest area, homeless people hang around there. As I was standing and watching Josh a women walks up to me. Its Julia. I hadn't seen her since Josh was born. She seemed sober and she asked if she could come over and meet Josh. We exchanged numbers. A week later, after explaining that she was not to introduce herself as 'mom' she came over to meet him. I thought if she could be consistent for a while they could have a relationship. She came over and it went great. She was sober and in a good place and did not mention anything about being his bio-mom. I told her she was welcome to come over as long as Ethan or I was home. \n\nAnother week after that, at about 3 a.m someone bangs on our door. Sometimes my parents will do that if they lose the key so I got up and looked through the peep hole. Its Julia. She looked rough and was obviously high. I foolishly let her in, thinking she needed a place to sleep. She comes in and starts screaming for Josh and that his 'mother' was here to get him. Ethan and Josh sleep in a locked room due to the sometimes strange characters my parents bring home. I yell for Ethan to call 911. The cops come and arrest her. She gives them an obviously fake name. \n\nSo here is where I might be in the wrong. I tell the police her real name and she had an outstanding warrant. The police ask me if I would like to press charges, I say yes. The warrant was for intent to distribute drugs, so a heavy sentence. Later, I go on my phone and I have endless messages from Julia's friends saying I went too far, I was a kidnapper or I had ruined her life. One actually called CPS and told them my parents aren't involved in Josh's life. Now he could be taken away, and since my parents are absent and Julia likely won't be convicted he could end up w/ her or in foster care. Because of that my brother is saying i'm TA for pressing charges and telling them her actual name, and risking both he and Josh be taken. I didn't think what I did was wrong but my brother thinks I messed up and I feel a moral battle now that my family is at risk.", "created_utc": 1671233415, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/znsdgs/aita_for_not_letting_my_brothers_half_mom_take/", "score": 60, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This woman defied the boundary you clearly set. She is not a mother. Jail is where she belongs. Maybe it will help her get clean. \n\nYou are 17 now. I don't know what the laws are in your area, but at 18 you might be able to get legal guardianship of both siblings. You are doing awesome.", "NTA but you should take the steps to get legal custody of him. A child does not need to brought up in situation where their safety is at risk because their parents are doing drugs.", "I cannot imagine having to make decisions like this and deal with adversity like this at 17.  \n\nNTA of course.  The mistake was letting her into the home -- or communicating with her at all, probably -- and once that had happened, which I don't blame you for because mistakes happen, there was no way this was going to end well.\n\nI hope you get some advice from here from people who know more about CPS and stuff where you live.  There's nothing useful I can tell ya.\n\nGood luck.", "NTA but this doesn't sound healthy for any of you. It sounds like you are doing everything in your power for your siblings but you are just a kid too (even almost 18). I would strongly encourage you to search supports in your area to help promote your safety and the safety of your siblings.", "Look into getting emancipated.You might be able to get custody of BOTH of them if you are emancipated and can prove you have the means to support them.  \n\nOtherwise;  talk to the courts.  I know that people say that they are assholes, but CPS almost always try to keep families together.  You only have a few months until you are 18 anyway so they might be able to help you expedite you getting emancipated from your parents so you CAN obtain custody of your brother and nephew.  \n\nNTA.  this is an absolute dumpster fire of a situation, and it sucks.  Please give an update, I hope everything works out.", "NTA. Honestly, her behavior disgusts me and if that happened to me, she wouldn't be the only one getting arrested. You handled it great and did what you had to do to keep Josh safe.", "I haven\u2019t seen anyone mention that if Julia is 20 now and josh is 3\u2026 it wasn\u2019t an affair \ud83d\ude10. It was rape, by ops father. Now, whether that contributed to ALL of her actions, who knows. But that situation probably messed her up. \n\nNot saying what she\u2019s done recently is okay or the right thing despite him being her child, I\u2019m just saying it may be for deeper reasons than OP or anyone thinks. Ultimately, OP is NTA but maybe think a little more about the situation and see just how much that could\u2019ve affected Julia. \n\nAlso, whether she\u2019s clean or not, she\u2019s proven she would not be a fit caretaker to josh and he literally barely knows her. Do your best to protect that child and get some form of custody asap, best of luck to your family", "NTA. You set clear boundaries, which she agreed to, and then violated. The fact that she has warrants is her own problem, and now she has to face the consequences of her own actions. You decided to protect your siblings. She decided to break the law. You both made your choices.", "NTA and nothing that happens as a result of you calling the police and being honest about who she is is your fault. You are doing amazing things to keep your family going.  Your parents are unfit and it is not  your job as the oldest to pay the rent and do all you are doing.\n\nOn that night when J showed up,  you did what was necessary to protect your brothers and yourself. There might be unexpected issues that arise, but that night, you did what you had to do. It's easy to look back and think maybe you could have done something different,  but even then, there would have been consequences. For better or worse,  you did right.", "NTA, but I would start the process NOW of finding an extended family member who is able to be a foster until you are 18, or until longer needed. Having that in your corner will significantly lessen any chance of your brothers being separated from each other and you.", "NTA. You are doing far more than anyone could possibly ask of you. I don't want to sound cruel, but honestly all 3 of you would probably be better off *not* in the situation you describe.   \n\n\nIf that happens get a GED between now and when you turn 18 and then find a local non-profit that can help you apply for assistance and get your brothers back.", "NTA. If someone isn't fit to be a parent, then they shouldn't have custody.\n\nAlso, did I read that correctly? She was 17 when her child was born?? And the father was a full-grown adult??

Clearly the parents aren't fit to have custody but sometimes you need to play nice in bad situations to prevent a possible worse situation.", "Just replying to the top comment to answer some questions.\n\n1. Im 18 in March\n2. Yes, Julia was underage when the affair happened. She was kicked out of her house due to drug use and was on the street at the time. I 100% know that is wrong, but I was only 13/14 when they saw each other and there is very little I can/could do. \n3. I'm talking to my landlord about temporarily taking custody until i'm able too. Hes willing however based on what I have researched, Both my father and Julia would have to relinquish rights to him. Obviously Julia would not agree to that, and my father hasn't been to my apartment in at least a month.  \n4. (No one asked this I just wanted to let you guys know) Ethan is staying at a friends house for a while, as it was pretty hostile between us. Hes safe and i'm in contact with the friends mom (obviously he doesn't know that)\n5. So far CPS (called something different here, i'm not american) has not shown up or called yet. But I really don't doubt Julia's friends when they said they were calling.\n\nThank you guys for your helpful comments. Its really nice to vent to strangers sometimes", "Your advice is to tell a 17 year old child she should apply for legal custody of another child, are you insane?\n\nIf this is real then CPS needs to get involved in all of these abused and exploited childrens lives, including OP.", "I did miss the age but she may be able to provide proof that she is the main caregiver. Or hopefully 18 isn\u2019t far away", "Seriously though. Almost every comment was encouraging her to get custody of her 2 siblings. The whole situation is absolutely heart breaking, but pushing for her to raise a 3 and 16 year old...at 17? No way.", "Did you see where I said I missed the age?", "No?"]}
