Josh was the from an affair between my dad and a girl, f20 (Julia). Julia gave up Josh so he is in the custody of my father. I left school at 16 to work full time, Ethan works part time and is planning to drop out to work more. Him and I pay $1200/month for rent and our landlord watches Josh when no one is home. (He is a church goer and is doing that out of kindness.) Julia has never met Josh (obviously aside from birth and during when this happened.) and is an unstable addict, herself. This is relevant so you can have some context as to how little Julia is involved. \n\nA few weeks ago I had a day off, so I took Josh to the park in not the the greatest area, homeless people hang around there. As I was standing and watching Josh a women walks up to me. Its Julia. I hadn't seen her since Josh was born. She seemed sober and she asked if she could come over and meet Josh. We exchanged numbers. A week later, after explaining that she was not to introduce herself as 'mom' she came over to meet him. I thought if she could be consistent for a while they could have a relationship. She came over and it went great. She was sober and in a good place and did not mention anything about being his bio-mom. I told her she was welcome to come over as long as Ethan or I was home. \n\nAnother week after that, at about 3 a.m someone bangs on our door. Sometimes my parents will do that if they lose the key so I got up and looked through the peep hole. Its Julia. She looked rough and was obviously high. I foolishly let her in, thinking she needed a place to sleep. She comes in and starts screaming for Josh and that his 'mother' was here to get him. Ethan and Josh sleep in a locked room due to the sometimes strange characters my parents bring home. I yell for Ethan to call 911. The cops come and arrest her. She gives them an obviously fake name. \n\nSo here is where I might be in the wrong. I tell the police her real name and she had an outstanding warrant. The police ask me if I would like to press charges, I say yes. The warrant was for intent to distribute drugs, so a heavy sentence. Later, I go on my phone and I have endless messages from Julia's friends saying I went too far, I was a kidnapper or I had ruined her life. One actually called CPS and told them my parents aren't involved in Josh's life. Now he could be taken away, and since my parents are absent and Julia likely won't be convicted he could end up w/ her or in foster care. Because of that my brother is saying i'm TA for pressing charges and telling them her actual name, and risking both he and Josh be taken. I didn't think what I did was wrong but my brother thinks I messed up and I feel a moral battle now that my family is at risk.", "created_utc": 1671233415, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/znsdgs/aita_for_not_letting_my_brothers_half_mom_take/", "score": 84, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Do your best to protect that child and get some form of custody asap, best of luck to your family", "NTA. You set clear boundaries, which she agreed to, and then violated.

For better or worse,  you did right.", "NTA, but I would start the process NOW of finding an extended family member who is able to be a foster until you are 18, or until longer needed.

Clearly the parents aren't fit to have custody but sometimes you need to play nice in bad situations to prevent a possible worse situation.", "Just replying to the top comment to answer some questions.\n\n1. Im 18 in March\n2. Yes, Julia was underage when the affair happened. She was kicked out of her house due to drug use and was on the street at the time. I 100% know that is wrong, but I was only 13/14 when they saw each other and there is very little I can/could do. \n3. I'm talking to my landlord about temporarily taking custody until i'm able too. Hes willing however based on what I have researched, Both my father and Julia would have to relinquish rights to him. Obviously Julia would not agree to that, and my father hasn't been to my apartment in at least a month.  \n4. (No one asked this I just wanted to let you guys know) Ethan is staying at a friends house for a while, as it was pretty hostile between us. Hes safe and i'm in contact with the friends mom (obviously he doesn't know that)\n5. So far CPS (called something different here, i'm not american) has not shown up or called yet. But I really don't doubt Julia's friends when they said they were calling.\n\nThank you guys for your helpful comments. Its really nice to vent to strangers sometimes", "Your advice is to tell a 17 year old child she should apply for legal custody of another child, are you insane?\n\nIf this is real then CPS needs to get involved in all of these abused and exploited childrens lives, including OP.", "I did miss the age but she may be able to provide proof that she is the main caregiver. Or hopefully 18 isn\u2019t far away", "Seriously though. Almost every comment was encouraging her to get custody of her 2 siblings. The whole situation is absolutely heart breaking, but pushing for her to raise a 3 and 16 year old...at 17? No way.", "Did you see where I said I missed the age?", "No?", "NTA.  Julia is his mother, yes.  She's also an unstable addict.  Your parents are unstable addicts.  You left school at 16, so you didn't even complete your education.  That means it's going to be hard for you to be financially stable in the future.  Your 14-year-old brother is also planning to drop out, meaning he won't be financially stable.  I get that you're trying to do the right thing by your brother and half-brother but being with you isn't necessarily the best thing for your half-brother.  Not as long as your parents are still actively using and part of the household.\n\nJulia's friends are probably also addicts, so of course they wouldn't see a problem with her behavior.  Social services do need to be involved.  It sounds like you and your 14-year-old brother need to be emancipated.  That would mean that you are capable of providing food and shelter for yourselves and you would legally be declared adults.  Then you could rent an apartment separately from your parents (if it's a smaller place, it would be cheaper) and petition for custody of your half-brother.  Based on the fact that you've basically been raising him all along, you would have a fairly good chance (courts like to place kids with stable members of their own families if possible).  Social services could also help you and your 14-year-old brother get HS equivalency certificates (G.E.D.s) and additional support for your half-brother.", "that warrant was out there and would have eventually caught up with her.  NTA.  you did right.", "Sweetie, you're NTA. You're dealing, as best you can, with a very difficult situation. It sounds like the possible root of your brother's anger with you is fear - fear of losing your younger brother.\n\nWhen you decided to press charges against Julia when the police were there, I doubt that you were fully aware of all the legal consequences that might unfold from that the moment you did it, in that high stress/chaos environment. Some of those consequences you may have wanted, and some may have played out in a way you didn't expect. Oftentimes people will assume that the consequences of our actions (like possibly losing your baby brother) were obvious to us in the moment, or our intentions, which is simply not true, and I wonder if something like this is happening in your brother's mind. He's  likely scared of what might happen and sees you as the responsible catalyst of that possibility. Thinking about his thinking as rooted in fear, and bring expressed in anger (which feels more powerful) may be a helpful place to communicate with him to eventually mend bridges, but that's not your job. I just say this bc it sounds like you and your brother have a bond and the hostility btw you is stressing you out. I just know that when I see ppl's reactions as being based in fear, I am able to take things less personally and be patient for a reconciliation.\n\nYou also need to try to give yourself a break for things playing out in the stressful ways they did, when you decided to press charges- it was the right decision, and I'm sorry its caused you so much woe.\n\nYou are not an asshole. It feels clear to me that you are a bright, responsible, compassionate, resourceful, and capable young woman. This situation you are in sounds very difficult and complex, and I wish for you that life had started out easier for you. Considering how you've handled things so far, I have no doubt that you will be able to move far beyond your present circumstances.\n\nI know you need to be working at the moment, but perhaps consider whether involving services for Josh might actually be able to help you create more stability for yourself, and therefore help Josh in the long run. Here I'm thinking about you going back to school at some point (as a University teacher I can tell you have a bright mind). You are worth a bright future and perhaps there are opportunities in your situation right now to ensure safety for Josh and longer-term planning for you, and your brother.  Perhaps you can ask for a truce and conversation with your brother and ask him for his help figuring this situation out, by being vulnerable and honest about your fears as well. I've seen this approach reset people's relationships.\n\nThings are hard right now, and will be for awhile. But they will get better, bit by bit. Ask for help, sweetie, you are so so worthy of it.", "You poor thing. At 17, you are more responsible than many adults and you have way too much on your plate. Good for you for keeping your siblings safe, but you need help. Do you have any extended family who can help? If not, I suggest talking with your school counselor and see if you can get help. \n\nHonestly CPS SHOULD be stepping in here. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry you\u2019ve been dealt such a crappy hand when it comes to parents.\n\nYou\u2019re definitely NTA and did the right thing.", "Yup. And OP said that she was homeless at the time of the rape, so she was even more vulnerable.", "to be perfectly honest... it may be for the best that CPS gets involved - but hear me out on this.\n\ni know you're working the hardest you can to keep this going and to keep your siblings together, but the fact is you're a child who shouldn't have to and i'm not sure that you *can*. the situation you've got right now is hinging on your *fourteen year old brother dropping out of high school to help support the three of you*. that is *not* sustainable and not good for *any* of you as it'll hamstring you and your brother if you go down this road, and i'm not talking eventually - it'll be right away. decent paying jobs demand education. that's just a fact.\n\nnow if CPS gets involved? they will likely be able to help you. you are only a few months short of being eighteen, you've been taking care of them best you can, these people will listen to you AND notice that the technical adults in your situation are drug addicts with various police records. if you have any evidence or proof of your parents endangering or neglecting you guys (such as...your landlord's testimony of what is going on in your house? and the receipts/bank records of who's been paying rent lately? these are facts in your favor) then the social workers there may well assist you in a) emancipation, b) terminating whatever rights your dad or Julia have to Josh and Ethan, and c) *getting you assistance*.\n\ni'm sure you've done plenty of research but there's so many programs out there that can help you. food stamps, cash assistance, utility subsidies, Medicaid, child tax credit - these are but a few i can think of off the top of my head.\n\nyou are insanely determined to have made it this far and i'm in awe of you... but this is not a good spot for you to be in and something has to give. preferably on your terms, on your report and say-so to CPS before they get whatever crazy nonsense Julia's junkie monkeys send their way.", "The thing is, it sounds like she is already doing that. Unless I read that wrong, it sounds like OP and her brother are the ones paying rent. It might be safer for them to have their parents out of their lives, but it certainly wouldn\u2019t be ideal for sure.\n\nIt would be better if they had a safe adult they could live with. It would be better if they had someone to take care of them so they could still be children. But there\u2019s a chance they don\u2019t have a family member they can live with beyond their parents.\n\nIt really is sad, but sometimes almost-adult children are forced into these situations.  The real AH are clearly the junkie parents, but especially the dad who had an affair with a 16/17 year old.", "Oh she definitely is already doing it and her parents are definitely the AH. And it sucks that they'll likely all be split up in foster care. But she's already had to drop out of school, her brother is on the verge of dropping out. They're not going to have the chance to be successful/happy/secure in life if she takes custody and doesn't get to finish school/GED, get counseling, etc. She is also a (very mature) kid."]}
