My partner (28M) and I (21F), found out two weeks ago that I'm pregnant. We were very shocked and excited because I was told I could never have kids. It's still really early (I'm only 5 weeks along) and I'm considered very high risk for a miscarriage so we didn't want to tell anyone but our parents and a few really close people. My sister and I have never been close. She is constantly trying to make everything about herself and sabotage anything that is going good for me. She found out by accident and immediately went to told a bunch of people even though she promised me she wouldn't. She lied to me about too after the fact. Her and I got into a  huge fight about it and we haven't spoken since. She claims it's not that big of a deal and she should be able to tell anyone she wants and I said if it wasn't that big of a deal she wouldn't have felt the need to lie to me about it. I also told her that my partner and I didn't want a bunch of people to know, especially BEFORE his parents, since I'm such high risk for a miscarriage. She said that since she doesn't want me to keep the baby anyways because she is older and should be giving my parents their first grandchild, that wouldn't be such a bad thing if that happened anyways. To make matters worse, she made sure to tell the three people that I most certainly did not want to know right away and they told people too. Now she has gone to my parents and lied about it to make me seem like the bad guy. My aunt, partner, and best friend all agree that she's the one in the wrong, but I'm starting to second guess myself. Her and I aren't speaking anymore over this and I basically told her if she cannot respect boundaries my partner and I set NOW there is no way she will ever be apart of our child's life. We live in a really small town so once a few people know it spreads like wildfire and everyone knows. My partner and I wanted to be able to enjoy the pregnancy with just us and a few select people knowing for a while longer before we told the whole world, but now it feels like she's ruined that.\nSo what do you think Reddit? AITA for calling out my sister for sabotaging my pregnancy news just because she's jealous?\n\nEdit: Wow thank you all so much for the support! It has given the validation I needed to stick to my instincts on this one. For some clarification, the reason we found out so early was because I was very sick and in the hospital. We told my parents because they were concerned about me being so sick. My sister overheard my mom talking to my dad about how excited she was for me and how she was glad nothing was seriously wrong. The second we all found out my sister knew we all asked her not to say anything. She went right to her boyfriend and our grandmother who has abused me my entire life. I'm horrible at standing up for myself and every time I've tried to go NC with her in the past she's always made me feel guilty so I never followed through, but this time I'm sticking to it. I'm protecting my child and my future family and someone as hateful as her has no right being apart of it. I will definitely be talking with my parents soon and informing them that if they cannot also respect that boundary of her having nothing to do with my child, then they too will no longer be involved. I don't ever want to make my parents choose between their children, but I will always choose protecting my child over making other people happy.", "created_utc": 1680012279, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/124ptbb/aita_for_calling_out_my_sister_for_telling_a/", "score": 154, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
