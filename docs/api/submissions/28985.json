I have always said how much I appreciate her things because we didn\u2019t have enough money to get new decor / furniture. \n\nHer style is nothing like mine. Everything is dark maroon and brown tones. If I could decorate myself, I\u2019d have a maxamillian - emerald green , gold and pink  - boho type of vibe. \n\nFrom the beginning of our relationship I learned not to say anything negative about his mothers things. \n\nAlso, I would be happy to move his mother\u2019s things to another designated spot instead of taking up the majority of our home. \n\nWhen she passed away he told me I could have her clothes & I picked a few things out but didn\u2019t want much because it just isn\u2019t my style. \n\nShe was in her late 50\u2019s while I was in my early 20\u2019s. He took offense to this as if her things weren\u2019t \u201cgood enough\u201d for me.\n\nNow I\u2019m getting the same situation with her things. There isn\u2019t one room here that is \u201cdecorated\u201d with much of anything I\u2019ve chosen. Her things take up the space everywhere.\n\nYesterday I took down 2 paintings (that were not hers, 1 I painted myself and the others were from the store). \n\nMy husband comes home and asks why did I take them down. \n\nI say because I am growing tired of living in a home that doesn\u2019t feel like my own. \n\nHe said \u201cso you feel like you have to pick everything out for it to feel like your home?\u201d\n\nMind you, I have BARELY picked out any decor in this house. He was upset because he \u201cchose\u201d those two paintings to be up by our bed\u2026\n\nI said \u201cif I could I would take more paintings down and decorate how I want but I know we\u2019re not in the financial space to do that\u201d.\n\nHe got angry , got up and proceeded to take down all the paintings and decor in the house.\n\n I didn\u2019t ask him to do that nor was I trying to \u201ctiptoe\u201d to him doing this. \n\nI didn\u2019t want him to take down the paintings.\n\nHe took my feelings as an offense against his mom.\n\nI was trying to open up a conversation but it escalated very quickly. I barely even spoke and now the paintings are just slanted on the floor, in the way of things.\n\nTell me\u2026what should I do with the paintings? \n\nLeave them where they are for him to do something with them or put them back up?\n\nDid I fuck up by telling him my feelings about our home? \n\nSide note: he is very artistic and tapped into his \u201cfeminine\u201d side. He takes decorating kind of seriously and always want a say in how our home is decorated (hence the reason why I haven\u2019t done much myself).", "created_utc": 1697397111, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/178mkzs/aita_for_wanting_to_remove_my_husbands_deceased/", "score": 1865, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Try to be an emotionally calm and nurturing when you bring up this conversation. Before you start, see if he is in a good place (not still mad about all this) and if he seems not to get over it, then just start with a \u201cwe need to talk, but I want to do this as calmly as possible because I do not want to fight, and I don\u2019t mean to insult, but I need to say some things and J don\u2019t want you to take it as an attack in any way.\u201d \n\nDo some kind of analogy about how everyone likes donuts, even if it\u2019s not the same kind of donuts (or some kind of food .

I have always said how much I appreciate her things because we didn\u2019t have enough money to get new decor / furniture. \n\nHer style is nothing like mine. Everything is dark maroon and brown tones. If I could decorate myself, I\u2019d have a maxamillian - emerald green , gold and pink  - boho type of vibe. \n\nFrom the beginning of our relationship I learned not to say anything negative about his mothers things. \n\nAlso, I would be happy to move his mother\u2019s things to another designated spot instead of taking up the majority of our home. \n\nWhen she passed away he told me I could have her clothes & I picked a few things out but didn\u2019t want much because it just isn\u2019t my style. \n\nShe was in her late 50\u2019s while I was in my early 20\u2019s. He took offense to this as if her things weren\u2019t \u201cgood enough\u201d for me.\n\nNow I\u2019m getting the same situation with her things. There isn\u2019t one room here that is \u201cdecorated\u201d with much of anything I\u2019ve chosen. Her things take up the space everywhere.\n\nYesterday I took down 2 paintings (that were not hers, 1 I painted myself and the others were from the store). \n\nMy husband comes home and asks why did I take them down. \n\nI say because I am growing tired of living in a home that doesn\u2019t feel like my own. \n\nHe said \u201cso you feel like you have to pick everything out for it to feel like your home?\u201d\n\nMind you, I have BARELY picked out any decor in this house. He was upset because he \u201cchose\u201d those two paintings to be up by our bed\u2026\n\nI said \u201cif I could I would take more paintings down and decorate how I want but I know we\u2019re not in the financial space to do that\u201d.\n\nHe got angry , got up and proceeded to take down all the paintings and decor in the house.\n\n I didn\u2019t ask him to do that nor was I trying to \u201ctiptoe\u201d to him doing this. \n\nI didn\u2019t want him to take down the paintings.\n\nHe took my feelings as an offense against his mom.\n\nI was trying to open up a conversation but it escalated very quickly. I barely even spoke and now the paintings are just slanted on the floor, in the way of things.\n\nTell me\u2026what should I do with the paintings? \n\nLeave them where they are for him to do something with them or put them back up?\n\nDid I fuck up by telling him my feelings about our home? \n\nSide note: he is very artistic and tapped into his \u201cfeminine\u201d side. He takes decorating kind of seriously and always want a say in how our home is decorated (hence the reason why I haven\u2019t done much myself).\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
