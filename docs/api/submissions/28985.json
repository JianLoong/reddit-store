I have always said how much I appreciate her things because we didn\u2019t have enough money to get new decor / furniture. \n\nHer style is nothing like mine. Everything is dark maroon and brown tones. If I could decorate myself, I\u2019d have a maxamillian - emerald green , gold and pink  - boho type of vibe. \n\nFrom the beginning of our relationship I learned not to say anything negative about his mothers things. \n\nAlso, I would be happy to move his mother\u2019s things to another designated spot instead of taking up the majority of our home. \n\nWhen she passed away he told me I could have her clothes & I picked a few things out but didn\u2019t want much because it just isn\u2019t my style. \n\nShe was in her late 50\u2019s while I was in my early 20\u2019s. He took offense to this as if her things weren\u2019t \u201cgood enough\u201d for me.\n\nNow I\u2019m getting the same situation with her things. There isn\u2019t one room here that is \u201cdecorated\u201d with much of anything I\u2019ve chosen. Her things take up the space everywhere.\n\nYesterday I took down 2 paintings (that were not hers, 1 I painted myself and the others were from the store). \n\nMy husband comes home and asks why did I take them down. \n\nI say because I am growing tired of living in a home that doesn\u2019t feel like my own. \n\nHe said \u201cso you feel like you have to pick everything out for it to feel like your home?\u201d\n\nMind you, I have BARELY picked out any decor in this house. He was upset because he \u201cchose\u201d those two paintings to be up by our bed\u2026\n\nI said \u201cif I could I would take more paintings down and decorate how I want but I know we\u2019re not in the financial space to do that\u201d.\n\nHe got angry , got up and proceeded to take down all the paintings and decor in the house.\n\n I didn\u2019t ask him to do that nor was I trying to \u201ctiptoe\u201d to him doing this. \n\nI didn\u2019t want him to take down the paintings.\n\nHe took my feelings as an offense against his mom.\n\nI was trying to open up a conversation but it escalated very quickly. I barely even spoke and now the paintings are just slanted on the floor, in the way of things.\n\nTell me\u2026what should I do with the paintings? \n\nLeave them where they are for him to do something with them or put them back up?\n\nDid I fuck up by telling him my feelings about our home? \n\nSide note: he is very artistic and tapped into his \u201cfeminine\u201d side. He takes decorating kind of seriously and always want a say in how our home is decorated (hence the reason why I haven\u2019t done much myself).", "created_utc": 1697397111, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/178mkzs/aita_for_wanting_to_remove_my_husbands_deceased/", "score": 953, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Try to be an emotionally calm and nurturing when you bring up this conversation. Before you start, see if he is in a good place (not still mad about all this) and if he seems not to get over it, then just start with a \u201cwe need to talk, but I want to do this as calmly as possible because I do not want to fight, and I don\u2019t mean to insult, but I need to say some things and J don\u2019t want you to take it as an attack in any way.\u201d \n\nDo some kind of analogy about how everyone likes donuts, even if it\u2019s not the same kind of donuts (or some kind of food .

I have always said how much I appreciate her things because we didn\u2019t have enough money to get new decor / furniture. \n\nHer style is nothing like mine. Everything is dark maroon and brown tones. If I could decorate myself, I\u2019d have a maxamillian - emerald green , gold and pink  - boho type of vibe. \n\nFrom the beginning of our relationship I learned not to say anything negative about his mothers things. \n\nAlso, I would be happy to move his mother\u2019s things to another designated spot instead of taking up the majority of our home. \n\nWhen she passed away he told me I could have her clothes & I picked a few things out but didn\u2019t want much because it just isn\u2019t my style. \n\nShe was in her late 50\u2019s while I was in my early 20\u2019s. He took offense to this as if her things weren\u2019t \u201cgood enough\u201d for me.\n\nNow I\u2019m getting the same situation with her things. There isn\u2019t one room here that is \u201cdecorated\u201d with much of anything I\u2019ve chosen. Her things take up the space everywhere.\n\nYesterday I took down 2 paintings (that were not hers, 1 I painted myself and the others were from the store). \n\nMy husband comes home and asks why did I take them down. \n\nI say because I am growing tired of living in a home that doesn\u2019t feel like my own. \n\nHe said \u201cso you feel like you have to pick everything out for it to feel like your home?\u201d\n\nMind you, I have BARELY picked out any decor in this house. He was upset because he \u201cchose\u201d those two paintings to be up by our bed\u2026\n\nI said \u201cif I could I would take more paintings down and decorate how I want but I know we\u2019re not in the financial space to do that\u201d.\n\nHe got angry , got up and proceeded to take down all the paintings and decor in the house.\n\n I didn\u2019t ask him to do that nor was I trying to \u201ctiptoe\u201d to him doing this. \n\nI didn\u2019t want him to take down the paintings.\n\nHe took my feelings as an offense against his mom.\n\nI was trying to open up a conversation but it escalated very quickly. I barely even spoke and now the paintings are just slanted on the floor, in the way of things.\n\nTell me\u2026what should I do with the paintings? \n\nLeave them where they are for him to do something with them or put them back up?\n\nDid I fuck up by telling him my feelings about our home? \n\nSide note: he is very artistic and tapped into his \u201cfeminine\u201d side. He takes decorating kind of seriously and always want a say in how our home is decorated (hence the reason why I haven\u2019t done much myself).\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

This is just the current manifestation. Be prepared for future outbursts. No amount of tiptoeing will prevent that. I guarantee.", "Exactly. File and move on to a man that wants you in cool stuff from H&M not dressed as his 50 year old mother. WTF.", "As soon as I started reading this it reminded me of Big Bang Theory with Howard & his mom!", "\"I get the feeling your husband is much older than you and you were a replacement for his mother.\"\n\nThere was nothing in OP's post to justify this part of your comment. You have something else going on in your mind.", "Because they're poor and everything else costs money they don't have", "Who is saying it isn't his space? Do you think you have fully understood what is happening here? OP is the one who doesn't have any input into the home decorating, her bf has basically all of it, and bf is the one who makes OP feel unsafe to make decisions in her own home. So why do you feel the need to emphasise it is his space too, when from the facts we have it is clear he thinks the entire place is \"his space\".", "He treats the kids like gold. People comment on how great of a father is all the time. \n\nHe plays with them, takes them on adventures, reads to them, etc. when he is around (he\u2019s a workaholic so he\u2019s only around in the mornings before they go to daycare around 10). \n\nI\u2019m not worried about how he treats them, but how he treats ME in front of them is the problem.", "Why is Iranian yogurt a thing?", "Probably cause he knows the therapist will be hard to get on his side", "Not trying to nitpick but as a former therapist what you\u2019re doing may not be actual \u201ccounseling\u201d. Not sure what your community is and what the regulations are but sometimes people aren\u2019t qualified and call it counseling. I see this sometimes in religious communities and it can justify keeping women in line but they shouldn\u2019t present themselves as a counselor in my opinion", "Then it isnt working. The point of counseling isnt to hear ur own voice and air out your issues for fun, it\u2019s to lay out a strategy and battle plan for the issues actively harming it. He refuses a traditional therapist probably bc he knows it\u2019ll either loosen the hold he currently has or it\u2019ll encourage you to poke holes in his behavior and logic more often. He sounds seriously unwell and repressed.", "My ex was like this, it turns out this quick temper spiking and then taking everything down is an abuse tactic. You are likely in an emotionally abusive relationship. Considering his behavioral issue and trauma people like this use that as an excuse or for sympathy to keep you with him. My advice would be to get out. You will feel so much better when you are able to make decisions around your house. The freedom you feel will be so much better than any love you feel for him. Not being scared of someone else\u2019s reaction is so liberating. And then you may find someone who doesn\u2019t mind if you change the decor, or doesn\u2019t have outbursts and take offense to other things.", "Reminds me of the movie Psycho.", "The part about him offering his mother\u2019s clothes to his wife?", "Thanks for your reply.  You don't know what projecting means. He gave her his dead mothers clothes and was upset she didn't want them and he won't allow changes to his mothwrs decor.... He wants her to dress like his mother ans live like his mother,  I don't know what else anyone could gather from these actions.", "I got the same feeling, maybe the show fits you.", "How he treats you in front of them is just as important as how he treats them. \n\nHe is teaching your children how to treat others. Who do you want your kids to be when you send them out into the world? Would you be proud of them if they treated their future spouse the way he treats you?", "The kids are in daycare so not old enough for school yet. He treats them like gold because they don't have their own opinions like that yet, beyond the usual toddler sort of things.  THey don't challenge him that way yet.", "Understandable! I\u2019m glad he isn\u2019t nasty to them as well, but you\u2019re right. They shouldn\u2019t grow up thinking this is ok.", "Use the search feature of this sub. You\u2019ll find the thread.", "This. Everyone wants to feel safe and feel heard when they express a concern during therapy. Not many can take constructive criticism if needed, so he may not want to go. \n\nWhen it comes to advice from the elders, I take some of it with a grain of salt because some elders like to look at the men with rose colored glasses as though their behavior isn\u2019t THAT bad or nothing\u2019s wrong with some of their behavior. The elders have some generational issues to deal with as well. You should not have to tiptoe around ever. It\u2019s an intimidation tactic used to keep you compliant.", "That sounds very close to what we\u2019re experiencing. The elder even mentions how my period may affect our relationship. I was ready to flip the fuxking table.", "Especially with a 30 age difference between wife and mother. I didn't keep many of my own mother's clothes, because she was over 2 decades older than me, and our styles were different.", "Mama Bates vibe loud & clear.", "Screams emotional incest honestly", "Or it is easier to dismiss their tastes or their refusal to certain things like They Are Children! They do not know what they say!", "That\u2019s a good point", "Yeah, and once they are teens and have their OWN opinions and needs? Expect some major issues between them and their dad.", "I'm not that interested.", "Jesus girl. No. That is not legitimate in any kind of sense. Just another method to hold you down.", "Absolutely not. Absolutely frigging no. Religious counseling isn\u2019t counseling. Things will never change and your husband will never be held accountable for his behaviors.", "WHAT?\n\nOh, yeah, hell no. That is not therapy or counseling. That is two against one and you are the one.", "Oh; this is way worse. You might have to either abandon ship or this form of \u201ccommunity counseling\u201d. The counseling is not in your favor and might not be qualified to even call themselves that.", "You don't deserve to know about Iranian yogurt \ud83d\ude02"]}
