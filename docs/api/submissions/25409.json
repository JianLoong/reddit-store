This was not a work event for me but still a networking opportunity and a gift from my boss\u2019s personal friend.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 was visiting family so I invited my friend Sara to join me. She arrived at my house Saturday afternoon to get ready with me. She had brought a dress to wear that I didn\u2019t think she should. It was very pretty but more like a club dress than an event dress, bright pink and very short. And our opera is known for a \u201cno dress code, just be fabulous\u201d approach so it was fine for the venue itself but I knew the pre party was going to be an older, more \u201ctraditional opera dress\u201d crowd (I wore a deep green floor length dress, for reference). I offered her the option of choosing something out of my closet and told her that I thought she might be uncomfortable at the party because of the type of group they were but she wanted to wear that dress so I didn\u2019t push it.\n\nAt the party, most of the attendees didn\u2019t seem interested in engaging with her and while outwardly polite, it did feel like they were equally uncomfortable with her presence as she was being there. She stayed next to me the whole time which was fine but she was sullen and kept grabbing my arm to whisper in my ear that we should leave. \n\nAfter the 3rd time Sara pulled me out of a conversation and told me she wanted us to leave the party, I got irritated and told her it was too damn bad that she was uncomfortable, I warned her. There\u2019s two bars out in the public area, she could go hang out there and I\u2019d join her in an hour for the show but I couldn\u2019t leave yet without looking bad. I might not have been \u201cworking\u201d but I accepted the invitation and now my behavior here reflects on my boss and that ultimately affects my job regardless of it not being officially work.\n\nSara stayed at the party instead and eventually it was over and we attended the show. She didn\u2019t speak to me at all on the drive home and texted me after I dropped her off that she was upset by the way I had treated her and that I should have left when she wanted. I think that\u2019s unfair, I talk about my job all the time and she knows very well what expectations are placed on me at these events and how I am expected to act. I tried to tell her but obviously I wasn\u2019t going to force her to change?

I occasionally go to events that are easy for men, it's black tie. But what is the dress code for women? As you have deduced,  it depends on formality of the event and audience. I usually call and ask, is it long dress, cocktail length dress or posh trousers and smart jacket? We work it out beforehand.  It's embarrassing to be dressed differently  and that's without the faux pas of wearing a clubbing dress. \n\nI'm not surprised Sara felt uncomfortable but she didn't listen  and misjudged her attire. The immediate compromise would have been for her to go to the other bar and leave you to your networking. Sulking and trying to ruin your event was silly.", "The fact you\u2019re even asking this question shows you\u2019re a kind, empathetic person. Sara did a dumb thing that she was warned against.

Than this is on her. Learning the appropriate outfits for different social settings is part of  becoming an adult.

Especially because she could have gone to the open bars and like many people, waited for the opera to start and had a seat and a drink and looked at her phone. She didn't need you to leave with her in order to get somewhere safe, or for a ride, etc, so she had full autonomy to step out of the party and still be in a safe environment. \n\nIt doesn't really matter that you told her she wasn't dressed exactly right, she wasn't wearing sweats or anything like that, and she is also an adult who should understand this was a work function for you and she needed to make it work or sit and wait for you.", "NTA, it's the opera and a work event. She should have dressed appropriately and known that you had professional mingling to do.", "NTA, some people don't have any sense of propriety. Frankly seeing her at your house would have been enough for me to cancel her ticket and tell her to head home or to a bar where it might be appropriate. \n\nThe onus is on the guest of an event to conform to the rules, not on the event to make exceptions.", "It could also be that your boss gifted you these tickets to, I don\u2019t know, enjoy and let your hair down. Not everything is about work and those people at the party didn\u2019t know who got you the tickets. So it didn\u2019t reflect on your job or your boss in any way. That you chose to network is fine, and as long as Sara knew that, you did nothing wrong. But maybe you could have made some time, just you and her, to have a little fun and crack some jokes. NAH", "NTA. F*ck around and find out. Wear an inappropriate dress and be uncomfortable. You\u2019re not her babysitter and this was through a work connection.", "INFO: why didn\u2019t you cancel her invitation when she was clearly not willing to dress appropriately for your work event?\n\nIt will have reflected badly that the two of you were there together, and that she was sulking and being rude the whole time. \n\nIt sounds like you weren\u2019t clear enough that her decisions & behaviour weren\u2019t acceptable for the event, and would result in her losing her invitation. \n\nDo you think you were sufficiently clear?", "ESH. im sorry, maybe im just crazy, but why would you invite your friend to a networking event if you were just going to ignore them the whole time?  why wouldnt you tell her that her outfit was inappropriate for the event and tell her that if she can't dress appropriately, her invitation would be revoked? Did you not already know your friend enough to know that this kind of event was not something that she would enjoy? it sounds like she's not the kind of person who would mesh well with that kind of event in the first place, so inviting her to begin with was a mistake. \n\nLike no, you shouldnt have left when she wanted, but at the same time, why would you put either one of you in this position in the first place?", "NAH.\n\nYou warn her about the dress, you told her that it was important for you to stay here and she's an adult. She wasn't in danger or having a mental episode, she's a big girl that can leave the party and find a way to occupy herself for what I would expect is 1 hour-30min? \n\nAt the same time, it wasn't a work event, you invited her as your friend and you kind of just brushed her off. Maybe I'm wrong, but I don't think your friend is used to this type of event and she just didn't know what your warning was implying. You can't really blame her really thrust you anymore, especially in situation she isn't used to be in.\n\nAt the end of the day, you were definitively not caring about her comfort. You told her straight up, it's too bad you are uncomfortable, I'm staying at the event. I'm not saying you should leave the event right away when she told you, but you could have discussed with her a compromise. Maybe no good comprise could be found, but you didn't seem to have even tried.", "YTA - You are making an awful lot about the dress she wore but from what you say, it looks a lot more like she was uncomfortable because nobody was engaging with her at all. As you were off networking with people you were probably also ignoring her. It\u2019s not any fun being at a party where nobody speaks to you. \n\nI am not saying you ought to have left when she wanted but I think you didn\u2019t have to be networking the entire time and spent some time on your own with your friend. You weren\u2019t on the clock after all and could have balanced things better.", "YTA  - you were rude to your friend and guest. A good friendship trumps 40 minutes of networking.", "Did you explain to her what the party would be like when you initially invited her? Is she an extrovert normally?", "NTA. While it may not have been a work event you were still technically working, jobs like these aren\u2019t 9-5, networking is extremely important in these sectors, you need to build and maintain relationships and reputations too. \n\nYou also warned her beforehand of what she was getting into and gave her the option to change which she chose not to heed. \n\nHonestly I think she\u2019s a major asshole for potentially jeopardising your work reputation, she\u2019s your friend and it was one night, she should of just dealt with it instead of acting like a child.", "NTA - you warned her and she ignored it.", "Nta she\u2019s an adult, you are not her parent.

I would flip it on her and tell her how embarrassing and childlike she\u2019s acting and for the foreseeable future she will no longer be attending these events with you.", "NTA! a: You warned her. b: You really were kinda working. c: Leaving. the party would have been a bit of a snub to the person who had given you the tickets. Sara needs to get over herself.", "NTA. It\u2019s like when people show up in sandals for a hike and you have to remind them this isn\u2019t a regular walk on paved trails of a city park but a trek in the woods with mud, rocks and streams to cross. \u201cOh I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d And five minurptes later they are wining about stones in their sandals and uneven ground. \n\nAlways listen to the people with the experience.", "NTA.\n\n>she was upset by the way I had treated her and that I should have left when she wanted.\n\nI'm sorry... why? If she is that uncomfortable, then the option of her leaving by herself exists. Pretty selfish of her to think that you should have left what was an important work-adjacent event for her.\n\nShe was uncomfortable because she was out of her element and her dress made her stick out like a sore thumb. But the former was something she should have been aware of given the nature of the events, and the latter was a result of her own choice.", "NTA \n\nIt is obvious she is not accustomed to these events. Not being accustomed, she would have been wise taking your advice. Instead she chose to double down and got the treatment you predicted. She then triple downed and demanded you accommodate her because she was foolish enough to not listen. \n\nShe is the AH. She was given chances, chose to ignore experienced advice, and suffered for it. Next time, IF there is a next time, maybe she will listen.", "You cared enough about her to A - invite her, B - explain the expectations for the pre-party and C - offer her choice of any of the more pre-party appropriate dresses from your wardrobe.  \n\nSara did not care for you enough to take your guidance to heart and, despite how it would make you look,wanted you to leave when she predictably felt uncomfortably out of place.\n\nNTA", "I just want to add though - while I\u2019m sure there was judgment, Sara\u2019s behavior probably made it worse than just wearing an inappropriate outfit.\n\nWhen you\u2019re uncomfortable you can appear standoffish. Additionally, it sounds like Sara was standing next to Op the entire time while also choosing not to engage with others. She pulled Op out of 3 separate conversations - how rude!  She was whispering which is also rude and obviously wanted to leave (body language).\n\nAnd, she saw Op\u2019s formal floor length dress, so that should have been enough of a clue.\n\nOp - in the future make sure to only bring people who are comfortable holding their own.", "Yes. I told her most of the party was going to be 60-70+ year olds, the very wealthy/traditional types and they have a very different idea of opera appropriate than her or I do.", "Everybody judges you all the time. I work for the NHS and it\u2019s written into our contracts that we mustn\u2019t bring our employer or the profession into disrepute. This is not a difficult standard for OP\u2019s friend to grasp. It\u2019s inappropriate to \u201clet your hair down\u201d at an event that is effectively black tie, and you are (still) representing your employer.", "Honestly? I hate admitting this but I just don\u2019t have the strongest spine. I knew when I invited her, she originally had plans for Saturday and she got so excited and cleared her day for it\u2026 I just felt like I couldn\u2019t. I probably should have, in hindsight and I know I need to work on it but I have a really hard time saying no.\n\nEditing to add that I do feel like I was very clear on what the party attendees would be like.", ">Did you not already know your friend enough to know that this kind of event was not something that she would enjoy?\n\nShe\u2019s a former theater kid who loves all kinds of live performances; when I originally invited her, she seemed to feel like 90 minutes of my boring stuff was worth free, prime seat tickets. \n\nI didn\u2019t expect her to love the party portion but I thought she thought it was a fair trade off and be able to get through it.", "nyeh, I feel like the friend is old enough to take responsibility for this.  \n\n\nIt feels like those stories where someone goes on a hike and doesn't wear the right shoes despite being told what was involved", "A good friend would also put up with 40 minutes of networking for a good friend and would aim not to embarrass them at work.", "The seeing OP\u2019s formal length dress is the big thing for me. I feel like if you\u2019re the plus one for an event, you should be matching the formality level as the one bringing you along. Especially if your an outsider, you don\u2019t want to be standing out because of the clothes you wear.\n\nIf anything, Sara should have been coordinating with OP before even leaving her home to make sure her outfit would be appropriate", "hmmmm im gonna go with a very light ESH. Your friend was pretty dense and should have known better/gotten the message, but if you knew that despite it not being a work event it would impact your work/your boss you probably should have just opted to go alone/sell the ticket to avoid any awkward interactions.\n\nMixing friends w/ work can get very messy very quickly if your friends arent used to your work environment\n\nEdit: yikes the downvotes, just to be clear I still think the friend is the bigger AH, but I personally would've just not invited my friend if knew the event wasn't their vibe", "I\u2019m actually going with NTA. I\u2019ve accompanied friends in different professional industries to various formal events and basic common sense says to take their lead and not do anything that may reflect poorly on them even if it\u2019s not strictly a \u201cwork\u201d event. If the friend was feeling uncomfortable because of her insistence on wearing the dress, the correct thing for her to do would\u2019ve been to quietly depart without making a fuss. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable to expect another adult to dress appropriately for the setting, especially if they had fair warning. \n\nI will say, however, that I think OP was a little too nice. I would\u2019ve straight up told the friend that her outfit was unacceptable for the evening and, unfortunately, I wouldn\u2019t be able to bring her along if she didn\u2019t change. The ball still would\u2019ve been in the friend\u2019s court on whether or not to go but being direct is often the best way to prevent situations like this from even occurring.", "I disagree, it sounds like OP gave Sara all the information she needed to make an informed decision about the event, including telling her the dress might be an issue. Sara\u2019s an adult who is presumably capable of understanding that her options are \u201cgo to this event that\u2019s outside her comfort zone and act polite and nice anyway\u201d or \u201copt out and let OP take someone else\u201d. A friend who opts for the 3rd \u201cgo anyway and sulk the whole time\u201d option is being childish and rude. OP is def NTA", "NTA. You warned her re: outfit in advance and she knew this was a work-related event so she should have expected that her comfort would not be your #1 priority. \n\nHonestly what is the deal with all of these \u201cfriends\u201d of AITA writers who tell their friends they are the AH? It is one thing if you are a part of the conflict but when it is someone else who has heard about it and offers such a dumba** opinion I just can\u2019t believe it.", "NTA.\n\nHowever, you should have told her when you extended the invitation what she should wear, not as you were getting dressed.", "NTA you we\u2019re clear since the beginning but, none of you thought about just putting the more traditional dress in a bag, you put it in your car and if anything happens well she can change? Don\u2019t mean to sound mean or anything, I\u2019m just curious lol.", "Let the friend know you do care about her comfort and that you did express your concerns. You even offered her a dress, but Sara made the decision it to change, even though she saw you were wearing a more formal event. You did care, but she ultimately made the decision. When you were ultimately proven correct, it was unfair of her to ask you to jeopardize the relationships you were making at a work adjacent event", "You warned her, it's her own moronic fault, dump her as a friend and go no contact permanently, sheesh \ud83d\ude44", "ESH \n\nThis could have been avoided by insisting her to match your formality or her skipping the party and just attending the opera. You left her off the hook and it came back to bite you both.\n\nShe didn't understand prior to the event what it was about, and so it was your job as a host to make her understand and care for her wellbeing. \n\nShe should have understood that this is a networking event and not something you buy your tickets and greet a couple of people you happen to meet there by chance. She should have taken your hint of the dress, she should have left you to network in peace with a smile on her face, and she should have taken the L and went to wait you in the bar.", "awww I thought she was your fiance. i was like, yessssss a story about 2 beautiful femmes, one is classy and the other sassy.", "YTA why do you hang out with freaks who other people because they wear something appropriate and cute?

Maybe be a good friend and don't even bring them to some weirdo event like that.\n\nEspecially since it's a work event why would you even put your friends in a situation they can't leave with a bunch of weirdos. Should've said sit this one out. At the very least have some empathy jfc. \"OH woah is me I have to deal with my friends emotions\". It sounds like it was a shitty time for her regardless. Sounds like anyone who can't get along with \"traditional\" art creeps would have a shite time", "Did you tell her what to wear beforehand or just think it but not actually tell her that her wardrobe choice was inappropriate?", "NTA.

Sarah is an asshole and so is your mutual friend.", "NTA", "NTA.", "NTA you tried to warn her and you offered other more reasonable wardrobe options.", "NTA - You gave plenty of warning, and any reasonably intelligent person would have changed. I probably would have brought an extra dress for her to change into just to cover my bases. But that\u2019s assuming you\u2019re taking your own car. You have more reason to be upset with her for possibly damaging your reputation.", "NTA and your friend is a whiny brat. Next time maybe she will listen to your helpful suggestion.", "NTA.\n\nYou informed her beforehand about the social situation and dress expectations at the pre-party, and gave her a convenient out when she told you she was uncomfortable (entirely her fault).\n\nShe's an adult and could have left at any time.", "NTA. Your friend sounds pretty self absorbed.", "Too bad she missed the clear message that the dress was inappropriate for the event. IF you invite her to another, she should follow your lead with regard to level and style of appropriate dress.\n\nNTA.\n\nThese vents can be so much fun. I hope your friend can learn from her mistake and \"rise to the occasion\" should she get another invitation in the future.", "NTA. She was warned, and image is a big thing in that line of work. If you left early, then you would have appeared rude, and that influences potential clients or employers and their opinions of you. She should have listened and needs to understand that your job is important to you. A true friend would have either changed or stopped asking you to leave. As for the friend trying to guilt you, they need to stay out of it. You are in a position where your reputation is important,  and you need to be mindful of it. Friends that don't mind making you look bad are not true friends.", "NTA\n\nMy greatest issue with society's growth into the world of \"it makes me feel uncomfortable and my feeling count too\" is this:  as much as it has meant many people have been freeing themselves of families, friendships, behaviors and situations which are abusive, toxic and unhealthy ... and I applaud our awareness ... it's also taken too far, sometimes into selfishness.\n\nThe house rule on being a +1 is that the actual invitees rules apply. As a tag along, you don't get to dictate. The respectful behavior would be to dress appropriately, behave appropriately and to support the person you are with. Unless there is a serious problem, your job, as a +1 is to enjoy as best you can and play wing.\n\nOr have we abandoned respectful etiquette?", "NTA!

NTA!\nWhat is wrong with people like this.", "NTA, you warned her and you suggested places for her to go while you would continue the event. I understand that maybe she wasn't aware of how much of an impact her outfit would have (and it's also stupid conservative people who shouldn't be able to make other people feel bad about what they wear), but it's not like you were punishing her for misjudging the situation afterwards. You simply couldn't leave. So stand your ground.", "NTA at all. You gave her plenty of warning. I can\u2019t imagine being so indifferent when you were telling her her outfit may not be appropriate.

You gave her fair warning, and she chose to not listen.", "NTA at all. She didn't respect you enough to dress appropriately, she refused to change when you offered her options, and when she realized you were right, she wanted YOU to leave the event, instead of just leaving on her own. You weren't comfortable with how she was dressed, but you're both adults and you left it to her to manage herself. She wanted to stand out and she did. If she was embarrassed later, that was only the consequences of her own choices, one of which was blowing you off when you told her she wasn't dressed for the occasion. She didn't care about your comfort or your job. \n\nNow you know, you can't bring just anyone with you to these things. They have to understand they reflect on you and you reflect on your boss. One too many inappropriate dresses worn by your guests, and you stop getting invites at all. Your friends need to back off, since they don't seem to understand that you don't stop being your boss' representative just because you're not in the office.", "Definitely not the asshole.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou warned her about it and even offered her to wear one of your dresses. It's her faul for not listening to you. You didn't want to leave and you shouldn't have to, because she knew that her outfit wasn't matching the theme but still decided to wear it.", "NTA and I\u2019d she was so uncomfortable, after being properly warned that her dress would cause this, she could of taken an Uber or something home. She caused this and it\u2019s not like you didn\u2019t warn her. She mad at herself for not heeding that warning and for you not dropping what you were doing to leave, so she\u2019s going to play victim and take it out on you.", "NTA.  Your friend clearly didn't give a damn about your own comfort, and I think you should start talking about that when this issue is raised with you.", "Don\u2019t feel bad at all\nYou gave her ample warning\nIt\u2019s totally her fault", "NTA - Sara is a self centered, bad friend. She ignored good advice given with positive intent, and then took it out on you when she realized she should have followed it. She could have left the event as you suggested.\n\nDon't invite her out again. She's shown you who she really is, now believe her.\n\nIf you've explained all this to your mutual friend as well, I'd tell them that you're going to distance yourself from them for participating in this drama and pushing you to feel guilty about making reasonable decisions in your own best interest.", "NTA but this party sounds awful, these \"upper crust\" posh types are assholes", "NTA. She\u2019s mad that she didn\u2019t listen to you.", "NTA. You could\u2019ve been a little kinder maybe. But you invited her to an event and gave her reasonable advice and options, which she ignored. At that point she needs to live with her choices, or as you offered, remove herself from the uncomfortable situation she put herself in. Being a grown up means being responsible for your own actions and choices.", "NTA", "NTA- Uncomfortable and 'affects professional reputation and opportunities' are hardly equivalent, your friend needs to mature a little.", "Friendship is a two way street, op showed they cared by informing friend of appropriate dress. Then friend decided since they were not happy and op needed to accommodate them.  Friend was the one who first broke accomodations, op is not the ah. Ditch the friend till they can learn better manners.", "NTA. Why the hell should you leave because she was an idiot? You warned her, offered a different option so she wouldn\u2019t stand out, she chose to ignore it. It\u2019s on her. Demanding you leave is just adding to the AHness.", "NTA you told her not to wear the bright pink short dress. And offered to let her pick one of yours out. Plus even if you were not officially working she also knew how important staying was to you and your Job security \n\nShe sounds like a spoiled child frankly.", "NTA. However, you should\u2019ve told her there was a dress code and that while the dress she chose looked great, it wasn\u2019t appropriate for the event and went against dress code.", "I\u2019m not sure why she wouldn\u2019t have just asked about dress code to begin with. Anytime I\u2019m doing something out of the ordinary where my presence reflects on someone else, I make damn sure I know the dress code", "I've spent a day and a half stranded in an airport, and \"friend\" can't fake a good time for a couple hours.\n\nNTA", "There was a similar post on here not long ago where the OP often invited her friend to work events. Friend only went because there was always an open bar/free food and she wanted to party. Every time the friend ended up wasted and acted loud and inappropriately despite knowing these were important work events for OP's career. Then the friend got angry when OP stopped inviting her after she continually refused to limit her alcohol intake and act appropriately. Friends like these would potentially risk your career for their own enjoyment aren't truly friends and deserved to be kicked to the curb.", "OMG. I Literalolled at the Devil Wears Prada friends comment! So fitting!", "Upvotes for anyone who can drop Mae West into a comment. What an icon she was.", "No, it never crossed my mind. That would have been smart though", "> She should have understood that this is a networking event and not something you buy your tickets and greet a couple of people you happen to meet there by chance. She should have taken your hint of the dress, she should have left you to network in peace with a smile on her face, and she should have taken the L and went to wait you in the bar.\n\nSounds to me like this is Sara's fault and not OP's fault, considering she did explain all these things. Not sure why you say E S H.", "Weirdo event? Good sir the opera has been active in the arts for centuries. And the general \u201ccrowd\u201d that attends opera is the older generation.", ">You are making an awful lot about the dress she wore but from what you say, it looks a lot more like she was uncomfortable because nobody was engaging with her at all.\n\n\n\nSo Op was supposed to force the rich, traditional, older folks to engage with her friend? \n\n\n>You weren\u2019t on the clock after all and could have balanced things better.\n\n\nSo a networking event is the time we should take time out to entertain our adult friends? There was a bar, if I was the friend and I wasn't having fun at the event, I would have found a bar, found a way to entertain myself... Anything to not inconvenience the person who kindly invited me.", ">At the end of the day, you were definitively not caring about her comfort. \n\n\nIf Op cared about her comfort, so? She should leave? \n\n\n>>You told her straight up, it's too bad you are uncomfortable, I'm staying at the event\n\n\nWhich was why she attended, isn't it? \n\n\n\n>>Maybe no good comprise could be found, but you didn't seem to have even tried.\n\n\nSo no good compromise could have been found but maybe Op could have left or acted miserable in support?", "NTA, the expectations of OP and Sara were very different but acceptance of the invite means that going thru whatever the event was or leaving alone if not to expectations. Sara could have told OP that she was leaving as it was not to her taste and left by calling a cab. Not everything has to be liked by everybody. Instead Sara wants to force OP to leave with her and then friend talking about not caring(Could have picked Sara up) is too much entitlement", "Now you know, you can't bring just anyone with you to these things.", "[removed]", "[removed]", "She didn't understand prior to the event what it was about, and so it was your job as a host to make her understand and care for her wellbeing.", "This is the difference between very young people and people with a lot more life experience: the younger set will continue giving the friend more and more chances, especially if set upon by mutual friends, who, miraculously, all and always take the side of the friend with no boundaries. People after, say, 40? Once. You do it to us *once* and you never get invited again. You don't get any talking-to, it's pointless. If you are the kind of person who is capable of behaving this way at all, you will not change your behavior just because you've been asked to.", "Don\u2019t be ridiculous, she obviously can\u2019t make them speak to her. \n\nThis wasn\u2019t a work event though, she could easily have made time to speak to the person she brought with her, and still manage to network with attendees.", "I don't think that's lacking a spine; I think cancelling on her at the last minute would have been an AH move. But it sounds like you tried to explain the situation to her and considered her feelings (letting her wear her own dress because that's what she wanted to do). You're NTA in this situation.", "Had Sara been to the Famous Opera House before? How was she during/about the performance?\n\nYou couldn't have said more about her dress, she already thought you didn't want her to outshine you, and she would have lots of attention, and she could have had fun if she had brought some personality with the dress.\n\nUpvote for you :)", ">She should leave?  \n>  \n>Op could have left or acted miserable in support?\n\nNever said that, but good strawman. Caring about your friend doesn't equal doing 100% as they wish. But ignoring them and doing 100% what you want is not caring.\n\n>Which was why she attended, isn't it?\n\nWell she attended the event with a friend. Event and friend was the plan.\n\n>So no good compromise could have been found\n\nWhy no good compromise could have been found? Seem like the friend ask her to leave, and she said no. Not much compromise on both side.", "Completely agree! Since she didn\u2019t attempt to coordinate or ask what style of clothing to wear she should have taken OP up on the offer to pick one of OP\u2019s dresses. It\u2019s not like the opera is an event that you\u2019d think to tell someone \u201cdon\u2019t wear a club dress\u201d over since it\u2019s viewed as a more formal attire kind of occasion even if you\u2019ve never been to the opera. I haven\u2019t been, but I\u2019ve seen movies and shows and have always assumed it\u2019s a formal attire kind of event. Same for the ballet. If I was going with a friend as someone who has never been I would assume that I should dress formally and in something that isn\u2019t short. Maybe around or just above the knees would seem appropriate potentially, but a short club style dress absolutely wouldn\u2019t in my mind. It wouldn\u2019t cross my mind to tell someone not to dress for the club.\n\nOP was right, it was her friend\u2019s problem that she was uncomfortable after not listening to OP or taking her up on the offer to borrow a more formal gown.", "That\u2019s pretty tough to disinvite a friend who\u2019s already at your house and old enough to decide whether she can handle wearing a youthful outfit at a stiff event.", ">Had Sara been to the Famous Opera House before? How was she during/about the performance?\n\nShe has been there for a few performances before; we went last year together for Tosca on our own dime. \n\nShe did seem to really enjoy the performance but she didn\u2019t want to talk to me after so I couldn\u2019t confirm.", "Except clearly she *couldn\u2019t* handle it", "Not OP\u2019s fault, and OP wasn\u2019t required to leave a work-related event when it was the friend\u2019s fault and the friend could\u2019ve gone to the bar."]}
