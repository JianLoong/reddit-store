My boss and I do not have the same tastes in art - he\u2019s an older, very traditional guy and that reflects in the events I get invited to/the people that I\u2019m interacting with at these events.\n\nWe have a world famous opera in our city and I was gifted two tickets to the opera last weekend, with an invitation to attend a pre show cocktail party in a private area. This was not a work event for me but still a networking opportunity and a gift from my boss\u2019s personal friend.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 was visiting family so I invited my friend Sara to join me. She arrived at my house Saturday afternoon to get ready with me. She had brought a dress to wear that I didn\u2019t think she should. It was very pretty but more like a club dress than an event dress, bright pink and very short. And our opera is known for a \u201cno dress code, just be fabulous\u201d approach so it was fine for the venue itself but I knew the pre party was going to be an older, more \u201ctraditional opera dress\u201d crowd (I wore a deep green floor length dress, for reference). I offered her the option of choosing something out of my closet and told her that I thought she might be uncomfortable at the party because of the type of group they were but she wanted to wear that dress so I didn\u2019t push it.\n\nAt the party, most of the attendees didn\u2019t seem interested in engaging with her and while outwardly polite, it did feel like they were equally uncomfortable with her presence as she was being there. She stayed next to me the whole time which was fine but she was sullen and kept grabbing my arm to whisper in my ear that we should leave. \n\nAfter the 3rd time Sara pulled me out of a conversation and told me she wanted us to leave the party, I got irritated and told her it was too damn bad that she was uncomfortable, I warned her. There\u2019s two bars out in the public area, she could go hang out there and I\u2019d join her in an hour for the show but I couldn\u2019t leave yet without looking bad. I might not have been \u201cworking\u201d but I accepted the invitation and now my behavior here reflects on my boss and that ultimately affects my job regardless of it not being officially work.\n\nSara stayed at the party instead and eventually it was over and we attended the show. She didn\u2019t speak to me at all on the drive home and texted me after I dropped her off that she was upset by the way I had treated her and that I should have left when she wanted. I think that\u2019s unfair, I talk about my job all the time and she knows very well what expectations are placed on me at these events and how I am expected to act. I tried to tell her but obviously I wasn\u2019t going to force her to change?

That being I don\u2019t know the extent of the warning given, perhaps a bit more detailed explanation should be given next time to ensure the individual in question knows exactly what might occur. Sometimes communicating a warning doesn\u2019t match the level of internal concern due to not wanting to insult the person resulting in them not thinking too much about it and it may be possible that was the case.

Sara came as your *guest* to what she knew was a career-related function for you. She insisted on dressing inappropriately when advised against it, and her repeated demands that you leave because she was as uncomfortable as you told her she would be were immature and self-absorbed. So was her refusal to retreat to an area where she might be more comfortable and let you finish working the room.

It is not your fault that she didn't take your advice. Even though it \"technically\" wasn't a work even, your attendance and behavior does affect your work and your career. Her behavior jeapordized your career - first with her choice of attire, then her sullen attitude. She should have left quietly as you had already explained that you could not for professional reasons.\n\nIf she's too immature and selfish to understand that, too bad. You now know not to invite her to future work-related events.

You told her and offered to let her wear one of your dresses. If she was that uncomfortable, surely she could have gotten an Uber/Lyft/cab home?", "NTA. Dress codes can be quite obtuse. I occasionally go to events that are easy for men, it's black tie. But what is the dress code for women? As you have deduced,  it depends on formality of the event and audience. I usually call and ask, is it long dress, cocktail length dress or posh trousers and smart jacket? We work it out beforehand.  It's embarrassing to be dressed differently  and that's without the faux pas of wearing a clubbing dress. \n\nI'm not surprised Sara felt uncomfortable but she didn't listen  and misjudged her attire. The immediate compromise would have been for her to go to the other bar and leave you to your networking. Sulking and trying to ruin your event was silly.", "The fact you\u2019re even asking this question shows you\u2019re a kind, empathetic person. Sara did a dumb thing that she was warned against. Rather childish move on her part. \n\nYour job sounds amazing and I can\u2019t imagine how delightful it must be to be exposed to art and different people like that.\n\nNTA", "Is Sara an adult? Than this is on her. Learning the appropriate outfits for different social settings is part of  becoming an adult. We don't always get it right when we first set out in life, but we learn through mistakes.

Your NTA for not leaving when she wanted too, she could have waited in the bar", "NTA. \n\nI think it is weird that people treated her in a way that even you noticed that they were \"uncomfortable\" with her presence because of what she was wearing, and not like a group of people I'd want to be around. \n\nHowever, it was a work event for you, and if people were just cold but not rude, then I agree you shouldn't have left just for her. Especially because she could have gone to the open bars and like many people, waited for the opera to start and had a seat and a drink and looked at her phone. She didn't need you to leave with her in order to get somewhere safe, or for a ride, etc, so she had full autonomy to step out of the party and still be in a safe environment. \n\nIt doesn't really matter that you told her she wasn't dressed exactly right, she wasn't wearing sweats or anything like that, and she is also an adult who should understand this was a work function for you and she needed to make it work or sit and wait for you.", "NTA, it's the opera and a work event. She should have dressed appropriately and known that you had professional mingling to do.", "NTA, some people don't have any sense of propriety. Frankly seeing her at your house would have been enough for me to cancel her ticket and tell her to head home or to a bar where it might be appropriate. \n\nThe onus is on the guest of an event to conform to the rules, not on the event to make exceptions.", "It could also be that your boss gifted you these tickets to, I don\u2019t know, enjoy and let your hair down. Not everything is about work and those people at the party didn\u2019t know who got you the tickets. So it didn\u2019t reflect on your job or your boss in any way. That you chose to network is fine, and as long as Sara knew that, you did nothing wrong. But maybe you could have made some time, just you and her, to have a little fun and crack some jokes. NAH", "NTA. F*ck around and find out. Wear an inappropriate dress and be uncomfortable. You\u2019re not her babysitter and this was through a work connection.", "INFO: why didn\u2019t you cancel her invitation when she was clearly not willing to dress appropriately for your work event?\n\nIt will have reflected badly that the two of you were there together, and that she was sulking and being rude the whole time. \n\nIt sounds like you weren\u2019t clear enough that her decisions & behaviour weren\u2019t acceptable for the event, and would result in her losing her invitation. \n\nDo you think you were sufficiently clear?", "ESH. im sorry, maybe im just crazy, but why would you invite your friend to a networking event if you were just going to ignore them the whole time?  why wouldnt you tell her that her outfit was inappropriate for the event and tell her that if she can't dress appropriately, her invitation would be revoked? Did you not already know your friend enough to know that this kind of event was not something that she would enjoy? it sounds like she's not the kind of person who would mesh well with that kind of event in the first place, so inviting her to begin with was a mistake. \n\nLike no, you shouldnt have left when she wanted, but at the same time, why would you put either one of you in this position in the first place?", "NAH.\n\nYou warn her about the dress, you told her that it was important for you to stay here and she's an adult. She wasn't in danger or having a mental episode, she's a big girl that can leave the party and find a way to occupy herself for what I would expect is 1 hour-30min? \n\nAt the same time, it wasn't a work event, you invited her as your friend and you kind of just brushed her off. Maybe I'm wrong, but I don't think your friend is used to this type of event and she just didn't know what your warning was implying. You can't really blame her really thrust you anymore, especially in situation she isn't used to be in.\n\nAt the end of the day, you were definitively not caring about her comfort. You told her straight up, it's too bad you are uncomfortable, I'm staying at the event. I'm not saying you should leave the event right away when she told you, but you could have discussed with her a compromise. Maybe no good comprise could be found, but you didn't seem to have even tried.", "YTA - You are making an awful lot about the dress she wore but from what you say, it looks a lot more like she was uncomfortable because nobody was engaging with her at all. As you were off networking with people you were probably also ignoring her. It\u2019s not any fun being at a party where nobody speaks to you. \n\nI am not saying you ought to have left when she wanted but I think you didn\u2019t have to be networking the entire time and spent some time on your own with your friend. You weren\u2019t on the clock after all and could have balanced things better.", "YTA  - you were rude to your friend and guest. A good friendship trumps 40 minutes of networking.", "Did you explain to her what the party would be like when you initially invited her? Is she an extrovert normally?", "NTA. While it may not have been a work event you were still technically working, jobs like these aren\u2019t 9-5, networking is extremely important in these sectors, you need to build and maintain relationships and reputations too. \n\nYou also warned her beforehand of what she was getting into and gave her the option to change which she chose not to heed. \n\nHonestly I think she\u2019s a major asshole for potentially jeopardising your work reputation, she\u2019s your friend and it was one night, she should of just dealt with it instead of acting like a child.", "NTA - you warned her and she ignored it.", "Nta she\u2019s an adult, you are not her parent. Work trumps her inability to be alone. Don\u2019t invite her out again if she doesn\u2019t understand why you couldn\u2019t leave.", "NTA you warned her prior and she still chose to wear something inappropriate for the event. I would flip it on her and tell her how embarrassing and childlike she\u2019s acting and for the foreseeable future she will no longer be attending these events with you.", "NTA! a: You warned her. b: You really were kinda working. c: Leaving. the party would have been a bit of a snub to the person who had given you the tickets. Sara needs to get over herself.", "NTA. It\u2019s like when people show up in sandals for a hike and you have to remind them this isn\u2019t a regular walk on paved trails of a city park but a trek in the woods with mud, rocks and streams to cross. \u201cOh I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d And five minurptes later they are wining about stones in their sandals and uneven ground. \n\nAlways listen to the people with the experience.", "NTA.\n\n>she was upset by the way I had treated her and that I should have left when she wanted.\n\nI'm sorry... why? If she is that uncomfortable, then the option of her leaving by herself exists. Pretty selfish of her to think that you should have left what was an important work-adjacent event for her.\n\nShe was uncomfortable because she was out of her element and her dress made her stick out like a sore thumb. But the former was something she should have been aware of given the nature of the events, and the latter was a result of her own choice.", "NTA \n\nIt is obvious she is not accustomed to these events. Not being accustomed, she would have been wise taking your advice. Instead she chose to double down and got the treatment you predicted. She then triple downed and demanded you accommodate her because she was foolish enough to not listen. \n\nShe is the AH. She was given chances, chose to ignore experienced advice, and suffered for it. Next time, IF there is a next time, maybe she will listen.", "You cared enough about her to A - invite her, B - explain the expectations for the pre-party and C - offer her choice of any of the more pre-party appropriate dresses from your wardrobe.  \n\nSara did not care for you enough to take your guidance to heart and, despite how it would make you look,wanted you to leave when she predictably felt uncomfortably out of place.\n\nNTA", "I just want to add though - while I\u2019m sure there was judgment, Sara\u2019s behavior probably made it worse than just wearing an inappropriate outfit.\n\nWhen you\u2019re uncomfortable you can appear standoffish. Additionally, it sounds like Sara was standing next to Op the entire time while also choosing not to engage with others. She pulled Op out of 3 separate conversations - how rude!  She was whispering which is also rude and obviously wanted to leave (body language).\n\nAnd, she saw Op\u2019s formal floor length dress, so that should have been enough of a clue.\n\nOp - in the future make sure to only bring people who are comfortable holding their own.", "Yes. I told her most of the party was going to be 60-70+ year olds, the very wealthy/traditional types and they have a very different idea of opera appropriate than her or I do.", "Everybody judges you all the time. I work for the NHS and it\u2019s written into our contracts that we mustn\u2019t bring our employer or the profession into disrepute. This is not a difficult standard for OP\u2019s friend to grasp. It\u2019s inappropriate to \u201clet your hair down\u201d at an event that is effectively black tie, and you are (still) representing your employer.", "Honestly? I hate admitting this but I just don\u2019t have the strongest spine. I knew when I invited her, she originally had plans for Saturday and she got so excited and cleared her day for it\u2026 I just felt like I couldn\u2019t. I probably should have, in hindsight and I know I need to work on it but I have a really hard time saying no.\n\nEditing to add that I do feel like I was very clear on what the party attendees would be like.", ">Did you not already know your friend enough to know that this kind of event was not something that she would enjoy?\n\nShe\u2019s a former theater kid who loves all kinds of live performances; when I originally invited her, she seemed to feel like 90 minutes of my boring stuff was worth free, prime seat tickets. \n\nI didn\u2019t expect her to love the party portion but I thought she thought it was a fair trade off and be able to get through it.", "nyeh, I feel like the friend is old enough to take responsibility for this.  \n\n\nIt feels like those stories where someone goes on a hike and doesn't wear the right shoes despite being told what was involved", "A good friend would also put up with 40 minutes of networking for a good friend and would aim not to embarrass them at work.", "The seeing OP\u2019s formal length dress is the big thing for me. I feel like if you\u2019re the plus one for an event, you should be matching the formality level as the one bringing you along. Especially if your an outsider, you don\u2019t want to be standing out because of the clothes you wear.\n\nIf anything, Sara should have been coordinating with OP before even leaving her home to make sure her outfit would be appropriate", "hmmmm im gonna go with a very light ESH. Your friend was pretty dense and should have known better/gotten the message, but if you knew that despite it not being a work event it would impact your work/your boss you probably should have just opted to go alone/sell the ticket to avoid any awkward interactions. \n\nMixing friends w/ work can get very messy very quickly if your friends arent used to your work environment", "I\u2019m actually going with NTA. I\u2019ve accompanied friends in different professional industries to various formal events and basic common sense says to take their lead and not do anything that may reflect poorly on them even if it\u2019s not strictly a \u201cwork\u201d event. If the friend was feeling uncomfortable because of her insistence on wearing the dress, the correct thing for her to do would\u2019ve been to quietly depart without making a fuss. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable to expect another adult to dress appropriately for the setting, especially if they had fair warning. \n\nI will say, however, that I think OP was a little too nice. I would\u2019ve straight up told the friend that her outfit was unacceptable for the evening and, unfortunately, I wouldn\u2019t be able to bring her along if she didn\u2019t change. The ball still would\u2019ve been in the friend\u2019s court on whether or not to go but being direct is often the best way to prevent situations like this from even occurring.", "I disagree, it sounds like OP gave Sara all the information she needed to make an informed decision about the event, including telling her the dress might be an issue. Sara\u2019s an adult who is presumably capable of understanding that her options are \u201cgo to this event that\u2019s outside her comfort zone and act polite and nice anyway\u201d or \u201copt out and let OP take someone else\u201d. A friend who opts for the 3rd \u201cgo anyway and sulk the whole time\u201d option is being childish and rude. OP is def NTA"]}
