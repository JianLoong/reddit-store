This was not a work event for me but still a networking opportunity and a gift from my boss\u2019s personal friend.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 was visiting family so I invited my friend Sara to join me. She arrived at my house Saturday afternoon to get ready with me. She had brought a dress to wear that I didn\u2019t think she should. It was very pretty but more like a club dress than an event dress, bright pink and very short. And our opera is known for a \u201cno dress code, just be fabulous\u201d approach so it was fine for the venue itself but I knew the pre party was going to be an older, more \u201ctraditional opera dress\u201d crowd (I wore a deep green floor length dress, for reference). I offered her the option of choosing something out of my closet and told her that I thought she might be uncomfortable at the party because of the type of group they were but she wanted to wear that dress so I didn\u2019t push it.\n\nAt the party, most of the attendees didn\u2019t seem interested in engaging with her and while outwardly polite, it did feel like they were equally uncomfortable with her presence as she was being there. She stayed next to me the whole time which was fine but she was sullen and kept grabbing my arm to whisper in my ear that we should leave. \n\nAfter the 3rd time Sara pulled me out of a conversation and told me she wanted us to leave the party, I got irritated and told her it was too damn bad that she was uncomfortable, I warned her. There\u2019s two bars out in the public area, she could go hang out there and I\u2019d join her in an hour for the show but I couldn\u2019t leave yet without looking bad. I might not have been \u201cworking\u201d but I accepted the invitation and now my behavior here reflects on my boss and that ultimately affects my job regardless of it not being officially work.\n\nSara stayed at the party instead and eventually it was over and we attended the show. She didn\u2019t speak to me at all on the drive home and texted me after I dropped her off that she was upset by the way I had treated her and that I should have left when she wanted. I think that\u2019s unfair, I talk about my job all the time and she knows very well what expectations are placed on me at these events and how I am expected to act. I tried to tell her but obviously I wasn\u2019t going to force her to change? But she\u2019s still mad and a mutual friend is guilting me for \u201cnot caring\u201d about Sara\u2019s comfort and im starting to feel a little bad and idk, AITA?\n\n\nEdit to address all the \u201cwhy didn\u2019t she get an Uber\u201d questions - sorry to be unclear, she wanted to leave *the party* and go to our seats or out to the public areas.

Sara came as your *guest* to what she knew was a career-related function for you. She insisted on dressing inappropriately when advised against it, and her repeated demands that you leave because she was as uncomfortable as you told her she would be were immature and self-absorbed. So was her refusal to retreat to an area where she might be more comfortable and let you finish working the room.

Her behavior jeapordized your career - first with her choice of attire, then her sullen attitude. She should have left quietly as you had already explained that you could not for professional reasons.\n\nIf she's too immature and selfish to understand that, too bad.

I occasionally go to events that are easy for men, it's black tie. But what is the dress code for women? As you have deduced,  it depends on formality of the event and audience. I usually call and ask, is it long dress, cocktail length dress or posh trousers and smart jacket? We work it out beforehand.  It's embarrassing to be dressed differently  and that's without the faux pas of wearing a clubbing dress. \n\nI'm not surprised Sara felt uncomfortable but she didn't listen  and misjudged her attire. The immediate compromise would have been for her to go to the other bar and leave you to your networking. Sulking and trying to ruin your event was silly.", "The fact you\u2019re even asking this question shows you\u2019re a kind, empathetic person. Sara did a dumb thing that she was warned against.

Than this is on her. Learning the appropriate outfits for different social settings is part of  becoming an adult.

Especially because she could have gone to the open bars and like many people, waited for the opera to start and had a seat and a drink and looked at her phone. She didn't need you to leave with her in order to get somewhere safe, or for a ride, etc, so she had full autonomy to step out of the party and still be in a safe environment. \n\nIt doesn't really matter that you told her she wasn't dressed exactly right, she wasn't wearing sweats or anything like that, and she is also an adult who should understand this was a work function for you and she needed to make it work or sit and wait for you.", "NTA, it's the opera and a work event. She should have dressed appropriately and known that you had professional mingling to do.", "NTA, some people don't have any sense of propriety. Frankly seeing her at your house would have been enough for me to cancel her ticket and tell her to head home or to a bar where it might be appropriate. \n\nThe onus is on the guest of an event to conform to the rules, not on the event to make exceptions.", "It could also be that your boss gifted you these tickets to, I don\u2019t know, enjoy and let your hair down. Not everything is about work and those people at the party didn\u2019t know who got you the tickets. So it didn\u2019t reflect on your job or your boss in any way. That you chose to network is fine, and as long as Sara knew that, you did nothing wrong. But maybe you could have made some time, just you and her, to have a little fun and crack some jokes. NAH", "NTA. F*ck around and find out. Wear an inappropriate dress and be uncomfortable. You\u2019re not her babysitter and this was through a work connection.", "INFO: why didn\u2019t you cancel her invitation when she was clearly not willing to dress appropriately for your work event?\n\nIt will have reflected badly that the two of you were there together, and that she was sulking and being rude the whole time. \n\nIt sounds like you weren\u2019t clear enough that her decisions & behaviour weren\u2019t acceptable for the event, and would result in her losing her invitation. \n\nDo you think you were sufficiently clear?", "ESH. im sorry, maybe im just crazy, but why would you invite your friend to a networking event if you were just going to ignore them the whole time?  why wouldnt you tell her that her outfit was inappropriate for the event and tell her that if she can't dress appropriately, her invitation would be revoked? Did you not already know your friend enough to know that this kind of event was not something that she would enjoy? it sounds like she's not the kind of person who would mesh well with that kind of event in the first place, so inviting her to begin with was a mistake. \n\nLike no, you shouldnt have left when she wanted, but at the same time, why would you put either one of you in this position in the first place?", "NAH.\n\nYou warn her about the dress, you told her that it was important for you to stay here and she's an adult. She wasn't in danger or having a mental episode, she's a big girl that can leave the party and find a way to occupy herself for what I would expect is 1 hour-30min? \n\nAt the same time, it wasn't a work event, you invited her as your friend and you kind of just brushed her off. Maybe I'm wrong, but I don't think your friend is used to this type of event and she just didn't know what your warning was implying. You can't really blame her really thrust you anymore, especially in situation she isn't used to be in.\n\nAt the end of the day, you were definitively not caring about her comfort. You told her straight up, it's too bad you are uncomfortable, I'm staying at the event. I'm not saying you should leave the event right away when she told you, but you could have discussed with her a compromise. Maybe no good comprise could be found, but you didn't seem to have even tried.", "YTA - You are making an awful lot about the dress she wore but from what you say, it looks a lot more like she was uncomfortable because nobody was engaging with her at all. As you were off networking with people you were probably also ignoring her. It\u2019s not any fun being at a party where nobody speaks to you. \n\nI am not saying you ought to have left when she wanted but I think you didn\u2019t have to be networking the entire time and spent some time on your own with your friend. You weren\u2019t on the clock after all and could have balanced things better.", "YTA  - you were rude to your friend and guest. A good friendship trumps 40 minutes of networking.", "Did you explain to her what the party would be like when you initially invited her? Is she an extrovert normally?", "NTA. While it may not have been a work event you were still technically working, jobs like these aren\u2019t 9-5, networking is extremely important in these sectors, you need to build and maintain relationships and reputations too. \n\nYou also warned her beforehand of what she was getting into and gave her the option to change which she chose not to heed. \n\nHonestly I think she\u2019s a major asshole for potentially jeopardising your work reputation, she\u2019s your friend and it was one night, she should of just dealt with it instead of acting like a child.", "NTA - you warned her and she ignored it.", "Nta she\u2019s an adult, you are not her parent.

I would flip it on her and tell her how embarrassing and childlike she\u2019s acting and for the foreseeable future she will no longer be attending these events with you.", "NTA! a: You warned her. b: You really were kinda working. c: Leaving. the party would have been a bit of a snub to the person who had given you the tickets. Sara needs to get over herself.", "NTA. It\u2019s like when people show up in sandals for a hike and you have to remind them this isn\u2019t a regular walk on paved trails of a city park but a trek in the woods with mud, rocks and streams to cross. \u201cOh I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d And five minurptes later they are wining about stones in their sandals and uneven ground. \n\nAlways listen to the people with the experience.", "NTA.\n\n>she was upset by the way I had treated her and that I should have left when she wanted.\n\nI'm sorry... why? If she is that uncomfortable, then the option of her leaving by herself exists. Pretty selfish of her to think that you should have left what was an important work-adjacent event for her.\n\nShe was uncomfortable because she was out of her element and her dress made her stick out like a sore thumb. But the former was something she should have been aware of given the nature of the events, and the latter was a result of her own choice.", "NTA \n\nIt is obvious she is not accustomed to these events. Not being accustomed, she would have been wise taking your advice. Instead she chose to double down and got the treatment you predicted. She then triple downed and demanded you accommodate her because she was foolish enough to not listen. \n\nShe is the AH. She was given chances, chose to ignore experienced advice, and suffered for it. Next time, IF there is a next time, maybe she will listen.", "You cared enough about her to A - invite her, B - explain the expectations for the pre-party and C - offer her choice of any of the more pre-party appropriate dresses from your wardrobe.  \n\nSara did not care for you enough to take your guidance to heart and, despite how it would make you look,wanted you to leave when she predictably felt uncomfortably out of place.\n\nNTA", "I just want to add though - while I\u2019m sure there was judgment, Sara\u2019s behavior probably made it worse than just wearing an inappropriate outfit.\n\nWhen you\u2019re uncomfortable you can appear standoffish. Additionally, it sounds like Sara was standing next to Op the entire time while also choosing not to engage with others. She pulled Op out of 3 separate conversations - how rude!  She was whispering which is also rude and obviously wanted to leave (body language).\n\nAnd, she saw Op\u2019s formal floor length dress, so that should have been enough of a clue.\n\nOp - in the future make sure to only bring people who are comfortable holding their own.", "Yes. I told her most of the party was going to be 60-70+ year olds, the very wealthy/traditional types and they have a very different idea of opera appropriate than her or I do.", "Everybody judges you all the time. I work for the NHS and it\u2019s written into our contracts that we mustn\u2019t bring our employer or the profession into disrepute. This is not a difficult standard for OP\u2019s friend to grasp. It\u2019s inappropriate to \u201clet your hair down\u201d at an event that is effectively black tie, and you are (still) representing your employer.", "Honestly? I hate admitting this but I just don\u2019t have the strongest spine. I knew when I invited her, she originally had plans for Saturday and she got so excited and cleared her day for it\u2026 I just felt like I couldn\u2019t. I probably should have, in hindsight and I know I need to work on it but I have a really hard time saying no.\n\nEditing to add that I do feel like I was very clear on what the party attendees would be like.", ">Did you not already know your friend enough to know that this kind of event was not something that she would enjoy?\n\nShe\u2019s a former theater kid who loves all kinds of live performances; when I originally invited her, she seemed to feel like 90 minutes of my boring stuff was worth free, prime seat tickets. \n\nI didn\u2019t expect her to love the party portion but I thought she thought it was a fair trade off and be able to get through it.", "nyeh, I feel like the friend is old enough to take responsibility for this.  \n\n\nIt feels like those stories where someone goes on a hike and doesn't wear the right shoes despite being told what was involved", "A good friend would also put up with 40 minutes of networking for a good friend and would aim not to embarrass them at work.", "The seeing OP\u2019s formal length dress is the big thing for me. I feel like if you\u2019re the plus one for an event, you should be matching the formality level as the one bringing you along. Especially if your an outsider, you don\u2019t want to be standing out because of the clothes you wear.\n\nIf anything, Sara should have been coordinating with OP before even leaving her home to make sure her outfit would be appropriate", "hmmmm im gonna go with a very light ESH. Your friend was pretty dense and should have known better/gotten the message, but if you knew that despite it not being a work event it would impact your work/your boss you probably should have just opted to go alone/sell the ticket to avoid any awkward interactions.\n\nMixing friends w/ work can get very messy very quickly if your friends arent used to your work environment\n\nEdit: yikes the downvotes, just to be clear I still think the friend is the bigger AH, but I personally would've just not invited my friend if knew the event wasn't their vibe", "I\u2019m actually going with NTA. I\u2019ve accompanied friends in different professional industries to various formal events and basic common sense says to take their lead and not do anything that may reflect poorly on them even if it\u2019s not strictly a \u201cwork\u201d event. If the friend was feeling uncomfortable because of her insistence on wearing the dress, the correct thing for her to do would\u2019ve been to quietly depart without making a fuss. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable to expect another adult to dress appropriately for the setting, especially if they had fair warning. \n\nI will say, however, that I think OP was a little too nice. I would\u2019ve straight up told the friend that her outfit was unacceptable for the evening and, unfortunately, I wouldn\u2019t be able to bring her along if she didn\u2019t change. The ball still would\u2019ve been in the friend\u2019s court on whether or not to go but being direct is often the best way to prevent situations like this from even occurring.", "I disagree, it sounds like OP gave Sara all the information she needed to make an informed decision about the event, including telling her the dress might be an issue. Sara\u2019s an adult who is presumably capable of understanding that her options are \u201cgo to this event that\u2019s outside her comfort zone and act polite and nice anyway\u201d or \u201copt out and let OP take someone else\u201d. A friend who opts for the 3rd \u201cgo anyway and sulk the whole time\u201d option is being childish and rude. OP is def NTA", "NTA. You warned her re: outfit in advance and she knew this was a work-related event so she should have expected that her comfort would not be your #1 priority. \n\nHonestly what is the deal with all of these \u201cfriends\u201d of AITA writers who tell their friends they are the AH? It is one thing if you are a part of the conflict but when it is someone else who has heard about it and offers such a dumba** opinion I just can\u2019t believe it.", "NTA.\n\nHowever, you should have told her when you extended the invitation what she should wear, not as you were getting dressed.", "NTA you we\u2019re clear since the beginning but, none of you thought about just putting the more traditional dress in a bag, you put it in your car and if anything happens well she can change? Don\u2019t mean to sound mean or anything, I\u2019m just curious lol.", "Let the friend know you do care about her comfort and that you did express your concerns. You even offered her a dress, but Sara made the decision it to change, even though she saw you were wearing a more formal event. You did care, but she ultimately made the decision. When you were ultimately proven correct, it was unfair of her to ask you to jeopardize the relationships you were making at a work adjacent event", "You warned her, it's her own moronic fault, dump her as a friend and go no contact permanently, sheesh \ud83d\ude44", "ESH \n\nThis could have been avoided by insisting her to match your formality or her skipping the party and just attending the opera.

Should've said sit this one out. At the very least have some empathy jfc. \"OH woah is me I have to deal with my friends emotions\". It sounds like it was a shitty time for her regardless. Sounds like anyone who can't get along with \"traditional\" art creeps would have a shite time", "Did you tell her what to wear beforehand or just think it but not actually tell her that her wardrobe choice was inappropriate?", "NTA.

If she's painfully shy, I guess both of you probably should've known better than to have her come along? That's more on her I guess, going to a work event as a plus one often sucks. But do you really think people would've magically talked to her more if she was wearing a different outfit? Maybe so but that strikes me as crazy.

OP had that opportunity and took it. \n\nTo say OP was some degree of AH for not making an executive decision of disinviting her friend after seeing her choice in attire the day of, is a very strong stance that IMO is overly severe. Her friend is presumably a capable adult and she had many options to choose from to handle the situation, up to and including politely excusing herself from the event some time after she arrived and saw the situation she was in (and explicitly warned about/given solutions to mitigate). Life lesson: when in doubt, dress in a similar formality as the primary invitee.\n\n(NTA)", "But it sounds like it could have been fine if Sara wasn't so timid.

Dress slacks, long sleeve button shirt, black or brown shoes.  Business attire would have probably been okay.  Generally speaking short dresses are not worn.

Most of them are just happy you're there. A few examples: the Met in New York says it can be \"a great excuse to dress up,\" the Royal Opera House in London \"only ask that you are fully clothed and that your feet are covered,\" and Sydney Opera House says it can get cold. All three say to dress casually and comfortably. Vienna State Opera recommends formal attire for operas, but don't require it. Going to the opera is a lot more chill these days.", "Sara didn't even need to go home though, OP told her there was a bar nearby that she could go hang out at for an hour.", "I get what you mean, I wasn\u2019t sure how to best describe the type of clothing that could be appropriate and of course shows and movies always show formal attire. Conservative clothing is definitely a good way to describe it, or at least a conservative hem length maybe if a dress is involved. Thank you for responding and clarifying as someone who has actually been to the opera. I\u2019m guessing it can also depend on plenty of social/socioeconomic factors as well when it comes to how people dress. Regardless of any random factors, a dress that\u2019s considered club wear wouldn\u2019t be something people would consider appropriate in my mind, but it\u2019s just an opinion of course.

When I see people enter or leave the the private reception areas it's always black tie for men and formal dress for women.\n\n I usually wear a tea length semi formal black dress or a three piece silk skirt evening suit. My husband wears a nice suit. I've seen opera lovers wearing brown shoes with black dress pants and old tweed blazers, they're wearing what they have and it's all good. As you said, conservative it the way to go and it's fine. \n\nOPs friend most likely wanted the floor to open up and swallow her. I've only seen someone dress that way once and she was clearly a mid level call girl, the high rent ones know how to dress properly. She was getting the side eye and eye rolls for the the brief moment I saw her. The dirty old man she was with was thrilled. \n\nThe friend may have been getting the side eye or snickers from the other guests and wanted to leave due to sheer embarrassment. She should have gone into the lobby or the women's lounge and waited for OP. She clearly doesn't know how to behave in these situations, whispering and pulling OP away is rude to every other guest as well as OP. She was the plus one and she knew this was important to her friend. She had been told she was dressed inappropriately for the venue and was given the opportunity to change her dress. \n\nOP is NTA, her friend is TA.

I\u2019m not defending Sara, but I think that her view of what the evening was (going to the world-class opera together again, just with free tix this time & maybe free drinks at a pre-show event) meant that she felt OP chose stuffy older folks over her.

I feel like the *be fabulous* part of the venue's dress code leaned more towards couture fashion and less towards the dance floor. \n\nAlthough, I am curious if there is opera-themed EDM now. That would be a show.", "I feel like Sara having no idea about the dress code is less and less of an excuse nowadays. As OP lives in a place with a world famous opera, I feel safe in assuming it's a large to reasonably-sized city.

When you invite someone with you to a scene that you may know they\u2019re explicitly not well-versed in/have no acquaintances there, it\u2019s expected (never required) your priority is to keep them included until they\u2019re comfortable. \n\nSara was dumb for not realizing (or caring) it was an important networking event for OP and then throwing a pity party for herself on the ride home. That\u2019s childish and incredibly telling on her as a future +1 to certain events. OP likely shouldn\u2019t invite her again until they have a good talk about it (where OP is not at all required to apologize) Yes, but then I wonder if OP ever explicitly told her it was networking event and not a social one.

When I was in my 20s I worked as an assistant to an older relative and when she was invited to a \"power brunch\" one weekend at a very classy spot in town and I got to tag along, I was ecstatic...this was a place where high-powered business people and the occasional celeb gathered and I couldn't wait to see and be seen. Showed up to her house in a little blue patterned number and when she tried to offer me a dark colored pants outfit, I turned up my nose and said I was comfortable the way I was. \n\nShe didn't argue or push but I will NEVER EVER forget how, within ten minutes of our arrival, I wanted the floor to open up and swallow me whole. Thank goodness I had the sense to do what OP's friend should have done...made an excuse and ducked out to the bar/lounge area for the duration so as not to badly reflect on the person who brought me.

Maybe I'd have fun mingling but if not my friend and I can always just hang out and be mirthful about how stuffy and pretencious everyone is. I would assume that I had someone to hang out with and talk to, someone to catch eyes with, someone to help extricate me from boring conversations or whatever.\n\nThere's a BIG difference between having a friend date and being a third wheel as your friend networks. It's like the difference between going to an event with someone and going solo and happening to know someone else there. But worse because on top of essentially being alone at this event, my dress, behaviour, etc will all reflect on my friend and potentially impact her business relationships. That alone is anxiety provoking and would make me very self conscious.\n\nBecause like I don't care about any of these random rich old people in the room. I don't care what they think of me. I don't have relationships with them or want any. I'm not in community with them. I'm probably never gonna see them again in my life. But if it's gonna potentially impact my friends career, ok, now I care because I care about my friend.\n\nPersonally I wouldn't at all be self conscious dressing like that and going to that event with a friend. I would be self conscious and anxious going as a networking date. More so honestly than if I went alone.\n\nAnd I would handle this especially badly if I didn't know this was essentially a work event until I got there. Because then you're watching your friend suddenly morph from my being your friend who doesn't like these kinds of people to networking with them and playing their game.

I think I'd have been bored by all the stuffy, fake people but I would have found somewhere to sit and scroll through my phone or probably napped.

You didn\u2019t  force her to change because Sara is presumably a grown ass adult who can take responsibility for her own clothing choices once she\u2019s been properly informed of the standard attire. \n\nSecondly, Sara sucks to begin with. I\u2019ve been invited to friends\u2019 work or work-adjacent events. There is no way in hell I would ever show up in something bright pink or short, and Sara shouldn\u2019t have dressed like that to begin with IMO. She\u2019s your guest and her appearance to some extent reflects upon you, and the moment you told her it was work-adjacent she should\u2019ve been dressing appropriately or checking in with you about attire.\n\nThirdly, if she is not having a good time, I am once again going to assume she\u2019s a capable adult who can say something like \u201chey, I\u2019m a feeling little anxious or uncomfortable so would you mind if I sat and waited for you inside?\u201d If it were purely a personal social event that\u2019s one thing, or if for some reason she needed to actually leave the entire place that could be different, but I don\u2019t see any reason she should\u2019ve been pressuring you to leave with her.

He does care about his friend, he also acknowledges that his friend should have better understood his circumstances in this party which is a fair point to make.  \n\n\nThe reason I talk more about OP is because we can only know OP's side of things - of course OP sees the truth in what people are like at the party, OP knows about how they are and knew that their friend's choice of clothing wouldn't go well. OP has experience with these people and made quite a few things clear to his friend about it being an older crowd with seemingly more modest tastes to whatever this dress was.  \n\n\nThe 'Tagalong' friend you refer to as a bad friend, I disagree that is the case just as much as OP is a bad friend. I see this as a moment of their friend didn't understand that this wasn't a party like what you go to in highschool or college - its not a show up for 5 minutes and dip, its socialites and its a large part of their lives: Reputation and Image.  \n\n\nI think the friend may have been a nuisance, it was told clearly (by what OP says) and up-front the crowd this would be. But the key thing I say about OP being a bit of an arse, but not an arsehole, is because he says outright that \"its too damn bad that she was uncomfortable\". He got irritated after being told 3 times that they should leave, completely understand why OP said it. But just because you understand why someone said it doesn't mean there isn't better ways.  \n\n\nI appreciate the reaction of it being a bad take, in the end we all see things based on our experiences. I've been a friend like this, popped my lid off on others despite fair warnings and telling people better which has left a bit of a hole in my heart over the years. I never said that OP is a bad friend, I feel there is no asshole in this situation.  \nBut I'd rather make my point more to OP that him being guilted by the mutal friend is bad (but like OP to us, mutual friend only knows the friend's point of view) and that in a reflective manner, feeling bad can be good - as long as OP is both trying to understand both his and his friend's perspective.  \n\n\nI can only speak about OP because the only true reliable narrative OP can have is about himself. (I don't think OP is lying, I still see it as OP is only half of the story in this issue).", "Wow. So you think adults don\u2019t need reassurance now and then?

It looks like all of the pervs/not understanding of anxiety people are out tonight.", "Then what do you expect? A PowerPoint presentation?", "Here is the OP answer (check in her coments)\n\n\n>Did you prep her prior to the event about dress code, professional expectations, etc?  Once she's at your house with the one dress, it's a little bit late for her to realistically do a wardrobe change, unless you guys are exactly the same size and have shared clothes before.  \n\nWhen I invited her, I told her we would have to attend a cocktail party by my host (she knew this was a friend of my boss and the type of people he associates with) and that I would need to be talking to various guests. I didn\u2019t tell her exactly what to wear but I did make it known that it was going to be treated like a professional event for me for part of the evening. I can see that it was my bad for not spelling out what that meant but I haven\u2019t had to explain that to anyone else before."]}
