This was not a work event for me but still a networking opportunity and a gift from my boss\u2019s personal friend.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 was visiting family so I invited my friend Sara to join me. She arrived at my house Saturday afternoon to get ready with me. She had brought a dress to wear that I didn\u2019t think she should. It was very pretty but more like a club dress than an event dress, bright pink and very short. And our opera is known for a \u201cno dress code, just be fabulous\u201d approach so it was fine for the venue itself but I knew the pre party was going to be an older, more \u201ctraditional opera dress\u201d crowd (I wore a deep green floor length dress, for reference). I offered her the option of choosing something out of my closet and told her that I thought she might be uncomfortable at the party because of the type of group they were but she wanted to wear that dress so I didn\u2019t push it.\n\nAt the party, most of the attendees didn\u2019t seem interested in engaging with her and while outwardly polite, it did feel like they were equally uncomfortable with her presence as she was being there. She stayed next to me the whole time which was fine but she was sullen and kept grabbing my arm to whisper in my ear that we should leave. \n\nAfter the 3rd time Sara pulled me out of a conversation and told me she wanted us to leave the party, I got irritated and told her it was too damn bad that she was uncomfortable, I warned her. There\u2019s two bars out in the public area, she could go hang out there and I\u2019d join her in an hour for the show but I couldn\u2019t leave yet without looking bad. I might not have been \u201cworking\u201d but I accepted the invitation and now my behavior here reflects on my boss and that ultimately affects my job regardless of it not being officially work.\n\nSara stayed at the party instead and eventually it was over and we attended the show. She didn\u2019t speak to me at all on the drive home and texted me after I dropped her off that she was upset by the way I had treated her and that I should have left when she wanted. I think that\u2019s unfair, I talk about my job all the time and she knows very well what expectations are placed on me at these events and how I am expected to act. I tried to tell her but obviously I wasn\u2019t going to force her to change?

I occasionally go to events that are easy for men, it's black tie. But what is the dress code for women? As you have deduced,  it depends on formality of the event and audience. I usually call and ask, is it long dress, cocktail length dress or posh trousers and smart jacket? We work it out beforehand.  It's embarrassing to be dressed differently  and that's without the faux pas of wearing a clubbing dress. \n\nI'm not surprised Sara felt uncomfortable but she didn't listen  and misjudged her attire. The immediate compromise would have been for her to go to the other bar and leave you to your networking. Sulking and trying to ruin your event was silly.", "The fact you\u2019re even asking this question shows you\u2019re a kind, empathetic person. Sara did a dumb thing that she was warned against.

Than this is on her. Learning the appropriate outfits for different social settings is part of  becoming an adult.

Especially because she could have gone to the open bars and like many people, waited for the opera to start and had a seat and a drink and looked at her phone. She didn't need you to leave with her in order to get somewhere safe, or for a ride, etc, so she had full autonomy to step out of the party and still be in a safe environment. \n\nIt doesn't really matter that you told her she wasn't dressed exactly right, she wasn't wearing sweats or anything like that, and she is also an adult who should understand this was a work function for you and she needed to make it work or sit and wait for you.", "NTA, it's the opera and a work event. She should have dressed appropriately and known that you had professional mingling to do.", "NTA, some people don't have any sense of propriety. Frankly seeing her at your house would have been enough for me to cancel her ticket and tell her to head home or to a bar where it might be appropriate. \n\nThe onus is on the guest of an event to conform to the rules, not on the event to make exceptions.", "It could also be that your boss gifted you these tickets to, I don\u2019t know, enjoy and let your hair down. Not everything is about work and those people at the party didn\u2019t know who got you the tickets. So it didn\u2019t reflect on your job or your boss in any way. That you chose to network is fine, and as long as Sara knew that, you did nothing wrong. But maybe you could have made some time, just you and her, to have a little fun and crack some jokes. NAH", "NTA. F*ck around and find out. Wear an inappropriate dress and be uncomfortable. You\u2019re not her babysitter and this was through a work connection.", "INFO: why didn\u2019t you cancel her invitation when she was clearly not willing to dress appropriately for your work event?\n\nIt will have reflected badly that the two of you were there together, and that she was sulking and being rude the whole time. \n\nIt sounds like you weren\u2019t clear enough that her decisions & behaviour weren\u2019t acceptable for the event, and would result in her losing her invitation. \n\nDo you think you were sufficiently clear?", "ESH. im sorry, maybe im just crazy, but why would you invite your friend to a networking event if you were just going to ignore them the whole time?  why wouldnt you tell her that her outfit was inappropriate for the event and tell her that if she can't dress appropriately, her invitation would be revoked? Did you not already know your friend enough to know that this kind of event was not something that she would enjoy? it sounds like she's not the kind of person who would mesh well with that kind of event in the first place, so inviting her to begin with was a mistake. \n\nLike no, you shouldnt have left when she wanted, but at the same time, why would you put either one of you in this position in the first place?", "NAH.\n\nYou warn her about the dress, you told her that it was important for you to stay here and she's an adult. She wasn't in danger or having a mental episode, she's a big girl that can leave the party and find a way to occupy herself for what I would expect is 1 hour-30min? \n\nAt the same time, it wasn't a work event, you invited her as your friend and you kind of just brushed her off. Maybe I'm wrong, but I don't think your friend is used to this type of event and she just didn't know what your warning was implying. You can't really blame her really thrust you anymore, especially in situation she isn't used to be in.\n\nAt the end of the day, you were definitively not caring about her comfort. You told her straight up, it's too bad you are uncomfortable, I'm staying at the event. I'm not saying you should leave the event right away when she told you, but you could have discussed with her a compromise. Maybe no good comprise could be found, but you didn't seem to have even tried.", "YTA - You are making an awful lot about the dress she wore but from what you say, it looks a lot more like she was uncomfortable because nobody was engaging with her at all. As you were off networking with people you were probably also ignoring her. It\u2019s not any fun being at a party where nobody speaks to you. \n\nI am not saying you ought to have left when she wanted but I think you didn\u2019t have to be networking the entire time and spent some time on your own with your friend. You weren\u2019t on the clock after all and could have balanced things better.", "YTA  - you were rude to your friend and guest. A good friendship trumps 40 minutes of networking.", "Did you explain to her what the party would be like when you initially invited her? Is she an extrovert normally?", "NTA. While it may not have been a work event you were still technically working, jobs like these aren\u2019t 9-5, networking is extremely important in these sectors, you need to build and maintain relationships and reputations too. \n\nYou also warned her beforehand of what she was getting into and gave her the option to change which she chose not to heed. \n\nHonestly I think she\u2019s a major asshole for potentially jeopardising your work reputation, she\u2019s your friend and it was one night, she should of just dealt with it instead of acting like a child.", "NTA - you warned her and she ignored it.", "Nta she\u2019s an adult, you are not her parent.

I would flip it on her and tell her how embarrassing and childlike she\u2019s acting and for the foreseeable future she will no longer be attending these events with you.", "NTA! a: You warned her. b: You really were kinda working. c: Leaving. the party would have been a bit of a snub to the person who had given you the tickets. Sara needs to get over herself.", "NTA. It\u2019s like when people show up in sandals for a hike and you have to remind them this isn\u2019t a regular walk on paved trails of a city park but a trek in the woods with mud, rocks and streams to cross. \u201cOh I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d And five minurptes later they are wining about stones in their sandals and uneven ground. \n\nAlways listen to the people with the experience.", "NTA.\n\n>she was upset by the way I had treated her and that I should have left when she wanted.\n\nI'm sorry... why? If she is that uncomfortable, then the option of her leaving by herself exists. Pretty selfish of her to think that you should have left what was an important work-adjacent event for her.\n\nShe was uncomfortable because she was out of her element and her dress made her stick out like a sore thumb. But the former was something she should have been aware of given the nature of the events, and the latter was a result of her own choice.", "NTA \n\nIt is obvious she is not accustomed to these events. Not being accustomed, she would have been wise taking your advice. Instead she chose to double down and got the treatment you predicted. She then triple downed and demanded you accommodate her because she was foolish enough to not listen. \n\nShe is the AH. She was given chances, chose to ignore experienced advice, and suffered for it. Next time, IF there is a next time, maybe she will listen.", "You cared enough about her to A - invite her, B - explain the expectations for the pre-party and C - offer her choice of any of the more pre-party appropriate dresses from your wardrobe.  \n\nSara did not care for you enough to take your guidance to heart and, despite how it would make you look,wanted you to leave when she predictably felt uncomfortably out of place.\n\nNTA", "I just want to add though - while I\u2019m sure there was judgment, Sara\u2019s behavior probably made it worse than just wearing an inappropriate outfit.\n\nWhen you\u2019re uncomfortable you can appear standoffish. Additionally, it sounds like Sara was standing next to Op the entire time while also choosing not to engage with others. She pulled Op out of 3 separate conversations - how rude!  She was whispering which is also rude and obviously wanted to leave (body language).\n\nAnd, she saw Op\u2019s formal floor length dress, so that should have been enough of a clue.\n\nOp - in the future make sure to only bring people who are comfortable holding their own.", "Yes. I told her most of the party was going to be 60-70+ year olds, the very wealthy/traditional types and they have a very different idea of opera appropriate than her or I do.", "Everybody judges you all the time. I work for the NHS and it\u2019s written into our contracts that we mustn\u2019t bring our employer or the profession into disrepute. This is not a difficult standard for OP\u2019s friend to grasp. It\u2019s inappropriate to \u201clet your hair down\u201d at an event that is effectively black tie, and you are (still) representing your employer.", "Honestly? I hate admitting this but I just don\u2019t have the strongest spine. I knew when I invited her, she originally had plans for Saturday and she got so excited and cleared her day for it\u2026 I just felt like I couldn\u2019t. I probably should have, in hindsight and I know I need to work on it but I have a really hard time saying no.\n\nEditing to add that I do feel like I was very clear on what the party attendees would be like.", ">Did you not already know your friend enough to know that this kind of event was not something that she would enjoy?\n\nShe\u2019s a former theater kid who loves all kinds of live performances; when I originally invited her, she seemed to feel like 90 minutes of my boring stuff was worth free, prime seat tickets. \n\nI didn\u2019t expect her to love the party portion but I thought she thought it was a fair trade off and be able to get through it.", "nyeh, I feel like the friend is old enough to take responsibility for this.  \n\n\nIt feels like those stories where someone goes on a hike and doesn't wear the right shoes despite being told what was involved", "A good friend would also put up with 40 minutes of networking for a good friend and would aim not to embarrass them at work.", "The seeing OP\u2019s formal length dress is the big thing for me. I feel like if you\u2019re the plus one for an event, you should be matching the formality level as the one bringing you along. Especially if your an outsider, you don\u2019t want to be standing out because of the clothes you wear.\n\nIf anything, Sara should have been coordinating with OP before even leaving her home to make sure her outfit would be appropriate", "hmmmm im gonna go with a very light ESH. Your friend was pretty dense and should have known better/gotten the message, but if you knew that despite it not being a work event it would impact your work/your boss you probably should have just opted to go alone/sell the ticket to avoid any awkward interactions.\n\nMixing friends w/ work can get very messy very quickly if your friends arent used to your work environment\n\nEdit: yikes the downvotes, just to be clear I still think the friend is the bigger AH, but I personally would've just not invited my friend if knew the event wasn't their vibe", "I\u2019m actually going with NTA. I\u2019ve accompanied friends in different professional industries to various formal events and basic common sense says to take their lead and not do anything that may reflect poorly on them even if it\u2019s not strictly a \u201cwork\u201d event. If the friend was feeling uncomfortable because of her insistence on wearing the dress, the correct thing for her to do would\u2019ve been to quietly depart without making a fuss. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable to expect another adult to dress appropriately for the setting, especially if they had fair warning. \n\nI will say, however, that I think OP was a little too nice. I would\u2019ve straight up told the friend that her outfit was unacceptable for the evening and, unfortunately, I wouldn\u2019t be able to bring her along if she didn\u2019t change. The ball still would\u2019ve been in the friend\u2019s court on whether or not to go but being direct is often the best way to prevent situations like this from even occurring.", "I disagree, it sounds like OP gave Sara all the information she needed to make an informed decision about the event, including telling her the dress might be an issue. Sara\u2019s an adult who is presumably capable of understanding that her options are \u201cgo to this event that\u2019s outside her comfort zone and act polite and nice anyway\u201d or \u201copt out and let OP take someone else\u201d. A friend who opts for the 3rd \u201cgo anyway and sulk the whole time\u201d option is being childish and rude. OP is def NTA", "NTA. You warned her re: outfit in advance and she knew this was a work-related event so she should have expected that her comfort would not be your #1 priority. \n\nHonestly what is the deal with all of these \u201cfriends\u201d of AITA writers who tell their friends they are the AH? It is one thing if you are a part of the conflict but when it is someone else who has heard about it and offers such a dumba** opinion I just can\u2019t believe it.", "NTA.\n\nHowever, you should have told her when you extended the invitation what she should wear, not as you were getting dressed.", "NTA you we\u2019re clear since the beginning but, none of you thought about just putting the more traditional dress in a bag, you put it in your car and if anything happens well she can change? Don\u2019t mean to sound mean or anything, I\u2019m just curious lol.", "Let the friend know you do care about her comfort and that you did express your concerns. You even offered her a dress, but Sara made the decision it to change, even though she saw you were wearing a more formal event. You did care, but she ultimately made the decision. When you were ultimately proven correct, it was unfair of her to ask you to jeopardize the relationships you were making at a work adjacent event", "You warned her, it's her own moronic fault, dump her as a friend and go no contact permanently, sheesh \ud83d\ude44", "ESH \n\nThis could have been avoided by insisting her to match your formality or her skipping the party and just attending the opera. You left her off the hook and it came back to bite you both.\n\nShe didn't understand prior to the event what it was about, and so it was your job as a host to make her understand and care for her wellbeing. \n\nShe should have understood that this is a networking event and not something you buy your tickets and greet a couple of people you happen to meet there by chance. She should have taken your hint of the dress, she should have left you to network in peace with a smile on her face, and she should have taken the L and went to wait you in the bar.", "awww I thought she was your fiance. i was like, yessssss a story about 2 beautiful femmes, one is classy and the other sassy.", "YTA why do you hang out with freaks who other people because they wear something appropriate and cute?

Maybe be a good friend and don't even bring them to some weirdo event like that.\n\nEspecially since it's a work event why would you even put your friends in a situation they can't leave with a bunch of weirdos. Should've said sit this one out. At the very least have some empathy jfc. \"OH woah is me I have to deal with my friends emotions\". It sounds like it was a shitty time for her regardless. Sounds like anyone who can't get along with \"traditional\" art creeps would have a shite time", "Did you tell her what to wear beforehand or just think it but not actually tell her that her wardrobe choice was inappropriate?", "NTA.

She should at least be taking responsibility, apologising and trying to find solutions *with* you rather than asking you to drop everything for her.\n\nYou also pre-warned her so she didn't have any excuse. And now she is moping rather than accepting that she is responsible for the massive social faux pas that she committed.\n\nYes if you don't care at all that's a little cold. But she is acting like a spoilt child.", "NTA, and she could have taken an Uber or public transit if she was uncomfortable with what she chose to wear.", "I agree, and I actually think that the warning should have been given *before* Sara got to OP's house.  Ideally, OP should have told her about the dress code when she invited her.  She could have even sent her a pic of what she was earing to give Sara ideas. \n\nRegardless, OP is NTA.", "Kinda the the A.  You could have compromised a bit for your friend.", "NTA, and she could have taken an Uber or public transit if she was uncomfortable with what she chose to wear.", "The Devil Wears Prada part is gold!", "I agree a million times. People too often really are completely unwilling to live by any rules but their own. It's happening in jobs, while dining out, even at weddings and funerals. People need to grow up and recognize that people around them also have feelings and preferences, and that demanding that you dress or act exactly how you please can be incredibly disrespectful to them, depending on the circumstances.", "Likely because she still wanted to go to the opera.", "Maybe they would treat her better, if there was any effort from her side to make a nice impression and have a small talk with different people. She, clinging to OP's arm and whispering constantly to their ear couldn't make good impression. I'm sure the other guests cold turn a blind eye on inappropriate dress, if Sara was nice, intellligent, funny and was wearing her \"clubbing dress\" with nonchalance and courage. She could be seemed a bit eccentric or funny, but - who cares, it was just one evening anyway. She acted weird, unsecure and sulking all the time - no wonder she was like a sore thumb between all these people, and not only because of the short pink dress.", "This was a work-related event where a client had invited OP. Besides, Sara's own dress choice made her feel out of place and she was clinging to OP preventing her from networking. \n\nOP is not TA however you look at it.", "As far as I can see in this case, this was the young Sarah's problem. She was feeling uncomfortable in her dress and could't deal with it.   \nIf she was feeling good and safe in the dress, she wouldn't give a damn about what other people are thinking about her.   \nI remember, when I was younger, I was wearing quite flamboyant and very unconventional clothes. Never ever was feeling bad in them, even between old, conservative people. And- surprise, surprise - when they could see, that I can also talk with them about something and listen to them, nobody was thinking about my clothes.", "OP literally warned her friend before she went, told the type of people and told where they were going and the friend refused to listen. OP shouldn't have to trash an opportunity because their friend thought all was chill with a club dress", "I'm sure these \"stupid conservative people\" would enjoy small talk and some jokes with a glass of wine with her, if she wouldn't be so visibly \"out of place\" - not by her dress, but by her behaviour. If she could play it with nonchalance and courage, she could have some fun there. As she acted clingy, unsecure and childlish, nobody really wanted to talk to her, because she wasn't looking as interesting person to them. The dress, I'm sure, was more her problem then theirs.", "OP said in another comment that she told Sara exactly what kind of party was going on and what audience was in the room", "OP said in another comment that she told Sara exactly what kind of party was going on and what audience was in the room", "Guys, I found the neckbeard!", "Yes, I have experienced this. My roommate in college and I have a lot of fun when we are doing something together, so I asked her to come to reunion. I wanted to socialize with people but she was really shy and followed me around when she was in the same class as I was. Sometimes people are awkward in large gatherings and that might have also been at play here.\n\nOp is NTA and the dress was certainly not her fault. Also, know that Sara is not good in large groups.", ">Op - in the future make sure to only bring people who are comfortable holding their own.\n\nLast time I did that, they kicked me out of the theater.", "Shit dude, I ask interviewers what the appropriate attire for the interview will be when we schedule it. Every one of them has seemed to appreciate it. Granted, my experience is limited because I haven't ever taken long to get the job at the place I want to work most, or ive been directly recruited.. So, 2 or 3 interviews twice in my life.", "God, I spent twelve hours and thought I was in hell. You must really be evil to get a day and a half.", "The compromise was that the friend could've gone to a nearby bar outside the event and OP would join when appropriate?", "Exactly.\n\nI work in government as a technician, water treatment specifically.\n\nWe have an annual conference which has guest speakers including high ranking government officials.  It's a 3 day event and on the final night of the event, there is always an open bar for everyone to network, see what's new in the industry, etc.\n\nMy GF attended with me a few times, it's held in a different city and we were staying in the hotel it was taking place in.  During the daytime events, she would walk the city, or swim in the hotel pool.  And at the party at the end, she comes to say hello to friends of mine in the industry, have a few drinks and finger foods.  Once she'd had enough, what does she do? Not drag me away from conversations to force me to leave, she will excuse herself back to the hotel room, and may or may not be still awake when I finally leave.  \n\nIf OPs friend was that uncomfortable she could of excused herself completely and got a taxi/Uber.  If I was OP I may have even paid for the friends Uber just to get back to what I came for without interruption.", "INFO: was there anything else making her uncomfortable, or was it just the dress?", "It's not your job to babysit an adult who was warned what the crowd would be. Now you know not to include her in large, work related gatherings.", "Well you are pretty damn sure for a person who wasn't there and is not in the heads of the other attendants. But hey, glad to have met someone with those types of psychic abilities. \nI find conservative people stupid, you don't have to share that opinion. Goodbye.", "I voted like I did because it was a failure to communicate effectively by OP's part (saying isn't the same as getting the point across), and for Sara for raining on OP's parade.", "NTA. Sarah is an adult and you told her what to expect and that it was a work event. She could have taken an uber back if she felt that uncomfortable.\n\nDon't beat yourself up over someone else's idiocy.", "Especially when she is getting free tickets to the opera and free drinks.", "Do not good sir me at all, stranger. You do not know me and i am not a sir. OP mentions it's an older, more \"traditional\" crowd. I'm aware of the cultural context, hence why I think they are weirdos lol. I know if it was my friends, I would not friviously invite them to an event where the people would make them feel excluded because they're dressed in something cute and appropriate but not within a strict traditionalist culture. At the very least, I'd console that friend even if I warned them because it's still ultimately on the traditionalist types who like to exclude, for being kind of jerks.", "Oh wow it's like you intentionally ignored the rest of my comments and picked something that you'd think was particularly insulting to me to hurt my feelings because id... what console my friend I invited to a work function? Get her a ride or something? Not tell her I don't care and I warned her? According to OP she was being othered because she wore a slightly shorter dress lmao. Caring about my friends emotions even though I'm at a work function makes me a neckbeard I guess", "Yes if I'm the guest I 100% check my outfit with my person to make sure I'll fit in, be comfy and not a hinderance etc it's basic. Sara refused to listen and got what she deserved. She could have made her own way home", "Well, when it is a career-related event as well, people will be more careful whom they invite. This was OP's chance to network as well and having someone tagging along wanting to leave was not ideal.", "Now you are psychic and know for sure, that these people, attending that event, are conservative :). As far we know, it was only your supposition.   \nI find people shooting their own foot stupid, you don't have to share that opinion ;).", "Or maybe her friend could have joined in on conversation or mingled with guests like everyone else. OP is not a baby sitter", "Clearly too young for the opera.", "More like you being incredibly judgmental and downright nasty toward something that's not your cup of tea makes you come off as the basement-dwelling gamer kid who calls every other activity in existence \"fucking lame\" and acts like they're the only person of taste in the whole school. Like seriously, I heard ReddX narrating while reading you talk about how the OP \"said\" that everyone sucked and that it was a \"weirdo event.\" Whatever other comments you've made, it's clear that you have nothing but open and vocal contempt for anyone who isn't exactly like you, and THAT is beardy behavior.", "No more free opera tickets for Sourpuss Sarah.", "Then the earlier event should have been eclipsed by the enjoyment of the performance! And then she was sulking again... what perseverance.", "Im not 80, so sure lol. I just think this is such a crazy thread. I didn't know knee-length dresses were so controversial truthfully. It all feels so pompous to me. The vibe I'm getting is I'm too POOR for the opera.", "We're talking about an opera, OP made it clear it's a traditional culture which has obvious connotations. OP distinctified that she was treated this way because of what she was wearing and that she literally knew it could happen. I dont fw this kind of judgement and I dont fw OPs snide, pompous \"suck it up buttercup\" attitude. I think the comments are disgusting and judgemental, I think the people OP hangs out with are judgemental and I think OPs giving them a pass so she can network. If you want to network with people you think your friends won't get along with just go alone. \n\nI'm just using the word weirdo anyway and based on her description of her colleagues they sound weird, sorry! They sound like they'd infantalize me for wearing a knee-length skirt! I find that super weird. I don't care if you think I'm being judgemental of people who act like that, I am. I think OP, understanding this, and seeing her friends discomfort, could've not been mean to her friend! She could resolve this now by simply showing some empathy.\n\nEdit: also not write like a whole reddit thread dissing her lol.", ">The vibe I'm getting is I'm too POOR for the opera.\n\nYes.", "yeah, why couldn't she take an uber back home. OP was networking.", "Ew put that bag back on."]}
