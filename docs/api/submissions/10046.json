Is he a caregiver?", "Yes. This can be normal with head trauma. While you can (and should) ask your doctor about this at your followup appointment, this is something that I see fairly frequently with patients who have fainted, hit their head, or both. It is frequently a disorienting experience and if you suffered a concussion or any kind of brain bleed (the ER will have scanned for one during your visit) it isnt uncommon to have memory gaps in the time soon after the injury.

Your body is making sure important stuff is happening like keeping baby and you alive etc. I wouldn't doubt you were low in calcium and other things too. When you aren't getting enough nutrients, your body provides for baby (literally). \n\nI am sure your doctor is all over this, but make sure to follow up with your OB. The ER is mainly there to keep you alive and get you stable, you will most likely need more care. I had to have a feeding tube during mine due to HG (hypermesis gravidarum), and if you continue to not keep anything down, it might be a good option. Ask your doctor. It is uncomfortable and not ideal, but I was much less weak with it and my weightloss stabelized some. Also, take care of your teeth! I know I wasn't thinking much about it at the time, I could barely do anything, but the acid/vomiting/lack of calcium did a number on them. \n\nMany hugs from a far.

Tell your amazing mom your concerns. She will look out for you.", "Just do not let your husband know you are documenting anything. I would leave him , by staying in the house with him after what he did without your consent to him you are in a way agreeing with his despicable behavior .

Step back, I'm gonna kick their asses myself.\"", "I mean this in the nicest possible way - even if none of this had happened and all your husband did was simply not take care of you..... he would be the asshole and I would be suggesting seriously rethinking the relationship   \n\nhow much has he taken care of you as your health has gotten worse? you've lost 40 pounds, been passing out, have basically non existent iron, were just hospitalised for a week   \n\nwhy did he even put you in the position of needing to walk to go get yourself drink? you shouldn't be responsible for your own food and drink right now, you shouldn't be responsible for cleaning up after yourself   \n\nyour health didn't get this bad overnight, this has been going on for awhile. has he been cooking for you or going out to get you foods you think you can tolerate? has he been the one doing the dishes and taking care of the cleaning and other household responsibilities?   \n\nI'm guessing not. I'm guessing that while he behaviour and disrespect seemingly turned overnight when you came home from the hospital and found..... this.... that even before this he wasn't taking care of you\n\nand in this context, taking care of you isn't just a nice and sweet thing to do. it's not doting on your spouse and going above and beyond. it is a simple and very basic responsibility. and failing that responsibility and being neglectful risks serious health consequences for you and the baby   \n\nif that had been the only issue here, everyone would have agreed that he was TA here and would be asking if you had a support system who could pitch it. we would be asking if your mom or family member or friend could come stay with you and take care of you or if there was someone you could go to stay with. and we would be counseling you to seriously we consider the relationship \n\nbut not only was he neglectful in terms of your health and the babies health, he then actively made it harder for you to take care of yourself and added an enormous amount of stress and made it harder for you to sleep and then expected you to do a ridiculous amount of labour caring for several other people   \n\neven when your BIL moves out and even assuming your husband apologises profusely..... is he actually going to take care of you? is he going to put your needs and your health first? is he going to be considerate of your needs? can you trust him to do all the household cleaning and errands for the next several months?? and this is all without adding a baby into the mix and babies require a LOT more care and prioritisation. would you trust him with a baby? to take care of a baby and be responsible for their needs. WITHOUT you there to make sure he does everything properly\n\nhe was wildly abusive to you when you're dangerously ill. he risked the health and well being of both his spouse and his soon to be child. can you trust someone like that with your health and well being in the future? can you trust someone like that with the health and well being of your child?", "Luv, a break won't hurt you but staying there might. \n\nGive yourself a break and go stay with Mum for a while. Doesn't mean your relationship is over, just means you need to be in a comfortable and safe space for your mental and physical health while you and your husband figure out why things went so far off the rails while you were in hospital. \n\nThe chances of you and your husband working it out will be better with a little space for now.", "Yes, your BIL and his family are in a bad situation; it is kind of you to recognize that, and your husband wanting to help them is not the problem. It is how your husband went about it and his complete lack of concern for you. It would be one thing if your BIL had some kind of emergency, needed help, and an emergency place to stay. \n\nBUT instead of your husband asking you, cleaning things up, or even apologizing after the fact and promising to clean. He has put additional burdens on his pregnant wife, who just got out of the hospital, was disrespectful of her and her things, causing her additional stress instead of trying to aid her recovery. He blamed you when house guests that were forced on you tried to interfere with your job, couldn't clean up a mess, and sent his family to harass you. Instead of being concerned about his pregnant wife, he has systematically made your health situation worse, taken away the privacy and safety of your home, interfered in your employment, manipulated you, made sure that you are surrounded by people loyal to him, and had his family guilt and blame you for being upset by his behavior. \n\nThis is a lot of red flags in a short amount of time. If you are going to stay with him, he needs to put in a lot of work to regain your trust. The problem is not your in-laws, it is how your husband is treating you and how he is allowing and enabling his family to treat you. DO NOT let him shift this as he just wanted to help family and about how important family is.

He betrayed you in so many ways. Moving a whole family into your house without your permission while you were hospitalized is a massive betrayal. Leaving the house destroyed is a massive betrayal. Allowing his brother's family to treat you the way they did in your home is a massive betrayal. Speaking the way he did to you was a massive betrayal. But add to it the fact that you are 4 months pregnant with hypernemasis and have a fresh concussion... I don't know what to say other than his callous disregard for your health is not something easy to come back from and the fact that he doesn't understand the gravity of what he did... this is where hopefully counseling will help.", "MIL ended up coming over ready to have words (because BIL lied to MIL about everything), saw the chaos and destruction first hand, and promptly went all Red Foreman on BIL, SIL, and OP's hubs.\n\nMIL is 100% on OP's side now, helping out and giving ppl the boot.", "The updates are awesome.\n\nNow it looks less like OP's husband is an abuser and more like he's a total mornic dipsh\\*t.  And his brother isn't any better.", "I'm Filipina, and it's the same in our culture. I finally had enough and taught myself to say no to faaaaamily.", "Both", "Once the dust settles can you make a proper update post?", "OP mentioned hubby was scrubbing the guest bathroom, which does suggest a larger house (and gives you a sense of how this evening is progressing).", "Your MIL and mom know whats up. Good on them for straightening your husband's foolishness out and turning out the unwanted and rude houseguests. \n\nThink very long and hard about what your husband has done. Clearly his brother and his wife had options, but they didn't want to exercise them because they think beggars can be choosers. Obviously MIL is willing to help them - with certain conditions and expectations - as it should be when your lifestyle is being floated by someone else. Do not allow your BIL or SIL back into your home - ever - that includes holidays.\n\nConsider taking your father up on his offer to pay your husbands portion of the house in case you decide what your husband did was unforgiveable, even if you don't think things will go that direction. Get the conversation started with him so he can prepare in the event you need to do so. \n\nOffer your husband couples counseling virtually, and do not let him back home until he can muster a sincere apology for his lack of forethought about your current condition and inviting too many unwelcome guests into the home during a pivotal time.", "I am so relieved to read this update.\n\nYour mom and MIL (along with your family) came through in a big way today. I\u2019m so glad that you were cared for and treated with the kindness and gentleness that you and baby need right now.\n\nZofran made it possible for me to function while I was pregnant. I\u2019m really hopeful that with meds and the IV your doctor recommended, you\u2019ll start to feel more like yourself. A couple of other anti-nausea food recommendations - lemonade, lavender shortbread (our fancy grocery store has it) and sour candies. I promise, you will not feel this terrible forever!", "I'll do it.", "sending you strength OP \u2763\ufe0f\u2763\ufe0f\u2763\ufe0f\u2763\ufe0f\u2763\ufe0f", "My abuser tried to get me pregnant, and when we found out I was infertile, he left. Gotta be the only time NOT ABLE to get pregnant worked in someone's favor. I didn't even realize how bad it had been until he was gone. \n\nIt sounds like OP has a supportive family, and would be better off without said husband.", "Meh. We have a 3 bed 2 bath house, that has what I think would\u2019ve been a \u201cformal dining room\u201d in the 70s, but is now our animal+workout room lol\n\nIt\u2019s small-medium sized house. \n\nI can easily fit a shit ton of people and kids in here, temporarily.", "Yep", "Lemonade and salt and vinegar chips got me through. I was literally sniffing lemons my entire pregnancy.", "Ginger ale helped me. I basically only drank that for the time my morning sickness was bad. I heard sour candies can't help.", ">But I\u2019m perplexed now as to how hubby thought this was going to go \u2026 his own mom turned on him when she learned the truth!\n\nThat's not how I read it. I think his mother called OP and reamed OP out.", "All this needs to be considered, but not right this second.  I think if the BiL and his family leaves, and her mother stays with them for a while, OP can start feeling better and that\u2019s more important than deciding about the marriage.\n\nIf husband cares about her, he can be taught by his Mom and MiL how to take care of his wife when she is ill.  He should also go to individual therapy to find out why he behaved so badly, what does he really feel about becoming a father, etc.\n\nWhen OP is physically stronger, they will need to go to counseling together and decide if they should stay together."]}
