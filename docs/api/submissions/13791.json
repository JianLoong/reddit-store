She should learn to look after herself.", "NTA, you have many valid reasons for being upfront about this hypothetical future, her holding you to a yes being the main one. She's an adult who needs to manage this potential future on her own, you just know that your entire life will be either verbal and emotional abuse or serving her if she moves in. Next time your aunts tell you you're being mean, tell them they can offer her a room if they're so concerned and the issue would be solved. Additionally, you would be doing her no favors with false hope. Stay strong, my mom's the same way and she's moving in with me when hell freezes over.", "NTA - additionally if she\u2019s incapable of doing most anything, I don\u2019t know if she can be considered a functioning alcoholic.\n\nSo yeah, even agreeing to hypothetically let an alcoholic incapable of caring for herself come to live with you is just not a good idea. You don\u2019t want to let there be any wiggle room. Leave zero ambiguity.\n\nIf your aunts are so concerned about her mental state, *they* can offer for her to live with them.", "NTA you don't need to be a replacement carer if your dad dies before your mum.\n\nIf your aunties continue to give you grief, tell them to volunteer to look after her, better still, next time your mum comes up with her hypothetical, tell her that you're sure that your aunties would love to look after.", "NTA- She\u2019s an adult just like you are. You have the right to say no and you know your own mother so you know you have to stand firm in your decision. I think it\u2019s kind of you to offer to teach her! Plus it will greatly benefit her in the long run to learn how to live on her own! :-)", "NTA, living with an alcoholic would be pure hell. And you are right about the basic skills. It is not your problem to solve. Stay firm.\n\nAnd tell your aunties they can take her in if they think that it is so easy and a duty of a relative.", "NTA. Your aunts can \"hypothetically\" take her in.", "Given what you\u2019ve posted, it sounds like your mother needs to take action for her situation. And you need to protect yourself from what sounds like a situation that would be unhealthy for you. I\u2019ve heard awful stories about parents living with their kids despite having a good relationship before hand. \nNTA good luck and be kind to yourself for knowing what you need. You e offered to help her be self sufficient and I\u2019m guessing would keep an eye on her if your dad passes. That\u2019s totally acceptable in my opinion", "NTA\n\nYour mum needs a reality check. And\n\n>if dad passes before she does, and I\u2019ll teach the basic life skills she needs to look after herself\n\nSorry, but why can't she learn when he is still alive? If she's not willing to do it now there is no way she'll change. First she will be grieving. \n\nAfter that she'll pretend she's trying, but in \"it's soooo hard and makes me unhappy, it's basically an abuse\" way. And then she'll become an old lady, who needs help with everything, because it's child's duty to take care of helpless parent...\n\nAnd one more thing: what would happen if your father's health deteriorates and he needs help, maybe for a long time?", "She sounds horrendous. As much as you love her it is not your responsibility to attend to her if your dad passes away first. She should have been the one teaching you life skills, not the other way around. I imagine if you give in you could end up being her servant for years or even decades. Don't budge", "NTA. she\u2019s an alcoholic and a leech. she could look after herself if she wanted but she\u2019s comfortable in her so called incompetence.", "NTA, very normal response", "NTA - your mum is an adult and agreeing to such a demand could ruin your life by increasing financial demands and stress \u2026.and ruining the peace and quiet of your life! I\u2019d suggest that you get a plan together for when your dad Id no longer around - I don\u2019t mean a plan around you looking after her but a plan where it\u2019s written down all the info your mum will need to support herself \u2026\n\nThe bank details - loans, mortgage, acct details\nThe utilities - acct numbers, average costs, which account paid out of\u2026also where re the meters located and when are readings sent in\nHealth - insurance details, doctor contact info\nThe will - where is it and what does it say.\n\nThese are conversations your dad needs to have with your mum and get it all written down but if he won\u2019t then you ask him and write it down because it will lessen your stress when your father dies. Potentially you could be looking at her living with you for up to 40 years - take every step of action now to minimise her reliance on you and your dad so it\u2019s not so daunting for her to be alone\n\nAlso - tell your aunts that you love how much they care about their sister so why don\u2019t they offer her to move in with them!!", "NTA. Not at all. Your aunts can have her. Don't give in to her at all.\n\n>However I know mum will hold me to it if I say yes\n\nYou've said no plenty of times.
