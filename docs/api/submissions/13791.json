She's an adult who needs to manage this potential future on her own, you just know that your entire life will be either verbal and emotional abuse or serving her if she moves in. Next time your aunts tell you you're being mean, tell them they can offer her a room if they're so concerned and the issue would be solved.

I\u2019d suggest that you get a plan together for when your dad Id no longer around - I don\u2019t mean a plan around you looking after her but a plan where it\u2019s written down all the info your mum will need to support herself \u2026\n\nThe bank details - loans, mortgage, acct details\nThe utilities - acct numbers, average costs, which account paid out of\u2026also where re the meters located and when are readings sent in\nHealth - insurance details, doctor contact info\nThe will - where is it and what does it say.\n\nThese are conversations your dad needs to have with your mum and get it all written down but if he won\u2019t then you ask him and write it down because it will lessen your stress when your father dies. Potentially you could be looking at her living with you for up to 40 years - take every step of action now to minimise her reliance on you and your dad so it\u2019s not so daunting for her to be alone\n\nAlso - tell your aunts that you love how much they care about their sister so why don\u2019t they offer her to move in with them!!", "NTA.
