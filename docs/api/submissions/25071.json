They were originally supposed to pick up the baby at 10pm but we decided that I would drop the baby off in the morning because they stayed out later than expected and the baby was sleeping by the time they were done. I babysat on Saturday night and had work on Sunday afternoon.\n\n  \nI dropped the baby off at 9am and went to work at noon, at 2pm I noticed I had a few missed calls from Ashley. I figured that i forgot to give something of the baby's at my house but didn't see it as a emergency so i decided it could wait until I was on lunch break at 4:30pm. \n\n  \nWhen I called Ashley back, she immediately started screaming at me and my heart dropped. She immediately accused me of hurting her child as she noticed a dark grapefruit sized mark on her upper back. I denied harming the baby and told her I didn't notice the mark and told her if the mark was there before the baby was off dropped to me then I didn't see it. I didn't give the baby a bath and just gave her a bottle and maybe changed 2 diapers before she was out cold. In the morning I had changed her diaper again before giving her back to her parents and didn't see anything weird.\n\n  \nAshley hung up on me and said she would be calling the police. I started freaking out and started having a panic attack at work, after about 30 minutes of not being able to calm down I asked my boss if I could leave early and he agreed. After getting home I noticed that my Facebook notifications had blown up, people were messaging me calling me a horrible person and that I was a child abuser. I live in a small town, sub 10k people, so everyone knows each other and this spread like wildfire.  \nOver the course of 2 days I lost over 50 facebook friends and the only people who believe I am innocent are my parents/family. I've also noticed dirty looks and coworkers not talking to me while at work.\n\n  \nFast forward to Friday, I get a long text from Ashley that says she took the baby to the doctor earlier in the week (Monday) and they told her it was a birthmark or skin pigmentation and the baby was fine. She said it took her so long to message me because she couldn't find the words to apologize for accusing me of being a child abuser. She has since deleted her facebook post about me and asked if we could meet in person.\n\n  \nI told her I never want to speak to her ever again, I have really bad anxiety now and my boss had mentioned he wanted to speak with me during my next shift (Monday). Ashley hasn't made a new post clearing my name so to the public I am still a child abuser.

Who doesn\u2019t notice a grapefruit sized birthmark on their own child?", "NTA. I can understand to have such a concern as a parent, but would never jump to public accusations without proof. Her not reaching out to explain and apologize, nor issue a public apology to match the public accusation speaks volumes. A real friend would admit fault as soon as possible-- she's disingenuous and doesn't deserve what sounds like a good friend like you.", "NTA\n\nShe accused you of a crime.

Sue her slander or defamation of character. Ruin her freakin life like she ruined yours. If she\u2019s not going to correct the story herself, then do it in court.

Never let this down until she faces the consequences of what she\u2019s done.", "NTA, and that's not a friend - quick to anger and public outbursts, but slow to forgive and even slower to tell everyone she did something horrendously wrong to clear up her mistakes.  It seems that to this point you've done the right thing with Ashley, and any of the other people who tormented you on her word probably should get the same treatment, because none of them seemed to contact you before believing Ashley's recounting of events.  It doesn't matter if she deleted it, genies can't be put back in bottles like that.  You just found out who a lot of people really are deep down, and when people tell you who they are through both actions and words, you should definitely believe them.\n\nAlso, if something happens at work that impacts your ability to earn a living, depending on where you live I might suggest having a chat with a lawyer just to see what your options are.  Ashley didn't think before acting when she thought you might have done something (after you helped her out, no less) and consider the consequences for YOU, but definitely has put thought about not going public and making HERSELF look just as bad as she made you look after accusing you of essentially one of the worst offenses that regular people can imagine, and I think people like that do not deserve any second chances or leniency.", "NTA make a post with her message and how you won't be speaking to her again. The fact that she never noticed a birth mark on her own child is ridiculous. She hasn't tried to take it back because she will receive backlash. Stop waiting and make the post with evidence.

You will want a paper trail of your innocence. And this might seem overkill, but your friends baby started developing a birth mark, which is normal and usually starts slowly showing over a couple of weeks, and **your friends didn't notice.** I would inform CPS that you were accused of child abuse due to them neglecting their babies hygiene. \n\nBecause again, **you need a paper trail to clear your name.** Ashley obviously isn't going to make a public statement because she knows the backlash is going to be severe. NTA I'm sorry you're experiencing this.", "NTA. She directly fucked with your public reputation in a tiny town, she should apologize to you publicly without any expectation of forgiveness.", "Sue her for defamation cuz wth was allat", "NTA", "NTA\n\nGet a lawyer and sue her. Financially damage this person to the fullest extent possible.", "take all the screenshots and sue her. Seriously, this is an easy case.", "NTA - an 8 month old baby is probably just at that awkward stage where they\u2019re crawling, possibly standing while leaning on things and possibly with some cruising. They can get bumps and bruises super easily at that stage for a thousand reasons unrelated to child abuse. The fact that she\u2019s jumped to the conclusion of child abuse and then gone immediately public with her accusations without even asking you about what happened first means she\u2019s no true friend and was willing to publicly ruin your life. \n\nTell her if there\u2019s any chance of you ever having any friendship again then as a minimum she needs to publicly apologise and clear your name. Her embarrassment does not trump your/your family\u2019s safety and your ability to earn a livelihood. If there\u2019s a risk you might lose your job and struggle to be rehired in that town then you might have to consider your legal position. The fact is nowadays employers run background checks that include social media searches and even though she might have deleted her post, there could be other posts out there talking about it and naming you that could get picked up.", "You need to speak with a lawyer.  Right the heck now.  You need to determine how to get Ashley to print a public retraction.  You also need to see what it would take to go after her for libel, defamation of character, whatever you can get her for.  What she did to you was seriously horrible.  Don't let it go.

You must be an absolute mess and justifiably and understandably so. \n\nYour \u201cfriend\u201d has also failed to recognise the seriousness on any level of what she put you through.\n\nI would NEVER speak to her again. I would seek professional therapy to work through this whole situation, so you can process everything that transpired in actuality and in your head during the accusation period and also so you can deal with the enormous betrayal by your \u201cfriend\u201d and loss of her.\n\nI would also - and this is really important - speak to a lawyer. She has egregiously defamed you and has no defence to it. She MUST make a public post apologising and stating the facts as reported by the doctor, and must also contact relevant people to tell them directly. She must confirm she has made no approach to the police or, if she has, issue a formal retraction with the supporting evidence. A lawyer can assist you ensuring all this happens. Otherwise she can face a lawsuit. In fact, she probably should face one and be paying compensation anyway, because in the situation you have described, her properly undoing the harm is going to be difficult.\n\nShe does not deserve you, your time, your empathy or your sympathy.\n\nSending you love, support and hugs.", "NTA.

It's so messed up. Something else I don't understand is that if it was a bruise as her friend originally thought, wouldn't the baby start crying/being in discomfort when it was touched? Surely the fact that the baby seemed fine should be a sign that it wasn't a bruise or an injury. \n\nI may sound very cynical here, but I get the feeling the friend wanted to make a big deal of it and create drama. Maybe she's jealous of OP in some way or something. The fact that she leaped to that conclusion out of nowhere makes me think it was done on purpose to ruin OP's reputation. And the fact that it took her 4 days to apologise just makes me feel like she's doing it more out of obligation than any genuine guilt. \n\nOP, I'm really sorry you're going through this. I'm sure that others have suggested this, but I think you should take screenshots of her \"apology\" message and put it on Facebook for everyone to see the truth.

My 2nd baby had one and I noticed it at a week old about an hour before my midwife was coming to check on him, I had a full blown freak out and panic attack that I'd somehow bruised my baby and she was going to think I'd abused him. My husband stayed home from work so he could support me during the appointment and I told the midwife about the \"bruise\" through floods of tears and that I didn't understand where it came from because I'd never hurt my baby.... she took one look and giggled because it wasn't a bruise and I was crying for nothing. She even noted it down in his well child book so my mind was at ease. \n\nHe's 6 now and every so often my husband will look at him and ask \"is that a bruise?\" And we laugh like idiots.", "But that's not an explanation of how the mother didn't know there was a mark on her baby. You're saying it can go from nothing to full bloom in 24 hours? Since she last bathed the baby? That's the question being asked", "Surely they'd notice it developing? We all noticed my sister's slowly appearing."]}
