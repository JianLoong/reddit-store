I said it was kind of disrespectful to her and her job, and that he was just setting himself up for disappointment.

I'm definitely not hating on your friend, and perhaps even respect his confidence, but as an ex server and current SW, I can tell you that there's a line. \n\nSome people recognise that we're being paid to be nice to them and still manage to be polite, respectful, interesting, and not cringe. These people can actually be fun and a pleasure to work with, sometimes. These people seem to recognise the humanity in every person they meet. These people know that we're just doing our jobs and that we don't want to be asked out on shift. These people do not cross the line.\n\nSome people mis-read signals. Some mistake the practised charm for genuine interest. Some people get weird. Some get entitled and think we owe them something (and this happens in all 'service industry' roles). Some people just don't know how to behave. Maybe because they've had a sheltered life, or a disconnected or traumatic upbringing. Maybe they've been so 'othered' themselves, that they can only 'other'... others. Maybe some people are just assholes. Some people often cross the lines. Some of these people can make us scared because of the jobs we do, or upset us to the point of hating ourselves.\n\nPlease don't get me wrong - I try not to judge the latter, and nor do I think things are so black and white as to put people into one category or the other. Sometimes people just need pointing in the right direction. But I do know that I and colleagues around me develop a filter which helps us to parse the customers and clients we encounter into such categories. Because sometimes it makes our jobs easier, and sometimes it straight up keeps us alive. \n\nSo no, you're definitely not the asshole, and honestly, I know a lot of people in these industries who appreciate people like you for calling out their friends and holding them to account. That's the deifinition of an ally. \n\nAnd your friend? Maybe they're an asshole. Or maybe they've just got some learning to do. I hope it's the latter, I hope you stay strong enough to keep calling friends out and redirecting them where necessary, and I hope we see more people like you asking these questions in clubs, bars, restaurants, shops, on planes and on trains, in hotels and in hospitals...\n\nThanks for not being the asshole.\n\nJess xx", "NTA your friend is literally the type of guy who thinks a stripper is into him just for doing their job.

Deciding to pursue someone when they're literally less free to act on their own accord, to respond as they truly would want to, is choosing to pursue the sick antelope in the herd, because it can't evade as well as the healthy ones.", "It can be an extremely uncomfortable position to be in as the employee, they are under obligation to be friendly and customer service oriented while in the workplace. It can be a bit of a hostage situation where you can't simply leave if someone is crossing a line because you are on the clock and still have to perform your job.\n\nIt's definitely a known rule of thumb to not hit on employees, being polite and friendly is part of the job it doesn't mean they are into you.", "If a person is paid to be nice and their livelihood depends on having happy customers it's absolutely not okay to ask them out while they're working.\n\nBad reviews, complaints to the manager, losing a job, even stalking and violence can result from turning down someone who doesn't handle rejection well. So yeah, it can cause some anxiety to be placed in the position of having to let someone down gently. Don't do that to people.", "When people are working, they don\u2019t have the luxury of leaving when they are uncomfortable. They can\u2019t even be blunt and unfriendly without risking their jobs. Too many businesses/ managers out there value their customers over their employees and refuse to penalize customers who abuse staff.\n\n  All of this creates a power imbalance that means that it is gross to ask out someone who is working. If you do that, you are taking advantage of the power imbalance on purpose to get the outcome that you want. \n\n  The absolute most forward thing a person should do is leave their phone number on a receipt and then walk out. If you get a phone call, awesome, if not move on. And honestly even that is pushing it.", "Clocked in to work. Period. Shouldn't matter what that job is. Nurse, elementary school teacher, nuclear physicist. They are there to DO A JOB.  There are dozens of dating apps, or nightlife situations where it's appropriate to ask someone out. While they are at work is absolutely not one of them.", "Yes, it is gross. \n\nNo one should ask out someone at their place of employment.", "YOU don't see the harm because YOU get to walk away. Because YOUR JOB does not depend on the interaction. YOU can tell someone to fork off, YOU can never go back to the business. That's not the same for the employee. \n\nMaybe you think that you are innocent and benign, but the person you are harassing may not think so, so do right by them and leave them alone.", "If the person is in a position of customer service its awkward because they have to remain nice, friendly, and polite no matter how creepy the person is asking them/harrassing them", "do you know literally any women irl?", "Welp you are just an idiot then", "This sub seems to be absolutely full of angry SJWs, so don\u2019t take it personally. I think most people in the real world would have a different opinion.", "I do somewhat get your point.  I do think it boils down more to how they are getting their income.  If their compensation directly results from you (i.e. commissions, tips, singles in a g-string....), then asking them out in the middle of working is much more inappropriate because there is a power imbalance.  Otherwise, I actually agree with your method, be short, sweet and willing to immediately accept \"no\" as a full sentence/response.", "I'm glad I wasn't the only one who thought this.\n\nI'm married now, but when I dated, I dated with the intent to marry. I was not killing time or just having fun, the purpose of the first date was to essentially interview each other to see where our compatibilities and our differences were. If compatibilities outweighed differences and none of the differences were instant \"no-gos,\" then the process proceeded.\n\nI've now been married for almost 11 years with two kids.", "Yup there have been plenty of AITAs here of male restaurant servers being harassed", "What a world, where barely adults strip and grind on strangers so they can afford an education and you don't even bat an eye to that.", "Technically you don't go to a stripclub for a woman to play your girlfriend, or therapist. It's just for a dance and some chatter, drinks, looking at naked bodies. With -that- clich\u00e9 and label in mind, I find it quite cringe too.  \nJust that, going to a strip club for the sole purpose of ogling women. I find that quite nasty, but I don't know what goes on in stripclubs, I've never been into one.. It makes sense that some guys go in there for some type of needs they can't find in their lives. But it's not the first thing one thinks off when it comes to going to a strip club.\n\nAlso there's professions for that, there's actually professional huggers (it has an actual name I sadly forgot). I'm dead serious hahaha, you can hire someone to spend time with you. To hug/cuddle/spoon etcetera for x amount of hours.", "Still cringe. Imagine dating a guy that frequents strip clubs. Big L.", "I agree", "I think it\u2019s weird to hit on strippers or dancers. Their job is to perform and entertain. They\u2019re not there to \u201cmeet\u201d someone. Same for a server. Their job is to be nice to you and bring you your food. Not find a date. So it\u2019s just weird to ask them out and put them in an uncomfortable spot. There is a power dynamic because the customer is paying for a service being rendered. If the customer doesn\u2019t understand those boundaries, it makes everything weird.\n\nThat said, I wouldn\u2019t talk to my friends about it the way OP did. A simple \u201chey don\u2019t do that, it makes people uncomfortable and can be creepy.\u201d I don\u2019t think telling friend he\u2019s cringe is effective. But maybe I\u2019m just not clued in on what cringe is these days.", "Or any place. People don't want to be hit on at their job.", "I've worked in customer service and it is true that I'd rather not be hit on at work, but it happens and how inappropriate it feels depends a lot on how the person asking behaves. Like I won't get upset if someone politely asks and then accepts \"no\" as an answer. The only time I have an issue when the guy gets rude about or tries to be cheeky instead of being polite.\n\nI mean lets say you meet your dream person while they are at work and the only place you see them is at their work place.. How would you ask them out? Or would you just skip the person who might be the love of your life just because you only meet them at the place they work? And please don't say \"I'd wait for their shift to end and meet them outside\". That gives instant stalker vibes and is much, much, much worse than being asked out while working.  \n\n\nEdit: typos", "Good thing my dad didn't feel that way or me and my brothers wouldn't be here lol. They were married for 50 years too, until he passed last year...", "Yeah I didn\u2019t think about the fact that she was working, it\u2019s annoying when people make advances on people in the service industry. My bad for saying that.", "Rip to those men", "The sick antelope is such a great metaphor for this situation haha", "Absolutely delusional. How many married couple do you think first met when one or both of them was at work?", "Exactly. From some of the responses I've seen on this thread people seem to think you should only be asking out people in your friend group you have known for years. When did first dates being about 2 strangers getting to know each other to check for compatibility change because I apparently missed that memo.", "That makes sense but at the same time I'm kinda thinking it doesn't have to be on creepy stuff, maybe he was just like I'm gonna go for it cause I might not see her again idk. Maybe I'm giving him too much credit it just doesn't seem weird, ive seen guys get asked out at work and it seemed pretty normal but then again I'd probably think it was weird if I saw a woman get asked out at work.", "Thank you.. I feel the same way and waiting around until their shift ends would be 1000 times worse...", "Doesn't change that for the overwhelmingly vast majority of people they don't want to be asked out while they're working and are putting on a show for the job. \n\nYour own personal experience doesn't override the rest of reality. \n\nI feel like you're being deliberately obtuse not understanding that 51 years ago... Was 51 years ago. Also other factors matter like the size of their town, age (both high schoolers from the same high school, both college age from the same college, etc) and more. \n\nYour response shows why people are forced into these uncomfortable and sometimes dangerous situations \"bEcAuSe My PaReNtS dId It\".", "Good for your parents, but that was 50+ years ago. The world has moved on past that point.", "RIP to which men?", "To who??? The ones willing paying lol", "For every cute couple that this worked for, there are a hundred stories from employees about creepy people taking advantage of the fact that the employee HAS to be nice and can't just leave to ask them out. The exception proves the rule. CAN it be done in a non creepy way? Yep, absolutely. But 99% of the time it isn't.", "Here\u2019s a hint for functioning in the world: Just because something happens doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s right. \n\nAlso - clocked out and not working is far different than asking someone out while they are actively earning money at the place that keeps them housed and fed. So, two teachers who meet at school and one asks the other out outside of work hours is far different than some creep coming into a store and asking out an employee who is stuck there.", "Yeah, OP said friend was respectful and didn\u2019t make a big deal about it when she declined. It doesn\u2019t sound like \u201ccringe\u201d to me. It comes across that said friend is ignorant or naive and hopefully learns from this experience.", "I think a lot of you are being unrealistic in the fact that yes this is very common and it's not ALWAYS unwelcome... even in this current time. It honestly depends on the person doing the asking and the one getting asked and how any rejection is handled. \n\nGuys, girls or NB.. waiters, waitresses, personal trainers, cashiers, store managers etc. Not everyone goes to clubs or does online dating. Believe it or not some people ask out random people they run into during their day even if that person is working.", "I think they are making a negative statement about dancers and relationships.", "Why are you so offended by everything? So angry, such a victim complex.", "Don't ask people out who are being paid to be nice to you. It's so creepy!", "And believe it or not, you're being disrespectful by doing that. You need to understand that the current landscape younger people are navigating is not your landscape. \n\nYou again are being very narrow minded about the situations that can arise from this. Someone \"shooting their shot\" can wreck someone's entire day because 10 other people did the same disrespectful thing. \n\nPeople are working these low wage jobs and (often, especially waitressing) degrading jobs to make it day-to-day. To survive. And maybe just because they're kind of pretty they don't need someone who can't navigate tinder making their day worse. \n\nRespect people. Respect their jobs. They're not there for a booty call or to fulfill someone's rom-com fantasy.", "You\u2019re the one who is super defensive here. I\u2019m actually just fine.\n\nThere was no anger in my reply to you at all.\n\nBless your heart.", "Would you speak to your boss like that? Your mother?  Thought not.", "I literally would to both. Nothing I said was mean and I would state everything I said to both of them.\n\nAre you that big of a baby to not speak your mind (with no cursing or threats) in front of people?\n\nAnyway I\u2019m done wasting my time with you because you seem honestly pathetic. Muting replies so keep yelling at no one.", "Can you Not be a dumbass? Thought not."]}
