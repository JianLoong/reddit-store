I'm definitely not hating on your friend, and perhaps even respect his confidence, but as an ex server and current SW, I can tell you that there's a line. \n\nSome people recognise that we're being paid to be nice to them and still manage to be polite, respectful, interesting, and not cringe. These people can actually be fun and a pleasure to work with, sometimes. These people seem to recognise the humanity in every person they meet. These people know that we're just doing our jobs and that we don't want to be asked out on shift. These people do not cross the line.\n\nSome people mis-read signals. Some mistake the practised charm for genuine interest. Some people get weird. Some get entitled and think we owe them something (and this happens in all 'service industry' roles). Some people just don't know how to behave. Maybe because they've had a sheltered life, or a disconnected or traumatic upbringing. Maybe they've been so 'othered' themselves, that they can only 'other'... others. Maybe some people are just assholes. Some people often cross the lines. Some of these people can make us scared because of the jobs we do, or upset us to the point of hating ourselves.\n\nPlease don't get me wrong - I try not to judge the latter, and nor do I think things are so black and white as to put people into one category or the other. Sometimes people just need pointing in the right direction. But I do know that I and colleagues around me develop a filter which helps us to parse the customers and clients we encounter into such categories. Because sometimes it makes our jobs easier, and sometimes it straight up keeps us alive. \n\nSo no, you're definitely not the asshole, and honestly, I know a lot of people in these industries who appreciate people like you for calling out their friends and holding them to account. That's the deifinition of an ally. \n\nAnd your friend? Maybe they're an asshole. Or maybe they've just got some learning to do. I hope it's the latter, I hope you stay strong enough to keep calling friends out and redirecting them where necessary, and I hope we see more people like you asking these questions in clubs, bars, restaurants, shops, on planes and on trains, in hotels and in hospitals...\n\nThanks for not being the asshole.\n\nJess xx", "NTA your friend is literally the type of guy who thinks a stripper is into him just for doing their job.

The boss wasn't available & his secretary asked if she could help. I didn't want to subject her to my father's wrath, but I did lay it out for her. She was appalled. And, while we were talking, DUDE CALLED ME AGAIN on the other line. I put him on hold & clicked back to tell her. She put me on hold, got her boss out of whatever he was doing & filled him in. Got back on the phone with me and said her boss was going down the hall to talk to the dude. The hold light on my phone went out, so he had disconnected that call.

When they are working is one of those situations. \n\nThere is absolutely never nothing wrong with asking someone out if you are single, the problem is how you do it and the place and pace for it. A strip club is obviously a place meant for this, and most strippers ive meet have offered a dating service type thing for a change. Some for free, they are human after all.\n\n>A stripper is acting the part of someone who is actually into a customer -- how on earth is reading her \"body language\" going to let someone know that she isn't interested in them? \n\nStrippers are NOT acting that much, its way to demanding of a job. Generally speaking if they dont find you attractive and you arent incredibly rich they wont go near you. Its still a SEX job after all.\n\n>If you ask her out at work, all you are doing is asking for her to give you those things for free.\n\nI know, but im offering the same for free, and if they like then thats a starting point. They have willingly offered it to me for free, I cant help it if some found me attractive enough for that.\n\nIll even rub it in a bit, I once showed a stripper my cock (after talking about it of course, I was a bit insecure, just ended a bad relationship) on my phone and she said, for that ill do it for less than half price. She was an extremely nice person and helped me heal.

I have asked a girl out who works at a gym while I was there and that went well.  She was quite happy.  Same with another store.  Its about time and place and use your best judgement to determine if there is a conflict of interest.\n\nAlso judging the situation, don't stand there and chat or really even bother is she is really busy.  Find a time when its not so busy, introduce yourself and ask.  People working have things to do, so don't take up their time.
