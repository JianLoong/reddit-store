Her eldest loves comic books and my bf lets him read some of his collection. They aren't like vintage comic books they are the big book versions you can get after a series of comics have been published and contains them all.\n\nWell, one time they came over and my bf was out, her eldest asked if he could read some of the comics and I said no since my bf isn\u2019t here. He didn\u2019t seem to care but my sister pushed and said they\u2019re just comics, I again told her no.\n\nWell at one point I had to go out to grab something to make dinner for us. While I was gone she told her son that I had changed my mind and that he can go read some of the comics.\n\nHe went into the room and started reading, when I got back I asked where he was and she told me he was reading comics, I was annoyed and told her I said no, she said he was always careful and I told her that didn\u2019t matter and to go tell him to stop and come back down. She huffed but I insisted so she went upstairs to tell him,\n\nSoon after she went upstairs I heard a scream and rushed upstairs. My bf does own a lot of comics but he arguably owns a lot more bl manga, the spicy kind, and instead of grabbing a comic he had grabbed and was reading one of them.\n\nMy sister was screaming and grabbed it from him asking why the hell did I own something like this when I knew kids are often in this environment. I reminded her that two adult men live here with no kids. She said that it didn\u2019t matter and insinuated that my bf had been letting her son read these kinds of things which is not true.\n\nShe tore out some of the pages of the manga and told me she was leaving, I told her she would have to pay to replace the manga but she refused and left. She is now texting me that I need to apologize for traumatizing her child, I told her it is her fault and I told her no multiple times.\n\nBut now our mother has gotten involved and told me I should have explained when I said no that it was because my bf also owns comics not suitable for children and that I was being rude by dismissing her, so AITA?\n\nEDIT: spelling\n\nEDIT 2: wow never thought id be giving out bl recommendations in an AITA comment section but here i am lol", "created_utc": 1684150770, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13i5qur/aita_for_telling_my_sister_its_her_fault_that_her/", "score": 326, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I am shocked, I say. Appalled even. /s\n\nSeriously, she didn't accept a no, then met the dildo of consequence to which her reaction was actively vandalising someone else's property WHILE moving the goalposts of her patently absurd argument. Oh, and of course she was fazed that you were \"being rude\" or \"dismissive\" after she literally has been ignoring your objections constantly and even went behind your back. And now it's your fault that she let her kid do something unsupervised against which you objected...\n\nI think there is a word for a person like that with an anatomical association, but I can't seem to remember.\n\nFunny how bad parents never seem to see when it's their fault...\n\nNTA.", "NTA, and I would absolutely not back down an inch.  Your mother is way out of line (undoubtedly because your sister lied to her about how things happened).\n\nBTW, you nephew isn't traumatized by the manga - if anything he's traumatized by his mother's f\\*cked up reaction to the problem she created", "NTA - Why the hell should you have to explain there is spicy stuff in your bf's Manga collection?? Maybe he's, I don't know, PRIVATE about that?? It's absolutely her fault and maybe she should learn to respect your extremely clear and reasonable boundaries. Honestly, the audacity, un-freaking-real.", "NTA. You said \u201cno,\u201d and she ignored you. Everything that happens after that is her fault. After all, now she knows why your nephew doesn\u2019t get to read the comics without your BF there. \n\nAs far as the manga goes: she 100% needs to pay to replace it. Whether she approves of it or not, it was not hers and she damaged it (and that is what she gets for the assumption that all comics are for kids).\n\nEdit: your mother is 100% wrong - you said \u201cno\u201d and that should have ended the argument right then and there. No one should have to explain a \u201cno\u201d for someone to respect it.", "NTA - She went behind your back and gave her child access to something that she had no right to in your home. Then she had the audacity to destroy someone else's property. She owes you and your boyfriend an apology, and the cost of replacing the manga.", "NTA, wow your sister she a piece of work. Hopefully she doesn\u2019t have anymore kids. Maybe she bring things to entertain her kids during visits, that what a normal organized parents would do at a home with no kids. She set herself up.", "NTA, no means no and she fully lied to her kid in saying you\u2019d changed your mind, so it\u2019s on her. It would have been helpful to tell her that your comics were not appropriate for a child and it is not good that said child unwittingly read adult comics. But it isn\u2019t your fault - the \u201cno\u201d should\u2019ve been enough. She could have always asked as well whether the comics were inappropriate for her kid to read or smth.", "NTA. He'll already have been subjected far worse in the world than a spicy manga, mumma surely can't be that naive?\n\nShe owes you the cost.", "NTA - Regardless of the outcome. You said no and SIL decided that because your answer wasn\u2019t what she wanted, she overruled it\u2026 while you weren\u2019t there, so she knew what she did was wrong. She\u2019s just using the adult content to redirect blame away from her own behaviour.", "NTA.\n\nYou said no. That should have ended the subject.", "NTA. How's your nephews and nieces going to learn accountability if your sister can't even establish it. This was firm FAFO territory for them. You warned them and said no multiple times, too.", "You explained everything required when you told her not when my boyfriend isn't here. NTA", "NTA, she shouldn't let her kid snoop around somewhere nobody let them. And you shouldn't have explained anything. \"No\" is a complete sentence, after that she should've just accepted the no and move on.", "NTA - 100% her fault. In some countries what she did would check considered trespass. She went beyond the purpose of being allowed in the house. \n\nYou clearly told her no and she did it anyway. It\u2019s entirely her fault. \n\nAlso seeing porn at 12 isn\u2019t the biggest deal. I think most people have seen a bit by then and if this is the first time then the kid is probably luckier than most", "NTA, \n\nHer own fault. Tell her to reimburse you for the manga, she will shut up real quick.", "nta.  You said no and she overrode you without your knowledge making any fallout her own fault.", "NTA\n\nYou said NO! She didn't respect YOUR decision in YOUR home, that you didn't need to explain! The comics aren't even yours, so it isn't even your place to allow anyone to read them.\n\nShe destroyed your BF's property because she didn't like that her blantand ignorance for boundaries lead to her son reading something she doesn't approve of. \n\nThat's all on her and for me it would be a hill to die own to have your sister pay for the damage she caused WITH intention. And for all the family members that try to put the blame on you, ask them if it is okay if you or your BF damage any of there stuff if you dislike it.", "NTA no means no, end of", "NTA. She's looking to blame you for her shitty parenting.", "no, you are not the asshole because your sister ignored you telling her \"no\" and her kid ended up reading your boyfriend's cartoon pornography.", "Nta. Sounds like an entitled parents story.", "NTA. You said no, it is just bad parenting on her part. She should pay for what she destroyed.", "NTA. Your nephew accepted the \u201cno\u201d from the get-go. Your sister doesn\u2019t understand that \u201cNo\u201d IS a complete sentence.\n\nYour mother, suddenly, seems to have conveniently forgotten that fact, as well.\n\nYour boyfriend should send your sister an itemized bill of what it will cost to replace the damaged items and if she refuses, take her to court.\n\nYour mother should be presented with the option to pay for the damaged items, herself. Otherwise, she should be advised to kindly keep her nose out of matters that don\u2019t involve her, tell her daughter to put on her big girl pants and take responsibility for her actions or, even better, BOTH.\n\nEdit: cleaned up some typos", "Nta, if she ever asks to come over again, tell her that she can't until you put locks on some doors because she can't seem to understand the answer no.", "NTA. She\u2019s not allowed over until she replaces it", "Idk how far you're willing to take this, but depending on the value of the Manga you could take this to small claims court to teach her a solid lesson. She fucked around and found out, only to respond by fucking around more? Hell nah, NTA.", "NTA.\n\nAnd send her the link to this. She is way off base. She allowed her child free reign on a private and personal collection. Not one leg to stand on.", "NTA, wow, entitled doesn't even begin to describe it. Scratch her name off the visitors list. Next time it could be worse!!", "NTA: No means No and I hope your BF files small claims.", "NTA, your sister is.", "NTA - you told her no for a reason and she should have left it at that.", "No means no. \n\nNTA", "NTA. When you say No you shouldn't need to explain. That should be enough for her to respect.", "NTA \n\nThe nerve of some people! \n\nYour sister is adult who decided to not hear your no because it was an inconvenience to her at the time. Now she\u2019ll have to do what all adults need to do from time to time: be responsible for the outcome of our choices.\n\nShe should apologize to her own kid and your bf. But also replace what she broke.", "NTA, you said no and I seriously doubt the boy was \"traumatized\" by anything other than his mother's massive overreaction.", "NTA - you set a boundary repeatedly that you could not provide access to someone else's property and she trampled all over it. I'm holding the child blameless because at 12, you tend to think if parent gives permission it is ok. You shouldn't have to give any reason beyond no, they are not mine. It is not rude to protect someone's private property. It is rude as a guest to assume that you can do what you like in someone else's house.\n\nAnd then your sister started reaching for the stars in her assumptions, trying to make your BF into someone who was showing her child \"spicy stuff\". I really wouldn't let her back in after those accusations and the property damage.\n\nAlso doubt child is traumatised. He is about the age sadly where a lot of children start watching porn on the internet and suspect the mangas milder than a lot of that. Edit: More likely to be traumatised by his mother's reaction of clutching her pearls and screaming than being willing to discuss anything that shocked him.", "info: why would you need to explain your 'no' to an adult? \n\nno is a no, and if your sister is not capable of understanding and respecting that... well she found out that there are unpleasant consequences to ignoring that \ud83d\ude02", "NTA!  So, 'no' is a complete sentence and the only explanation that should be needed.  She's the cause of her sons \"trauma.\"  She went behind your back when you were gone, knowing you wouldn't agree.   She's a true piece of work.  Also, it's your home, with your boyfriend therefore you don't have to explain anything that you have in your home.  Amd you're allowed to have whatever you want in your own home!", "NTA\n\nAn adult is allowed to own whatever they want regardless of who comes to their house. Sure, don\u2019t display porn out in the open, but this was a spicy book in somebody\u2019s room\n\nPlus, you didn\u2019t say no bc of the spicy books, you said no bc it was your husband\u2019s stuff and he wasn\u2019t there. Sure, he may not have cared, but you said no and that should be that. A grown woman and a 12 year old should be able to handle no.", "So your sister asked if her kid could read bf\u2019s comics. You said no because bf was out and the comics did not belong to you. The kid made no complaint. Then as soon as you were gone, your sister lies to her kid and tells him to help himself. Now she\u2019s mad because the kid saw something he shouldn\u2019t. And somehow this is your fault? You are NTA here. Your sister is. You did not owe her an explanation for why her kid could not read the comics. You said no because they do not belong to you and that is reason enough.", "NTA. Your sister let her ~~brat~~ good kid read a book that was the property of another person who wasn't there to give his permission. She didn't check the suitability of the book first. She then vandalized a book that did not belong to her.\n\nYour sister is prime r/entitledparents material and needs to learn that the world does not revolve around her, nor around her children.", "ESH, heavy on your sister, light on you.\n\nShe was clearly not going to listen to you when you said no. You should have given her a good reason, should have been enough to say some of it was NSFW and you didn't know which ones. 1000% undeniably her fault at that point.\n\nHeavy on her because.. well, what everyone else said.", "NTA she fucked around and found out. And she damaged your property. She sucks \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f sorry about your comic OP but I\u2019m glad you\u2019re finding humor in the situation.", "NTA make her pay to replace what she damaged.", "No is a full sentence. Definitely NTA. I don\u2019t think a 12yo would be traumatised by some BL, but your sister is not good at communicating with her kids. I hope it wasn\u2019t your bf fave manga which she damaged. Your sister is an AH.", "Or.. or, stay with me here\u2026. No means no. Without any in-depth explanations as to why. \n\n*gasp*\n\nSeriously, she was told no, fucked around and found out. NTA", "NTA. Could you have said that there were things in the collection that aren't suitable for children? Yes, absolutely. But no still means no, and your sister should have respected that.\n\nI can understand why she'd be upset, but it's totally her own fault.", "NTA. It is her fault. Do not apologize and definitely follow up in collecting the money she owes your boyfriend for damaging his property.", "NTA you said no, that should have been the end of it. Your sister allowed him access to someone else\u2019s stuff behind your back", "NTA\n\nLiterally doesn't matter why you said no.  No means no.  \n\nShe did this to herself.  \n\nThe son doesn't sound traumatized anyways.", "NTA. I don\u2019t think you should let your sister over until she apologizes. She obviously has no respect for other peoples\u2019 belongings and boundaries. She had no right to let her son read the comics when you obviously refused permission.", "NTA, you are completely in the right, it's her fault, she should teach her kid to respect privacy and boundaries, and she should pay to replace the manga she ruined.\n\nBut mostly, I want to say thank you, OP! It is so refreshing to read an AITA that is amusing and features an obvious AH, but where no serious harm is done.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOur sister is the AH .. Don't let them enter your home ever again until she has apologizes and replaced the damage.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd tell your mom to butt out, she is wrng and an AH for guilting you about it.", "NTA\n\n I'm not familiar with manga, so idk how \"spicy\" the content was. But unless the boy is homeschooled and with no friends, i'm gonna go ahead and assume there's nothing he didn't know already. \n\n She is the one that let him read in your house without your approval. She has no right to tell you what books to own. If she minds so much, well maybe she can start by not letting her kid to roam in the house unsupervised. And she does have to pay for that book. Your mother is wrong. Your sister was the rude one.", "Nta. Someone needs to teach your sister that no means no.", "NTA. You told the boy no. Your sister (when you were out of the house), basically lied to her own kid and said you\u2019d changed your mind. Absolutely any \u201ctrauma\u201d the boy experienced by having his mom catch him with something (in her view) inappropriate,is entirely on your sister. She caused the situation by allowing him to read your bfs collection unsupervised and then overreacted massively.", "NTA. Any \u201ctrauma\u201d he experienced from reading spicy manga is solely on her for lying to him and saying it was okay. She\u2019s a grown woman, she shouldn\u2019t need an explanation when she\u2019s told no.", "Sis needs to pay up and replace that book.", "NTA. Her child isn't traumatized by the manga. He's \"traumatized\" about his mom catching him.", "NTA! Your sister is just deflecting the blame to feel better about herself. Hopefully this will teach her to respect boundaries \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f.", "No is a complete sentence. You owe no one any further reasoning.", "NTA\n\nIf it was me I would have warned her some of the comics/manga were for adults. But \"no\" should have been enough regardless and it's the height of entitlement that she screamed at you after going behind your back.\n\nAnd then she topped it off by destroying your bf's property... You deserve an apology.", "L tell your sister that it's her fault that her son was up there looking at those comic books. Because no means f****** know no does it mean wait until the the person leaves the room and then you go and tell the child they can do what you told them they could not do this is her f****** fault and you are not the a****** do not apologize", "NTA.  This is ridiculous.  Sounds like your sister should not be allowed over any more, since she can't respect the word, \"no\"", "\"No\" is a complete sentence.  Sis literally LIED to her kid and that lie led to the damaging of his fragile psyche.  OP, you have zero culpability.  \n\nNTA", "NTA \n\nHe was told they were off-limits.", "NTA. \n\nWhat the hell kind of 12YO is \"traumatized\" by reading something with dirty pictures?

OP you\u2019re NTA", "I don't really think its worth that, I don't want to ruin my relationship plus the manga was less than 15 quid. while my bf is  bummed his manga got destroyed he's using as an excuse to get more as our local manga shop has a premiant 3for 2 deal on manga so he always gets 3 at a time. he also finds it kinda funny bc the one the kid picked out is no where near the worst he owns.", "There\u2019s definitely some veiled or internalise homophobia going on here.
