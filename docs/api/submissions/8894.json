It works out great for us. \n\nMy wife has two kids from before.  They also love Disneyland.  When we go as a family we get faster access to some rides together and when they want to go on a ride he doesn't like my wife can wait in line with them and we meet up afterwards.  Sometimes we switch and my wife will take my son around while I wait in line with my stepkids.  \n\nHowever when my wife or one of my sister's can't come with us I just take my son.  My wife has also taken just her kids when my son doesn't want to go.  We have also taken just my stepkids and left my son with my sisters when he didn't feel like going out in public.\n\nThis last weekend I had time to go to the park and my son asked.  I asked my wife but she didn't want to go.  I checked with my sisters but they were busy. So I took my son without my stepkids.  \n\nWhen we got home my in-laws were there fighting with my wife.  The kids had called them and said I was excluding them from going to Disneyland.  The thing is they never volunteer to watch the kids when we go.  They hate the crowds and the lines.  \n\nThey said that I'm treating their grandchildren like they are less important than my son.  My wife who was dealing with a migraine was almost in tears.  \n\nI helped my son get cleaned up and put him to bed.  Then I came back and tore a strip off of them.  I said that their grandkids are children and do not understand yet why they cannot always get their way, but that they are adults and presumably are able to understand why I couldn't take the three kids by myself.  I couldn't leave my son and my stepkids are too young to wander the park by themselves.  I volunteered to take them next time so THEY could watch their grandchildren while I took care of my son. Or they could watch my son and I would wait in line with the kids.  \n\nThey said they didn't want to do that but still said I was being an asshole not taking their grandchildren. \n\nSo I presented another option.  They could pay for a helper to come with us for the day.  That way if my wife can't come I can still take the kids.  I did ask that they also pay for the days I could not go so my wife could take all three kids.  \n\nThey said that I was being ridiculous.  So I told them unless they were willing to help they could stay the fuck out of how we did things in our family.  \n\nI went and talked to the kids and told them that I understood why they called their grandparents but that they had to learn that sometimes they would have to not go to stuff until they were old enough to be safe by themselves.   I made sure they knew I wasn't mad at them and said that I would take them the next time I could schedule it.  \n\nMy wife said I was right in how I handled stuff but that her parents were mad at me for putting them in their place.", "created_utc": 1675285344, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10r62gu/aita_for_not_taking_my_stepkids_to_disneyland/", "score": 220, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You clearly have done all the options at various times (just son, just stepkids, all together) so it's not like you are always just taking your son and leaving them out. Plus this wasn't the typical once-or-twice-in-a-lifetime Disney trip. You obviously live nearby and so this is more just a regular outing.\n\nThe grandparents are assholes for interfering. As a grandparent myself, I cannot imagine doing things like this, which would only make it less likely that I would be a major part of my grandkids' lives. I'm really suspicious about why your kids called the grandparents anyway, as though they knew the grandparents would take their side. I'm wondering if statements about \"he's so unfair\" are happening from grandparents to your stepkids when you aren't around.", "NTA - \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f", "NTA. \n\nIt sounds like there are times when they all go without the other.

That's why I reassured them that I understood why they called and that I wasn't mad at them.", "They are young kids.", "I don't think it the same", "They are young kids.

My wife wasn't feeling well and no one was available to help us with the kids. So I took my son.", "Not if he has appropriate care.", "They are children, and they don\u2019t know how difficult taking three kids alone would be. Maybe next time try not to say things in front of the kids, but I stand by NTA. The grandparents are acting as immature as children themselves.", "How is it not the same? Because they don't get to use their stepbrother for shorter wait times?", "Turn them off. They have no say in what goes on between you and your spouse. You guys are in agreement. That\u2019s the end of the convo. Partner needs to have a word and if that\u2019s not enough you simply stop responding. That\u2019s all you can do.", "1) Okay, thanks, I see why those ages make things complicated.\n\n2) But has this happened only when your son wasn't interested in going to begin with, or does he also sometimes have to stand back even when he wants to go?", "But you leave them behind from things they do want to attend", "I never once have forced the kids to go to Disneyland.", "So you left the other two kids home with your wife who was not feeling well to handle on her own?", "Because in both example where the stepbrother didn't come it was because he didn't want to go", "To be 100% honest it has never come up.

Like how my seven year old cousin wants to go bungee jumping because it looks so fun, but she isn't allowed to due to her age.\n\nOP didn't leave the stepchildren home because they didn't want them to come, but because it wasn't safe. They have been to the park without OP's son before, so it's not like they get less time, and looking after three children unable to take care of themselves isn't easy, especially at an amusement park and if one of the children has a disability.  \nTaking them all would be a safety issue, and those go before hurt feelings. It sucks not to do something you want to right now, sure, but they do need to learn to deal with that.", "I didn't say that. \n\nI said the step kids do not get to choose if they want to go or not. \n\nIf you don't have a helper they can't go even if they want to.

And sometimes I watch all three kids when I'm at home and she is at work and I feel like crap.", "Aah, I see. In that case, NTA. \n\nHowever, please consider that this could *look* like you're favoring him even though you are not.

My stepkids have gotten to go on days when the only available help was one of my sister's watching him at home while myself or my wife took them.", "So on the days my son cannot go then they can't go either right?", "Unfortunately my son isn't going to be around forever.  If he wants a day out and I can provide it then he gets it.", "It doesn't sound like Disney land is a once in a lifetime event for this family - if it were a huge trip and it took a decade for another chance I'd agree, but if they're doing weekend trips fairly frequently it's likely they'll get a chance to go soon.", "The way you wrote your post says the only time your son doesn't go is when he doesn't want too. But if he wanted to and they wouldn't accommodate him then yeah they should stay home", "My bad man I didn't know by disabled that's what you meant. I change my judgement then.", "It hasn't come up.
