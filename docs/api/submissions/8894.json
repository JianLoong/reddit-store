It works out great for us. \n\nMy wife has two kids from before.  They also love Disneyland.  When we go as a family we get faster access to some rides together and when they want to go on a ride he doesn't like my wife can wait in line with them and we meet up afterwards.  Sometimes we switch and my wife will take my son around while I wait in line with my stepkids.  \n\nHowever when my wife or one of my sister's can't come with us I just take my son.  My wife has also taken just her kids when my son doesn't want to go.  We have also taken just my stepkids and left my son with my sisters when he didn't feel like going out in public.\n\nThis last weekend I had time to go to the park and my son asked.  I asked my wife but she didn't want to go.  I checked with my sisters but they were busy. So I took my son without my stepkids.  \n\nWhen we got home my in-laws were there fighting with my wife.  The kids had called them and said I was excluding them from going to Disneyland.  The thing is they never volunteer to watch the kids when we go.  They hate the crowds and the lines.  \n\nThey said that I'm treating their grandchildren like they are less important than my son.  My wife who was dealing with a migraine was almost in tears.  \n\nI helped my son get cleaned up and put him to bed.  Then I came back and tore a strip off of them.  I said that their grandkids are children and do not understand yet why they cannot always get their way, but that they are adults and presumably are able to understand why I couldn't take the three kids by myself.  I couldn't leave my son and my stepkids are too young to wander the park by themselves.  I volunteered to take them next time so THEY could watch their grandchildren while I took care of my son. Or they could watch my son and I would wait in line with the kids.  \n\nThey said they didn't want to do that but still said I was being an asshole not taking their grandchildren. \n\nSo I presented another option.  They could pay for a helper to come with us for the day.  That way if my wife can't come I can still take the kids.  I did ask that they also pay for the days I could not go so my wife could take all three kids.  \n\nThey said that I was being ridiculous.  So I told them unless they were willing to help they could stay the fuck out of how we did things in our family.  \n\nI went and talked to the kids and told them that I understood why they called their grandparents but that they had to learn that sometimes they would have to not go to stuff until they were old enough to be safe by themselves.   I made sure they knew I wasn't mad at them and said that I would take them the next time I could schedule it.  \n\nMy wife said I was right in how I handled stuff but that her parents were mad at me for putting them in their place.", "created_utc": 1675285344, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10r62gu/aita_for_not_taking_my_stepkids_to_disneyland/", "score": 943, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You clearly have done all the options at various times (just son, just stepkids, all together) so it's not like you are always just taking your son and leaving them out. Plus this wasn't the typical once-or-twice-in-a-lifetime Disney trip. You obviously live nearby and so this is more just a regular outing.\n\nThe grandparents are assholes for interfering. As a grandparent myself, I cannot imagine doing things like this, which would only make it less likely that I would be a major part of my grandkids' lives. I'm really suspicious about why your kids called the grandparents anyway, as though they knew the grandparents would take their side.

Bonkers.", "I am so glad this ended in you and your wife agreeing and not your wife passive aggressively insulting you for a week.", "NTA... make your stance clear and stick to it, or it will always be a problem. They didnt offer any help, so the problem is theirs", "NTA. I think that it\u2019s good and healthy for you to have time by yourself with your son and for your wife by herself with her children. I get that it was because it wasn\u2019t safe for you to take all three together but really you don\u2019t need to justify it to anyone, apart from explaining to the other children why they can\u2019t go. \n\nYour in laws sound like a nightmare", "NTA.", "I\u2019m going with NTA bc you said you have passes and can go frequently if you want. Sometimes you\u2019ll all go together, sometimes not. That\u2019s ok!\n\nSeparately though, the Disneyland Accessibility Service doesn\u2019t limit you to only the parent and one kid. Your family including the NT kids can go together. Source: have two ASD kids and two NT kids; DAS is the greatest.", "NTA.  The whole thing kind of made me laugh because we have a special needs grandson so we can relate.  But my husband and I  would NEVER have questioned our son's decisions regarding his children.  AND we would have gone all over Disneyland at any time with one, two, or all three children.  I mean, that's just us.  It's too bad you don't apparently have that kind of in-law support.  \n\nAnd my two non special needs grandchildren, one older and one younger than their brother, thoroughly understand that sometimes their brother gets something they're not going to get to have.  That's just a truism of life.  We are not going to rent a wheelchair to push them all over Disneyland, for example.", "INFO: Is there a reason you couldn\u2019t take your son and your step kids and just let everyone know they have to do all of the same rides?\n\nAnd I ask that realizing there may be a totally legitimate reason, especially given that your son may require some additional attention or care. It\u2019s just not clear from your post.", "NTA there was no way to take all three and use disability accommodations.", "\u201cWe\u2019re angry you can\u2019t handle two young kids and a disabled kid by yourself! We don\u2019t want to offer to help, just to whinge about it!\u201d Seems like they missed the part where the step kids have gone without your son. Two young abled kids are hard enough to handle at Disneyland as it is! Good for you for holding your ground, and good for your wife for standing with you 100%. She sounds like a good one, and it sounds like the kids are being raised well, since they accepted the situation after you explained it. NTA at all.", "Is one of your kids disabled?", "So your step children were home when your son asked if you could go and you didn\u2019t take your step children? Did you think about telling your son \u201cwe can\u2019t go today because mom is sick and I can\u2019t safely watch everyone\u201d? Obviously not, though you could\u2019ve chosen an activity all 3 kids could\u2019ve done. Did you even explain to the others why they couldn\u2019t go? Or did you just walk out saying \u201chey, Johnny and I are going to Disney, see ya later!\u201d  Just from your post and The last couple of comments, it seems like YTA, if only because you\u2019re favoring your son over your stepchildren, and doing so blatantly in front of them", "Right", "The only reason I ever did an all-inclusive in Mexico is because the charge includes childcare and kids activities.   If that's an option, check into it.  It made vacations work for everyone", "I took one OR the other of my kids on trips, never both until they were teens. Sometimes one got to go to Disney, sometimes one got to go to Europe. If there was ever any dissent, I just told them it would all even out in the end.\n\nBetter to have a magical time with one and then a magical time with the other next year, than have a miserable time with both!", "Did you read the part that sometimes the stepkids have gone to Disney without the son? Everyone has had a chance to go, and will again."]}
