You kept poking until he responded in kind. He could very easily say what he did was a joke on you, but like him, you aren't laughing either. BTW just because you're known to be an \"irreverent comedian\", perhaps  not everyone appreciates your jokes like you think.", "The fact that you won\u2019t even say what the joke was says enough. \nYTA", "YTA\n\nIf your job has a morals clause, then maybe it's time for you to grow up and stop making jokes so inappropriate you can't even type them on reddit.", "Sorry YTA\n\nYou told a joke. He did not laugh and thought it was offensive.  He ask for an apology, you refused. He dropped contact. It was done.\n\nYou escalated. You went after his GF. What did you think was going to happen? Nothing, obviously. You were wrong.\n\nIf you are going to harass(deliberately antagonize) people, you should occasionally expect them to return the favor with interest. Leave the man and his gf alone.", "INFO : What did you text to the GF and why won't you tell us the joke? How can we judge if he is overreacting if we do not know what you said?", "YTA. It stops being a joke when the joke hurts someone - so it\u2019s not a joke anymore. The moment you could\u2019ve solved this and prevented it from going any further is when your friend asked you to apologize. That directly conveyed that you had upset him, and friends usually don\u2019t like upsetting other friends, so I don\u2019t get why you wouldn\u2019t just suck it up and apologize, even if you didn\u2019t mean it. Doing that would show you care about his feelings, and I guess he assumed you don\u2019t after that. If you don\u2019t owe him that consideration/respect, then he probably feels like he doesn\u2019t owe it to you either.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t going to suddenly stop being upset after you disregarded his feelings, so he retaliated. I don\u2019t know what the \u201cjoke\u201d was (is it so bad that you won\u2019t share it on here or something?), but if it was bad enough to feel worth sending to the dean and could get you kicked out of school or fired, I imagine it was rough. Even if it wasn\u2019t, this could\u2019ve been avoided by considering your friend\u2019s feelings and apologizing. Regardless of the content of the joke, all that matters now is that it hurt your friend. \n\nAlso, the fact that he shared proof of you messing around with other girls behind your girlfriend\u2019s back is your fault, not his - for doing it in the first place, and for upsetting the guy who was holding your secrets. About him telling your friend group what happened: they\u2019re his friends too, and he came to you first to work it out but you declined, so it makes sense for him to talk to them about it - I don\u2019t get why you\u2019d be mad about that. Anyway, the fact that you texted the girlfriend after the fact just makes it worse. Sounds like they all deserve an apology at this point. Just my opinion\n\nEdit: I saw your comment saying that Dan did this all because of a \u201cstupid joke,\u201d but that\u2019s not why - it\u2019s how poorly and callously you responded when he told you it upset him (and I imagine you texting his girlfriend added to the problem).", "I don't need to know and don't even care what the joke was. Your friend called you out on it and instead of apologising like a decent human being who accidentally oversteps a line, you doubled down. \n\nYou were so lucky to get another chance to apologise in the cold light of day, but you blew that too.\n\nDan decided he didn't need an AH like you in his life and removed himself from your group. Being a decent guy, he didn't want to just ghost his friends so he told them the reason. I can't imagine any of them were surprised.\n\nYou could have let be an end to it. But nooooo, you then start drunk texting his GF. She was adult enough not to respond.\n\nThen...shock, horror! Dan sent screenshots of your \"jokes\" to your place of work and now you may have to face the consequences of your actions.\n\nBe clear here, it's not the original joke or refusing to apologise at that time. It's not refusing to apologise even when sober and given a chance by Dan. It's for escalating the whole thing and upsetting his GF.\n\nYou knew your work has a morals clause and you chose to break it. Or were you relying on everyone you offended remaining silent and just putting up with your crap?\n\nYTA", "YTA - well if it isn\u2019t the consequences of my own actions.

If other people seeing the joke don\u2019t laugh and instead it leads to you being fired or your gf breaking up with you, you were being gross rather than funny.", "I sometimes think there's no way some of these are real. Maybe I'm overestimating humanity. You told a joke so inappropriate that you can't post it on here. Your friend told you, like an adult, that he was offended by the inappropriate joke and instead of just apologizing, like an adult, for offending your friend, you double downed. He rightly informed you that he didn't want to associate with you anymore. You could have left it there but instead decided to be petty and text his GF. To top it off, instead of owning that, you think being drunk is a valid justification. \n\nI say this with no malice, if this is real, YTA, and may need to seek help before your ego drives everyone away.", "I mean, I assume this isn't real but of course YTA for cheating and making inappropriate \"jokes.\"", "I love your entitlement, YTA", "YTA.

Not everything is funny and the simple fact that you couldn't apologize for whatever \"joke\" you made and got your arrogance in between speaks volumes about you as a person. \n\nMore than the joke, this is about what you texted his girlfriend. You deserved whatever he did after that.", "YTA - just because it's a \"simple f\\*\\*\\*ing joke\" to you doesn't mean it was a joke to them.
