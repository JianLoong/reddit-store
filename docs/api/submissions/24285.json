They asked not to share photos of the trip bc they KNOW they are exploiters - and hiding behind the rainbow flag. I (F) live in Central America with my Wife and I see how gringos use the justification of \"it's cheaper here\" to underpay the people that clean their house and help build their dream homes.", "NTA at all! Your brother is running off to a poor country with the goal exploiting a vulnerable woman for his own wants. Women aren\u2019t incubators and she\u2019s only consenting because she\u2019s truly desperate.\n\nIt\u2019s also disgusting that he\u2019s playing the homophobia card. Many gay people, myself included, have ethical issues with surrogacy that are totally unrelated to sexuality", "NTA. I'm a lesbian, this is not what causes rampant homophobia. This is exploitation plain and simple. Adopt a kid ffs. Holy shit.", "NTA. You did nothing wrong. And this IS heartbreaking. What are your brother and his partner going to tell this child about their mother when the child asks?? They will have to make up a fairy tale so that their own child doesn't hate them.", "NTA. This is the most disgusting post I have read on this site.", "I don't think advocating for people living in poverty is ever 'crossing a redline'. NTA.", "NTA. This reeks of exploitation. Yes, you betrayed a confidential situation but to your family because of your concern for the people involved. Your father's reaction re inheritance is extreme but that's up to him. He may reconsider or not, but that's not your problem.\n\n Clearly your brother is very upset. And what's all this \"stuff like this causes rampant homophobia\" coming from the partner? Are you not allowed to criticise their childbirth choices simply because they are gay? They don't get a free pass on actions that exploit others just because of their sexuality. It's a very sad situation and must have put you in a very difficult position.", "You 100% are NTA", "Your dad is right and good for him.  NTA.", "NTA, they asked you to lie and you were not obligated to do so, but respected them enough not to publicly post. But it IS exploitation. They chose her BECAUSE it's \"much cheaper.\" No different than Nike choosing child labor because it's \"much cheaper.\"", "NAH\nI\u2019m going against the grain here but Carla is being paid for the surrogacy, and it seems from what you described, she really needs it. \nThe conditions she lives in aren\u2019t your brothers fault. Or yours. \nCould your brother offer to pay for her to live somewhere nicer while pregnant? I mean, maybe. Surrogacy isn\u2019t cheap normally so maybe he can afford it but it\u2019s not his responsibility. \nYour dad is rightfully appalled by Carla\u2019s living conditions but how is that your brothers fault? Honestly, it just sounds like your dad is being low-key homophobic with the adoption line. Has he adopted? Has he been telling you to adopt and not have bio kids? \nIf anyone is the asshole it\u2019s your dad.", "Being gay does not absolve them of what is basically slavery and sexual exploration. It is disgusting and immoral. They should be warned against and held accountable. The 'homophobia' part is just their shame trying to justify itself, sickos", "You are NTA! Your brother and partner on the other hand are taking advantage of that lady precarious situation.Your dad is right adoption could had been a more compassionate option  but no your brother choosed an agency that uses third world country uterus as part of their profit business schema.   I see so many unethical things with this whole ordeal .", "NTA.\n\nwhat you\u2019ve described is\u2026 well, i don\u2019t want to write a post about it. \nbut you and your father are not wrong. \n\nif my sibling were considering what you\u2019ve described i might be reconsidering the relationship i have with them, there would not be room for them to feel like the wronged party.", "NTA.\n\nOk, so I get the stance of: Well she's going to be doing this surrogacy thing anyway, she  may as well do it for us.\n\nBut, the thing here is, they are flying to another country, to say they don't have to pay the surrogate what they'd pay her here. And the thing is, she likely wouldn't have access to the recourses or medical care that a US surrogate would have either.\n\nYou wanna treat her fairly, pay her what you'd pay a US surrogate, but of course your brother doesn't want to do that, in fact that's the whole reason they are doing this. They are taking advantage of this woman and underpaying her even though she is literally creating a life for them and letting them use her body to do so.\n\nSo if taking a stance against this makes you homophobic, than is homophobic really such a bad word. Because now, lately I see the words transphobic and homophobic used to excuse actions and out of context so much, that soon people are going to stop giving a damn and I am real close to doing so myself. Like people throw these words around so much without knowing what they actually mean because unlike the people who actually fought for these rights, fought against real homophobia, they haven't really experienced it.  \n\nSo the fact that your brother is calling you homophobic because of this, makes me think he hasn't experienced true discrimination against who he's attracted to either. \n\nSo yeah, definitely  not the asshole. Good on you for showing you parents, and even better on your dad for speaking up. If your brother decides to go through with this WITHOUT paying that woman the money she should get, then I hope your father really does take him out of the will.\n\n**SO NOT THE ASSHOLE!**", "I wonder how much the surrogate is actually getting paid for this... I'm guessing a small % of  the actual fee.", "NTA. BTW, it is just as exploitative if they weren't gay.", "NTA. Your brother IS exploiting this poor woman.", "NTA \n\nIf they were living in those conditions in the US, then CPS would be called. Not to mention, the health conditions that could possibly come with this child after the mother being pregnant in that environment are enough for concern. \n\nYour dad is absolutely right with what he said. This whole situation just makes me sad. They are taking advantage of this poor woman for a \u201ccheaper\u201d route.", "Your brother and his partner are exploiting this woman and they\u2019re angry that they\u2019ve been found out. It has nothing to do with being gay, I should imagine straight couples exploit these women in the same way. They only wanted privacy because they know what they are doing is wrong. \n\nGood for you for mentioning it to your dad. I\u2019m not surprised he\u2019s disgusted and ashamed of them. \n\nWhat are they going to do if this poor baby is born with health problems due to the mothers poor living conditions, will they refuse to take it? \n\nIt\u2019s people like your brother who perpetuate this type of \u2018pregnancy slavery\u2019 and it should be stopped\n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nSeems your brother only wanted \"privacy\" because he knew what he and his partner are doing is unethical. They're trying to cheap out at the expense of a clearly already struggling woman. Your dad is right, and you were justified in telling him. Why would your brother want you to keep her living conditions a secret from your father unless he knew what he was doing is wrong?\n\nEdit to add: This also has NOTHING to do with your brothers sexual orientation. This would be just as unethical for a straight couple to do. He's using his sexuality as a cop out for you exposing his shameful actions as a human.", "No definitely not the Ahole. Maybe u didn't think it through about showing pictures as I can see why yr dad would think yr brother is taking advantage of her. But yet not and Ahole in this situation", "ESH \n\nYour brother - Maybe he didn't know what he was getting into but then to take a family member as a translator and to expect them not to babble.. that's just plain stupid. Secondly, when he saw Carlas situation it didn't bother him enough to say/do something about it. Perhaps help her more etc. It is hard out there for queer people and the least we want is such things getting attached to the community. \n\nYou .. because you could have talked to your brother about this. Told him your concerns about Carla's welfare.. and maybe convince your brother to send her more help/money directly. Instead you chose to break the sibling bond and that of his  privacy. You did cross a line and you know it. Carla gets nothing out of this. Lose lose situation.\n\nYour dad - what does he expect will happen now because of his ultimatum? Your brother says no to the baby Carla is stuck with a white baby or has to abort it. There's a reason it seems your brother didn't tell him anything.\n\nSo let's recap the end result of your actions: dead baby (possibly), Carla gets no money, your brother is childless, you don't have a sibling anymore, ruined relationship  between your bro and dad. Bull's eye!", "Sounds like your brother can probably afford to over pay this woman. Can he double her pay? Can he help get her home situation better? Does he actually think a baby growing on rice, beans and a vitamin pill is going to be healthy? How does this dad feel about this if the woman was PROPERLY compensated? \n\nLook this woman is obviously desperate and she's going to rent her uterus out to somebody, so why don't you talk to your dad and brother and see if you guys can actually make a change in her life with this rental? You are NTA, and you all have a chance to actually change somebody's life! Please take it!\n\nEdited because talk to text did me dirty and swapped in a swear word lol", "NTA. Is cheaper really what he and his partner want when they are talking about the health of their fetus and surrogate? Apart from the multivitamin what else is being done to help this poor woman? Rice and beans and sleeping on the floor? I feel awful that this woman and her family have so few choices that this is what she can do to support her family, but it still feels massively exploitative. This has nothing to do with homophobia and everything to do with white men taking advantage of poor women.", "NTA. This is exploitation. It's disgusting how impoverished/foreign women have been dehumanised so much that far too many people consider this exploitation acceptable. \n\nYour brother is a misogynistic racist who views this woman as an object to produce a commodity for him. He doesn't see her as a human being. He has no empathy, no compassion, no respect. He shouldn't be allowed anywhere near a child.", "NTA. Surrogacy is often pretty exploitative in exactly this pattern", "You Said it so well \u201dThey don\u2019t get a free pass on actions that exploit others just because of their sexuality \u201d \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f \nSurrogacy is nothing more than a industry at this point.", "Very much agree!", "Exactly! I'm also kind of wondering what, if anything, OP's father and family can/will do to help Carla improve her family's situation now that they are aware of it and is there a way I can help?", "exactly!! I was coming to say the same.", "I'd like to help Carla too."]}
