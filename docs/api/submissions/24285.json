He may reconsider or not, but that's not your problem.\n\n Clearly your brother is very upset. And what's all this \"stuff like this causes rampant homophobia\" coming from the partner?

Surrogacy isn\u2019t cheap normally so maybe he can afford it but it\u2019s not his responsibility. \nYour dad is rightfully appalled by Carla\u2019s living conditions but how is that your brothers fault?

Has he been telling you to adopt and not have bio kids? \nIf anyone is the asshole it\u2019s your dad.", "Being gay does not absolve them of what is basically slavery and sexual exploration.

And the thing is, she likely wouldn't have access to the recourses or medical care that a US surrogate would have either.\n\nYou wanna treat her fairly, pay her what you'd pay a US surrogate, but of course your brother doesn't want to do that, in fact that's the whole reason they are doing this. They are taking advantage of this woman and underpaying her even though she is literally creating a life for them and letting them use her body to do so.\n\nSo if taking a stance against this makes you homophobic, than is homophobic really such a bad word. Because now, lately I see the words transphobic and homophobic used to excuse actions and out of context so much, that soon people are going to stop giving a damn and I am real close to doing so myself. Like people throw these words around so much without knowing what they actually mean because unlike the people who actually fought for these rights, fought against real homophobia, they haven't really experienced it.  \n\nSo the fact that your brother is calling you homophobic because of this, makes me think he hasn't experienced true discrimination against who he's attracted to either. \n\nSo yeah, definitely  not the asshole. Good on you for showing you parents, and even better on your dad for speaking up.

Perhaps help her more etc. It is hard out there for queer people and the least we want is such things getting attached to the community. \n\nYou .. because you could have talked to your brother about this. Told him your concerns about Carla's welfare.. and maybe convince your brother to send her more help/money directly. Instead you chose to break the sibling bond and that of his  privacy. You did cross a line and you know it. Carla was poor and remains poor because of you. Lose lose situation. If you were to walk through the possible outcomes for everyone involved, then sharing the photos with family would not have been the right move. Also, important to note that you have willfully excluded how much Carla was going to get from this (hopefully more than just the vitamins) and jumped straight into 'being offended' by the poverty. \ud83d\ude44 #dearrichpeople.\n OP if you read this, send Carla $50 every month if you feel so sad for her!\n\n\nYour dad - what does he expect will happen now because of his ultimatum? Your brother says no to the baby and poor Carla is stuck with a white baby or has to abort it. There's a reason it seems your brother didn't tell him anything. This surrogate\u2019s life conditions would not change, regardless of her brother\u2019s decision. If anything, this is an opportunity to support her family. Should they pay more, yeah, but I\u2019m not going to say surrogacy is wrong. Adoption isn\u2019t much cheaper and it is much more emotionally difficult because they often fall through (our friends have been trying to adopt for 3 years because they can\u2019t afford surrogacy) and several families have changed their mind after the babies were born. \n\n\nSo let's recap the end result of your white saviour actions: aborted foetus (possibly), Carla gets no money, your brother is childless, you don't have a sibling anymore, ruined relationship  between your bro and dad. Bull's eye! Sorry to say, but this completely reeks of 'white/rich saviour behaviour'. \n\nEdited to add: \n_All of us are guilty of \u2018exploitation\u2019 by association. Very few of us would be willing to give up the luxuries that can only exist off the exploitation of others._  This is not to say we shouldnt do anything about it.. we absolutely should.. we just dont get to judge others. \n\nAlso $10,000 for a surrogate is very less in the US but it is a lot of money for Carla from the shack. Give her that extra $$ or help in some way.", "Sounds like your brother can probably afford to over pay this woman. Can he double her pay? Can he help get her home situation better? Does he actually think a baby growing on rice, beans and a vitamin pill is going to be healthy? How does this dad feel about this if the woman was PROPERLY compensated? \n\nLook this woman is obviously desperate and she's going to rent her uterus out to somebody, so why don't you talk to your dad and brother and see if you guys can actually make a change in her life with this rental? You are NTA, and you all have a chance to actually change somebody's life! Please take it!\n\nEdited because talk to text did me dirty and swapped in a swear word lol", "NTA.

They are purposely choosing a place where the woman is not becoming a surrogate because of altruism but because of survival. You can\u2019t argue your way around that being exploitation. They aren\u2019t helping this woman they are putting her life and health at risk to save some money. Despicable.", "Colombia's maternal mortality rate is double that of the US (which has a significantly worse rate than other rich countries). So actually death is a much more likely outcome for Carla than it would be for a US based surrogate. Nobody is saying that all outsourcing is exploitative. They are saying outsourcing surrogacy often is. What medical risks is the doctor in the root canal taking for this? None. The medical tourist is taking the risk of going to an unknown doctor charging less. With surrogacy there is limited risk to the tourist and extensive risk to the surrogate.", "BPO outsourcing is not the same as surrogacy.\n\nAnd the surrogate relationship is not the same as the doctor patient relationship in medical tourism.\n\nThis woman is being exploited. The solution is certainly compex and not going to be solved on a reddit threadBut your outrage at white americans and using irrelevant examples definitely not informing that solution.", "Is the doctor in Mexico at risk of literal death by performing the root canal? If so, yes traveling to Mexico to do so is exploitative. Considering the maternal mortality rate in Columbia is almost 3x what it is in the US, OP\u2019s brother and BIL being okay with risking a woman\u2019s life so they can get a bargain basement rate baby is fucking disgusting.", "Paying a doctor to perform a service is not comparable to paying someone to have a baby.", "A womb is an organ. That\u2019s not a reach, that\u2019s accurately describing this situation.", "Thanks for presenting an unconventional perspective on this (from my US centric point of view). I agree that medical tourism is not always exploitation, maybe even not even often. And yet this feels creepy.", "You sound like the one looking for something to be offended by tbh.\n\n> They told me that its a lot cheaper than in the USA\n\nSecond sentence of the post. Her labor is being exploited based on where she lives. They should be paying her a fair amount.", "The cost of flights is pennies compared to the surrogacy. In the US with fees and an agency you\u2019re looking at spending at least $125,000 and can easily approach $175K. The cost in Columbia can be less than $70K.\n\nhttps://www.sensiblesurrogacy.com/surrogacy-costs/\n\n(But Carla wouldn\u2019t be getting anywhere close to that amount of money. She would only get a portion. The fees cover the agency fee, legal fees, medical cost, etc)", "I had a quick google. \nA Columbian surrogate ( all inclusive), costs around $60 000. \n\nAmerican surrogacy (all inclusive) costs $110 000 - $170 000. \n\nLet's say it costs $5 000 per trip for everyone to go visit her (quick google I picked the high end for flight costs and low-mid range for accommodation) . Even if they make multiple trips to visit her they still come out a long way in front $$$ wise.", "Exactly the point! OP suddenly cares about the one poverty-stricken women that was thrown in her face. Poor people existed before their flight to Colombia.. if they really wanted to cause a real change in the world, they would do something about it.", "From what OP described. It\u2019s more than likely that that\u2019s not the way her brother or their surrogate went. Having the resources for it didn\u2019t necessarily mean that\u2019s the route taken so my assumption is fine and still stands as is.", "Thanks I know that. What I meant is that there isnt enough info, whether that would be the expected outcome. Hence it is just an extrapolation/exaggeration", "Are you just arguing the ethics of surrogacy? \n\nMy very American ex-army friend in Raleigh, North Carolina, has been a surrogate twice already in the last 6 years. I can confirm to you that it is not out of altruism but for her to survive living in the US and pay for her kid's college. Maternal mortality rate in the US is 21 (compared to 10 in Romania and 7 in Bulgaria) so her risk of dying while doing something she is paid for is very real. Please help prevent this \"exploitation\" in the US first \ud83d\ude44\n\nAs a person from the third world, I would like to repeat: Please dont be offended by our poverty on our behalf. If it really bothers you so much do something about it. Send Carla $50 a month so her kids can do well.", "There is nothing about the risks and benefits in the post. Don't  you see that OP could have ensured Carla gets taken care of, but they chose to get offended? \ud83d\ude44\n\nOP hasnt indicated how much Carla was going to get paid so we can't know if it was fair. Frankly at this point just send Carla $50 a month if her poverty makes you feel so bad. \n\nMaternal mortality rate in US is 3x of Bulgaria and nearly 20\u00d7 of Norway. Does it mean everyone using an American surrogate is exploiting those women? \n\nThis US centric thinking is exactly the saviour behaviour I am talking about.", "Maternal mortality rate in the US is 3x of Bulgaria and 13x of Norway. By that definition, anyone that uses an American surrogate is exploiting them too?\n\nWe are not here to discuss ethics of surrogacy - you are welcome to have your own opinion on it. Op was wrong in sharing the photos because they felt offended by poverty \ud83d\ude44 My judgement of tgis is ESH. The brother and fatger are AH as well!", "This is all about whether Carla is getting paid enough or not. We are not here to discuss ethics of surrogacy itself. \n\nOP could have ensured Carla gets taken care of but they chose to get offended. \ud83d\ude44", "Thanks for saying that! And I do agree this isn't straightforward and nuance is very important.", "Are you actually saying you dont understand the differences in cost of living in different countries? \n\nLet's say you would pay $5,,000 for a root canal in the US. But you can go to Mexico and do it for $500. Are you exploiting the doctor who is happy to charge you 500?", "Any idea on how much Carla would get? Carla is clearly living in poverty and has 4 other dependents she needs to feed. Her situation seems desperate and she is going to get exploited whatever way she chooses to sustain her family.\n\nUnless the surrogacy money is enough to help improve her living conditions and, maybe, even help start her own small business. In that case I think the situation is more win-win (exploitative but necessary for Carla).\n\nSpoiler alert:\n\nIt is like the ending of Gone Baby Gone film. The current situation is logically wrong, but the alternative is much much worse for the people involved.", "From what OP described, the father called them White babies, and OP didn't correct his father in the post for calling them that. Your assumption only works if you also assume that OP is lying or misinformed.", "It\u2019s always a risk. People who as far as anyone can tell are completely healthy die from pregnancy, it happens.", "No one is offended by Carla\u2019s poverty. You keep making that claim to multiple people instead of actually reading their comments. It\u2019s the brother of the OP that is at fault here. And the justification that Carla lives in poverty with or without the brother exploiting her is terrible logic. Horrible unethical things happen every day, if I engage in them just because they would be happening anyways that doesn\u2019t make my actions ethical.", "If your friend is using surrogacy to survive in the US that\u2019s against the law. Surrogates can be paid but legally there are financial requirements. If she\u2019s becoming a surrogate to survive then yes, that\u2019s exploitation, and exploration happening in the US doesn\u2019t make it acceptable to happen in other countries. \n\nIn fact, that\u2019s makes the OP\u2019s brother\u2019s actions even MORE egregious because the financial cost of exploiting someone in his own country wasn\u2019t good enough for him, he wanted to do it for even cheaper and for someone even more likely to be forced to accept the lower price for survival. Again, there\u2019s no way to argue that his actions are ethical.", "What are the occupational hazards of preforming a root canal compared to those surrogacy?", "Given her actions. I\u2019d lean towards misinformed. If it was going thru a process such as an egg donor I don\u2019t believe the father would have such a reaction as it would perfectly fine and legal, just occurring in another country. OP didn\u2019t say either or so using your logic it would be wrong to assume either.", "All i am saying is that it is off topic. Information in the post doesn't indicate that Carla could have died or not. she did already survived birthing her own children. But surrogates can die in childbirth anywhere in the world.", "Well actually OP has stated how 'sad' they thought everything was in Colombia. That is what I am pointing out. If you are so sad about it, do something \ud83d\ude44 \n\nAs for the brother.. I 100% agree. He is an AH too. If you look for the most downvoted comment, I judged this as ESH with lots of explanations. The father sucks too.", "Agreed, I am not siding with the brother either. Everyone sucks here. \n\nIn my original comment,  I judged this as ESH. OP, the brother and the father all suck here.", "Lol you can ignore the point I am making with that analogy and stretch it far enough that it breaks.\n\nBut the point still remains and stares you in the face. I was responding to how buying something cheaper is not necessarily exploitating something.", "Yeah, and some countries have higher rates of maternal mortality than others. Similarly, some have better access to medical care should complications arise", "You are misunderstanding my point. I\u2019m not even referring to exploitation, regardless of my opinions of surrogacy. We\u2019re talking about value of the service and why a service may be more expensive regardless of \u201ccost of living\u201d."]}
