Yes, you betrayed a confidential situation but to your family because of your concern for the people involved. Your father's reaction re inheritance is extreme but that's up to him. He may reconsider or not, but that's not your problem.\n\n Clearly your brother is very upset. And what's all this \"stuff like this causes rampant homophobia\" coming from the partner? Are you not allowed to criticise their childbirth choices simply because they are gay? They don't get a free pass on actions that exploit others just because of their sexuality.

Surrogacy isn\u2019t cheap normally so maybe he can afford it but it\u2019s not his responsibility. \nYour dad is rightfully appalled by Carla\u2019s living conditions but how is that your brothers fault? Honestly, it just sounds like your dad is being low-key homophobic with the adoption line. Has he adopted? Has he been telling you to adopt and not have bio kids? \nIf anyone is the asshole it\u2019s your dad.", "Being gay does not absolve them of what is basically slavery and sexual exploration.

And the thing is, she likely wouldn't have access to the recourses or medical care that a US surrogate would have either.\n\nYou wanna treat her fairly, pay her what you'd pay a US surrogate, but of course your brother doesn't want to do that, in fact that's the whole reason they are doing this. They are taking advantage of this woman and underpaying her even though she is literally creating a life for them and letting them use her body to do so.\n\nSo if taking a stance against this makes you homophobic, than is homophobic really such a bad word. Because now, lately I see the words transphobic and homophobic used to excuse actions and out of context so much, that soon people are going to stop giving a damn and I am real close to doing so myself. Like people throw these words around so much without knowing what they actually mean because unlike the people who actually fought for these rights, fought against real homophobia, they haven't really experienced it.  \n\nSo the fact that your brother is calling you homophobic because of this, makes me think he hasn't experienced true discrimination against who he's attracted to either. \n\nSo yeah, definitely  not the asshole. Good on you for showing you parents, and even better on your dad for speaking up. If your brother decides to go through with this WITHOUT paying that woman the money she should get, then I hope your father really does take him out of the will.\n\n**SO NOT THE ASSHOLE!**", "I wonder how much the surrogate is actually getting paid for this...

Secondly, when he saw Carlas situation it didn't bother him enough to say/do something about it. Perhaps help her more etc. It is hard out there for queer people and the least we want is such things getting attached to the community. \n\nYou .. because you could have talked to your brother about this. Told him your concerns about Carla's welfare.. and maybe convince your brother to send her more help/money directly. Instead you chose to break the sibling bond and that of his  privacy. You did cross a line and you know it. Carla was poor and remains poor because of you. Lose lose situation. If you were to walk through the possible outcomes for everyone involved, then sharing the photos with family would not have been the right move. \n\n\nYour dad - what does he expect will happen now because of his ultimatum? Your brother says no to the baby and poor Carla is stuck with a white baby or has to abort it. There's a reason it seems your brother didn't tell him anything. This surrogate\u2019s life conditions would not change, regardless of her brother\u2019s decision. If anything, this is an opportunity to support her family. Should they pay more, yeah, but I\u2019m not going to say surrogacy is wrong. Adoption isn\u2019t much cheaper and it is much more emotionally difficult because they often fall through (our friends have been trying to adopt for 3 years because they can\u2019t afford surrogacy) and several families have changed their mind after the babies were born. \n\n\nSo let's recap the end result of your white saviour actions: aborted foetus (possibly), Carla gets no money, your brother is childless, you don't have a sibling anymore, ruined relationship  between your bro and dad. Bull's eye! Sorry to say, but this completely reeks of 'white/rich saviour behaviour'. \n\nEdited to add: \n_All of us are guilty of \u2018exploitation\u2019 by association. Very few of us would be willing to give up the luxuries that can only exist off the exploitation of others._  This is not to say we shouldnt do anything about it.. we absolutely should.. we just dont get to judge others. \n\nAlso $10,000 for a surrogate is very less in the US but it is a lot of money for Carla from the shack. Give her that extra $$ or help in some way.", "Sounds like your brother can probably afford to over pay this woman. Can he double her pay? Can he help get her home situation better? Does he actually think a baby growing on rice, beans and a vitamin pill is going to be healthy? How does this dad feel about this if the woman was PROPERLY compensated? \n\nLook this woman is obviously desperate and she's going to rent her uterus out to somebody, so why don't you talk to your dad and brother and see if you guys can actually make a change in her life with this rental? You are NTA, and you all have a chance to actually change somebody's life! Please take it!\n\nEdited because talk to text did me dirty and swapped in a swear word lol", "NTA. Is cheaper really what he and his partner want when they are talking about the health of their fetus and surrogate? Apart from the multivitamin what else is being done to help this poor woman?

I just think this particular instance seems suspect asf.", "This and the one from the other day where a infertile lady took in a pregnant teen from the foster system under the impression of an open adoption just to kick her out after birth. \n\nWomen\u2019s uterus are worth a lot of money apparently. \n\nThis is disgusting behavior.", "This NTA", "Not to get into it, but an aborted fetus is not a \"dead baby\" and its disengenuous to say it is.", "Sounds like Carla isn't pregnant yet...", "I also agree. I\u2019m not sure this woman would really be thankful when OP\u2019s brother tells her they\u2019ve decided she\u2019s too poor and uninformed to carry their baby because it would be exploitive\u2014 so she and her kids can just carry on in abject poverty. \n\nFew things in this world are black and white. OP\u2019s brother can and should do more for this woman and it\u2019s prob a better conversation to be having than the one they are.", "I am 100% not looking down on Carla.  She wants to be a surrogate to procide for her family? Great! She can and should. I am 100% looking down on the couple exploiting her.  They could pay half what it would cost in the US and still be paying a non exploiting wage.", "The fact that Carla really needs that money is why OP's brother can exploit her by paying far less than that service is worth - far less than he would pay in the USA, as stated in the original post. \n\nLike you say, they SHOULD pay more and support her family. They SHOULD pay enough that she can eat more than just rice and fucking beans while she is literally being a human incubator for them. But they're not going to, because they visited and saw her living in abhorrent conditions and were totally fine with it. That's exploitative and morally bankrupt, and allows white people to continue to take advantage of people in shitty situations who have no other options.", "It is *not* white/rich savior behavior to say that someone should not travel to another country to get a \u201cdeal\u201d on surrogacy. Carla does genuinely need money, and the fact that she needs the money so badly is why it\u2019s exploiting her to give her money to risk her health and her life. Her life conditions can absolutely be changed by the brother\u2019s decision, his decision to exploit her can kill her.", "By your logic we should allow commercial organ harvesting. Some things are not commercially available for solid ethical reasons.", "Not to be pedantic, but beans and rice are actually very healthy foods when eaten together.  Beans are very protein rich and when combined with rice provide all the essential amino acids that a person needs.  Now, this poor woman also needs other foods like fruits and vegetables to provide vitamins and certain trace minerals. Also, as you said, fats are essential.  But beans and rice are a protein rich food combo that is healthy, inexpensive, and can be made quite tasty with just a few spices.  I agree that Carla's situation is heart rending.  OP's brother and partner should be doing more to help this woman and her family have a better quality of life if they want her to have their child for them.", "Oh I agree. I did not make the distinction between SM and family in my post. I wonder, if he'd been proud of what he was doing, would he have put it on social media? Did he want it kept off SM because he thought he'd get pushback ( rather than, say, keeping it private out of delicacy for for mother and child)?", "Glad 8m not the only finding this fishy.", "Why wouldn't you go beforehand? Flights are cheap compared to the risk of being scammed, insisting on meeting her and inspecting her living conditions seem like reasonable steps in such long term expensive investment .", "Link to that post?", "Whoops.. totally agreed.. fixed it!", "Hmm, perhaps, even so, this poster just costed her a lot of money...and frankly this completely reeks of 'white/rich saviour behaviour'. \n\nThis surrogate\u2019s life conditions would not change, regardless of her brother\u2019s decision. If anything, this is an opportunity to support her family. Should they pay more, yeah, but I\u2019m not going to say surrogacy is wrong. Adoption isn\u2019t much cheaper and it is much more emotionally difficult because they often fall through (our friends have been trying to adopt for 3 years because they can\u2019t afford surrogacy) and several families have changed their mind after the babies were born.", "Not to mention the whole \u201cinfantilising of an adult woman\u201d, capable of making her own decisions based on her life circumstances, experiences and hopes. People and their bs \u201csaviour complex\u201d, obviously, know better. \n\nI\u2019m certain she\u2019ll be just sooo grateful when she might have to turn to sex work to feed her kids. Totally thankful those pesky gays didn\u2019t pay her to \u201crent\u201d her uterus. \n\nAnd I\u2019m not saying there\u2019s anything wrong with choosing to be a sex worker but being forced to because you have no choice? Not to mention the potential exploitation and danger. But at least, she hasn\u2019t been exploited because she\u2019s too uninformed.", "That's  the thing though.. OP has not indicated what Carla would have been paid (hopefully it wouldn'tjust be the vitamins). They just straight went to judgement and into 'being offended' by the poverty. \ud83d\ude44 #dearrichpeople", "Well, the conditions/outcomes created by OP are also not leading to an outcome where Carla IS getting paid more. So tell me, how did she help Carla?  I think they just need get off that saviour high horse.\n\nOP could have discussed their concerns with brother but they went nuclear because _they_ were shocked, not because they thought through all the outcomes. _Oh please nothing should impact the delicate sensitivity of rich Americans_\n\nThis is perhaps not a great example but it fits: The outsourcing industry absolutely did change the life of millions of Indians. Not eveyone was 'exploited'. For some of them, it was literally a way to pull their families out of poverty. \n\nThere is no clue in the post that whether or not Carla was being exploited or if it was a away for her to provide for her kids. Seems OP forgot to ask Carla that?\n\nLeaving this here so you can see the perspective:\n\n_In one of my fav books, Shantaram... a white Australian guys goes to Mumbai and stays in a cheap hotel. Hot water needs to be carried up to his room 3 flights up.\n\nHe sees the 'plight' of the person carrying the water and asks the manager to stop it. Manager stops to make this Aussie guy happy.\n\nLater he finds the water carrier guy standing outside the hotel looking sad. He asks what happened and he tells him he is suddenly out of a job. \n\nThe Australian guy goes back inside and demands that water should be carried up to his room 3 times a day \ud83d\udc40_\n\nYou can disagree with my third world country perspective, but ultimately, the question is whether OP is TA for sharing photos or not. And the answer is yes because their actions didn't lead to a good outcome for anyone, including Carla for whom they seem to have so much concern for. OP has willfully excluded how much Carla was going to get from this (hopefully more than just the vitamins) and jumped straight into 'being offended' by the poverty. \ud83d\ude44 #dearwhitepeople\n\nOP if you read this, send Carla $50 every month if you feel so sad for her!", "You are just extrapolating the latter half about killing so will ignore that.\n\nLike I said in my other replies, medical tourism and outsourcing are real world use cases where rich people pay less to get same services elsewhere.\n\nCan outsourcing be exploitation? Yes.\nBUT is all outsourcing exploitation? HARD NO. I have seen it first hand helping people out of poverty in my country.\n\nLet's say you would pay $5,,000 for a root canal in the US. But you can go to Mexico and do it for $500. Are you exploiting the doctor who is happy to charge you 500?\n\nNothing stopped OP from discussing it with their brother and paying Carla reasonable money. \n\nBut OP has willfully excluded how much Carla was going to get from this (hopefully more than just the vitamins) and jumped straight into 'being offended' by the poverty. \ud83d\ude44 #dearrichpeople", "Well no you are pushing it. \n\nBut consider this:Medical tourism and outsourcing are real world use cases where rich people pay less to get same services elsewhere.\n\nCan outsourcing be exploitation?
