They told me they don\u2019t want to see me settling for my \u201c2nd choice\u201d simply because I can\u2019t afford my first choice. On the other hand, my soon-to-be-MIL (let\u2019s call her J) is trying to \u201ctake charge\u201d of everything. (D is her eldest among her 2 sons.) Before, J keeps on saying marriage is just a piece of paper and we should get married when we can afford it but when she found out my parents gave us money for the wedding, she keeps on asking how much it is and she will double it. We declined because knowing her, we\u2019ll hear about it the rest of our lives and also, we have enough money to spend. \n\nI have a big family, so does D. J has a close friend who is so horrible, D is friends with her son but he can\u2019t stand her either. She spread horrible stories about me when I started dating D (she almost ruined us) among other things. I told D I won\u2019t invite her to our wedding. He agreed. Then we found out J invited her. When we confronted her, she told us it\u2019s her right and that she\u2019ll be paying the most anyway (again, we didn\u2019t accept her offer to give double what my parents gave). I cried a lot but decided to let it go. She\u2019s also telling us what flowers and motif and theme to have which we respectfully said no since D told her he\u2019s letting me choose what I want.  \n\nWe asked J if she wants to come with us for our gowns but she said she\u2019ll just buy a ready made dress from a famous designer. I\u2019m very close to my Mom. My Mom always asks for my opinion about her clothes, shoes, etc. so I choose some dress designs and when she approved them, had them custom made. We had our final fitting today and she looks so beautiful I almost cry. J came with us to see D\u2019s suit. When she saw my Mom\u2019s dress, she told my Mom that it\u2019s inappropriate and that she\u2019s trying to \u201cupstage\u201d the bride and that it\u2019s not a fashion show and she should have the decency to choose the proper dress blabla. I was half way into fitting my reception gown but I can\u2019t control my anger so I went out and lashed at her. I told her it\u2019s not our fault she didn\u2019t get a customized dress when we asked her to and we even offered to pay for it and my Mom isn\u2019t upstaging me because I choose that dress for her and it\u2019s a simple yet elegant dress so it\u2019s proper and it\u2019s not my Mom\u2019s fault that she\u2019s an insecure b**** and that if she say another word to my Mom she\u2019ll be uninvited. J turned to D but D said he agreed with me and that she\u2019s being too much.

Overall it sounds like she\u2019s potentially a narcissist.\n\nYou and your husband need to stop giving her power over your wedding however. You both need to start setting very clear, firm boundaries now, and stop involving her in situations you know she will misbehave in.

Everything else you said in the boutique was harsh and perfectly justified, but you did cross a line.  The personal insult diminished all the valid points you made, so now that is all she will remember of the argument.  Rather than learning from her mistake she will just feel attacked.

I told my fianc\u00e9 that was the end of my patience and that we were locking down all planning information. She was on a total info diet. We told her nothing except we would give her two weeks notice of the event. We\u2019ve been married for almost 5 years now, and She has given me no problems since.

Marriage is a team sport and I\u2019m not going to sign on and marry a bad team, that just sets you up for a lot of bad plays in the long run. \n\nYou\u2019re right your fianc\u00e9 should be handling her, but you should be involved in deciding what handling her MEANS.

As for her inviting her friend when we specifically said no, we went to their house to confront her and told her I don\u2019t want to ruin my mood on my wedding day and I want to be surrounded by people who loves us and not people who will just attend to have something to gossip.
