That's not a conversation, and anyone who thinks it is should consider how others receive them or view them when they \"converse\" with others.", "At what point was OP allow to say enough is enough. She took MIL bull crap long enough. I would have had enough when she started inviting inappropriate guess to my wedding. Can you imagine how bad MIL could get if OP has children? Time to set clear boundaries and rules going forward.", "NTA and also I\u2019m really glad that your husband to be stood up for you too you picked a good partner and I hope your wedding is beautiful!!!", "NTA. You may want to check out Just no mother in law sub justnomil. I am glad to see your fiance has s shiny spine to stand up for you. Your MIL will be waiting to see what you and your fiance do since she made a scene. Do nothing. So not acknowledge. If she sends in the crew to defend her just say she turned down the custom dress she doesn't get to cry about it now.", "NTA. maybe could have been a bit more diplomatic than calling her a bitch, but otherwise you seem to be in the right.", "NTA. You've made all the right choices, and your husband clearly rules. My only note would be that J's friend absolutely should not come, and letting J have that was her first foothold of control. Don't let her have any more.", "NTA, and you should have made your stand earlier.\n\nSet your boundaries and protect that border with a crapton of artillery.", "NTA put your foot down, stop acting like a doormat and letting your MIL walk alllll over you. \nUninvite J and tell your partner  to pull his finger out and tell his mother to back off.", "Nta. You have a great guy in D. He is not tolerating his mothers crap ehich is great. I would tell mil she isnt in charge of the wedding. I would also just not let her contribute any money into the wedding. Not even a penny. Otherwise she is going to think she has a right to dictate how it goes. Make sure every vendor and person involved in the wedding knows about mil so she camt do anything to sabotage your wedding. Then i would go ahead and tell mil that her friend isnt coming no matter what. Maybe get security for the wedding.", "NTA.\n\nJust uninvite your MIL and her friend. You really do not need these 2 to ruin your wedding.", "NTA...glorious DH hubby's shiny spine is already activated! Uninvite that troll friend and tell JUST NO MIL, she gets to show up, smile and go home, or she can keep her hindparts home. I would just stop telling her any plans, and make the venue verify guest names", "Oh this needs up voted more. Here is my fake  Reddit gold \ud83e\udd47", "I'm one of those people that will let you shit on me more than I should but you disrespect someone I love? You're get told off, pal.", "Completely get your confusion, this subreddit is such an ARE.", "But who cares if it's been edited?", "It\u2019s basically for accountability purposes, since sometimes folks get into disagreements and edit their original comments to make it look like they said something different originally.", "NTA and the fact your fiance is on your side shows he knows what a B\\*\\*\\*\\* his mother is. Uninvite her and also make sure that sorry friend of hers is uninvited also. You can have some people check at the doors to make sure who comes in or tries to show up. She is the one who ruined her relationship with her son.", "NTA and I suggest you talk with your fiance and tell him you are worried she might do something during the wedding and have her police or better uninvited with security informed not to let her in .", "NTA. MIL's like that, you need to draw a hard and fast line about what is and isn't acceptable. She doesn't like it, that's her problem. Stay firm, and put her in her place when she gets overbearing. Good job standing up for yourself, good on your man for backing you.", "NTA... And i suspect this is just the beginning, brace yourselves for a life of this unless you go nuclear no contact.", "NTA. Your husband is delightfully right. I would uninvite her too.", "NTA. Your mil is awful", "NTA", "This this this \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\udc4f uninvite J\u2019s friend immediately\u2026. You don\u2019t need that kind of toxicity at your wedding. Your MIL has enough venom for the entire venue, you don\u2019t need that doubled\u2026", "Is mom not a grown ass woman?", "Absolutely, great suggestion. I read an amazing wedding cake story on here at some point, and having the password definitely saved the couple from a lot of MIL hijinks.", "The next time she tries the \u201cI\u2019m the mother of the groom\u201d BS, tell her that that means the groom outranks her and his decision trumps hers. She has ZERO right to invite anyone, especially if you aren\u2019t taking any money from her (and I 100% recommend not taking any too, since she obviously will use it to buy her way). \n\nI\u2019d straight up tell her that since she had no problem embarrassing your mom in public, she shouldn\u2019t mind embarrassing herself by telling her friend she isn\u2019t invited. I\u2019d also notch it up by saying the friend isn\u2019t invited, so unless MIL lets her know, she won\u2019t have a seat, a meal, and that you\u2019ll be hiring security to escort her out (even if you aren\u2019t planning on actually hiring security). \n\nI have a MIL who sounds a lot like yours, and I hate confrontation and always try to just let stuff go too, but with people like that, you have to lay down the law and stick to it. Don\u2019t give in on anything else and make sure she knows you\u2019re done with her antics.", "OK, I give: ARE?", "Husband agreed with OP and told MIL she was wrong, so you are technically right while trying to be wrong.", "Acronym Rich Environment \ud83d\ude05", "A win is a win", "Of course it is....", "Probably not, but you are now", "NTA especially since D backed you", "NTA\n\nIt is good that you feel bad about the insecure b comment though. It's the one bit that went a wee bit too far.\n\nI chose that dress for her, and it is perfect. Do not disrespect my mother, now or ever. If you cannot abide by that, you do not need to attend the wedding. And you don't invite people, we do. You friend will not be welcomed.\n\nSee? Works fine without the insecurity barb thrown in. Sometimes it takes practice letting you outrage fly without letting every thought escape your brain, so don't be too harsh on yourself. You'll handle the evil MiL better next time.", "NTA\nAnd you should not be force to invite anyone who you do not want. Uninvited J's friend instantly. The disrespect  from her side is astonishing", "Stop allowing your MIL to manipulate you and set clear boundaries with her. Being nice to her is one thing, allowing her to walk all over you is another.", "Nta", "NTA This woman will be in your life for a long time. You need to set some firm boundaries because it sounds like she has no intention of backing off.", "NTA. Honestly don\u2019t really talk about wedding stuff around her. \u201cIt\u2019s good, we\u2019re busy planning!\u201d is all you need. \n\nCancel the invite for J\u2019s friend. Tell your MIL that you\u2019ve got everything handled. This scenario made me elope and add on the video package so people could watch via live stream.", "NTA - go to vegas and marry there", "NTA - okay maybe not the best choice of words BUT: the statement and sentiment could not be misinterpreted. \n\nSometimes the best defense is a good offense. \n\nI suspect OP didn\u2019t understand how FMIL was creeping on boundaries until FMIL went after OP\u2019s mom.", "Boundaries setting op, is extremely important  the sooner the better.  Nta", "And inform j that if she overstep the boundaries again (weather by inviting  people  or trying  to change stuff to the wedding you decided on) SHE is uninvited  to  the wedding .", "To be honest, my mum is grown ass woman, but she came from a different kind of family dynamic (her mother was most unpleasant and made her life hell)  and isn't as strong emotionally as I am.  She has also been dominated by my father for decades.  I could fully see that if someone came for her, she may not be able to stand up for herself.  I'd give her a chance, but if she couldn't defend herself, I'd be right in there.\n\nI used to be very non-confrontational, and still am in a lot of ways, but I had an incident once where someone had a go at my four year old daughter, and I tried to keep the peace and smooth everything over.  I suffered agonies of guilt for the next couple of years because I didn't defend my daughter (even though she knew nothing about the situation).  Next time something came up, I didn't hold back and it felt so much better.\n\nSo should a situation like that arise again, I know I'll be able to handle it.", "Let her know  she needs to uninvite  the person (s) she invited  despite your no or she and the person  are uninvited.  You need to set boundaries  NOW  .also as some already suggested  put passwords  on the wedding items and tell her clearly  it's  YOUR(+FIANCE) wedding  and the only ones  deciding anything  are the both of you ,no one else.  She needs to RESPECT YOU 2", "I always heard the mother of the groom is supposed to wear beige and shut up.", "NTA.     \n\n\nAlso: elope!!", "Ok ...have not even read this story completely because i just could not. Here is my thought: stop this...right now. Stop having J around and making decisions. Your emotions are all over your words, we can read her influence is shaking you up. You two (husband and wife) have to tackle this together and push J out. J has to uninvite the friend. Why on earth are you 2 so submissie towards J. Speak up!", "NTA I wouldn\u2019t accept the money for the wedding from her. She\u2019s already doing as she pleases and having her help financially will only make her feel more entitled. You should definitely assign someone to kick out that friend if she shows up and too keep and eye on your MIL Incase she acts up and needs to be kicked out.", "NTA. I\u2019ve never had anything this bad but my MIL almost ended my relationship as well. I\u2019d just stay the course with what you want and keep reminding her it\u2019s not her wedding.", "NTA - and good for D for standing up for you.  You might want to consider, just consider a sort of apology.  Apologize for losing your temper and calling her names.  But calmly explain that you do not apologize for your feelings on the situation.  Only for your delivery.  Sometimes it is worth mending fences.  Maybe see what D's opinion is.", "NTA.  J is clearly trying to upstage your family and make it about her.  I'd go a step further and revoke her friend's invite.", "NTA. Yes, your words were very blunt, but it sounds like you were appropriately direct with a boundary-overstepping and very rude future MIL. Don't worry that she cried. She was probably very embarrassed. She'll get over it, and hopefully behave better in future.\n\nIt's very promising that D was in your corner in this."]}
