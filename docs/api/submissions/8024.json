I will say staying in a Wal-Mart parking lot is safer than a truck stop or rest area overnight, there are also numerous campgrounds for RV's specifically that are quite safe. This type of vacation actually takes planning on a whole different level than what your husband is envisioning. There is also limited storage space so it will not be a one and done shopping trip for food either.

This wasn\u2019t a gift for you. At no point when he picked this gift did he have you or your children in mind. It was simply a gift for him. It\u2019s that simple. This comment alone has red flags in each sentence. I\u2019ve read some of your others as well. I\u2019m sure I can safely speak for quite a few people here when I tell you that you should leave me. He is NOT the one sis. You deserve better. \n\nWhat is he even there for? He doesn\u2019t do any child care or rearing tasks, he doesn\u2019t help pay any bills AND you speak on his temper and how when he gets upset it\u2019s not a good thing for anyone. That\u2019s NOT okay. Seems he\u2019s about as useful as those old wash rags some of us keep around to use for dusting or messy clean ups. Sure they are handy to have for a single moment but then you just toss them out because they were already yuck.", ">He would never ask to take the kids alone. And I am okay with that for sure.\n\njust... ma'am. no.", "Yeah, it's true that kids change things and incompatibilities that weren't known or present before come out.\nReal talk and maybe TMI:  my now co-parent and friend used to be my husband.  Having our son may have magnified growing issues that led to our (amicable) divorce.  We do well as we are now.  Good luck to you all in any and every case!", "NTA, of course, and I hope I'm not overreaching, but this is the kind of thing my less professionally successful ex-husband would do to sabotage my life in both career and parenting.  If your husband is too lazy to think through every possible step and misstep of traveling in an RV around an unfamiliar state, and how much work it is to be in an RV on the daily, then he's really not a good human, especially after reading comments and seeing that you both generate the household's main income AND do most of the childcare.  \n\nLet's start with this short checklist -- by far not the whole of traveling in an RV:   You have to plan ahead to know you'll have time and a location to dump black waste, another one for grey waste, keeping plenty of fresh and clean water on board, keeping enough propane safely stowed on board, (and having two backup plans in the likely event that your chosen location is closed or has broken down the day you need it -- not just one, but TWO backup plans for every single day) and tying/locking down EVERY possible flying object in the vehicle every single time he wants to drive it.  \n\nMaybe get him to make a timeline and detailed map for all those tasks, and add shopping, cost of gas in these gas guzzlers, and so much more.  What will he do if the rented RV's black water system malfunctions and you're living with the smell of, to be polite about it, excreta.  Where will he find parking for an RV near a beach?  They cost a ton per night in season in Florida, and Walmart without a water or electric hookup doesn't get the job done if you've got sand and sunscreen to deal with.  How will he secure wireless or sufficient data for internet usage?  \n\nHe is such an AH.  Why is he allowed to muck up your life like this?  Is he worth it?\n\n(edited because something went funky in the upload and I had to correct a lot of it)", "This is for sure part of his personality. He hates when I ask questions and always tells me to figure it out. I don\u2019t even ask a ton - I\u2019m a top level executive. Well educated and spoken ( most of the time :) ).", "This was my very first question to him! After researching some do within the dinette areas and such.", "Book a room for yourself and he can pick you up after his week in the RV with the kids.", "After using the plane tickets! One hop, and a ride to the resort. I\u2019m with you.", "I feel like Homer Simpson was kinder and more respectful.", "I immediately thought of the [bowling ball](https://youtu.be/NqrFpoxWqfU)!!!\n\nEdit: NTA", "I literally just said to my sister \u2026. But I guess I thought everyone was mistreated in a sense. Like you are supposed to take some of it\u2026. I just thought it was this way. We went to counseling, he\u2019s also in his own counseling, etc. Its been years with no changes.  I thought this was just the for better or worse part.  So eye opening.", "I hear you. Unfortunately, when I finally realized this ( and more) we were 2 kids, a house and a career deep. So I went to therapy and am working on it. Highly educated and a successful career doesn\u2019t mean you can easily break generations upon generations deep of abusive behavior and relationships easily. But I\u2019m working on it and my own behavior and responses. While also trying to keep things well enough that my children don\u2019t fall into the same situation I am in.", "I feel like if we were more educated in RVs I\u2019d be in. But we aren\u2019t and with small kids, not the time for an extended trip with no planning.", "Thank you for the info. I found that RVs had child safe spaces but they are different in each RV. I literally brought that up. This is him, he really doesn\u2019t care so much about the us aspect as much as the him aspect. Usually it doesn\u2019t get in the way of our life, but I the safety risk is getting me this time around.", "I feel this. And I hear you.", "See, I know nothing of your explanation of what\u2019s needed for the RV. And I know he has thoughts he doesn\u2019t follow through on so I would need to figure out. \n\nHonestly, I think I\u2019m doing a separate vacation.", "This isn't an issue of personality, this is emotionally manipulating you into thinking that 1. You're not asking perfectly reasonable questions, 2. He shouldn't be held accountable to give answers, and 3. He shouldn't be expected to change his life now that he has children.\n\nAfter your reply, I think the gift you give yourself is consulting with a marriage counselor or divorce attorney.", "You need to find out why you put up with this kind of behavior. It isn't going to improve over time.", "you should go \u201cfigure it out\u201d at a fancy resort by yourself!", "This is the answer. If he\u2019s so set on an RV holiday, fly with him to Florida, take him and the kids to the RV place, kiss them all bye-bye, and head off to your hotel on the beach. It\u2019s a win-win: everyone gets the holiday that fits their narrative.  I give him 36 hours.", "Then why are you married to him, and why have you had two children with him? What do you get out of this relationship?", "\"For better or worse\" applies to outside circumstances that can rattle a marriage (job loss, trouble conceiving, difficult in-laws, etc.), it DOESN'T apply to half the partnership operating as if they are NOT part of a partnership. \n\n\"Worse\" doesn't mean \"I accept my spouse's selfish behavior, lack of help, and lack of contributing to the care & funding of the household.\" \n\nAlso, \"in sickness and in health\" also doesn't mean \"my partner's AH personality is like a mental disorder I have to put up with for the rest of my life.\" You are being used and misused, and THAT mistreatment is not and should not be a part of every relationship.", "So he\u2019s not contributing emotionally or financially to your relationship, not a caregiver to your children, and not willing to work through any issues in therapy?? What is he bringing to the table? Sounds like nothing except emotional abuse\u2026 He\u2019s holding you back babe. \n\nI read an article recently that said single moms have more free time than married moms bc they don\u2019t have an adult man to take care of in addition to their children. Something you might want to think about.", "It sounds like he contributes nothing, financially or emotionally, to your family. Sure, it's not that uncommon, but it's also wrong. Do you feel that he loves you, or is it just that you provide him with everything? Do you love him? Please don't settle for the 'worse', honestly it sounds like you'd do much better without this dead weight.", "No, it's not supposed to be like this. He's just a shit husband and you don't have to put up with it.", ">But I guess I thought everyone was mistreated in a sense\n\nNo.\n\n>Like you are supposed to take some of it\u2026.\n\nNo.\n\n>I just thought it was this way.\n\nAnd no. \n\nI don't know anything about you other than what you posted.  But I absolutely know you deserve better than what you are getting in this relationship.", "No, honey. For better or worse means \"ill put up with you singing loudly in the shower or forgetting to close the cabinets. Ill put up with you driving around on empty in your own car because you forget to get gas, or that you refuse to wear matching socks\".\n\nIt is not \"ill allow myself to be made small, because you have to have the final say\". It isn't when he \"forgets\" to do the dishes after you asked him 3 times because he was too busy doing something else, or nagging him to feed the baby so you can put the toddler to bed. It is NOT him doing what he wants and telling you to take it or leave it for a family vacation. That is the slow death of a marriage by his choice to not be a partner. Don't let him kill your self esteem and joy for life along with this dying marriage.", "You. Deserve. Better.", "No this is not how it is. I\u2019m so sorry.", "Would you want your kids in a marriage like yours? Children learn what they live.", "Oh I agree with that, these trips take planning. You can't run the batteries down to much or nothing will work. Many times you can't run the microwave when the ac or heater is on. Don't get me wrong, mine has all the bells and whistles from a larger bathtub, washer and dryer and a dishwasher. But you still have to plan out driving time, where to stay, where to dump, what food to get or pre prepare. When not plugged into electric water and sewer you have to be careful to not over use what you have on board before you can get more. But I have been doing this for decades so it has become second nature.", "If he only cares about himself and not you or your kids, this trip is the least of your worries. Listen to what he\u2019s telling you: It\u2019s more important to him that YOUR Christmas present is for him than what you want. He doesn\u2019t care about the safety of your kids. \n\nActions speak louder than words and he\u2019s been showing you where you stand for a while now. That would be a deal-breaker for me. \n\nYou mentioned he\u2019s done this in the past pre-kids but you went along with it. Now it\u2019s time for him to grow up and it doesn\u2019t seem like he\u2019s capable of doing so. Things are only going to get worse. He\u2019s shown you who he is and it\u2019s alright if that\u2019s no longer good enough for you. You deserve a partner who doesn\u2019t consider his family an afterthought.", "I'm afraid those risks are only going to get harder to ignore as your kids get older.", "Honestly he sounds like a very selfish person.", "Tbh OP it doesn't sound like your husband co-parents at all. He needs to step tf up and stop being so selfish.", "I fully endorse this decision.  It doesn't sound as though he's got the necessary to plan and execute a successful family vacation in an RV.  Hint:  Florida is the worst state to be a novice at RV'ing.", "He won\u2019t make it half a day. The second he\u2019s dealing with a carsick baby or a poopy blowout in an RV, he\u2019ll be back in the hotel parking lot yelling at her, \u201cI\u2019m done babysitting your kids.\u201d", "In hindsight it wasn\u2019t much before kids.  But once all that responsibility he just lost it. \n\nThat being said he mainly stays in his man cave these days and I fully believe that study! When he stays away my days are so easy. Scheduled,  planned out, clean as I go and don\u2019t have to come back because all the kitchen cabinet doors are still open and there are food wrappers everywhere - it\u2019s so true.", "Hon. My sister has a mooch deadbeat husband who doesn\u2019t lift a finger unless directly asked. But you know what? He follows the schedule, treats her with respect, and plans vacations and outings (with her money) that he knows she will enjoy. They\u2019re doing a Florida trip too \u2014 with my sister\u2019s bestie. \n\nEven shitty husbands are better than your husband. Think about that."]}
