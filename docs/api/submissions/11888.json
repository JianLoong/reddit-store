With you.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. You rehomed them into your place, and you're giving them better care than a stranger might. She doesn't get a say after she gave up her rights to them.", "NTA dogs deserve stability in their lives too.", "NTA. She had her chance and she walked away from them. She's just being jealous and petty now. \n\nAnd if she really used the word disposition, then she's kinda dumb to boot, because it means what their temperament and personality is like, not where they go to live. Lol.", "You did rehome them. To your home.  \n\nNTA!", "NTA\n\nThere's a HIMYM episode about this", "NTA - she abandoned them.  Told you to rehome them.  You did with just you.", "Nta, tbh your ex just seem very jealous of the fact that she knows that she could have been her with you if it wasn't for the fact that she made an huge mistake, my guess is that she's also mad at the fact that you're happy, while she's miserable, my guess is that if she saw you unhappy with the dogs she wouldn't have said anything", "NTA - She dang did the dirty on you so who cares what she thinks....understandable to like them more than her, good for you", "NTA she suck", "This is the exact opposite of being the asshole.  She definitely is though.  You better keep a close eye on those pups bro, I wouldn't put it past her to try to steal them.  NTA!!!!!!!!!!!", "NTA\n\nShe said she didn't want anything to do with them. At that point they stopped being her dogs. They were definitely happier staying with you that they knew than the stress of actual rehoming.", "She... literally wanted the dogs to suffer, possibly getting separated and definitely needed to adapt to a new home and routine because... and that's where I draw a blank. \n\nNTA. You did rehome them. To you.", "NTA.  She didn\u2019t care enough about them when she up and left.  Why does she care now?  Sounds like she\u2019s jealous you and the dogs are doing well together.", "NTA. You're a good dog Dad OP!!! Your ex is unhappy because you're happy and that most likely won't change lmao", "NTA - YOU DID REHOME THEM.  Before they were registered with her, now they're with you.   Ignore her and anyone who agrees with her!", "NTA. She left you and the dogs. She cared for you both equally, which was not at all. She realises the grass isn\u2019t greener on the other side and comes back with her tail between her legs (intended). Sees you and the dogs are happy and have moved on and then try\u2019s to bring you down and guilt you r whatever she was trying to do just because she is miserable. Just keep on walking those dogs and enjoy your lives together. Forget her.", "NTA. She didn\u2019t want them, so you kept them. She can\u2019t expect you to dump them at the shelter, just because she doesn\u2019t want you to have them. You did nothing wrong.", "NTA-You did the right thing for the dogs and yourself. Obviously not so much for your ex. LOL", "NTA - you did re-home them.....to your home.", "NTA. Good thing you kept the dogs and not the girl.", "NtA she is though.", "NTA at all. \nOp kept 2 dogs ex left. I\u2019m glad dogs weren\u2019t sent somewhere else potentially they could have been put down.\nCongrats on happy life of OP with new gf and dogs.", "Huge NTA. Whatever the opposite of TA is, you are that.", "NTA. That woman *abandoned* the dogs you gifted her and you had every right to rehome them to yourself.", "NTA. She rehomed them by running off. Enjoy life with your pups. Just go absolutely NC and keep an eye on the doggos.", "NTA.  Good for you for keeping them!  She says your the asshole?  Who ran off and left them behind?", "NTA - you made the best of a sad situation.  she should have genuine gratitude that the two dogs did not have to suffer a minute of fear or anxiety getting used to a new human or a new house or WORSE...a cold 3 by 5 foot slab of concrete alone in a noisy building.  this chick is a selfish loser!", "NTA. She abandoned the dogs, you rehomed them. Sure you're the new home but she has no say in that.", "NTA.\n\nTell her if she wants to pursue this matter she can do so through an attorney as legal action will be necessary.", "NTA. She made it clear she didn\u2019t want them she has no right to say anything just ignore her.", "NTA.  You did rehome the dog, it's just your home.  She has no obligation to the dogs anymore once she said to rehome them.  You don't owe her anything, as it's your dog now and they are registered under your name.  Your ex is just jealous that you have moved on and the dogs are happy with someoene else that's not her.", "NTA \nDon't ever let her convince you to give her back those precious puppies.", "NTA.  You told you to rehome them so you did.  To yourself.", "NTA.\n\nShe's just bitter and salty that you're happy now. \nShe abandoned the dogs, therefore she has no say in what you do with them afterwards. \n\nKeep those good boys and be happy.", "NTA. She lost her right to dictate what happened to the dogs when she abandoned them. Trying to say \u201cI don\u2019t want them, but I also don\u2019t want you to keep giving them the good home they are used to\u201d is a bullshit move and she deserves to see them happy with you. Keep loving the puppers and ignore her.", "NTA.  The well being of the dogs would be priority if she gave a single care about them.  They obviously weren't pets to her.  Just accessories.   \n\nGlad you and the dogs no longer live with that petty adult brat.", "Obvious NTA. She abandoned them. You would be TA if you gave them back to this person.", "NTA. Just NTA.", "NTA. She\u2019s just angry you are happy and someone filled her place", "NTA she lost the chance to have a say when she left!", "Hot damn, F**K this person. Dogs are not a memento from a relationship, they become your family. Dodged a bullet when she left you my dude.\n\nNTA", "NTA. By keeping the dogs, you kept them from the trauma of being rehomed. If you ex cared about the dogs, she would have asked you to take care of them instead.\n\n`She says that I'm an asshole for keeping something so meaningful from our relationship.`\n\nThe dogs aren't \"things\". They are living creatures who deserve stability in their lives.", "NTA- She abandoned the dogs when she ran off with some other guy. She no longer gets a say in what you do.", "NTA.", "NTA. I think what she's really upset about is that she's alone now and you're with someone.", "NTA - I would bet anything she\u2019s salty the dogs didn\u2019t even miss her or act excited when she saw them. She\u2019s having a case of regret for thinking the grass was greener and being a bit of a shrew.", "NTA. I can't see in what world that you would be.  Don't pay her any mind, she's jealous.", "NTA\n\nYou got the dogs when you were with her, for her?  So you've been in the dogs lives from the start?  Great!  \n\nEnjoy your dogs!", "NTA - you took care of those dogs", "NTA\n\nYou did right by the dogs - they are comfortable being with you, and you took steps to provide them with a safe, loving home. By all accounts, they are your dogs now.", "NTA shes just trying to start drama because her relationship didnt work", "This literally has to be one of the easiest NTA, I've ever read. You did rehome them. With only you! Great owner.", "NTA. You were going to give them back to her. She told you to rehome them, so you did...with yourself. They are now successfully rehomed.\n\nIt's strange she even cares the dogs are still with you. She didn't want them. She relinquished her right to have any say in their future when she left them behind. You shouldn't feel bad for even one second.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

NTA", "NTA and good for you for keeping them!! And congrats on the new gf!", "NTA. She abandoned \"her\" dogs. How does she not see that? I understand sometimes rehoming is necessary, but it is traumatic for dogs, and this is absolutely not one of those cases. You are being responsible by giving your dogs a stable, happy, loving home. Also, clearly, she doesn't have a high regard for animals. That says something about her character. You dodged a bullet.", "NTA. You did rehome them. In your home and name with the Vet. Her getting upset when the option was the shelter. Hope she never gets another dog.", "Definitely NTA. You're a decent human being. She doesn't get a say in this anymore. You did rehome them.  With you.", "You DID rehome them! It\u2019s just you didn\u2019t pay the shelter a \u201crehoming\u201d fee. \n\nThere is no other difference between you doing what she asked and you taking them to a shelter and then immediately adopting them.\n\nOfficially, our elderly Tom cat is \u201cnot\u201d ours, we are only fostering him for the local shelter. He was in our garden, he had a bad foot, he was a stray - they paid for his vet treatment and neutering but asked whether we could foster him as the cattery was full. That was in 2016 lmao!\n\nEDIT NTA", "NTA. You rehomed the dogs. She sucks.", "NTA. A pet isn\u2019t the type of possession to be tossed aside.", "Not to mention, dogs have attachments and emotions. She doesn't seem to get that. NTA. Your ex, on the other hand...yikes. I hope she never has another pet because it sounds like she doesn't respect them.", "NTA. You kept dogs you shared with your ex in their home with one of their human parents.  You are a good dog dad.  Your ex is a different story. Also DOG TAX!!!", "NTA\n\nShe's just bitter.", "NTA\n\nBest revenge is living well ig.", "Helllllll no. NTA\n\nYour ex is a jealous and vindictive asshole. Her game plan didn't work out and she doesn't like seeing you, the dogs, and your new girlfriend enjoying life together.", "NTA at all! You let them stay in a home they were familiar and comfortable with. If she cared about them at all, she would be happy that they're happy and safe. She's trash and it sounds like you dodged a bullet and got a pretty sweet parting gift.", "You were entitled to full canine custody and enforced it.  You've chosen wisely.  NTA.", "Lmao NTA but she sure is.", "NTA, she doesn\u2019t get any say whatsoever, she gave up any sense of ownership. You need to block her and move on, she\u2019s drama.", "NTA. She left. She doesn't get to dictate what happens with the pets. Just block your ex on every platform or ignore her when you see her in person and continue living a happy life with the dogs. She's your ex for a reason, forget about her.", "I was about to say the same thing lol OP NTA", "NTA\n\nI was going to say the same thing!", "I love this comment", "This is the answer. She's just mad that OP is happy and she's not.", "Yup! OP did the right thing, the dogs deserve stability. She\u2019s just mad to see him happy with someone else and the dogs. That is projection at its worst.", "Pretty sure it has more to do with the new girlfriend walking the dogs with OP.
