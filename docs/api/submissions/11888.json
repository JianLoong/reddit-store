Then, when she sees the pups have landed on all 8 of their feet with you ... safe, happy, goin' on a stroll ... she's angry. \n\nWow. What a peach. You totally should have snapped her up while you had the chance. /s\n\nNTA.", "Totally NTA.  She told you to guarantee they have a new home. And you did, with you.  She doesn\u2019t get to abandon them and micromanage who their new owner is - if she wanted those rights, she should have overseen the rehoming herself.\n\nWhat you did was best - it honestly made the best of a bad situation with respect to yourself, and also it was absolutely the best possible situation for the dogs. She should be happy about that, if she really loved those dogs - their welfare is top priority.  Instead her bitterness and hatred towards you and your new GF has taken priority.  Which is exactly why nobody should give a fuck about what she thinks about this situation.", "NTA.   \nTell her that the dogs didn't leave. She did.   \nYou've got nothing against the dogs.", "NTA.\n\nYou did rehome them - from a home with her and you, to a home with you and new GF. \n\nBonus for the dogs, they had someone they knew and trusted with them through that transition and were never in danger of being put down due to kennel overpopulation.", "NTA", "Nta. You did remove them,  with yourself.", "Your ex makes me sad. How could she have such little regard for a living thing. Sounds like she's a spoiled brat. And an asshole.", "NTA, at all.\n\nEnjoy your life, dogs, and girlfriend, and ignore/block the human cancer.", "..... so if you had a kid with her.\n\nAsked her what she wanted to do with the kid.\n\nShe said rehome them.\n\nBut you chose to keep and look after your kid\n\nAre you the AH because those kids had meaning in your relationship with her?\n\nLMAO what a joke", "Phew, thank goodness she is an ex.  Someone who lacks compassion on their own dogs and just toss them out like they are just used furniture don't make a good partner in my book.", "Absolutely NTA. You\u2019re ex-girlfriend absolutely is. Enjoy your happy life with your great dogs and new girlfriend. :)", "NTA!  You're a good dog dad.", "NTA. This is not about the dogs. It is about how happy your life is now and how your ex's life turned to shit. Ignore her and boop the puppies for me.", "I\u2019ve never seen something so clearly NTA in my life.\n\nYour ex literally abandoned her dogs. She gets no fucking say in what happens to them now.", "NTA - you did \"rehome\" them.... just with yourself. Plus I am sure the dogs are happy and well taken care of and that's what actually matters. F her.", "NTA and glad you got rid of that gf because that\u2019s ridiculous. \n\nWho would prefer their dogs to be rehomed to a stranger instead of cared for by a person they were already familiar with?! A psycho.", "100% absolutely NTA. Don\u2019t ever even question that again. You did the right thing.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou liked the dogs more than her. Good job on keeping them.", "NTA she is a truly terrible pet owner and has no business telling you anything.  I think you made out well in this situation though, the dogs are way better than her!", "NTA. Your ex girlfriend is a messed up person if she thinks two dogs who have known you as their caregiver should go to home(s) with strangers who may neglect or abuse them. She doesn't care about them. She just wants to hurt you. She shouldn't be allowed to have pets or kids tbh", "Dang, if this is how she thinks about living, breathing mammals\u2026I hope she never has kids.", "Nta, she abandoned them after she left them with you. My ex and I had a dog, and we mutually decided he would go with my ex, because at the time he could take better care of him. My ex is dating someone I think (i don\u2019t keep tabs, but good for him if it\u2019s true) and I have no resentment and would never show up to claim the doggie again, that would be so weird. As far as I\u2019m concerned he was my dog and I\u2019ll always love him, but life moves on and he definitely belongs to my ex and whoever he\u2019s with. If for whatever reason he couldn\u2019t keep him anymore I\u2019d definitely take him, but yeah I\u2019d never come and claim him. You have all the paperwork in your name, so you\u2019re all good just block her.", "Dang, if this is how she thinks about living, breathing mammals\u2026I hope she never has kids.", "NTA. This post made me smirk. You and especially the dogs are the real winners here :)", "OP, just send this comment to her. That\u2019s all you need.", "Perfect comment. NTA Glad ex self selected her way out of your and dog\u2019s lives.", "OP rehomed them better than gf rehomed herself \ud83d\ude1d", "Are we surprised the unstable X is also weird and selfish about a living breathing thing?", "Godamn, OP dodge a nuclear bolter.", "Came here to say this. They\u2019re living beings. \nIf you get divorced, should your child go to some random family bc you can\u2019t decide which parent \u201cdeserves\u201d them? \n\nShe\u2019s just bitter. This isn\u2019t an engagement ring or special painting. It\u2019s animals.", "Just want to add that if she cared about the dogs, OP wouldnt have had to reach out in the first place to ask what to do with them after she took off. Agreed, NTA.", "Agreed. Also, if they were so meaningful, she wouldn't have abandoned the dogs.", "Your ex is the AH. Make better choices next time. She sounds like a HO.", "NTA. My ex-husband and I had three cats during our marriage. One was gifted to me, one we got so that the first had a companion, and the third we took in. When we split, do you think we rehomed?? From what I heard, he still has the third cat we got. Meanwhile, I got the two peas in a pod. It would have been absolutely stupid for us to rehome animals we got while together. She left the dogs with you. She abandoned them. Honestly, she lost the right to a conversation the moment she walked out without them. Oh, also, gotta ask for the dog tax.", "NTA tell her to kick rocks.", "You are NTA. She is an AH through and through, from her response to you having the dogs from what she did with the relationship. May you never see her in town again.", "NTA. You did as she asked.  You re-homed them to you. \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23.  I\u2019m sure the dogs are happy!", "Pfft. You should tell her she's the asshole for abandoning them!\n\nNTA", "Your girlfriend sounds like the asshole. If I up and left, I would at least be happy to know someone is taking care of my dogs I loved so dearly. This woman clearly does not give two shits about the dog.", "NTA. Exactly. It may bother your ex, but clearly you're the owner they dreamed about!", "NTA. And make sure your ex doesn't have access to them. Change locks. Ring cameras. And tell dog care she isn't allowed to pick them up. Vet too", "Right on.  Shame on her.  She abandoned the dogs and you.  She doesn\u2019t get a say as to what happens to them.  \n\nGood luck and awesome job taking them in.  She can\u2019t be trusted in a relationship or with dogs.", "NTA\nYou did rehome them. To you.", "NTA - you did rehome them, with a loving, caring owner who cares about them in the long term, you...\n\nShe can go kick rocks.", "My god, this woman makes me so damn angry! If they were so meaningful to her, she wouldn't have abandoned them in the first place. She DID abandon them, and she has absolutely no say about them now, because they are no longer hers. What a selfish, narcissistic ass she is.\n\nYou are NTA. You are a wonderful, loving, and responsible pet parent. Keep those pups safe from this dreadful person.", "NTA.", "NTA-\n\nRehoming pets is a last resort option. They are sentient beings. There's no need to make them feel abandoned when you are willing and able to give them a happy home. Why does she care as long as she doesn't want them? She thinks they and you should be unhappy just because she wants to control where they go? You are so lucky you aren't with her anymore.", "NTA.  They\u2019re not your ex girlfriends dogs anymore.", "NTA\u2026..the dogs meant so much to her, she left them behind with no care for what happened to them\u2026they were re-homed\u2026.they went from y\u2019all\u2019s home to your home!", "NTA and good riddance.", "You are the complete opposite of the asshole. You actually cared about the dogs and their well being, rather than dumping them somewhere, which she undoubtedly would have done. Also, legally, she has no say anymore, so she can suck it.", "NTA - She is just mad youre happy and have a good life", "NTA. She didn't want them. She just doesn't want you to have them. It's petty and selfish and childish.", "NTA - you did rehome the dogs.  With you. She's just jealous that you have moved on.", "NTA you re-homed them to your home.", "Clearly she didn\u2019t deem them quite so \u2018meaningful\u2019 when she abandoned them.  NTA", "NTA but why are you so concerned with what your ex thinks", "NTA", "NTA. You are giving abandoned dogs a loving home.", "NTA.\n\nShe ditched them! She literally left them behind, and for that alone, she should no longer get a say in what happens to them. But you also did exactly what she told you to do, and you transferred all paperwork over to yourself. You kept the dogs from going through the trauma of re-homing. \n\nNTA, OP, enjoy your good doggos.", "NTA\n\nYou did rehome them...in your house...\n\nShe doesn't get a say after she literally left them without a second thought", "> I just like the dogs. More than I liked her to be honest\n\nHoly shit man. I hope you said this to her face with your new GF in earshot. \n\nIt would make everything perfectly clear to both women in one beautiful sentence\n\n\n\nedit: NTA", "Major win for you here dude i hope she hated seeing you do well for yourself without her a lot, absolute legend, NTA.", "NTA!! Why should you give up dogs she abandoned? She\u2019s more than an AH!", "Perfect comment", "First thing that came to my mind. OP you are NTA.", ">told you to rehome them so you did.\n\nGoing to omit your error there and that is all there is to it. \n\nEx just got buyers remorse and trying to use you as a free pet sitter.\n\nAnyone who would re-home dogs on whim like that don't deserve dogs.", "r/AwardSpeechEdits", "NTA X 100k. You did a wonderful thing, thank you. People like your ex simply shouldn't be allowed to have pets.", "NTA\nShe sounds horrible. I'd be sure your locks aren't the same as when she lived there and maybe airtag their collars just in case she's that level of vindictive. I'd never give up my pups or send them away like she wanted!", "It sounds like the one thing in that relationship that was NOT meaningful was your ex.", "Sounds like he has found his forever family."]}
