Makes no sense whatsoever. This happened to my granny, but luckily she didn't fall for it. This literally happened like a month a go, she's 100 and told em to put it where the sun don't shine only in words that will get me banned lol.", "LMAO NTA \nIf he needs money for some other reason he should ask", "You're not involved. He's old enough AND young enough that he should have known better and not fallen for that crap. NTA", "Pro Uno Reverso move", "My Pop-pop is 93 and that didn\u2019t work on him, he immediately called my mom instead of sending money", "Two of my uncles got this scam call.\n\nOne successfully sent the money. The other screwed up the transfer number and it didn't go through.", "A couple years back my Pop-pop got a call from \u201cme\u201d saying I was in jail and needed bail, and he immediately called my mom who let him know that I was fine and was never in jail", "Scam me once, strike one. But scam me twice... strike three.", "Okay, I\u2019ve never had children, but if anybody ever tries this scam on me, this is exactly what I\u2019m going to say.", "NTA.  If they used your name, he may think you were in on it. However,  scammers often find out names of relatives in advance or just use a common name and hope the person knows someone named John or Maria or whatever. You were not in on the scam. This is not your fault or your responsibility.", "Nta. That scam has been around long enough it's his fault for falling for it", "I'm a Nigerian prince. I can help. Send me your uncle's...", "INFO: Does uncle know that OP was NOT ACTUALLY in a Mexican prison? If not, then he is justified in asking for his money back.", "NTA   It's not your fault he didn't check first.  \n\nIt was a nice thing to do though.  Still not on you.", "Something like that happened to my mom one time that they were claiming they were her nephew but once they ask for money she was like nope!\nHowever another nephew called my mom and said that he was at the local police station arrested and she was about to go over there when he called her back letting her know that he was just pranking her. Sigh! \ud83d\ude25", "My son told me that now there is a new scam where AI programs can call your phone and actually sound like the voices of your family members, not sure if it is true but he is super interested about artificial intelligence and follows all the information out about them", "There are actually forums on the internet full of people who string scammers along as a hobby and rack up points for how far they get them to go. Generally scammers throw out a ton of lures but once someone responds they drastically narrow their focus so wasting their time prevents them from going after someone else."]}
