Your uncle fell for a scam and wants money from you because the scam just happened to be about his nephew? \n\nI\u2019d suggest to your uncle that he maybe he should consider an IT awareness course. Or a common sense course. Either way, you owe him nothing. Just call it idiot tax.", "NTA\n\nHe was scammed, which is horrible, but not remotely your fault, especially since you weren't travelling in Mexico at the time and a he clearly didn't check with anyone before sending money.\n\nYou don't owe him the money but perhaps you can help him report the crime (not that there's much chance of retrieving his money) and help him get some really good training in his to spot phishing and other scams, how to protect himself online.", "NTA. Not your fault he got duped. He learned a valuable lesson and it only cost him $2300.", "NTA. It was his fault for falling for a scammer and he is making you pay for the consequences of his actions. What kind of thinking is that?", "NTA. What in the world is his argument that you owe this money? Does he think you brought this onto him in some way?

I hope that you appreciate that he unwaveringly jumped to help what he thought was you in a shit situation... but you can't be responsobile for the fact that he lacks  awarness of how the scams work.\n\nThe one thing I would say is that, *as long as you can broach the subject in a way that won't shame him or make him feel more hurt than he already is,* groups like AARP offer classes which are intended to help people gain better financial literacy for these kinds of situations. Some are probably free. Some cost money, and maybe paying for one of those, if it is particularly well reviewed, would be worth doing (but again, don't do this if it might make the situation worse for him).", "NTA. You weren\u2019t involved.", "I work in finance and deal with scammers somewhat regularly. Your uncle has to file a complaint with his bank, giving necessary information about the scam.

She immediately hung up on the person and called my dad, who called my brother, who was safe at home in Phoenix. The scammers attempted to call her back multiple times until she just shut her phone off.\n\nIt completely sucks that there are people out there who will scam older people out of money using this kind of emotional ploy, but it's not the OP's responsibility to pay back his uncle. The uncle should contact his credit-card company or bank and see if there's anything they can do (unlikely, but worth a call).", "School fees", "\u201cSorry Uncle Rico, I just sent you the money last week!\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cWait, you didn\u2019t get it?

Even my 74 year old mum had the sense to call my usual number to check this text had been sent by me before she dialled the number she was sent that would have probably cost \u00a310 a minute to dial. And if she had of dialled it and got scammed she wouldn't have been short sighted enough to blame me for it or expect me to cover the cost of the amount she was scammed for. The mentality of some people astounds me at times. Tell your uncle you are not responsible for him being scammed, he didn't send you the money so you are not obliged to pay him back.

Worst part is that I do travel, so it's not like my being out of the country wasn't a possibility. My mom was terrified, because the scammer heavily implied that very unfortunate things would happen to me if they didn't pay. She thankfully called me while dad stalled and was looking up the number for the embassy, but I've never heard her sound like that. They never told me exactly what the scammer threatened, but it was clearly pretty bad. Those fucks are horrible people, and they prey on fear.\n\nOP still isn't responsible, but I can understand why the uncle fell for it."]}
