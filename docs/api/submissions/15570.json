My grandparents once got a call saying I was in jail in California and needed about $4,000 to pay my bail. They messaged me to ask where I was, and I told them I was in my house. Your uncle failed to check for validity.", "NTA. What? This is laughable. Your uncle fell for a scam and wants money from you because the scam just happened to be about his nephew? \n\nI\u2019d suggest to your uncle that he maybe he should consider an IT awareness course. Or a common sense course. Either way, you owe him nothing. Just call it idiot tax.", "NTA\n\nHe was scammed, which is horrible, but not remotely your fault, especially since you weren't travelling in Mexico at the time and a he clearly didn't check with anyone before sending money.\n\nYou don't owe him the money but perhaps you can help him report the crime (not that there's much chance of retrieving his money) and help him get some really good training in his to spot phishing and other scams, how to protect himself online.", "NTA. Not your fault he got duped. He learned a valuable lesson and it only cost him $2300.", "NTA. It was his fault for falling for a scammer and he is making you pay for the consequences of his actions. What kind of thinking is that?", "NTA. What in the world is his argument that you owe this money? Does he think you brought this onto him in some way? As you noted, you didn't scam him, and if he'd contacted you earlier you could have saved him some money and heartache, but he didn't do that either. Unless there is some other history here that would account for these things, you absolutely are not responsible for his bad choices.", "SURPRISE TWIST: You\u2019re uncle never sent anyone any money, and he\u2019s scamming *you*\n\nOK. Not likely, but no stupider than what he\u2019s asking for. You are NTA.", "NTA That's like him being upset because of something you did a dream. Silly.", "NTA\n\nThis is not in any way your fault. \n\nIt was sweet of him to bail you out, he didn't have to, but at the end of the day he fell for one of the most well-known scams there is.", "NTA.  This just nothing to do with you at all.  Horrible that it happened, but you have no more obligation to pay him back than you would if someone walked in and stole the money from his home.", "NTA - tell him you fell for the same scam but sent 20k to Canada to get him out of jail and see if he'll pay you.", "NTA why should you pay? It's unfortunate he fell for a scammer but it isn't your fault in any way", "NTA\n\nIt's not your fault he was scammed. You aren't responsible for his monetary loss.

I hope that you appreciate that he unwaveringly jumped to help what he thought was you in a shit situation... but you can't be responsobile for the fact that he lacks  awarness of how the scams work.\n\nThe one thing I would say is that, *as long as you can broach the subject in a way that won't shame him or make him feel more hurt than he already is,* groups like AARP offer classes which are intended to help people gain better financial literacy for these kinds of situations. Some are probably free. Some cost money, and maybe paying for one of those, if it is particularly well reviewed, would be worth doing (but again, don't do this if it might make the situation worse for him).", "NTA. You weren\u2019t involved.", "I work in finance and deal with scammers somewhat regularly. Your uncle has to file a complaint with his bank, giving necessary information about the scam. Even then, he might not get that money back, as scammers move their money fast.\n\nAs for you, NTA. You're not responsible for what happened in the slightest.", "I'm completely confused. Why does he think YOU owe him the money?\n\nYou don't owe him the money anymore than the cashier at the corner store does, or the kid who mows the lawns down the street. You have no connection whatsoever to this.\n\n\n\n.", "This scam has been around for awhile, because about 10 years ago my grandmother (who's since passed) got a similar call in the middle of the night about my brother being in jail in Mexico. She immediately hung up on the person and called my dad, who called my brother, who was safe at home in Phoenix. The scammers attempted to call her back multiple times until she just shut her phone off.\n\nIt completely sucks that there are people out there who will scam older people out of money using this kind of emotional ploy, but it's not the OP's responsibility to pay back his uncle. The uncle should contact his credit-card company or bank and see if there's anything they can do (unlikely, but worth a call).", "School fees"]}
