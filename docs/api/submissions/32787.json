My roommate takes it upon herself to make \u201cdate night\u201d food for us despite us saying she doesn\u2019t need to. This ofcourse would mean she would be joining us, since she\u2019d make food for 3 people. Sometimes she\u2019d try and squeeze in and participate when my partner and I are cooking together. It\u2019s a small apartment so I let it go given that she is nice enough to make us food occasionally. \n\nRecently I\u2019ve noticed her mentioning my partner more often. She\u2019d show me videos and go \u201cOh, (bf) would like this. WE should make/ get it for him\u201d. She would ask more often if I\u2019m meeting him or if he\u2019s coming over so she can \u201cprepare\u201d. She\u2019s also added him on all his socials, which again, isn\u2019t that weird on its own - but all together? Idk. \n\nSo the other day, she made dinner for us again, this time she had wine and seafood. I\u2019m severely allergic to seafood. I literally go back to the apartment from time to time saying \u201comg I forgot my epipen\u201d. I\u2019ve also showed her a photo of when I completely swelled up after accidentally eating squid. This was months ago though so again, not a completely black and white scenario. \n\nWhen I couldn\u2019t eat dinner, my partner suggested we go out for dinner instead - as in me and him. She started crying, saying she worked hard on dinner that night. She wasn\u2019t stopping us from leaving but her crying made the whole situation uncomfortable.\n\nWhen my partner left to get me dinner, I asked her is she had feelings for my partner. She was so offended, saying she had been nothing but nice and welcoming to both of us.

The crying incident during the seafood dinner was uncomfortable, and it's reasonable to wonder about her feelings. Expressing your concerns was a fair move to address the growing awkwardness in your living situation.", "NTA, she's acting pretty weird. I wouldn't want someone constantly inserting themselves into my relationship like that. I can definitely see why you'd be suspicious though. Of course she's going to deny any feelings for him if you ask her.", "I live with my best friends they are an engaged couple and I can tell you that the behaviour she is exhibiting is weird. \nI do majority of the cooking in our house but I'd never make something one person is allergic too and have a cry about it. Yeah alot of the time I'm a bit of a third wheel but im often invited to do activities with them. I never intrude on actual date nights I always let them have alone time and I don't sulk about the relationship that they have together... I support it!\nI never just impose myself on the time they spend together. \nSet some boundaries for her, tell her that while you appreciate the cooking you won't be taking part in that any more ( as it's a potential danger to you ). Obviously you can't expect her to hide in her room while your partner is there but if you are cooking she doesn't need to be involved.\nNTA", "NTA. Given y\u2019all aren\u2019t close, she\u2019s not trying to not lose you. Otherwise she would\u2019ve been making attempts beforehand as such to spend time with you. Not when your boyfriend is around. She\u2019s trynna be a homewrecker", "Ok. Yes. YTA for assuming she has feelings for your boyfriend - it sounds to me like she's maybe decided that you two are her FRIENDS, and that cooking for you and hanging out together is something friends do. She also lives with you, so perhaps befriending your bf is her way of making his visits over feel more fun and less like having an unintentional third roommate. It genuinely sounds to me like she thinks she's being sweet and welcoming and truly not realizing it feels like an intrusion to you two. (A girl who wanted to steal your man wouldn't be showing you cute stuff he'd like - she'd be getting it for him and then watching while you flounder to give him a gift he wants)\n\nBut, also, YTA for making this assumption/accusation rather than just gently talking to her beforehand about boundaries. You could have said that you enjoy her company and would like to have her join you as friends, but maybe not every date night. Told her you appreciate the cooking and the kind gestures, but perhaps once a month? And you guys take turns cooking?\n\nThe crying is uncomf - it sounds to me like she has some social issues. Does she have a lot of other friends? But again, based on the evidence here, all I really see is that she genuinely likes you guys and thinks that all three of you have become pals (which clearly isn't the case, or maybe it is the case but she's just harshing the romantic vibe without entirely getting that you want to be alone).", "NTA Yeah she's just weird. Keep your distance, maybe move out. Keep your bf away from her. Go to his place from now on.", "Nta. Maybe you and bae should start meeting up at his place more often, than at your place.", "This sounds like the beginning of a bad Lifetime movie. You are NTA, OP, and if I were you I would spend a whole lot less time socializing with your roommate.", "NTA Even if your roommate is socially inept , she needs to know how to act around other's bfs and husbands. I assume she is a teenager . If she is not a teenager then your assumption is correct. Her behaviour is weird. Calling out is better . Date somewhere else away from this foolish person.", "Yeah I think this is a case of the roommate being lonely and trying to meet that need by third wheeling your relationship. It seems like she wants a boyfriend, but idk if she wants yours specifically OP. \n\nDefinitely time for some boundaries though. Along with communicating with her about how she\u2019s been overstepping, I\u2019d try to spend more time at his place or just out together to help reset the dynamic.\n\nHope the roommate can find her own person to make seafood for, cause it\u2019s def not you and your bf.", "Not only trying to remove her but potentially kill her (depending on how bad the allergy is). This sounds like this person needs to be moved from a roommate to ex-roommate ASAP.", "So weird being an Aussie and seeing sus referenced as a kids saying lol, everything comes full circle I guess", "Get out of here with your reason and logic, this was a god damn assassination attempt you hear me?", "That's an incredibly bad idea", "I'm stateside and in my 30s so I assume it's a word of the youth - life comes at you fast.", "Dude for real. She cooked seafood in their shared space and didn\u2019t let op know ahead of time. \n\nAnd now op has to do the job of caring for this persons feelings when she could\u2019ve landed in the hospital??? GTFO w that. I\u2019d give the benefit of the doubt if she said or did something questionable once but this a repeated behavior that no person, should do. \n\nIf she\u2019s so lonely or worried to lose OP she would\u2019ve been spending time w op beforehand.", "NTA. She\u2019s intruding on your relationship and demonstrating what a great partner she would be. Trying to make the current partner look less domestic is a classic ploy to move in on a marriage or a boyfriend. How many signs do you need? That she would find a way to exclude you and make it all about herself?? Oh, wait, she just did that with the seafood dish and crying when your boyfriend went to buy you food. \n\nTrust your instincts and spend your couple time away from her, whether it\u2019s at his place, out to dinner without her, or a public place like the park or a library. And find yourself a new roommate for next year.", "\u201cHey so you\u2019re not actually being nice, because you\u2019re not respecting boundaries and it is making us very uncomfortable, so we would like a little privacy when my bf is over. So please stop making us food because we\u2019re not going to eat it, we\u2019re also talking about moving in together so when lease is up please don\u2019t expect me to renew it, just wanted to tell you now so you can prepare yourself by finding another roommate.\u201d", "Like, I cook for my friend and her partner sometimes and I do live with them currently, but I'm not going after my friends man. She has feelings for him. She is trying to usurp your place in the relationship to place herself in there.

Seafood is a taste that isn\u2019t universal.. Why would she serve seafood instead of something more universal for all!", "I just saw a TikTok yesterday about a woman who likes making date might meals for her roommate and her roommates bf, what a coincidence. The comments were all saying that the bf should get with the chef.", "Nta pls for the sake of you boyfriend stop bringing him to your apartment it sound like hell for him to deal with your roommate, while he's supposed to be happy and relaxed with his gf", "Seen this exact same scenario at least three different times she's definitely demonstrating some kind of feelings towards him whether she admits it to herself or not. \n\nWhat's that Seinfeld episode you're just friends until the other person's gone and then it's just you're there.", "NTA but your roommate is completely unhinged and dangerous, and you need to move out ASAP.", "NTA but your roommate is completely unhinged and dangerous, and you need to move out ASAP.", "NTA. I think it's time for your bf to stop coming over, and/or for you to find other living arrangement. Because even if she doesn't have feelings for him, preparing seafood for dinner when she knows you're allergic, thus leaving you dinner-less, is definitely very weird. \n\nMaybe it's a good idea to talk to your bf too. Chances are, he sees what she's been doing and is uncomfortable himself, but don't know how to bring it up to you.", "NTA the whole situation sounds odd. If she's not after your partner, then she is at least massively overstepping many boundaries. \n\nIf she really is just trying to be nice,  then maybe she hasn't learned how to be around couples and give them space and privacy? But the thing in this scenario not making sense is that she is only being nice to him, not to you (otherwise she would be considerate of your seafood allergy).\n\nMaybe in the future you should hang out less at your place, and go more often to his. Also go on dates out of the house and don't let her tag along.", "Have you seen the movie 'Single white female'? If not, you should.", "Nta and oh girl. She's shooting her shot and out for your man.", "NTA. Single White Female vibes. Your roommate needs some serious boundaries established.", "NTA. Let her know your boundaries.", "Uhhhh has your roommate been tested for mental health issues?\n\nBecause I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s borderline, but it kinda seems like borderline. Given the weirdly intrusive shift in relationship, crying over you leaving the house, and random decision to cook food you can\u2019t eat.", "She's crushing on him 100%.  You should do one of those youtube is he/she loyal tests but for your roommate lol.", "YTA. Why do you care? Do you not trust him?", "ESH. Ill explain why.\n\nYour perspective- Totally understand where your coming from and why this seems weird, she's absolutely intruded on your relationship somewhat, don't need to repeat the various good points already made,  however.\n\nHer perspective - This could be a huge misunderstanding, as others have said she might not have other friends and is trying to make good impressions. As you said you only told her about the fish allergy once, although if it was just a picture of squid she might have thought it was just squid you were allergic too or just forgot if you only told her once what your allergic to. She potentially cried because she spent x amount of time making fish for 3 people and now only she is eating it (I think? I don't imagine your bf ate fish while you were there?) and so she now has to throw out 2 portions of fish, i could diffidently see someone getting upset about that. Then after all this you say \"Do you have feelings for my bf?\". \n\nOnce again not saying your TA but i feel you should have put boundaries in place before this event or worded it differently like \"Hey i appreciate you cooking but sometimes me and bf want to eat alone etc\" or say some of her actions made you uncomfortable. Going straight to \"Do you have feelings for him\" when you haven't said anything previously is a bit of a nuclear response, i understand that it doesn't sound harsh but to her you are saying \"are you trying to bone my BF?\" Honestly my perspective is yeah she may have overstepped but i dont think she wants to steal your bf, better communication would have fixed this. Hopefully you can have a convo with her to set these boundaries out now.", "YTA. Stay at his house then. Duh.", "NTA, these aren't quite red flags although making the seafood dish and then crying is a bit odd.\n\nIs your roommate by any chance from a different country/culture than you? \n\nThese could all just be harmless things, ranging from them being lonely and wanting to spend time with you both, or then being from a culture that just does things like this for guests visiting. However, she could also have a mad crush on him for all we know. \n\nYou're definitely NTA for having concerns about this and it's good to keep a thought on the situation, but there could equally be nothing there at all so try not to sour things with the roommate until she crosses a line. But again, the seafood thing and the crying is STILL a bit odd", "I feel like if the genders were reversed there'd be ppl saying you're insecure and Get Help etc (if you take the whole crying bit away) i say it is weird she was like that i don't think you were wrong in your position id feel like she liked him myself.", "I think asking is not wrong. I also a single female roommate with a couple. If you had any doubts, it would have been best to talk to her alone and drawing that line of her cooking for all of you. Just let her know, hey, when he's over we can cook for ourselves etc She may have just being nice.", "NTA giant red flag, and I see no scenario where this will not hurt your relationship if you don\u2019t take action and either force hard boundaries on her or make her leave.", "NTA. When you look at all of her behaviors together it does paint a picture, doesn\u2019t it?  She may just think she\u2019s being a good hostess but, she\u2019s going over the top. I think maybe she needs to get out more often.", "NTA", "This reminds me of the \n\nSalt & pepper & cumin episode of how I met your mother \nIf anything show her that episode and be like you see Ted  ?

She is far too involved and it will only become more intense as she continues to ignore boundaries. \nNTA", "Yeah. And maybe look into alternative living arrangements when the lease is up (if possible). Because everything she\u2019s done here hasn\u2019t been good, but cooking a meal that she knew you are deathly allergic to \u201cfor the three of you\u201d is crossing a major line.", "Expressing your concerns was a fair move to address the growing awkwardness in your living situation.", "Yeah also thinking loneliness is the case. She does not seem like she\u2019s into him, but rather feels lonely and want to have friends.\n\nActually I feel bad for her.", "Yes, she's giving off mild stalker vibes ...", "Big Throuple vibes", "Literally came here to say her roommate is going to Single White Female her ass lol", "I get the feeling that she is trying too hard to impress you and be your friend. Socially awkward and missing social cues for sure, but there are a lot of people who are neurodivergent and have the same issues.

I\u2019ve been there and the entire event had me spiral into a panic attack.\n\nPlenty has been mentioned about boundaries. I would sit your roomie down and explain that you think you both need to clarify some things. Go into it with the attitude that it is not a play for him, she will be more receptive for sure.

Reddit is super weird like that you could literally agree with whatever was said and get downvoted a bunch when you started w a bunch of upvotes and girl posts get way more interaction depending on the sub and ppl get more defensive of girls and heated when you agree with the male situations where if it were a girl things would be different.", "Haha a classic", "It\u2019s a word that goes back to at least the 1930s.
