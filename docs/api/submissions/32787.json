My partner (25M) sometimes stays over when we aren\u2019t at his place or outside. My roommate takes it upon herself to make \u201cdate night\u201d food for us despite us saying she doesn\u2019t need to. This ofcourse would mean she would be joining us, since she\u2019d make food for 3 people. Sometimes she\u2019d try and squeeze in and participate when my partner and I are cooking together. It\u2019s a small apartment so I let it go given that she is nice enough to make us food occasionally. \n\nRecently I\u2019ve noticed her mentioning my partner more often. She\u2019d show me videos and go \u201cOh, (bf) would like this. WE should make/ get it for him\u201d. She would ask more often if I\u2019m meeting him or if he\u2019s coming over so she can \u201cprepare\u201d. She\u2019s also added him on all his socials, which again, isn\u2019t that weird on its own - but all together? Idk. \n\nSo the other day, she made dinner for us again, this time she had wine and seafood. I\u2019m severely allergic to seafood. I literally go back to the apartment from time to time saying \u201comg I forgot my epipen\u201d. I\u2019ve also showed her a photo of when I completely swelled up after accidentally eating squid. This was months ago though so again, not a completely black and white scenario. \n\nWhen I couldn\u2019t eat dinner, my partner suggested we go out for dinner instead - as in me and him. She started crying, saying she worked hard on dinner that night. She wasn\u2019t stopping us from leaving but her crying made the whole situation uncomfortable.\n\nWhen my partner left to get me dinner, I asked her is she had feelings for my partner. She was so offended, saying she had been nothing but nice and welcoming to both of us. But it\u2019s not like I was completely unreasonable to think of it right?? \n\nAITA for thinking she has feelings for my partner?", "created_utc": 1702267737, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18flwbd/aita_for_assuming_my_roommate_is_trying_to_get/", "score": 77, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Then she *cried* over his refusal to eat?\n\nYeah... Whether she has admitted or to herself or not, she's not feeling platonic friendship.  That's not the same thing as intentionally trying to steal your boyfriend, but it's a good time to start setting boundaries.", "Even if she doesn\u2019t have feelings for him, she\u2019s demonstrating really questionable boundaries and acting possessive. Maybe she\u2019s jealous or scared of losing you? Or is feeling lonely and wishes she had a relationship? Either way, she\u2019s granting herself an undue place in your relationship, and showing up uninvited way too often. \n\nWhether or not she has romantic feelings for your boyfriend might be beside the point. Maybe it\u2019s time to be blunt with her that she\u2019s welcome as a friend, but it\u2019s getting a little inappropriate and some healthy boundaries need to be established. Maybe start with, \u201cPlease don\u2019t cook us dinner if we don\u2019t ask. It\u2019s very kind of you, and don\u2019t take this personally but it\u2019s uncomfortable.\u201d If she gets upset, maybe remind her you are politely asking her to respect your relationship preferences, just as you would do for her.", "NTA. Based on the title alone, I was ready to give you TA verdict but all of these examples are so weird from a friend. Most friends do NOT care about their friend's boyfriends. They are all acquaintances at best. Making a dish that you're allergic to? Girl is trying to remove you from the picture. If I were you, I'd stop bring the boyfriend over and start going to his place instead.", "NTA, your roommate is being sketch AF though - crying because he left to go get you food since you couldn't eat what she made?\n\nAs the kids say, very sus.", "NTA I will say I\u2019ve added friends SO on socials before once they\u2019re serious. It doesn\u2019t sound like you and your roommate are really friends though\u2026 it\u2019s also unhinged that she made a whole seafood meal in your apartment\u2026 make sure someone cleans everything extensively before you make food again", "NTA she seems to want to live the home life with your boyfriend.", "NTA. hopefully she wasn\u2019t trying to sabotage you or had ill intent by making seafood. \u201cAlmost a year\u201d means lease is almost up. Time to move into bf\u2019s apt.", "NTA. She sounds incredibly possessive and she's crossing  many boundaries here. Try going over to your boyfriend's place instead. Her imposing on your time together is also really weird; maybe she wants to be a throuple. Either way, it's wrong, making you uncomfortable and you should set strict boundaries with her about this.", "NTA and keep your eyes wide open around that one. This could get messy.", "NTA.\n\nYour roommate is wierd as fuck.", "NTA.  You need a new roommate or need to move.  Whether it's feelings or dealing with her own feelings by third wheeling into your relationship, it's not appropriate and by making seafood in your home and not APOLOGIZING for endangering your life, but CRYING because she \"worked so hard\" and no one (read boyfriend) stayed to eat?  Yeah, that's messed AF.  She's not acting right.", "It sounds like she's lonely and enjoys the friendship. It might be a third wheel to you, but does she have other friends? Does she have any family near by? Maybe try to line her up with one of your boyfriends friends? Have a few people over.

The crying incident during the seafood dinner was uncomfortable, and it's reasonable to wonder about her feelings. Expressing your concerns was a fair move to address the growing awkwardness in your living situation.", "NTA, she's acting pretty weird. I wouldn't want someone constantly inserting themselves into my relationship like that. I can definitely see why you'd be suspicious though. Of course she's going to deny any feelings for him if you ask her.", "I live with my best friends they are an engaged couple and I can tell you that the behaviour she is exhibiting is weird. \nI do majority of the cooking in our house but I'd never make something one person is allergic too and have a cry about it. Yeah alot of the time I'm a bit of a third wheel but im often invited to do activities with them. I never intrude on actual date nights I always let them have alone time and I don't sulk about the relationship that they have together... I support it!\nI never just impose myself on the time they spend together. \nSet some boundaries for her, tell her that while you appreciate the cooking you won't be taking part in that any more ( as it's a potential danger to you ). Obviously you can't expect her to hide in her room while your partner is there but if you are cooking she doesn't need to be involved.\nNTA", "NTA. Given y\u2019all aren\u2019t close, she\u2019s not trying to not lose you. Otherwise she would\u2019ve been making attempts beforehand as such to spend time with you. Not when your boyfriend is around. She\u2019s trynna be a homewrecker", "Ok. Yes. YTA for assuming she has feelings for your boyfriend - it sounds to me like she's maybe decided that you two are her FRIENDS, and that cooking for you and hanging out together is something friends do. She also lives with you, so perhaps befriending your bf is her way of making his visits over feel more fun and less like having an unintentional third roommate. It genuinely sounds to me like she thinks she's being sweet and welcoming and truly not realizing it feels like an intrusion to you two. (A girl who wanted to steal your man wouldn't be showing you cute stuff he'd like - she'd be getting it for him and then watching while you flounder to give him a gift he wants)\n\nBut, also, YTA for making this assumption/accusation rather than just gently talking to her beforehand about boundaries. You could have said that you enjoy her company and would like to have her join you as friends, but maybe not every date night. Told her you appreciate the cooking and the kind gestures, but perhaps once a month? And you guys take turns cooking?\n\nThe crying is uncomf - it sounds to me like she has some social issues. Does she have a lot of other friends? But again, based on the evidence here, all I really see is that she genuinely likes you guys and thinks that all three of you have become pals (which clearly isn't the case, or maybe it is the case but she's just harshing the romantic vibe without entirely getting that you want to be alone).", "NTA Yeah she's just weird. Keep your distance, maybe move out. Keep your bf away from her. Go to his place from now on.", "Nta. Maybe you and bae should start meeting up at his place more often, than at your place.", "This sounds like the beginning of a bad Lifetime movie. You are NTA, OP, and if I were you I would spend a whole lot less time socializing with your roommate.", "NTA Even if your roommate is socially inept , she needs to know how to act around other's bfs and husbands. I assume she is a teenager . If she is not a teenager then your assumption is correct. Her behaviour is weird. Calling out is better . Date somewhere else away from this foolish person.", "Yeah I think this is a case of the roommate being lonely and trying to meet that need by third wheeling your relationship. It seems like she wants a boyfriend, but idk if she wants yours specifically OP. \n\nDefinitely time for some boundaries though. Along with communicating with her about how she\u2019s been overstepping, I\u2019d try to spend more time at his place or just out together to help reset the dynamic.\n\nHope the roommate can find her own person to make seafood for, cause it\u2019s def not you and your bf.", "Not only trying to remove her but potentially kill her (depending on how bad the allergy is). This sounds like this person needs to be moved from a roommate to ex-roommate ASAP.", "So weird being an Aussie and seeing sus referenced as a kids saying lol, everything comes full circle I guess", "Get out of here with your reason and logic, this was a god damn assassination attempt you hear me?", "That's an incredibly bad idea", "I'm stateside and in my 30s so I assume it's a word of the youth - life comes at you fast.", "Dude for real. She cooked seafood in their shared space and didn\u2019t let op know ahead of time. \n\nAnd now op has to do the job of caring for this persons feelings when she could\u2019ve landed in the hospital??? GTFO w that. I\u2019d give the benefit of the doubt if she said or did something questionable once but this a repeated behavior that no person, should do. \n\nIf she\u2019s so lonely or worried to lose OP she would\u2019ve been spending time w op beforehand."]}
