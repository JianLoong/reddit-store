Besides, those gifts belong to you and you can do what you want with them.", "NTA\n\nIf he had apologized, (assuming he was in the wrong initially) then this all would be a moot point. \n\nThe gift is a means of avoiding bruising his pride any more. Don't let this happen. Pride grows back, getting bruised is the only way to learn humility.\n\nAll these y t a comments don't understand that the current, \"buy your wife a bag when you mess up\" behavior is terrible and they are only helping to spread the misunderstanding.", "**NTA** \n\nA gift means the item is now your property and you can do with it as you like. \n\nI think your husbands \u201cgifts\u201d were meant to be a symbol of his apology and not become your actual property.  This is not a gift and you are not obligated to accept this. \n\nNext time he should  just apologize properly with words.", "gifts are not an apology. \nSo he will never properly apologize like a grown man and an adult ?", "Nta. Don't let him buy his way out of arguments.", "NTA. These gifts are meant to buy your compliance. This is a pattern that will continue. No apology/ understanding. Next he'll pretend like it never happened and expect you to pretend like it never happened also.", "NTA. Gifts are exactly that and the receiver can do with them what they wish. Hopefully next time your husband will actually work through the issue instead of trying to bribe you.", "NTA. First of all, gifts, once given, belong to the person they are given to and they are free to do what they want with them. \n\nSecond, these gifts are an attempt by your husband to avoid dealing with the issue which caused the fight. An apology is actually coming up to you and saying he is sorry.\n\nIt is good that the two of you worked through the issues that caused the fight, but he needs to take this as a lesson that he can't buy his way out of a fight. The gifts were given away - the milk is spilt, there is no putting it back in the container. Basically, he wants you to say that him giving you stuff made you happy, which wasn't true.", "NTA. If gifts meant apologies then I would be drowning in gifts. An apology is about words, actions, accountability and change. If these four aren\u2019t met, it\u2019s not an apology. Someone may say they\u2019re sorry, but if they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re apologizing for, how/why it hurt an individual, proposed or shown a behavior of change, then it is not an apology. Of course it also depends on the offense.", "NTA. I undestrand your point of view, you want to have a proper conversation and work through the problem, while he just bought stuff in the hope of solving the problem, or so it seemed. He failed to properly communicate with you and see what you wanted, instead he just did what he felt like doing. A gift is something that should make the reciever happy, you were right to give them away, and he should not employ this kind of tactics in the future.", "NTA and maybe for the next apology gift ask him for a gift card for a good divorce lawyer.", "NTA...\n\nJust like a previous poster mentioned...  If they are truly gifts, you can do with them what you wish.  One example that comes to mind is a wedding or engagement ring.  Say the wedding is called off, can the groom demand to have the ring back?  The answer is 'no'.  He can ask, but the bride is not required to give it back, as it is considered a gift.", "NTA\n\nAttempting to just give you stuff and pretend nothing happened is a bad tone to set, especially as it\u2019s your first big fight. This was probably a good lesson for both of you about how to disagree and what you both need. Having the physical reminders around from your fight is not something you appreciate and gave the gift to someone you know will appreciate it. If it\u2019s a gift, it\u2019s yours to do with as you want. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve communicated with your husband why you gave them away, but I hope that will help him understand where you\u2019re coming from. I can\u2019t remember what my first big fight with my husband was about, but I remember how I felt and how we worked through it. More than 20 yrs later it has stuck with me and taught me how we can respectfully disagree and how to reconcile.", "I think NAH. He may have just been panicking and not known how to handle a conflict that big, it happens, he\u2019s human. You set the precedent that gifts don\u2019t make things okay and I think that\u2019s good, but I do not fault him for being upset that expensive gifts he got for you were given away. If I were you, I would\u2019ve refused the gifts and given them back to HIM, not given them away. Regardless of the technicality that \u2018gifts are yours to do with as you please\u2019, most people would be upset if their partner threw away presents they got. I think you guys need to have another convo about the gifts where you explain how the gifts made you feel, explain why you gave them away and explain you understand why he\u2019s hurt and you didn\u2019t mean to hurt him, so in the future it\u2019s important you both agree that fights are resolved by TALKING not by love bombing, and you agree that gifts will not be given away anymore, and if they\u2019re upsetting they\u2019ll either be refused or put away until the issue is resolved. \n\nThis is your husband. Trying to pull lawyer speak of \u201cthe gifts are mine to do with as I please so I can burn them in front of you as it\u2019s my right!\u201d Is a fast way to get divorced, even though everyone on Reddit wants to remind you of this fact. It\u2019s true, yes, but is this really the hill you want to die on? You both learned better ways to handle conflict in the future. Talk it out again, reaffirm the importance of communication and explain to him you understand his feelings and he needs to understand yours and you\u2019ll both move together with a better understanding of each other.", "INFO: Has this always been his method? To shower gifts rather than deal? \n\nIf so and you knew this, ATA.", "I'm going with ESH\n\nHim for thinking that buying gifts is a valid way to apologize, you for basically taking a dump on his effort.", "I N F O: What was the fight about and did he properly apologize or just shower you with gifts?\n\nEdit: NTA He is using the gifts to dodge accountability, and you're right to dislike them and insist he repair like an adult.", "This is a hard one. It sounds like a mistranslation of love languages here. \n\nI'm gonna have to land on ESH. He should have actually apologized and calmly talked things through to work out the core issue... As well as given gifts, if that's what he feels he should do to properly apologize for something big.\n\nYou need to cut the passive-aggressive bullsh!t and communicate with your husband when something is bothering you.", "YTA. I agree that gifts wont solve the main issue...but it was a start and you basically spit in his face at an attempt to mend things by giving them away", "YTA the gifts were an olive branch. You guys need to learn how to communicate with each other, in good times and in bad times. The mature thing to do would be to speak with him calmly about how the gifts made you feel. Learning how to fight and how to make up is crucial to a marriage. (Can't believe you guys didn't figure this out while you were dating.)   \n\n\nOk, he didn't apologize in the manner you prefer. Talk to him about that. Giving away his attempt at an apology is such a slap in the face to him. In his mind, he was doing a good thing and you just sh$t all over it.", "ESH...\n\n1.  Never give away a gift from your husband without discussing first, you hurt his feelings when in his way he was trying to be good\n\n2.  Something to discuss with your husband....a physical gift becomes a permanent reminder of why you received the gift, you should give physical items for something you want remembered.  \n\n\nYou probably need to discuss #2 with him", "YTA", "So, you had a fight. Your husband gives you gifts as an apology and then you give those gifts away because your husband failed to apologize to you in the manner that you preferred?\n\nIs it really so difficult for you to look in the mirror to see that YTA?", "ESH.\n\nYou should have asked him for the receipts so you can go refund the items. \n\nThen you tell him that you'll continue refunding his gifts because keeping them around just reminds you of the fact nothing is resolved until he gives you an apology.\n\nWe teach people how to treat us.

Do you also ask your spouse permission to take a leak in the morning?\n\nReally, how much do you have to run by this person to ensure you're allowed to do it? Is it a gift or is it a leash? If she's not allowed to do with it what she wants, it's no gift.", "Ah, I understand You are one of those people who likes to tear others down, and assume the worst, well that's unfortunate for you, I don't appreciate your negativity and can only assume you are projecting\n\nMy marriage is more than \" just not getting divorced \" it's a relationship of love friendship and devotion, sounds like you're not familiar with the concept. My spouse would never give me a paper bag of dog poop, much less trying to pass it off as a gift. Don't know what world you live in but wow that's a sad one.\n\nI do however show my husband respect when he gives me gifts, when my husband gives me gifts it's because he's showing an act of kindness and love, and it's quite possible OPs husband was trying to do the same. OP doesn't mention if that's how the husband's family dynamics are or not, maybe this man was so far out of his game he didn't know what to do and this is how he tried, or he didn't know how to apologize, or just really want to avoid The conversation but still wanted to end the argument and thought this might be an end to the mean.\n\nI'm not sure I understand your comments but I'll go back to my comment about reading, I never said I run everything by my husband, that's a leap that you took in interpretation.\n\nPlease feel free to go ahead and continue to attack me, I will not be reading or responding, I really prefer positive interactions and am sensing a lot of negative energy from you which I choose not to accept.
