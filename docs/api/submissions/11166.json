My older sister and I were always close but last year she was tragically taken from me in a car crash. Planning my wedding really broke my heart because I always imagined her being a big part of it. It wasn\u2019t the same without her. I had came up with this idea that if my BIL was okay with it, I could wear my sisters wedding dress, which my BIL agreed, and even cried seeing me in it. I looked beautiful, my husband loved it, my brother in law did, but my family did not feel the same way.\n\nMy mother told me it was disrespectful wearing my sisters dress, and that I was just reminding everyone of a life lost. Then she said that it was a line I shouldn\u2019t of crossed. My other two sisters also gave me weird looks. \n\nAfter my honeymoon I posted some wedding pics on Facebook and my mom and sister had commented saying things how I shouldn\u2019t of chose that dress. I confronted my mother and said she was my sister and her husband was okay with it so why is she so strung up on it. She then replied with that she was her daughter, and that I should\u2019ve had my own dress for the wedding not her deceased daughters, and that I was insensitive and it\u2019s not what my sister would\u2019ve wanted. \n\nI looked good in the dress, and I know my sister would\u2019ve thought the same thing.

I feel like it\u2019s more important your sisters husband didn\u2019t take issue with it, after all she was marrying him when she wore it. I\u2019ve never lost a child so I can\u2019t even fathom the pain your mother endured losing a daughter, and the same for you and all your siblings losing a sister, it\u2019s probably harder for some than it is for others. And that\u2019s ok. Grief is different for everyone. I don\u2019t think you were wrong for wanting to remember your sister in this way, it\u2019s probably just hard for your mom and some siblings to see the dress and have those memories brought up at a time when they wanted to be happy and celebrate.", "NTA! I think wearing the dress was a wonderful tribute.

I think you wearing it was a beautiful way to honor your sister's memory.", "Soft YTA.\nI know you and her husband are hurting right now. So is everyone else. It was your wedding, and I know you wanted to have a piece of your sister with you on your special day, however your grief does not supersede anyone else\u2019s. \n\nThere is something therapists use called the circle of grief ring. It means that at the center of the circle are those grieving the most, the next circle are those close to the deceased, then the next are friends and acquaintances. So on and so forth.\n\nThe idea is that as someone in one of the inner rings, you should express your negative feelings and such to those in the outer rings. This way no one is further hurt/ traumatized. Regardless of how her husband feels, your mother and sisters knew and loved her all of her life. They shouldn\u2019t have commented on FB, but I\u2019m guessing the day of your wedding you just popped up in her wedding dress. Wearing her most recent milestone on your own once in a lifetime day. Your mother probably wanted to celebrate you and your big day without focusing on her grief. She wouldn\u2019t have \u201cforgotten\u201d your sister or anything, but she may have wanted to set aside the sadness, but instead she had to watch her dead child\u2019s dress on you. It triggered your half of the family.\nNow the memory for the rest of your family is not centered on you. Its now \u201cboth\u201d of your wedding dresses. Maybe if you happened to get married a few years later everyone would love/ support it, but the wound is still raw.\n\nWill your other sisters be able to wear the wedding dress? Or do you plan to keep/claim it as your own? \nWill your BIL ask for it back?\nIts also a legacy issue. Did your sister have any children? If not, then why was this idea not discussed with your family? I know you didn\u2019t have to, but at the end of the day your choice to do this has hurt several women in your life. Do you want these relationships strained? What is the solution here?\n\nI say it is to apologize, and let them know why you did it. That you wanted to honor her and carry a piece of her with you. Hopefully everyone is able to move past this, but I\u2019m sorry to say I have seen family\u2019s break apart over similar issues. My own grandfather passed yesterday morning, so I say this with as much empathy/sympathy as possible, Do not let this come between you and your family. It is not about who is right/ wrong, its about healing at this point in time, and not allowing fissures to form.\n\nCongrats on your wedding, and I am so sorry to hear about your loss.", "NTA. What a beautiful tribute to your late sister! I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. Congratulations on the nuptials. Your mom is grieving but she should have let it go.", "YTA. You should have told your mom and sisters that you were thinking of wearing your deceased sister\u2019s wedding dress and not worn the dress if it made them feel uncomfortable. This sounds like a \u201cbetter to ask for forgiveness than permission\u201d situation. Also your last comment about looking good in the dress makes me think you wearing the dress was more about wearing a pretty dress and not having to pay for it than really honoring your sister.", "NTA\n\nI get why your mom and sisters didn't like it, but it should not have been that hard for them to pivot to understanding that for you and your BIL it was done as a tribute to your sister and wasn't in any way disrespectful.

At the very least you should have warned them and probably asked what they thought. I'm guessing you didn't because you knew they would object.", "NTA\n\nWhat a lovely way to honor your sister. Her husband was OK with it. That should have been enough to end the conversation right there.", "NTA. First of all, I'm so sorry for your loss! I think that your 'something borrowed' was a beautiful tribute to your late sister. Best wishes going forward!", "Soft YTA. You should have warned your mom and sisters. She wasn't just important to you and they might have responded better if you had told them in advance.", "NTA - I think this is beautiful, I'm surprised she was so upset and not honored you chose to honor your sister like that?", "NTA! Condolences on the loss of your sister. Best wishes on your recent marriage. Beautiful tribute to your sister, especially since you made sure her widower husband was on board. Many a bride wears their mother's or grandmother's wedding gown as a nod to a beloved family member, alive or passed. Seems lovingly generous to want to make your sister such a central to your day, compared to the bridezilla stereotype of a scorched earth 'everything about the wedding must be unique to ME-ME-ME!' attitude.\n\nIt's understandable if seeing you in your sister's dress stirred up grief in your mother. Wedding days are often all about feelings of transition, things are changing even in a positive way, but that's still causes a stress of its own. And weddings often bring to mind sorrow for our loved ones we wish were there to witness it. Is your mother uncomfortable expressing deep feelings about the loss of her daughter? She probably would have been grieving for her on your wedding day even as she was celebrating your happiness whether you were the gown or not. Just my opinion, but I think what you did was an absolutely lovely tribute.", "NAH.  No one who's lost a child will forget that they died. I think your mom is just grieving and this is the current target.", "NTA.\n\nIt\u2019s not as if you\u2019d all have forgotten about your sister that day but for the dress.\n\n(\u201cshouldn\u2019t have\u201d not \u201cshouldn\u2019t of\u201d)", "I was going Not until I saw the judgebot saying you hadn't warned mother or sister.

It probably had a significant impact on her enjoyment of your day.  I don't know how much you look like your sister, but she probably felt like she was seeing a ghost.", "Congratulations. I think it's quite a lovely thing to devote a portion of your own wedding to memorialising someone who couldn't be there. \n\nWould always be emotionally charged, I think it would have been right to discuss with people who were close to your sister beforehand, and listen to any cincerns, but if it was important to you and the BIL supported it, anybody who felt hurt by it should have tried very hard to see it your way. \n\nNTA.", "YTA for the simple fact that you did not warn your mother or family what you are doing. I have a feeling it was because you knew how they would feel so you blindsided a mother who has lost a child with this. I would have said you not AH had you simply sat down with them and given them a heads up as to what you are doing. Not to get permission but to let her prepare for this not get slapped in the face with it. I, personally think your sister would be ashamed of the way you went about it. Not for wearing the dress but by being sneaky and hurtful to her mother.", "Soft YTA - I understand why you did it, but the not consulting your mom or sister beforehand is the AH move.", "NTA you wore that to honor your sister's memory, I don't understand what everybody's problem is with it. I had a moment of silence at my wedding for my deceased mother. Are people just supposed to forget family that have passed?", "NTA!\n\nWhat a fantastic way to include your sister in your celebration!

Yes, you asked BIL but, she wasn't just your sister and his wife. She is your mother's daughter, your sisters' sister. She clearly meant a lot to many of the family members that were there, and are likely still grieving her loss.\n\nMy vote comes down to one thing: did you let them know ahead of time that this was your plan? or did you just show up in a startling reminder of their deceased loved one?\n\nETA: yta\n\nI get you wanted to honor your sister, but losing a child is hard. Someone is still grieving the loss of their child, finding it difficult to go to these types of family events, knowing they won't be there to share in it, is already not in a good place. But to not even give them a heads up? That boarders on cruel.\n\nHad you let them know so they could mentally and emotionally prepare, it would have been n a h, but to just show up?

You make frequent reference to how great you looked in it, but very little about how it honored your sister...", "YTA for not asking your mother or at least warning her.

Hope it sorts itself out for you all.", "YTA because you should have given your family a heads up. You didn't necessarily have to ask for their permission, but they shouldn't have been blindsided.

She was also your sister and friend.\n\nHence why I'm going for NTA instead of n-a-h. But I'll say it's really a gentle rebuke to them and that you may want to answer to them in a more compassionate way, accepting they may still be grieving and differently from you.", "YTA.

But this was a beautiful way to honor her sister and technically the dress is the husbands and he agreed to it.", "I think had op let mom and sisters know ahead of time so they could have prepared themselves, mom and sisters could have seen it differently, as well.", "What a wild take. The sisters husband was ok with it. What the fuck does OP\u2019s family have anything to do with it.", "Because she didn't warn them.  All she had to do was mention it ahead of time and I think they wouldn't have been so shocked.  For the mom this was her dead daughters dress.", "I assure you it is 100% the opposite. Making up with your family won\u2019t happen by continuing an argument every time they speak. They can come back to the topic when tempers are cooled and some time has passed if they want to.", "It's her recently deceased daughter's dress, of course she should have been consulted", "I did miss that part. Thank you.", "YTA big time for not warning them.", "I\u2019m sorry but this is what messes it up for me. You didn\u2019t even bother giving them a heads up, like you want her to be happy for you on your wedding day but you didn\u2019t even bother to tell her that you would be wearing her dead daughters dress", "Why weren\u2019t your sisters in your wedding party? Wouldn\u2019t that have been a great sign of unity and solidarity after having lost one? You are leaving information out of this.", "That is what makes this a problem. How could you not mention it to your mother and sisters?\n\nI'm also taken aback at how much you discuss how great you looked. Seems like a weird detail to mention multiple times given the circumstances.", "What did they think you were wearing? I've NEVER heard of a daughter who was on speaking terms with her mother who didn't talk to her about her wedding dress.", "So you didn't give your mother and sisters a heads up that you would be wearing your late sister's dress? Really?", "Holy s\\*\\*\\*\n\n  \nI can only speak for myself but my sisters and I all look like, well, sisters. Enough that if you were to style our hair/outfits in a similar way, you could easily mistake us for each other. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo you're telling me... \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour mother, who is mourning the loss of her daughter, who was supposed to be married and never got to, and is probably imagining what her deceased daughters wedding could have been, had the experience of looking down the aisle and for a split second, saw her deceased daughters dress walking down the aisle? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nDon't get me wrong, I am so incredibly sorry for your loss. If I lost any of my sisters in an accident, I don't think I could function. I think it's beautiful that you wore her dress to honor her and keep her with you on your day. I don't want to take away from that at all. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut why on EARTH wouldn't you prepare your family for this? I have a hard time justifying \"Oh it just didn't come up\" because it's a wedding, asking about your dress is a pretty common topic. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf neither of them were in your wedding party, can I assume you already have a strained relationship?", "The mother lost her daughter.  I think people underestimate the emotions with that and a surprise here another daughter is in her dead daughters dress.", "It wasn\u2019t her mother\u2019s wedding. Or her sister\u2019s. It always amazes me how many people at a wedding think they\u2019re wedding consultants.\n\nHer mother and sister are certainly entitled to their feelings, but that doesn\u2019t mean the bride did anything wrong. Sometimes people just don\u2019t see eye to eye.", "Neither did I and I think it was deliberately left out of the main post, because it certainly changed my judgement when I read that.", "Thanks, I didn't see that.", "Then definitely NTA.....since your BIL was ok with how you chose to honor ( and he must of been since he gave you the dress)...  \n\n\n Yes everyone deals with grief in different ways.   Not everyone would understand how other choose to do their honors", "She doesn\u2019t indicate one way or the other if they knew in advance does she? She says they didn\u2019t approve, but doesn\u2019t specify when they were told.", "You don't think the mother of the dead girl should have any say? She wasn't even warned", "No I'm sorry. She didn't have to warn anyone but the BIL, first and foremost\n Second, being shocked is one thing but the family has obviously kept it going and let their shock ruin the event. If they were upset they could have talked to her privately", "You apparently haven't lost a daughter like OP's mom recently did.", "Exactly!", "My sister did get married, years ago. This dress is from then I\u2019m not sure where you got that info. And i did not have my hair in the same style", "Are you really not seeing the bigger picture here? She didn't even warn them", "Imagine. Wedding day being shocked by the dress.  Not discussed beforehand to be prepared for the emotions.  You don't see any issue?", "But, op didn't let them know before the wedding. They didn't have time to prepare.", "In the response to the judgement bot and in a comment she said that she did not let them know beforehand.", "It's called empathy and caring for others to warn them. Maybe if you lost a child unexpectedly you'd get it."]}
