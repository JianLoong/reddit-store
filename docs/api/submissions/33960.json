Be sure that he understands what you expect: specifically, gifts at occasions like Christmas and anniversaries. And what you expect those gifts to be; I.e., NOT kitchen items unless you love to cook and particularly want new gadgets. But you can have those conversations clearly and calmly and explain to him what you need. He isn\u2019t able to guess and you need to tell him and then use a technique called mirroring: ask him to tell you back in his own words what you said.

Because neither one of you are finished growing up yet. And this guy is obviously a dirtbag. He took you to his family for Christmas and made you sit there and watch while everybody including him open gifts. You sat there by yourself. Isolated and alone. Watching everyone open gifts. And he did that knowing your family history. He watched you grew up and he knows how your father and stepmother treated you and your brother. And the first Christmas you have with him as your husband he does the exact same thing. In front of his entire family. Maybe he gets off on humiliating you? But maybe there's a little part of yourself that thinks that you don't deserve anything better than this and you're just going to take it and try to work on this marriage. I hope you separate from him and go out on your own and learn how to love yourself and learn to start seeing your own self-worth.", "Oh lord girl, you need to get out.

I hope you have other more supportive friends who will listen when you are in pain.", "Say something. Speak up and tell him you're upset and why.

He\u2019s definitely an AH and, unfortunately, this doesn\u2019t speak well of what your future will be. If you two make it together until next Christmas, you need to give him a dose of his own medicine; no presents for him or his family as they are as rude as he is.  You sound like a giving person.

I don't understand how his family got you nothing, especially since they were so welcoming and they hugged you and everything.\n\nBut your husband...that's just awful.\n\nYou need to explain to him why this is so hurtful.

As in a sitdown conversation with your husband, because while his family is not obligated to buy you presents, it is very hurtful \ud83d\udc94 that your chosen partner dismissed your feelings and you as a person.\n\nHis actions are saying how little you matter to him, and you are right to be worried if it will get worse.", "You handed everyone gifts and watched them open them and not 1 person noticed that you got nothing?  Wtf? \nYour new hubby is an ass, he says he forgot and still hasn't gotten you anything? He didn't think about you once during Christmas.

I'd forget his name and definitely forget going to his family Christmas again, until I got a Christmas present and an apology. This isn't about a gift, it's about respect for you, his family accepting you. I had a friend and his daughter come to my family Christmas and got calls and texts from my mum checking what they would like for Christmas just because they were there on the day, she barely knew them. He should have been planning the gifts from his family with them and been clear that you never got gifts growing up so it's more important than fir most people. This is beyond thoughtless.

He didn\u2019t forget, he just doesn\u2019t care. If he did somehow truly forget, then sitting there on Xmas day seeing you receive no gifts would have jogged his memory. A normal husband would be horrified and do anything they could to rectify the situation. He didn\u2019t forget, you\u2019re just not worth even the bare minimum effort to him.\n\nFor people saying you need to communicate your expectations\u2026you did that. You made it so easy for him and he still couldn\u2019t be bothered. This is not a failure of yours. \n He knows your history of never receiving gifts from your own family, so a normal, decent loving husband would have gone out of his way to make sure your first Xmas as a married couple was special for you.

He thinks that's an adequate answer you should accept.  Your first married Christmas, and he forgot.  Except he didn't.  He just didn't care enough.\n\nThis is your future.  Do you like the look of it?  I hope hope hope you don't.  I hope you find a way to walk away from this, or run if you prefer, get some therapy, and make the choice not to continue the life you're in now.  You're unhappy now and rightfully hurt.  Imagine being 29 and having had been forgotten and invisible and dismissed for the next 10 years.  39?  How unhappy will you be then?  You've deserved much better than your parents, and you deserve more now.  I hope you choose to reach for it.  Good luck!", "Ypu asked for a drawing pad? I bought my grandkids some nice ones for 20 bucks. He couldn't handle that?\nHe is abusive. He won't get you one after either...mark my words.", "Oh my goodness OP, this is heartbreaking.    Please get out of this marriage while you can.  He did not forget.   No one forgets Christmas.   Then he was abusive in telling you it was better than you\u2019d had before because people were there?    Ffs.  \n\nDump him.    He\u2019s showing you how he feels about you.", "The effort you put into presents both for him and his family is admirable. A shame he didn't return the favour.", "Because I was underage at the time", "Yeah, he sent gifts from Amazon to the house for them as well, and he got quite a few things. Namely wireless earbuds from Raycon, a Bluetooth speaker, and a few games for his ps4.", "Program it into calendar everyday for a month next year. \"I am an ass, Buy loving wife meaningful Christmas presents!\"", "Because we're married??? He asked what I wanted??? He said he would order it for me??? He promised this Christmas would be different? Did you even read the post?", "He doesn't want the gift to be shipped too soon and get stolen, because there's a bunch of people who steal packages in our neighborhood. I did ask if it got stolen and he was too embarrassed to admit it, but no. His only excuse was he \"forgot\"", "I'm aware of that but I don't need to be judged about our age difference. I didn't come here for that.", "I didn't tell him how much it hurt, but I did tell him I was mad at him. I figured the hurt would show, especially since he knows how I grew up", "Yes, all of his grandma's children, their spouses, and their kids were there. They all received gifts, I was the only one who didn't", "Yeah, I worked my ass off making those candied pecans and homemade Bailey's. The brownies were box mix but still. The amount of effort I put into my first Christmas with his family, just to get nothing in return, felt so horrible.", "I was hoping not to go all \"Girl, RUN\" on you but that is beyond messed up. Sheds some light on the family's treatment of you. \n\nJob, annulment, therapy - not necessarily in that order but please.", "That sounds deliberate I'm sorry, with him knowing your past and the family giving gifts to each other. He is definitely playing a cruel game with you, don't know about his family, at best he told them not to give you anything but they could also be cold and thoughtless too. \nYou are so young so don't give up on finding a caring partner who will celebrate happy occasions with you instead of putting you to work.", "Girl you seem like you\u2019re going through some stuff so I really don\u2019t want to pile on but \u201cBecause we\u2019re married\u201d being your first response might be telling. You\u2019re expecting a big change in behavior because of the marriage. You have different gift expectations now than when you were dating. All of this is fine but communicate that with your partner if your expectations are now different. There definitely seem to be some communication issues to work on. Good luck!", "Your response should have been, \"I'm glad that I mean so much to you, that I'm easily forgotten \"", "Why couldn't he have it shipped to his parents' house if you're there? Why do you have to wait?\n\nI'm sorry, OP.

His \"forgetting\" isn't normal. His family not buying presents for his new wife isn't normal. I'm not trying to alarm you, but I'm scared for you. Leave while you still can.", "What about his family? Did they all forget you were coming too? I don\u2019t mean to sound mean here, but growing up in a toxic, emotionally abusive family, my sense of what is \u2018normal\u2019 in a relationship was severely skewed. I used to think that all those flags flying around the guys I liked were good signs, but after many years of therapy I realise they were all red, I just wasn\u2019t able to see that. \n\nYou\u2019re 4 months married. Your husband should be enamoured enough with you that he *wants* to make this a great experience for you. Instead, he not only doesn\u2019t make sure his family has at least one gift for you, he doesn\u2019t even get you anything.  And they all knew. They all saw it happen. Have any of them spoken to you to apologise about this? How has he or anyone else tried to make it up to you? \n\nI think it would be worthwhile for you to take some time and consider if you\u2019ve jumped from the frying pan into the fire with this relationship. Sometimes when we try to escape one abusive situation we can inadvertently land in another. Take some time away from all of this to consider what you really want in a relationship. How do you want to be treated and has he shown he\u2019s capable of that on a consistent basis? If you can\u2019t go home right now, the least your husband can do is get you a few nights in a hotel all to yourself to make it up to you and give you space to think.", "Ask him if he's going to wrap it in Christmas wrapping for you, and then put up some decorations and prepare a special Christmas dinner for you to make this late gift properly festive. Don't let him get off with a few mouse clicks on the Amazon website.", "I apologise that I was rude. \n\nYou are NTA. \n\nHe has treated you incredibly badly and I\u2019m sorry for you. \n\nSeparately, the age gap is not okay - no 15yo should be with a 13yo and his behaviour is that of an abuser now, as it was then.", "Tell him he's just like your father...hopefully that will shake him up.\nTell his mom that if he keeps acting this way, it might be time for an annulment", "NTA and as much as it hurts this is important information. Either you can let him know how deeply, deeply hurt you are, or you can't. And if he isn't the kind of person you can let see you in pain, then that's a significant and painful thing to find out. I don't necessarily think I'd assume he's making the connection (I agree he should, and lots of people would, and he's an idiot if he didn't, but I also think in relationships it's better to err on the side of communicating rather than assuming), but if you don't feel like you can share that you feel devastated and unimportant, that's a huge red flag. You *deserve* what you wanted here. You *deserve* considered and cared for. It hurts because you know you should have gotten better. It's not selfish or greedy to want to be loved, in the ways you've asked, or to be noticed or thought of or cherished. This sucks and if he can't get his head around it, you deserve more.", "Oh, he knew how you grew up?\n\nI'm so sorry, his indifference in light of that is abominable.", "Dude, that's pretty messed up. For his family, that's rude behaviour. I'd flat out ask them what on earth is up with that?\n\nFor your husband though, that's downright disrespectful. There are valid excuses for him not to get you the drawing tablet you wanted, but to get you nothing at all with an excuse of \"I forgot\"? That's ridiculous. Christmas isn't some surprise holiday that you never know when it shows up. And you're his wife for crying out loud.\n\nThere's something seriously, seriously weird here. You may want to have a sit down chat with your husband because this feels fishy as all hell. Almost like his family doesn't expect you to be around much longer.", "Wow that's really bad.  Given your husband's lack of interest in buying you a gift I'd put the blame on him -- I'm sure the other spouses contributed to the gift discussion and told other family members what their spouse wanted for Christmas, making buying easy, while your husband surely didn't take part.", "What do you wanna bet he told his family that you don't get gifts for Christmas (based on the past with your \"parents\"). If it was me, I'd be having a chat with MIL asking if he was always this way in past relationships where he didn't celebrate a birthday or Christmas with a gift for the girl. If she asks what you mean, then tell her how your husband knows you never got Christmas gifts for Christmas from your family and that your husband promised to make it up to you for your shitty parents by saying it'll be the best Christmas ever, but instead it brought back family trauma and you just wondering if he never gave a Christmas or birthday gift to previous girlfriends.", "Wait a sec.  \n\nDid your husband do anything for his family for gifts?  Did he pick the apron?  Wash dishes from the brownies?  Bag candied pecans?  \n\nBecause if he did absolutely nothing for anyone, you have a bigger problem than him not buying you a Christmas present. He bought no one anything and benefits from your labor.", "\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\n\nThat's just sad. I am so, so sorry to hear you're dealing with this.", "13 and 16, I'm going to point out.", "We already agreed once we got engaged that we would start doing annual gifts, hence the gift he gave me last year after he proposed.", "**You're** not being judged. A 15-year-old should not have been \"dating\" a 12-year-old. I'm also curious what this \"dating\" entailed if you had strict parents and could never leave the house. I'm also wondering how you could have had \"lots of breaks\" and dated other people but still say you were together for 7 years.  It seems like you married him to get into a \"normal\" relationship/family, but basically went from the frying pan into the fire, because honey, **none of this is normal** - not your relationship, not his \"forgetting\" your present, not his family welcoming you while simultaneously not even getting you *one* gift - it *screams* abuse, and you just can't hear it because you've gone deaf from all you suffered at your parents' house. Get out, get help, get healed, and *then* you'll find a relationship that is worthy of you.", "My gut tells me he loves the fact that she grew up without gifts, so the bar is LOW. This is a power move.", "Yeah, I was thinking the same thing. He's had a lot of girlfriends in the past, maybe they think I'm only temporary... I dunno. It just hurts, especially since I put so much effort into the homemade gifts I made and I gave a few store bought gifts that I put a lot of thought into. I could understand if money was tight but no, he and his family are very well off. I'm too anxious and scared of confrontation to ask his family what their deal is, which is why I was ranting to my friend. When she took their side I felt betrayed, to be honest. This isn't normal behavior for a family as \"nice\" as them.", "I did try asking, but she didn't really answer me, she just said his past girlfriends never spent Christmas with the extended family like I did.", "Oh no, he bought people gifts. He sent them to his grandma's house and made sure they were all delivered. Sure, some people didn't get gifts from him. But I shouldn't have been one of them", "The fact that you had this agreement seems like very salient information for your original post! Anyway good luck!", "What I meant but said with far more grace, thank you.", "When did he have time to have so many girlfriends?  Unless my math is off you have been dating since you were 13 and he was 16.  You have been together for 6 yrs and are married, his family should be over the temporary thing by now.", "I wonder why. .he never thought about them at Christmas either", "What past girlfriends? If I've read this right, you've been together since you were 13 and 16!? What,  his 8th grade girlfriend didn't come for Christmas?!\nGirl, NTA.", "Growing up...middle school, high school I didn't spend Christmas with my boyfriends families nor they spend with mine. But at some point in the day we got together to exchange a gift.", "But you\u2019re not his girlfriend anymore, you are his wife. So what happened with past girlfriends (if any) isn\u2019t so relevant.", "I am volcanically angry for you. \n\nWas he apologetic about forgetting?  Has he ordered the tablet yet?", "It was off and on. We definitely had gaps where we dated other people", "No, he says he wants to wait until we get to our home state to order it to \"prevent it from being stolen\" if it gets delivered too early.. I'm not sure what to say. I've told him how upset I am but he seems to think I'm overreacting because I still got to spend Christmas with \"family\". It doesn't feel like I'm part of the family", "Good grief you are not overreacting! You pointed out that in one of the past several years you've known him he's given you one Christmas present. You told him what you wanted this Christmas and sent him a link. You gave him a gift and made him a pie and did a ton of things for his family (Who also didn't get you anything which is rude as Hell.). Honey you have set the bar so low for him it's trying to burrow through the floor. My Mom and I give out cookies to the neighbors each Christmas and not only did we include the new neighbors but we got both their dogs a toy.", "Tell him that when they, including him, treat you like proper family at Christmas then, and ONLY then, will you consider yourself to be spending Christmas with \"family.\" Seriously, tell him you expect more than just a drawing tablet after this screw-up. He gets to wrap it and then decorate your home and make a special holiday meal for you - a Christmas do-over, if you will. Maybe next year he'll remember you a better."]}
