His mother is not allowing him to live with her over this. \nHe got a job a few days ago that is 5 minutes driving my where my GF and I live. He doesn't have an operational car, so for a couple of days, we have driven him to and from work.\nWhen he got the job, he asked my GF if I would be willing to let him borrow my car to go back and forth to work. I said absolutely not, I use it for that purpose, I also work third shift.\nHe then asks her if he can stay here until he is able to save money and get an apartment. I say I am not ok with it. I list my reasons, not willing to risk my kids, property, or house, ect, if he chooses to bring drugs into the home. She defends him, saying that he just needs help, I say no. I am not willing to take that risk. I have lived with drug addicts, and my mother was one. No, I am not ok with it.\nI came home yesterday from work to being told that he is asleep in my daughter's bed. I said why, I told you I am not ok with him staying here.

She ignored your concerns, and moved a known drug user into the home you share with your children. That is not something a person who respected you, or cared about your children would do.", "NTA. You\u2019ve experienced drug addicts, you know what that shit brings. Get the fucker outta your house asap.", "Absolutely NTA!! You have very fair and reasonable reasons not let a drug user into a house with children. Also your girlfriend blatantly ignoring you when you tell her you\u2019re not comfortable with him staying there is so not cool. That\u2019s AH behaviour", "NTA X 1000\n Kick him out\n\n What part of \"no\" does your gf not understand", "NTA\n\nShe can go get an apartment and fix him there, on her own dime.  Get him out of the house before he establishes residency and you have to spend months trying to evict him.", "NTA. Your house, your property, your final say. Your nephew is not your monkey and he is not part of your circus. \n\nAnd for anyone tempted to argue \"the girlfriend lives there, too,\" I retort \"so what.\" Unless and until they get married and her name goes on the deed, she doesn't get to tell her boyfriend who can and cannot come into his house.", "NTA. I\u2019ve seen this exact situation play out with a friend of mine\u2019s family. The drug addict would come home at all hours, shit went missing, and he even brought over some shady \u201cfriends\u201d. It\u2019s unfortunate because he definitely needs help, but this doesn\u2019t have to be YOUR responsibility, especially with young impressionable kids in the house.", "Nta.  Go home now.  Remove everything of his from your home.  Put it on the front porch if you have to.  If she can arbitrarily move him in, then you can arbitrarily move him out.  Then have a long discussion about what help you are willing to provide given that she wants to help him and what things are absolute dealbreakers.  I suggest you reflect long and hard about that second point.", "NTA, these are legit and understandable concerns, especially given your personal experience of living with an addict. If he's serious of getting his life back on track there may be shelters available for him to stay while he saves for an apartment and it would be an incentive to stay clean. Best of luck to you", "**NTA**\n\nAnd I am so sorry that she has put you in this position. Your GF sounds woefully naive. While she is right that he needs help, it is not the kind of \"help\" that she is giving him, which is just enabling him. His mother wasn't being an AH kicking him out, she was trying not to enable him in exactly the way your GF is now doing. If he really wanted help he'd ask for assistance going to rehab or meetings or actually addressing his drug problem. But he has not. It sounds like he hasn't even acknowledged to the two of you (nor to himself) that he HAS a problem, even though it's literally why he got thrown out of his home . . . he's just chugging along like it's NBD and trying to find a new place to stay and pretending that everything is fine and normal.\n\nHe should not be around your children because if he is using then he will ABSOLUTELY at some point leave drugs and/or paraphernalia around your house in a place where they can find them, and your kids are still young enough to put unfamiliar things in their mouths. As your GF if her nephew \"needing help\" is a bigger priority to her than having to take a 2-year-old to the ER for an overdose . . . if you even find them in time. \n\nHe should not be around your expensive tools because he WILL take and sell them for drug money. My best friend's brother growing up was an addict. I can't tell you how many valuables he stole from her parents. It broke their hearts, and that was before the actual monetary loss. There is also every possibility that if he is high he will mess with your stuff and leave it where the children can hurt themselves. Ask your GF if she's okay with any of this.\n\nThis is not about you not liking him or not wanting to help him if he were ready for help. But he is NOT ASKING FOR YOUR HELP. He is asking to stay in your home, with you and your young kids, while he continues to live a self-destructive lifestyle. You are NTA, and I wish you luck getting your GF to understand that.", "NTA. Your boundaries were clearly drawn and she deliberately crossed them. Why did she ask you if she was going to let him stay anyway? Although she\u2019s being kind to her nephew she\u2019s definitely in the wrong in regards to you. Hope she understands she\u2019s disrespecting you.", "NTA\n\nYou have two small kids to consider. That your gf went behind your back like she did and thinks she can just stormtroop over your concerns, isn't a good sign for a long lasting relationship.\n\nThere's a different compromise where you can help him get back on his feet without letting him stay, so he can prove that he actually wants to.", "NTA. If his own mother believes he needs tough love and kicked him out then she is likely correct.", "NTA. Rarely do these situations end well. She needs to decide if she is going to prioritize her kids or her nephew. You have already made your decision, and she has completely disregarded you as her partner, her children's father, and the homeowner. You & her need to have a serious talk and get back on the same page, and other arrangements need to be made by nephew.", "NTA\n\nThe safety and comfort of your kids come before helping a random relative.\n\nHis own mother won\u2019t allow him to live in her home. That says a lot about what you would be dealing with if he came into your home.", "NTA.", "NTA. Letting other adults move in is definitely a two yes one no situation. Who owns the house doesn't matter. What matters is that it's your joint *home*, and you don't just invite people to live with you when the other person says no.", "NTA. Let her pay to rent him an apartment. If she's willing to disrespect her partner and risk her relationship for a drug addled nephew, she can certainly pony up a damage deposit. \n\nI'd take whatever steps to have him legally removed. You'd be risking your relationship, but it doesn't sound like you're risking much", "If she is repeatedly going against your very reasonable wishes then she may get more creative in her subterfuge. Cameras my friend and ensure she hasn't handed him a key. NTA", "It\u2019s your house. You get to say no. And you should. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. I'd tell her to move around too. They can get a place together.", "NO NO NO NO NO NO!  NTA \n\nGood for you putting up boundaries to protect your family.  GF is selfishly putting her own need to play hero ahead of her children's safety.", "NTA And ESPECIALLY since you have such young children. It's absolutely NOT worth the risk.", "NTA. Get him out now. She crossed some serious boundaries", "NTA. Put your foot down. Your GF has a white knight complex and is also making crap decisions.", "Nta but she obviously wants to help this kid could you two brainstorm and find some outside help for him. It doesn\u2019t seem like she\u2019s gonna neither if y\u2019all will budge", "NTA. DO NOT LET HIM STAY. My sister pulled this BS with me and it was a nightmare.

I'm sure you love your wife and obviously part of you is feeling a little guilty or you wouldn't be here. Unfortunately, it is not a situation where you can give in though and that is really rough. I don't think this is a \"red flag! Divorce!\" situation but I do sincerely sympathize with your wife, although I don't agree with her. \n\nIn order to preserve your relationship and to respect her feelings, maybe as a small compromise you could give him a bike to have a bit more mobility (since you indicated you are financially stable) or pay for a bus pass so he could get to his job from wherever he is staying more easily. Your wife could also help find him shelters or temporary housing in the area. Obviously you aren't obligated, but it would be a nice gesture.  After that though, I can't see him maintaining contact with your wife being a good idea. If you were to go the monthly bus pass/occasional assistance route you could be his primary contact going forward. I couldn't be this blunt, but someone I know  in a similar situation stated  \"I won't let you die if you're willing to help yourself but that's all I can do\". Best of luck!", "Also, even if they bought the house 50-50, moving someone in is a two-yes-one-no situation.", "The drug addict nephew\u2019s own mother won\u2019t let him in her house, but your gf is letting him stay with you?  Wtf is wrong with her?  NTA.", "Change the locks just in case IMO... Take an inventory of your stuff and install cameras.

But my man, please, for everyone\u2019s sake get him out now!\n\nIt sounds like she might just keep moving him in when you\u2019re not around. Your best option would probably be to take anything valuable and easily movable-jewelry, video game equipment, kids prized possessions, your tools etc and put them in storage or in a trusted friend\u2019s care. You shouldn\u2019t have to do this but your girlfriend has proven she can\u2019t be trusted and you just never know with this guy. There\u2019s not much I can think of for larger items, but those are a lesser concern for the moment since they\u2019re not as easy to move. You could install some cameras like Blink, so you can see who\u2019s coming and going-the only thing is that \u201c someone\u201d might tamper with them. \n\nI\u2019m all for helping people, but this is just too much of a liability-especially with young children around.

But unfortunately, your GF is going to keep letting him back in.\n\nYou need to get the police involved, Press trespassing charges on her Nephew.

Also, there are insane scenarios I've heard of where people like this can basically get some mail at the house and then claim to be a tenant, and it becomes an absolute nightmare.\n\nHe's a drug addict and you have extremely young children.

Get him out now before he gets mail at your address or he will have a viable case for squatters rights.", "NTA your house you decide who\u2019s in it. Shes not your wife and it doesn\u2019t sound like you have been together long enough for common law.", "The total disregard and disrespect you are getting off your gf is ridiculous. So she is prepared to risk her kids home for a druggy. When said druggies mum is not prepared to help him.\n\nKick him to the curb, if your gf wants to house him tell her to move in with him then, but leave the kids, because she risking the kids.\n\nShe shouldn't be risking her kids she should be putting the kids first.\nDoes she want the kids to go in to care.\n\nShe needs to start acting like a bloody parent instead of a family fixer.\n\nYNTA but gf is a massive gigantic AHOLE", "NTA.  Has he been through rehab and is he doing his follow up counseling and 12 step meetings?  If not, job = money = drugs.  He won't be saving up for a rental or a car or anything useful, he'll be using.  Get him out.  NOW.  March down to the basement, yell at him, tell him out now, throw away the bed.  Tell your GF he is not allowed across the threshold for a nap, and meal, a visit, nothing.  Not until he completes rehab.  If she has the personal funds, she can help him out by buying him food, or paying some rent for him.  No one should give an addict money.  Urge her to go to support meeting for loved ones like Al Anon.", "NTA\n\nI empathize a lot with your GF. It's hard to watch an addict do this to themselves, but I've sat through enough Nar-Anon and Al-Anon meetings due to family members who were addicts to know how this sort of situation goes.\n\nHopefully you all can help him (assuming he even wants help), but this isn't the way.", "Honestly even asking for help to get to meetings is sometimes a play. My father-in-law pretended to be going to meetings for months just to get access to my wife and our newborn. I drove that dude back and forth who knows how many times for nothing. I ended up going to a therapist to help figure out this because it was really putting a strain on our new family dynamic. She said if someone has it in them to actually quit they will find a way to get to meetings without your help. If they only go when you take them, they aren't serious enough to succeed.", "I think that the biggest issue is that at some point cops *will* come to the residence and the COS gets involved. Then OP will have to go through the fun games of limbo and jump through hoops to get his kids back.  \n\nKeep drug afflicts out of your house if you have kids.", "Sorry you\u2019re going through this. I definitely understand your girlfriend wanting to help your nephew but I have to wonder if she\u2019s had any experience truly dealing with someone addicted to substances. It\u2019s not ok for her to disregard your wishes, especially given your own history with drug users. If she wants to help her nephew then she needs to find ways that don\u2019t include bringing him to your home, on her own dime. I\u2019ve dealt with family with these issues before and as much as I\u2019ve wanted them to be better, it\u2019s difficult to trust that they really are on the right path. Your girlfriend should respect your wishes. Technically it\u2019s your home and although I\u2019m sure normally her input would be welcome (I hope), in this situation she needs to respect your wishes, or she can leave and get her own place and let her nephew stay with her as long as she likes. And really, is his mom really a POS or did she just get tired of her son\u2019s BS? NTA", "NTA but you need to understand that your gf hasn't had your direct experience and has no real idea of how bad it can get.\n\nYou need to sit down with her and explain the circumstances in your own life which made you make this decision; that it's not coming from some arbitrary place. Hopefully she will see the scope of what she's asking of you, and realise she needs to protect her own children.\n\nBut, in the end, you have a right to decide who lives with you, and she needs to realise that.", "NTA. When it comes to junkies, No good deed goes unpunished.", "Nta, if she wants to help him then she should pay for him to stay someplace.", "NTA", "INFO: how old is the nephew? also is he currently on drugs or in recovery?", "NTA. If she wants to help him so bad, then she gets a job and pays for all his expenses to live somewhere else. She doesn't get to decide that you are covering his expenses without your consent. That's literally theft. Kick him out, don't look back.", "NTA.  When someone's own mother won't let him live with her it's a good hint to you not to take him in.", "NTA. You need to get him out. If he stays, he will have rights and you would have to evict him.", "Nta", "Absolutely not. Kick out both her and the nephew. NTA", "NTA Why is your girlfriend putting her shitty cousin over you? She knows you grew up with an addict which must have been horrific and despite you refusing to have him in the house she sneaks him in behind her back and asks him to stay?", "NTA. You don\u2019t have a nephew problem, you have a girlfriend problem.", "NTA your own kids should come first his own mother doesn't trust him in her house", "Give him a chance.. just one..", "More like it's two yeses for a \"can\" and one no for a \"cannot\". She does have a right to decide that she *doesn't* want to live with someone, as much as he does.\n\nThe difference would be that if he doesn't agree with her \"no\", she's the one who would have to leave.\n\nLiving somewhere without owning the property doesn't mean you have *no* rights, and even more so, when the reason you're living with someone is because you're in a relationship with them, there are certain privileges one expects to share because it's a special circumstance, not a tenancy.\n\nThat being said, all of that is based on a mutual respect, and love, and that is not being shown here. Neither of them should be *forcing* the other to just live with someone else.", "Makes me wonder why they didn\u2019t tie the knot even with 2 kids.. now I know why"]}
