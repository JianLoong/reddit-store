I own the house we live in, I bought it before we got together. We have two young children together, 2 and 5. I have a lot of different hobbies and a lot of different expensive tools as I am remodeling the house. Think, if I don't have the tool, and it will make it easier, I buy the tool.\nShe has a nephew who has had issues with drugs for a couple of years. His mother is not allowing him to live with her over this. \nHe got a job a few days ago that is 5 minutes driving my where my GF and I live. He doesn't have an operational car, so for a couple of days, we have driven him to and from work.\nWhen he got the job, he asked my GF if I would be willing to let him borrow my car to go back and forth to work. I said absolutely not, I use it for that purpose, I also work third shift.\nHe then asks her if he can stay here until he is able to save money and get an apartment. I say I am not ok with it. I list my reasons, not willing to risk my kids, property, or house, ect, if he chooses to bring drugs into the home. She defends him, saying that he just needs help, I say no. I am not willing to take that risk. I have lived with drug addicts, and my mother was one. No, I am not ok with it.\nI came home yesterday from work to being told that he is asleep in my daughter's bed. I said why, I told you I am not ok with him staying here. Her, he called me at 6 am saying he was just wondering the city, so I went and got him. \nThis morning, she calls me on the way to drop one of our kids off at school and says he's in the basement. He helped her more a spare bed into one of the rooms.\nI start yelling, but not entirely unglued, and reiterate everything I have said about the situation over the past 3 days.

She ignored your concerns, and moved a known drug user into the home you share with your children. That is not something a person who respected you, or cared about your children would do.", "NTA. You\u2019ve experienced drug addicts, you know what that shit brings. Get the fucker outta your house asap.", "Absolutely NTA!! You have very fair and reasonable reasons not let a drug user into a house with children. Also your girlfriend blatantly ignoring you when you tell her you\u2019re not comfortable with him staying there is so not cool. That\u2019s AH behaviour", "NTA X 1000\n Kick him out\n\n What part of \"no\" does your gf not understand", "NTA\n\nShe can go get an apartment and fix him there, on her own dime.  Get him out of the house before he establishes residency and you have to spend months trying to evict him.", "NTA. Your house, your property, your final say. Your nephew is not your monkey and he is not part of your circus. \n\nAnd for anyone tempted to argue \"the girlfriend lives there, too,\" I retort \"so what.\" Unless and until they get married and her name goes on the deed, she doesn't get to tell her boyfriend who can and cannot come into his house.", "NTA. I\u2019ve seen this exact situation play out with a friend of mine\u2019s family. The drug addict would come home at all hours, shit went missing, and he even brought over some shady \u201cfriends\u201d. It\u2019s unfortunate because he definitely needs help, but this doesn\u2019t have to be YOUR responsibility, especially with young impressionable kids in the house.", "Nta.  Go home now.  Remove everything of his from your home.  Put it on the front porch if you have to.  If she can arbitrarily move him in, then you can arbitrarily move him out.  Then have a long discussion about what help you are willing to provide given that she wants to help him and what things are absolute dealbreakers.  I suggest you reflect long and hard about that second point.", "NTA, these are legit and understandable concerns, especially given your personal experience of living with an addict. If he's serious of getting his life back on track there may be shelters available for him to stay while he saves for an apartment and it would be an incentive to stay clean. Best of luck to you", "**NTA**\n\nAnd I am so sorry that she has put you in this position. Your GF sounds woefully naive. While she is right that he needs help, it is not the kind of \"help\" that she is giving him, which is just enabling him. His mother wasn't being an AH kicking him out, she was trying not to enable him in exactly the way your GF is now doing. If he really wanted help he'd ask for assistance going to rehab or meetings or actually addressing his drug problem. But he has not. It sounds like he hasn't even acknowledged to the two of you (nor to himself) that he HAS a problem, even though it's literally why he got thrown out of his home . . . he's just chugging along like it's NBD and trying to find a new place to stay and pretending that everything is fine and normal.\n\nHe should not be around your children because if he is using then he will ABSOLUTELY at some point leave drugs and/or paraphernalia around your house in a place where they can find them, and your kids are still young enough to put unfamiliar things in their mouths. As your GF if her nephew \"needing help\" is a bigger priority to her than having to take a 2-year-old to the ER for an overdose . . . if you even find them in time. \n\nHe should not be around your expensive tools because he WILL take and sell them for drug money. My best friend's brother growing up was an addict. I can't tell you how many valuables he stole from her parents. It broke their hearts, and that was before the actual monetary loss. There is also every possibility that if he is high he will mess with your stuff and leave it where the children can hurt themselves. Ask your GF if she's okay with any of this.\n\nThis is not about you not liking him or not wanting to help him if he were ready for help. But he is NOT ASKING FOR YOUR HELP. He is asking to stay in your home, with you and your young kids, while he continues to live a self-destructive lifestyle. You are NTA, and I wish you luck getting your GF to understand that.", "NTA. Your boundaries were clearly drawn and she deliberately crossed them. Why did she ask you if she was going to let him stay anyway? Although she\u2019s being kind to her nephew she\u2019s definitely in the wrong in regards to you. Hope she understands she\u2019s disrespecting you.", "NTA\n\nYou have two small kids to consider. That your gf went behind your back like she did and thinks she can just stormtroop over your concerns, isn't a good sign for a long lasting relationship.\n\nThere's a different compromise where you can help him get back on his feet without letting him stay, so he can prove that he actually wants to.", "NTA. If his own mother believes he needs tough love and kicked him out then she is likely correct.", "NTA. Rarely do these situations end well. She needs to decide if she is going to prioritize her kids or her nephew. You have already made your decision, and she has completely disregarded you as her partner, her children's father, and the homeowner. You & her need to have a serious talk and get back on the same page, and other arrangements need to be made by nephew.", "NTA\n\nThe safety and comfort of your kids come before helping a random relative.\n\nHis own mother won\u2019t allow him to live in her home. That says a lot about what you would be dealing with if he came into your home.", "NTA.", "NTA. Letting other adults move in is definitely a two yes one no situation. Who owns the house doesn't matter. What matters is that it's your joint *home*, and you don't just invite people to live with you when the other person says no.", "NTA. Let her pay to rent him an apartment. If she's willing to disrespect her partner and risk her relationship for a drug addled nephew, she can certainly pony up a damage deposit. \n\nI'd take whatever steps to have him legally removed. You'd be risking your relationship, but it doesn't sound like you're risking much", "If she is repeatedly going against your very reasonable wishes then she may get more creative in her subterfuge. Cameras my friend and ensure she hasn't handed him a key. NTA", "It\u2019s your house. You get to say no. And you should. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. I'd tell her to move around too. They can get a place together.", "NO NO NO NO NO NO!  NTA \n\nGood for you putting up boundaries to protect your family.  GF is selfishly putting her own need to play hero ahead of her children's safety.", "NTA And ESPECIALLY since you have such young children. It's absolutely NOT worth the risk.", "NTA. Get him out now. She crossed some serious boundaries", "NTA. Put your foot down. Your GF has a white knight complex and is also making crap decisions.", "Nta but she obviously wants to help this kid could you two brainstorm and find some outside help for him. It doesn\u2019t seem like she\u2019s gonna neither if y\u2019all will budge", "NTA. DO NOT LET HIM STAY. My sister pulled this BS with me and it was a nightmare.

I'm sure you love your wife and obviously part of you is feeling a little guilty or you wouldn't be here. Unfortunately, it is not a situation where you can give in though and that is really rough. I don't think this is a \"red flag! Divorce!\" situation but I do sincerely sympathize with your wife, although I don't agree with her. \n\nIn order to preserve your relationship and to respect her feelings, maybe as a small compromise you could give him a bike to have a bit more mobility (since you indicated you are financially stable) or pay for a bus pass so he could get to his job from wherever he is staying more easily. Your wife could also help find him shelters or temporary housing in the area. Obviously you aren't obligated, but it would be a nice gesture.  After that though, I can't see him maintaining contact with your wife being a good idea. If you were to go the monthly bus pass/occasional assistance route you could be his primary contact going forward. I couldn't be this blunt, but someone I know  in a similar situation stated  \"I won't let you die if you're willing to help yourself but that's all I can do\".
