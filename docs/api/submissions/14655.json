I\u2019ve lived here for 5 years (with my ex who recently moved out). Last year my neighbors (31F, 30sM) moved in downstairs after the unit had been empty for a while. They were good neighbors until this year when they had a baby. Apparently they had to go through ivf and had a bunch of miscarriages, she posted all about it on Facebook. I thought that was TMI but whatever. I\u2019m only her Facebook friend because she added me. She\u2019s made a big deal about being pregnant and it\u2019s been annoying to see but I just ignored her.\n\nAnyway since she\u2019s had the baby I\u2019ve had to deal with the crying from downstairs. It\u2019s not as bad as I expected but it still is really annoying. I\u2019ve gone down and knocked on their door a couple of times to tell them to keep the noise down. Every time they apologize and blame their baby but nothing has changed. I got fed up and reported them to our landlord for making too much noise. The landlord talked to my neighbors who are now turning it around on me, saying my dogs are too loud and I play music at night that wakes their baby up. My dogs aren\u2019t that loud and hardly ever bark when I\u2019m home. I got annoyed and went down to talk to my neighbor about it and she got really nasty with me, and blamed me and my dogs for \u201calways\u201d waking up her baby.\n\nShe said they can hear every one of mine and my dogs footsteps and the dogs nails on the floor specifically, that my dogs bark the whole time I\u2019m not home during the day, and that I put my music up too loud at night. I told her I can\u2019t make my dogs not bark when I\u2019m out, and that they\u2019re dogs on hardwood floors and that I didn\u2019t know what she expected living in a downstairs unit. I also told her I\u2019m allowed to have people over and my music on whenever I want in my home. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to ask me to change my life when I\u2019m not the one who had a baby.\n\nMy neighbor got an attitude and told me she was only asking for me to be \u201crespectful of our shared space\u201d and brought up hearing an argument I had with my ex a few weeks ago. I admit it was a little loud but it wasn\u2019t that big of a deal. I laughed and told her that pretty much went out the window when she had a baby but she shut the door in my face. I reported the whole conversation to my landlord so there\u2019s a record of my complaints because I want them and that baby out of here! When I was telling a friend about what was happening she told me I was being a major asshole to \u201cstruggling new parents\u201d but I think that\u2019s their problem and not mine. But I wanted to get some unbiased feedback because that friend is usually a little overemotional for my taste.", "created_utc": 1681330471, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12jxjty/aita_for_reporting_my_neighbors_crying_baby_to/", "score": 306, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Yet all the noise coming from her apartment absolutely needs to be addressed?\n\nYour dogs bark all day, her baby cries. Cancels each other out. You\u2019re playing music late at night, which is also causing the baby to wake up, which causes the rest of the household to wake up, and the baby cries once again. \n\nI just love how you tell her, \u201cI can\u2019t make my dogs not bark,\u201d yet you think she should magically be able to make her baby stop crying?\n\nWhat\u2019s ironic is you send this whole conversation over to your landlord, which holds a laundry list of her complaints with you, when you only have one complaint about them. I wouldn\u2019t surprised if you ended up being the one to be written up. \n\nNoise levels at night, consistent noise from your dogs throughout the day, and a domestic dispute. Now we can add harassment toward the neighbor.

Make it make sense! YTA.", "Oh my God your a major AH! You say you can\u2019t control your dogs but you blame them for not being able to control their baby? This is ridiculous! Newborns cry, it\u2019s the only way the can communicate.

No, my friend, YTA and you deserve to her evicted for your utterly unreasonable behaviour and unacceptable expectations.", "YTA.

You let your dogs bark when you're not there and want her to quiet her baby?  Then shut  the dogs up.", "Wow, YTA. Babies cry. It's what they do. Some babies have colic which means they basically NEVER STOP CRYING. I promise you that your neighbor finds the crying far more frustrating than you do.

You can wear ear plugs. A baby can't. Get over yourself.", "YTA. You can't just make a baby stop crying. You can make dogs stop barking.

What exactly do you want them to do with a newborn that is crying? Put a pillow over it\u2019s face? You can\u2019t control what your dogs do so how could they control their baby? It\u2019s a baby\u2019s ONLY means of communication and sometimes what they are crying for is not something that can be fixed with an instant move. Sometimes they cry. Good grief I hope your landlord laughs you out of that building. You want all the grace for your music, your dogs, and your arguments, but God forbid a baby cries and THEY need to move out?", "YTA. You can\u2019t make your dogs stop barking but you think they can make a baby stop crying. Ffs\n\nBabies cry. Deal with it.", "YTA. WTF do you think your landlord can do?", "YTA and you know it.

Were hell. I used to have to get my mum to come hold my baby just so I could have a shower because I couldn\u2019t put them down or they\u2019d scream until they made themselves sick. And they would cry at everything, if I walked away, if I held them wrong, if I talked too loud, if they couldn\u2019t hear me. It was horrible. And there was nothing I could do about it. It\u2019s just not feasible to hold a baby for 24 hours straight. I needed to shower and pee and all the rest.\n\n\nI\u2019ve not had someone complain to me about my baby\u2019s, but we are pretty good neighbours here, they have dogs that bark, they have parties (but are still considerate of my kids) we have kids running up and down the street playing, music playing most days from houses. Because that\u2019s what good neighbours do. \n\n\nYou sounds exhausting, especially considering you have dogs barking and music and those are things you can control, you can\u2019t tell a baby to be quiet, doesn\u2019t work like that.", "YTA x 10000000000", "Dude, you are a total AH.

YTA.", "YTA what makes you think she can control her babies crying anymore than you can control your dogs walking around on hardwood. You can turn down your music and she can't turn down her baby. She's right she was observing the idea that in a  shared space you have to deal with other people's noise. You were lucky she was letting your noise go but you opened the door for her to complain. You know you can muzzle your dogs but she can't muzzle a baby. I think when it comes down to it you'll lose if the landlord has to kick someone out.", "YTA", "YTA\n\nSeems like you're crying more than the baby.", "YTA, you have loud dogs and want to complain about a baby.

But as someone in an apartment, you also want to impose your way of life on your neighbors. You cannot control the actions of other people. They had a baby. Babies cry (I think pretty much every person has told you this at this point). \n\nSimple solution: move out into your own house. Better yet, buy a house with a couple acres. I promise you'll never be bothered by babies crying again. \n\nIf you don't want to move out because 1. It costs too much 2. The location needs to be close enough to your place of employment 3. You want to be close to family (idk...you don't strike me as a family person, but I digress) 4. -insert reason here-...well your neighbors with the crying baby also have the same reasons you do. Duplexes are literally a complex of people living together from various walks of life and various lifestyles. If you don't want to live around crying babies, then move tf out to a place where no babies can be! \n\nStop thinking the world revolves around you and your lifestyle. It doesn't. Either put up, shut up, or move out. Because you are not the princess you think you are. \n\nYou are not the main character. You think you are, but you're probably some npc that gives an annoying side quest in this world. \n\nIn case you haven't gotten it by now....you are one of the biggest, most entitled AHs I have seen on this subreddit.

YTA", "I would start lodging noise complaints about the dogs and the music.", "YTA\n\nI'm not a fan of babies and I'm child free. Your complaints about the baby are irrational and uppity. Babies cry. If it cries during quiet hours wear headphones to listen to your music or TV. Wear earplugs at night. If it's disrupting your sleep... And your dogs are your problem and most likely making far more noise than you realize between barking when you're gone and walking on hard wood floors. Clip their nails and take them for walks.\n\nI've only complained about a neighbor three times - a dog that barked for 2 hours solid, a neighbor who decided to push their way into my place, and that same neighbor who decided to bang on their wall with a hammer at 3 am for extended periods multiple days in a row. The baby crying is not at any of those levels.", "Massive, MASSIVE YTA.

I\u2019ve lived here for 5 years (with my ex who recently moved out). Last year my neighbors (31F, 30sM) moved in downstairs after the unit had been empty for a while. They were good neighbors until this year when they had a baby. Apparently they had to go through ivf and had a bunch of miscarriages, she posted all about it on Facebook. I thought that was TMI but whatever. I\u2019m only her Facebook friend because she added me. She\u2019s made a big deal about being pregnant and it\u2019s been annoying to see but I just ignored her. Anyway since she\u2019s had the baby I\u2019ve had to deal with the crying from downstairs. It\u2019s not as bad as I expected but it still is really annoying. I\u2019ve gone down and knocked on their door a couple of times to tell them to keep the noise down. Every time they apologize and blame their baby but nothing has changed. I got fed up and reported them to our landlord for making too much noise. The landlord talked to my neighbors who are now turning it around on me, saying my dogs are too loud and I play music at night that wakes their baby up. My dogs aren\u2019t that loud and hardly ever bark when I\u2019m home. I got annoyed and went down to talk to my neighbor about it and she got really nasty with me, and blamed me and my dogs for \u201calways\u201d waking up her baby. She said they can hear every one of mine and my dogs footsteps and the dogs nails on the floor specifically, that my dogs bark the whole time I\u2019m not home during the day, and that I put my music up too loud at night. I told her I can\u2019t make my dogs not bark when I\u2019m out, and that they\u2019re dogs on hardwood floors and that I didn\u2019t know what she expected living in a downstairs unit. I also told her I\u2019m allowed to have people over and my music on whenever I want in my home. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to ask me to change my life when I\u2019m not the one who had a baby. My neighbor got an attitude and told me she was only asking for me to be \u201crespectful of our shared space\u201d and brought up hearing an argument I had with my ex a few weeks ago.
