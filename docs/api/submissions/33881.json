Invites like this should **always** be run by the other members of the household before they are offered to the guests. It's just polite. The fact that your BF didn't run it by you says that he either doesn't value your opinion, just expect you to go along with what he says, or just plain doesn't consider you when making decisions.\n\nConsidering what your BF said when you confronted him, I'm starting to suspect the latter.\n\nBut, partially what this comes down to is being an extrovert vs. being an introvert - where you get your energy from. Your BF obviously gets his energy from being around people, whereas you don't. It is possible for extroverts and introverts to be in relationships together, but it involves both sides being willing to understand the need of the other, and, whereas you were willing to put up with your BF's needs for four days, he has been unwilling to consider your needs for a single day. \n\nAnd this is typical of the world in general - it's an extrovert's world, and introverts are considered weird and antisocial, we are expected to either live with it or \"fix\" ourselves, which is BS. Your need to be alone in a house you live in and help to maintain just as much as he does is just as valid as his need to be with people.", "NTA\u2026and just tell him, sorry, nope.   I need quiet, down time to relax now.  This is my home too and I get a say.  I get that you still want to socialize. So you can go there.", "NTA It\u2019s your home as much as his and whilst he shouldn\u2019t need your permission to have company it\u2019s common courtesy to check you are OK with it", "NTA\n\nYour request to be consulted was not out of line but your BF's comment makes him TA.", "NTA - he should ask you before he does thing as you live there too. I dont think this needs to be a huge conflict but you definitely need to to address this with him.", "Bro he hates you", "Uhhhhh, wtf.   \n\n\nNTA. I mean your boyfriend should ABSOLUTELY be running things like this by you, having his parents stay an extra day? And then when they couldn't, pivoting and inviting friends over? Why?\n\nI don't have the context to know his tone or intent when he said \"clearly I don't want to be alone with you\" but also very much not a cool thing to say to your partner.", "NTA...healthy couples communicate before making these kinds of decisions. If my SO said they didn't want to be alone with me, I'd ve inclined to make their wish come true.", "From what you've written, NTA, but I feel like some context is missing.\n\nWere you being snippy because of your low social meter? Did you mention to him after his parents declined that you wanted to spend the day alone with him? His comment about not wanting to be alone with you just seems to be coming in from way out of the left field. Why does he not want to be alone with you?\n\nNone of this is likely to change my ruling unless something extreme comes up, but it's throwing me off.\n\nHe absolutely should be talking to you about this stuff in advance and not just springing them on you. That's part of cohabitation, whether it's talking to roommates or a SO.", "NTA and you need to get a new BF. He doesn't care about you and doesn't want to be alone with you.

It seems to me that he\u2019s trying to extend the holiday because there\u2019s a conflict coming up. Him saying he doesn\u2019t want to be alone with you without an indication of the tone or context suggests to me that you might have indicated to him on more than one occasion that you\u2019re not happy with how much effort it\u2019s taking to host his parents. I\u2019m not saying he\u2019s right to be irritated or angry. It seems to me that quite a few people seem to think their version of normal is what others must adapt to. When those who don\u2019t simply accept and go along with their normal, the people demanding acquiescence get frustrated because why would anyone have a problem with \u201cnormal?\u201d", "NTA, why would you be?", "Well your bf told you why, he doesn't want to be alone with you.

Your bf told you plainly that 'clearly, I don't want to be alone with you.' Now, maybe he said that in the heat of the moment in frustration because of maybe him being irked by some behaviors you might have displayed during the visit or maybe the lack of good sleep. But people have a tendency to say what they really feel at the most awkward of times. \n\nMaybe it's just come to the point for him that the two of you have lifestyles/personalities that are too divergent to overcome. But whatever the problem is, it's definitely a problem, and a very big one. I think you need to have a clear and definitive conversation with your bf about your mutual satisfaction levels in this relationship and rethink whether you feel accepted, valued, and cherished.\n\nNo judgement.", "Or this is one of his mental breakdown episode if OP already knows about his mental issues.
