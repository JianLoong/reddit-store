During this time, he admitted he was struggling with English books but didn't want to tell my brother. I can understand that since I did grow up feeling overshadowed by my older brother's academic brilliance(he got 100% in several tests)  so I told my nephew that it's okay he struggles with something, and that as long as he is reading it's a good thing. That he doesn't have to be the perfect straight A\\*s student that his dad was, and to just try his best.\n\nI also bought him a couple of the books he already had, but translated versions instead, so he can enjoy them more in our language.\n\nBut when my brother returned, he wasn't happy about it. He frowned when he saw the translated books and accused me of allowing his son to get lazy and that the books were written for kids his age. I asked him 'Are you serious right now?'

Keep supporting the kid, looks like he can use a buddy.", "NTA. If the kid only has a chance to read a book in a foreign language and struggle, they aren\u2019t going to enjoy reading.

Dad is too strict and unreasonable.", "NTA I don\u2019t have a full grasp on it because I only speak english, but I know that attempting to learn a language is extremely difficult, at least it is for me. Your brother is pushing him too hard for academics and will create a perfectionist who doubts himself about everything if he continues with this method of pushing him. I would assume having the books in both languages would help him to cross reference and learn to read one through reading the other, it may be a good method for him.", "NTA but you brother is.

The fact that your brother does not understand that people need different approaches when it comes to learning is very sad. Translated books are a great method to learn a language.\n\nActually, you can find books that are directly translated, as in on the left page you have the text in English and on the right page in Spanish, for example. There are also different levels of difficulty , depending on how advanced the reader is. This is a very good tool.\n\nBack on topic, your brother should be glad that you're involved in your nephew's life and that you care enough to spend time and money on his education. His reaction is very alarming, and also the fact that your nephew seems to be scared to speak about his struggles with his father. There really needs to be a proper sit down with the nephew and his parents in order to clear this up, as it could be just the tip of the iceberg. Who knows what else might be going on behind doors?", "NTA simultaneously reading text in two languages is a good way to learn vocabulary. It's used for kids developing english as a second language in the UK.", "NTA\n\nYour brother failed his kid and is unable to see his failure.\n\nAre you serious was at the surprise of his thick headed stupidity. Tell your SiL to stop taking sides and see to her kid properly, not just push him to be perfect.", "NTA. I had parents like that growing up. I would have loved help like you gave your nephew.", "I\u2019ll tell him that the kid needs to enjoy reading in order to improve.", "Sorry; she\u2019s my sister-in-law: my mistake for typing quickly and not checking.", "100%! If you don\u2019t enjoy it, what\u2019s the motivation? Poor guy. Thank you for looking out for him!", "ah ok, still pretty fucked up to go on a month long cruise without their child", "Your brother is going to give his son so many self-esteem issues and anxiety if he hasn't already. NTA", "NTA - You asked \"Was she right?\"\n\nNo.  Saying \"are you serious right now?\" is not passive aggressive.  It was regular aggressive.  Passive aggression would have been if you had said \"whatever, *sigh* MY opinions don't matter\" and then stomped off.", "It\u2019s an excellent tool. English is the weirdest language, and all of its rules make it harder to learn for non-native speakers. I\u2019m a native speaker, and I\u2019ve found that other languages have fewer weird rules that don\u2019t really make sense. \n\nAn ESL student gets the benefit of those weird rules about spelling, grammar, and other stuff being built into the English translation.", "He\u2019s probably also that type of parent that moves the goalposts. Like\u2026 if you come home with a 95% average in something, he\u2019ll ask \u201cwhere\u2019s the other 5%?\u201d My dad was like this. Even as a little kid I knew that was unreasonable, and I absolutely refused to let him put that pressure on me. I saw that him having that standard was hypocritical (severely dysfunctional people don\u2019t get to tell anyone to be perfect).", "Having both copies will also do nothing but help him. He can read it in your language and understand the story, then go back and read it in English to practice with a story he's already familiar with.", "My daughter is threelingual.   \nI'm buying her books in all 3 languages.   \nReading is reading."]}
