How depressing that your husband SAID he\u2019d watch his child, failed, blamed YOU, and you still feel that you have to ask if you\u2019re at fault. **NO!** You should not have apologized to him, and if I were you I\u2019d take it back. You did nothing wrong, he is the one who failed to stick to his word.\n\n2. You\u2019re not the AH for freaking out either, you lost your four year old! On a farm, no less! What mother wouldn\u2019t freak out about that? He could\u2019ve gotten seriously hurt, that\u2019s likely why your husband was so quick to try and shift the blame onto you, because he *knew* if something bad had happened, it\u2019d be completely on him. \n\nWhat do you have to be sorry for? For believing your husband? For having a normal motherly reaction to your child being unsupervised in an unknown location? For making him feel insecure because you were working too and managed not to drop the ball? Do not let your husband, or anyone, try to make you feel ashamed for having reasonable expectations or emotions. He owes you a massive apology, for losing your son, for blaming you, for making you believe there\u2019s any possibility you should be blamed.", "NTA. He phoned you to say the kid was missing so he obviously knew he was meant to be the one who was keeping an eye. He's being an asshole for projecting his guilt onto you.", "Am I missing something? He agreed to watch the kid. He had one job. NTA", ">but me and my daughter both heard him agree to watch him\n\n**NTA** OP, unless he came back inside to drop your son back off with you, you had no indication he was going to just start working on something that would wholly take his attention away from your son.\n\nHe's mad because he knows he screwed up.", "Our three year old got away from us once on our farm. We were both working on a fence and the kid was surrounded by outside toys and was getting dirty and having fun with trucks. We were all three together. Then, our son was just gone. I still don\u2019t know how it happened. We only knew two things. One direction led to a highway and the other to our three ponds. Neither was comforting. We were terrified. We yelled- for him, at each other. I sobbed. Husband ran toward the water and I to the traffic. The whole thing ended in about five minutes and our son was found safe. \n\nAll that to get to my point. I have never been so scared in my entire life. Ever. Give yourselves some grace here. The kid is okay. Just never forget how quickly something horrifying can change your life permanently. Hug each other and move on.", "NTA Husband does something wrong and it's wife's fault? * sigh *", "NTA for being upset with your husband! If he agreed to watch 4m, then he should have been paying attention to him!", "NTA.  Come on dad.  You are lying in front of multiple witnesses.  Really?  When you are in a hole, stop digging.", "NTA - he said he would watch your son, so should have been watching him. He then tried to blame you for 'leaving' your son with him - but, you hadn't, he had taken him with him. He is the AH for not watching your son and then for trying to blame you.", "NTA. He said he would watch him. Also, if something changed and he knew he couldn\u2019t keep an eye on him, then he should have let you know BEFORE losing him that he needed you to take over again. I\u2019m not sure how this could possibly be your fault.", "NTA, that was super irresponsible of him", "NTA\n\nHe agreed to keep an eye on him. Both of you were really stressed searching for him, so it's normal that you yelled at each other after that. If he was going to be really busy, he should have tell you to watch your son! \n\nAnyways, be careful with  that in the future", "NTA - If you sent your son out there without your husband's knowledge and he didn't keep tabs on him that'd be one thing, but if he said he'd watch him and then loses track that's on him .", "You\u2019re NTA for being angry at him for losing your son, but you are TA for including your daughter in your argument. Children should never be a part of their parents argument.", "You've two spares. You won't miss one.", "NTA - I have a farm and a toddler. I am sorry that your husband was negligent  while he was supposed to be supervising your son. It can be a herculean effort to watch a young child and complete tasks on the farm. Your husband is very lucky. This could have ended in tragedy, and if I were you, I would be furious. You have every right to be. Your husband is being dismissive because he knew it was wrong. And most likely, upon further reflection, he realized how much danger your son could have been in.\n\n Your husband should not have agreed to watch your son, if he knew he wouldn't be able to stop briefly and scan the work area with enough frequency for your son to not wander away. I'm glad this has a happy ending - that your son was found quickly and unharmed. But I would be having a serious conversation with your husband about realistic expectations while he is working on projects. If your husband cannot stop what he is doing to confirm that your son is in his line of sight, then your son should stay inside with you or a responsible older sibling. Though, I realize that is not always an option. Hopefully this scare will wake him up. I know it made my blood pressure rise!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Yes, he agreed to it and he absolutely should have paid more attention. However, once your son was found safe, it should ideally have been a discussion, not a freak out.\n\nAt least, that's how my wife and I strive to handle things. Yelling and freaking out on each other never really brings anyone any satisfaction. He likely got instantly defensive as evidenced by his trying to blame you.

Maybe start with something as simple as making sure you're each looking one another in the eyes when you confirm who's taking which child for what purpose.\n\nIt's something I've noticed with both myself and my wife now that we're nearly 28 years into our marriage. If we're not actively listening, we'll sometimes just assume what the other is saying because a good portion of our lives is \"routine\". We found that making sure we're actually looking at one another when we confirm something helps.\n\nHeck, I just did this the other day. I just started a new job a couple weeks ago and am mentally overwhelmed with new training. We were running errands after dinner and I asked to confirm something I had \"just thought of\". Except she had already talked to me about it earlier that day and since I hadn't interrupted my training to focus on her, it went in one ear and out the other.
