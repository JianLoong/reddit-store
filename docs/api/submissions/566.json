She first moved into the master 1.5 months ago and currently only sleeps and has clothing in there, her old bedroom is still full of her belongings.\n\nI asked her to move asap but she's not. The main hurry is because she wakes at 5am for work approx once per week, it takes her over an hour to get ready, and the living space is a small combined kitchen/dining/living so we\u2019re within a meter the whole time. Dealing with this every week for 4 months, along with having no privacy/space, her not respecting my boundaries because it\u2019s a \u201ccommon living space\u201d, and trying to manage severe mental health issues (highly influenced by this living situation), all while knowing there\u2019s a bedroom I could have been sleeping in for the last month has been extremely upsetting. We also split the rent 50/50, she has two bedrooms and I have none.\n\nIn her waking up early for work, or getting up early for other commitments, she either immediately turns on the lights or opens the blinds when she enters the space. This constant extreme sudden wake up is horrible. I have asked her many times to verbally warn me before she does either of those things so I can block out the light, but she has never tried. This is the reason for my frustrations, she has no concern for the impact it has on me.\n\nYesterday she got up once during the night turning on the main light, and in the morning she got up to make breakfast and opened the blinds, agin with no warning. I expressed my frustrations in waking up to like this all the time but she has no empathy for the situation. Her main argument is that it\u2019s not her fault I\u2019m in the main living space, my main argument is that it\u2019s neither of our faults but if she moved out of her old room, we wouldn\u2019t be having this current argument, however, all I have been asking is for a heads up about the light or noise in the mornings so I can wake up calmer.\n\nThis morning I forgot to turn off one of my alarms. I dealt with it asap but she harshly yelled out to turn it off. A moment later I opened her door to let her cat in and as she was awake, I briefly explained that the frustration she felt a minute ago is how I feel when she wakes me up most mornings. She was visibly angry and shouted during this encounter. Whenever I get upset or frustrated, she dismisses it and doesn\u2019t care, but when she is woken, she gets extremely angry and yells. There are double standards.\n\nI found myself in a situation I could use this morning to make this point, and figured maybe she would empathise if she could relate her situation to mine. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1667176843, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yhvrmz/aita_for_waking_my_best_friend_up_at_8am/", "score": 5, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She letting you sleep on the couch so she can have a walk in wardrobe. If she's not willing to move her stuff you should move out.", "NTA. But I'm sorry, how is this a friend again? There are two bedrooms and she took over BOTH of them? Normal people do not do that. Find a real friend for a roommate.", "NTA\n\nObviously you need a room. If it doesn\u2019t happen when it should you may want to put it in writing. \nAlso, I can\u2019t stand someone yelling at me in my home. It happens sometimes but it should be really rare. It should be a safe, and private place for you. I would probably just pile her stuff outside the door and move in to the bedroom.", "I was expecting to read that you purposely barged into your friend/roommate's room at 8am to wake her up for spite/revenge. But it was only an ACCIDENT because she heard the alarm you forgot to turn off. NTA. Your \"friend\" sure is one though. Both for opening curtains/turning on lights after you've requested a warning, and for taking so long to make a bedroom available to you. \n\nShe needs a deadline to have all her stuff in one bedroom or the other, and she needs to agree that if she doesn't meet that deadline, you can do it for her by moving all her stuff back into her original bedroom (presumably with help, if you can get help).", "INFO - who owns this house?\n\n\n>My bedroom has been affected by a water leak ...for the last 4 months.\n\nThis is not ok.

If she isn't paying extra for it why would you? Also she needs a firm deadline of a week to get her stuff into 1 bedroom. Even if that makes it cluttered and she doesn't have time to sort. I'd also have morning alarms go off just before hers do until she stops the light nonsense while you are in the living room.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If you put your foot down and didn't let things slide then she wouldn't be so inclined to act the way she is. Maybe you should make her home life just an uncomfortable as she is making yours. Stop caring so much about her feelings when she doesn't seem to care about yours or the situation you find yourself in.", "It actually began 8 months ago but they folded the carpet back and we didn\u2019t have much rain so it was okay for the moment, but then the rain hit horribly again and that\u2019s where we were 4 months ago where the carpet in the room was a swimming pool. They dealt with the carpet within the week but it took them weeks seal the leak on the outside wall, they\u2019re still fixing inside. It\u2019s been a massive struggle and they don\u2019t care unfortunately so they can take plenty of time. There are definitely things we could attempt to do, but we\u2019re worried they\u2019ll evict us for people who can pay higher and they could get away with it for making something up", "I can\u2019t afford the master as I\u2019m not working due to my mental health, and I would move her things but there is a lot off mess and clutter so it\u2019s way too much, plus she needs to go through it and the best way is systematically from room A to room B. She\u2019s been busy recently so I\u2019ve been as understanding as I can. I\u2019ll probably have my room back before she cleans it all out", "Thanks. I really hate yelling too. I admit I do raise my voice due to frustrations, but I only yell if I\u2019m in a crisis or someone\u2019s yelling at me and I\u2019m yelling back without even noticing. I usually try to calm it, sometimes you can\u2019t though. It\u2019s really difficult at times. \n\nShe has too much clutter to move easily and there\u2019s no room to put it outside her door. She needs to go through it systematically as it\u2019s also kind of just a pile of mess.", "Thanks for your comment. Yesterday was so bad that I really wanted to do like you first thought. I was busy this morning though and had bigger priorities, the universe took it into its own hands so something similar happened anyway \ud83d\ude02 I wouldn\u2019t have done it as revenge though, it would\u2019ve been so she could understand how unreasonable it is to think waking up so violently everyday doesn\u2019t affect someone. She\u2019s since woken up this morning and doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m still upset with her. \n\nThere\u2019s too much clutter in her old room and it\u2019s everywhere to move her things myself. It\u2019s an unorganised mess. She\u2019s the only one who knows what to do with everything and it\u2019s a big job. I don\u2019t have the physical strength right now as I\u2019m really struggling to eat so I\u2019m weak, but I\u2019m definitely going to be giving her a deadline. I\u2019ve tried before and it hasn\u2019t worked too well but I\u2019ll be persistent this time to ensure it\u2019s done.", "We\u2019re renting and it\u2019s been a long process. The leak started 8 months ago and they did some things to help but to fix the outside is difficult because it\u2019s a unit block and they also love taking their time. 4 months ago is when the carpet became a swimming pool, they helped with the carpet just under a week from when it began and fixed the exterior a while after that, but waiting for the internal wall and such to get repaired has been a real process and struggle. They can also kick us out as we are wanting to start a new lease agreement with them and if we\u2019re too difficult they could just say no. It\u2019s tough", "We\u2019re definitely difficult roommates. It\u2019s manageable when we have our own space, but without having time apart or recharging, all hell breaks loose. I\u2019m sure when I have my room back we\u2019ll manage a lot better, but this is unmanageable to deal with.", "\ud83d\ude02 that\u2019s hilarious and genius. \n\nAs for the rent split, it\u2019s currently 50/50 as we can\u2019t put the 3rd bedroom up until it\u2019s clear & clean, plus I\u2019m couch surfing in my own house so we\u2019ve decided to wait till I\u2019m back in the room to put the room up.

She is screwing you over.", "I thought you split the rent 50/50", "Just to clarify, i was suggesting you move her things from the master bedroom back to her old bedroom if she can't clear out her old bedroom for you in a reasonable amount of time (which has already passed, but anyway...)\n\nHopefully you get a bed in a bedroom to sleep in soon.", "Please make sure there is no mold from the leak, it\u2019s dangerous to breathe that in. You can get a mold test kit to be sure.", "You still should get a discount while she has 2 rooms and even after she gets the master she should be paying more. She's a terrible roommate tbh.", "We\u2019ve fought about money before, it\u2019s so difficult with friends. I\u2019m going to give her a deadline for the end of next Sunday and mention paying more if she hasn\u2019t moved out completely by then. You\u2019re right about it being unfair", "It\u2019s currently 50/50 as we can\u2019t put the 3rd bedroom up until it\u2019s clear & clean, plus I\u2019m couch surfing in my own house so we\u2019ve decided to wait till I\u2019m back in the room to put the room up. That\u2019s when the price will be split accordingly.", "They cut out the section of wall we believed there was mould. Not sure if it was or wasn\u2019t but there was nothing on the back of the piece and the inside of the wall was dry so that was great to find out (I was extremely concerned about the mould), and I\u2019m not moving back into the room until the carpet has been properly steam cleaned as I have read that\u2019s the best way to remove the majority of bacteria \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc", "Good for you.  Stand up for yourself.  She\u2019s not a great friend if she\u2019s trying to take advantage of you.", "That's not how friends treat friends. She doesn't sound like one.", "If the inside of the wall was dry with no mold, you should be fine. The carpet may be a little musty so cleaning it is a good idea. \n\nI\u2019m a property manager in Florida and I take mold very seriously because it grows so fast here. If people turn off their air conditioners while they are gone in the summer, they come back to problems usually. \n\nI once had clients ask me if they could have the insurance company pay to clean out mold from an empty place. I asked them when it occurred. They said five years ago. So, of course I said no."]}
