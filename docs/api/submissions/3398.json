Around 18 months ago we found out VIA FACEBOOK that a childhood friend of his had proposed to his girlfriend. At this point, I\u2019d met the groom to be (24m) once and the bride to be (24f) never. Me and my bf lived together at this point and still do. We speak about getting engaged next year as we\u2019re saving to buy a home and settle down properly. Around a month after the proposal the groom asked my bf to be the best man. He was confused as they have grown apart massively over the years but overjoyed and of course accepted. I was excited for him too, and suggested the four of us meet up for dinner to celebrate, I added the bride to be on all social media as I already had her SO but wanted to make an effort. That night they created an event for their engagement party.. I was not invited. When my bf asked if I was invited he was told no. Although I was upset I wanted to be polite, so gave my boyfriend a lift and was shocked to see that other gfs who aren\u2019t that close the couple had been invited. \n\nFast forward a few months, and my bf was told by the groom he would not be allowed a plus one. As they \u201cdidn\u2019t want any non-serious partners\u201d my bf explained this wasn\u2019t the case, and even offered to pay for my place if money was an issue. The groom refused and said there\u2019s no way I will be invited. But said I MAY receive an evening invite. \n\nMany of our friends don\u2019t like the bride to be, she has a reputation of being controlling af. \n\nFast forward to now, the wedding is in 6 months, I have met the bride to be a few times in passing and each time suggested meeting up properly. My bf has seen the groom very little. And rarely talks about the wedding obviously to protect my feelings. But it still hurts and as the day draws closer I don\u2019t understand it. \n\nI have now found out the bridesmaids have plus ones yet the best man does not. The brides hairdresser\u2019s husband even has an invite. And a few of my friends who barely know them have been invited. \n\nAfter this I said enough is enough, I\u2019ve done nothing to the bride or groom and even tried to make an effort. So I asked my bf if he would consider just stepping away from the whole thing. He said he\u2019s in too deep and it would be an \u2018awkward\u2019 conversation and I should just go to the evening but I feel I just can\u2019t. And out of respect for me and our relationship he should take the stand and not be the best man, either go as a guest in the evening with me, or completely step away. I was surprised he didn\u2019t do it originally and the longer it goes on the more upset and angry I get. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1669584766, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z6da1i/aita_for_expecting_my_bf_to_step_down_as_best_man/", "score": 117, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And the reason was because the bride wanted to introduce my boyfriend to her BFF. Wedding happened, boyfriend dumped pregnant me for that BFF. \n\nI have a much better life right now, and I\u2019m glad that\u2019s all behind me - but honestly, if your partner is going along with excluding you from the event: that\u2019s breakup worthy.", "This is so bizarre that you specifically are being excluded??", "INFO: Are you \"different\" in some way from your boyfriend and everyone else who was invited to the wedding?

They'd grown apart.  Groom makes him his best man.  How does this make sense?   Doesn't Groom have other male friends?  Clearly none who'll be his best man.  Makes me wonder, is Groom so anti-social or unpleasant that he has no other friends to ask, or has Bride driven all of his friends away with controlling BS like not allowing a plus one to the wedding?  Bride was described as having a rep for being \"controlling af.\"  Controlling people will often try to isolate their partners.  \n\nThat said, while BF can certainly make his own decisions and attend the wedding even if his supposedly serious GF is snubbed, decisions have consequences.

Take that weekend and go out of town. This is a childhood friend he will likely have very little contact with after the wedding.

Seriously, he went to an engagement party without you when others had their GF's?

What is your boyfriend thinking? I\u2019ve been planning weddings for 10 yrs and ANY bestman would be allowed a plus one if they wanted, regardless of the importance of the relationship.", "Either the bride wants to fix up OP's bf at the wedding or OP is persona non grata with the bride and possibly more.", "Not enough info.

The groom has probably been isolated by his relationship and doesn't have a lot of his own friends. That's why he had to ask your BF even though they weren't close for a long time. A lot of weddings have to cut out guests to save space. I imagine most of the bride's guests don't get cut but the groom's do, hence why your BF didn't get a plus one. It's not personal to you, it's just about what she wants.   \nI definitely don't know this to be the case, but there are situations where some guys are basically held hostage by their partners. This sounds like that.   \nYou're definitely NTA, but if I'm your BF I'd probably go through with it at this point.", "You guys were dating for 6 months when this happened? Was there any relationship issues? \n\nSounds like she doesn't like specifically you, or she was going to set up your bf with someone. \n\nWait...they were engaged for 2 years and there was all this talk about plus ones??\n\nSomething is very weird about this story.", "NTA - those sorts of people aren't worth having in your life. They don't seem to have given any legitimate reason as to your exclusion (considering other people have been invited). Your bf sounds like he is letting them walk all over him", "Nta. But last time I said anything about +1s are for the truly single and good manners dictates you view couples as a social unit and therefore both of you should be invited...got down voted to oblivion. Redditors reminded me it's the couple special day and good manners don't apply. The happy  couple can burn down their venue for all they care since rules don't apply to them, on this, the day of their wedding. \n\nIn the end this is really about and your BF, not them. Him not standing his ground when you weren't invited is bad form. You should be seriously thinking about if this is the kind of relationship you want. Apparently even estranged friends have a higher ranking than you. That's not cool.", "Any help would be appreciated also on how I handle this situation!", "NTA.

He should have either fought harder for you or dropped off from the wedding as soon as this started being an issue. The fact that he isn\u2019t that close with the groom anymore but still chose to stay on despite this is more concerning. I hate to jump right to cheating but because of his reactions to it- the reason I\u2019m getting is that someone else is going to the wedding who the couple want to set your boyfriend up with and he has already taken an interest in her.

If anyone treated my partner or even a friend like that I\u2019d tell them to pound sand", "NAH \n\n\nIt's his friend and he's entitled to friends and their events without you.\n\n\nThat said, this \"friend \" of his thinks you're not serious and uhm, why would he think that if your BF didn't present you that way?\n\n\nAs far as the bridesmaids getting a plus one, honestly brides frequently decide the wedding is just for them and don't give a shit about the groom or anyone there for him. I don't think it's right, but it's probably not about you personally. \n\nNobody is entitled to an invite to a wedding.  Even shitty bridezillas get to decide who comes and who doesn't. \n\nYou're not wrong to be bothered.  By going without you BF is  confirming that you're not serious or important.  It's not about the wedding though, it's about how he sees you and where he places your importance in his life that is problematic.", "Clearly YTA", "Honestly, ESH. Sounds like you\u2019re specifically a problem and based on your first paragraph about adding the bride to be on everything not having met her, you sound pushy and presumptuous. Idk what their issue is with you, but I can imagine it.\n\nExpecting him to drop out this late in the game over people you don\u2019t even know, plus me having the feeling we\u2019re not getting the full story from you\u2026.and the bride and groom not coming out and telling you or your bf their clear issue with you makes everyone a bit sus here.", "I was wondering the same thing, but from the opposite angle... If OP doesn't know bride or groom very well, but bride is so vehemently opposed to OP being at the wedding, what the bride is objecting to? Specifically something superficial, like OPs skin color or ethnicity, weight, or general appearance (tattoos, hair color, dress sense)? Maybe OP is much prettier than the bride? Maybe OP has a visible disability? And if any of these are the reason, then OPs BF is also an AH for not sticking up for OP and backing out of a wedding to someone he's not very close to.", "This is my thought too. If she\u2019s the only one being excluded, there\u2019s a reason. One or both of them have an issue with her directly for some reason that she doesn\u2019t want to admit or doesn\u2019t see what she\u2019s done wrong.", "This! I mean the hairdresser and husband are invited but not the best man's gf, sounds like something else is going on. If this is the whole story and op doesn't understand what's going on, I'd have a chat with bf and see what's been said. Maybe bf was the one who told them that they're not that serious? Too many things here not adding up...", "That was my first thought as well. There is definitely something missing here that OP either isn\u2019t divulging or is in denial about.", "The irony in calling the bride controlling while trying to control what her boyfriend does is just\u2026 astounding", "Personally, I'm betting on OP being a different ethnicity from the couple, or something of that nature. That happens a lot.", "I hope they cheated on each other immediately and are miserable for the rest of their lives. That wicked bride too. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re doing well these days!", "I'm wondering if maybe the groom thought she was attractive and his bride is jelly? Or maybe they don't like her style or something stupid like that.", "I\u2019m pretty sure the bride wants to set your boyfriend up with one of her friends. That\u2019s the only thing I can think of, if you don\u2019t have bad blood.", "So sorry this is happening to you Op! \n\nNTA\n\nI think that they may be trying to set up your boyfriend with someone like others have said OR, I saw on another AITA post one time, that the bride didn\u2019t want to be upstaged because someone\u2019s girlfriend was too good looking and they didn\u2019t want her there. So, are you super hot? (No need to actually answer this for me, but it may be a factor). Another possibility is that someone else holds a grudge against you and they are choosing that person over you for the ceremony. All of it is super weird though. \n\nI think your guy IS in too deep. BUT, maybe it\u2019s a friendship he should drop if he isn\u2019t getting a plus one or you are being acknowledged. Can he have a conversation with the groom and bride again? I\u2019m sure they can get another best man. \n\nFurther why can\u2019t you come to the ceremony (what\u2019s stopping anyone)? You can join the reception later. Or is it all in one venue? \n\nEnsure your guy sees this thread so he is wary and has his alarm bells on if any ladies start approaching him or throwing themselves at him. I smell trouble.", "He needs to stand up like an adult and ASK THEM.  Tell them \"this is weird as fuck, why did you refuse to allow my girlfriend to come when every other person gets a +1\"?  It's a pretty simple question, and even he is saying it's weird.", "NTA\n-Tbh, if I was you I would be pissed that my bf isn\u2019t stepping up for me. I think it\u2019s perfectly reasonable for your bf to back out, even if he is already in deep- he should be just as pissed as you. If I were in his position I would refuse being best man if they were intentionally not inviting you for some stupid snobby reason. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through this, I hope he sticks up for you in the end and decides to back out!", "Are you white? So often is racism a reason...", "As a lot of other people have said are you POC? Or Hot? Or maybe she\u2019s trying to set him up with a friend. Either way I think you should think about your relationship and make sure this is the only time he\u2019s chosen someone else feelings over yours. If it is then it\u2019s a mistake and y\u2019all can work past it but if not \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "HAHA love this", "There must be another reason she's not telling or perhaps not aware. You don't have to be a serious girlfriend to be a plus one. It's not that serious. Most brides and grooms don't care that much unless it's someone they don't want at their wedding. I would suggest they talk about it,maybe it's something she did or said that pissed off the bride. Perhaps she didn't even realize it. It's not all for nothing. On the other hand, if I am the best man, my SO should be there too as I am part of the bridal party. So he should have stepped down.", "I was wondering if the maid of honor is single....", "You ask your boyfriend why a person he hasn\u2019t seen since childhood is placed above you. Why is he allowing this to continue??", "I would leave your boyfriend if I were you, he has proven he doesn\u2019t have your back. Is this a quality you want in a future spouse? These people are not worth your time. They all sound terrible", "NAH. Your anger totally justified. How rude of them! but also I can see how it might be too awkward for your husband to back out now. Since you both seem to agree on how weird this is, I say you skip it all together and your husband goes alone. Just ignore them and their wedding. Not worth a fight.", "Be the bigger person.  Kiss your bf and send him to the wedding with your best wishes.   Find something else to do, whether it's hang out with a gf or just curl up with a good book.  \n\nOnce this one day is over, have a talk with the bf.  Find out what he was thinking.  If he gives you a weak answer, then you can evaluate from there. \n\nIt really is one day, just one day.", "The crux is: It's not about you. It's their wedding, it's his role as best man, it's one event.\n\nFor whatever reason she has an issue with you and that's her problem. She's weird and controlling. But.\n\nDon't make it your bf's problem or get in the way of his friendship. Then you become an equally weird and controlling gf.", "If he would continue to go without you then thats your red flag.\nEven if its one day before he can back out. \nThey are treating his future wife like shit why does he except this?\nYes it's only one day but the day is 6 months away so enough time to find someone else.\nHe doesn't even has good contact with the dude so why is he choosing them over you? I don't get it and it's nothing to do with you being controlling but you wanting backup of you s.o. because you supposed to be a team.", "This is not a debate sub asking for advice can get your post removed btw.", "This ^ he needs to step up for her..", "The hairdressers partner is invited.  Apparently everyone elses SO is invited.  Except for OP.  Not seeing how this makes OP the AH.", "In line with reddit drama either Op is extremely attractive and the bride felt intimidated by her, Op used to date/sleep with the groom/someone close to the bride who she wanted at the wedding, or Op originally got with her current bf as a mistress and the bride is super against cheaters but the groom really wanted his childhood friend there so the compromise was no Op.", "All very interesting I points. I hope we get a post-nuptial update if OP ever tells us everything or finds out more (depending on the scenario).", "The missing, missing reasons.", "Possible. There was another Reddit tale where a woman who was a bridesmaid was denied a plus 1 because a friend of the groom wanted to hit on her. Worse it was a guy she knew and couldn\u2019t stand.\n\nOP, NTA. If bf won\u2019t ask, ask the couple directly why everyone else but your bf gets a plus 1.", "Exactly the problem isn't she wasn't invited it is that her bf just let it go and didn't try to fix it either that or it's actually the boyfriend who doesn't want her to go.", "Oh that would be quite the wrinkle wouldn\u2019t it!", "He'll Never have her back. He is not a fit Partner.", "But it doesn't sound like the boyfriend really has much of a relationship with the groom.  I would ask him why he even wants to participate in this if everyone but him will have their girlfriends there.", "It is about them, but why would everyone get a plus 1, but OP\u2019s bf? There is something more to the story and since OP doesn\u2019t know the happy couple that well, there could be something else, like one or both want to set the bf with something else.", "The first reason, I'd imagine, is that when all this started, OP and BF had been together for six months. That's not \"serious\" by most standards.", "Maybe. I don\u2019t get that feeling here. It sounds like the bride has some reason, that\u2019s probably stupid as has nothing specifically to do with OP.", "But you would still give your wedding party a \"plus one\" right? It feels off not to do this for the wedding party & she says that even random guests are getting a plus one. This is weird.", "The way I read it, OP and her bf had been together 2 months when they learned of the engagement. \n\nThat being said, it's been 2 years since.", "Good point, and despite head counts not being final until like a week or two before the wedding, the guest list would had to have been set months before that", "I can only speak to my experience, and, no.\n\nI DIDN'T invite my Bridal Party Plus One. If a married couple,  we invited the couple (John and Jane Smith). If single and dating,  we invited the single (Tom Johnson). If unmarried but long-term, we invited the pair (Kelly Wright and David Lucas). Hell, three of my four SISTERS don't get a Plus One, even though Ilike the people they're seeing (the fourth is married). We offered exactly ONE Plus One outside a long-term relationship, and that's to my Guy Friday, because reasons my fianc\u00e9 and I agree on.\n\nETA: People seem to be under the misapprehension that a wedding is a \"date night.\" I've never understood that.", "And has received an invite to a portion of the wedding in return. There could be seating limitations, budget restrictions or a million other details that the couple can't change now.", "6 months.

I'm getting married next June and my guest list has been locked down since March so I know how to plan my max budget.", "& my experience was to invite a plus one for the bridal party regardless of married/dating/single. Too much gate keeping & felt unecessary for us. Some other guests might've been a single (can't remember ha!!) but Bridal Party were able to bring someone.  For OP, everyone BUT her partner is getting a plus one. Its bullshit.", "And that's the beauty of it. Everyone gets to write their own rules for their own wedding. People don't have to like it and can choose not to attend, and that's okay, too."]}
