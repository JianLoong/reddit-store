I soon found out that my mother hadn't paid our rent for a year. During the year she was working and she would demand I gave her $500 a month for the rent which she obviously wasn't paying. That day I had to find housing for myself and my dog which she didn't help get. She guilt tripped me for not getting her a hotel room or paying for a storage unit for out stuff like she was just expecting me to fix the mess she made. For the past couple of months me and my dog were jumping from my friend dorm room to a hotel to another friends home. It was just a very unstable and difficult situation to be in. I didn't get any support from her we barely talked with the conversations we had mostly being her just asking me for stuff albeit I rarely gave much of a response. Currently she is living in a shelter. \n\nI found an apartment with a friend of mine and have moved in. She recently messaged me and asked what I've been up to and when I told her I found an apartment her response was, \"So were you gonna tell me to go there with you?\" I essentially replied no which lead to her guilt tripping me saying things like would you rather me stay here and that she has changed and counseling at the shelter has helped her and she's in a better place and she wants a relationship with me. I realistically want nothing to do with her. In my mind she put us both through this awful situation, with my case being worse as I have our dog.  I don't trust her and I don't want her in my space... but she is my mother. \n\nWe have never been very close but a part of me feels bad and being homeless is an awful thing to have to go through.

They may not want another person there, especially without change in rent (50/50 to 33/33/33). So even if they agree you will have to pay more. Moreover, your mother seems to be a very unpleasant person. Living with her could be a nightmare and your roomate may withdraw their consent or move out. And then... well, you will be paying for everything and support your mother until you will be evicted again...", "NTA.

However, that doesn't mean that it's on her terms. A good starting point would be for her to return all of the rent money that she stole from you. After that, it's up to you to tell her what, if anything, you want in a relationship with her.", "NTA. Your mom put you in a very bad position and kept trying to get more out of you while you were struggling. I get the feeling she has aleays been \"rescued\" and is trying to get you to continue that pattern. You were able to find stable housing while she hasnt. That should tell you something. \n\nShe is currently in a shelter.  It might not be the most confirtable situation but shes not sleeping rough. She claims thst she got counseling through the shelter so they should have a social worker who can help her find housing. \n\nLastly, you already have a (paying) roommate. They agreed to live with you and your dog. Your shady mom was never part of the deal. I know thats hard to hear but you dont know what happened to that 500 you were giving her each month. I thonk you need to rrspond with this: living together is no longer an option. Ask the shelter for help finding stable housing that you can actually afford.", "NTA. Your mum effectively stole $6000 from you over the course of the year by taking money from you and not paying the rent. Plus, you're renting with a friend - they would have to agree before your mother moved in.", "NTA. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a right or wrong decision here. Both options are difficult.", "NTA...\nIt's not a relationship with you she wants...its a free place to stay and for you to provide for her. She wasn't happy for you,  or relieved your life was easier.. just irritated that you had made plans for yourself,  not for her. \n\n Also this isnt your JUST your home,  its your friends too. They're even less required to care about her bullshit than you should. There's no room for her wants,  in the agreement you made with them. \n\nLet's be real here. This woman lied to you,  technically stole from you ( you gave money for RENT not mommys free for all . That's deceptive and is covered as theft) She's also manipulative, trying to manipulate you into seeing \"a relationship\" and providing housing as one , which they are not. She did not care about your safety or wellbeing,  when she left you homeless....Shes not been out there looking for a place for YOU to stay in..no just planned on leaching onto you. Don't let the threat of her being homeless or \" on the streets\" guilt trip you. She didn't care to leave you,  her child,  homeless and on the streets did she? She didn't feel like she owed you a damn thing...so you don't owe her shit! \n\nShe's treated you,  WORSE than strangers do... maybe this separation is the universe's way of setting you free from her toxicity and leaching way. \n\nThe best thing you could do is to keep your distance.  Some people you have to love from afar. If YOU choose to want a relationship,  it must be on your terms... and housing in a place you share,  isn't it.\n\nI can just about guarentee that once you make it VEEEERRRRYYYY clear,  those terms include not being responsible for her in any terms,  especially financially or in housing,  suddenly she'll expose herself on the fact a relationship with you,  without you providing a life for her,  is NOT of any interest to her.... hey maybe I'm wrong, but the only way you'll ever know,  is to set those boundaries and expectations to her veeerrrry firmly and bluntly,  and see yourself. \n\nMy In-laws are all just like this FIL/MIL both being the worst.  They expect to be taken care of by their adult son and when they finally accepted that's not an option they wanted nothing to do with him...of course they ( FIL, BIL etc)  still pop up occasionally on the explanation of \" wanting a relationship \"... but it's only to see if SO can be swayed or manipulated into giving in and once he can't,  back off to rage and ignoring him they go.\n\nIf you have to \"pay\" for her relationship its not worth it. These people always want more,  never less. Give her an inch,  she'll be demanding the next 10 miles, then 100, 1000 and on and on it goes.\n\nSaying no now, meaning it and NOT CAVING under ANY circumstances,  will save you a lifetime of heartbreak and manipulation.", "No you aren\u2019t the ah.", "NTA - and if you give in and help her now, she will never change and will ruin your current situation. She needs to solve her own issues and as an adult, it is time for you to set boundaries. She can come into your life when she has shown you that she has truly changed. Through her \u2018actions\u2019 not just her word ( which clearly isn\u2019t worth much).", "NTA as ive already commented but I wanted to add to this..\n\n>I didn't get any support from her we barely talked with the conversations we had mostly being her just asking me for stuff\n\n>I don't trust her and I don't want her in my space... but she is my mother. \n\nYou see what being your mother means to HER right?!?! Nothing...unless you can take whatever resources you can scrounge up and drop them into her hands,  Scott Free.\n\nLet yourself off the hook. She isnt worthy of you.  Life is trying to teach her to grow the hell up and take care of herself. You helping,  is interrupting Her Karma so.. and will cause yourself some undeserved Bad Karma. Just don't...\n\nIf don't want to spend the rest of your life,  being HER mother,  don't give in.\n\nEverytime you give in, it just makes her that much worse,  and her expectations and demands that much more.  Its easier and kinder to yourself,   to say no now,  than after a lifetime of her manipulating yes's out of you.  \n\nYou can do this! And for what its worth,  I, a online stranger and unbelievably proud of you for staying strong and saying no!!!\n\nYou got this! We're all here cheering you and your cute pup on!", "NTA and do not even consider letting your mother move in. She's stolen from you before and a few months counseling in a shelter is not enough to make her change her ways. She's an adult--she'll figure it out.", "Maybe start visiting her at the shelter if possible, see how she reacts with a compromise of visits and chats before you think about rebuilding a relationship with her. If she gets angry and snaps again right away, the whole \u201cI\u2019m better\u201d is probably manipulation.", "[removed]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
