Prior to our baby, we used to split the chores around the house. We both vacuumed and cleaned the bathrooms, if one cooked then the other one does the dishes. We also have dogs and we would both walk them in the morning and at night. After my wife became pregnant, I was doing a lot more of the chores around the house which I was fine with since she couldn't do as much anymore due to lack of mobility and chemicals from the cleaners for the bathrooms. We still walked the dogs to get my wife some exercise during the pregnancy.\n\nI am work from home 4 days of 5 days, 8-9 hour days with one day being in the office. My work isn't super stressful, but I have deadlines.\n\nAfter the birth, my MIL and mom switched off staying with us for the first month to help us around the house. This allowed my wife and I to focus on our baby and allowed me to help my wife with whatever she needed; whether it was to help feed the baby, change its diaper, or clothed the baby. However, after the month of help, both our parents went back home and everything was now on us to cook, clean, laundry, dogs, and taking care of the baby.\n\nMy wife has been on maternity leave since the birth of our baby and I haven't taken my leave yet and don't plan to until my wife goes back to work. So after the birth of our baby, I still work my normal hours. However, I still try to help out whenever she asks me to help with the baby when I can step away then I will. So she's not doing all the baby stuff by herself.\n\nThis is where I'm wondering if ITA\n\nMy wife on maternity leave is pretty much a \"stay at home mom\" since all she's doing is just taking care of the baby; however, that's almost all she does. I've joked around with her saying that she's currently a \"stay at home mom\" but she's not pulling her weight around the house other than taking care of the baby and I still help her with the baby too. During the mornings if it's a sunny day then my wife will walk with the baby in the stroller while I'm the one walking the dogs; however, if it's a rainy then it all falls solely on me to do it all. I'm also the one who takes the dogs for a walk in the evening. I cook dinner and I'd say 9.5 out of 10 times I'm also the one either doing the dishes or putting them into our dishwasher. I always make the bottles every night.\n\nBaby is on formula.\n\nA normal day for my wife is feeding the baby every 3 hours at 7am and put to bed at 8pm.\n\nWeekends, I do 50% baby duties while still doing the cooking, dishes, and taking the dogs out in the evenings.\n\nI've told my wife that I'd switch with her at night where I feed the baby and she takes the dogs out but she brushes it off without an answer.\n\nI'm starting to feel burned out helping with the baby and the chores.\n\nSo WIBTA for thinking that my wife should be doing more than just taking care of the baby?", "created_utc": 1676105956, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10zgllm/wibta_think_my_wife_needs_to_do_more_around_the/", "score": 4429, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Even taking in mind that breastfeeding put me in deep psychosis when I tried to take my and my baby's life (luckily our dog saved us both on many times not letting me near any window) I can tell you that formula feeding is much bigger mental load (what is dose, do o have enough water, when I fed last time so baby won't have stomach ache, do we have enough formula, am I failure to not breastfeeding, did I chose correct formula for my child, what if I missed recall and the formula at home is health risk...).

Your wife is still recovering from pregnancy and childbirth, all the while adjusting to new hormones and parenthood. You may not know, but she could also be struggling with postpartum depression or anxiety, which can show up anytime in the first year and can be absolutely debilitating. \n\nHere\u2019s why I say soft YTA. I think you just need to adjust expectations and timelines. Your wife and her body did a miraculous thing that took 40 long weeks to complete. Give her time to heal and get \u201cback to normal\u201d. It makes sense that something that took 40 weeks wouldn\u2019t be healed in 12. \n\nSo it may look like you taking on additional workload for a while. If you\u2019re burning out, get help. Hire a cleaning service. Use a meal kit or Instacart for groceries. Prioritize chores instead of doing it all. \n\nI do think that is is appropriate to let your wife know how you\u2019re feeling while also holding space for her needs. In time, likely after she has returned to work and adjusted to that change, you can decide the new normal and how to break up childcare and household maintenance activities. \n\nBottom line, give it time. Hire help if you need it.", "YTA.  Period.  \n\nWelcome to parenthood. Step up and do what you're supposed to do.  No, you won't get a gold star for doing what you're supposed to do anyway.  \n\nIf the baby, dogs and housework are too much for you to handle, give the dogs away to someone else to ease your schedule and workload and stop complaining. You don't work 24/7 so your job is to clean house and help when you're not. \n\nYour wife and baby are top priority so treat them like they are.", "Very soft YTA because I'm in the same position as you in terms of baby age. The house is just going to be messy my man. It's not going to be properly tidy for years. \n\nYou need to get your head out of how it was and embrace the now. Especially if we're talking 2 months since the baby arrived. No one gives a shit about the mess when you have an active baby crying all day.", "Nah. You're pitching in right? This is what parenting is. You have a newborn. You're tired, so is she. You're both tired. You're both taking care of your baby. You're both taking care of your house and home.\n\nPlease understand that she gestated and pushed out your baby. She's on leave to recuperate. Accept that this really wouldn't be one of those things that you can divide clearly an amount of work and assign it to ones of you. You're partners in this, one picks up the slack for the other when they're lagging. You won't know how her body is feeling right now, and it's not like she can exactly tell you how the hormones are affecting her body. \n\nTalk to each other. If the two of you still feel overwhelmed, if you can, hire a nanny. Or negotiate with your cleaners to take on more of the cleaning. Talk with your wife. You're partners in this. Keep doing what you're doing. Also, be kind to one another.\n\nThe days are long, but the years are short.", "YTA. You have no idea how much work a newborn is clearly. Pull your weight.", "Nta. She could help and do more.", "YTA", "Yep you will never be able to walk in a woman\u2019s shoes when babies come along you don\u2019t get to sleep regularly for about six months your baby mama is so tired she doesn\u2019t know how to even explain it.", "all i read was the title and i\u2019m fuming", "I think it's something you need to communicate with your wife about rather than on here. Everyone can guess where she is emotionally and physically after the birth but she is the only one that knows. You need to sit down and talk to her about what you both can reasonably do with regards to chores and the baby. If the chores are the main thing making you feel burnt out would it be worth it to temporarily get a house cleaner to come in and help? If it's the baby, a nanny? We can't say you or her are the asshole as we don't know the extent of everything truly. You are working and taking on a lot which is draining but she also has gone through an incredible life and body changing event with a lot of hormones and most likely physical pain but you both need to communicate your limits with each other so you can meet in the middle.", "\u201cI've joked around with her saying that she's currently a \"stay at home mom\" but she's not pulling her weight around the house other than taking care of the baby and I still help her with the baby too.\u201d\n\nINFO: which part is the joke?", "Some people think that pregnancy is a breeze, and POOF once baby emerges the woman just goes back to normal internally. And let's not even mention the new physical and mental load. Apparently women can just shoulder EVERYTHING and not need any kind of adjustment at all. \n\nMan's acting like maternity leave is a holiday.", "Hard agree. Wife is still healing from a traumatic health event (that many women still die from, or come away with physical complications from), all in the name of growing their family. But gee, OP had to walk the dog and make dinner.", "Seriously! I have never heard someone refer to maternity leave as being a SAHM. So much of maternity leave is blank to me because I was so physically, emotionally, mentally drained AND I had an A+ partner who never squawked at a request for help. Granted, I had a C Section with many complications, but still. I would have been pissed if my husband ever told me I needed to walk dogs in the rain, or take better care of the house when I\u2019m literally keeping his spawn alive. OP YTA, have fun when you take leave and wife is back to work.", "Absolutely this.", "No, she hasn't been evaluated but I've checked with her to make sure she's feeling ok or if she has needed anything. We also have a couple friends who have babies around the same age, so she's able to talk with them and from what my wife has told me, we are in a MUCH better place than our friends.\n\nWe actually did ask the MIL and mom to come help after birth as that did relive a huge burden on us during that first month and allowed for us to get the baby into a really good routine and around one to two weeks ago has been sleeping on average per night 9-10 hours.\n\nI definitely don't think that taking care of a newborn isn't a full-time job. I know it is.\n\nI just needed to ask to see if my thinking was wrong and if I just need to suck it up and just deal with it.", "I wonder who feeds the baby at night; newborns can wake up for several hours overnight which will cause mental fatigue. He's saying the baby sleeps 11 straight hours every day which is unrealistic.", "Still won't be a fair comparison because he didn't grow then birth the human, he won't be in a shit storm of hormones trying to take care of a bewildered, clueless new human... he will have all his physical and emotional capacity plus a baby in an established routine with known expectations for their care by the time OP has to sub in.", "the baby is a little over 3 months now", "Wow can you back off? You know, he makes a bottle every night, bc she isn't pulling her weight breastfeeding. That involves measuring water, shaking the bottle, then putting it in a warmer. That's a lot! /s\n\nIt's a big adjustment, but that just stood out to me like such a petty dig. I hate that my friends/family that have so much random guilt bc their body just won't cooperate with nursing. They just created a whole person!! They did an amazing job already!!", "I never once thought it would get easier once the baby arrived.\n\nFunny you say that about my baby. They are sleeping from the time we put them down till about 6-7am. Averages about 10 hours a night now and has been for the past week or two now.", "I help with the baths, dressing the baby is about 60/40, I do tummy time with him when I'm not working and he's awake, I try to help with putting the baby down for naps if I can step away from work, but I do help put the baby to bed with my wife.\n\nI do most of the laundry for the baby.\n\nAs for paperwork, I'm assuming you're talking about bills? If so then she does it cause she is very meticulous with how she wants it done even though I've tried to do it before.\n\nDuring the weekends, I do most of the early morning feeds and changes while my wife sleeps in.", "Exactly. My friend had a baby a little over a year ago and the poor little thing would only sleep during the day ON her so she couldn\u2019t really do anything else at those times.", "I would say that she had recovered pretty well as she has started working out again. She had a c-section, but I made sure during her recovery that she didn't do any lifting or being on her feet for any period other than necessary. Also she ate very clean and healthy and made her stay super hydrated.", "I made sure my wife didn't lift a finger other than feeding our baby and even then we were taking turns feeding them and i was doing all the disper changes.  This was until my wife was ok to walk around with very little too no discomfort. She didn't lift our baby until the Dr gave the ok.", "We do have family close by but still 45 minutes away. Right now we still don't feel that being at a little over 3 months old is enough to have the baby being watched by someone else yet.", "No, she does not appear to be depressed. I've made to sure check up on her and ask her how she's feeling. I've always made sure to remind her that she just gave birth and that it will take her time to recover back to her old self and don't rush it.", "I bet if they actually wrote down everything each person does every day it would look a lot more even than what is mentioned here. For example, cooking responsibilities aren't even discussed. \n\nHe seems outwardly supportive but internally resentful so maybe this action, tracking what a full day or week looks like for each of them would be beneficial.", "She just GREW a fucking baby. He needs to suck it up. She had a MAJOR medical procedure.", "the baby is now over 3 months", "I blame celebrity culture. People see celebrities bounce back from pregnancy in a few short weeks, shown naked on the cover of magazines and in the real world we\u2019re healing from 2nd degree tears.", "Look at it this way. If you were to hire someone to do what she\u2019s doing (just looking after a baby) you\u2019d actually have to hire two people - a Nanny and a Night Nurse. \n\nPlus her body is still very much recovering from childbirth and pregnancy. Imagine you\u2019d had part of your intestines removed, or a lung, say. Just in terms of the medical procedure, do you think you\u2019d be up to much housework after 3 months ? Or would you still be trying to rest and recover ?\n\nLook the new baby bit is that hardest part of having a child, IMO and mine are all teenagers now. They may still horribly surprise me, lol. \n\nBut that first six months sucks horribly, no way around it. My first slept through after 4 months and I was still almost dead on my feet. He was on formula as well. \n\nBabies also go through cluster feeding, where they just eat continuously for three or four weeks, and also sleep regression, where they start waking up every 45 minutes while you pray for death. \n\n**You are doing a good job**. You are being a good husband and carrying the burden of the household work while your wife recovers and looks after your child. \n\nAnd yes, it *is* bonkers. We never used to live like this - in the old days you\u2019d be living with Grandmas and Aunties and sisters and cousins who would all help to look after the baby. You are quite literally doing the job of an entire village, by yourself. No wonder you\u2019re tired and pissed off. \n\nMy advice is to crank up the cleaner and/or get a laundry service, if you can afford it. \n\nI would also ask if the Grandma\u2019s can kick in again - even just a Grandma saturday afternoon so that you can both sleep / clean / bulk cook / flump in a heap.\n\nBonus advice: I\u2019m a Reference Librarian by trade, and the single most helpful book I have read on parenting is call [\u201cHunt, Gather, Parent\u201d](https://www.amazon.com/Hunt-Gather-Parent-Ancient-Cultures-ebook/dp/B08BZX94C2/ref=sr_1_1?crid=D0U8BZ3NKLJB&keywords=Hunt+gather+parent&qid=1676115542&sprefix=hunt+gather+par%2Caps%2C483&sr=8-1) I wish it had been published when mine were babies - we had to figure out so much of this stuff ourselves.", "I hid my PPD for MONTHS.

I should have my hand in sling for 6 weeks, I had to ditch the sling after two weeks (my shoulder is busted for a long time, so I can tell semi reasonable time when it is stable enough to not Re dislocate by itslef) because I thought he woud fall asleep on the go.

This is to help them grow and develope so you should wake your baby up to feed them even if they're asleep because babys that age need feeding every 3 to 4 hours to help them grow and also help their little immune systems. Id have a look into if they are sleeping through the night because most likely they arent and ur wife is just automatically waking up to feed them. You should only let them sleep through the night when they reach about 6 months. Also I know you're burnt out and you should have a conversation with your wife about that however i think you also need to look at what she's doing. Taking care of a baby is a mammoth job, for example pay attention to how much time she actually gets alone without the baby. Because thaats probably 95% of her time where she cant even acknowledge her needs. you're 100% entitled to your feelings however you should also address her feelings too. Having a baby can out a huge strain on a relationship and you both need a break even if its just asking one of your family members to take the baby and enjoying eachothers company or to give yourselves a break.

If shes up for it baby wrap/ carriers can help so much with this. They love the snuggles and you get two free hands. \nThen you need to say honestly how you're doing. You're trying to help with all you can, but you're feeling burned out. If she feels up to a few tasks, great, if not, let them slide, ask relatives for help and brainstorm ways together to simplify. (When you ask them, ask for help with x task and holding the baby while you nap, so they don't just come hold the baby)\nYou mentioned you do most of the cooking. Get more takeout if you can afford it. If not get more Costco freezer meals. Look into more crockpot stuff that takes five minutes in the morning. Search for things that are 30 minutes or less to prepare in the evenings. Buy paper plates for this season so there are less dishes. If your dogs would leave it alone, buy a robot vacuum. \nThis season will pass quickly.", "I gave birth 10 months ago, and we're STILL trying to normalize how the household gets handled.

That makes it impossible to determine to what extent the advantages are linked to breastfeeding rather than things like socioeconomic status, sufficient maternity leave, adequate support, maternal stress, access to quality medical care for mother and child, flexible employers who allow you to pump, etc.  In those early years, the baby is very attuned to the parents.", "I say this having just made a bottle of formula for our kid, but there are definitely practical advantages to breastfeeding.\nLike Nestle can rot in hell for all their promotion of formula feeding to impoverished families", "As someone for whom breastfeeding was extremely challenging, I appreciate your outrage, but I could still do it half asleep without cleaning up afterward which isn\u2019t true of bottle feeding.", "And not to mention, screaming at you in a foreign language that has no translation, so you can't even be 100% sure what the demands are!", "I had to get my husband i some really good insulated coffee cups for this reason.

You are entitled to your feelings just as she is.", "So, mom of 3 here. I know the popular idea is that it takes 6 weeks to recover from childbirth, but the reality is that it can take a year or more to fully recover from pregnancy and childbirth. It's a tough hellscape and there could be physical and emotional aspects your wife is dealing with that you don't know about. It's exhausting and difficult to figure out how to get into anything resembling a routine with a new baby. I mean, I'm impressed that she's managing to take the baby for walks! That's a great job! I wouldn't call you an AH, but I think you need to sit down with your wife and have an honest, heart to heart discussion. Be prepared for tears - they're not manipulation, they're hormones and exhaustion. She can't help it. Be sensitive to the fact that she may not understand what is going on with her body and brain either. Recognize that she may not be fully aware of how things look to you. I mean, I have a 5yo, 3yo, and 4 month old and I routinely forget how to function on a day to day basis. My husband and I have spent a lot of time just sitting and talking because we want to make sure we understand each other. So, NAH. Just new parents.", "OP, NTA. I\u2019ve had children, too, and know the first few months are tough on moms. It is true that our hormones are *wack* at that point, never mind the additional stress of sleep deprivation. And our brains being on high alert listening for baby sounds.\n\nStill, it\u2019s a big change for you, too. Im kind of blown away by how easy it is for some to get stuck in \u2018what I felt like\u2019. I didn\u2019t see you ask if you should tell your wife to step it up. I read that you wrote about how *you* feel. You\u2019re not an ass for having those feelings and feeling burned out. Those are legitimate feelings. I\u2019m not going to give you advice, because you didn\u2019t ask for it. Though I do think a couple small changes might help both of you.", "This. \n\nAnother comment said she had a c-section. Like, if this was any other medical event that required surgery and recovery would op feel the same way? Imagine someone coming on here and asking aita for being mad my spouse isn\u2019t helping around the house after major surgery??\n\nAdding a newborn is just the icing on the cake of exhaustion/pain/recovery at this point. YTA", "And, it\u2019s just mind boggling how much care a newborn needs. I still don\u2019t understand it after 3 kids. They supposedly sleep 18 hours a day but they manage to also fuss and need attention 18 hours a day. \n\nIt seems like you should be able to feed them, play with them for a few minutes, and put them down for a two hour nap, but in reality, they sleep the whole time you\u2019re trying to feed them, so it takes an hour to get through a 2 oz bottle. Then they\u2019re wide awake, then suddenly they\u2019re overtired and don\u2019t want to nap, and you get them to fall asleep on you for 40 minutes as long as you don\u2019t move a muscle, much less get up to pee or shower, and then they\u2019re hungry again.\n\nPlus, like you said, you\u2019re still recovering from pregnancy. I was anemic from childbirth and dead exhausted from never getting more than 3 consecutive hours of sleep (on a good night). I was in estrogen free fall so I was having horrible anxiety and had night sweats all night. And I stunk! Not sure what hormone caused that but I smelled bad. So in the rare times I did get a break, I was really trying to shower (I seriously stank for a couple weeks) and nap with the baby. \n\nMy last babies came as partners, so it was even more challenging. I remember one day when they were about 2 months old and I had actually had something resembling enough sleep for once. They slept at the same time for 1 whole hour, and somehow in that hour, I managed to clean the whole house. I\u2019ve never managed it again: it was like the miracle of the loaves and fishes. And then they didn\u2019t sleep at the same time again for, I don\u2019t know, 4 months. My house was nasty until they were 18 months old and I caved and hired a cleaning lady. I just had children needing me all the time and stuff like chores was impossible.", "Took me to a year + to start feeling like myself again after baby 1 and I am a SAHM for now.  He is 16mths now and I'm pregnant again and sick with covid and it's all kicking my ass right now.  My husband hasn't complained at all when the place is a disaster.

Asked if he was babysitting his kids. I said you mean parenting and all the women called him out. He took it which is good.", "I came to the comments to see how old baby is and whether it was C-section and/or there was some other birthing trauma. I've never had a baby, but I've had abdominal surgery, and I can tell you that I wasn't doing much for chores for 8 wks after. I'm guessing mom isn't past the 8wk mark based on how long maternity leave typically is (at least in the US).", "Seriously. \n\nEach time a father on here says that they \u2018help\u2019 with their children I want to fucking scream.", "He asked if he would be the AH for asking his wife to do more than \u201cjust\u201d take care of the baby. Because he\u2019s burnt out doing so many chores himself. So he\u2019d rather his wife be the burned out one while caring for an infant? That\u2019s a recipe for PPD and resentment. Sometimes in marriage, you take the L for your partners benefit. As a new mother, she needs extra support right now because if you have more than one kiddo, as an experienced mom you KNOW that becoming a mother is freaking hard. It\u2019s so much harder than anyone tells you to have a human being dependent on you for every need. Just the emotional aspect of that is exhausting. So yes, if he tells his wife she needs to do more chores instead of \u201cjust\u201d caring for baby, I\u2019d call him an AH.", "Currently recovering with an 18 month old toddler and a 1 week old newborn to take care of.
