Prior to our baby, we used to split the chores around the house. We both vacuumed and cleaned the bathrooms, if one cooked then the other one does the dishes. We also have dogs and we would both walk them in the morning and at night. After my wife became pregnant, I was doing a lot more of the chores around the house which I was fine with since she couldn't do as much anymore due to lack of mobility and chemicals from the cleaners for the bathrooms. We still walked the dogs to get my wife some exercise during the pregnancy.\n\nI am work from home 4 days of 5 days, 8-9 hour days with one day being in the office. My work isn't super stressful, but I have deadlines.\n\nAfter the birth, my MIL and mom switched off staying with us for the first month to help us around the house. This allowed my wife and I to focus on our baby and allowed me to help my wife with whatever she needed; whether it was to help feed the baby, change its diaper, or clothed the baby. However, after the month of help, both our parents went back home and everything was now on us to cook, clean, laundry, dogs, and taking care of the baby.\n\nMy wife has been on maternity leave since the birth of our baby and I haven't taken my leave yet and don't plan to until my wife goes back to work. So after the birth of our baby, I still work my normal hours. However, I still try to help out whenever she asks me to help with the baby when I can step away then I will. So she's not doing all the baby stuff by herself.\n\nThis is where I'm wondering if ITA\n\nMy wife on maternity leave is pretty much a \"stay at home mom\" since all she's doing is just taking care of the baby; however, that's almost all she does. I've joked around with her saying that she's currently a \"stay at home mom\" but she's not pulling her weight around the house other than taking care of the baby and I still help her with the baby too. During the mornings if it's a sunny day then my wife will walk with the baby in the stroller while I'm the one walking the dogs; however, if it's a rainy then it all falls solely on me to do it all. I'm also the one who takes the dogs for a walk in the evening. I cook dinner and I'd say 9.5 out of 10 times I'm also the one either doing the dishes or putting them into our dishwasher. I always make the bottles every night.\n\nBaby is on formula.\n\nA normal day for my wife is feeding the baby every 3 hours at 7am and put to bed at 8pm.\n\nWeekends, I do 50% baby duties while still doing the cooking, dishes, and taking the dogs out in the evenings.\n\nI've told my wife that I'd switch with her at night where I feed the baby and she takes the dogs out but she brushes it off without an answer.\n\nI'm starting to feel burned out helping with the baby and the chores.\n\nSo WIBTA for thinking that my wife should be doing more than just taking care of the baby?", "created_utc": 1676105956, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10zgllm/wibta_think_my_wife_needs_to_do_more_around_the/", "score": 66, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Even taking in mind that breastfeeding put me in deep psychosis when I tried to take my and my baby's life (luckily our dog saved us both on many times not letting me near any window) I can tell you that formula feeding is much bigger mental load (what is dose, do o have enough water, when I fed last time so baby won't have stomach ache, do we have enough formula, am I failure to not breastfeeding, did I chose correct formula for my child, what if I missed recall and the formula at home is health risk...).

Your wife is still recovering from pregnancy and childbirth, all the while adjusting to new hormones and parenthood. You may not know, but she could also be struggling with postpartum depression or anxiety, which can show up anytime in the first year and can be absolutely debilitating. \n\nHere\u2019s why I say soft YTA. I think you just need to adjust expectations and timelines. Your wife and her body did a miraculous thing that took 40 long weeks to complete. Give her time to heal and get \u201cback to normal\u201d. It makes sense that something that took 40 weeks wouldn\u2019t be healed in 12. \n\nSo it may look like you taking on additional workload for a while. If you\u2019re burning out, get help. Hire a cleaning service. Use a meal kit or Instacart for groceries. Prioritize chores instead of doing it all. \n\nI do think that is is appropriate to let your wife know how you\u2019re feeling while also holding space for her needs. In time, likely after she has returned to work and adjusted to that change, you can decide the new normal and how to break up childcare and household maintenance activities. \n\nBottom line, give it time. Hire help if you need it.", "YTA.  Period.  \n\nWelcome to parenthood. Step up and do what you're supposed to do.  No, you won't get a gold star for doing what you're supposed to do anyway.  \n\nIf the baby, dogs and housework are too much for you to handle, give the dogs away to someone else to ease your schedule and workload and stop complaining. You don't work 24/7 so your job is to clean house and help when you're not. \n\nYour wife and baby are top priority so treat them like they are.", "Very soft YTA because I'm in the same position as you in terms of baby age. The house is just going to be messy my man. It's not going to be properly tidy for years. \n\nYou need to get your head out of how it was and embrace the now. Especially if we're talking 2 months since the baby arrived. No one gives a shit about the mess when you have an active baby crying all day.", "Nah. You're pitching in right? This is what parenting is. You have a newborn. You're tired, so is she. You're both tired. You're both taking care of your baby. You're both taking care of your house and home.\n\nPlease understand that she gestated and pushed out your baby. She's on leave to recuperate. Accept that this really wouldn't be one of those things that you can divide clearly an amount of work and assign it to ones of you. You're partners in this, one picks up the slack for the other when they're lagging. You won't know how her body is feeling right now, and it's not like she can exactly tell you how the hormones are affecting her body. \n\nTalk to each other. If the two of you still feel overwhelmed, if you can, hire a nanny. Or negotiate with your cleaners to take on more of the cleaning. Talk with your wife. You're partners in this. Keep doing what you're doing. Also, be kind to one another.\n\nThe days are long, but the years are short.", "YTA. You have no idea how much work a newborn is clearly. Pull your weight.", "Nta. She could help and do more.", "YTA", "Yep you will never be able to walk in a woman\u2019s shoes when babies come along you don\u2019t get to sleep regularly for about six months your baby mama is so tired she doesn\u2019t know how to even explain it.", "all i read was the title and i\u2019m fuming", "I think it's something you need to communicate with your wife about rather than on here. Everyone can guess where she is emotionally and physically after the birth but she is the only one that knows. You need to sit down and talk to her about what you both can reasonably do with regards to chores and the baby. If the chores are the main thing making you feel burnt out would it be worth it to temporarily get a house cleaner to come in and help? If it's the baby, a nanny? We can't say you or her are the asshole as we don't know the extent of everything truly. You are working and taking on a lot which is draining but she also has gone through an incredible life and body changing event with a lot of hormones and most likely physical pain but you both need to communicate your limits with each other so you can meet in the middle.", "\u201cI've joked around with her saying that she's currently a \"stay at home mom\" but she's not pulling her weight around the house other than taking care of the baby and I still help her with the baby too.\u201d\n\nINFO: which part is the joke?", "Some people think that pregnancy is a breeze, and POOF once baby emerges the woman just goes back to normal internally. And let's not even mention the new physical and mental load. Apparently women can just shoulder EVERYTHING and not need any kind of adjustment at all. \n\nMan's acting like maternity leave is a holiday.", "Hard agree. Wife is still healing from a traumatic health event (that many women still die from, or come away with physical complications from), all in the name of growing their family. But gee, OP had to walk the dog and make dinner.", "Seriously! I have never heard someone refer to maternity leave as being a SAHM. So much of maternity leave is blank to me because I was so physically, emotionally, mentally drained AND I had an A+ partner who never squawked at a request for help. Granted, I had a C Section with many complications, but still. I would have been pissed if my husband ever told me I needed to walk dogs in the rain, or take better care of the house when I\u2019m literally keeping his spawn alive. OP YTA, have fun when you take leave and wife is back to work.", "Absolutely this.", "No, she hasn't been evaluated but I've checked with her to make sure she's feeling ok or if she has needed anything. We also have a couple friends who have babies around the same age, so she's able to talk with them and from what my wife has told me, we are in a MUCH better place than our friends.\n\nWe actually did ask the MIL and mom to come help after birth as that did relive a huge burden on us during that first month and allowed for us to get the baby into a really good routine and around one to two weeks ago has been sleeping on average per night 9-10 hours.\n\nI definitely don't think that taking care of a newborn isn't a full-time job. I know it is.\n\nI just needed to ask to see if my thinking was wrong and if I just need to suck it up and just deal with it.", "I wonder who feeds the baby at night; newborns can wake up for several hours overnight which will cause mental fatigue. He's saying the baby sleeps 11 straight hours every day which is unrealistic.", "Still won't be a fair comparison because he didn't grow then birth the human, he won't be in a shit storm of hormones trying to take care of a bewildered, clueless new human... he will have all his physical and emotional capacity plus a baby in an established routine with known expectations for their care by the time OP has to sub in.", "the baby is a little over 3 months now", "Wow can you back off? You know, he makes a bottle every night, bc she isn't pulling her weight breastfeeding. That involves measuring water, shaking the bottle, then putting it in a warmer. That's a lot! /s\n\nIt's a big adjustment, but that just stood out to me like such a petty dig. I hate that my friends/family that have so much random guilt bc their body just won't cooperate with nursing. They just created a whole person!! They did an amazing job already!!", "I never once thought it would get easier once the baby arrived.\n\nFunny you say that about my baby. They are sleeping from the time we put them down till about 6-7am. Averages about 10 hours a night now and has been for the past week or two now.", "I help with the baths, dressing the baby is about 60/40, I do tummy time with him when I'm not working and he's awake, I try to help with putting the baby down for naps if I can step away from work, but I do help put the baby to bed with my wife.\n\nI do most of the laundry for the baby.\n\nAs for paperwork, I'm assuming you're talking about bills? If so then she does it cause she is very meticulous with how she wants it done even though I've tried to do it before.\n\nDuring the weekends, I do most of the early morning feeds and changes while my wife sleeps in.", "Exactly. My friend had a baby a little over a year ago and the poor little thing would only sleep during the day ON her so she couldn\u2019t really do anything else at those times.", "I would say that she had recovered pretty well as she has started working out again. She had a c-section, but I made sure during her recovery that she didn't do any lifting or being on her feet for any period other than necessary. Also she ate very clean and healthy and made her stay super hydrated.", "I made sure my wife didn't lift a finger other than feeding our baby and even then we were taking turns feeding them and i was doing all the disper changes.  This was until my wife was ok to walk around with very little too no discomfort. She didn't lift our baby until the Dr gave the ok.", "We do have family close by but still 45 minutes away. Right now we still don't feel that being at a little over 3 months old is enough to have the baby being watched by someone else yet.", "No, she does not appear to be depressed. I've made to sure check up on her and ask her how she's feeling. I've always made sure to remind her that she just gave birth and that it will take her time to recover back to her old self and don't rush it.", "I bet if they actually wrote down everything each person does every day it would look a lot more even than what is mentioned here. For example, cooking responsibilities aren't even discussed. \n\nHe seems outwardly supportive but internally resentful so maybe this action, tracking what a full day or week looks like for each of them would be beneficial.", "She just GREW a fucking baby. He needs to suck it up. She had a MAJOR medical procedure.", "the baby is now over 3 months", "I blame celebrity culture. People see celebrities bounce back from pregnancy in a few short weeks, shown naked on the cover of magazines and in the real world we\u2019re healing from 2nd degree tears.", "Look at it this way. If you were to hire someone to do what she\u2019s doing (just looking after a baby) you\u2019d actually have to hire two people - a Nanny and a Night Nurse. \n\nPlus her body is still very much recovering from childbirth and pregnancy. Imagine you\u2019d had part of your intestines removed, or a lung, say. Just in terms of the medical procedure, do you think you\u2019d be up to much housework after 3 months ? Or would you still be trying to rest and recover ?\n\nLook the new baby bit is that hardest part of having a child, IMO and mine are all teenagers now. They may still horribly surprise me, lol. \n\nBut that first six months sucks horribly, no way around it. My first slept through after 4 months and I was still almost dead on my feet. He was on formula as well. \n\nBabies also go through cluster feeding, where they just eat continuously for three or four weeks, and also sleep regression, where they start waking up every 45 minutes while you pray for death. \n\n**You are doing a good job**. You are being a good husband and carrying the burden of the household work while your wife recovers and looks after your child. \n\nAnd yes, it *is* bonkers. We never used to live like this - in the old days you\u2019d be living with Grandmas and Aunties and sisters and cousins who would all help to look after the baby. You are quite literally doing the job of an entire village, by yourself. No wonder you\u2019re tired and pissed off. \n\nMy advice is to crank up the cleaner and/or get a laundry service, if you can afford it. \n\nI would also ask if the Grandma\u2019s can kick in again - even just a Grandma saturday afternoon so that you can both sleep / clean / bulk cook / flump in a heap.\n\nBonus advice: I\u2019m a Reference Librarian by trade, and the single most helpful book I have read on parenting is call [\u201cHunt, Gather, Parent\u201d](https://www.amazon.com/Hunt-Gather-Parent-Ancient-Cultures-ebook/dp/B08BZX94C2/ref=sr_1_1?crid=D0U8BZ3NKLJB&keywords=Hunt+gather+parent&qid=1676115542&sprefix=hunt+gather+par%2Caps%2C483&sr=8-1) I wish it had been published when mine were babies - we had to figure out so much of this stuff ourselves.", "I hid my PPD for MONTHS. I knew I had it while I was still in the hospital - I lied on the questionnaire before discharge so that I would be left alone. \n\nI finally completely broke when my daughter was 10 months old. This was after it went untreated with my son previously. \n\nDon\u2019t assume that because she says she\u2019s fine that she is.", "Also, when you have babies, you have to change standards. The most important thing is the parenting, not the housework. Standards come back as they age.", "Your thinking is wrong. You\u2019re being a baby. This is something you\u2019re gonna have to deal with for the next 18 years so you should start sucking it up like yesterday.", "It also won't be a fair comparison because the baby will be older. The first three months are ridiculous. I think six weeks after I gave birth I noticed that I hadn't even trimmed my nails and I hadn't even noticed because it was just constant baby care.", "And not trying to heal from the birth - both physically and mentally!!", "But it is enough for him to understand, my husband was done after two weeks when I dislocated my shoulder with our son being around 7 month old. I should have my hand in sling for 6 weeks, I had to ditch the sling after two weeks (my shoulder is busted for a long time, so I can tell semi reasonable time when it is stable enough to not Re dislocate by itslef) because I thought he woud fall asleep on the go. And I was still at home doing as much as a coud with one hand only.", "She\u2019s still recovering from pregnancy and birth. She literally grew a person, she needs time to recover from that.", "There is a reason many countries have 12+ months of maternity leave and also why they recommend 18 months minimum between kids. Yeah, it takes that long for moms to FULLY recover.\n\nAlso check in with her more, she may have some form of PPD.\n\nAnd hormones, holy shit ppl talk about pregnancy hormones, but in reality the post partum ones are 100x worse. I don't recall much of my kids first few months of life, I was out of whack hormone side, lack of proper sleep, body trying to physically heal after it got beat up for 40 weeks. \n\nI wouldn't quite call you an AH right now, more like misguided/clueless.

If it were any other medical issue would you expect someone to be 100% with those timelines?", "Try to have some empathy. Your wife grew and carried a human for 40 WEEKS. She then birthed that baby. Her body is exhausted, drained, and is still dealing with a surge of hormones. \n\nIt also sounds like she does the night feedings. Despite you offering to help she has brushed it off. That to me sounds like mild PPD. \n\nYta. \n\nYou don't just push a baby out and poof go back to normal. She is exhausted. On top of which, being a full time care giver is mentally, physically, and emotionally draining. \n\nIt often takes women a full year to really start feeling like themselves again.", "Mu husband thought that too, until I started to wake him up every time baby waked me up at night, he had no idea how our good sleeping babies (and both our kids were great sleepers compared to kids my friends had), it don't have to be crying for food, but they are grunting, snoring, making choking sounds,... All of it need to be addressed if you want to have alive baby in the morning.", "That doesn\u2019t sound good for the baby\u2026 they are supposed to wake up at night, they have very tiny tummies!!

I believe firmly that men don't understand what happens to a woman's internal organs during pregnancy. I really think they believe everything stays the same in there, that our organs don't get moved, compress, or grow several times their original size.

This is to help them grow and develope so you should wake your baby up to feed them even if they're asleep because babys that age need feeding every 3 to 4 hours to help them grow and also help their little immune systems. Id have a look into if they are sleeping through the night because most likely they arent and ur wife is just automatically waking up to feed them. You should only let them sleep through the night when they reach about 6 months. Also I know you're burnt out and you should have a conversation with your wife about that however i think you also need to look at what she's doing. Taking care of a baby is a mammoth job, for example pay attention to how much time she actually gets alone without the baby. Because thaats probably 95% of her time where she cant even acknowledge her needs. you're 100% entitled to your feelings however you should also address her feelings too. Having a baby can out a huge strain on a relationship and you both need a break even if its just asking one of your family members to take the baby and enjoying eachothers company or to give yourselves a break.
