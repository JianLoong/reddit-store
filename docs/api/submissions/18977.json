Is there someone else in the family you are close to, whom you could stay with during your 2-3 yearly visits?  If not, a nice hotel? I would NEVER spend another night at mom's.  So all of those people saying \"mum feels deeply hurt\" [because she was the AH and] \"that I should forgive her and let it go\" ... tell them you are staying at their place the next visit.", "I'm sorry to say this, OP.\n\nBut your mother is a major asshole.\n\nYou are NTA.\n\nI don't blame you for going low contact with your mother.\n\nI would too, after a stunt like that.", "NTA!! She didn't put in the effort to spend time with you and now is upset because of her own actions. It's so time consuming and expensive to go home for the holidays. She has clearly demonstrated that she doesn't care about spending time with you so why put in the effort. You shouldn't do something just to keep the peace, if your family can't see that what she did was so awful, they probably aren't worth your time (I know that can be a really hard thing to deal/ come to terms with). This isn't some little mistake this is a systematic pattern of behavior.", "\"I believe that to be forgiven, more than sorrow is required - at least two more things. First, genuine repentance - a determination to change and to repair breaches of my own making...\"\n\nIf Bill Clinton can say that sht, I'm sure your mum can  do it too. NTA", "Yes, NTA and I can see why OP moved overseas.", "While reading the story I thought, \"Yeah, that's kind of shitty, but is this really gaslighting? Is OP not speaking to their mom just because of this?\"\n\nBut then she turned off the goddamn heat while her kid was staying there, proving that, unfortunately, she doesn't think about them at all. Other than what they can get her.\n\nI'm sorry, OP. NTA", "moms usually fall under the \"family\" category...", "Mom doesn\u00b4t know she\u00b4s wrong - or care that she is wrong\n\nMom knows that she got caught and the rest of the family is shaming her\n\nMom would have been fine if she left OP in the cold house alone and nobody ever found out!\n\nNo GENUINE apology is ever coming out of Mom, only crocodile tears and feeling sorry for HERSELF because the family is shaming her", "No proper apology can come from this Mum because she isn\u00b4t sorry she did it, she is sorry she got caught! \n\nShe is sorry for HERSELF because the family is shaming her.\n\nI would bet 100 that she blames OP because he told the rest of the family what she did\n\nOnly crocodile tears are ever coming out of this Mum, it is up to OP whether he pretends to believe her, or even more sadly, gets that tiny flicker of hope that maybe THIS time is different and she really cares", "Soo she is never happy", "What she did is unforgivable in my eyes. Especially since she hasn\u2019t apologized. But mommy is sad? Well guess what family you are sad too. I wouldn\u2019t trust her again. Nta", "I said ESH. Listening to someone be deeply angry about a single transgression for six months straight strikes me as a horror show.", "Ummm I think it\u2019s the start of early onset dementia. She shut down the heat because she wasn\u2019t going to be there. She forgot that OP was staying there. So sad.", "Down south in England, I'd agree, but I live in the north east of Scotland where it was below zero for nearly a fortnight. And in the Highlands and Royal desiderata it can easily drop to minus 23. Last winter it was too cold for the ski slopes to open.", "Why do SOME people have kids!!!! Gahhhh!!!! If you can't love and care for your offspring - don't reproduce just DON'T!!", ">Royal desiderata\n\nIs that an autocorrect error? I can't find anything Scotland-related with that name when I search.", "We are in accord.", "Narcs like my mom admit to only having us so they\u2019d have someone to take care of them when they\u2019re old", "I understand, yes lots of places areuch worse!", "Which is why we reward narcs with grey rocks and nursing homes.", "Amen!", "I thought they were the old style ones, think the new ones are like a rechargeable card? I know not a lot of shops sell them so you need to know what your doing", "What have gray rocks ever done to deserve that?"]}
