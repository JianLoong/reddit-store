The fact that you mom kept the info that she was going to leave you alone at her house for most of your stay just shows that she knew it was wrong, but she still wanted you to come to spend Christmas with her.

My life is far lower stress and much happier without their behaviour. It sucks to not have parents but having parents who harm you is worse. She's the one destroying the relationship, OP is just the one acting to protect himself from her after one too many hurts", "> The mother cut the heat and left them there by themselves for the 5 days.\n\nIt sounds more like she turned the thermostat down than cutting off the heating to the house for a week. It also sounds like OP grew up in this area so they'd have other family members to visit. Their mother's purpose in life isn't to keep them entertained during the holidays, maybe if they made plans to hang out with their mother I could say NTA, but it just sounds like OP is throwing a tantrum because they felt alone for a few days.", "Your mom is an adult woman. She attended the Christmas events, which as you stated, is the reason you came home. She attended. \n\nYou proceed to tell her she\u2019s gaslighting you, is untrustworthy, is manipulative, and now 6 months later, have not forgiven her for taking some time for her and her friends - again, she\u2019s an adult woman. \n\nShe says you weren\u2019t clear about your plans, you say she wasn\u2019t clear about her\u2019s - it doesn\u2019t matter.
