{"id": 30523, "submission_id": "17q33j8", "title": "AITA for refusing to attend one of my best friends wedding because it's on my birthday weekend?", "selftext": "I (28f) have been very close friends with Jess (29f) for 5 years. Last year, Jess got engaged to Matt. I'm very happy for them both, Matt treats her well and she's very happy.\n\nSince they've got engaged, I've seen Jess maybe twice, when we used to see each other all the time. Fair enough, she's loved up and she's busy wedding planning, but it's gotten to the point where I can't plan anything with her. Any time I ask her to do something she always says she's spending time with Matt. Even if it's months in advance, she says 'I'll see what I'm doing' making me feel like she's waiting for something better to come along.\n\nRecently, I saw on Instagram that she's asked her bridesmaids to be bridesmaids. I'm hurt I've not been asked but I understand that she can't afford to have lots of bridesmaids. \n\nThe thing that hurt the most is that she has not told me a thing about her wedding. She's booked the date and not even said anything, or messaged me to say why I'm not a bridesmaid (again I understand she can't have everyone but given how close we're meant to be I'd have at least expected a courtesy text as it's something I'd do for them)\n\nThen I see on the bridesmaids posts on Instagram the date of the wedding, and its on my 30th birthday. I've never celebrated a significant birthday, and I'd always planned on going on holiday for it. I know now that her and a couple of other friends won't be celebrating with me as they'll be attending the wedding.\n\nI told her that I'd seen the date on another post and that I likely wouldn't be able to attend as I wanted to be away for my birthday. She said 'Yeah I know it was your birthday, but I thought if you were my friend you'd be there regardless'. \n\nI said 'it's not that I don't want to be there, but it's a significant birthday and I've always said about going away for it' she said 'Yeah I know you have, but it's tough'\n\nI said 'well unfortunately I won't be attending'. She called me selfish and hasn't spoken to me since, so AITA?\n\n\nEDIT FOR CLARIFICATION - I feel like people think I'm cutting my nose off to spite my face r.e the bridesmaid thing. I am hurt yes, but I understand why I've not been asked. I ONLY put that comment in to explain how close we were, and that she would have been a bridesmaid at mine. It has nothing to do with my decision making.\n\nI'm also not expecting her to change the date. I would never expect ANYONE to do that. My question is more regarding my refusal to come because I was planning a trip around that time.\n\nI have not received an official paper invitation as they aren't doing them yet, but in the conversation before I said I won't be attending Jess stated she hoped I'd be able to book it off work, indicating that I am invited. \n\nAnd yes, it needs to be that weekend. Nothing is officially booked as you can't book that far in advance, however the 2 weeks before I have exams that I need to study for and the week after is my Mum's 60th so I'll be celebrating with her then.\n\nI appreciate the YTA comments and that's why I felt the need to clarify. My main question is AITA for saying I won't be going.

I spent hours every weekend listening to his complaints and helping him work though various life troubles, coaching him through  issues of trust with his fiance, through multiple job losses, returning back to school after failing to find work, etc.  He always treated me like shit in return though and when his wedding came around he pulled the same thing as your friend did, I was not part of the wedding party and he didnt have the balls to ever let me know that directly.  I declined his invitation to the wedding and decided he wasn't worth keeping as a close friend anymore.

Moreover, she admitted that OP had always talked about doing something special for her 30th. The choice for the bride to schedule on that date might have been for serious reasons she couldn't ignore/were beyond her control.\n\nPending further information, the bride's not telling OP about the wedding date can be interpreted as trying to avoid, for as long as possible, the awkward situation the conflict of dates would raise. Then, when the cat was out of the bag, the bride had to say something in her defense. The explanation: OP would drop every and anything for the wedding, citing that as the sign of a (true) friend.\n\nIf, however, the decision for that date was for reasons beyond the bride's control, why not just say that to OP, apologize for the unwanted conflict, and leave it as \"If you can make it, we would love to have you, but if you cannot, I understand\"?\n\nLastly, OP needs to consider that she only *talked* about doing something special, but has no *actual plans* established (location, reservations, tickets bought, etc.).

Obviously the bride knows when it is and scheduled it that way on purpose.", "because the bride clearly doesn't really care about her? Why spend all that time and money on going to a wedding for someone like that?", "The \"if\" is doing a lot of work there and in any case that's not an invitation. At best it's implying that OP would have been invited in the future. And it came after OP had already RSVPd no.", "Was directed more towards OP saying they tried to make plans months in advance with the response of \"we'll see\" feeling like they were waiting for something better to come along", "I think the bride clearly does not consider OP a \"best friend\" here  \n\n\n(Also your English is very good!)", "Yeah. This makes OP\u2019s friend an asshole", "And expecting her to come along anyways, knowing she set the date on OP's birthday.", "Jess is not responsible for catering to op's voluntary plans. Jess is a jerk for expecting op to drop everything and come to her wedding. But it would be equally awful for op to expect Jess to drop everything to cater to her birthday, even if op already had the tickets booked (and it sounds like she doesn't).\n\nA guest's birthday isn't even a blip on the radar when planning a wedding. When you're planning an event like that, you have to figure out when people are able to come if they want to, when your venue(s) are available and then minor concerns like avoiding the birthdays of immediate family (hopefully!)", "Not even declining an invite. It sounds like she's publicly posting that she won't go before she's even invited.", "But for some reason everyone is on the brides side. The bride brought it up as well and nobody is taking that into consideration when they comment she\u2019s being selfish to assume she was even going to be invited. Most definitely NTA in my book all the way!", "Some people have very large families, and it is usually understood that weddings and funerals take precedence over more common and regular milestones because they are literally once-in-a-lifetime events (weddings hopefully, funerals certainly). There is often a very specific location or church or office that hands out dates, then there is a season the couple chooses, maybe they only have 3 summer weekends where both groom and bride can get vacation days from work. Even if you sent out a Doodle to your 50 family members and 30 closest friends - how likely is it that one of these three weekends has 0 important birthdays, graduations, funerals, anniversaries, promotions etc etc? For 80 people? Chances are 0. You either prioritize the wedding, and celebrate your birthday a couple days later which most people do, or you don't. But it is certainly not easy.", "There is nothing to indicate OP is #1 in the bride's life, just someone who used to spend time with her socially. Assuming that the bridesmaids all are more important to her, it wouldn't be reasonable at all to try to find a date that doesn't conflict with 10+ people's birthdays. Not to mention the venue is unlikely to have availability on every single date in the first place. If OP were the only person in the bride's life, then sure, it would be doable. But she isn't, and they likely have many more pressing issues to consider when picking a date.", "Did you poll all of your friends and family to make sure your wedding didn\u2019t conflict with any of their important dates before you scheduled? I didn\u2019t even o that with my wedding party, let alone every single guest. I invited 150 people to my wedding. It would be completely unreasonable to avoid all of their birthdays and other dates and find a date that the venue, photographer, caterer you want  was available AND avoid anyone else\u2019s wedding that might conflict with yours.", "Most people would think that they'd be willing to celebrate their birthday a week early or late. My birthday is in April in the midst of Easter, spring break, final exams, sports, and vacations. Growing up, I never celebrated my birthday in april. You don't need to celebrate your birthday exactly on your birthday. It's totally fine to plan it another weekend.\n\nAnd I understand it's a 30th birthday and is a milestone. I just turned 30, and I didn't think of it as a milestone, but that's a separate point. You have a birthday every year. Some people only have one wedding which is why it is viewed as more higher priority.", "Yeah. It\u2019s fine for Jess to have not scheduled around OP\u2019s birthday, but she should drop the attempt to guilt OP into forgoing OP\u2019s intended trip in order to go to the wedding instead. Jess isn\u2019t acting like a close friend to OP when it comes to her own choices, so she shouldn\u2019t expect OP to.", "This is where I'm at too. Jess seems to have lost interest in maintaining a friendship with OP for some time now. \n\nI'm not blaming Jess, as not all friendships last forever, but based off what OP has said, Jess has been ghosting her. They're clearly moving in different directions in their lives. OP isn't a jerk for wanting to take a trip for her 30th birthday. You're only 30 once, and some adults still like to celebrate their birthdays.\n\nOP is NTA.", "Wait why would OP be TA if they were still close???", "Disagree. Why would you schedule your wedding during a close friends major milestone? Totally NTA regardless.", "It\u2019s only if you sulk about people prioritising their own days/commitments during your wedding that\u2019s the issue really. If you hold friendships hostage over not going to your wedding bc of a milestone birthday or something else then that\u2019s crappy. Which is what Jess is doing.", "They've seen each twice in over a year... They are not close. I doubt the bride-to-be was even thinking about op when trying to arrange and plan her wedding.", "OK so it just boils down to OP feeling that her birthday is more important to her than the friends wedding.\n\nI guess that's a fine perspective to have... But it's also okay for the friend to feel the opposite, that her wedding is more important to her than OPs birthday.", "Ah, right, OK. Yea, it definitely sounds like this friend isn't interested in being friends anymore. Sometimes that happens unfortunately.", "Yeah, that was my point. Honestly, I've put up with someone similar to OP for a long time and at times while dealing with personal stuff as well so I kind of relate to OP to a degree \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f.\n\nThankfully, for my part, we went NC for a while and it gave us both space to grow as individuals and we recently met by chance and we actually talked without hard feelings and it was nice. \n\nBut I think OP should bite the bullet here and just enjoy her birthday weekend. If it had just been a matter of being upset bc of the bridesmaid stuff I would've said YTA but OP is definitely NTA here.\n\n(Thanks \ud83d\ude01)\n\nEDIT: typos and missing words \ud83d\ude05", ">I think the bride clearly does not consider OP a \"best friend\" here\n\nThis is the case.", "Yup", "BINGO!", "Yea, I mean she shouldn't plan her wedding around her sort of friend's birthday obviously, but she also shouldn't get offended when friend doesn't want to come.  I might get offended if my sister or my best friend chose their birthday over my wedding, but a) I probably WOULD plan not to have my wedding on their birthday, and b) neither of them would chose their birthday over my wedding because we are very very close.  Obviously these two aren't close.", "A wedding is voluntary too, hope this helps \u2764\ufe0f", "Not publicly though if it\u2019s a reply to a story", "Most people feel a bride can do no wrong.\n\nI disagree.  When a bride slights and disrepects people, the fact she's a bride doesn't give her a pass. Under that theory, a bride would never be TA. In this instance, in my opinion, given her treatment of OP, she's TA.", "I agree with this. Weddings generally trump birthdays and I can see a close friend being sad about their friend not prioritizing her wedding but Jess hasn\u2019t prioritized the friendship. \n\nJust as an aside, my sister\u2019s birthday is in late October which seems to be a heavy wedding time. One year she went to THREE weddings on her birthday, bridesmaid in one of them. And I don\u2019t think it was the first time she\u2019d attended a wedding on her birthday. After that year she said she\u2019s never going to a wedding on her birthday ever again and people could just deal with it. No idea if it\u2019s come up other than a cousin\u2019s daughter, but she was happy to say congrats, I won\u2019t be there on that one.", "Because many weddings venues have only a select few dates available in a given year?", "And what OP is doing over her special date.", "Okay? then it really shouldn't matter if OP is there or not if she wasn't thinking about her, thus making OP NTA \ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70", "And her birthday is more important than her friend's wedding, especially if the bride is going to act so nonchalant about it. That's OP's right to think so, and it doesn't make her TA.", "What friend? Even before this happened,  it sounded like Bride decided OP wasn't a friend anymore. If the only way I'm getting details about your wedding is from social media, you're an acquaintance or relative. I expect friendships to involve things like texts, phone calls, the occasional dimner/spa day.", "Of course!  If op wants to travel she should travel. But she seems to have unreasonable expectations that the wedding should have been planned around her birthday and that Jess owed her a text for not making her a bridesmaid.\n\nYour comment also seems to imply that the wedding should have been planned around op's birthday.", "My apologies. I don't use Instagram so it sounded like the reposted story would be generally available, or at least available to all of the bride's friends and family.", "Yes the bride is!  In case it wasn\u2019t clear, OP is NTA. I was a bride once too. I wanted specific dresses and colors for the bridesmaids so I bought them. I ended up changing my wedding date because one of his family members decided on that date after we did, but it was better his family not have to choose one or the other. If it was that good of a friend, you would know the birthday and what she had planned for years from the sounds of it. And the bride did know and is still butt hurt that she didn\u2019t rearrange her life for the bride. Not really that good of a friend to OP after all!", "And you have to consider special dates and other circumstances for lots of people, including two families.", "I was referring to the comment OP would be an Ah if they were close friends (for not going to the wedding but proceeding with her birthday plans).", "OP is being petty.... The wedding is more than a year away (she says she's 28, and the wedding is booked on her 30th), and she doesn't even have anything booked for birthday! I don't think OP is AH, but I don't think bride is either.\n\nNAH", "OP has every right to think her birthday is more important than her friends wedding, and I have every right to think OP is immature for feeling that way.", "It's low key kinda cringe she even messaged her when the wedding is over a year away, no invites yet, and they haven't spoken, but twice in a year..like I wouldn't have assumed so quickly I would even be invited..I mean, if you have only spoke twice in the past year then how do you know you will even be speaking at all by the time the invites go out? It's sad, but friendships fizzle out..not every friendship is a 4lifer. \nShe went out of her way to message her after seeing a date on SOMEONE ELSES instagram..like \"hey, I can't come..just so you know..I can't come..in case you were planning on inviting me..dont. cause I can't come..\" idk..it seems like OP may subconsciously be trying to grip at straws to still call this friendship a friendship when it sounds like it ended awhile ago. :/", "OP has said in other comments that she only mentioned the bridesmaid thing in the post to emphasize the level of closeness she thought her and Jess were\n\nJess knew in advance when OP's birthday was, that it's a milestone birthday, and that OP had plans to travel for it\n\nJess still chose OP's birthday as the date for the wedding and did not say anything about it to OP, only going \"yeah we haven't sent out invites yet but I was figuring you could get it off work\" when OP reached out to say \"oh good you guys made more plans!\"\n\nJess is completely ignoring the fact that it will be OP's birthday - Jess is not only expecting her to cancel her birthday plans for the wedding but is also expecting her to not care about having to do that for some reason.\n\nIt should have been simple, when Jess realized that the only date that would work for the wedding was also on OP's birthday, Jess should've reached out to see if OP would still be attending or if she'd be going through with her birthday plans or not. To not even reach out to OP when Jess knows that she just booked the wedding on OP's birthday, and then respond with a flippant \"I figured you could get it off work\" when OP reaches out herself, is weird to me.\n\n  \nEdited to add: They have been friends for 5 years, this is not some stranger +1 that's been invited - this is Jess's friend. Granted, OP may have misconstrued the bond that they supposedly had, but still.", "No worries!  I think stories indeed are public, but replies to them are private, or at least this is the way how mine and my friends\u201d replies are. Never seen comments to anyone\u2019s story(as opposed to post)", "No \u201clow-key\u201d about it. It\u2019s fully cringe.", "I didn't mention the bridesmaid thing in this reply and Op said she expected a text. Also just because Jess is one of op's closest friends, that doesn't automatically mean op is one of Jess's closest friends. \n\nYep. Jess is allowed to pick op's birthday! Like I said, not even a blip on the radar in terms of planning a wedding. Your birthday is only important to you and your immediate family. Even milestone birthdays. (You general here, not you in particular) Jess is allowed to ignore op's milestone birthday when planning her wedding. \n\nJess has not invited anyone yet. Once op gets the invitation, she can decline. Jess is not required to inform op above and beyond anyone else because op is not a main character in Jess's wedding.\n\nEdit: to be clear, Jess's ultimatum was not cool. But planning it on op's birthday is totally fine."]}
