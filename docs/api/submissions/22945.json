We don\u2019t live together and she lives in an apartment so we usually host these dinners at my place. In addition to the regular group, she invited a friend she made at work. While our friends group is quite diverse, her work friend is the first Thai person to join the group so we were all excited about the potluck she would be bringing.\n\nWhen everyone was there, we started to heat up the various potluck dishes then sat down for dinner. Everything was great and the conversation was lively. GF\u2019s work friend said that she brought a sticky doron rice dessert (not sure I spelled it correctly, I sounded it out). I was very excited because I love desserts and love trying new food. Toward turn end of the meal, the people who brought desserts brought them out. \n\nWhen her work friend opened her container, there was an overwhelming odor that hit everyone at once. Some of the people who sat closest to the container covered their nose and some of the people who were still eating gagged. My best friend choked and cough so hard she had to run to the bathroom. I told my GF\u2019s work friend I think her dessert went bad and she tasted it and said that it was fine. She said the smell can be different but it\u2019ll turn sweet once it airs out. \n\nShe was wrong.\n\nIt got worse and worse to the point most everyone was standing in the opposite end of the room as far away from her desert as possible. I suggested she take her dessert out to the porch and whoever wants it can go out there and get it. My GF jumped to her friends defense and tried to get me to shut up all the while holding her finger under her nose to keep from smelling the odor. After a few minutes, I couldn\u2019t take the odor anymore so I got up and moved the dish out to the porch.\n\nThis embarrassed the friend so she left. My GF yelled at me in front of everyone and told me I was being dramatic and culturally insensitive. I argued it was smelling up my house. She demanded I try the desert before I say anything but I told her I\u2019m not eating anything that smells like that.\n\nI might have embarrassed her friend but I think I was justified in moving the dish that the smell still lingers in my house this morning.

Why you'd bring that to a potluck cultural dish or not I don't know.", "NTA \nDurian isn't allowed in hotels etc for this reason. You can literally get kicked out if you bring it back. Everyone knows the smell is offensive and she shouldn't have brought it to the party.", "If you\u2019re talking about durian, then NTA.\n\nI\u2019ve traveled all over the world and have elite status with several hotel chains. I\u2019ve only witnessed one person ever being kicked out of a hotel and it was in Vietnam. \n\nA Vietnamese lady brought a bag of durians into the hotel and the lobby staff stopped her. They argued for a bit then physically moved her outside.\n\nIn a country where the durian is eaten, they didn\u2019t allow it in the hotel.", "NTA. If everyone attending the party can't stand the smell and some even had to gag then the desert has an unpalatable smell and it's reasonable to request that it's moved outside.\n\nSurstr\u00f6mming is a Swedish fish dish with a rancid smell (so I have been told) and I bet every cuisine has something that smells horrible to people not used to it. It's not culturally insensitive to want to ensure the majority of your guests are comfortable at the party you are hosting even if that means that some dishes may need to be covered, or stored outside. I am a foreigner in my current country. I can't imagine bringing something to a party that then stinks up the place so bad that people are gagging. I'd be fine to then move the dish outside because I wouldn't want others to have a bad time because of the smell of my dish.", "What is up with a new potluck AITA story every other day?\n\nOn a side note, i 100% do not believe she brought durian the first time she visited a new group of people.", "NTA, and to be honest, there is absolutely no way this colleague didn\u2019t know how offensive the smell of durian is. She may like durian, but even in Thailand you can\u2019t take it on public transport and into hotels because of the smell. I don\u2019t believe for a second she was confused about what people were objecting to. My guess is she thought she\u2019d have a bit of fun getting you all to try durian, but it backfired. She absolutely should have informed the group what she was doing and asked permission first. \n\nYou weren\u2019t being culturally insensitive, btw. I live in SEA and everyone stores their durians outside because they don\u2019t want the smell inside. Your gfs colleague should be apologising for not warning you all first.", "NTA\nThe fruit was Durian. And there\u2019s no doubt the person who brought it knew that it stinks and that people who are not accustomed to it find the stink overwhelming. I can\u2019t imagine why she would have brought Durian to a party, unless she did it as some kind of a cruel joke. Cultural sensitivity has its limits. When everyone is gagging and trying not to vomit is one of them.", "Durian is a fruit from southeast Asia, about the size of a melon with a thorny rind, and notable for its potent smell. The durian's smell has been compared to smelly gym clothes, rotting meat, and even raw sewage. -Indian Public Media\n\nAnthony Bourdain once said that after eating durian, \u201cYour breath will smell as if you\u2019d been French-kissing your dead grandmother.\u201d Countries where it's commonly found have banned it from public spaces, as even just a single fruit can turn the air within entire hotels and airports rancid. - USA Today 10 Best\n\nNTA!", "Ok we don\u2019t think this happened right?  Like this one has to be too far.", "NTA\n\nThe good ol' durian attack.  It stinks but it tastes wonderful. It stinks so much it's illegal to grow in your backyard in some places, not allowed to take it on public transport, things like that.  It's a menace.  The only reason we allow it to exist is because it's quite nice to eat.", "NTA. The coworker made a super bad choice as Durian definitely isn\u2019t for most people and it reeks.
