We don\u2019t live together and she lives in an apartment so we usually host these dinners at my place. In addition to the regular group, she invited a friend she made at work. While our friends group is quite diverse, her work friend is the first Thai person to join the group so we were all excited about the potluck she would be bringing.\n\nWhen everyone was there, we started to heat up the various potluck dishes then sat down for dinner. Everything was great and the conversation was lively. GF\u2019s work friend said that she brought a sticky doron rice dessert (not sure I spelled it correctly, I sounded it out). I was very excited because I love desserts and love trying new food. Toward turn end of the meal, the people who brought desserts brought them out. \n\nWhen her work friend opened her container, there was an overwhelming odor that hit everyone at once. Some of the people who sat closest to the container covered their nose and some of the people who were still eating gagged. My best friend choked and cough so hard she had to run to the bathroom. I told my GF\u2019s work friend I think her dessert went bad and she tasted it and said that it was fine. She said the smell can be different but it\u2019ll turn sweet once it airs out. \n\nShe was wrong.\n\nIt got worse and worse to the point most everyone was standing in the opposite end of the room as far away from her desert as possible. I suggested she take her dessert out to the porch and whoever wants it can go out there and get it. My GF jumped to her friends defense and tried to get me to shut up all the while holding her finger under her nose to keep from smelling the odor. After a few minutes, I couldn\u2019t take the odor anymore so I got up and moved the dish out to the porch.\n\nThis embarrassed the friend so she left. My GF yelled at me in front of everyone and told me I was being dramatic and culturally insensitive. I argued it was smelling up my house. She demanded I try the desert before I say anything but I told her I\u2019m not eating anything that smells like that.\n\nI might have embarrassed her friend but I think I was justified in moving the dish that the smell still lingers in my house this morning.
