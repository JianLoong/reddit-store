We\u2019ve been through a lot together, and it\u2019s been really hard at times. As of yesterday, my fianc\u00e9 got a job interview across town, but we only have one car that I\u2019m taking to get to this trip.\nI\u2019ve bought him a weekly bus ticket and a bike to try and help him get to places while I\u2019m gone. I\u2019m leaving one day early so I can get familiar with the area because it\u2019s a big city that I\u2019m going to be alone in. It\u2019s a two week program, and the majority of the time I\u2019m going to different places all around the city.\n\nNow, we are up at 5 am arguing because he feels as if getting on a bus and being taken home by our neighbor is too much of a hassle and would rather me delay my trip so I can help. The thing is, I\u2019ve been doing nothing but helping for the past six years, and when I finally am doing something good for myself, he makes me feel guilty for it. I love him very much, but he is a very miserable person sometimes. He has anger problems that are hard to deal with, and I\u2019ve had to put a lot of things on hold because there\u2019s a lot going on.\n\nI just don\u2019t know what to do.

Get out while you still can.", "Thank you all for your advice. I\u2019m going to take these two weeks to further my education and take the time to think about our relationship.", " NTA.  Leave, do your program.  Spend the two weeks making a list of pros and cons concerning your relationship.  Not everything is forever, yours might have reached its expiration date.", "I know what you should do!\n\n*Go on your trip*\n\nHe is a big boy and can figure out how to ride a bus\n\nAnd something else you should do is find a better boyfriend, this one is selfish\n\nNTA", "NTA and to be frank, you sound unhappy with this relationship. He can\u2019t even deal with a job interview himself? You had to buy his bus ticket? And according to your post, you\u2019re always the one helping him with everything.\nBased on your comment that he isn\u2019t the same man you met 6 years ago - rethink if this is what you want from a partner and if you really want to marry him.", "You need to have a grown up talk. \n\nHe needs to know that you\u2019re trying to make things better for BOTH of you. He needs to know that you expect him to do the SAME - that means, go to a lot of job interviews until he gets a job. That also means, you will be busy and he needs to take care of himself - public transport, taxi, Uber whatever. \n\nBe clear to him that what you don\u2019t want is both of you suffering in the long run just because you both couldn\u2019t take care of their own career, being childish about \u201cnot getting support\u201d and as a result holding each other back. Say you\u2019re happy to support him in his career but not at the expense of yours. It\u2019s asking him indirectly to man up.", "NTA and the closing paragraph removes absolutely any chance of a N A H ruling.  Honestly, given his past behavior and current pouting it sounds like he is in someway jealous of you for your trip and trying to sabotage it.  It also sounds like this isn't thr first time.\n\nStand firm and take your trip OP.  While away, note how he acts and seriously evaluate if this is someone you want to marry.  Are you confident tying your life and finances to them?  Potentially raising children?  Being partners?", "NTA, OP stand your ground with this one. It's not that he has no other options, he just prefers one over the other, but the one he prefers is at your expense while the one you prefer doesn't harm him in any way he just likes it less.", "Info: \n\nSo you have an out of town, multiple-day, multi-location, packed itinerary trip and all he has to do is show up for one interview in the town where you live? \n\nWhose car is it and who is paying for it?", "Stand your ground and take your trip. NTA. If he wants this job, he can get himself there on time, with or without you. He's a grown-ass dude.", "NTA but I think you really need relationship advice rather than a AITA judgement", "NTA but why are you with him? He seems lazy and entitled.", "Is your partner mentally disabled? If not, I can\u2019t see a reason why he can\u2019t catch a bus. If catching it for an interview is too much, how on earth is he going to cope with an actual job?\n\nNTA. Enjoy your course!!!", "NTA. Tell him to call a cab or Uber.", "NTA...Do what is right and correct for \\*you\\*. You sound like you have done enough for him. If he resists, starts fighting about it, doesn't respond in any other way than what is helpful to you: Broom him. If he really cared for you, you wouldn't be encountering this resistance. If he is not supportive: find someone who is.", "go on your trip guilt free seriously it sounds like he has also jealousy issues with what ur doing.  and while ur away take some time too reflect if this is how u want to spend the rest of your life dealing with that constant behaviour of his.", "NTA. Take the car and go for the trip. Don't let him guilt you into delaying your trip, you've already helped by getting him a bus ticket and bike. Prioritise your career and future. Also rethink marrying this man. I don't know much about your relationship but from the little you're sharing here i\u2019d seriously reconsider things.", "NTA. I used to take buses and trains by myself all the time by the time I was 14. Tell him to go to the store, find the biggest straw they have and suck it the fuck up.", "NTA\n\nYour bf may be dealing with the fact that he is not a contributor to the family and that could be where his angst lays, just an option. But regardless, you have this out of town deal going on and its YOUR deal.  \n\nLike I said, his misery and anger may come from what I described above UNLESS he is putting hands on you or berating you and being verbally abusive.  Now that is a completely different area.  \n\nRegardless, you need to take this out of town trip for a couple reasons. 1) you need a break and 2) once you are away from his influence you will have a clearer head and think more rationally.  You may be surprised at what you see when your bf isnt there to make you feel guilty.\n\nINFO - When you say youve been \"through a lot together\", is that dealing with his issues or just issues in general?", "NTA.  Look at this with an open eye.  F rejects you prioritizing anything but him.  F is unwilling to compromise on this small thing.  F is unwilling to take the actions needed to get to a job interview. You had to help F to get a bus pass and bike.  F shames you for not doing what he demands.   F will never let you forget doing this.  F is waiving two handfuls of red flags.  Seems like it\u2019s time to stop going down his road and instead to find your own new way.", "Nta your being manipulated and should probably run. I'm sorry to be that blunt. You have tried a bus pass and a bike is more than enough to get to any interview or job.  If they were serious but they are literally finding any excuse and since they are job less I'm assuming they have been and you support the house hold. So take your time enjoy the trip focus on making your situation better especially since you are already so invested in this trip. Your time and money is already spent don't let them waste it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

However, it sounds like he is just lazy and doesn't want the inconvenience. He sounds like a bad time tbh", "Yes so please look at him as the man he is now not the person he used to be.
