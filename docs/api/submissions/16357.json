John has one son Tristan (5m) from his previous marriage. Tristan and his mum moved a two hours drive away, we are still in contact and I see him from time to time.\n\nSo a few days ago, someone was knocking on my door. A young woman (30ishf) was standing there, wanted to confirm if I am John's mother. She then told me that she and John have a two year old son Elias together. I was very shocked (and still am) by this. She was really nice and we talked for a bit. It seems like her and John dated for a short time (he was already divorced when they met) and she got pregnant by accident. Despite John wanting nothing to do with the child she decided to keep it. John doesn't play an active part, she told me he has only seen his son once in those two years. He only pays child support as I can only guess she would take him to court otherwise. She told me she wanted to let me know that if I am ever interested I can meet my grandson but that for now she would give me some time and space to think about it. She left and I immediately contacted John. He seemed pretty angry, but didn't deny that he has a son. He told me that he wants nothing to do with him and I shouldn't meet him. This is where I am might be the asshole. I have seen pictures of Elias and his mum described him as a lovely boy. We all live in the same city and I would love to meet him. I am feeling ashamed that my son is such a deadbeat father especially since his own father wasn't very present in his own life.

You are that child's biological grandmother.  His mother is inviting you to develop your own relationship with him. You have every right to ignore the wishes of his absent father and to develop that relationship.  \n\nThere are many reasons for doing so.  Your relationship with him gives him another biological family member to love him and who he can come to trust. Your developing a relationship also will give him access to your family's medical history, which seems to be an increasingly important piece of information in today's world.  Over time, he may/will meet others on your side of family because you broke through and allowed him to get to know you. \n\nJust like his mother, acting as the adult she is, ignored your son and reached out directly to you (and I'll guess it's because your grandson is asking about his father), you should ignore your son and reach out to your grandson.  And while you're at, thank his mother.", "NTA. Your son is a deadbeat, but it doesn't mean you have to be absent from Elias' life. In fact, the poor kid will feel much better having at least some connection to his father's family in the form of his grandma. Go, meet Elias, be as involved in the kid's life as his mother lets you, and shame on your son for abandoning his kid.", "NTA! Your grandson deserves to have his grandma around. Your son might not want to be in his life, but that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t. You could explain to your son that you wanting to be around your own grandson doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re forcing him to be a dad. It sounds like he is angry because he feels guilty for not stepping up\u2026 but he\u2019s an adult and he gets to make his own decisions, even if they are poor decisions. You get to make your own decisions too.", "NTA\n\nYou have a right to have your own relationship with the kid and it will definitely make Elias' life better. It will definitely complicate yours, though, but imo it's your son's fault. Accident or no that kid is his son.", "YTA. The girl kept the child despite Johns wishes and thats fine, he even pays child support. Now she is trying to use you to get back into Johns life and you are assisting her that makes both of you TA.", "NTA. It's beautiful she offered you to know your grandson and it's so nice that you want to be a positive presence in his life in place his father \n\nSorry but you're right that your son is a deadbeat. What a jerk.", "NTA, and Elias has a right to know and love his grandma. His mom wants you in his life, and you want to be in his life. Your son doesn't get to ruin that relationship for you and him.", "NTA. the more people who are present and loving in a child's life, the better.

Good on you, grandma. <3", "NTA\n\nIf John doesn't want to see him, that's his choice.  However, he doesn't get to gatekeep you from the baby.  If the mom wants a grandparent in the baby's life, and you want to visit, that's your choice.", "NTA,\nYour son has decided that he wants nothing to do with his child. It's a really shitty thing for him to do, but at the end of the day he's made his decision. Though, he can't decide for you. \nThe child's mother has given you an invitation. She is much more that child's parent than your son is. Your grandson will be extremely lucky to have such a loving grandmother being apart of his life", "NTA. Just because your son acted like an asshole need you have to act like one too. You have a grandson, you want to meet him, and his mom want you in his life, so it's not your son's decision to make.", "Of course you should see your grandson if the only barrier is your son's disapproval. (Which is probably based on his own guilt.) I would talk to John in more detail about *why* he doesn't want anything to do with this child, especially if he's a good father to the older child. There may be information you need to know (for example, if this woman is a liar or manipulative or a thief).\n\nYWNBTA if you contacted Elias. He will be lucky to have a loving grandma in his life.", "NTA. But best talk to your son about it. It is his choice not to be involved in his son's live. Maybe tell him, he doesn't have to be, but you want to be involved in your grandchilds live. And that the two of them don't have to see each other (and keep this promise). To avoid drama it would best be like that. You can't force your son to be involved in his childs live. ut it is okay, if you want to be. \n\nMaybe also ask him, if he has done a DNA test if the child is really his - just to be sure.", "True, although if he pays child support thats not a deadbeat", "People make babies by mistake sometimes. If you are having sex (which most of us do), even if you are taking every precaution, it\u2019s still a risk you run, and a baby is one of the possible outcomes. He knew he was taking a slight risk when he had sex. And what do you mean \u201ceven pays child support\u201d like that\u2019s some big favor to pay for your own child. You are so far off base you aren\u2019t even on the field.", "Thank you. She actually told me she is fine with John's choice of not wanting to be involved and that we don't need to discuss John in any way as it's a separate topic for her. She even said she doesn't want to badmouth him just explaning why he never told me about my grandson.", "At the end of the day he is my son and I don't want to loose him over this. But I really asking myself if I raised him the wrong way. He seems like a caring and loving father to Tristan, so I don't his behavior towards his other son.", "Thank you. I am afraid that my son would cut me out of his life when I go ahead and meet my grandson.", "Thank you. Despite being very disappointed I wouldn't push him for relationship. Elias mum reminded me a bit of myself. I also immigrated to this country and had no family support with raising my children.", "Thank you. He said that Elias isn't part of our family. He was very anry on the phone and yelling that I should stay away.", "Thank you. There was a DNA test taken, Elias is his son for sure.", "That may be a choice you have to make. But first ask him why he's so adamant about this. There may be information you need to keep yourself safe.", "From what I understood from both sides is that he wanted her to get rid of the child and he is still angry she didn't went through with it. And since she made that decision he's still mad as he never wanted this child.", "NTA. John doesn't have to be involved in the child's life if he doesn't want to (beyond providing financial support), but he cannot forbid you from being so, if the child's mother invites you in.\n\nIt's really lovely that she approached you, and I hope you do go ahead and meet Elias. A little boy having another person in his life who loves him can only be a good thing.", "First of all your son is not a deadbeat. He pays child support, but has no emotional connection and did not want the child. Men do not have reproductive choice during pregnancy, so limiting his involvement to child support is a fair course of action.\n\nYWNBTA for having a different set of values and deciding you have a stake in the child's best interests and thinking it's a good idea to have contact and following up.", "1st paternity test. You don't want to love this child then find out he isn't your grandkid", "NTA, despite what happened between your son and his ex gf, your grandson is innocent. He didn\u2019t choose to be born. Ask your son why he wants to punish an innocent child? Stick up for your grandson!", "As the son of a deadbeat dad myself, I\u2019d have loved a relationship with a loving grandparent regardless of whether my dad had wanted me to see them or not. Unfortunately my grandad died when I was very young so I didn\u2019t get that. NTA. Go for it.", "NTA. You have a right to see your grandson. I suspect John is unhappy with this arrangement because he likely prefers to compartmentalize his two realities- this son he views as a mistake that he ignores, from his family. You being involved prevents him from doing that. But that's his problem, maybe this will give him the wake up call he needs.", "NTA.\nYour relationship with your son is separate from the relationship you want with your grandson. It wouldn't be if he were involved but he's chosen to tread the deadbeat path so, realistically speaking, he doesn't have a deciding vote in this manner. \n\nMeet your grandson. Spoil him and let him know he's loved. If your son has a problem with that, he should do some serious introspection.", "NTA - If you have to choose between the two your best investment is in your grandchild, not your son. The child is innocent, while your son is a deadbeat jerk trying to make demands of everyone, including you. He is purposely alienating his own child.  \nUnless you raised him to be this way, his loss at you having a lifelong relation ship with your own grandchild is a fair tradeoff, frankly.\n\n(I said this down below in a comment but wanted a vote so... repeat :p)", "NTA, You are a decent bloke, I hope you can find the peace and balance you need.", "NTA but your deadbeat son sure is. I\u2019m so sorry.", "NTA .... You have the right to choose if you want to be a part of your grandson's life and it's great that you do.... You do not have the right to force your son to be. Keep that in mind when you decide to move forward and don't essentially flood your interactions wroth your son with things about your grandson. \n\nYou do not know the circumstances of their relationship. If he made it known he didn't want more kids, used a condom and the BC failed etc; he expressed not wanting anything to do with son; SHE chose to keep him so she responsible for him. That doesn't make him a dead beat dad. He had a choice just like she did; he chose to walk away; that's his right. \n\nThis coming from me having 2 kids (im a woman) my first was planned and wanted while heartedly by both parties; now that we're divorced we share 50/50 in custody and financial responsibility. My second was unplanned. I was told I was infertile and BC failed. He never voiced wanting children. I have him the out to walk away because I wanted to keep my son regardless. That would mean no shared custody or visitation and no financial responsibility for him. He chose to stay and we've been together for 4 years.", "You have every right to be involved in that little boy's life.  Just because your son sucks, doesn't mean you have to suffer.  NTA", "NTA, but your son sure is. If he was divorced when he fathered his second child, it means he had a child with his ex-wife and then left when the child was 2 years old? Then, he immediately had another child, which he abandoned even faster than the first one? It's an embarrassment.", "NTA. Your son is an adult and can make his own choices, as shitty as they are. However, the same applies to you. You can choose to do what you want and if John doesn't like it he can kick rocks.v", "NTA  It's horribly unfair to mistreat a child just because his birth wasn't planned.  And he is mistreating him by not being his father in truth.  You want to be involved in his life, so do it.  Your son will get over it unless he's a complete loser.  Either way, this innocent child needs a grandmother in his life.   Enjoy him.", "NTA.  John can make his own decisions, right or wrong, regarding his relationship with his child but he can't dictate your relationship with your grandchild.", "As a grandma myself, I would 100% be in that child\u2019s life.", "NAH - I don't think you would be a jerk for wanting to see your grandson. But your son also has a right to not see the child if that was not what he was planning in life.\n\nAlong with, you say how he was yelling about the child not being part of the family. This seems really over the top for this. Have you talked to him about this woman and what she may have done to cause him to be that upset? It sounds like there may be more to the story. It seems like there may have been abuse towards your son done by this woman, and in that case I understand why he could be so angry. At least try to find out what caused him to be upset before you see the child.", "NTA. It sounds like you would be a lovely addition to the little boy's life.", "Info: sorry it just sounds like there\u2019s more going on here. When they were dating did they discuss children? Was it a situation where this accident happened because of birth control failure and she changed her mind about termination? Are you certain she didn\u2019t try to baby trap him?", "Agreed. NTA. You have more responsibility to a child and less to the asshole 40 year old deadbeat dad.", "But we don't know why he doesn't want the child. The son seems really upset and over the top about this woman. There is no real reason to be that angry unless she had done something to him. And if that is the case, I don't think I can label him a jerk for that", "But how is it a really shitty thing to do? Women have the unanimous decision to have an abortion. If they don\u2019t want a child and undertake one, is that shitty? Why is it women can decided \u2018whoops, not this time!\u2019 but men can\u2019t? (Not inviting an abortion debate here). He\u2019s still financially providing, he\u2019s doing what\u2019s required. He just doesn\u2019t want another child.", "Thank you. My son said he never wanted this child along other things like thow he isn't part of our family. But he made that decision for the rest of the family.\n\nI should also point out that I asked Elias mum if she needs/wants money and she told me no, that she only would like to give her son the opportunity to have someone from his paternal family in his life.\n\nJohn is involved in Tristan's life and sees him on a regular base and is there for all important milestones (birthdays, christmas etc.).", "But how does that promise work? Grandmas birthday comes up, she invites her grandchildren. So now son can\u2019t go? Son can\u2019t go to Christmas? To Easter? All the kids make friends at Grandma\u2019s birthday party, now son can\u2019t go to his other child\u2019s birthday party because the other kid will be there. Be realistic. That promise just won\u2019t work.", "He pays child support, not a deadbeat.", "If you have to choose between the two your best investment is in your grandchild, not your son.

He is purposely alienating his own child.\n\nUnless you raised him to be this way, his loss at you having a lifelong relation ship with your own grandchild is a fair tradeoff, frankly.", "Find out if there\u2019s a reason. Maybe the woman hurt him in some way? Maybe she lied about using birth control and betrayed him.", "Thank you. Where we live fathers can be forced by the state to pay child support. It sounded like John is only paying because he has to (at least he made it sound like it).", "I didn't mean to sound like i think paying child support is a huge favour. Its the baseline of something you do in this situation, at least he does that. There are people who, you know, don't.", "Even if she lied about birth control, the baby is innocent and shouldn\u2019t be punished. OP is still his grandma either way.", "I agree, but it would explain it and would help her not see her son as a bad person", "Then he has to deal with the consequences. \n\nMan + woman + no contraception + sex = very high likelihood of pregnancy\n\nIf he didn't want a kid, he should have rubbered up. \n\nI can understand your reticence but Elias's mum was very kind in offering you the opportunity to get to know your grandson, seemingly without wanting or demanding anything in return other than your presence in his life.\n\nPerhaps if your son had been part of Elias's life, she may never have felt the need to contact you. \n\nLike it or not, Elias ***is*** part of your family. Half his DNA belongs to your son\n\nYou have a delicate path to tread but imagine being Elias as an older child when his mum tells him that neither his father nor his grandmother wanted anything to do with him despite being given ample opportunity.\n\nNTA for wanting to meet him but your son is an absolute horror of a man for a) being himself absent and b) insisting that you do the same. A complete lack of basic humanity. Vile", "If he never wanted a child he should have taken many steps to avoid getting someone pregnant, not expect them to kill a child growing inside of them. He should have used condoms and made sure she had a pill or IUD, or you know, he should have kept his legs closed.", "my sister got pregnant on BC, used a condom, and he pulled out. things happen", "he made himself clear that he wants nothing to do with child, just like women have the choice to abort it or keep it, he made the choice to abort it, she didn\u2019t want that, so he made it clear if she keeps it he wants nothing to do with it. and that\u2019s okay too", "If all those things are actually true (and bc used properly, and condom used properly) then that must be like 1 in a million odds."]}
