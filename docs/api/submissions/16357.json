John has one son Tristan (5m) from his previous marriage. Tristan and his mum moved a two hours drive away, we are still in contact and I see him from time to time.\n\nSo a few days ago, someone was knocking on my door. A young woman (30ishf) was standing there, wanted to confirm if I am John's mother. She then told me that she and John have a two year old son Elias together. I was very shocked (and still am) by this. She was really nice and we talked for a bit. It seems like her and John dated for a short time (he was already divorced when they met) and she got pregnant by accident. Despite John wanting nothing to do with the child she decided to keep it. John doesn't play an active part, she told me he has only seen his son once in those two years. He only pays child support as I can only guess she would take him to court otherwise. She told me she wanted to let me know that if I am ever interested I can meet my grandson but that for now she would give me some time and space to think about it. She left and I immediately contacted John. He seemed pretty angry, but didn't deny that he has a son. He told me that he wants nothing to do with him and I shouldn't meet him. This is where I am might be the asshole. I have seen pictures of Elias and his mum described him as a lovely boy. We all live in the same city and I would love to meet him. I am feeling ashamed that my son is such a deadbeat father especially since his own father wasn't very present in his own life.

You are that child's biological grandmother.  His mother is inviting you to develop your own relationship with him. You have every right to ignore the wishes of his absent father and to develop that relationship.  \n\nThere are many reasons for doing so.  Your relationship with him gives him another biological family member to love him and who he can come to trust. Your developing a relationship also will give him access to your family's medical history, which seems to be an increasingly important piece of information in today's world.  Over time, he may/will meet others on your side of family because you broke through and allowed him to get to know you. \n\nJust like his mother, acting as the adult she is, ignored your son and reached out directly to you (and I'll guess it's because your grandson is asking about his father), you should ignore your son and reach out to your grandson.  And while you're at, thank his mother.", "NTA. Your son is a deadbeat, but it doesn't mean you have to be absent from Elias' life. In fact, the poor kid will feel much better having at least some connection to his father's family in the form of his grandma. Go, meet Elias, be as involved in the kid's life as his mother lets you, and shame on your son for abandoning his kid.", "NTA! Your grandson deserves to have his grandma around. Your son might not want to be in his life, but that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t. You could explain to your son that you wanting to be around your own grandson doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re forcing him to be a dad. It sounds like he is angry because he feels guilty for not stepping up\u2026 but he\u2019s an adult and he gets to make his own decisions, even if they are poor decisions. You get to make your own decisions too.", "NTA\n\nYou have a right to have your own relationship with the kid and it will definitely make Elias' life better. It will definitely complicate yours, though, but imo it's your son's fault. Accident or no that kid is his son.", "YTA. The girl kept the child despite Johns wishes and thats fine, he even pays child support. Now she is trying to use you to get back into Johns life and you are assisting her that makes both of you TA.", "NTA. It's beautiful she offered you to know your grandson and it's so nice that you want to be a positive presence in his life in place his father \n\nSorry but you're right that your son is a deadbeat. What a jerk.", "NTA, and Elias has a right to know and love his grandma. His mom wants you in his life, and you want to be in his life. Your son doesn't get to ruin that relationship for you and him.", "NTA. the more people who are present and loving in a child's life, the better. But try to keep your relationship/contact with your grandson completely separate from your relationship with your son. I don't mean lie about it, I just mean don't force any involvement either way if you can help it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Good on you, grandma. <3", "NTA\n\nIf John doesn't want to see him, that's his choice.  However, he doesn't get to gatekeep you from the baby.  If the mom wants a grandparent in the baby's life, and you want to visit, that's your choice.", "NTA,\nYour son has decided that he wants nothing to do with his child. It's a really shitty thing for him to do, but at the end of the day he's made his decision. Though, he can't decide for you. \nThe child's mother has given you an invitation. She is much more that child's parent than your son is. Your grandson will be extremely lucky to have such a loving grandmother being apart of his life", "NTA. Just because your son acted like an asshole need you have to act like one too. You have a grandson, you want to meet him, and his mom want you in his life, so it's not your son's decision to make.", "Of course you should see your grandson if the only barrier is your son's disapproval. (Which is probably based on his own guilt.) I would talk to John in more detail about *why* he doesn't want anything to do with this child, especially if he's a good father to the older child. There may be information you need to know (for example, if this woman is a liar or manipulative or a thief).\n\nYWNBTA if you contacted Elias. He will be lucky to have a loving grandma in his life.", "NTA. But best talk to your son about it. It is his choice not to be involved in his son's live. Maybe tell him, he doesn't have to be, but you want to be involved in your grandchilds live. And that the two of them don't have to see each other (and keep this promise). To avoid drama it would best be like that. You can't force your son to be involved in his childs live. ut it is okay, if you want to be. \n\nMaybe also ask him, if he has done a DNA test if the child is really his - just to be sure.", "True, although if he pays child support thats not a deadbeat", "People make babies by mistake sometimes. If you are having sex (which most of us do), even if you are taking every precaution, it\u2019s still a risk you run, and a baby is one of the possible outcomes. He knew he was taking a slight risk when he had sex. And what do you mean \u201ceven pays child support\u201d like that\u2019s some big favor to pay for your own child. You are so far off base you aren\u2019t even on the field.", "Thank you. She actually told me she is fine with John's choice of not wanting to be involved and that we don't need to discuss John in any way as it's a separate topic for her. She even said she doesn't want to badmouth him just explaning why he never told me about my grandson.", "At the end of the day he is my son and I don't want to loose him over this. But I really asking myself if I raised him the wrong way. He seems like a caring and loving father to Tristan, so I don't his behavior towards his other son.", "Thank you. I am afraid that my son would cut me out of his life when I go ahead and meet my grandson.", "Thank you. Despite being very disappointed I wouldn't push him for relationship. Elias mum reminded me a bit of myself. I also immigrated to this country and had no family support with raising my children.", "Thank you. He said that Elias isn't part of our family. He was very anry on the phone and yelling that I should stay away.", "Thank you. There was a DNA test taken, Elias is his son for sure.", "That may be a choice you have to make. But first ask him why he's so adamant about this. There may be information you need to keep yourself safe.", "From what I understood from both sides is that he wanted her to get rid of the child and he is still angry she didn't went through with it. And since she made that decision he's still mad as he never wanted this child."]}
