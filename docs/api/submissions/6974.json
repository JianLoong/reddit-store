There's nothing wrong with being introverted. However, shutting conversations down is a great way to keep abused children isolated and vulnerable. What if the daughter actually was being abused like 1 in 3 children do? Mommy's freakout just taught her to keep quiet.", "NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA", "NTA. If she had concerns she should've asked you about it! And just because your wife may be more introverted around your family doesn't mean that she doesn't love your daughter. Just because she doesn't show love in the way your mother expects doesn't mean it's not there at all.", "Ahaha\nEven mothers have to be put in their place, ffs.\n\nNTA", "NTA after 10 years your mom should know her well enough to know that's not the case and even if she had concerns she should have asked you first. Not go right for your daughter.", "NTA it is inappropriate for her to bring that up to her granddaughter. \nAlso none of her business. You did good standing up for your wife.\n\nBe prepared that she will probably do this to your daughter again.", "NTA, your mother may have adjusted the phrasing, but she was asking your daughter if she was being neglected at home. Your mother going to your child with an accusation of neglect is wrong. And you should look at the fact that your mother immediately called up your brothers and sisters to come in as her flying monkeys and take this as a point to put distance between yourself and your mother.\n\nYour mother entering your home and quizzing your child with an accusation toward your partner, and then calling in others to say that she's allowed to do that, is a reason to not have her near your child for a while. I would demand counseling sessions before allowing contact to resume since she is using proximity to your child to be inappropriate", "NTA. Coaching like that can put phrases in kids mouths that you don\u2019t want getting out. Your mom was basically trying to get your daughter to admit something is wrong with your spouse. As far as I\u2019m concerned your siblings can sod off until they learn respect in someone else\u2019s home", "NTA I see your mother has gone with the flying monkey approach. Kind of cliche don't you think?", "This right here, like she it was literally quizzing your daughter about whether or not she was being abused at home. Your mom is an asshole", "You think she had good intentions? She was quizzing a child about whether or not they were being abused because she doesn't respect her daughter's wife, and then called in reinforcements to lash out at the poster for telling her to leave.\n\nShe absolutely did not have good intentions accusing the poster's wife of child abuse, to her child", "Most of the time it\u2019s because person in the wrong goes around and tells a different version of events that paints OP as wrong.", "Yuuup, she called in the flying monkeys to bully the poster about defending their spouse in their own home. That's reason enough for Mom not to come over for a long time and have no contact with the grandbaby", "Kind of an ass. You didnt have to throw her out. Tell her what you said in this message and let it go.  And tell her not to put your daughter in that situation.\n\nIt's your mother and she was worried. Set her mind at ease and move on.", "YTA What did you expect? Look how your wife is around them. I understand why they were wondering if she\u2019s the same way when they\u2019re not around. She was probably worried about your daughter Thinking your wife was like that 24/7. \n\nYour wife needs to get help. Of course people are going to be worried if somebody is cold and rude whenever they\u2019re around them. \n\nIf you had a sister-in-law and brother-in-law that acted the way your wife does in public you would be wondering the same exact thing \n\nYou literally blew up on your mother over one little question.\n\nIf your mom noticed that your daughter is literally starting to act like her mother, then maybe you should start paying attention and get them both in therapy.", "I can see how the wording is confusing in the first part. The behavior is \"new\" in the child. The behavioral difference in the wife is that she's reserved in public and affectionate in private. If wife has never been affectionate in front of grandma, how is the grandma supposed to know that wife is affectionate towards daughter in private?\n\nIn the second part, I missed a word- it should be \"...didn't ask ABOUT you first\" as in grandma was doing a general check, not just targeting wife."]}
