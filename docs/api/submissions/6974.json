Unfortunately, your mother wanted your wife n your daughter to be more like her n you and show the emotions. If she wanted to see the emotions out in the open, she should not be surprised that you overreacted (in a way) and asked her to leave", "NTA but I wouldn\u2019t be too hard on your mom.

From another Italian, that also doesn't like being affectionate in public (or in private for that matter), I can understand both your viewpoints. Yes we're culturally extroverted and being an introvert is one whole kind of issue here. People can and do become annoying. Being withdrawn is quickly seen as a symptom of problems. But it sounds like your mom waited a bit to assess the situation before trying to investigate. I don't know what tone and words she actually used, but she might've decided to ask your kid directly without you around to have one honest answer and be done before asking you and having you talk with the kid. It sounds veeery annoying but it's also an effective way. Talk to her again and explain that it's just a cultural thing, and your daughter could also be showing her own character. As long as she comes to you when needed, there's no problem, and your mom's concern can be understood but is not necessary.", "Good intentions?
