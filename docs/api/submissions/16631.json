His funeral will be next weekend. My siblings and I have been making arrangements in our group chat.

Our brother (25m) hasn\u2019t involved himself apart from listing the things he wants to take from the flat. Since there is no will, we decided to split everything between the 3 of us.\n\nWe were on a video call this morning and were discussing decorations etc and where to host the funeral meal after the church. My brother then said he didn\u2019t care what we chose because he wouldn\u2019t attend anyway. My sister looked shocked and I told him he didn\u2019t really mean that. We had a fight. I called him selfish and disrespectful for not wanting to go.

It's an emotional time for all of you. But you need to accept that your brother can choose not to attend and he is not selfish for doing so.", "YTA it's his choice, you should indeed accept it. No is a complete sentence. He doesn't owe going to the funeral to anyone. Not to you and not your dad.", "\"My brother and father always had a rocky relationship but we\u2019re still a family and should be there for each other.\"\n\nThat first phrase is enough to go YTA on this one.

I don't know the particulars but will say it appears your brother harbors some serious resentments towards his/your father.  They may be justified, they may not.

Just because someone passes away doesn't magically change/mend the relationship that they had. Your brother's relationship with your father was clearly very different than the one that you and your sister had with him so this is his way of mourning your dad and you can't blame him for how he chooses to do so. Sure he might regret not going down the line but he also might not. I think that you need to respect his feelings and respect his boundaries.\n\nYTA for sure. Being family doesn't change the way that someone treats you and people need to realize being family doesn't obligate people to do anything for anyone before or after death.", "NAH.

You didn\u2019t go into detail about how your father treated his children and if you were all treated the same.  Even if you were all treated poorly by your father, you are still each allowed to process his death in your own way.  Saying something should be done just because you are all \u201cfamily\u201d  is unrealistic and usually only means everyone should go along because of how it would look to outsiders if one of you didn\u2019t show up at the funeral.\n\nGive your brother space and let him decide what is right for him.  If you genuinely want him there because you think it would be a comfort to you and not just for appearance sake, then think about how much comfort he would actually be to you if he is sitting next to you seething that he has to sit there and mourn someone he is very angry with.  Probably not much comfort.", "My condolences to your family.\n\nBut each of you have your own rlship with your father.

Don\u2019t resent him for that. Emotions are complicated, especially when someone dies that you are at odds with. So in this case you are very mildly YTA.\n\nAnyway, my condolences.", "YTA, for sure", "YTA there are 5 years between you and your brother.

And that is perfectly fine, but if he wants to distance himself from this then you should respect that.", "YTA Clearly you and your brother had a different type of relationship with your father.

His relationship with your father it seems was not the same as your relationship with him.  Even if they were similar, you each get to choose how you deal with that.  He's not comfortable attending.  He is not obligated to attend.", "YTA. Clearly your father didn't do his best since your brother hates him so much that he doesn't want to attend the funeral. You dismiss your brother's feelings because you think he doesn't have a right to them. You preach about family but clearly you don't care enough about your brother, who is family. You're just more concerned with how it'll look to everyone else when he's not there.", "YTA.  He doesn\u2019t want anything but his own possessions back from your dad\u2019s place.  The funeral is not a requirement.  Hell my sisters had a good relationship with our mom and they didn\u2019t attend her funeral.  Was I mad? Not at all.

You think dad did his best, then YOU can go to the funeral. Your brother doesn't think dad did his best. He's allowed to feel that way.

At least I think so. As you may know the distinction is rarely maintained in spoken or informal written English. And as I'm sure you probably know, whether to use \"I\" or \"me\" becomes clear when you use the long version: \"My sister went to the store and I went to the store,\" \"It was mostly my sister making the arrangements and me making the arrangements.\"\n\nAs for the situation, YTA. I agree with your boyfriend. Funerals are for the living, and it would cause your brother pain to attend.\n\nWith respect to your brother disrespecting the person who raised you, taken literally that is a spiritual or supernatural matter that is outside what can be decided here, except for this: your father's next of kin is your brother himself as the oldest child (it is apparent there is no surviving wife). So it is impossible for your brother to disrespect his father. The only people he is actually being disrespectful to are you and your sister as the younger next of kin.", "You have my condolences.

I find it suspicious the brother\u2019s only response was to immediately claim what he gets from a man openly couldn\u2019t stand.  He needs to walk the walk.\n\nEDITED TO ADD JUDGEMENT.", "Totally agreed. It would be one thing I'd OP asked for support for HERSELF. In that case, he might have been more inclined to help and be supportive. But op has to respect that he doesn't want to memorialize or pay respect to their Dad.", "What advantage? Looking at this I think brother wouldn't care if the father didn't get a burial and isn't going to attend therefore he's got nothing to do with that.", "Wait a second, she said he is active in flat cleaning and splitting. He just doesn't care about how the funeral is and that's fair enough.", "Selfish and twisted for not attending the funeral of someone that wasn't a good parent to him? You seem like the twisted one.", "I have lost both my parents and all my grandparents - not everyone helps.  That\u2019s just a fact of death. Brother had a different relationship with Dad. Everyone deals with it differently. \n\nAs far of the stuff is concerned, I\u2019m most countries he\u2019s entitled to a third by law as there is no will. Another fact of death.", "Considering he's the eldest and only male offspring we could say that if the sisters describe the relationship as rocky at best, he probably has valid reasons to not care of his old man died and gets buried.", "Aaaaaaaahhh\u2026.!!! Oh my bad! I misunderstood, I thought he did nothing\u2026\nOk thanks for clarifying! \ud83d\ude4f"]}
