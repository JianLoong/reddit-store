Maria attended public school until tenth grade when Esther enrolled her in a religious private school. Esther said that she had always wanted Maria to have a Christian education, but their previous circumstances hadn\u2019t allowed it. Because Esther\u2019s new husband is well-off and willing to help pay, my aunt enrolled Maria in the Christian school. Maria herself was very against it, as she liked her previous school and had good friends there, and she didn\u2019t want to go to a Christian school. Esther still enrolled Maria, saying the academics were better, Maria would come to like her new school, and Maria would become religious as well if she went to a school with religious peers.\n\nSome of the academics are objectively better than at Maria\u2019s previous school but all of Esther\u2019s other assumptions about the Christian school were wrong. Maria has become the \u201cclass clown\u201d at her school. She\u2019s disruptive to the point of regularly being removed from mass and lessons, which is a huge shift as Maria used to enjoy school and was well-liked by her previous teachers. I\u2019ve talked to Maria about it, and while she\u2019s never said it outright, Maria\u2019s statements very much indicate (to me at least) that she\u2019s trying to get kicked out of the Christian school on purpose so that she can go back to her old school. Maria has to attend summer school due to her grades and behavior during the school year and Esther claims they\u2019re in a fight every day over it.\n\nEsther is no longer allowing Maria to talk to her non-Christian friends from her previous school because she believes they are a bad influence, and that it will motivate Maria to socialize with her peers from the Christian school instead. They\u2019re fighting even more because of it, which Esther claims she didn\u2019t even know was possible. Esther came to me because she knows Maria looks up to me and said that, as a fellow Christian, I would be able to help \u201cguide her onto the right path\u201d by convincing Maria to begin doing what Esther wants.\n\nI instead explained to Esther that I also went to a Christian school, and by no means was it bad, but it\u2019s definitely not for everyone. Especially when Maria was happy and didn't want to leave her previous school. I also said that while I am Christian and will encourage a person once to give it a chance, I recognize that you can\u2019t force anyone to share your beliefs and if they don\u2019t want to, then you need to respect their wishes. I told Esther that if she won\u2019t accept that Maria will not be exactly the person Esther wants her to be, she may lose Maria forever.\n\nEsther was very upset and ended up telling family members, several of whom reached out to me. They said Esther is acting out of genuine fear for her only child because of what she believes happens to people who are not religious like her. So what I\u2019m telling Esther to do isn\u2019t as easy as I\u2019m making it out to be, and was \u201ccruel and insensitive\u201d to her beliefs.

To believe that if your children do not choose your belief system, they will burn in a terrible hell forever is awful. You are NTA. You aren't being cruel and insensitive to her beliefs. You aren't telling her her belief's are wrong, or that she needs to change them.  You are being honest. You are telling her that having a child does not guarantee a compliant mini-me that will follow in her footsteps. That we are all born with free will and the right to make choices ( that's in the bible too!) But you are correct in warning her that not considering her daughter's feelings could put a wedge in their relationship permanently and which school she goes to is a very silly hill to sacrifice a relationship on, especially because her daughter was doing well at the other school.", "> she asked me to help \u201cguide her daughter onto the right path?\u201d  \n\nThat's God's responsibility, not yours, not Esther's.  \n\nProv 16:9 A man's heart deviseth his way: but the LORD directeth his steps.  \n\nWhat happened to Jesus immediately after he was baptized?  \n\nMatt 4:1 Then was Jesus led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil.  \n\n\"They said Esther is acting out of genuine fear\"  \n\nDoes the Bible say anything about Mary trying to prevent Jesus from traveling out to the desert because the devil was out there waiting for him? OP already knows the answer is a resounding NO.  \n\nHeb 11:1 Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.  \n\nNTA", "NTA what esther is doing is cruel and insensitive, the only person she cares about is herself she's just disguising it like that to get away with it. She doesn't actually care about her daughter or her daughters feelings by pulling bs like this. If esther was a real christian she wouldn't be doing all of this to her daughter.", "NTA. Colleges look at grades, and Maria is tanking her grades because she has been pulled from the school she liked and the friends she had. She is ruining her daughter's life and future because of her irrational fear. She needs to be told how terrible her decision is.", "You need to tell Esther that she's being a Pharisee and refusing to associate with people that live in the real world. Jesus associated with nonbelievers and was hated by the religious elites of his time that wanted to be kept separate from the riff-raff of common society. Time to tell Christian mamma she's not being very Christlike.", "NTA. I'm religious now but when I was younger due to some circumstances of my childhood, I was completely against religion. My parents forced my to go to church and all of that from fear of me straying from the path and all that good stuff. It quite literally made me HATE religion even more. Thankfully I found it myself when I'm older but shoving your religion down someone's throat, makes them dislike it even more. You were completely right in what you said. Esther is making Maria absolutely miserable and she'll be lucky if Maria is ever open to religion again or if they ever have a good relationship after this. Not only this but Maria is ruining her future by trying to get kicked out of the school her mother forced her into. Not blaming maria, I would have done the same, this is on her mother. So yeah, you gave words of wisdom and if Esther doesn't like it, that's too bad because its true. The truth isn't always pretty.", "NTA. Aunt Esther needs a reality check! Trying to control Maria's friends won't solve anything; it'll only breed resentment.", "NTA- notice your relatives are pissed  because of your Aunt's feelings, not Maria's wellbeing...", "NTA, looks like trying to avoid something actually brought it about. Your aunt was trying to avoid your cousin doing what she viewed as degenerate behavior and now your cousin is definitely doing it. Well, you know what they say: make plans, God laughs.", "NTA \n\nThe harder a parent tries to force their religious views on a child, the harder the child will rebel later on in life. I was raised \"ideally\", in a Christian fundamentalist homeschool cult (not IBLP, but check out Shiny Happy People for the vibe). No friends who weren't also Christian homeschoolers. Earth is 6000 years old. Noah was real, everything is literal. The hypoliteralism ended up being the nail in the coffin.\n\nThe second I was able to read a real science book everything shattered for me and I lost every single ounce of faith I had. If one thing was false, couldn't everything else be false too? Deconstructing is a whole process. Some of us come out atheists, some agnostics, some with their faith intact but changed. \n\nAll this to say - the more it is pushed on her the more likely it is to backfire. I'd even give her that as a reason to stop pushing her into Christian-only friendships. Or don't. Same thing will happen. Lol", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
