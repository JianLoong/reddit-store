Maria attended public school until tenth grade when Esther enrolled her in a religious private school. Esther said that she had always wanted Maria to have a Christian education, but their previous circumstances hadn\u2019t allowed it. Because Esther\u2019s new husband is well-off and willing to help pay, my aunt enrolled Maria in the Christian school. Maria herself was very against it, as she liked her previous school and had good friends there, and she didn\u2019t want to go to a Christian school. Esther still enrolled Maria, saying the academics were better, Maria would come to like her new school, and Maria would become religious as well if she went to a school with religious peers.\n\nSome of the academics are objectively better than at Maria\u2019s previous school but all of Esther\u2019s other assumptions about the Christian school were wrong. Maria has become the \u201cclass clown\u201d at her school. She\u2019s disruptive to the point of regularly being removed from mass and lessons, which is a huge shift as Maria used to enjoy school and was well-liked by her previous teachers. I\u2019ve talked to Maria about it, and while she\u2019s never said it outright, Maria\u2019s statements very much indicate (to me at least) that she\u2019s trying to get kicked out of the Christian school on purpose so that she can go back to her old school. Maria has to attend summer school due to her grades and behavior during the school year and Esther claims they\u2019re in a fight every day over it.\n\nEsther is no longer allowing Maria to talk to her non-Christian friends from her previous school because she believes they are a bad influence, and that it will motivate Maria to socialize with her peers from the Christian school instead. They\u2019re fighting even more because of it, which Esther claims she didn\u2019t even know was possible. Esther came to me because she knows Maria looks up to me and said that, as a fellow Christian, I would be able to help \u201cguide her onto the right path\u201d by convincing Maria to begin doing what Esther wants.\n\nI instead explained to Esther that I also went to a Christian school, and by no means was it bad, but it\u2019s definitely not for everyone. Especially when Maria was happy and didn't want to leave her previous school. I also said that while I am Christian and will encourage a person once to give it a chance, I recognize that you can\u2019t force anyone to share your beliefs and if they don\u2019t want to, then you need to respect their wishes. I told Esther that if she won\u2019t accept that Maria will not be exactly the person Esther wants her to be, she may lose Maria forever.\n\nEsther was very upset and ended up telling family members, several of whom reached out to me. They said Esther is acting out of genuine fear for her only child because of what she believes happens to people who are not religious like her. So what I\u2019m telling Esther to do isn\u2019t as easy as I\u2019m making it out to be, and was \u201ccruel and insensitive\u201d to her beliefs.

Thankfully I found it myself when I'm older but shoving your religion down someone's throat, makes them dislike it even more. You were completely right in what you said. Esther is making Maria absolutely miserable and she'll be lucky if Maria is ever open to religion again or if they ever have a good relationship after this. Not only this but Maria is ruining her future by trying to get kicked out of the school her mother forced her into. Not blaming maria, I would have done the same, this is on her mother.

While I will not disagree with the slightly higher educational value, there are many other shortcomings. \n\nPrivate school is already a small bubble (idk which school you're referring to, but I'm assuming that it is small compared to nearby public schools), and she's already made friends from public school, so cutting her off isn't going to help. There's also this assumption that private school is safe for kids and they won't be exposed to \"bad influences\" (i.e. drugs, alcohol, \"alternative lifestyles\" not agreeing, just sharing my experience), and that's not always true or good. For example, my school was not big into drugs and alcohol, but I know a few Christian schools that were. And when we graduated, myself and others pretty much went wild in college (drank freshmen year and tried drugs in sophomore year). Most also teach creationism, which caused me to struggle with some of my college classes. There's no sex ed, and if it came out that you had sex, then you were expelled (happened to two of my classmates in 8th grade). \n\nMy mom is similar to your aunt in that she thinks its better than public school, my sister and I both have various degrees and my mom insists it's because of private school. However my sister and I agree that it was because of our own hard work and drive. Given a choice, we would have preferred public school. \n\nYour aunt has a mold that she wants her daughter to fit, but she's a teenager and will be leaving for college soon. I would make your family understand that if they continue to force her, then they may drive her away from their lives for possibly forever. \n\nOh and fun fact, more than half of the alum who graduated the school are no longer religious.
