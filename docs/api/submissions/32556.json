We have been together for 9 months. She has met my parents via zoom, but this is the first time they\u2019ll be seeing each other in real life, and this is the very first time I\u2019ll be introducing her to my siblings. \n\nSo, there is a family friend (F30), let\u2019s call her Susy. Susy\u2019s mom was best friends with my mom since before any of us were born. Growing up  Susy was close with all my siblings and I. We are mostly just facebook friends now, but  she still is BFF with my younger sister (F29) and she is still close to my parents.  \n\nSusy and her mom  started celebrating Christmas with my family  after her dad passed away in 2005. Her  mom passed away during the pandemic, so Susy is the only one that joins us during the holidays now. \n\nSo, to the situation. A couple of nights ago  I was showing my GF pictures of last year's Christmas dinner and  she  asked who Susy was since she couldn\u2019t possibly be one of my siblings, we look nothing alike, we are different races too. I said she was a family\u2019s  friend. She asked if Susy was dating one of my brothers, I said no, she is just a family friend. She said it was odd that just a family friend joined us for Christmas Dinner and asked if by any chance she was my ex-GF. I said no, she is just a family friend. And then I proceeded to explain to her that Susy joins us every year for the reasons stated above in this post. \n\nShe asked me if Susy will be joining us this year too, and I said yes, and she said I never mentioned this. I said I didn\u2019t think it was important. She is upset by this, and said she is crossing the countries to meet my parents and siblings and I never mentioned a random woman will be joining us too.  I didn\u2019t think it was worth mentioning at all. She has been cold to me since that night and is second guessing joining the christmas dinner. \n\nMy GF is not the type to be insecure, and she has no reason to be since in the whole interaction I don\u2019t remember making any comments that could cause a misunderstanding making her believe that I\u2019m attracted o Susy or something. Which I\u2019m not. At this point she feels like that cousin that you only see during the holidays and get along well with, but I don\u2019t remember she exists  the rest of the year, as I mentioned she is mostly close to my parents and sister. \n\nShe is also not the type to act like this just because I forgot to mention something unimportant.

We have been together for 9 months. She has met my parents via zoom, but this is the first time they\u2019ll be seeing each other in real life, and this is the very first time I\u2019ll be introducing her to my siblings. \n\nSo, there is a family friend (F30), let\u2019s call her Susy. Susy\u2019s mom was best friends with my mom since before any of us were born. Growing up  Susy was close with all my siblings and I. We are mostly just facebook friends now, but  she still is BFF with my younger sister (F29) and she is still close to my parents.  \n\nSusy and her mom  started celebrating Christmas with my family  after her dad passed away in 2005. Her  mom passed away during the pandemic, so Susy is the only one that joins us during the holidays now. \n\nSo, to the situation. A couple of nights ago  I was showing my GF pictures of last year's Christmas dinner and  she  asked who Susy was since she couldn\u2019t possibly be one of my siblings, we look nothing alike, we are different races too. I said she was a family\u2019s  friend. She asked if Susy was dating one of my brothers, I said no, she is just a family friend.

I didn\u2019t think it was worth mentioning at all. She has been cold to me since that night and is second guessing joining the christmas dinner. \n\nMy GF is not the type to be insecure, and she has no reason to be since in the whole interaction I don\u2019t remember making any comments that could cause a misunderstanding making her believe that I\u2019m attracted o Susy or something. Which I\u2019m not.

Innocent on OP\u2019s part it seems, but it\u2019s kind of understandable from his girlfriend\u2019s perspective that he never mentioned her, and she only found out bc she saw a picture and asked repeatedly for clarification on who the person is bc he wasn\u2019t offering the information until her third asking. \n\nOP is just a bad communicator like most guys, and his girlfriend is in her feels about it for now and hopefully one of them will snap out of to start a proper discussion and get the mess behind them.", "Where does it say she wants to control who is there?\nShe just wants to know in advance how many people she is going to meet and be judged by. Before you jump on the word 'judged', remember when OP and his GF leave, the parents and friend WILL be discussing her, saying what they thought of her. It's human nature. Even if they think she is wonderful, it's still judging.\n\nWhen my ex took me to meet his parents for the first time - dinner at his parents house - he didn't tell me that his mother's crazy sister, his brother and his sister-in-law would also be there. A heads up would have been kind.", "No I would be weirded out only at the fact I hadn\u2019t heard about this person and you\u2019re saying she\u2019s unimportant but clearly she\u2019s very close to the family and that\u2019s a person that is important? I would have this reaction no matter gender or age like it\u2019s odd you just forgot about mentioning this person then call them unimportant when it sounds like they are basically a part of immediate family!", "That part.", "I agree. My holidays are very much like Suzy's holidays. I don't have any family so some dear friends of my mother's who have known me since I was little, kind of took me in as part of theirs after the last of my family passed. I'm invited to every holiday and even birthday dinners. So much so that I've become family. I'm just thankful that of their children, none of them would date someone who' d be opposed to allowing their parents to invite whoever the heck they wanted to Holiday dinners. One of the kids has actually brought three different partners over the years.  none of them were told upfront that I was going to be there or that cousins were going to be there or other family friends or distant relatives might be there. And not one of them ever had a problem with it because ideally it's none of their business.", "Oh that's a good one", "In  Li was there is a comment about her skin colour from OP, this seems like a stretch. More like she\u2019s very attractive and that has made gf insecure", "Nah, because she immediately asked if he or his brother dated Susy.  I think Susy is probably really pretty and his gf is intimidated by her.", "Is \u201crandom\u201d a protected cohort?", "GF needs to be more concerned about making a good impression because having beef with a family friend you've never met before is NOT the way to start.", "Exactly. Some of my closest family members aren\u2019t technically related to me.", "Like, tell me Cousin Itt is genetically related to the Addamses.", "People are overlooking everything about this and just saying,\u201d she\u2019s crazy and controlling!\u201d \n\nShe\u2019s not controlling anything. I once tagged a long with a friend to his family\u2019s Christmas dinner, he said it\u2019s just his family. It was the extended family as well, and partners of people and other friends. I expected about a 6 people. There was 20+. \n\nBeing mentally prepared for everyone you will meet is a common habit of people. I also just don\u2019t like feeling as if anyone is left out of something even if people are new to me. I will make and bring things for people. I often make extra by a few bc you never know, but even then I like knowing how many I definitely need to bring.", "Where do you all keep getting this idea that his girlfriend is trying to get Susy uninvited? He didn\u2019t say that at all. You all have a completely different story going on in your head.", "Probably didn't mention Suzy because OP doesn't really care if Suzy and GF get along... OP calls her a \"family friend\" and doesn't have a relationship with her. His sister does...\n\nHe mentioned the people that he's hoping will like his GF... the ones that he's excited about her meeting.", "My first thought: this gf is a racist.  She was fine until she saw the photo and realized who she would be eating and socializing with, someone she looks down upon.", "Possibly", "It was definitely an Olympic leap. Probably worth a gold medal", "\u201cMy sister\u2019s best friend.\u201d \u201cOur neighbor who practically lived at our house as a kid.\u201d\n\nBIG leap to get to \u201coh yeah I\u2019m still so close with this ex I never mentioned that she still comes around for holidays.\u201d", "Or she's racist and jealous.", "Why not both?", "Maybe she's hot on top of it as others have pointed out.", "She didn\u2019t know Susy existed or would be there until she saw the photo.", "yeah, i couldn\u2019t be with somebody who presumed things of me in that way. that\u2019s a severe lack of trust and it would tell me that my partner doubted my character. it would hurt me, really.", "rendering your entire comment inert, thank you", "I didn\u2019t get the impression that OP provided a clear list of who would be attending. When his gf saw the picture, she realized Susy wasn\u2019t one of his siblings because of her different appearance, not because she wasn\u2019t on a list.", "You seem sweet. Let's be friends"]}
