She didn't even have to come out, as she has been talking about her girl crushes since middle school.\n\nShe has a really close best friend, Ben, who was always allowed to come over and even sleep at our house, because our parents viewed him as just a friend. Meanwhile I was never allowed to have boys over. Their relationship was always a bit suspicious to me, because they were always very close physically, play wrestling with each other and such.\n\nShe is 19 now, attending the same college as Ben and they even live together as \"roommates\". She came home last weekend and announced that Ben and her are dating now. Our parents were really surprised, but they didn't say anything.\n\nI pulled her aside to ask what's up. I see two options: 1) She is not into Ben, but suddenly decided to use him as a beard and go back to the closet for some mysterious reason. 2) She was always into him and they had been secretly dating all this time, and she purposefully lied to our parents to be able to spend more time with Ben.\n\nShe said that she didn't lie, she needed time to figure out her sexuality and coming to terms with her bisexuality when everyone treated her like a lesbian since she was 8 didn't make it easy for her. She also said that if I have a problem with our parents not letting me have boys over, I need to take it up with them, not her.\n\nThen she treated me like shit the whole rest of the weekend. I think asking her what's going on was an absolutely fair question and her reaction is over the board. But on the other hand, I'm straight and I have no clue how it is to grow up openly lesbian/closetedly bi.

Sexuality cam be complex, and not everyone knows exactly how they identify early on (in fact, many people do not). Accusing your sister of \"lying\" about her orientation is hostile, rude and just weird.

You don't get to define your sister's sexuality and decide that she's not bisexual just because you jumped to conclusions earlier in life.

I didn't even have the language to figure myself out till I was in my 40s. You want a reason to be pissed at her and magically found one.", "YTA. I think you know it. Because there's a third option and it's that she never lied to anyone and was coming to terms with the fact that she'd been attracted to a guy for awhile. No one lies about being a lesbian from the age of 8 just to have boys sleep over. SMH.\n\nI think your main issue is she got to have a guy sleep over and you didn't.

She was a young girl trying to figure out who she was. Like most young kids they don\u2019t know what they don\u2019t know and things change. I mean for crying out loud there are plenty of people who have male/female relationships and end up getting married and then things change where one of them will come out and truly express their sexuality.

You should be happy for her and Ben and not accusing her of secretly having a relationship with him.", "YTA, and you sound a bit unhinged.", "YTA. You don't really get to decide what is going on for your sister sexually and there are more options than the two you've decided MUST be it, including option 3) that she was and is bisexual. It seems like you secretly or not-so-secretly have feelings of jealousy and distrust for your sister, and are suspicious that from a young age she connived to be allowed to have a male sleepover for salacious purposes. Obviously it would have been nice if she hadn't gotten angry at your line of questioning, but it seems like YOU are the one who made a big deal out of this revelation and questioned the validity of either her feelings, her past sexual expressions, or their relationship, which was out of line.", "YTA \n\nI really don\u2019t need to explain it more than that.

There are also people who are attracted to transgender and people who are attracted to objects. It's shocking for you I guess, but this is the truth.

You have masculine gay men and feminine gay men. There is no box for people to be placed in. \n\nYou're issue is the fact, your parents assumed she was a lesbian and allowed a boy over.

I identified as gold star lesbian for a good part of my teen years, and had a 'Ben' friend too.

Even if she was always bi and knew it or if she and Ben were always involved and were in fact messing around while he stayed over, *that is none of your business*.

She didn't even have to come out, as she has been talking about her girl crushes since middle school.\n\nShe has a really close best friend, Ben, who was always allowed to come over and even sleep at our house, because our parents viewed him as just a friend. Meanwhile I was never allowed to have boys over. Their relationship was always a bit suspicious to me, because they were always very close physically, play wrestling with each other and such.\n\nShe is 19 now, attending the same college as Ben and they even live together as \"roommates\". She came home last weekend and announced that Ben and her are dating now. Our parents were really surprised, but they didn't say anything.\n\nI pulled her aside to ask what's up. I see two options: 1) She is not into Ben, but suddenly decided to use him as a beard and go back to the closet for some mysterious reason. 2) She was always into him and they had been secretly dating all this time, and she purposefully lied to our parents to be able to spend more time with Ben.\n\nShe said that she didn't lie, she needed time to figure out her sexuality and coming to terms with her bisexuality when everyone treated her like a lesbian since she was 8 didn't make it easy for her. She also said that if I have a problem with our parents not letting me have boys over, I need to take it up with them, not her.\n\nThen she treated me like shit the whole rest of the weekend. I think asking her what's going on was an absolutely fair question and her reaction is over the board. But on the other hand, I'm straight and I have no clue how it is to grow up openly lesbian/closetedly bi. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It\u2019s not easy for everyone to figure out their sexuality. I\u2019ve know many people who use different labels for themselves than they did as teens.

I\u2019ve know people who identified as bi or pan and later discovered they were actually gay/lesbian.

There\u2019s nothing wrong with that, no matter what you or others might think.

This story makes me think of a friend of mine from college who really struggled coming to terms with being bi... because he'd been brave enough to be a proudly out gay kid in the deep south in the early '00s.

AND TELL HER THAT IF YOU DO THAT! You can save so much of your relationship with just one sentence, \"I do not, at **this** time, understand how your sexuality could have changed, but I am taking steps **to learn** how that process works, so I can better understand **your journey** though this change.\"", "You can be in a long term relationship with one person and be bi at the same time. You can be single your entire life and be bi. Your relationship status is only one piece of your sexuality.\n\nWould you expect a straight man to no longer find other women attractive just because he has a girlfriend? It\u2019s pretty generally accepted that straight men can feel attraction to women they aren\u2019t partnered with.
