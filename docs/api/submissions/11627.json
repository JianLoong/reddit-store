She didn't even have to come out, as she has been talking about her girl crushes since middle school.\n\nShe has a really close best friend, Ben, who was always allowed to come over and even sleep at our house, because our parents viewed him as just a friend. Meanwhile I was never allowed to have boys over. Their relationship was always a bit suspicious to me, because they were always very close physically, play wrestling with each other and such.\n\nShe is 19 now, attending the same college as Ben and they even live together as \"roommates\". She came home last weekend and announced that Ben and her are dating now. Our parents were really surprised, but they didn't say anything.\n\nI pulled her aside to ask what's up. I see two options: 1) She is not into Ben, but suddenly decided to use him as a beard and go back to the closet for some mysterious reason. 2) She was always into him and they had been secretly dating all this time, and she purposefully lied to our parents to be able to spend more time with Ben.\n\nShe said that she didn't lie, she needed time to figure out her sexuality and coming to terms with her bisexuality when everyone treated her like a lesbian since she was 8 didn't make it easy for her. She also said that if I have a problem with our parents not letting me have boys over, I need to take it up with them, not her.\n\nThen she treated me like shit the whole rest of the weekend. I think asking her what's going on was an absolutely fair question and her reaction is over the board. But on the other hand, I'm straight and I have no clue how it is to grow up openly lesbian/closetedly bi.

If everyone had assumed she was straight from a young age and then she suddenly said she was dating her best friend that was a girl, you wouldn't have accused her of lying that she was straight.

Sexuality cam be complex, and not everyone knows exactly how they identify early on (in fact, many people do not). Accusing your sister of \"lying\" about her orientation is hostile, rude and just weird.

You don't get to define your sister's sexuality and decide that she's not bisexual just because you jumped to conclusions earlier in life.

I didn't even have the language to figure myself out till I was in my 40s. You want a reason to be pissed at her and magically found one.", "YTA. I think you know it. Because there's a third option and it's that she never lied to anyone and was coming to terms with the fact that she'd been attracted to a guy for awhile. No one lies about being a lesbian from the age of 8 just to have boys sleep over. SMH.\n\nI think your main issue is she got to have a guy sleep over and you didn't.

She was a young girl trying to figure out who she was. Like most young kids they don\u2019t know what they don\u2019t know and things change. I mean for crying out loud there are plenty of people who have male/female relationships and end up getting married and then things change where one of them will come out and truly express their sexuality.

You don't really get to decide what is going on for your sister sexually and there are more options than the two you've decided MUST be it, including option 3) that she was and is bisexual. It seems like you secretly or not-so-secretly have feelings of jealousy and distrust for your sister, and are suspicious that from a young age she connived to be allowed to have a male sleepover for salacious purposes. Obviously it would have been nice if she hadn't gotten angry at your line of questioning, but it seems like YOU are the one who made a big deal out of this revelation and questioned the validity of either her feelings, her past sexual expressions, or their relationship, which was out of line.", "YTA \n\nI really don\u2019t need to explain it more than that.

She didn't even have to come out, as she has been talking about her girl crushes since middle school.\n\nShe has a really close best friend, Ben, who was always allowed to come over and even sleep at our house, because our parents viewed him as just a friend. Meanwhile I was never allowed to have boys over. Their relationship was always a bit suspicious to me, because they were always very close physically, play wrestling with each other and such.\n\nShe is 19 now, attending the same college as Ben and they even live together as \"roommates\". She came home last weekend and announced that Ben and her are dating now. Our parents were really surprised, but they didn't say anything.\n\nI pulled her aside to ask what's up. I see two options: 1) She is not into Ben, but suddenly decided to use him as a beard and go back to the closet for some mysterious reason. 2) She was always into him and they had been secretly dating all this time, and she purposefully lied to our parents to be able to spend more time with Ben.\n\nShe said that she didn't lie, she needed time to figure out her sexuality and coming to terms with her bisexuality when everyone treated her like a lesbian since she was 8 didn't make it easy for her. She also said that if I have a problem with our parents not letting me have boys over, I need to take it up with them, not her.\n\nThen she treated me like shit the whole rest of the weekend.

Look at it this way: She's mistaken for lesbian her whole life. Now that she's finally out as bi, her own sister decides that means she's either engaged in ongoing deceit or was as a kid. What a gut punch! And keep in mind thati people being told they're not really their orientation or are liars is one of the most common forms of biphobia", "You don't believe that your sister is Bi? Why not just accept her if she is happy with Ben?", "I would call you an asshole, but I have a feeling you're like, 14. So I'll refrain.", "YTA. Sexuality is not straightforward. Sometimes it takes a long time to figure out who you are and what you like. For some people that means changing how they identify as they get older. You calling her a liar is not appropriate.", "YTA, it\u2019s none of your business who she dates and opinion 3. She\u2019s bi and she figured things out. She didn\u2019t lie.", "YTA, this is very similar to how a lot of \"formerly straight\" lesbians feel about their sexuality growing up. They're constantly told they're one thing and as they grow up they realize they're something else. It's entirely possible she never felt any attraction to any other men, and as time went on she started feeling it for Ben. That's fine, and it doesn't make her a liar", "YTA. You immediately jumped to the conclusion that your sister was toxic, couldn't think of a reason why she would Ike a boy other than her being toxic. Your sister is trying to figure out her sexuality and is working through being bi. She does not need you to attack her. At 19, I had no idea what my sexuality was. You need to apologize asap to your sister.", "YTA for assuming she must have been lying one way or the other.\n\nHave you never heard of childhood friends only dating later in life? It's not that unusual. And that's without the whole mess of trying to figure out your sexuality. \n\nYou could have gently asked for more information about her relationship with Ben or what she currently identifies as without accusing her of lying (and by making it clear she didn't have to answer any questions).", "YTA YTA YTA\n\nIt is INCREDIBLY hard to grow up as a bi girl/lesbian, and your sister has been bearing that weight fearlessly from what i can infer from your post. she\u2019s finally figured out who she is after years of judgement (no doubt made worse by you) and instead of being thrilled to hear of her freedom, you give her shit for it.\n\nshe hasn\u2019t lied about anything, you just assumed. give her a break. again, YTA.\n\nedit: grammar", "YTA. This is exactly why us bisexuals have trouble being honest and open about our sexuality. We're told we have to choose one or the other in order to \"fit in\" with the straights or the gays. And if we choose, the other group claims we must have never actually been straight or gay or we were making it up for attention.", "YTA.\n\nToo many people, but especially too many young people, think that sexuality is a concrete thing that, once you know it, is always unchanging.  This isn't true, and it just hurts everyone when someone insists on acting as if it's true -- including people who ARE LGBTQ+.\n\nYour sister is completely correct that everyone (trying to be helpful!) treating her as \"a lesbian\" from age 8 onwards was actually NOT helping her, and cause her trouble in evaluating her ongoing understanding of herself.  \n\nSexuality remains a highly social construct.  All of the various terms for it are just labels that are meant to help people convey what they're feeling and who they are.  Those labels should never hold someone back, and that's the problem that too few queer people realize until they've gone through some really difficult times.\n\nWhen I say that sexuality is a social construct, I mean it in the way that society puts expectations on sexuality, how it is expressed, and most importantly in the demands made on people to adhere to certain labels or behaviors in order to be seen as \"valid\".  This is most obvious in how long heterosexuality was considered the only option, and compulsory.  Sure, it's a good thing that many people are much more open to other sexualities now.  The problem is that society has built up expectations around those as well.\n\nYou're demonstrating this very clearly in this post.  In an ideal world, you and your parents should have known that your sister might turn out to be bisexual or pansexual, especially as her body matured.  That's the kindest way to handle anyone who is exploring their sexuality -- put no expectations on what they are, or where they will end up.  It doesn't help anyone to look at a child and say, \"oh, she's a lesbian!  great, let's support her!\", if that means that she is now allowed to be a lesbian \\*but never anything else\\*.\n\nYour sister is really no different from anyone who grew up thinking they were straight, only to figure out in their late teens or 20s that they thought they were straight because they are surrounded by social expectations telling them that they SHOULD be straight.  You would not -- I HOPE -- say that a kid who grew up thinking they were straight, but who came out as bi or gay at age 19, had \"just been lying\" this whole time.  Right?  RIGHT?  \n\nThis is absolutely no different. You're trying to hold your sister to an identity that was \\*placed on her\\* when she was very young.  That doesn't work for anyone.\n\nShifting identities within the queer community comes with its own set of problems.  There is a long, long history of bisexuals being treated as \"not belonging\" in queer communities, while they certainly do not \"belong\" to the hetero community either.  There's also a long history of people just not believing bisexuals who say that they are, but instead their being subjected to pressure to conform to the label that seems to suit who they are dating (or marrying) at that moment. Too many people even within the queer community think that bisexuals are \"people who claimed they were gay but who are betraying the queer community\", and that is a profoundly fucked up thing to do to people within your own community.  With society becoming more accepting of gay people, LGBTQ+ people of all kinds feel social pressure to be \"representative\" of their label, which keeps them from continuing to grow in their understanding of who they are.\n\nTo put it more shortly: figuring out your sexuality can be a long process of trying out various things, because NOBODY gets to grow up in an environment in which there are not pressures acting on them in various ways.  That can be the the pressure to be hetero, or the pressure to be \"the ideal gay person\".  (It can also be the pressure to have sex, or to want a romantic relationship, since those are also things that everything surrounding us in society tells us we \\*have to\\* want in order to be fulfilled.)\n\nYou and your family are not necessarily at fault for not knowing the ideal way to be supportive of your sister as she was growing up.  You aren't even necessarily an asshole for having this ignorant reaction (\"I see only two options\" - well, there's your first mistake!).  \n\nWhat truly will show how much of an asshole you are is whether you can learn more about this, learn where you went wrong, and apologize to your sister.   Not just for calling her a liar now, but also for unconsciously boxing her into an identity that was still a work in progress.\n\nIf you actually want to be a good ally, you have to realize that there are a lot of things for you to learn about what it means to be LGBTQ+.   So swallow your pride, and admit you were wrong, and that you needed to learn more to understand what's going on.\n\n(I do also want to say that it sounds like you're young.  You say you're straight.  And that's fine!  But don't let that inhibit you, if you ever do start to question later whether you might be bi, or gay, or anything.  That is, your claiming of the straight label now is fine, but don't feel like having done so means you can never change it later, just because you've declared it now.  Heck, you might hit a point in the future where you wonder if you might be bi, you do some introspection, maybe go on a same-sex date, and then realize... no, you aren't, you really are straight.  That's fine too!  The most important thing is that the label you choose works for you.  If it no longer works for you, discard it.  Or, come back to it with a better understanding that it \\*is\\* what works for you.  And if it keeps working for you for your entire life, that's great!  But that's not how life goes for everyone, so you have to give others grace to change and try out different things on their own journeys.)", "YTA-why is this your business?

There's gender identity, which is which gender(s) you identify as, and then there's orientation, which is which people you're attracted to and the degree to which you're attracted or not attracted. \n\nSome examples of gender identity: \n\n- transgender: identifying as a different gender than the one you were assigned at birth based on your genitalia. Notable abbreviations for talking about being transgender are AFAB (assigned female at birth), AMAB (assigned male at birth), MtF (male-to-female, a.k.a. a trans woman), FtM (female-to-male, a.k.a. a trans man)\n- nonbinary: not identifying as part of the man/woman gender binary. This could mean identifying as something between the two, or something entirely different.\n- genderfluid: gender identity is different at different times\n- intersex: a physical state of having \"ambiguous\" genitalia which was once treated as a medical condition that needed \"correction\" (and unfortunately still is by many people) but now is seeing a big push to be accepted as its own gender identity\n\nThere's some overlap in these labels because of their different meanings. Someone who is nonbinary might consider themselves transgender because they feel that their gender identity doesn't match with their genitalia/physical sex characteristics, for example. \n\nSome examples of orientation:\n\n- Asexual: \"ace\" for short, doesn't feel sexual attraction. Note that ace folks can still participate in and enjoy sex and sex-related activities; they just don't feel sexual *attraction* in the same way. For example, I have one ace friend who's into BDSM and another who writes smut.\n- Aromantic: \"aro\" for short, doesn't feel romantic attraction (note: you can be asexual but not aromantic, or aromantic but not asexual, or you can be both)\n- Allosexual/alloromantic: feels sexual/romantic attraction\n- Gay/homosexual: Attracted to the \"same\" gender as yours, whatever that entails in practice (given all the different kinds of gender that exist, \"gay\" can actually cover a lot more than you'd expect)\n- Lesbian: specifically for women attracted to women. There is actually a lot of *discourse* about what qualifies as \"lesbian\" in some circles but that is really not an issue that you're likely to encounter while you're still just learning-- just keep in mind that it is somewhat fraught and avoid the phrase \"bi/pan lesbian\" unless you are ready for a lot of words to happen lol\n- Bisexual: attracted to two genders, or sometimes used to refer to attraction to more than two genders because the definition has expanded for some. Stereotypes include making lemon bars, wearing jeans with cuffs, and being very bad at sitting in chairs (look up \"bisexual sitting\" for some amusing memes)\n- Pansexual: attracted to many genders/every gender\n- Demisexual: feels sexual attraction only to people they know well, doesn't feel \"spontaneous\" sexual attraction\n- When talking about romantic attraction rather than sexual attraction, you can use the above prefixes with the word \"romantic\" instead of \"sexual,\" e.g. homoromantic, biromantic\n\nThere's also a lot of overlap in these labels because they can refer to different things-- so someone can be biromantic and asexual, or pansexual and aromantic, and some terms (like pansexual and bisexual) have overlap for historical reasons or because meanings have shifted", "This is so wholesome and sweet.
