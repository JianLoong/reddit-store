She didn't even have to come out, as she has been talking about her girl crushes since middle school.\n\nShe has a really close best friend, Ben, who was always allowed to come over and even sleep at our house, because our parents viewed him as just a friend. Meanwhile I was never allowed to have boys over. Their relationship was always a bit suspicious to me, because they were always very close physically, play wrestling with each other and such.\n\nShe is 19 now, attending the same college as Ben and they even live together as \"roommates\". She came home last weekend and announced that Ben and her are dating now. Our parents were really surprised, but they didn't say anything.\n\nI pulled her aside to ask what's up. I see two options: 1) She is not into Ben, but suddenly decided to use him as a beard and go back to the closet for some mysterious reason. 2) She was always into him and they had been secretly dating all this time, and she purposefully lied to our parents to be able to spend more time with Ben.\n\nShe said that she didn't lie, she needed time to figure out her sexuality and coming to terms with her bisexuality when everyone treated her like a lesbian since she was 8 didn't make it easy for her. She also said that if I have a problem with our parents not letting me have boys over, I need to take it up with them, not her.\n\nThen she treated me like shit the whole rest of the weekend. I think asking her what's going on was an absolutely fair question and her reaction is over the board. But on the other hand, I'm straight and I have no clue how it is to grow up openly lesbian/closetedly bi.

Sexuality cam be complex, and not everyone knows exactly how they identify early on (in fact, many people do not). Accusing your sister of \"lying\" about her orientation is hostile, rude and just weird.

You don't get to define your sister's sexuality and decide that she's not bisexual just because you jumped to conclusions earlier in life.

I didn't even have the language to figure myself out till I was in my 40s. You want a reason to be pissed at her and magically found one.", "YTA. I think you know it. Because there's a third option and it's that she never lied to anyone and was coming to terms with the fact that she'd been attracted to a guy for awhile. No one lies about being a lesbian from the age of 8 just to have boys sleep over. SMH.\n\nI think your main issue is she got to have a guy sleep over and you didn't.

She was a young girl trying to figure out who she was. Like most young kids they don\u2019t know what they don\u2019t know and things change. I mean for crying out loud there are plenty of people who have male/female relationships and end up getting married and then things change where one of them will come out and truly express their sexuality.

You should be happy for her and Ben and not accusing her of secretly having a relationship with him.", "YTA, and you sound a bit unhinged.", "YTA. You don't really get to decide what is going on for your sister sexually and there are more options than the two you've decided MUST be it, including option 3) that she was and is bisexual. It seems like you secretly or not-so-secretly have feelings of jealousy and distrust for your sister, and are suspicious that from a young age she connived to be allowed to have a male sleepover for salacious purposes. Obviously it would have been nice if she hadn't gotten angry at your line of questioning, but it seems like YOU are the one who made a big deal out of this revelation and questioned the validity of either her feelings, her past sexual expressions, or their relationship, which was out of line.", "YTA \n\nI really don\u2019t need to explain it more than that.

She didn't even have to come out, as she has been talking about her girl crushes since middle school.\n\nShe has a really close best friend, Ben, who was always allowed to come over and even sleep at our house, because our parents viewed him as just a friend. Meanwhile I was never allowed to have boys over. Their relationship was always a bit suspicious to me, because they were always very close physically, play wrestling with each other and such.\n\nShe is 19 now, attending the same college as Ben and they even live together as \"roommates\". She came home last weekend and announced that Ben and her are dating now. Our parents were really surprised, but they didn't say anything.\n\nI pulled her aside to ask what's up. I see two options: 1) She is not into Ben, but suddenly decided to use him as a beard and go back to the closet for some mysterious reason. 2) She was always into him and they had been secretly dating all this time, and she purposefully lied to our parents to be able to spend more time with Ben.\n\nShe said that she didn't lie, she needed time to figure out her sexuality and coming to terms with her bisexuality when everyone treated her like a lesbian since she was 8 didn't make it easy for her. She also said that if I have a problem with our parents not letting me have boys over, I need to take it up with them, not her.\n\nThen she treated me like shit the whole rest of the weekend.

It would not be unusual for me to hook up with 2+ people (both guys and gals) in a day.  I'm not proud of this behavior. \n\nI've been in a relationship with a man who's much older than me for seven years.  It's the happiest and most at peace I've ever been.  Still, folks often hint that they believe he's a \"cover,\" especially with the age difference, despite this being my longest, healthiest relationship.", "I didn't come out for a long time because I felt like I was proving people right. I've been dealing with lesbian joke since I was under 10. It stops people being able to accept things too. She's been pigeonholed from so young and now she's realised she's bi. Good for her.", "It is assuming - talking about crushes on girls isn\u2019t exclusive to lesbians. OP acted an ass because they made the wrong assumption but should accept that their sister is bi, apologize for the accusations, and move on.", "I mean if she was only discussing female crushes, it could be implied that she was only into women. But it's still an assumption if she never outright declared she wasn't into men.", "Then that\u2019s still assuming, isn\u2019t it?", "What 19 year old doesn\u2019t live with at least 1 roommate? You tend to live with close friends if that\u2019s an option. There\u2019s nothing at all suspicious about their living situation.", "Right? YTA, OP. Try to be a better person.\n\nOption 3 the most likely option: her sexuality and her understanding of it evolved.", "Yes, thank you! This is a perfect example of bi erasure.", "But but but its not faaaaair \u2026Ugh. OP has serious main character syndrome.", "Partial comment stolen from u/GobiasACupOfCoffee\n\nu/strengthacceptab is a bot", "My mom thought I was a butch lesbian because I was a tomboy growing up who never talked about crushes on boys (or girls, but that got overlooked.)\n\nI am an aro bi trans man.\n\nPeople should stop labelling litteral kids over stereotypes.", "I'm straight, however I am always looking to learn. So if you don't mind me asking, what is ace?\n\nMy 12 year old niece had just told me last week she is non-binary. I'm learning as much as I can. She hasn't told her mom.\n\nWe grew up very conservative. I have an open mind. My sister does not. So I want to understand as much as I can because when I was growing up. You were either straight, gay, or bi. Obviously, there is so much more to it than just those boxes! \n\nI love her and support her 100%! So it's important for me to understand for her and for everyone out there! \u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f\n\nI hope this didn't come across as offensive at all. Definitely not my intention.", "It can be fluid and confusing for a lot of queer teenagers.\n\nMy daughter came out as bi when she was 11, then decided she was gay, switched back briefly to bi, and is now very much a lesbian at 19.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t mean she wasn\u2019t gay from the start. It means she wasn\u2019t sure what her feelings were, because teenager, and it took her a while to sort things out. And there\u2019s nothing wrong with that.", "Well, of course it's not a decision. I, personally, was only attracted to men from puberty. Solid five years of exclusive interest in boys. I thought about my sexuality, thank you very much, both on account of being extremely horny and on account of being distraught. I tried all the tricks to get myself to like girls, then I accepted that it just isn't the way I swing. There was no way I could decide myself into bisexuality or heterosexuality.\n\nThen as a young adult I started watching certain videos and slowly but surely I got a liking for women. That change in desires was not a decision either. \n\nI told some people that before. Some said that because I felt attraction to women at 17 I retroactively must have been attracted to them all along. I experienced no attraction to women but I was attracted to women ontologically or whatever. By that logic everyone is bisexual, because who knows what future!you will find sexy?\n\nSome said I'm gay and I need to stop consuming porn to regain my \"true\" sexuality. I don't feel like it.  \n\nYou've always been bi and that's neat. I can't say that honestly and that's neat too. No one chooses their desires anyway.", "*wear makeup exactly once a year for the Super Bowl.*\n\nHad to upvote this lol", "Yeah it is lol", "People should stop labeling.", "People should stop labeling.", "Let me start off by saying you sound like one of the most awesome people ever! Supportive family is amazing and your niece will definitely appreciate it.\n\nAce is short for asexual, which means I simply don't feel attracted to people at all. Some aces don't necessarily mind having sex but most don't bother with it. Experiences vary a lot. Sadly it means a lot of aces struggle to fit in or find relationships since pretty much everyone else values sex a lot. You'll find most asexuals joking they'd much rather have cake than sex etc\nVery brief explanation, I hope it's somewhat understandable :)", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 12: [This Is Not A Debate Sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/). \r\n\r\n>No starting off topic debates about marginalized groups\r\n\r\n**[Message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.**", "Yes I saw it, I can read. What I am having an issue with is the fact that you said sexuality is fluid and you didn\u2019t think she had discovered herself yet. But then you immediately switched to saying she\u2019s playing OP & OPs family, then accused her of lying about being a lesbian so she could sneak Ben over. I take issue with your assumption that OP\u2019s sister ever even deceived the family in the first place. I also don\u2019t understand how OP is NTA if you\u2019re willing to admit the sister hasn\u2019t figured herself out yet.", "Yes absolutely! Thank you for your kind words. I want to be there for her no matter what.\n\nThank you for explaining. I hope your family and friends have been supportive of you. After all, all of us are human and deserve compassion and understanding.\n\nThis past week I have been doing A BOATLOAD of reading and have come across asexual, pansexual, etc. So much to learn! \n\nHave a fabulous day and thank you again for taking the time to explain.\u2665\ufe0f\n\nETA: using the pronoun 'her' because she hasn't specified if she wants to be referred to as: she or they/them."]}
