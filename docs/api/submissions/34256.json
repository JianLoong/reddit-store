An adult is not likely to obey a command.", "NTA. She is being completely unreasonable and disrespectful right now. Not only should she take the photo down, but she owes you a pretty hefty apology. There is no reality in which posting pictures online without someone's consent is okay, but it's even worse when the person has specifically and explicitly said that they don't want the photos online and asked to have them taken down. You are not overreacting and if she is this disrespectful on your feelings and boundaries, she is not the kind of partner you deserve.", "You privacy online is a right not a request and so you should absolutely percist when you want it to be taken down. \n\nYou should do therapy together if she doesn\u2019t get that. \nIts perfectly legal for her to do that so you don\u2019t have grounds there but if she\u2019s ready to compromise your relationship over a photo then you should leave because it\u2019s not a good relationship anyways", "Don't let her take any more photos of you.

Sounds like you are overreacting, meaning the photo is likely not that bad. Okay?! Sure, you can still not want it online, but it\u2019s a petty hill to die on in this day and age.", "Feelings are always valid. Reactions are what we\u2019re talking about. Don\u2019t confuse the two. \n\nIts a hairline. If Op was talking about a child being posted against the parents wishes, a case of DV, someone being outed, jeopardize someone\u2019s safety. But\u2026 its a hairline. \n\nYa\u2019ll need to take a step back from some of these posts sometimes and realize not everything is some massive conflict", "So again you can't answer the question. How is it overreacting to not want a photo of myself online?", "You obviously aren\u2019t understanding. Maybe the photo isn\u2019t that bad but OP didn\u2019t want it posted. That is not an overreaction. My boyfriend also hates his hairline and I never post a photo without his consent because I know how it would make him feel."]}
