Turned out there fentanyl in the edible he ate, but he ended up being alright. So I\u2019m really glad I went and got someone. \n\nBut then once he was ok, he was suspended from school for a week, which was expected. And our other friends were all super pissed with me about it. He was mad at first too because of the suspension but he isn\u2019t now and he thanks me for getting someone to help. \n\nI\u2019ve been thinking about this recently because I\u2019m still getting called a piece of shit for this.

You in all seriousness may have saved your friends life.", "NTA\n\nYour friends are idiots.\n\nNever ever doubt helping a friend. It's always better to have a friend angry at you than for them to be dead. It's easy to understand why your friend that took the edible was initially upset/angry because of the suspension (no one likes getting suspended), but if now he's cool with it and realized that you probably saved his life, why the hell do your other friends care?\n\nAre they so selfish that they would've rather your edible eating friend died than for him to get help and then getting suspended for doing something he's not supposed to be doing at school?\n\nDon't let them get to you, just know you did the right thing to help a friend, and if even that friend is cool with it now, their opinions don't matter.\n\nNext time they bring it up, ask them if they wanted him dead instead?", "NTA\n\nWell then, I guess you\u2019re a much better person then any of them. You DON\u2019T need them and I think you flat out outgrew this friendship anyway. Really makes you wonder though. What if it were YOU that was dosed? Would they have gotten help right away, or would they have \u201chid the evidence\u201d to protect themselves first cause you know, \u201cdon\u2019t snitch\u201d. \n\nDon\u2019t sweat it OP. They\u2019re actually doing you a favor by not associating with you cause now you can go out and find decent people to connect with. People who understand a persons life is more important then \u2018not snitching\u201d. \n\nI\u2019ll tell you one thing though, just give it a couple of years. They\u2019ll be extremely ashamed and embarrassed  of how they treated you, especially the friend who\u2019s LIFE YOU SAVED. Or not. Maybe they\u2019ll continue with their selfishness an led try even more harden substances. Putting themselves and others in more danger. Then you\u2019ll really know how big of a bullet it truly was that you dodged with this group. Who knows. Only time will tell.", "NTA but your friends are.

You didn't want to tell on him, but his life was worth more to you thsn the social consequences. You did the hard thing to be a good friend.

It\u2019s hard to see through the eyes of someone your not yet relating to. Your friend who was affected by it doesn\u2019t blame you for it and that\u2019s what matters.

Your friend needs to tell the others that. Not you. This needs to come from him. He needs to tell the others what happened in the ER.
