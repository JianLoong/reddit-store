You don't need to worry about anything other than making sure the happiness between you and your partner is fulfilled. Weddings are stressful enough already (going through the process myself) and just having that hanging anxiety is not going to help. You are not obligated to invite specific people, even if they are family. You should begin setting boundaries and absolutely not allow her to be at your wedding. I would recommend discussing the matter with your significant other to determine the best way to go about it. Congratulations, by the way!", "NTA - you know that if she is allowed to attend she will cause some kind of scene, and so does everyone else it seems. You don't need any of that on your special day!\n\nIt sounds like you should hire security in case she tries to crash anyway (because she sounds like the sort who would), make sure you have all your vendors and locations locked down with passwords so only you can change anything, and make sure any dresses etc are locked up safely where they cannot be got at by anyone other than you.\n\nSometimes relationships *should* end, and the fault is on her side.

They know. Her game is up. You were probably the last person she could reliably manipulate, and now it\u2019s over. \n\nI think if you do invite her that everyone, and I mean everyone, in your community will rally to help you. I think if she makes a scene that everyone will dismiss her, someone will pull her aside, everyone will unite to make this day about you. Frankly, I think this could be a really positive thing. Also, if you tell 2-3 close people who you respect that you\u2019re worried about this, they will probably volunteer to help handle her if needed. \n\nIn some ways I think this is the best option, because it would make a few things clear to her and establish what\u2019s what. If you don\u2019t invite her then she really gets the play the victim, might get some others on her side, and also might feel vindicated by getting revenge in a cruel way (messing with your wedding intentionally somehow). \n\nI think you\u2019re absolutely NTA if you don\u2019t want her there though.

Make her a Maid of honour or give her a significant role in the wedding, a speech or dance that requires planning and effort something that she knows will put the spotlight on her, but make sure it is at the end of the wedding, this way she may behave throughout the wedding.

Don\u2019t invite her to your birthday, Christmas, Thanksgiving or any other event. Cut her from your life.  She adds nothing but misery to you and the ones you care about.\n\nBeing related by blood doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s owed a relationship or even to be called family.  She\u2019s an abuser and bully.  She has made it clear she\u2019s not sorry and that she won\u2019t change.

Don\u2019t back down.  Do the following:\n1. Talk to your therapist.  This is going to be a bumpy ride, but well worth. A therapist will help you stand up and maintain your boundaries, and also see through the guilt and manipulation your sister will throw at you. \n2. Hire security for your venue and let the venue she is not allowed to be there.\n3. With the help of your therapist, write her an email that you are going no contact, why, she\u2019s uninvited from the wedding, and police will be called if she shows up.\n4. Create a blanket statement that you can text back to any of the flying monkeys she sends after you.  Make it clear you will not tolerate any abuse and block them too if they don\u2019t back off.\n5. Get security cameras for your home.\n6. Warn your work about her.\n7. Freeze your credit.  She often asks for money.  She may try to take out loans and credit cards in your name. \n\nI\u2019m so proud of you for reaching out.  You can do this.  You deserve to be free of her.

Then, if/when your sister does this, the winner gets up & yells, \"I won! I called 'panic attack!'\" & the rest of you in on the game applauds & congratulates the winner, turning the attention & drama from away from your sister.
