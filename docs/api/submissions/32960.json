Going NC and handling PTSD causes severe anxiety and this would have kept all your attention. In 2 years you wouldn't have remembered about your wedding because anxiety makes you focus on the issue only, leaving no space for anything else. There's a reason why lack of memory is related to anxiety.\n\nIt's been a huge decision, but ultimately you did your very best to protect yourself. NTA", "As someone who has been through the same thing, NTA. a lot of the comments really have no idea what living with cPTSD is like. \n\nFor my husband and I, we ended up only having two guests each and then a party 6 months later that we labelled the \u2018pretend day\u2019 so we wouldn\u2019t mind if things went wrong as we had less emotion invested (which helped when things went wrong - at least it wasn\u2019t the real day!)\n\nSo, if you want to see the rest of your family, this could be an option for you many months later with full expectation of problems and an escape plan. God, it sucks always having an escape plan, doesn\u2019t it?\n\nfor people who don\u2019t know: when cPTSD is triggered, it can take days, weeks or even months to even feel real again. We can end up bed bound. It is like being trapped in fear. It is hideous. She will not be able to experience her wedding day, even if security manage to take them away. It\u2019s not her fault, it\u2019s a scientifically proven bodily reaction. \n\nWe can usually live happy lives, but if our abusers come back, our body reacts from years of abuse. You cannot control or escape it - only learn coping mechanisms to live with it and sooth it. To the people saying we\u2019re not stable enough to marry  - we deserve to be happy. I am happily married (16 years). We were children who were abused and didn\u2019t ask to be born, are you really saying that abused children should never grow to be happy? Just because the mere sight of our abusers rightly petrifies us? To you in the comments (I can\u2019t believe how many I read) really think about what you are saying there. It\u2019s sick. \n\nOP- I am so happy you have found your chosen family. I am so sorry someone did this. I lost the rest of my family from flying monkeys, so I feel your pain.", "NTA.

Not a lot of people saw what was going on, so they don't understand why I've cut them off, and have tried to set up reconciliations. It is an arrogance I can't get my head around.\n\n I'm sorry someone in your family has done this to you. It's so hard to trust when your own parents and family don't protect you growing up.  I don't blame you for doing everything you can to protect yourself now. They might be uncomfortable in some way, but you've carried the burden of the discomfort for long enough.", "This isn't going to work unless you cancel your entire wedding.\n\nI have no idea how long it's been for you but I walked away from mine 30 years ago.  Whenever word would get back to me that my mother had acquired some information about my location or number I'd just shrug and respond that if she wanted to waste her time and energy tracking down my contact info she was welcome to have it... she just wasn't welcome to use it.  This approach worked well for me.\n\nReading this, you are still allowing your mother far more power than she deserves.  The best vengeance against a narcissist is for them to be irrelevant.  This action tells her that she still has power over you and merely feeds her ego.  And gives her a sympathetic audience of disinvitees for her \"woe is me\" schtick.\n\nI'm a huge fan of \"fake it until you make it\".  It's hard... but I promise that if you put on a front that she really is that irrelevant every single time you are faced with any scenario, one day you will realize that you are no longer pretending.  She really doesn't matter.\n\nAnd... you don't need other people to approve of your choices.  Only you need to approve of them.  Worrying about what others think of your decisions with regards to your mother is a quick way to feeling exactly as you currently feel... panicked and anxious.\n\nWere it me, I'd hire a couple of security guards to stand outside or just inside the door so she never makes it across the threshhold to disrupt you and carry on with your day exactly as you would if she knew nothing about it.\n\nI'm not going to make an asshole determination because there is no need to do so.  This is just life advice from someone who's been there.", "NTA and I would just elope to somewhere fun and tell no one", "Not going to judge since only you know your family and how bad it is.  But be prepared to not be forgiven by those who didn't do it. For them to not care about your updates and photos afterward since you shut them out with the guilty.

If people knew you were no contact with your parents, then they Should Not have told them all the details", "NTA.  I've had to block family on social media for leaking information to family that we are NC with.  Being betrayed by your family just reopens the old wounds.", "Yeesh, I\u2019m conflicted.\n\nINFO: How did you learn that they found out in the first place? Is it possible in any way that your parents found out through other means? Or that they bullied a relative into spilling this information?\n\nObviously, have the wedding you want but this sounds *nuclear*. I think that email is just going to create even more problems for you. Be prepared for LOTS of arguments and fallouts as a result of this drastic action.", "NTA \n\nI guess. There\u2019s likely many unintended consequences for going nuclear - like alienating the good relatives you used to have solid relationships with, but you already knew that. Maybe step back and have private conversations with the ones you want to remain close to - perhaps even let them secretly attend.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t be so harsh on your family though - especially ones that may not have directly seen how your parents treated you that cause such intense hatred towards them. If 10 family members know, \ud83d\udcaf% chance it\u2019ll get back to your parents - assuming some of them remain friends - or at least cordial - with them. Not excusing them, but keeping your wedding a secret while inviting a bunch of relatives doesn\u2019t seem realistic.\n\nAlso, people who haven\u2019t experienced abuse, often can\u2019t comprehend the damage that\u2019s done. I have a friend who was sexually and physically abused and another physically abused whose friends and relatives want them to reconcile 20 years later since the parents are old and that was in the distant past. Yeah - fuck that. And fuck any of your relatives who just don\u2019t get it. They don\u2019t deserve to be in your life anymore.", "NTA\n\nThat was a well written email.", "NTA - but your side of the family are definitely TA. This makes me wonder what other information is being leaked or accidentally leaked by them. As someone who has to change their email, phone, constantly check their social media to make sure my mom has no idea what my life is like I feel for you. This is your day. The non guilty family members should completely understand and should try to do something for you when you get back from your honeymoon. The ones that complain the loudest are most likely the guilty ones. NC means NC and no one has the right to say anything to them about you good or bad. That is a huge boundary. I personally had to cut my aunt who I love out of my life because she would mean well and try to brag about how good I was doing to my mom\u2026 I begged her to stop and gave her warnings and finally cut her out as well for enabling details of my personal life to go to someone who actively tries to harm me. \n\nStay strong and enjoy your new family you get by marriage", "NTA. It\u2019s unfortunate that it had to be done, but this situation fits that old saying \u201cone bad apple ruins the bunch.\u201d Whoever made the decision to betray you and your future spouse to your abusers knowingly did so, and as a consequence ruined the ability to attend for everyone else.\n\nYou also extended the generosity of reimbursing those uninvited for anything they\u2019ve spent related to the occasion, which is incredibly kind.", "Nope!  That was fabulous.  Congratulations", "This is why going NC with your parents, but not your relatives, rarely works. OP\u2019s parents probably cry to the whole family about how \u201cwe miss OP so much. We don\u2019t even know what we did\u2026.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s always someone who tries to \u201cfix it\u201d or can\u2019t keep their mouth shut. I know two people who tried to go NC with just their parents, and both times the person ended up NC with the entire extended family.\n\nUnless you can present evidence that leads to everyone also going NC with your parents on your behalf, this will keep happening. It\u2019s unrealistic to think everyone will side with you and conspire to keep your secrets.", "Hey OP, NTA.\n\nHere's an idea. Reach out to some of the people you suspect may have leaked the info, give each of them a different update saying the date/location has changed and see which of these get back your parents. You will then know who leaked the information based on the updates that get back to your parents and you can cut whomever told them out of your life for good.\n\nEdit: clarity and spelling", "NTA\n\nHowever \u201cbut am close with many relatives\u201d may very well change drastically.\n\nAnd we can all say \u201cbut if they truly love OP they\u2019ll accept it\u201d. I wouldn\u2019t count on it. \n\nUnderstand this is a nuclear option. And on the happiest day of your life you will have no one from your side of the family all because of two people. Even now they are controlling and impacting your life. \n\nMy recommendation? Get a shit ton of security and have your family there. Hell, if they\u2019re dumb enough to show up - get a glass of champagne and enjoy the show of them getting tossed out on their asses. If any of your family objects? They get tossed as well.
