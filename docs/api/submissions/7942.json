People don't go back to using intentionally. I suppose the actual wedding part, though.\n\n\\[Edit:\\] Oh, your question about being unapologetic. Ehhhh, you're not insulting her. I think honesty is important.", "Dude.\nMy dude.\nYou have been dating for *TWO WEEKS*, and she is already talking about long term commitments like marriage? I would run away So Fast.\nNTA, but if she is already demanding major lifestyle changes this soon, and reacting like that when you 'slip up', this relationship should not last.", "NTA. If drinking is a deal breaker it\u2019s best you part ways now. Changing your behaviour for your partner to this extent two weeks into a relationship is alarming and a red flag. End things now.", "ESH\n\nShe made unreasonable demands on your lifestyle, and you never should have agreed to them.", "I mean...yall have been together for 2 weeks and she's talking about children and not wanting them to have a drunkard father?\n\nDude, run.\n\nNTA", "Dude wtf, love yourself more and realize your are in a toxic af relationship. NTA for the drink, YTA to yourself.", "NTA.  She's making demands after TWO WEEKS?!?  Dude, run.", ".....two weeks in and she's talking about marriage and kids ? if she's being this controlling now i can only imagine it getting worse over things much less serious than alcohol. 100% NTA", "2 weeks? Dude! \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "Is she hot? I can't think of any other reason you would be with her. Telling you not to drink at all? You do not share the same basic values. You do not belong together.", "She got something in her past bothering her and you should run because the sex isn't worth it in the long run...", "First it will be the drinking, next it will be something else. Leg it.", "Sounds like she came from an alcoholic home so i can understand her concern. I was married to a severe alcoholic for many years so i get it. But those are her issues to deal with and not for her to tell you you can't drink. It's been 2 weeks. Don't waste your time. I still drink though not often. I am not planning on putting any drinking restrictions on any future partners. But if they show me they have a problem I'm simply just our of there", "NTA\nGTFO\nToxic", "Big red flags here, get out  now", "ESH. It's ok to have a drink or two and not feel ashamed about it but you did agree to her (totally unreasonable but she can ask, can't she?) request. Next time maybe don't agree to do things you don't want to do just to get a gf. It's ok for her to feel betrayed because you did agree to abstain.", "Run!", "This is frankly bizarre. After 2 weeks she\u2019s not even really your girlfriend yet, and she\u2019s already expecting you to abide by a \u201crule\u201d that you don\u2019t agree with for kids who don\u2019t exist? You both sound very immature, but regardless, you should just break up with her. You are NTA.", "NTA", "NTA, dude if only 2 weeks in she's already trying to control you based on nonexistent future children you need to RUN fast and far from this headcase!", "Dude!  It has been only 2 weeks. Let he find someone else and you find someone more tolerant. No one at 2 weeks should control what you do!", "NTA. Two weeks in and she's already talking about kids and marriage. She's also very controlling. Unless you're a recovering alcoholic she has no right asking you to abstain.", "ESH but only because both of you are showing absolutely terrible judgment in even considering a long term relationship under these circumstances.", "2 weeks?  You are serious?  Don't be with people that blow up and berate you, please.", "NTA. Be glad you only wasted 2 weeks of your life with her & move on.", "ESH. She clearly has issues around alcohol to the point of being unreasonable and controlling. You agreed to her crazy demands then went and broke her trust behind her back.\n\nHonestly, i think you're not compatible and should go your separate ways. She should find someone who feels as strongly about alcohol as she does. You need to find someone who's ok with a fairly regular life involving alcohol.", "NTA. Your girlfriend is a nut and trying to exert insane levels of control over a two-week-old relationship. Now she's been alternating between berating you and talking about marriage (again, in a two-week-old relationship). She's a fucking lunatic. This has abusive behavior red flags everywhere. Cut bait and run for the fucking hills before you get baby trapped. You do not want your next 18-19 years to be tied to raising a child with this psycho.", "NTA", "NTA why is she telling you what to at 2 weeks", "ESH.\n\nYou agreed to her position and then lied. That's pretty bad.\n\nShe has been your girlfriend of TWO WEEKS and is already trying to modify your behavior, which is worse. It sounds like your girlfriend may have some serious past trauma related to alcohol. She needs therapy _before_ she can have a serious relationship with someone. Y'alls values don't align; breaking up is the best option.", "ESH - only because you agreed then caved. She sucks most for being controlling AF and it\u2019s only been *2 weeks* lol! Honestly WTF?\n\nAt any rate your issue is that you cave in to peer pressure too easily. Get a spine my dude, dump her and learn to say no to stuff and stick to it", "ESH. It\u2019s out of line for her to ask that from you, so arguably she sucks more, but you agreed. You didn\u2019t have to, but you did. So you did, in fact, break her trust.", "Clarification, I'm not an alcoholic, I have one or two every now and again.", "And talking about marriage and children together. All of it is terrifying. Sounds like the kind of girl who would baby trap him and try to control his life.", "The flag is RED.", "Right? SO many red flags", "Run as fast you can from her.", "Reminds me when I was in my early 20s and met a girl through a computer dating site.  We\u2019re having dinner and she\u2019s freaking out cuz I had ONE glass of wine.  She confesses that her ex was an alcoholic but kept asking if I was going to genre a second glass.  After the date was over I hauled ass out of there\u2026", "Holy smokes 2 weeks and she\u2019s your GF and making demands like this???  RUN LIKE THE WIND", "Clarification I'm not an alcoholic, I drink recreationally and I've only been drunk once and never again. I drink well within my limits and its mostly to be human with others around me and not alienate myself.", "I think this is a fair comment, op badly needs a backbone. Then he needs to break up with his controlling gf.", "Clarification, I'm not an alcoholic I have one or two *only* every now and then which Is well within my tolerance. I can say no under extreme circumstances I don't just \"rip through\". We've known each other for like 5 months.", "Thank you!", "No drinking problem, just one or two every now and again. I don't think I've left anything out either. Honestly I do see it as a red flag, I don't know why but I chose to ignore it at the time, now I'm re-thinking.", "Thank you!", "Yep, that was a ridiculous thing to agree to. If someone is an alcoholic, a promise won't work, and if they aren't an alcoholic, they shouldn't have to commit to that.", "Nope nope nope. She is making unreasonable demands. He needs to stand up for himself.", "Lol first pressured into not drinking, then pressured into slipping up and drinking...", "Yeah, then there\u2019s no excuse for her being this way :/ Something\u2019s up.", "> I've continually backed out of situations that she's put me in where I might slip.\n\nIf she's forcing you to not drink, and simultaneously putting you in that position, she's either setting you up to fail so she can throw a fit, or somehow \"testing\" you and the relationship. The girl is toxic.", "Run as fast as you can! Next she\u2019s going to tell when to eat and sleep.. she definitely has control issues", "Very soft YTA in that if you're honesty I'm pretty sure you knew you never were going to stick to no alcohol, and you should have told her that straight up and found out why she is worried about alcoholic fathers (my guess, she grew up with one).  Also, though, what is this 'we've been together 2 weeks' and she's talking about \"our possible children\"!  That is not so very healthy.  I'd guess she's hypervigilant about all men and alcohol.  You need to either break up with her, or set clear and honest boundaries (I am going too drink of I want to, I'm not going to be a drunkard, it's waaaay too early to think about 'our possible children' relax, and enjoy being young' and havea serious conversation about where her fears come from", "That flag is not only red, it's become a shade of infrared only visible to FLIR devices and mantis shrimp.  Dude needs to flee this relationship yesterday.", "Ahh, y\u2019all must be church folk. NTA man, far from it. You\u2019re responsible with your booze, and it was a special event. You literally did no harm. You didn\u2019t even get drunk. Not a reason for your girlfriend to lay into you in my opinion.", "It's a bit concerning that you think you need to drink to be human. I've never been a big drinker and no one has ever made me feel weird about it. For context I've had alcohol twice in the last year and that was a lot for me. \n\nBut your girlfriend's behavior is more concerning. It sounds like she has a history with alcoholism, like a family member. She may not have the experience to understand that it doesn't have to be all or nothing for most people. If you want to be serious with her this is a discussion you need to have. She shouldn't be policing your behavior like that any more than you should do it to her.\n\nNTA", "Thanks. I just wanted to have a fuller picture. I think you're NTA and should probably cut your losses on this one.", "It's easy to ignore red flags when you really like someone, everyone is guilty of that at some point, but yikes, this one is just a walking red flag.", "Like I could maybe agree to something along those lines but I have a drink like once a year. There are other things I couldn't follow through on so I don't agree to them.\n\nI do find it rather interesting that most here seem to just think the GF is controlling and no one noticed how OP agreed to be sober before the relationship.", "It's fine if he doesn't want to be sober 24/7 he just has to tell her that and not pretend to agree to her terms. That could just mean they aren't compatible and have to end things.", "Yup Stand up", "Lol we are. It sucks that this will affect our environment as well. Thank you for your input!", "No one is compatible with the demands of a toxic controlling person. He doesn't need to offer explanations or give advance notice of his intentions. He needs, like all mofos everywhere, to refuse to give his rights over to a demanding romantic partner.", "I didn't say he had to justify anything just be honest from the beginning that he wasn't going to be sober. That's fine. She asked him if he could do it before they started dating. It was a deal breaker for her. That's also fine. He knew he wasn't about that life but told her he would be sober anyway. That's an AH move.\n\nIt's not controlling or toxic to have deal breakers. She let him know before the relationship began she had this deal breaker. It wasn't sprung on him right before the trip or something she lost her shit about while he had no clue. He could have just not dated her or told her he could do that and let her decide how much of a deal breaker it actually was.", "She set a boundary - I don\u2019t date people who drink. He said ok I won\u2019t drink. Then drank. \n\nYou\u2019re right, she doesn\u2019t get to monitor him or have to give advanced notice for what he\u2019s going to do. But if he knows he drinks, he shouldn\u2019t enter into a relationship with someone who doesn\u2019t date people who drink. \n\nIt\u2019s like saying you don\u2019t date smokers and your new partner says \u201c No problem, I don\u2019t smoke\u201d. But then goes to a party and smoked a pack of cigarettes. Personally I\u2019d be pretty annoyed they said they don\u2019t smoke/were willing not to smoke then did so 2 weeks into the relationship. \n\nIt\u2019s not about limited his ability to party and live his life. It\u2019s about mutually agreeing to a boundary he then crossed.", "I don't touch a doodle flap of anyone who eats fajitas or listens to audio books.", "You don't understand the difference between boundaries and controlling demands. A boundary is something like \"I won't be talked to like that\" controlling shit is \"I won't date a person who jumps on a trampoline.\"", "K, just don't be surprised if your dating pool a bit limited.\n\nOn a personal note I do both those things all the time so it probably wouldn't work out between us.", "I do, actually. OP\u2019s girlfriend isn\u2019t telling him where to go, what to wear, who to speak to. \n\nShe set a personal boundary \u201cI do not date people who drink\u201d. If OP found that controlling or did want to drink, then he shouldn\u2019t date her because they aren\u2019t compatible. \n\nThis wasn\u2019t sprung on OP, he knew going in and agreed.", "No, she met a person... not a puppet. She's dating the dude standing in front of her. He isn't an unopened can of playdough.", "Don't get me started on my bound boundaries, I only paperback that ass.", "Well so is he, and she said she doesn\u2019t date people who drink so\u2026..", "\"I don't date people who weigh more than 150 lbs\"", "So if you enter into a relationship and say \u201clook in cool with drinking and weed, but I\u2019m not ok with heroin\u201d and 2 weeks in the dude does heroin. You\u2019re controlling for not being ok with that?"]}
