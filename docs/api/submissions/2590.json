You very well know that she didn't mean \"keep bringing random people over, just knock on my bedroom door and wake me up in the middle of the night so I can get a good look at the person you're about to bone\"\n\nSounds like she is doing you a favor by letting you stay in her home. You're acting like a doorknob", "YTA.\n\nThis isn\u2019t fighting over toys when you\u2019re 6 and 10. She said she\u2019s uncomfortable with all these girls staying that she doesn\u2019t know, in HER house. So your solution is to knock on her bedroom door, breach her privacy with said stranger and introduce them. You think they now know each other? Are you a sandwich short of a picnic? \n\nStop taking the piss, it\u2019s your sisters house and her rules. Go find somewhere else to have your apparent copious amounts of exploits.", "YTA. Your sister told you she doesn't want people she doesn't know constantly coming into her home. Respect her wishes.", "YTA\n\nGet your own place or bring your hookups to a hotel room. \n\nShe doesn't want you bringing random hookups to her home. And if you really thought that she meant that she wanted you to introduce them to her, you're really naive. She clearly feels uncomfortable.", "YTA \n\nYour sister doesn't want a bunch of strangers coming in and out of her home.  Go to your hookups house or something. \n\nFrankly I would be pissed too and on the verge of kicking you out", "If I was her, I\u2019d start recording and say you asked your sister to witness and record a verbal confirmation that the sex was consensual after \u201cwhat happened last time.\u201d Repeat as needed. Also YTA", "Bro........first yes YTA. Second, bro........she was nicely telling you to quit bringing 1 night stands over. SHE. WAS. NOT. WANTING. TO. MEET. THEM. Again, bro........", "YTA. Hahaha. She says she's uncomfortable with all these girls she doesn't know coming and you think she wants to be introduced to them.", "Yes of course YTA, obviously.  Your sarcastic response to her very reasonable concern only made things worse.\n\nKnowing someone and knowing someone's name are different things.", "YTA. Stop using your sisters home as a sex pad.", "YTA\u2026. She means stop bring girls home from the bar that you don\u2019t know. That\u2019s rude as shit to do. You wanna hook up with people go their house or find a cheap motel/hotel close to the bar you are at", "YTA 1) not your house and 2) your behaviour made your sister uncomfortable and your answer was to make her more uncomfortable.\n\nHook up somewhere else or get your own place.", "YTA - the problem wasn't that your sister hadn't been introduced to the girls- it was that she felt uncomfortable having her space constantly invaded. Sounds like you are sharing her space - meaning she probably pays most of the bills/ has the responsibility of things like rent, utilities, etc. Even if this is a place you are both equal tenants in- how often you both have people over and the type of relationship you have with those people is absolutely something that you and your roommate should discuss and agree on.\nIt's rude them to continue to engage in behavior that makes her uncomfortable when she has asked that you stop doing that. Rent a hotel room, get your own place, or go to these girl's places instead. If you don't do this - you're probably going to get kicked out.", "YTA\n\nSaying she doesn't want girls she doesn't know coming over for sex doesn't mean it's ok if you tell her their name\n\nYou want multiple random hook up that's your choice but either move to a place of your own (or with a roommate who is ok with that), go to the woman's place or spring for a hotel room", "You can't be this dense. YTA. Your sister isn't saying that she wants to *meet* every girl you slepe with. She's saying she doesn't want you to bring strange girls back to her home..... \n\nIf you wanna hook up with randos that's cool but do it at THEIR house. Don't disrespect your sister by bring strangers to her home.", "YTA.\n\nHow much depends on how much you\u2019re a roommate vs. a brother staying at his sister\u2019s place but in either case you\u2019re pushing it.", "YTA get your own place", "YTA\n\nI think your sister meant that she doesn't want you bringing girls over, or at least as frequently as you do.", "INFO: Does she own the house and is just letting you stay there?\n\nRight now, I'm thinking YTA.  I feel like you are trying to punish her for telling you she was uncomfortable by bothering her every time you have someone over.  She lives there, and has a right to be comfortable in her own home.  If I were you, I would figure out a different place to take your hookups.", "YTA. She said she didn't feel comfortable with all these people in her home, and your response was to make her meet them. That is only making it worse. I don't really understand why you thought that would be a good idea.", "I don't believe you don't see what you're doing as something very close to malicious compliance. This is classic sibling jerk behavior pushed to an extreme, at a time of life when a skosh more maturity--at least in some situations--would be good to demonstrate. Knock it off. YTA", "Info: do you pay rent? Did you ask your sister if you could have evening guests? I meaaaaan I\u2019m all for sexual freedom and what not but this isn\u2019t your home. I get you were trying to introduce them to make things better but it almost comes off like malicious compliance.", "YTA. Seriously?", "YTA. Not only is it inconsiderate but it\u2019s also a security risk. Bringing a bunch of randoms to HER place means that a bunch of people SHE doesn\u2019t know knows where SHE lives. All it takes is one case of stalking from one of your escapades and you\u2019ve put her in a shitty situation. You need to figure out another smash pad. Soon.", "YTA. Get your own place.", "YTA - you knew she meant stop brining so many girls home to fuck not introduce them to me. You petty little shit.", "YTA Has is occurred to you that your sister doesn't wanna hear you have sex ?", "YTA. This is kinda funny, but come on. Can't afford your own place, don't invite strangers", "If I was the sister I would say hi and sit down and start talking for her for hours until she\u2019s too tired to sleep with him. Revenge.\nEdit: forgot to add judgement. YTA.", "YTA, but it might be a misunderstanding in your communication with your sister.\n\nConsider that every time you bring a new person into your shared space she feels a bit more uncomfortable as each one is a new chance of something being taken or broken. She said that she didn't like all of the strangers, but bringing someone to her door while you're both drunk and about to smash doesn't do anything to break that \"stranger barrier\". It seems like it may have just been happening too often for her and she's gotten a bit fed up. See if you can try to go to the girl's place sometimes as well to at least try and be a bit respectful of your shared space.", "Lol...your sister is just icked out hearing your sex noises.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But if its her place then she does.", "YTA and this almost also belongs in malicious compliance.

This just strikes close to home for me.. my brother is my best friend and his (now ex girlfriend ) stole quite a few things from me in my apartment and things that I left at my mothers home. I just know if someone I knew for years could steal and make me feel uncomfortable, a random hookup would probably set my anxiety on high alert. I think you just need to respect your sister and see that she was nicely asking you to do this elsewhere. You wouldn\u2019t want a random hookup to ruin your awesome relationship with your sister.", "How do you know? Do you kick them out as soon as you're done?", "I guess I could but seems better to invite them to mine lol", "No but by the time we are sleeping it\u2019s like 3-4", "It isn't really yours is it? It's your sister's and she said to stop...", "That's the problem. It's not yours. It's your sister's.", "Except it isn\u2019t really yours. What you are doing is inviting them to your sisters. What sounds better \u201chey do you wanna come back to my sisters house and hook up?\u201d Or \u201chey, do you wanna take this back to your place?\u201d Because really those are the two options you have, and yes YTA for always bringing randoms back to your sisters place when she has said it makes her uncomfortable.", "So theoretically, between 3-4 and whatever time you get up, you have no idea WHAT they're doing", "I mean I guess so. Nothing has never gone missing.", "It\u2019s not even just stealing as a potential threat.  I vaguely remember a college hook up where I then went and puked my brains out at around 5 am - vaguely aware that I was definitely in some girl\u2019s bathroom, vomiting in her toilet, and about to clean up with her towels all because I was hooking up with some dude she lived with.  Adult me *cringes*"]}
