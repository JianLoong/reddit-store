Or it's malicious compliance.", "This isn't a stunt, this is making a woman feel uncomfortable and perhaps unsafe in her own home so you can have a laugh and get laid.   \n\n\nYou're not as funny or clever as you seem to think you are.  \n\n\nYTA", "But are you going to stop bringing your hookups home? Or continue being an asshole?", "You are both growing up, so should the relationship. Jabs are fine when its two of you but when you start using strangers to embarrass your family that's when the relationship goes down hill . All the childhood closeness is destroyed by adult boundaries stomping .YAH", "I agree, but poor sister seems very tolerant of this BS if it\u2019s gone on this long already.", "Cause you have eyes on them the whole time?  I find it extremely hard to believe that a guy who's coming home drunk with drunk women isn't just passing out and is completely aware of everything his \"date\" is doing while she's over.  Literally all someone would have to do is say they were going to go to the bathroom, steal something, then come back to your room.  You are being intentionally ignorant of the risk of consistently bringing random people into your house, just as you were being willfully ignorant to the meaning of what your sister said when she said she doesn't want random girls she doesn't know in the house.", "Absolutely. Oh you don\u2019t want them to be people you don\u2019t know? Ok, I\u2019ll wake you up to meet them.\n\nVery bad idea to pull malicious compliance on someone who\u2019s letting you live with them, however.", "U know not everyone is autistic .

Would then also have the social skills to also keep meeting women at bars and taking them home.  Remember how it's like...hard to connect with people when you're autistic?\n\nNo this was a total \"fuck you I'll do what I want\" mov\" and (he asks to ask us if he's an AH?)\n\nEither that or OP has Syphilis....", "I've never known an autistic person to bang a ton of randos. I'm not saying it couldn't happen but find it highly unlikely.", "So OP is either a moron or an AH.", "This is a great point. Some people like to be all \u201cbut EVERYONE deserves XYZ even if they\u2019re poor\u201d but the truth is that there\u2019s a line between still enjoying life and just being unnecessarily wasteful of money. \n\nAlcohol and hookups to that extent don\u2019t contribute anything to your life or long term happiness. OP, check your priorities. \n\nYou\u2019re not entitled to bringing strangers into a house that you share, never mind a house that isn\u2019t yours entirely. Grow up and understand that getting drunk and hooking up are PRIVILEGES, not rights.", "He doesn't. He just wants people to stop telling him YTA.", "Cuz he just wants to brag about his hookups. He doesn't want judgment.", "The point wasn\u2019t \u201cthis is all okay cause it might be explained by autism, adhd, anxiety, antisocial, or any other reason someone might struggle with social cues or rules\u201d.
