Its a passive agressive move.", "YTA - I had this issue with my ex when we had to live together for a time as we were both on the lease. He would bring girls home and when I said I didn't want strangers in the house he would wait until I got home and introduce them. He never understood I was worried for my safety, his safety, my possessions, our property. It's not about you, so stop being a selfish AH.\n\nOnce I started offering them rides home (because they were out of their minds drunk and he was clearly taking advantage), he stopped bringing them back.", "You are the absolute, complete asshole.", "Dude \u2026\n\nYTA", "I think you knew what she meant \n\nYTA \n\nShow some respect", "Lol.  Of course.  You know YTAH.  Totally,  you know.  Without a doubt YTA.", "YTA. I get it you are young and don\u2019t want a relationship, perhaps you are doing this so often that it has made your sister uncomfortable.

Just imagine if the  situation was reveresed and you herd the live parade going  full throttle in the other room while your trying to sleep. im sure it would make you uncomfortable.

She doesn\u2019t like so many strangers coming into\nher home. I wouldn\u2019t either.

It isn't just your home, it's hers, too.", "Dude seriously? You have no clue and have to ask...yeah YTA. You know even girls can be bat sh!t crazy. Your sister means stop bringing randos to HER place. It's fine you don't want a serious relationship while in college but you need to go to the place of the girl(s) you're hooking up with. Your sister doesn't want everyone in the town knowing her address and what she has in her apartment (that might be worth stealing).

Drinking at a bar is pricy and sounds like this is happening A LOT. YTA it\u2019s not your place, your sister has made it VERY CLEAR she is uncomfortable, and yet you continued.

I am leaning towards total ignorance. YWBTA if you don't go up to your sister, apologise for making her upset and ask her what OP is doing wrong.", "YTA she means stop bringing home randos. Get your own place", "YTA\n\nYou know very well what she meant. I would not be happy with a constant parade of strangers in my home.

She was tired of you bringing strangers into your home when you\u2019re drunk. Knowing their names wasn\u2019t the issue. And waking her up to introduce her to them only makes it worse.", "YTA She doesn\u2019t want to meet them. I can\u2019t believe you misinterpreted that to such a degree. Shaking hands is not *knowing* someone. She wants you to stop bringing a revolving door of one night stands thru your house, period. If she were doing this would you honestly be ok with it? Is there a reason you never go to their places?", "YTA. Sounds like you\u2019re doing this to spite her, otherwise you\u2019re just dumb as rocks. Grow up and stop bringing girls back.", "NAH- everyone is insisting you've deliberately 'misinterpreted', but I think you might just have misunderstood in an extremely silly way.

Definitely YTA.", "Right!\nLike let me keep brining theses strangers into not  my home that I don't know at all", "It's a home, and OP is treating it like a motel.
