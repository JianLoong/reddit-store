Unfortunately, my husband let our daughter borrow his car and then had an emergency at work so he had to use my car so my son and I had to take the bus. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t ideal, but I\u2019d rather the bus than miss an appointment. \n\nWhile it isn\u2019t my place to share why he goes to therapy, I will say that he will often forget to eat. I usually make sure he\u2019s fed, but due to the mess in the morning, it slipped my mind. \n\nThe bus wasn\u2019t too crowded but all the seats were taken. My son wasn\u2019t doing too well and I could tell he was feeling dizzy from hunger+the bus. So the second someone got off their seat, I sat him down. I then tried to find a chocolate bar I had in my bag. \n\nWhile this is happening, I noticed an elderly woman and her adult daughter standing beside us. I didn\u2019t pay much attention until the daughter tapped me on the shoulder. \n\nShe asked if my son could move so that her elderly mother could have a seat. I felt really bad, I really did, but my son was not doing great and standing would make it harder. I had found the chocolate and he was eating it slowly but if he stood up right then, I can assure you he would\u2019ve fainted. \n\nI apologized to her and explained that my son wasn\u2019t feeling well. \n\nShe rolled her eyes at me and said that she saw him standing earlier and that he\u2019s a young healthy teenage boy-he\u2019ll be fine. I apologized once again and told her that he wasn\u2019t feeling well and that if he was then HE himself would\u2019ve offered her a seat. \n\nThe daughter told me to look at her mother and I admit, the poor woman looked really tired. But I couldn\u2019t. My son had started to lean against me so I told the woman one last time that I was sorry and to ask someone else.\n\nI then heard them both whispering and calling me an entitled bitch. And when we got off the bus, a woman that got off with us said that a teenage boy can handle standing more than an elderly woman can and that she hopes someone treats me like that when I\u2019m her age. My son was so out of it, I don\u2019t think he even noticed or cared but I can\u2019t get this off my mind. AITA? A totally unrelated woman thought I was along with the two.\n\nI wasn\u2019t sitting down and did not have a seat.", "created_utc": 1675636991, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10upxdd/aita_for_not_letting_an_elderly_woman_have_my/", "score": 726, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You handled it the same way I would have, politely explaining that your son wasn't feeling well and needed to sit.  \n\n\nI'm sure there were many other people they could have asked, and many other people that could have offered, so I'm not sure why they felt the need to pick on you and your son.", "NTA.  \n\n\nHaving an \"invisible\" illness is the pits.  For just this very reason.  I too get these crashes on occasion, and there's no choice to it.  If I don't sit down and get something in me, a gatorade if nothing else, I ***WILL*** pass out.     \n\n\nI've been this way all my life, thin and chunky, (and yes, have been to billions of doctors over it....slight exaggeration).  99% of the time I manage it well, but sometimes forget to eat or think it's been a lot less time since last eating than it has been).", "NTA because reasonable people know that a disability or impairment is not always visible and not something that older people have. It sounds like you were polite to the mother and daughter and that they were unnecessarily rude.\n\nPeople are going to be rude and unreasonable sometimes, you don't need to justify your behaviour just because someone decided to be rude.\n\n(I asked for INFO earlier but it was answered elsewhere)", "NTA - sorry they were so rude to you  Often people have disabilities or illness that is not obvious from their appearance. Once you explained to them that your son had a need for the seat they should have backed off. After that it was their issue. Also, if the elderly woman needed a seat so bad they could have asked basically anyone on the bus who was able-bodied. It doesn't make any sense that he limited their search to one person because he was a teenage boy.", "Psa: she was not sitting in a seat therefore could not offer up her own seat", "Was every other seat taken by an elderly person? Seems ridiculous that your son had the only seat on the entire bus that could be given up. While it may not be your place to say what the issue is, or that you should even have to defend not giving up his seat, in situations like this, it might just save the fuss to say \u201csorry, we are on our way to a medical appointment and my son is not doing well. I\u2019m sure there is someone else on the bus who is capable of standing and can give up their seat, but my son is have a medical issue right now and he cannot stand.\u201d Hell, when I was 9 months pregnant, I gave my seat up to an elderly man. I\u2019m sure there was someone else, but you were unfortunately stereotyped and targeted because of his age. NTA.", "NTA. People who are older or with visible disabilities shouldn't assume that another younger passenger is able to stand, since they might have a hidden disability, shorter term injury, or might simply be ill/lightheaded at that time in question (after all, dizziness can be caused by low blood sugar, ear infections, migraines, motion sickness, and some medications, amongst other things - and if you are lightheaded or dizzy it is much harder to keep balance on a moving bus or train). \n\nI don't think that the elderly woman's daughter was necessarily wrong to ask if your son could give up his seat, but she should have accepted your response that he wasn't feeling well and moved, on rather than first trying to pressure/guilt you/your son into giving up his seat and then subsequently insult you for declining on your son's behalf.  \n\nI am confused, though, why the woman tapped you on the shoulder to ask *you* if your 17yo son could give up his seat, rather than address your son directly.", "NTA. If your son fainted on the bus he could have been seriously injured.  Keeping him seated was in the best interest of everyone on that bus.", "NTA. It\u2019s ridiculous to me they didn\u2019t ask anyone else. Hope your son is ok.", "NTA\n\nYour son had an legitimate reason to not offer his seat. Like you said, someone else simply should have offered their seat to the old lady.", "NTA. I've often notice a lot of people think the elderly are entitled to a lot more than they actually are. Your son was not feeling well he needed to sit. That's the end of the discussion. Everyone else's comments were uncalled for", "NTA. Just because someone look strong and healthy it doesn\u2019t mean they are.", "NTA, and I\u2019m sure there were other people on the bus who could have given up their seat for the old lady. Good on you for standing up for your son!", "NTA. We can't ever assume someone is fine to stand just because of their age. I'm in my 40s and get horrible motion sickness on buses, and when it hits me, I need to sit or else I may faint or vomit. If I'm feeling ok enough, I'm happy to give my seat to someone who needs it more than I do. You should not have had to explain that your son wasn't feeling well more than once. Honestly it sucks that someone else within earshot didn't just offer their seat.", "NTA. Not all disabilities are visible. You did your best to explain the situation and that there was a reason your son was in the seat. If they choose not to believe you there\u2019s not much you can do.", "Nta that person that got off the bus could have offer them their seat. Any other person could gave up that seat if they wanted to. Your son is nta and neither are you.", "NTA at all. You explained that your son wasnt feeling well. Also keep in mind that many disabilities are unnoticeable but still very difficult to live with which is why you should never assume someone's health status. Also im sure the bus had more seats and likely other healthier people who could get up if the lady needed a seat.", "NTA in any way. I\u2019m sure there were plenty of healthy people that could have easily given up their seat. Let this go. You did nothing wrong. Those entitled AHs need to realize you can\u2019t see every disability or issue", "NTA\nI have an immune disease but look perfectly fine.  Your son had as much a right to a seat as anyone else in need.", "NTA. On a crowded bus on an empty stomach, I've almost passed out myself, and I don't have the eating issues your son has. I think they should've just accepted your answer and asked someone else to move. \n\nThe real assholes were people observing the situation who chose to judge you instead of offering up their seats.", "NTA there were many other people they could have asked but instead tried to bully the teenage boy. \n\nI hope he is ok", "NTA given he wasn't medically able to at the time and I'm sure most of the people complaining could have, and chose not to", "Nta, you kindly explained the situation which sounds stressful. They had plenty of other people to ask", "NTA. That's ageism first of all ( discriminating against your son for his age)  nobody's business what someone's health conditions are, and not your responsibility to make someone's lives more comfortable at the expense of yours.\n\nGood on you for putting you son first", "You're NTA nor are you the entitled one. Why was that particular taken seat the only one she was demanding someone vacate?", "Honestly people will assume things but that only makes them the asshole. You explained your situation they didn\u2019t accept it, that\u2019s on them. \n\nIt\u2019s very annoying, my friend badly tore a ligament in her ankle and an \u201cold\u201d lady (60) asked her to move so she could sit. My friend was in pain and couldn\u2019t stand properly never mind walk. We tried pointing out her ankle bandage but she wasn\u2019t having it. \n\nPeople assume that because someone is younger that they should be more \u201cable bodied\u201d (if that\u2019s the right word).", "NTA faint or puke they would have realized it sooner or later and u just saved everyone the trouble", "NTA and you weren't the only ones on the bus.  Presumably there were other people who could have given their seat.  \n\nYour job was to look out for your son. Just like the woman was looking out for her mom.  She should have kept looking.", "NTA. Often in life, we come across circumstances where we must make hard decisions. It is perfectly ok to be selfish and choose the well being of your loved ones in those circumstances.   \nAlso, if she really wanted for her mother to sit, she could have requested someone else to vacate their seat. This ageist attitude has to stop.", "There are times when you just have to grit your teeth and assure yourself that you are right.  And ignore whatever criticism comes your way.  This is one of them.  You dont need to explain yourself.  Who care whatever anyone else thinks.  NTA", "Nta. Telling me that not a single able bodied person had occupied the whole load of seats on the bus? Its so rude to assume someone is healthier than you or more capable of something just because they are younger. I'm glad you stood your ground and protected your son. Ironic that daughter of old lady called you an entitled b*tch when that is exactly what she was.", "NTA.\n\nThere was no reason they couldn't just ask someone else. It was purely because he's young they asked, which is fine, but no means no. If someone's that adamant on not giving up their seat, obviously something's wrong. Most people stand without issue. \n\nAnyone in the near vicinity that heard the conversation could have stood up too. \n\nCompassion goes both ways. \n\nIf it makes you feel better, I have medical issues but look pretty young, healthy and fit, and there's no way in hell I would risk fainting on a bus. Sorry, but I'm not going to risk injury to myself and others when someone healthier can offer their seat.", "Tip: don't make eye contact while in public transportation. A d if they still tap you.. ignore.\n\nI don't doubt that the woman was tired, but was there only one chair in that whole bus? And was your son sitting on this one magical seat?\n\nDon't need all the medical reasons and excuses,  you give up your seat when  you want to, not when someone comes and asks/ demand you stand up and let them sit.\n\nNtA.  Not even a little bit.", "NTA.  And this is part of a bigger issue where people feel the need to see an obvious disability before they\u2019ll accept that someone may need accommodations.  Don\u2019t worry about that woman and her mother - they were the entitled ones.", "NTA. Every other seat on the bus was also taken by someone who needed the seat more than this old woman? Really? Doubt it. \n\nThe times I most needed accommodations were while early pregnant, when I looked like a healthy young woman (and not at all pregnant) but in fact felt like puking at basically all times. Ironically when obviously hugely pregnant and people did offer their seats I felt fine and would have easily been able to stand. Not everyone who looks able bodied, young, and healthy is. Its not egregious that she tapped you and asked, but once you explained once that should have been the end of it.", "NTA\n\n\u201cMay I ask where you studied medicine? You\u2019re able to diagnose every possible illness in just a glance! I\u2019d love to send my medical team the school\u2019s information so they can start enrolling.\u201d \n\nThen stare them straight in the eyes until they back down.", "NTA you can't just look at someone and tell that they're healthy and able.", "Oh my goodness. NTA. Young people can be disabled too! What a dumb attitude. I'd be fuming", "NTA.  Unless you had him sitting in the reserved seating, there was no reason to single you and your son out, nor was there any reason to call you a bitch.  There was only one entitled party, and it wasn't you.", "NTA not all illnesses are visual. You were looking out for your son just as the woman was looking out for her mom. In this case she was in the wrong as she just assumed somebody so young couldn\u2019t be ill. She should\u2019ve taken you at your word and asked someone else for their seat. The mouthpiece that got off with you could\u2019ve given them her seat if she had one if it was that important to her. Hopefully your son gets better", "NTA and I\u2019d have told them to mind their fucking business.", "NTA omg im a disabled 23f but you wouldn't know that at all by looking at me. Im getting over some pretty wild illnesses and am now prone to fainting. I cannot believe how some people act seeing me park in handicap parking. You did right by your son and you know his needs more than a stranger on a bus. Seats are first come first serve. Good on you.", "NTA\n\nThey suck for jumping to conclusions.", "NTA Oh, he was \"young and healthy\", wow, did they checked his health records? Made a check-up in the bus? No? Just because someone is young, they are always healthy. And old people are always ill and can't stay.\n\nYes, she could ask. Once. But to go on and on and making a scene. There were so many other people. Why not ask them? Noooo, she needed to prove a point! And then insults you. \n\nI'm sorry this happened to you both. Some people are just AH.\n\nAnd the irony tgat she let her \"poor mommy\" stand longer just because she seeked a fight and not asked someone else. This make me ask if she was \"just old\" but other fine, so no danger to fall any moments or pain to stand.", "NTA. Totally fine of the daughter to ask once, anything more than that put her in AH territory. Your son needed that seat, and is sounds totally reasonable he keep it. If she was so bothered about getting her mother a seat she should\u2019ve asked someone else. \n\nAge is not always a determining factor and like many people have said, invisible disabilities exist. She has no idea about your son and is being judgemental and lacking empathy for people other than her immediate family. But also it sounds like safety wise your son needed to be seated.", "NTA I've noticed elderly people tend to think their age is an excuse for ableism (though technically this wasn't ableism, your son was just unwell, but still shitty of her to assume he was able-bodied). Not all of them but a lot can be very entitled just because they've lived longer. They're also the types to say \"well, you don't LOOK disabled\" \ud83d\ude44 she could've asked literally anyone else but I assume she expects all teenagers to be fit and healthy when it's not that simple. I also would've told that bystanding cow to mind her own business lmao", "NTA at all, sorry you went through that.", "NTA. Old lady 1 and her daughter are TA for being rude about it and seemingly not even asking another person for a seat? And old lady 2 should mind her own business. I wouldn't have responded too kindly to her.", "So sorry that you and your son were treated this way.\nNTA", "Nta, nobody is entitled to a seat that is occupied by someone else. Regardless of age mental health etc. The only exception being a reserved disabled seat for wheel chair accessibility.", "NTA \u2014 I have an invisible disability which was exacerbated by my first pregnancy. I looked young and healthy and people would routinely give me Shit for sitting down when the reality is that standing would have likely meant fainting or throwing up on someone.", "NTA.  Some people are simply incapable of considering that other people may have circumstances that are not apparent at first.  Sometimes those people are old women.  \n\nIts no biggie tbh.  Can't please everyone.  You did what you thought was best.\n\nThe bus was full.  Didn't see anyone else offer a seat so obviously it wasn't that big a deal.", "NTA.  Hidden disabilities are a thing and sick people often take the bus.", "NTA. Something similar happened to me with my wife when we were heading home after her second chemo appointment. Her hair hadn\u2019t fallen out yet but she was queasy and tired and sitting\u2014not even in the elderly seating on the bus. A man went off on her about how she was young and healthy and ought to stand for her elders. Cursing and muttering. People assume and that has nothing to do with you. Your son was sick and needed the seat. \ud83d\udc97", " NTA son being sick or not no one is entitled to your seat that you were already sitting in.", "NTA. People are quick to judge, even when they don't fully understand a situation. Don't stress about it, you're probably never going to see these women again. I feel like the lesson here is don't assume you know the whole situation when you're ready to call someone an asshole. (I say posting a judgement on AITA \ud83d\ude02 ohhh the irony...but for real, if people worked to understand instead of judge...the world would be a better place)", "NTA. \n\nYour son needed the seat and you were trying to get him feeling well enough to be able to walk off of the bus, which, it seems, you were able to do. Also, might I add that you handled this significantly better than I would have, especially hearing them making comments about you after you\u2019ve said no to them. The others on the bud had no idea what your son\u2019s condition was and clearly only cared about their own selves and well-being based on the belief that, because your son was seemingly \u201cyoung and healthy\u201d, he could withstand the trip without a seat. You know your child, though, and you did what was best for him in this scenario, which is what a parent does.\n\nOthers have said it, too, but it\u2019s extremely assumptive on the part of the mother-daughter duo who were being bullies to you and your son, as well as the random stranger who supported them once you left the bus that your son should have stood up. Others could have been asked (regardless of age or gender) but they decided to single out the young boy because he was young. Absolutely ridiculous of them, really.", "NTA not every disability is visible and those women suck", "It\u2019s a jungle out there especially on public transit. You had to protect your own. The strange women chose to attack your character. You were an easy target so the bully went after you. Women and children (young people) are the most vulnerable across the globe. Sometimes we have to go toe to toe with abusers and people in pain of all sorts. You handled it well, try not to beat yourself up.", "Just a question: If he couldn\u2019t stand and was that out of it, how did he get off the bus and walk to his appointment? I\u2019m assuming the bus didn\u2019t drive up to the office door, but to a location nearby. If he was revived by the candy bar to the point  he could walk away, he should have been able to give his seat away (after he had eaten it). I\u2019m not trying to dispute his condition, however I\u2019ve been medical for 27 years and I\u2019ve never heard of a mental health condition made better by a sugary snack. This sounds more like diabetes. Also, if he has a medical condition where he gets confused if his blood sugar is low, then he needs a medical alert bracelet/necklace. So if he fainted while he was in public alone, medical staff would know how to treat him. I\u2019m not making a decision on the a**hole status. But I really feel there is more to this.", "INFO: Did your son occupy a handicap/accessible seat? (they are usually easier to get into, get out of, have handles, a special button to let the driver know that they want to get out and will take some time etc.)\n\nI ask because I wonder if that's why the woman asked for your seat in particular and why she was pissed off because the other seats would have been harder to access for the old lady.", "NTA - Your son's case demonstrates we can all be ill on a bus and unable to give up a seat.  You understood his needs and were polite conveying it to the judgemental folks. \n\nNo offense but why is a 17 year old not eating or meeting this goal?  This stood out since it was a critical factor of feeling ill. Him grabbing a powerbar before leaving could have helped.  No need to comment on this just want to point out contributing factors.", "NTA, but make sure your son eats. He\u2019s still a kid and it\u2019s your job to help him when he doesn\u2019t eat. If he gets to the point where he\u2019s fainting from lack of food then it\u2019s on you to feed him proper meals.", "NTA. \n\nThe way everyone assumes if you\u2019re young, you\u2019re healthy is sad. I\u2019m sorry you and your son were subjected to this discrimination.", "NTA - people are shitty to me for not giving up seats before like this and it\u2019s like okay well you\u2019re clearly okay enough to be pissing and moaning and I am literally afraid I\u2019ll faint if I stand but whatever", "NTA. As a disabled person, this story is all to common for me. We all assume illness and disability looks a certain way. A lot of people with invisible disabilities get treated like this as well and it isn't ok. They are showing a bias here. Thing is simple: Health or lack there of doesn't have a look. They could have asked anyone else.", "So he has no physical disability (OP said it was mental health related), but couldn\u2019t stand because he hadn\u2019t eaten?", "NTA, why did they need to focus on just your son? Was it an entire bus full of elderly and pregnant women?? There wasn\u2019t one other person who could have moved?", "NTA if he was feeling faint and nauseous then he needed to be sat down\nAlso. Did anyone else on this very busy bus offer their seat?", "NTA: but, I would have given a \u2018he is having a low sugar episode\u2019 or something to get them to back off.

It\u2019s your right to sit if you feel you need it. \n\nYes, if you\u2019re healthy and willing you can give up your seat, but if you don\u2019t do it nobody should make you feel ashamed about it.

Any other person calling you names could have offered their seat.", "NTA. I\u2019m really sorry you experienced such unpleasant behaviour. People just don\u2019t understand about hidden impairments. I know you can get sunflower lanyards but not sure a teenager would fancy that!", "NTA. They don\u2019t know anything about your son or why he would need to sit.

Illnesses can be invisible and while it\u2019s common courtesy to give up your seats for the elderly, sick or disabled people also get priority. Having an \u2018invisible illness\u2019 sucks and I get dirty looks from older people all the time for needing to sit in the priority seating, but no one is owed an explanation or a justification for an illness. My grandparents are in their 80\u2019s and way fitter and more active than most people I know my age, so being elderly doesn\u2019t trump someone being ill.

Coerced etiquette misses the whole point of etiquette.", "NTA\n\nThere are lots of people with invisible illnesses out there, and you absolutely approached this the right way. The only entitled person here was the daughter of the elderly woman. Plus, the chance of the bus being 100% elderly folks aside from your kiddo is very slim, so they could have easily asked someone else. Good on you for respecting your kid and being polite in this situation.\n\nI deal with very debilitating chronic pain, I get exhausted very easily, and I am the full time caretaker for my disabled partner (so I need to save my energy to help them out). If I am not sitting on the bus and saving my energy, it's very likely I will get exhausted and have a seizure later on that will effect me for days.

Unfortunately, my husband let our daughter borrow his car and then had an emergency at work so he had to use my car so my son and I had to take the bus. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t ideal, but I\u2019d rather the bus than miss an appointment. \n\nWhile it isn\u2019t my place to share why he goes to therapy, I will say that he will often forget to eat. I usually make sure he\u2019s fed, but due to the mess in the morning, it slipped my mind. \n\nThe bus wasn\u2019t too crowded but all the seats were taken. My son wasn\u2019t doing too well and I could tell he was feeling dizzy from hunger+the bus. So the second someone got off their seat, I sat him down. I then tried to find a chocolate bar I had in my bag. \n\nWhile this is happening, I noticed an elderly woman and her adult daughter standing beside us. I didn\u2019t pay much attention until the daughter tapped me on the shoulder. \n\nShe asked if my son could move so that her elderly mother could have a seat. I felt really bad, I really did, but my son was not doing great and standing would make it harder. I had found the chocolate and he was eating it slowly but if he stood up right then, I can assure you he would\u2019ve fainted. \n\nI apologized to her and explained that my son wasn\u2019t feeling well. \n\nShe rolled her eyes at me and said that she saw him standing earlier and that he\u2019s a young healthy teenage boy-he\u2019ll be fine. I apologized once again and told her that he wasn\u2019t feeling well and that if he was then HE himself would\u2019ve offered her a seat. \n\nThe daughter told me to look at her mother and I admit, the poor woman looked really tired. But I couldn\u2019t. My son had started to lean against me so I told the woman one last time that I was sorry and to ask someone else.\n\nI then heard them both whispering and calling me an entitled bitch. And when we got off the bus, a woman that got off with us said that a teenage boy can handle standing more than an elderly woman can and that she hopes someone treats me like that when I\u2019m her age. My son was so out of it, I don\u2019t think he even noticed or cared but I can\u2019t get this off my mind. AITA? A totally unrelated woman thought I was along with the two.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Now, the woman with the elderly mother assuming you were lying and not understanding that even young people have physical difficulties sometimes. She seems like the entitled one.

It is fine to ask, but if the response is that the person sitting needs that seat for their own medical concern (and being about to possibly faint DEFINITELY qualifies!), they need to back off and ask the next person, not argue with you about how they think your son is healthy and fine to stand after seeing him for two minutes on a bus, just because of his age. Teenagers can have cancer, diabetes, POTS, fatigue---any number of things that wouldn't necessarily be visible but would mean they need to sit on the bus. \n\nAlso the woman who took it on herself to criticize you afterward could have given up her seat.", "NTA.

By age 65, if she would\u2019ve collapsed it would\u2019ve been hard for her to break her fall since their reflexes are slower, it\u2019s common to see broken hips, femurs, and concussions in this age group. Elderly people also do not heal as well and are at a greater risk of post-operative delirium and even death after those kinds of falls. You may think I\u2019m exaggerating, but there is lots of evidence that confirms this and it\u2019s the reason elderly people must live more careful lives and avoid pushing their bodies too hard.

But, you knew the situation was bad for your son and that your son needed to sit down, and they are not required to know that. So NTA.\n\nTo be very clear: it's not some kind of a \"bus culture\" or anything like that, it's more just about how people who ride the bus talk to each other. Some are nicer than others; but in my experience, most of them are one of two ways: quiet, or blunt and conversational.

Anyway, if they pressed the issue after that they would have either looked like the AHs (although probably no one would care) or you would have realized what a sexist area you live in. A lot of people who ride the bus have issues, physical and/or mental, and a lot of them understand you can't afford another way to get to medical help. It's nothing new. Most regular bus riders will only speak up in defense of people they know really well, so there's usually no support either way, and if the situation goes on for too long the bus driver will have the final say because he's on a time limit and has to get going.\n\nP.

Wow.", "I'm referring to priority seating dude!", "Wow, I hope you ever have a debilitating illness that causes you to miss meals or a mental health issue that makes you unable to deal with self care. \nYour lack of empathy is astounding! Sure this was a young person who would seem able to stand but after being told he wasn\u2019t well the other person should have turned her attention to asking others for their seat. It doesn\u2019t matter why you are unwell and need a seat, if you are unwell then you are unwell. They got to the seat first and he needed it.", "The point is people are going to be uncomfortable disclosing medical info about their kids on the Internet to strangers so it's best not to ask. Their son is sick and needed a seat, that should be the end of story.", "And we're allowed to tell you that you're a dick.", "It kinda feels like you're trying to corner OP into being an AH for something that's not really related to the post.\n\nReading between the lines, it sounds like the son has an eating disorder. He could be totally capable of looking after himself almost all the time, but struggle with maintaining a healthy diet. None of that matter though to this specific situation.", "Obviously she wasn't already sitting. Why would she sit while making her ill son stand until a seat was available?", "Yes it is and yes you did.  I am talking about the incorrect blanket claim you made about transit policy with regard to riders giving up their seats for people who are disabled.  Try to keep up.\n\n**Edit:** Replying here since you replied with a childish response and immediately blocked me - this is the blanket claim you made to which I responded with objective fact and zero opinion:\n\n*\"*[*you don't give up your seat IF you WANT to, you're supposed to. It's not a choice, it's policy on transit.*](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10upxdd/comment/j7dcsbg/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)*\"*\n\nAs I and others have pointed out, this is not the case everywhere - which makes it an incorrect claim.  Get a clue indeed..", "Read your first comment again: You are making a blanket claim acting like your city\u2019s rules apply to every other place in the world. You\u2019re clearly the one ignorant to transit rules because you\u2019re acting like there\u2019s one set of rules for everyone. Different places have different rules and laws, why is that so difficult to understand for you?", "yeah, *now.*", "I did t make a blanket claim about anything. Get a clue."]}
