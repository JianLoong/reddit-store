We were sad but got over it, it was her day and if she didn't want anyone there then that was that. We talk on the phone or met up at least ever week so it was a huge suprise.\n\nThen they moved down two states, its would be a trip to visit so we still talk on the phone more instead of visits. So for holidays we would visit or they would visit. This year at Thanksgiving she brought a surprise, her son Dave (1 month). I didn't even know she was pregnant, we talked all the time and nothing. Again was sad we missed such a large milestone in her life but didn't say anything. We were happy to met the grandbaby.\n\nI called today to ask about what they wanted me to bring out for the baby for the Christmas visit, the old baby bed and whatnot. Sara told me that they will not be coming up for Christmas, I asked if we were going down this year? She said no that just nuclear family for Dave's first christmas. I asked if we could facetime christmas morning or that day to see Dave and there tree and she said no. After that conversation I talked to my husband\n\nWe are both sad again and tired of missing milestones in Sara's life, I sent Sara a text that me and her dad are going to take a step back. (Low contact). She called and asked what this was about, I told her and it broke into an argument. That it is her life and she can do what she wants with her kid and so on.

Kids don't tend to distance themselves like this unless their upbringing was traumatic in some way. So how strict were you when you raised your daughter? Were you judgmental? Were you unaccepting?", "There have to be some missing pieces here. There's no way your relationship with her pre-elopement was as healthy as you're stating if she's putting this much effort into distancing herself from you. And the fact that your gut reaction to disagreeing with her choice was to go low contact instead of talking to her about why she's distancing herself is a HUGE red flag. Something's not right here.\n\nEDIT: Updating this post to provide a judgment since OP (unsurprisingly) refuses to address this comment: YTA.", "Usually when adult children are hiding big parts of their lives, it's because the person they are hiding it from stomps boundaries.  Take a really good look at how you've behaved over her lifetime, did you ignore her boundaries?  If not, then it could be her relationship.  He could be isolating her and convincing her that she needs to stay away.", "I feel like something is missing. Children usually don\u2019t cut parents out of their lives unless boundaries were stepped on. There\u2018 s either information about y\u2019all\u2019s relationship that\u2019s missing or maybe she has a controlling husband? You don\u2019t just forget to tell your parents you\u2019re pregnant.", "With the information we have, NTA. It sounds like she keeps keeping big milestone moments out of knowledge from you guys, and I think it\u2019s pretty reasonable to be upset about not knowing your daughter had a baby. Sure, your daughter is allowed to make the choices like moving away, not telling you she got eloped, not telling you about her baby, etc. But she needs to understand that all of our choices will have consequences, whether they be good or bad. You\u2019re completely within your rights to start talking less with your daughter, and if what you are telling us is true and that she had no reason to keep quiet continuously, then yeah I don\u2019t blame you for being upset. She doesn\u2019t get to call you an ass just because you made a choice after she made hers, she decided to no longer tell you about important life moments, you decided that you wanted to go low contact due to this. You are not in the wrong here.", "I would like to hear your daughter's side of the story. There seems to be a lot of missing parts. \n\nAlso wanting  to have baby's first christmas with just the nuclear family is reasonable. Face timing all the relatives can be a distraction and ruin the christmas mood. It just depends on the family dynamic.", "Based on this post NTA, and honestly it's a fair response to go LC when someone doesn't seem to want you in their life.  Now admittedly lots of people are obviously jumping on the \"there must be a reason\" and they're right people don't do things for No Reason.  However they all seem to automatically assume the reason is on you, there are lots of other possibilities as everyone is influenced by everything around them.  \n\nSure maybe there is something in your past that led to this, maybe her spouse doesn't like the visits, maybe her schedule as a nurse means she's having an impossible time balancing everything, the list goes On and On.  \n\nThe fact will remain though regardless of the reason that she hasn't made keeping you in the loop about very important events in her life a priority.  Until she is willing to give a reason for that or change the behavior it is perfectly reasonable for you to prioritize your mental health same as everyone else.", "NTA.

He talks about what's on his mind and there aren't many openings to talk about my life. \n\nHe's like this with everyone.

I dunno. It's not what he wants to talk about.", "NTA. Your daughter doesn't let you know about things that are important life events even though you talk all the time. Her reason for eloping makes sense, but not telling you she was pregnant and claiming she thought she did doesn't make sense at all. And her reaction to you telling her you're going to back off of contacting her as much makes no sense either since she doesn't tell you what's really going on (pregnancy) and won't even FaceTime you Christmas morning. It's normal you would be hurt and confused by it all and would not contact her as much when it appears that's what she wants. Unless her husband is controlling and/or abusive, but without some hint from her, you have no way of knowing that and assuming it could damage what relationship you have left.", "I'm genuinely sorry for your situation. I use to work closely with an older gentlemen who's daughter did something similar. He said they were always a close family. When he talks about her you can tell how proud he is. She went to college, got a decent job doing something with computers. She moved a state away for the job and got more and more private.

Maybe you should ask if that is the case? It sounds like she might be hiding something.", " It sounds like your hurt because it feels like you\u2019re being left out of your daughters life, my bit of advice is that in the future you should ask what their plans are and then follow it up by asking if they would like you to join them without any assumptions or pressure.", "Something us missing, problem is I'm not sure what. There's a reason she's going lc, but I can't see why. There is the reddit jump to abuse, but no evidence so too big of a leap. I don't think judgement can be made. Best I can say is keep trying, don't give up on them yet.", "Based on what\u2019s presented NTA.

I can imagine being more comfortable conducting relationships at a physical distance, and if the daughter didn\u2019t want the pressure of actual and more frequent visits I could see not telling the family if she feels like her boundaries would be railroaded by grandparent excitement.\n\nIf the relationship between mom and daughter is as solid as it is portrayed, is it possible that she wasn\u2019t pregnant and got the baby some other way?

I maintained contact with my abusive mother too, until I couldn't tolerate it anymore. The daughter may be struggling with setting boundaries and given the parents' reaction, I wouldn't blame her. If she's really acting out of character, I'd be worried that she's being abused and controlled or that maybe she was having a mental health struggle. Why would you choose to go low contact if this is truly odd and out-of-character behavior for the daughter? I have a feeling that there's a bit missing here. My own abusive mother acted surprised and hurt when I cut contact. She told everyone my husband made me do it or that I was selfish and entitled because she spoiled me too much (lol). I really wish we had the daughter's take on the situation.

Instead of doing self reflection and asking yourself why that might be you make it about yourself and decide, I\u2019m gonna go even lower contact cause you aren\u2019t getting the contact with her you want. YTA! For getting angry at her boundaries she put into place for an obvious reason. If she didn\u2019t want you in her or her child\u2019s life she wouldn\u2019t have introduced you but you probably didn\u2019t see it that way you just saw the time you weren\u2019t getting and we\u2019re hurt about it which is the main reason I voted for AH btw.

Her son and his wife have 2 little ones and they have all become this very tight family unit that doesn't allow anyone else in. It's hurtful but what can I do? I would not be at all surprised if the same thing has happened here. The daughter is excluding her parents b/c she's hyper invested in her new life. Probably obsessively so. It's not fair.

He probably has a way of telling her to be private without making it sound weird. There\u2019s more to it, but I think on the husbands side, not yours.", "Agreed. In this case though the amount on info missing is saying more. Nobody goes NC/LC unless there is a reason. And she just reminded me of some people I know who act exactly like this and then they cry their kids forget about them.", "Omg, as a daughter like OPs, this is exactly what happened in the conversation with my own mother. \n\nThe year I told my mom we're staying home for Christmas, she took all of our gifts back and held on to that grudge for years.", ">For being pregnant, she said she forgot to mention it\n\nNo way that's a real answer. Nobody forgets to mention they're pregnant, not for 9 months (and then another month since you didn't know about the kid until he was a month old). She purposely didn't tell you. Either you're intentionally leaving out information, or you're completely oblivious.", "I'm worried for your daughter that this is a subtle but increasing level of abuse in the form of alienation being inflicted on your daughter by her husband. It is sounding like if he doesn't have it, she can't have it (a family, people involved in your big events, etc.).\n\nIf you can't think of any times that she saw you as being overbearing, over-involved, or otherwise involving yourself in her life in an overreaching way and you guys went through drama, then all this pull-back seems to be coming from the husband. And my concern is that it is not based on sensitivity by your daughter to her husband, but rather more demand from the husband, and she goes along with it because love. She may not even realize what is happening, like the frog in the boiling pot.\n\nEither way, I think you need to have a real conversation with her instead of just pulling back.", "Forgot to mention every week that she was pregnant and also had a baby? That's sketchy.", "Erm, yes. That's why I couched with \"probably something like\" and not \"while i was listening to the line tap I have on ops phone\"", "We don't know what wording mom used. It may have been inflammatory.", "I am 100% behind this theory. I\u2019m not sure how nobody else is seeing it or mentioning it. It has to be the husband alienating her from her family. Maybe it\u2019s subtle and he makes it sound like it makes sense. But I think she\u2019s being emotionally abused.", "Yeah, that's up there with the guy asking if he was TA because he did a lame proposal in a hotel room... he *forgot* while out at dinner. WHAT?", "If OPs daughter has moved 2 states away but is still keeping up regular contact willingly, I think it puts the husband more in the picture as the one pulling the strings\u2026", "Ooooohh, do you have the link to that? I'd love to read it!", "But considering her daughter mentioned nothing about a pregnancy - that itself is weird and normally done with individuals avoiding manipulation/ love bombings or baby rabies."]}
