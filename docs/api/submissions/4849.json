We were happy to met the grandbaby.\n\nI called today to ask about what they wanted me to bring out for the baby for the Christmas visit, the old baby bed and whatnot.

Kids don't tend to distance themselves like this unless their upbringing was traumatic in some way. So how strict were you when you raised your daughter? Were you judgmental? Were you unaccepting?", "There have to be some missing pieces here. There's no way your relationship with her pre-elopement was as healthy as you're stating if she's putting this much effort into distancing herself from you. And the fact that your gut reaction to disagreeing with her choice was to go low contact instead of talking to her about why she's distancing herself is a HUGE red flag. Something's not right here.", "Usually when adult children are hiding big parts of their lives, it's because the person they are hiding it from stomps boundaries.  Take a really good look at how you've behaved over her lifetime, did you ignore her boundaries?  If not, then it could be her relationship.  He could be isolating her and convincing her that she needs to stay away.", "I feel like something is missing. Children usually don\u2019t cut parents out of their lives unless boundaries were stepped on. There\u2018 s either information about y\u2019all\u2019s relationship that\u2019s missing or maybe she has a controlling husband? You don\u2019t just forget to tell your parents you\u2019re pregnant.", "With the information we have, NTA. It sounds like she keeps keeping big milestone moments out of knowledge from you guys, and I think it\u2019s pretty reasonable to be upset about not knowing your daughter had a baby. Sure, your daughter is allowed to make the choices like moving away, not telling you she got eloped, not telling you about her baby, etc. But she needs to understand that all of our choices will have consequences, whether they be good or bad. You\u2019re completely within your rights to start talking less with your daughter, and if what you are telling us is true and that she had no reason to keep quiet continuously, then yeah I don\u2019t blame you for being upset. She doesn\u2019t get to call you an ass just because you made a choice after she made hers, she decided to no longer tell you about important life moments, you decided that you wanted to go low contact due to this. You are not in the wrong here.", "I would like to hear your daughter's side of the story. There seems to be a lot of missing parts. \n\nAlso wanting  to have baby's first christmas with just the nuclear family is reasonable. Face timing all the relatives can be a distraction and ruin the christmas mood. It just depends on the family dynamic.", "Based on this post NTA, and honestly it's a fair response to go LC when someone doesn't seem to want you in their life.  Now admittedly lots of people are obviously jumping on the \"there must be a reason\" and they're right people don't do things for No Reason.  However they all seem to automatically assume the reason is on you, there are lots of other possibilities as everyone is influenced by everything around them.  \n\nSure maybe there is something in your past that led to this, maybe her spouse doesn't like the visits, maybe her schedule as a nurse means she's having an impossible time balancing everything, the list goes On and On.  \n\nThe fact will remain though regardless of the reason that she hasn't made keeping you in the loop about very important events in her life a priority.  Until she is willing to give a reason for that or change the behavior it is perfectly reasonable for you to prioritize your mental health same as everyone else.", "NTA.

He talks about what's on his mind and there aren't many openings to talk about my life. \n\nHe's like this with everyone. My sister told me she was trying to tell my dad about a promotion she had just gotten at work and he changed the subject to something he saw on television.\n\nHe asks the same question OP does of why he doesn't know what's going on in my life. I dunno. It's not what he wants to talk about.", "NTA. Your daughter doesn't let you know about things that are important life events even though you talk all the time. Her reason for eloping makes sense, but not telling you she was pregnant and claiming she thought she did doesn't make sense at all. And her reaction to you telling her you're going to back off of contacting her as much makes no sense either since she doesn't tell you what's really going on (pregnancy) and won't even FaceTime you Christmas morning. It's normal you would be hurt and confused by it all and would not contact her as much when it appears that's what she wants. Unless her husband is controlling and/or abusive, but without some hint from her, you have no way of knowing that and assuming it could damage what relationship you have left.", "I'm genuinely sorry for your situation. I use to work closely with an older gentlemen who's daughter did something similar. He said they were always a close family. When he talks about her you can tell how proud he is. She went to college, got a decent job doing something with computers. She moved a state away for the job and got more and more private. Apparently they text, send pics, and talk on the phone a good bit but they haven't seen her in person in two years.", "INFO: why are you all so low contact to begin with? Seems like there\u2019s a lot more to this.", "I'm gonna say NTA because if it was a case of there being an issue or issues between you two, her reaction should not have been to call you an a-hole but to agree that it's best. It could be a case of her husband alienating her from you guys or it could be that she just doesn't see the point in keeping her parents in the loop. \n\n\n(I can say that if my MIL would tell me and my bf she was going LC, we would be just fine with it.

Do you and your husband have a good relationship with him?", "NTA\n\nThis whole post had me guessing that the daughter may have some seriously big issues with you and is distancing herself for her own health; but I have no reason to assume that from what is presented. Maybe you should ask if that is the case? It sounds like she might be hiding something.", " It sounds like your hurt because it feels like you\u2019re being left out of your daughters life, my bit of advice is that in the future you should ask what their plans are and then follow it up by asking if they would like you to join them without any assumptions or pressure.", "Something us missing, problem is I'm not sure what. There's a reason she's going lc, but I can't see why. There is the reddit jump to abuse, but no evidence so too big of a leap. I don't think judgement can be made. Best I can say is keep trying, don't give up on them yet.", "Based on what\u2019s presented NTA.

IMHO, people who object to boundaries are the very ones who make them necessary. You sound like that.", "From this information, I am going to say NAH. I can imagine being more comfortable conducting relationships at a physical distance, and if the daughter didn\u2019t want the pressure of actual and more frequent visits I could see not telling the family if she feels like her boundaries would be railroaded by grandparent excitement.\n\nIf the relationship between mom and daughter is as solid as it is portrayed, is it possible that she wasn\u2019t pregnant and got the baby some other way?

It doesn't seem like she is *just* someone that likes her space, we are missing something.", "But then why did the daughter get upset about OP going LC? I think it has to do more with the duaghter's husband then with OP. I've read where this guy was getting frustrated that his wife never want his family included because she came from a toxic family and couldn't see why he was so close to his.\n\nEven my own bf had to get used to my family being close since his mom was never there.", "Oh I agree I was just trying to see if there was a way to bridge the gap maybe in time things will get better", "She didn't want to spend money on a big wedding and instead use it for the honeymoon. Also husband was in foster care and he doesn't have family to invite.\n\nFor being pregnant, she said she forgot to mention it", "yoo this is spot on!", "Very interesting read. Thanks, for posting it.", "To me, with what\u2019s presented here, it really just feels like Sara doesn\u2019t want OP\u2019s presence in her life very much. I mean, one does not simply \u201cforget\u201d to tell their mother that they\u2019re pregnant. That\u2019s just\u2026 unheard of.\n\n*But* if OP answers someone\u2019s question on what her opinion is on Sara\u2019s relationship with her husband, there may be some isolation tactics going on.", "She didn't tell me...\n\nI was talking to her the whole time she was pregnant, I was not informed over a call or text. I don't see her in person, over the summer and fall, no real holidays. Halloween isn't a big deal for us. Saw her for Easter but she was not showing at all.", "Maybe the daughter feels that they're punishing her for making her own life choices. We don't know what the family dynamic was growing up. I maintained contact with my abusive mother too, until I couldn't tolerate it anymore. The daughter may be struggling with setting boundaries and given the parents' reaction, I wouldn't blame her. If she's really acting out of character, I'd be worried that she's being abused and controlled or that maybe she was having a mental health struggle. Why would you choose to go low contact if this is truly odd and out-of-character behavior for the daughter? I have a feeling that there's a bit missing here. My own abusive mother acted surprised and hurt when I cut contact. She told everyone my husband made me do it or that I was selfish and entitled because she spoiled me too much (lol). I really wish we had the daughter's take on the situation. I have a feeling she's told them why they're at arm's length but they don't want to accept it and would rather make it all her fault.", "There is just no way you 'forget to mention' to your parents that you're pregnant.", "Ok, eloping makes sense. The not mentioning being pregnant does not. That's usually news you want to share.\n\n\nAnd seeing that you two regularly talk/facetime, asking to do that Christmas morning doesn't seem like a big ask. Not wanting to travel with a newborn is reasonable, and surprising they did for Thanksgiving. \n\n\nThis all just seems very odd, considering there is regular communication, but important events are left out entirely.", "This is the 3rd time I\u2019ve heard of people eloping or getting married at city hall because one side was NC with family and didn\u2019t want a big event that made it obvious how they didn\u2019t have much family or friends. But it still seems weird to not tell her parents, at least.", "What's your read on her husband and their relationship?", "Yes, and the fact that the husband was on foster care im getting the feeling that because he didnt have family to celebrate with the \"fair thing\" would be she doesnt celebrate with her family either", "I believe you. But please don\u2019t give up on her. It could all be ideas from the husband. Since he doesn\u2019t have relatives to bring to their marriage, she doesn\u2019t get to do it either. Or he wants their child to depend on parents only, nobody else. I don\u2019t want to dwell on his side, I\u2019m just saying his opinion on family might be warped. Please continue talking to your daughter.", "I've heard some crazy shit..  but this is a first for me. 3 pregnancies and I never 'forgot' to mention I was pregnant... for 9 months... to my mother of all people. Or just whatever close family I speak to on a weekly basis.", "We don\u2019t objectively know it\u2019s normal conversation. Maybe to OP it appears that way but something was already sus when daughter went no contact, and it\u2019s too odd to me that a woman wouldn\u2019t tell her parents she\u2019s pregnant unless something was definitely wrong. My guess is OP is blind to the full picture", "He is a pretty nice guy overall, he is an enginner works for a company. There haven't been any big red flags from him. \n\nHe's more private but I always though it was due to growing up in foster care", "I don't bother telling people I'm pregnant anymore unlrss it seems relevant because I can't really be bothered but I told them the first two times."]}
