This was affordable but barely and I had to cut a back on a lot of things. \n\nNow my gf is complaining about her job again saying its causing her to feel low and saying she's thinking of just leaving because she hates it there. I tried talking to her about waiting until something else comes along before leaving since having no money will only add to her stress. She asked if I would be able to cover everything if she left and I said I couldn't. I pointed out if I did pay for everything that would mean that pretty much every month I'd end up dipping into my savings and that After rent and bills and food, I'd have pretty much nothing at all left.\n\nShe just said it's something I might have ot do soon and I again said I won't be. I said as shit as it may be she'll eithre have to stay at her current job or pay her half of the rent and bills from her savings. She accused me of not being supporting and started talking about how I knew she hated it at her job and should want to help her. I said I do help her but that is too much to ask since she knows I can't afford it and I should not have to dip into my savings just because she quits a job. \n\nShe again just accused me of being unsupportive.

But asking you to carry her financially for an indeterminate period is not cool.", "NTA. Not sure where you are, but if she\u2019s depressed, she can see about applying for medical leave from her job. This way she can take the time to get better and also have some income. Does she have a therapist, psychologist, or psychiatrist? They would need to provide documentation to her employer supporting her need for her medical leave. It feels like a lot of hoops, especially while depressed, but it will take some of the financial strain off of both of you while she heals.", "NTA. Especially if she has savings!

She can find another job before she quits her current one.\n\nNTA.", "NTA and she won\u2019t get unemployment if she quits. Better that she sucks it up and gets fired than to quit and leave you with the total burden. As many people mentioned, in this economy, she needs a job or at least a steady income. However she makes it happen is up to her but you can\u2019t be burdened because of her mental health. If she\u2019s not already in therapy, a lot of companies offer discounts if she looks into it.", "Nta. It isn't fair to place all the pressure on you when it can be avoided. Can she drop her hours a little? If you can budget for that maybe she can pick up an online course and switch careers. That way she keeps working but also has a way out of her job that won't bankrupt you.", "NTA - she's the one not being supportive by not being proactive.  If she doesn't like it at her job then she needs to find a new one as well as being able to balance out the finances.  I feel like she is taking advantage of you because she just doesn't want to work.  How would she be approaching her scenario if she didn't have you to SUPPORT her.  She wants to be taken care of which if a far cry from \"being supportive\".  You have been very supportive.", "NTA. \n\nIt's one thing to leave work involuntarily, or for serious health problems. It's quite another to give up a job because you don't like it, and expect other people to carry your ass. \n\nHonestly I think that if you allow her to freeload, you'll never stop. She'll let you work yourself to death rather than getting a job herself. Just my opinion based on a lifetime of knowing some people who ALWAYS seem to have a reason to quit their jobs.", "NTA this is emotional manipulation from someone who really just wants to stop making an effort and coast through life. It\u2019s not going to stop there either. They\u2019ll just become a burden who won\u2019t even be present for you as a partner. Don\u2019t let this happen.", "NTA. Don\u2019t be surprised if shes trying to set this up so she doesn\u2019t have to work at all. And why is it ok for you to tap into emergency saving but she can\u2019t tap into hers. Double standard much. I\u2019d be frank with her. You can quit. But refusing to pay ur part of shared expenses is a deal breaker for me. Be prepared to follow thru tho which may mean moving or evicting. Depending on ur current situation.", "NTA. Girlfriend is selfish and manipulative though. Doesn\u2019t seem like much of a team.", "NTA. What is it about today's young adults that they think that a depressing job is a good excuse to just quit and let someone else pick up the bills indefinitely?\n\nMost able bodied adults need to work to support themselves, period. Don't like your job? Grin and bear it and apply for something else. Yes, do it while you are still employed. Boomers did this for decades; milennials can too. \n\nI cannot even begin to count the many times I got frustrated/depressed with my work. I endured discrimination and sexual harassment before they became household words. You just suck it up and take responsibility for your life.", "NTA. You've been to this party before, and at 75% it didn't sound fun. Supportive does not mean being a doormat and sucking up 100% because she doesn't like her job and doesn't want to find a new one before quitting. She can pay from her savings and/or land a new job, asking you to use your savings rather than hers is selfish.", "NTA. How old is she? I assume she's a grown ass adult. And as grown ass adults we realize that we are responsible for things that we own/use. My husband and I both contribute to the household bills and he could technically cover everything should I decide to be extremely irresponsible and quit my job just because its not fun anymore. But as a grown ass adult, I fully realize that doing so would be a detriment to the family finances. \n\nFor her to expect that you will use all of your savings to cover her portion of the bills because she doesn't like her job is irresponsible and childish. If she wants to quit her job, she uses her savings to make up the difference until her magical unicorn dream job appears. Which let's be honest, she sounds like she'd like to be a stay at home girlfriend. Please don't upgrade her to stay at home wife!", "NTA - if she has savings to dip into, she needs to do that first if she quits her job without having another lined up. If she doesn't want to do that, tough shit. It's not your responsibility to cover for her, you might as well be single.", "NTA\n\nyou don't have a partner, you have a dependent.  You have been supporting them above and beyond for 2 years and they want more and are threatening to just quit - that is insane!!!\n\nI make a lot more than my partner and this was based on a career convo a few years ago where she wanted to do less. The trade off, because this is a team, was that she'd take on proportionally more around the house if I had to shoulder more financial load.\n\nyour lazy deadbeat gf just sees you as an ATM.

How does that work.", "NTA. We all have jobs we don\u2019t like and don\u2019t wanna do. You were graceful enough once to handle most of the finances before.

You've lived together for twelve (12) months and she has worked and paid her half of the bills for only 3 of them.

But you do it until you have something else lined up so you don't ruin your life and the lives of your loved ones.", "NTA", "NTA. She is an adult, and she better start acting like one. It's one thing to be unexpectedly laid off or something similar, but she's actively choosing to quit without any backup plan or another job lined up.

She knows how much she hates her job, she should start looking, before she quits her job.", "NTA. I have never liked working. It sucks. I've had maybe 2 jobs I \"enjoyed\" and even that term doesn't feel like the right description. I have depression and a handful of cool acronyms of mental illnesses. But I still work. I hate my current job. I'm doing the work of 3 people. My bosses only got the job because daddy owns the company. But... until I have another job lined up, as an adult, I must suck it up. I'm not asking my boyfriend to pay all the bills. \n\nYour girlfriend needs to grow up and start working on her mental health. It's not going to magically fix itself. She's the only person in the entire world who can make a change. If her depression is so bad it prevents her from working or living, it's time to get inpatient treatment until she's stable enough to live in the real world.", "NTA we all hate our jobs and we're all depressed. Doesn't give her a reason to make you pay all the bills", "You have been supporting her. It is time for her to be a big girl and look for a new job instead of complaining about the one she has. NTA, but do not keep allowing her to use you for your money like this. She doesn\u2019t sound like she would support you back if you needed it.", "NTA. Why should you have to carry the financial burden of her choice to leave her job. Being willing to do it once when her mental health was poor was extremely supportive. Now it sounds like she wants to take advantage of you. You gave her sound advice to start looking for another job so she can quit the one she hates. This is what most adults have to do. If she quits without having another job lined up, she\u2019s liable to just become a leach. Maybe you can offer to help her update her cover letter and resume or start looking for other jobs, but she\u2019s being manipulative in claiming you\u2019re not being supportive.", "NTA. If she is feeling depressed she needs to find another job or go to therapy. Leaving her job without the ability to pay for her part of the bills is not an option unless she has at least 3-4 months of bill payments saved up that she can pull out of her savings to pay her half", "NTA.  You have lived together for 12 months. She has had 3 months of reduced bills and now is asking again.  This would be a red flag and even a dealbreaker for me.   This is not how adulthood works.", "Totally NTA. \n\nI get why OP\u2019s partner feels desperate. I left a job last year that was really damaging to my mental health, and I completely understand the feeling of losing a little bit of yourself every time you have to go back to that office. It\u2019s awful, and I wouldn\u2019t wish it on anybody. But I kept going back until I had another job in place, because I can\u2019t afford to not have an income. It\u2019s a truly terrible reality to have to live in, but it\u2019s the one we\u2019ve got, and OP\u2019s partner needs to be realistic about it and either keep the job until she gets a new one, or make sure her savings are enough to cover her expenses in the meantime.", "Except I doubt GF has any intention of finding a new job. \n\nIf OP agrees to do this \u201ctemporarily\u201d it will gradually become permanent.\n\nFirst she\u2019ll claim she\u2019s applying but not getting any interviews.\n\nNext, she\u2019ll say they can survive on his salary and isn\u2019t it great to have a SAHGF. \n\nThen she\u2019ll start talking about starting a family and how she can\u2019t wait to be a SAHM.\n\nOP needs to see the bright red flags and rethink his future with GF.", "agreed. But also maybe, since you've only put 2 years in.. should you maybe consider whether this is someone you want to build a life with? If she is comfortable making this kind of demand and putting this kind of strain on you (seemingly for no reason, as well, as you mention that she has savings) what else is she willing to ask of you? And will she always describe you not wanting to agree to an unreasonable situation as being an asshole?\n\nalso, what's with this general feeling in the post that they both seem to think savings isn't money? Like, yeah, it's good to have savings for security and everything, but it's also 100% money. OP makes it sound like they would become homeless and tell people they're broke because a chequing account might be empty but touching their savings isn't an option.", "THIS!!!", "NTA.

Yeah she has money saved up\n\nAgreeing for a set time doesn't help because that'll mean she leaves her job but after the stated period of time if she doesn't have a job we're still in the same position", "How is it self centred to not want to spend money I don't have?\n\nLike I said in the post I'd have to be dipping into my savings if I paid the complete cost. Do you think I should use my savings to pay my gfs rent before she uses her own?", "NTA, his girlfriend is being entitled. I absolutely sympathize with people struggling with mental health and working shitty jobs that make it worse but she has savings that she can dip into if she quits her job without another lined up. \n\nShe's not TA for wanting to improve her mental health but she absolutely is TA for telling him that he'll have to cover for her in that case. Maybe compromise is afoot with her offering to pay a certain percentage from savings and paying him back after for what he does cover, but I don't blame OP for being frustrated with her insisting that he has to cover all of the bills if she quits with no plan.", "Yeah, they are suppose to be a team and OP\u2019s partner isn\u2019t acting like it. OP can support her emotionally but requesting them to foot the entire financial bill is very self centered.\n\nNTA OP", "Yes. Making your partner suffer because your decisions is not supporting them, it's enabling their irresponsible behaviors and making them think that every time a job or whatever else doesn't work out, they don't have to lift their weight that they caused and that isn't fair to OP. I too have stayed in horrible toxic and fucking literally abusive work places til I had smthing worth leaving to. It took almost a year to find something with better PAy that hired me and was worh it. I never would have been okay making my partner at that time pay for everything. He couldn't have.

Support isn't letting someone sink even deeper into their depression (which is what would happen if she quit her job, stayed home, isolated herself, and felt even worse about herself). Support is helping her find a therapist, helping her with her job search, or whatever else you can do to help her keep herself afloat. Exercise, hobbies, friends. \n\nDon't give in, OP.", "If she has savings then she should use that first. People are capable of doing amazing things when they are out of options. She sees your money as the first option instead of the last option. I don\u2019t like my job either but I like to eat and live inside so I go to work everyday.", "Has she given any explanation for why she won\u2019t use her savings?"]}
