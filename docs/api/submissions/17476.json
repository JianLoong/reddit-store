I said as shit as it may be she'll eithre have to stay at her current job or pay her half of the rent and bills from her savings. She accused me of not being supporting and started talking about how I knew she hated it at her job and should want to help her.

It feels like a lot of hoops, especially while depressed, but it will take some of the financial strain off of both of you while she heals.", "NTA. Especially if she has savings!

That way she keeps working but also has a way out of her job that won't bankrupt you.", "NTA - she's the one not being supportive by not being proactive.  If she doesn't like it at her job then she needs to find a new one as well as being able to balance out the finances.  I feel like she is taking advantage of you because she just doesn't want to work.  How would she be approaching her scenario if she didn't have you to SUPPORT her.  She wants to be taken care of which if a far cry from \"being supportive\".  You have been very supportive.", "NTA. \n\nIt's one thing to leave work involuntarily, or for serious health problems. It's quite another to give up a job because you don't like it, and expect other people to carry your ass. \n\nHonestly I think that if you allow her to freeload, you'll never stop. She'll let you work yourself to death rather than getting a job herself. Just my opinion based on a lifetime of knowing some people who ALWAYS seem to have a reason to quit their jobs.", "NTA this is emotional manipulation from someone who really just wants to stop making an effort and coast through life.

Don\u2019t be surprised if shes trying to set this up so she doesn\u2019t have to work at all. And why is it ok for you to tap into emergency saving but she can\u2019t tap into hers. Double standard much. I\u2019d be frank with her. You can quit. But refusing to pay ur part of shared expenses is a deal breaker for me. Be prepared to follow thru tho which may mean moving or evicting. Depending on ur current situation.", "NTA. Girlfriend is selfish and manipulative though.

What is it about today's young adults that they think that a depressing job is a good excuse to just quit and let someone else pick up the bills indefinitely?\n\nMost able bodied adults need to work to support themselves, period. Don't like your job? Grin and bear it and apply for something else. Yes, do it while you are still employed. Boomers did this for decades; milennials can too. \n\nI cannot even begin to count the many times I got frustrated/depressed with my work. I endured discrimination and sexual harassment before they became household words. You just suck it up and take responsibility for your life.", "NTA. You've been to this party before, and at 75% it didn't sound fun. Supportive does not mean being a doormat and sucking up 100% because she doesn't like her job and doesn't want to find a new one before quitting. She can pay from her savings and/or land a new job, asking you to use your savings rather than hers is selfish.", "NTA. How old is she? I assume she's a grown ass adult. And as grown ass adults we realize that we are responsible for things that we own/use. My husband and I both contribute to the household bills and he could technically cover everything should I decide to be extremely irresponsible and quit my job just because its not fun anymore. But as a grown ass adult, I fully realize that doing so would be a detriment to the family finances. \n\nFor her to expect that you will use all of your savings to cover her portion of the bills because she doesn't like her job is irresponsible and childish. If she wants to quit her job, she uses her savings to make up the difference until her magical unicorn dream job appears. Which let's be honest, she sounds like she'd like to be a stay at home girlfriend. Please don't upgrade her to stay at home wife!", "NTA - if she has savings to dip into, she needs to do that first if she quits her job without having another lined up.

I've had maybe 2 jobs I \"enjoyed\" and even that term doesn't feel like the right description. I have depression and a handful of cool acronyms of mental illnesses. But I still work. I hate my current job. I'm doing the work of 3 people. My bosses only got the job because daddy owns the company. But... until I have another job lined up, as an adult, I must suck it up. I'm not asking my boyfriend to pay all the bills. \n\nYour girlfriend needs to grow up and start working on her mental health. It's not going to magically fix itself. She's the only person in the entire world who can make a change.

NTA, but do not keep allowing her to use you for your money like this. She doesn\u2019t sound like she would support you back if you needed it.", "NTA. Why should you have to carry the financial burden of her choice to leave her job. Being willing to do it once when her mental health was poor was extremely supportive. Now it sounds like she wants to take advantage of you. You gave her sound advice to start looking for another job so she can quit the one she hates. This is what most adults have to do. If she quits without having another job lined up, she\u2019s liable to just become a leach. Maybe you can offer to help her update her cover letter and resume or start looking for other jobs, but she\u2019s being manipulative in claiming you\u2019re not being supportive.", "NTA. If she is feeling depressed she needs to find another job or go to therapy. Leaving her job without the ability to pay for her part of the bills is not an option unless she has at least 3-4 months of bill payments saved up that she can pull out of her savings to pay her half", "NTA.  You have lived together for 12 months. She has had 3 months of reduced bills and now is asking again.  This would be a red flag and even a dealbreaker for me.   This is not how adulthood works.", "Totally NTA. \n\nI get why OP\u2019s partner feels desperate. I left a job last year that was really damaging to my mental health, and I completely understand the feeling of losing a little bit of yourself every time you have to go back to that office. It\u2019s awful, and I wouldn\u2019t wish it on anybody. But I kept going back until I had another job in place, because I can\u2019t afford to not have an income. It\u2019s a truly terrible reality to have to live in, but it\u2019s the one we\u2019ve got, and OP\u2019s partner needs to be realistic about it and either keep the job until she gets a new one, or make sure her savings are enough to cover her expenses in the meantime.", "Except I doubt GF has any intention of finding a new job. \n\nIf OP agrees to do this \u201ctemporarily\u201d it will gradually become permanent.\n\nFirst she\u2019ll claim she\u2019s applying but not getting any interviews.\n\nNext, she\u2019ll say they can survive on his salary and isn\u2019t it great to have a SAHGF. \n\nThen she\u2019ll start talking about starting a family and how she can\u2019t wait to be a SAHM.\n\nOP needs to see the bright red flags and rethink his future with GF.", "agreed. But also maybe, since you've only put 2 years in.. should you maybe consider whether this is someone you want to build a life with? If she is comfortable making this kind of demand and putting this kind of strain on you (seemingly for no reason, as well, as you mention that she has savings) what else is she willing to ask of you? And will she always describe you not wanting to agree to an unreasonable situation as being an asshole?\n\nalso, what's with this general feeling in the post that they both seem to think savings isn't money? Like, yeah, it's good to have savings for security and everything, but it's also 100% money.

Maybe compromise is afoot with her offering to pay a certain percentage from savings and paying him back after for what he does cover, but I don't blame OP for being frustrated with her insisting that he has to cover all of the bills if she quits with no plan.", "Yeah, they are suppose to be a team and OP\u2019s partner isn\u2019t acting like it. OP can support her emotionally but requesting them to foot the entire financial bill is very self centered.\n\nNTA OP", "Yes. Making your partner suffer because your decisions is not supporting them, it's enabling their irresponsible behaviors and making them think that every time a job or whatever else doesn't work out, they don't have to lift their weight that they caused and that isn't fair to OP. I too have stayed in horrible toxic and fucking literally abusive work places til I had smthing worth leaving to. It took almost a year to find something with better PAy that hired me and was worh it. I never would have been okay making my partner at that time pay for everything. He couldn't have.

It isn't easy and is a challenge that a lot of people have to figure out.

However, if you want to be long-term with this person, you have to think as a couple.  Both of you need to be willing to support each other during times of crisis.  \n\nDuring 2020 my husband was laid off (as were most people in construction), and we lived on my income (less than $50k) and unemployment.  He's union so he couldn't just go look for another job - he was put in the union pool.  Later in 2020, he was picked back up by his same company, but they had lost almost every other employee to other companies picking up their workers.  So they were extremely light on workers and hardly ever got subcontracted because of that.  My husband was working MAYBE 8-16 hours per week.\n\nFinally in early 2022 I was under so much stress at work that I was about to snap.  I told my husband that he needed to be prepared for me to quit my job, and we needed a better safety net of income.  The whole time he was laid off and during COVID, I never got a single break - I was never furloughed or anything.  And it was so hard to be pushing myself to the limits when he could spend the majority of his working hours at home catching up on TV (and doing housework...he's not an ass) because he wasn't being subcontracted.  So I was like, \"You need to get back to 40 hours so if I have a full mental breakdown, we still have an income.\"\n\nLuckily my company freaked when they heard I was gearing up to quit and they took a bunch of projects off my plate so I'd stay.  But my husband did get up and apply for a different company in the union, and luckily his previous company understood and let him go.\n\nSo, moral of the story...you need to support your girlfriend, sure.
