After she moved she made everybody else in my husband\u2019s family move with her as well ignoring the fact that our life here in WA is set! We have decent jobs and a lovely home. So after awhile, MIL also moved there and also started nagging us about moving. Many stories aside, you see we don\u2019t have the same mentality, same lifestyle, even my husband is angry/disappointed at them for doing stupid things that they do, especially in parenting.\n\nOur daughter turns 6 a few wks ago. Last yr MIL came to visit her on her birthday and wanted us to take her to NC so she can spend the summer there with other family members. We said we can\u2019t leave for that long then she offer to take my daughter there and my BIL will bring her back home after July 4th. I definitely said no. She was frking 5!! I can\u2019t let her go across the country without any parents!? Left alone we don\u2019t like how they \u201cspend time\u201d with the kids at all! All they do is to throw each of them an iPad to play with and call it good. The oldest grandkid (who is now 10) has a frking biggest ipad (laptop size) since 6 and spend at least 6hrs/day on it! \n\nBut when MiL got back last year, she kept whispering the idea of spending summer in NC to my daughter and that made her really excited. One thing led to another, they put me in the spot where I can\u2019t say no. I don\u2019t wanna be \u201cthe bad guy\u201d here. So end up my daughter spent 2 wks last yr in NC through July 4. Husband & I were devastated. So were our daughter. The day she left she realized we\u2019re not with her and she cried to sleep. after the thrill of the 1st week, she got so homesick and started calling us every hour everyday. \n\nThis year, the same shit happens again. MIL got back for our daughter bday, nagging to her about summer in NC again but this year she\u2019s in school so she can\u2019t leave til the end of June. MIL don\u2019t wanna come back to take her there (?!) so I told my husband if he wants to he can take her, just bring her back with him before July 4th. I wanna celebrate the holiday with my kid! This dumbass kept promising her to book her ticket to NC and let his brother bring her back just like last yr. I lost it.. it happens exactly how things was last yr!!! I asked him why did he think it\u2019s a good idea to take my daughter away from me on the holiday. He claims that he only said it but hasn\u2019t buy her ticket or anything (which I know he will and if not, what are you trying to teach a 6yrs old here??) He ends up left me hanging in the middle of the fight with \u201cthen YOU figure it out\u201d and got mad at me. Please tell me what do I have to figure out here?? My MIL is using my daughter after she cant convince us!! Why do I have to figure things out?? And most importantly figure WHAT out??\n\nPlease young moms out there, would you let your 6 yrs old spend 2 weeks across the country without you?

He\u2019s putting them above his child\u2019s welfare. If he can\u2019t see this then some parenting classes are in order.

An in law problem; and a communication problem with your husband when it comes to parenting decisions. \nYour MIL needs boundaries. She should not be manipulating your daughter into wanting to go. A trip like that should be discussed with you and your husband FIRST before discussing it the child. \nAs far as letting your 6 year old go out of town without you; it\u2019s not that uncommon; even at 6. Long vacations with extended family can be great for the kids; and can give the parents a bit of break. (I used to go to the beach with my grandparents, aunts, uncles and cousins sometimes my parents couldn\u2019t take that much time off work.)

Also, make it clear to the grandma y\u2019all aren\u2019t moving to be with them. I\u2019m sure your husband misses his family. It\u2019s also common for kids to visit grandmas for long periods of time without parents. Building up for longer periods could be a possibility. However, only slowly and on your timeline. It sounds like you have resentment her for moving away. Her being away on a holiday sounds like a bad idea to you. Which is fair. It\u2019s your kid! You want time with her too. Husband either buys the tickets with him and daughter or nobody is going this year. It\u2019s reasonable for wanting her gone only a week. \nEdited", "ESH but your daughter.", "NTA.

And while it is nice to celebrate 4th of July as a family, I'm sure she had fun celebrating there and you get to spend all the other holidays with her. \"Devestated\" should really be reserved for worse things.  \nThat being said,  you are the parent.  Your MIL shouldn't have gone behind your back, and your husband is the father and partner. He shouldn't be making plans without discussing with you.  If you insist on having her back for 4th of July, then that needs to be worked out. Also, you need to talk to your daughter and make sure she understands what she is signing up for because calling every hour for a week is not an option. She needs to understand that if she wants to go, she's in it for the ride. If you think she is too young to make this choice, then you get to make it for it.  I do believe that unless grandma is really abusive or negligent, in which case you'd want to cut all ties with her,  spending time with extended family is important. Yes,  five is very young but that has already happened. No reason to think she'll have a harder time at six than she did at five.", "It\u2019s time to go NC with grandma in NC.\n\nGrandma can\u2019t whisper the idea into your *five year olds* ear if she is never around her.

Separation anxiety is real, but they will get over it.  You might not like her iPad rearing ways, but for two weeks, it won't hurt her.  Besides, her visiting is a special time, not an all-the-time thing, so Grandma will probably do more with them.\n\nMy family has been hours away from grandma for 8 years now.  Every year, they go and visit for a few weeks.  My wife and I get a break and work on relationship stuff.  Like doing stuff we did before our lovely family came about.\n\nEdit: As I recall, when my boy was that age, he would get homesick and call.  He would be happy and fun all day, be sad on the call and be happy after that.      It was hard on mom, too.

What *I'm not comfortable with* is the idea of burdening my mom as on duty all the time for my children. That's not her job. Its mine.\n\nPlus I want to see my kids when they are out of school. I don't want to outsource their care and not have the opportunity to be with them.\n\nSo, NTA. The offer isn't working for you. So, explain that you'll miss the moments and just aren't willing to miss everything for weeks and weeks. If the whole summer is too long for you, tell her you'd be happy to facetime every day.", "Say NO. \n\nNo way in hell would I let my kid go with those people.", "Please grow a backbone and simply be a better mom. Good moms decide what is best for their kid and don\u2019t allow themselves to get pressured into bad ideas. \n\nYTA because you agreed the first time, in spite of it being against your better judgment.  Don\u2019t make the same mistake twice. Being a parent and a grownup sometimes makes you \u201cbe the bad guy\u201d. I hate to think what your kid\u2019s teenage years are going to look like if you can\u2019t stand to say\u201dno\u201d.", "Tell gma that next time she brings it up she will be in a very, very long timeout.

End of discussion. \n\nThat's how you handle it.", "Absolutely not. You have to be the bad guy here. My mother is a HC narcissist like this and would whisper things like this to my kids when they were little. I would say \u201cwe can\u2019t, we have plans\u201d and leave it at that. I\u2019ve always said no to her taking the kids unsupervised because of how she was growing up and she knows this, but pretends not to. \n\nShe will get angry, but she has to deal with it. If you don\u2019t keep enforcing that boundary people like this will walk all over it. They have no self awareness", "Ever since a friend pointed out that we get our kids for 18 summers, I started being way more covetous of the times we have to share.", "I swear this was written by a 16 year old. All the exclamation marks, and not spelling out words fully. \n\nBut yeah you're right.

It makes them feel secure, and they know that they don't have to navigate the adult world yet. Sometimes they don't think they want them, but they're happier when they have them.\n\nSet those limits. Let your daughter know you're handling it. The end result will be a happier and healthier child, even if she doesn't think so right now. That's your your job.", "So you are letting you and your daughter to get hurt just because you dont want to say \"No\"??  Your daughter is 6; of course she is going to get exited if somebody hypes her, and then would cry to sleep when she realized that she is surrendered by people she really doesnt know away from mummy and daddy. Imagine if your mother would just have shipped you with some distant relatives at that age! You would have hate her! \n\nYour husband is a coward as well. Why is he unable to say \"No\" to his own mother that is taking your daughter away? Why are you? Who cares if your In Laws get mad? How is that worse that knowing that your daughter is crying to sleep away from you and you are not able to confort? \n\nYou dont need to make a comprise with anyone or give explaination. No is a full phrase. You dont want your daughter away and it is final. No further discussions: everytime they open that door, you close it with a NO. Your daughter will make her decision when she is older.", "I really think you should (or actually your husband) should tell your MIL that she is ruining her visits to see you and maybe she shouldn\u2019t come anymore if all she does is want to take your child away from you.", "This is the way.

Two years ago she spent a week with my mom while my dad helped me move. She had a ball. At 6, she would love to stay with them.\n\nThat being said im going with NAH. You have a mil and husband problem. Why are they pressuring you? Why isnt your husband dealing with his family? Tell him to figure it out but you want your daughter back by a certain date. Book the tickets if you have to.", "You need to be a parent and put your foot down, don\u2019t let your young child take charge, you have to be a parent and sometimes be the bad guy because you can\u2019t always say yes to everything, your Going ti raise her to get things her way and not knowing what no is. Also for your MIL ignore her if she keeps nagging the only way she can spend summer far away is if you or your husband take her. I would like to add im Hispanic and it\u2019s very normal for our parents to send us to Mexico alone to stay with relatives Igor the summer, that\u2019s just us though so i my culture I would be ok with my kid being away with grama but if you honestly don\u2019t like the idea don\u2019t do it! Take control and don\u2019t be afraid to say no to everyone.", "NTA.  No is a full sentence and you are supposed to be the bad guy because you are a parent.  You are supposed to say no to things that will hurt your child.", "ESH\n\nYou can say no and be the bad guy: welcome to parenthood. Your husband should back you up. MIL should have taken your first response and never said anything to your child. \n\nBut as a grandchild who spend every school holiday, weekend, and would spend three weeks at a time with my grandparents (had to come home for the weekend then back to them) starting when I was 4, I treasure those memories. I saw so much of the country, learned about my family history, and forged a relationship with my grandparents that continues through my children with their grandparents and great-grandparents. We were not across the country but often had a state between us.", "ESH.\n\nI don't understand how you can't say no, and how you can let everyone around you be in control of your family.\n\nNo. It's \"No, you can't take daughter. No, not even for a week. No, we're not moving. No, I don't agree with your choices. No, no and also, no.\"\n\nYou have to be the parent, OP. This is not something you can delegate.", "This. OP, your 6yo cannot protect herself from people who don't have her best interests in mind. This is her parents' job. She got so homesick and you guys didn't go get her?

Or that other countries exist, I don't know.", "And - if you know MIL is manipulative and plants ideas in your daughter\u2019s mind - stop letting her have access to your daughter.\n\nPlus, after the last trip (crying/home sickness) you can just say she\u2019s not ready to travel alone right now.\n\nYou are your daughter\u2019s protector - so protect her.", "If your instincts are that they can\u2019t be trusted, you should listen to them.

They are not pets. \n\nStop worrying about being the bad guy or the good guy. You aren't either one. You are the mother so act like it. \n\nJust stop the whole thing.

Be firm because your husband is useless.", "You really could used some parenting courses.  You\u2019re failing your poor daughter.", "NTA. I feel the blood pressure in my brain over this one.  I\u2019m going to use euphemism\u2019s here, but you need to get this absolutely straight, it\u2019s your job to protect your child. You cannot unring a bell. A child that young should not be going anywhere without the supervision of her parents. I retired from juvenile court and you would not believe how often kids are \u201cmistreated\u201d at grandmas house by older cousins, aunts, uncles etc. Accept the fact that you are the adult responsible for the well being of that child and say no. Grandma can come visit at your house. Or she can see all of you when the family visits over there. Period. If you let her go, you would definitely be the AH.", "that sounds amazing", "I love this. Smart smart friend.", "I am an old mom (Xer), but I have a kid the same age. I also live near you, and my folks are close to where your in-laws are. My mother asks for a similar visit all the time. \"Send the kids to me!\" It is super simple. You just say no. If she wants to see them, she has to come here or wait for me to come visit them on my schedule. You aren't at all TA for saying no. That said, I am going with ESH. Here is why:\n\n>After she moved she made everybody else in my husband\u2019s family move with her as well ignoring the fact that our life here in WA is set! \n\nC'mon. No, she didn't. She didn't \"make\" anyone do anything. They chose to do it, and you are mad about it. That's fine, but she didn't force them.\n\n\n>But when MiL got back last year, she kept whispering the idea of spending summer in NC to my daughter and that made her really excited. One thing led to another, they put me in the spot where I can\u2019t say no. I don\u2019t wanna be \u201cthe bad guy\u201d here. So end up my daughter spent 2 wks last yr in NC through July 4.\n\nThis is the time to polish up your shiny spine and say no. Parents say no all the time. It is in the job description. If you see your mother in law saying this stuff to the kiddo, you cut her off. \"Yeah, Grandma has some fun ideas, but we aren't going to do that.\" Then you talk to MiL privately about not doing that. If it is on the phone, you say you have to go, and hang up. Redirect just like you would a toddler who wanted to play with a glass figurine.\n\nYour husband also needs to polish up his spine, too. He needs to say no and back you up, or he needs to be honest with you to say he wants her to go. Either way, he needs to step up and speak his mind clearly.\n\nJust say no. She lives 2000 miles away. It isn't like she is going to show up on your doorstep. You get to say no, you get to end phone calls, and you get to set limits. Find the will to do it.", "No. You say no. YOU decide what's best for your family.

My time with my kids are limited and I don\u2019t owe it to anyone else.

Is it better for your daughter to be miserable than for you to be uncomfortable. Get it together! ESH", "Say no and stick to it.
