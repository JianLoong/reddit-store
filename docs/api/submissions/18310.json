After she moved she made everybody else in my husband\u2019s family move with her as well ignoring the fact that our life here in WA is set! We have decent jobs and a lovely home. So after awhile, MIL also moved there and also started nagging us about moving. Many stories aside, you see we don\u2019t have the same mentality, same lifestyle, even my husband is angry/disappointed at them for doing stupid things that they do, especially in parenting.\n\nOur daughter turns 6 a few wks ago. Last yr MIL came to visit her on her birthday and wanted us to take her to NC so she can spend the summer there with other family members. We said we can\u2019t leave for that long then she offer to take my daughter there and my BIL will bring her back home after July 4th. I definitely said no. She was frking 5!! I can\u2019t let her go across the country without any parents!? Left alone we don\u2019t like how they \u201cspend time\u201d with the kids at all! All they do is to throw each of them an iPad to play with and call it good. The oldest grandkid (who is now 10) has a frking biggest ipad (laptop size) since 6 and spend at least 6hrs/day on it! \n\nBut when MiL got back last year, she kept whispering the idea of spending summer in NC to my daughter and that made her really excited. One thing led to another, they put me in the spot where I can\u2019t say no. I don\u2019t wanna be \u201cthe bad guy\u201d here. So end up my daughter spent 2 wks last yr in NC through July 4. Husband & I were devastated. So were our daughter. The day she left she realized we\u2019re not with her and she cried to sleep. after the thrill of the 1st week, she got so homesick and started calling us every hour everyday. \n\nThis year, the same shit happens again. MIL got back for our daughter bday, nagging to her about summer in NC again but this year she\u2019s in school so she can\u2019t leave til the end of June. MIL don\u2019t wanna come back to take her there (?!) so I told my husband if he wants to he can take her, just bring her back with him before July 4th. I wanna celebrate the holiday with my kid! This dumbass kept promising her to book her ticket to NC and let his brother bring her back just like last yr. I lost it.. it happens exactly how things was last yr!!! I asked him why did he think it\u2019s a good idea to take my daughter away from me on the holiday. He claims that he only said it but hasn\u2019t buy her ticket or anything (which I know he will and if not, what are you trying to teach a 6yrs old here??) He ends up left me hanging in the middle of the fight with \u201cthen YOU figure it out\u201d and got mad at me. Please tell me what do I have to figure out here?? My MIL is using my daughter after she cant convince us!! Why do I have to figure things out?? And most importantly figure WHAT out??\n\nPlease young moms out there, would you let your 6 yrs old spend 2 weeks across the country without you?

He\u2019s putting them above his child\u2019s welfare. If he can\u2019t see this then some parenting classes are in order. As parents, our obligation is to do what\u2019s best for them not what keeps the peace with other people.", "You sound like you have a couple issues. An in law problem; and a communication problem with your husband when it comes to parenting decisions. \nYour MIL needs boundaries. She should not be manipulating your daughter into wanting to go. A trip like that should be discussed with you and your husband FIRST before discussing it the child. \nAs far as letting your 6 year old go out of town without you; it\u2019s not that uncommon; even at 6. Long vacations with extended family can be great for the kids; and can give the parents a bit of break. (I used to go to the beach with my grandparents, aunts, uncles and cousins sometimes my parents couldn\u2019t take that much time off work.)

When you said \"But when MiL got back last year, she kept whispering the idea of spending summer in NC to my daughter, and that made her really excited.\" I first thought that this was manipulation and she is a bad influence on your daughter.

Also, make it clear to the grandma y\u2019all aren\u2019t moving to be with them. I\u2019m sure your husband misses his family. It\u2019s also common for kids to visit grandmas for long periods of time without parents. Building up for longer periods could be a possibility. However, only slowly and on your timeline. It sounds like you have resentment her for moving away. Her being away on a holiday sounds like a bad idea to you. Which is fair. It\u2019s your kid! You want time with her too. Husband either buys the tickets with him and daughter or nobody is going this year. It\u2019s reasonable for wanting her gone only a week. \nEdited", "ESH but your daughter.", "NTA.

And while it is nice to celebrate 4th of July as a family, I'm sure she had fun celebrating there and you get to spend all the other holidays with her. \"Devestated\" should really be reserved for worse things.  \nThat being said,  you are the parent.  Your MIL shouldn't have gone behind your back, and your husband is the father and partner. He shouldn't be making plans without discussing with you.  If you insist on having her back for 4th of July, then that needs to be worked out. Also, you need to talk to your daughter and make sure she understands what she is signing up for because calling every hour for a week is not an option. She needs to understand that if she wants to go, she's in it for the ride. If you think she is too young to make this choice, then you get to make it for it.  I do believe that unless grandma is really abusive or negligent, in which case you'd want to cut all ties with her,  spending time with extended family is important. Yes,  five is very young but that has already happened. No reason to think she'll have a harder time at six than she did at five.", "It\u2019s time to go NC with grandma in NC.\n\nGrandma can\u2019t whisper the idea into your *five year olds* ear if she is never around her.

Being a good parent often means being the \"bad guy.\"  My husband and often trade off being the \"bad guy\" with our families or friends.

Separation anxiety is real, but they will get over it.  You might not like her iPad rearing ways, but for two weeks, it won't hurt her.  Besides, her visiting is a special time, not an all-the-time thing, so Grandma will probably do more with them.\n\nMy family has been hours away from grandma for 8 years now.  Every year, they go and visit for a few weeks.  My wife and I get a break and work on relationship stuff.  Like doing stuff we did before our lovely family came about.\n\nEdit: As I recall, when my boy was that age, he would get homesick and call.  He would be happy and fun all day, be sad on the call and be happy after that.      It was hard on mom, too.
