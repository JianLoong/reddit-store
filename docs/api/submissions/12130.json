Otherwise she can't go.", "selftext": "Due to a serious illness my daughter Jayce (13F) went through a few years ago, she had to repeat a grade after spending so much time in the hospital.  She requires specialized care for the time being.  The only people who know about it are her teachers and other school staff.  This is something she doesn't want her classmates to know because she's embarrassed.  They know she was sick, but not the details.\n\nJayce's middle school has an annual overnight trip to New York.  Normally the kids would be rooming with each other.  With Jayce's needs, I have the okay from the school to come on the trip as a chaperone.  Jayce and I are sharing a room so I can help her if needed.  \n\nAnother mom, Trish, in her grade reached out to me recently.  She has a child, Corrie (13MTF) who wants to go on the trip but isn't able to room with the other kids.  She doesn't want to room with the boys, and the school will not let her bunk with the girls.  Trish can't come on the trip, so she asked if Corrie can room with us.  \n\nI told Trish I would get back in touch with her on Monday.  But to be frank, I am not comfortable with Corrie staying with us.  Here's why: 1) Jayce and Corrie are not friends.  Jayce doesn't even like Corrie because she runs her mouth too much in class and has picked on a few other kids, 2) she's afraid Corrie will tell everyone about her special needs.  3) I'm not comfortable with having another kid I don't know well sharing a room with us.  Especially since we're keeping some of Jayce's equipment in the room, which includes syringes.  It's too much of a liability. \n\nI feel bad for Corrie.  Her choices are limited.  Trish sounded desperate in her email.  I had asked if she talked to the school district, but I don't think it worked out for her.  She says that her only options are to make her room with the boys or not go on the trip at all.\n\nAs bad as I feel for Corrie, I have to think about Jayce and her needs at the end of the day.  If she doesn't want to room with Corrie, she doesn't want to room with Corrie.  \n\nI haven't gotten back with Trish yet, but I am thinking about taking the email to their teacher to get her insight.  \n\nIn the meantime, AITA?", "created_utc": 1678644201, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11pl5ro/wibta_if_i_dont_allow_my_daughters_classmate_to/", "score": 68, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I feel sorry for Corrie, who it doesn\u2019t sound like has any good options for this trip, but it\u2019s not your responsibility to fix the problem.

I got stuck with someone I wouldn\u2019t have picked on an overnight trip on high school and all she did was make that trip miserable because all she\u2019d do is try to fight with me about the guy I was crushing on, and also went into my bag to eat some candy I had bought that day. When I learned the friends I had hoped to bunk with were manipulated by another about me being horrible to room with it actually ruined some friendships for me.

Even if your child is there and you're another mother.

An awkward situation, but if your daughter has some sensitive care needs including specialised medical equipment, there shouldn't be anyone else in her room except her carers/family. \n\nIf she doesn't trust Corrie to keep these sensitive issues to herself, she must not be put in that situation. You may have to explain to Corrie's mother in a little more detail what these care needs are, so that she doesn't think the wrong thing.

Hopefully Trish will see it the same way you do in you are protecting your child, something she would probably do if in your shoes. It sounds like you are doing great as a parent!!", "NTA.
