If the person you were making fun of wasn't laughing, then it wasn't a funny joke, it was bullying.", "YTA\n\nYou just couldn't help yourself, could you? Instead of making it nice for her, when everyone was already nervous, you had to ruin it for her. You're that kind of a parent.", "YTA, obviously. Being a teenage girl is hard enough without this. She brought someone who matters to her home and surely you knew she wanted everyone to make good impressions. Instead of saving your lame joke for way down the line you purposely embarrassed her the very first time you met. Not cool, and you only have yourself to blame if you don\u2019t get to meet future love interests in a normal time frame.", "YTA\n\nYou literally made your daughter the butt of your jokes at a time when she needed your support. I hope the laughs you got at her expense were worth it.", "Yta. Worst dad ever? No. But in her eyes, yeah. You humiliated a young woman in a horribly awkward time of life in front of a young man she cares for. My brother did this sort of thing to me growing up and I still feel the remnants of embarrassment. And....have never introduced bfs to him since.", "YTA\n\nI mean, just a little bit, but come on! Your wife did have to kick you for you to say you were kidding. She is a teen girl and you had her boyfriend laughing at her. I don\u2019t think you are the worst dad ever, but don\u2019t do that again!", "YTA. You knew it was inappropriate then and now. You knew it would embarrass her. And you did it anyway.", "YTA\n\nDon't do it again.", "Was this the first time he'd ever been over? And has your wife had to kick you under the table in other situations?\n\nIMHO YTA but you need to decide this for yourself. Is your daughter a sensitive person? How long has she been with this guy? \n\nAll I know is that as a father, you should be setting the tone as to how your daughter should be treated. If you are modeling \"jokes\" about her that she finds offensive, what does that say about how you expect her future partners to treat her? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFYI - You may have a future where your daughter is very LC with you and doesn't share anything about her personal life. You don't seem like a safe place to land.", "YTA\n\nIf your daughter has your sense of humor and is old enough to laugh at that, you can all have fun.  But if she\u2019s not there yet, and you know it, YTA\n\nMen far too often make \u201chumor\u201d at the expense of the women in their lives.  If they aren\u2019t laughing WITH you, it was at them.  If you \u201cdidn\u2019t know\u201d it\u2019s as bad.  She\u2019s your kid, if you don\u2019t have a sense of her reaction you\u2019re still TA", "YTA - Best case, you said it not giving a shit that your daughter would feel humiliated; worst case you deliberately wanted your daughter to feel humiliated.", "YTA, but not a big one. How could you not know what you said was embarassing? No teenage daughter wants to hear her dad say things like that in front of her boyfriend.", "You can be the guy who gets cheap laughs at the expense of others or the dad that\u2019s a safe place (also emotionally) for his kids. Guess which one you were at dinner? \n\nYou may not have intended to hurt her but you surely didn\u2019t excel at reading the room either.. and instead of validating that you hit the wrong note with your daughter by apologizing you tried to downplay her feelings with \u201ejust kidding\u201c. There\u2019s no apology without accountability. \n\nBtw ending your post with \u201eam i the worst dad ever\u201c comes off as really condescending and fits right in with the rest of the story. YTA", "Hey you.  I see you. You will continue to be the bully who thinks he\u2019s a joker.  Deliberately embarrassing someone, calling it a joke, maybe saying something like \u201c I\u2019m so bad! *wink* *guffaw*\u201d is just you being an ah.  So YTA. Teasing and making someone feel like shit isn\u2019t a joke. It\u2019s bullying.  Getting a group, however small, to join you in teasing someone is evil.", "YTA, but I think everyone will live.", "Lol, bog standard dad joke\n\nNTA", "NTA. I mean i can see where she'd be embarrassed but you weren't being mean and it WAS funny.  \n\nId have been thrilled if my dad was that friendly towards my dates", "Your farts can\u2019t possibly smell as bad as that \u2018joke\u2019 did.\n\nYTA", "NTA. Your daughter is being dramatic.  Signed a mom who raised a teenaged daughter.", "NTA. It's a joke I can totally see my dad making lol.\n\nIt's a harmless joke. But now you know your daughter doesn't like being the butt of these kind of jokes, so best avoid them in the future.", "NTA, just pure dad comedy", "NTA, you showed your daughters BF that you are a fun and open dad, and embarassing your kids (within reason) is the only reason to have them. I'd want you to be my step dad", "NTA I fuckin love your humor, exactly how I am and how I'm going to be when my son gets older \ud83e\udd23", "NTA, you're just being a silly dad. I would be frickin mortified if my dad did this to me while I was a teen, but now I know I'd find it hysterical in retrospect. You're not the worst dad ever, it understandably ruffled her feathers but good call on apologizing.", "NTA. Dad jokes are part of the good dad package. Apologize if she\u2019s feeling bad, but an AH you are not.", "YTA.  I know you are the worst dad but you are an AH.", "NTA. I would have loved for my dad to even be around and make jokes like this. If only that light hearted picking was the worst thing I've read about parents doing to their children on here.", "It's really not the end of the world despite the fact that some people here think it is the end of the world. As long as you are generally a good dad it should not be a big deal. Perhaps another apology and a small gift, and don't do it again. Your daughter clearly doesn't share your sense of humour. NAH.", "NTA. My guess is that the boyfriend didn't mind the joke if he really likes your daughter, warts and all. What was his reaction by the way? Everybody farts, right. You're not with family (future family) if you can't take a joke. You only wanted to have some laugh but it fell flat to your wife and daughter. Because maybe they want to have a nice first impression, appear prim and proper (?).", "NTA. How thin skinned are you guys? Learn to take a joke.

I'm sure that your kind of \"joking\" has cost you more than one relationship. Your wife is telling you something, and you aren't listening. \n\nAgain - watch the messages you send your daughter with your behavior and think about what you want your relationship to look like when you are in your 70s.

You don\u2019t think there are situations where a joke at someone\u2019s expense is at a really inconvenient time? She\u2019s got her boyfriend with her parents for the first time and that\u2019s probably already a nerve-wracking experience. \n\nLook at how badly you are handling my comment.

Possibly funny for a son, humiliating for most daughters.", "What sort of double standard are you trying to grasp onto for dear life and why? Man up. I bet you want women to be equal right?", "It's not a double standard to behave and joke around in different ways with different people. I joke with my girlfriends differently than I do with my guy friends. I joke with my dad differently than I do my mom. I joke with my bf differently than I do with my boss. I joke differently with my colleagues than I do with the vp of the company.  Different people. Different tooics. It's called social acumen. Tact.", "Its not so much a double standard as it is *recognising* double standards. Like, if you joked about your son spending ages putting on makeup or even being short or something thats quite a different ballgame to saying the same thing about your daughter. \n\nIn both cases its obviously dependant on the person, some women would laugh at the fart joke and be offended by the makeup one and vice versa for men. But generally social attitudes should be factored in when determining if a joke will be taken light banter or outright mocking someone.", "It is a double standard when you\u2019re making a blanket statement that it\u2019s ok to joke about that with sons and not daughters.", "It's not a blanket statement when I say POSSIBLY sons and MOST daughters.  Bathroom humor is not common with teenage girls in front of bfs.", "According to who? Do you have statistics on that? Everybody farts or pisses or shits. It\u2019s 100% a double standard to think it\u2019s ok to joke about that with your son but not your daughter.", "If u need statistics to understand that fart and shit jokes are more common amongst boys than girls then you are lacking common sense. Personally, I wouldn't try to embarrass my son or daughter by commenting on private or personal matters in front of their bf/gf. I was pointing out that it wud be POSSIBLY more ok with a son bc that sort of humor is more common with boys and a son may not have been humiliated by such a joke."]}
