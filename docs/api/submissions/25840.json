She brought someone who matters to her home and surely you knew she wanted everyone to make good impressions. Instead of saving your lame joke for way down the line you purposely embarrassed her the very first time you met. Not cool, and you only have yourself to blame if you don\u2019t get to meet future love interests in a normal time frame.", "YTA\n\nYou literally made your daughter the butt of your jokes at a time when she needed your support. I hope the laughs you got at her expense were worth it.", "Yta. Worst dad ever? No. But in her eyes, yeah. You humiliated a young woman in a horribly awkward time of life in front of a young man she cares for.

And you did it anyway.", "YTA\n\nDon't do it again.", "Was this the first time he'd ever been over? And has your wife had to kick you under the table in other situations?\n\nIMHO YTA but you need to decide this for yourself. Is your daughter a sensitive person? How long has she been with this guy? \n\nAll I know is that as a father, you should be setting the tone as to how your daughter should be treated. If you are modeling \"jokes\" about her that she finds offensive, what does that say about how you expect her future partners to treat her? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFYI - You may have a future where your daughter is very LC with you and doesn't share anything about her personal life.

Guess which one you were at dinner? \n\nYou may not have intended to hurt her but you surely didn\u2019t excel at reading the room either.. and instead of validating that you hit the wrong note with your daughter by apologizing you tried to downplay her feelings with \u201ejust kidding\u201c.

That's a very, very harmless joke and to some degree I feel that we have to stop nurturing people's emotions.
