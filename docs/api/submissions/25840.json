How long has she been with this guy? \n\nAll I know is that as a father, you should be setting the tone as to how your daughter should be treated. If you are modeling \"jokes\" about her that she finds offensive, what does that say about how you expect her future partners to treat her? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFYI - You may have a future where your daughter is very LC with you and doesn't share anything about her personal life.

That's a very, very harmless joke and to some degree I feel that we have to stop nurturing people's emotions.

Don't worry about it, just apologise to your daughter, give her a hug or something and it's as if nothing ever happened.", "Nta. I don\u2019t see a problem. It was a harmless joke and you said it was joke right after. I see why your daughter got butthurt, but come on, it\u2019s nbd. Get over it. Everyone commenting is fucking soft af my dad said way worse in front of gfs growing up", "NTA. It's good to have some laugh. Anyways the relationships & marriages don't work for a long time these days. Atleast you can laugh and crack jokes.", "Isn't this the point of being a dad? When I was younger and going to girlfriends houses their dad's all said funny shit like this. Either you raised a daughter that has thick enough skin to laugh it off or you raised a princess. The former is preferable.", "As someone who was a teenage girl not that long ago, NTA, did it embarrass her, yes, but its a fucking fart joke, key word joke, some people are so sensitive these days, like having a boyfriend, eventually they will start farting like crazy and talking to you about their shit, if you can\u2019t handle being slightly embarrassed in front of your partner, then just watch out until your partner is the one teasing you and embarrassing you", "NTA that was a funny dad moment. Well played, sir.", "NTA. Reddit is insane lmao. Y\u2019all are getting triggered over a fart joke.", "NTA - Dad jokes, good or bad, get a \u201cpass\u201d.", "NTA - It's just banter", "NAH. It\u2019s perfectly normal for parents to embarrass their kids and teenagers to react this way.", "Well said. Wtf, dad. Jfc", "You people have no sense of humour,  didn't realise people where so stuck up.", "Right? Saying that he shouldn\u2019t be surprised if the daughter goes no contact\u2026little excessive over a embarrassing joke.  \n\nI feel like a lot of these people have huge underlying issues and are taking it out on people like OP.", "It has become 100% an outrage sub, as most do. Negative feelings drive engagement the most so the users that get pissed off at the OPs or the subjects participate more.", "No, best case is that he thought it was harmless, given the totally innocuous and obviously silly nature of the joke, plus the overall tone of the conversation at that time.", "Seriously I thought I was the minority\u2026 do redditors not make jokes? I guess they all sat with their families in silence and didn\u2019t make jokes.", "Seriously these people must live extremely sheltered lives. He did nothing that was harmful. I don\u2019t know how any of these people survive in the real world. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "It\u2019s obviously a joke for how ridiculous it is. The comments here are the epitome of AITA being distanced from reality.", "Right?? My dad makes those types of jokes all the time and so does my boyfriend. It's just a dad thing...", "I just think none of this matters because the bf obviously has eyes for the dad.", "It\u2019s literally a fart joke. I think the daughter being extremely angry at him shows he might be doing this too much. But it\u2019s fun banter and some families like to raz each other. If she\u2019s not doing it back then maybe it\u2019s time to see what\u2019s going on, but this seems like it\u2019s way overblown. The boyfriend prob laughed cause it was funny, but I doubt he sees her as a farting monster now.\n\nIf you\u2019re reading this dad - I think you should just ask your daughter what\u2019s going on and see if you could help her with other issues. She might be a little stressed at other things and just needs someone to help work through them. If she really says it\u2019s just those jokes then maybe it\u2019s time to take a break from them.", "This is a teenage daughter, being a teenager is hard enough already. I would do my very best to apologize, make up and change if I was OP.", "Thank GOD for a sensible comment. I mean, wow. The people on this platform really are terminally online. It was a god damn joke. If a dad can\u2019t crack a joke to wind up his teenage daughter without her going \u2018no contact\u2019, I just don\u2019t understand people anymore.", "*This*. **All of this**. People are saying to go no-contact or low-contact over a fart joke??? That\u2019s crazy.", "Honestly this is part of I think a more wide spread problem than most people even realize but a small portion of the population is starting to. That is that your child\u2019s feelings matter and if you start making jokes at their expense at a young age just to \u201ctease them\u201d and then go all \u201coh calm down it was just a joke\u201d when they were the only ones laughing - that\u2019s not funny that\u2019s low key bullying. And of course so many people roll their eyes and are like well it happened to me and I came out fine, not even considering hey what if we - I don\u2019t didn\u2019t treat people like that or make kids think they need to be the butt of jokes for their family to get a laugh? Honestly this whole thread is giving me flashbacks of every single family event of my drunk dad, pulled out standing in the middle of the room and making jokes at my and my moms expense. My feeling and my shame meant nothing if my dad could get all of his siblings and all my cousins laughing at some stupid thing he had to punch down at my mother for or make some smart comment about me taking after her and he\u2019s just here to make sure I\u2019m humbled. He also said a lot worse about my mother\u2019s trouble conceiving/miscarriages but that\u2019s a whole other disaster. Basically my dad knows nothing about me as an adult and still acts like I\u2019m a loose nail that has to be hammered down at any family gathering so it gets a laugh. But he\u2019s basically got dementia so there\u2019s some racist rants in there too. Don\u2019t be like my father and treat your kids like you need to humble them publicly.", "in my experience it was the sexual harassment and assault that was commonly shrugged off because \"boys will be boys\"", "The issue is his obvious deflection. \"Am I the worst dad ever?\" is so damn minimizing. Obviously he isn't, but he did cause harm. By hyperbolizing to that extent he is effectively showing he doesn't actually think what he did warrants an apology. He doesn't truly get that he hurt his daughters feelings (I mean, jesus, kicked under the table by his wife? Is he five and needs scolding?).", "Did you know we are talking about a teenage girl here? They just don't survive this kind of stuff. It's like you don't even understand her feelings. She was part of a joke. Like do you know how much that must have changed how her boyfriend thought about her. He'll never associate her with anything other than heinous farts again. And she isn't like that. After all every one knows women don't poop, piss or fart. /s", "Chatgpt, when you write something in a less uwu-style and you'll be taking more seriously.", "I really hate the right wing \"people are so soft\" bit but what the fuck. This is actually kind of insulting as an actual bully victim. It was a fucking fart joke? He didn't insist she was a smelly farty gal. He made a joke, got input from his wife and flipped it on himself instantly. What in the hell do you think bullying is? There was 0 ill intent and wasn't pushed went rebuked.", "Bro you over exaggerating it so much. He made a fart joke. It\u2019s not that deep. And the boyfriend laughed at it. He clearly doesn\u2019t care.", "\"you're not the worst dad ever but \". Over a fart joke???god damn you're sensitive.", "If I remember teenage boys, there are now non-zero odds that the boyfriend will bring up this joke with the daughter and/or his friends and suddenly daughter is \"Heinous Farts McGee\". High schoolers are ruthless.", "It\u2019s a fart joke. Is it embarrassing, well, yes. For a teenager, probably more. \n\nHonestly, one of the biggest measures of a good relationship is when you can fart / burp / etc near each other and not feel like it\u2019s the end of the world. That sort of thing won\u2019t make me love my partner any less or consider leaving her. \n\nIt\u2019s all a part of growing up. Given dads, funny stories is how they break the ice.\n\nThis kinda hits home for me, because when I got these \u201cstories\u201d from my now wife\u2019s family, I didn\u2019t crack a smile at all. These were not silly stuff like that but her \u201cinability\u201d in the kitchen (while I\u2019m a better cook, she\u2019s can cook well), irresponsible behavior (not true), among others. That honestly ticked me off. \n\nMy girlfriend (now wife) was angry and embarrassed while I was driving her home. Honestly, so was I.", "It\u2019s only a good joke if *everyone* finds it funny. The daughter didn\u2019t. It\u2019s easy enough to just\u2026not make the joke.", "The sad part is, it worked. Like half the comments are dudes who apparently only think what\u2019s funny to them matters, and that the people they\u2019re \u201cjoking\u201d about clearly don\u2019t.", "Good point. She\u2019s going to be very apprehensive about bringing partners over.", "I meant more comfortable with her boyfriend yet, particularly bf meeting the parents.  That\u2019s something that can relax over time", "I would take a fart joke over him cleaning his shotgun and giving the boyfriend the stink eye. I don't understand where you are getting the \"him making dinner about gratifying himself\" that makes 0 sense. He was clearly trying to defuse the tension. What the fuck", "That\u2019s true. Teenage girls are definitely encouraged to feel very secure about their bodies and bodily functions.", "This sub is mostly teenagers who think their parents are SOOO EMBARASSING, if this thread is anything to go off of. \n\nWas it embarrassing for the daughter? Sure. But people seem to equate a very lighthearted tease as him intentionally hurting her, and that's a ridiculous stance.", "seriously, fuck everyone here. Blowing shit so out of proportion.", "Most people on reddit say what they think they ought to say. Not the reality and then they all jump on the bandwagon even if they dont believe what they're saying. That's how reddit is. Everyone's ever so sensitive these days don't you know. How dare a father make a harmless joke infront of his daughters boyfriend at her expense. Off with his head!!!\n\nNTA and no it does not make you the worst father.", "Saw a comment \"being a teenage girl is hard enough...\", wow, this poor daughter has a loving dad and mother, a boyfriend she can bring over to her parents to have dinner. Sounds like a tough life and the fart joke truly ruins her entire teenage years!\n\nWhat the fuck is so bad about a fart joke?", "*I* would have loved a boneheaded dad like this.", "First. Why put joke in quotations. It was literally a joke. And at the expense of his daughter? What expense? He didn't degrade her. He didn't say she shits and facts all over the house all the time to make her sound gross. He joked, got feedback from his wife, and flipped it on himself. Boyfriend laughed, obviously more at ease because of it. Wild optics out here", "What's to be humiliated about? The dad made a fart joke. It's obviously just a nonsense joke and not a reflection on the farts of the daughter or even the dad really", "It was a fart joke, not a fat joke. If her life is ruined by that, I would love to live in that kind of privilege. Honestly, if you think that\u2019s all it takes to ruin a girl\u2019s life, I\u2019d like to live in your privilege too.", "Found my siblings account.", "Like an arrow right to the shart", "This.", "DING DING DING!!!", "a more valid approach is that it was gross to demonstrate that behavior in front of two young men. that\u2019s what changed my view on this", ">But this sub is full of teenagers.\n\nYep. Their view of the world is twisted at that age.", "exactly my thought process", "I think the crux here would be whether that type of joke is common in their family.  If it is, I don't think you can claim it's intentional humiliation. He made a joke inappropriate for the situation, yes. When a family is used to teasing each other amongst themselves, it potentially becomes uncomfortable when non family members are introduced and don't know their humor. Now, the joke might have been the dad's way of welcoming the boyfriend into their family in-jokes as a gesture of acceptance. But what he didn't take into account was how a teenage girl would feel about someone talking about her farts in front of a boy she likes.", "I'm sorry for you and yours that you don't have relationships that are so easy and comfortable that making fun of each other is such an issue.", "how is a fart joke humiliation? literally everyone farts and literally everyone\u2019s farts smell bad. you gotta loosen up dude", "Listen Nanny, you need to chill here. This guy is NTA. Learning how to deal with things that make you a bit uncomfortable is a valuable life skill. This clearly wasn't a case of a father being vindictive and purposely trying to ruin his daughter's life, or relationship, or anything like that. It was an off the cuff joke, that I'm more than willing to bet is probably not the first time something along those lines has been said in their house. You need to get out and touch grass. This crusade ain't it.", "Imagine thinking a casual jab no one takes seriously is humiliation lol. How fragile.\n\nIf he made fun of her teeth or something sure but a fart joke? Cmon man.", "Which is SUPER GREAT for a teen girl.", "One of the top comments: \"being a teenage girl is hard enough...\", idk man, to me it looks like the teenage girl in question has loving parents, has a boyfriend and parents cool enough with it to invite him over to dinner and she even has the luxury to throw a tantrum at her dad over a fart joke! Such a tough life, poor girl! \n\nWe all were teenagers once and I think we can all agree this is just regular dad behaviour. The boyfriend laughed at the joke, she'll eventually fart in front of her boyfriend, why do most people in this comment section seem to think that this fart joke ended the girl's relationship with both her boyfriend and her dad lmfao", "My theory is that how AITA rules has less to do with thoughtful consideration of the ethics involved, and more to do with whatever argument is easiest to make.\n\nThis is why the subreddit tends to be *super* into property rights.

Fluffy little moron tries to stick his head in the stove.", "I don't think he was trying to be actively malicious at first, but his reaction to being called out about it and then being all \"Am I the worst dad ever\" isn't great.
