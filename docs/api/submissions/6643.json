She deserves so much more than you gave her for saying that kind of shit to anyone, but especially to her own child.  Your father may have been abusive and toxic, but those are her issues to work out, and spewing that racist crap at you is just as abusive and toxic and she needs to be called out on that shit.\n\nIf it were me, that would be a full No Contact moment.", "I\u2019m sorry for your mum that she was in an abusive relationship with your father but that doesn\u2019t justify her racism and prejudice. Saying those comments to your own child is unforgivable so your response was justified imo. NTA.", "NTA.  Your mom is way out of line with saying those things.  Sounds like mom is a bit racist.  Maybe she wasn't always, but it looks like at least what happened with your dad has caused her to come to the (incorrect) conclusion that all people of his race are the same.  That's not an excuse.  Mom is a complete and total AH.  I'm so sorry that she is saying those things to you.  I would go low contact (or as low as you can), and start gray rocking her if she starts with these comments again.  And if she asks why, tell her very calmly how these comments make you feel, and that you don't feel like you can have a good relationship with anyone who thinks about you this way.", "NTA. She can't hurl insults about half of who you are all your life and never expect you to say anything. You were right- she made decisions to be with your dad and now you are expected to \"pay\" for his sins and, supposedly the sins of an entire race/culture/ethnicity? Nah. Your mom sounds racist and she deserved the clapback.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like your mom has some weird race issues and for whatever reason she seems to use these racist responses whenever you have a disagreement, and seems to see race as the reason behind any disagreement between you two.  Also, it's harsh but what you are pointing out is true, that essentially she is directing her anger at things that your father did, and that you had no part in towards you.", "NTA\n\nYour Mom sounds racist and bitter. Seems like she's taking her anger out on you since she can't take it out on her ex-husband. She has no right to verbally abuse you and make you her punching bag.", "NTA. \n\nYour mother sounds like a piece of work. No matter her feelings about your father, she shouldn\u2019t be saying these things to you. \n\nI would look at moving out, getting some space, and finding a good therapist to talk to.", "NTA. Your mother is not being racist towards your father or \u201chis people\u201d, she\u2019s being racist to you, and you\u2019re absolutely right, she made that decision to have a child with him. You weren\u2019t victim blaming because the abuse she suffered isn\u2019t what\u2019s being litigated, her treatment of you is.", "> I feel like I victim blamed her\n\nNTA - she may be a victim in some aspects, but she's also still a racist against *her own daughter*. And racists are almost _always_ the AH.", "NTA.  It sounds as if your father isn't the only toxic, abusive parent.  And your mom is a racist as well.  How can she open her mouth and say something like that about her own child?", "Unfortunately sometimes you have to present the harsh truth to parents. It gets better with time.\n\nNTA", "NTA.  Your mom is saying way worse things to you than what you said to her.  She\u2019s racist.", "NTA. Your mother sounds racist", "NTA. Your Mom is openly racist and cruel. Regardless of who your father was, she cannot use him or \u201chis people\u201d as an excuse to be toxic towards you. You didn\u2019t victim blame her, you pointed out that it was her decision to marry and have children with your Dad.", "NTA\n\nThe abuse your mom may have suffered is no excuse for her to be a racist asshole.", "Your mom is racist.  Plain and simple.  It does not matter that she was a victim.  She was a victim of an INDIVIDUAL, not an ethnicity. Sounds like it's time to maybe go NC.\n\n***NTA.***  There's nothing wrong with your dad's ethnicity.  He's an ah, because he's an ah, and so is your mom.  \n\n\nEDIT: spelling", "NTA \n\nYour mom is being manipulative and emotionally abusive constantly running your father down. His failings in THEIR relationship had nothing to do with you.\n\nShe's also being a toxic racist to you and your ethnicity", "NTA - your mother has a very toxic behavior with you. Bringing your ethnicity in argument is stupid to say the least. It's just a manipulative way to shut an argument down when she obviously has nothing smart to say.\n\nWhat you said to her is true. Your not responsible for her choices. She can run crying and give you the silent treatment (again it's very manipulative), but it does not make you wrong. \n\nShe is in the wrong, not you.", "You're NTA. It sounds like you reflected her own beliefs right back to her. You had no control over who your father was, but she did.", "You didn\u2019t hurt your mom\u2019s feelings. You told her the truth. I\u2019m so proud of you OP !! Setting boundaries !! NTA.", "OMG. I don't know how real AHs manage to reverse the roles so that their victims believe the AHs are them. Unbelievable.\n\nSurely your mother's life has not been easy having supposedly endured the toxicity of a partner. But that doesn't give her the right to take the part for the whole, blame an entire ethnicity for a person and, above all, lump you into that fallacy to criticize you. That kind of racism is sick, but using it against your own child is indescribably surreal. And you were right: she made a mistake in choosing the wrong partner and must accept the consequences of her decision. What I regret is that you have not been even harder on her to get rid of her desire to abuse.\n\nNTA.", "NTA - wow, your mom appears to be saying things that are toxic and racist", "NTA\n\nYou didn't blame her for getting abused. That wasn't what the topic was about. She uses your father's cruelty to be discriminatory towards an *entire ethnicity*, including her own daughter. \n\nNo traumatic experience justifies her verbal abuse towards you, who did absolutely nothing. You didn't waste her youth, you (and others of your ethnicity) are not caricatures of whatever negative stereotypes she has. Shes using her trauma to justify dehumanizing an entire group of people and projecting all of it on you. She needs therapy but you need a loving space away from that toxic mentality she has.", "NTA, I feel so sorry about your situation but know this, you didn't tell her to date or marry this guy, she did it on her own, you did nothing!", "NTA. Your mother is racist. Even to you. So not internalize that racism. This isn\u2019t normal. Set some boundaries.", "NTA. Think it through: Your mother is accusing you of abusing you, cause you are just like him. If you ever decide to do therapy, you might stop loving your mom. Cause these sentences are horrible.", "YNTA. Okay, as an individual he may have been an awful human being but she is being racist in general and insulting to you in particular.  The over the top outragousness of her provocation far out weighs the degree of offense in your response.", "NTA\n\nYour mother is toxic for sure. Are you sure you dad is? Have you had any contact? Did he not see you by his choice or hers?\n\nNo mother, actually no one at all should be saying things like that to you.\n\nI would suggest LC while you seek therapy/counselling to understand why the way she treats you is not ok and she is definitely not a great mother", "NTA. No mother should ever talk to their child like that/make them feel guilty for existing. That's really abusive. She also sounds pretty racist. I hope you find the space to look after yourself in this situation.", "She fights with a sword and she cries if you give her a papercut. Pathetic selfish mother. Is she Asian?

If your mom truly feels this way about your ethnicity, that is not a relationship that I think it worth having. You were fully correct in your call out: you did not force her to have a child with a man of a different race. But in that is another truth: you did not get to choose your race or the way you look.
