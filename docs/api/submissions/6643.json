She deserves so much more than you gave her for saying that kind of shit to anyone, but especially to her own child.  Your father may have been abusive and toxic, but those are her issues to work out, and spewing that racist crap at you is just as abusive and toxic and she needs to be called out on that shit.\n\nIf it were me, that would be a full No Contact moment.", "I\u2019m sorry for your mum that she was in an abusive relationship with your father but that doesn\u2019t justify her racism and prejudice. Saying those comments to your own child is unforgivable so your response was justified imo. NTA.", "NTA.  Your mom is way out of line with saying those things.  Sounds like mom is a bit racist.  Maybe she wasn't always, but it looks like at least what happened with your dad has caused her to come to the (incorrect) conclusion that all people of his race are the same.  That's not an excuse.  Mom is a complete and total AH.  I'm so sorry that she is saying those things to you.  I would go low contact (or as low as you can), and start gray rocking her if she starts with these comments again.  And if she asks why, tell her very calmly how these comments make you feel, and that you don't feel like you can have a good relationship with anyone who thinks about you this way.", "NTA. She can't hurl insults about half of who you are all your life and never expect you to say anything.

Your mom sounds racist and she deserved the clapback.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like your mom has some weird race issues and for whatever reason she seems to use these racist responses whenever you have a disagreement, and seems to see race as the reason behind any disagreement between you two.  Also, it's harsh but what you are pointing out is true, that essentially she is directing her anger at things that your father did, and that you had no part in towards you.", "NTA\n\nYour Mom sounds racist and bitter.

Unbelievable.\n\nSurely your mother's life has not been easy having supposedly endured the toxicity of a partner. But that doesn't give her the right to take the part for the whole, blame an entire ethnicity for a person and, above all, lump you into that fallacy to criticize you. That kind of racism is sick, but using it against your own child is indescribably surreal. And you were right: she made a mistake in choosing the wrong partner and must accept the consequences of her decision. What I regret is that you have not been even harder on her to get rid of her desire to abuse.\n\nNTA.", "NTA - wow, your mom appears to be saying things that are toxic and racist", "NTA\n\nYou didn't blame her for getting abused. That wasn't what the topic was about. She uses your father's cruelty to be discriminatory towards an *entire ethnicity*, including her own daughter. \n\nNo traumatic experience justifies her verbal abuse towards you, who did absolutely nothing. You didn't waste her youth, you (and others of your ethnicity) are not caricatures of whatever negative stereotypes she has.

No mother should ever talk to their child like that/make them feel guilty for existing. That's really abusive. She also sounds pretty racist.
