However, I do not have the greatest relationship with her. I do not fit in on what mother thinks is a \u201cgreat\u201d daughter. \n\nLast week, we got into heated argument and I said some words that I wish I could take back. \nFor the background, my father is a different ethnicity than my mother, which makes me obviously mixed. Every time we argue, she starts saying things like \u201cOf course you would act like that, you are that part of that ethnicity\u201d, \u201cI do not expect anything from people of that decent\u201d. \nDuring our last fight she said \u201cEven if you did not saw your father, you act like him and his people\u201d, \u201cI wasted all my youth on you\u201d. That is when I snapped and said \u201cIt is not my fault you married him and had his children. Maybe you should have thought more about your decisions.\u201d She started crying and left to her room and now she is not speaking to me at all. \n\nThe reason why I think I might be the asshole is because I heard stories about my father and he was abusive and toxic. I feel horrible because I feel like I victim blamed her.\n\nEdit. \nThank you guys for all of your answers and comments! This might sound silly but it truly opened my eyes on how racist and toxic my mother is. My family and relatives acted like my mother my whole life. Every time I told relatives about her remarks they would say I am overreacting and agree with her (except my brother). I never told anyone about this outside of my family, so I felt isolated and the weird one for even bringing this issue up. Also, some people are wondering how can I still love my mother. The thing is she would say horrible things, then silent treatment, and then act like nothing happened, after that she would act so kind. She would be so great to me, but then the cycle continues. I guess I just don\u2019t wanna lose that love, however, I understand it is not normal to go through roller coasters like that. I decided to talk to her and say that I will not be in contact with her, if she continues this racist behavior. I actually live in apartment with roommates and just came home to visit on the holidays. Another thing, a lot of people are suggesting that my father was maybe not the bad guy and that perhaps my family portrayed him that way because of his ethnicity. My older brother, who does not share or agree with my moms racism, have told me that my father used to physically and emotionally abuse him all his childhood, so I do not think he is a great man either.", "created_utc": 1673024693, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/104zdsh/aita_for_telling_my_mom_its_not_my_fault_she/", "score": 1361, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

One cannot say everything she said about the father is a lie, but who knows what really happened, considering how abusive she is to her own child? Wanna look at puppies, too.", "NTA you mom has gotten you used to her racist \ud83d\udca9 I would go NC for a year or two & only see her if she promises to quit saying racist stuff to me.\n\nThe very least you can do is start always calling her on it \u201cmom that is racist & a awful thing to say to your own child!\u201d \u201cMom quit being racist.\u201d \u201cWow that is some racist \ud83d\udca9 running around in your head!\u201d If you remain in contact, call her on it every single time.", "\u2026. Yeah. NTA. It sounds like you were raised to gloss over and accept her overt racism. Maybe talk to somebody about that cause it takes a lot of work to drag yourself out of inherited bigotry when that\u2019s your home environment.", "NTA Your father may have beef abusive and toxic but that had nothing to do with you. You didn't ask to be born or ask her to spend her youth raising you. It's not fair for her to throw that up to you. You were a child, that's all.", "NTA. OP, you don\u2019t deserve to be verbally pummeled w/ your so-called mom\u2019s anger and racism. Please, if you\u2019re not in therapy, find a therapist now. My situation with my own mom, though very different from yours re: specifics, is very similar re: the way she treated me and the horrible things she said to me. For years, I was angry and, eventually, I forgave her. But I never worked on truly *healing* until a year ago\u2014and only then bc my life was a fucking disaster. And I turn *60* in two months and three days! You are not what your mother says you are.", "Wow, NTA and I'm so sorry you've had to hear those things from your own mother! Your father being toxic and abusive does not excuse your mother's behavior towards you and all the $hit she's said to you. In fact, she comes off as racist and toxic af (I'm sorry, I'm sure you love her) herself. She's got a lot of growing up and healing to do and this is what therapy is for. Blaming your child for the choices YOU made is never, ever ok!", "You feel horrible? Your mother is throwing negative and hurtful comments in your face comparing you to your father. You told her the truth and she did not like it. Your mother is the AH.", "NTA Your mother endured abuse and abandonment at his hands. That doesn't mean she's entitled to abuse you, emotionally or physically. She says racist things to and about you. It's no wonder you snapped. Suggest joint counseling for you both, and don't take back your words.", "NTA. Your mother is obviously hurting and she's blaming the nearest thing at hand for her unhappiness. Her prejudiced statements carry no weight as an ethnicity is not a monolith; people are still individuals and are individually responsible for their strengths and shortcomings. Given this, you were wrong to rise to your mother's bait. A statement of \"wasted youth\"? what does that even mean? Youth is valuable only in hindsight. The longing for the road not traveled is futile.\n\nAs for these stories you've heard about your father, take them with a grain of salt. It's easy to slander a person and people are prone to jump on the bandwagon. Repeat a lie or an exaggeration often enough, it seems like truth.  Do you have any relationship directly with your father? If not, I'd suggest being cautiously open-minded. Until you have first-hand experience with him, it's just gossip.", "NTA. She\u2019s being racist to her own goddamn child. Saying she \u201cwasted her youth\u201d on you implying she regrets having you is such an awful fucking thing to tell your kid. So messed up. She sounds just as bad as your dad if not worse.", "I agree. OP, your father likely did abuse her and was toxic. But she's being the same way to you.  Do NOT put up with. I'd be clear, \"mom, I'm so sorry dad was abusive. But you DO NOT get to insult my heritage and therefore me. I won't listen to any of this anymore, because its frankly racist and insulting.\"  And shut her down when she starts on such tirades.  Tell her she needs therapy to work on her issues, but that you aren't going to be abused by her anymore. NTA", "Exactly! My Kids are biracial & I've always made it clear that any negatives the present about him are not on race & boil down to him indervidually.", "NTA. Sweetie you are also a victim. It is not okay for your mother to say the things she said to you. She is not only racist, but is racist towards her own child. I am so sorry.", "NTA\n\nIf blaming your ethnicity for disagreeing with her is a common practice then definitely NTA. I\u2019m having a little trouble understanding her comment \u201cyou are that part of that ethnicity\u201d. What ethnicity has exactly the same personality and thought process for everyone? I\u2019m also having a little trouble with a mother that is racist against her own child?\n\nIf this is normal for her, maybe she needed your response.", "NTA at all. your mom is TA. A massive one. Imagine blaming your child for being born. And then promptly being racist to said child by insulting the other part/heritage to which said child belongs. Nasty behaviour. Sounds like mom\u2019s actually at odds with herself and misplacing emotions. She 100% shouldnt be talking to OP like ever.", "The level of racism some people have is wild, but a parent being racist against her own child is a new one.\n\nThere is no level of abuse that justifies what she is saying to you. OP\u2019s post gave me the impression that she doesn\u2019t fully grasp how disgusting and appalling her mother\u2019s behavior is because she\u2019s so used to it and it\u2019s normal to her now. Please believe someone on the outside looking in that this is not normal or acceptable.\n\nNTA", "NTA.  If I were OP, I would cut Mommy Dearest out of my life.", "NTA. She's abusing you. And she's doing so from a racist stand point. I would personally recommend going no-contact with her. You don't owe her anything and you don't need to have a toxic, racist, abusive person in your life.", "NTA", "NTA Your mother is racist and abusive. What she says to you is hateful and cruel. It's not how a loving person, never mind a loving parent, would ever talk to another person. \n\nI know it's hard to see clearly just now. You've grown up with horrible stories about your father. You've been conditioned your whole life to believe you had to take her abuse and that she couldn't help it or you deserved it.\n\nMy hope for you is that this is the beginning of you understanding that your mother is being cruel and abusive. This isn't something you have to take. It isn't something she has a right to do. It isn't something she has a reason to think or say. \n\nWe don't know anything about your father and it's possible you don't either. Maybe he was abusive, maybe he just couldn't take her abuse, maybe they were abusive to each other. What your mother says to you though is very very clear abuse and racism.\n\nThere is nothing that has ever happened to her that justifies the things she says to you.\n\nI was 30 before I realised my mother was abusive. I hope this helps you learn sooner than I did. Because as long as you believe she loves you, you'll never understand your true worth.", "Let me guess moms family is white and dad is black or a POC? Not surprised. NTA.", "Your father may be all those things but your mother is racist and those comments are disturbing. \n\nNTA", "Happy Cake Day! \n\n100% agree with you. Feel bad that OP has to deal with this and now is questioning their own feelings!!", "I hate how often in these cases the answer is racism. OP you're NTA.", "NTA. Your mother is racist and abusive. \n\n>The thing is she would say horrible things, then silent treatment, and then act like nothing happened, after that she would act so kind. She would be so great to me, but then the cycle continues. I guess I just don\u2019t wanna lose that love\n\nThis is an abuse tactic called love bombing, designed to do exactly what it's doing to you. It makes the victim think they're loved and feel loved so they will continue to maintain the abusive relationship and convince themselves the bad times are a result of something other than abuse.", "NTA. As the mother of a son with a different ethnicity NC dad who WAS abusive and toxic... I would never ever tell my difficult and complicated son that it's because of his father's ethnicity. I blame his father for disappearing out of his life, but even that I would never say.", "Definitely NTA! Her racist hurtful remarks are uncalled for and unnecessary. She's emotionally abusing you from the sounds of it. Don't feel bad for having enough of that bs!", "Her comments aren't about your father (even though he may be a world class jerk), but about his race. Face it, your mom is a racist.", "\u201cI wasted my youth on you.\u201d\n\nThat is such a truly awful thing to say to your child. Not to mention her being blatantly racist towards you! She clearly has a lot of issues - some definitely courtesy of your father - but you are right that they are *not* your fault. She may or may not have had control around her relationship with your father or having children, but she\u2019s been raising you without him for the past 18 years, and if she wasted her youth on you, that\u2019s her problem.

Your mother and her whole side of the family are racist pricks.", "Just pretend she is dead. You don't have to love her. She's as bad as your father.", "Oh honey. Your mother is a racist bigot who is emotionally abusive to you. I\u2019m so sorry. NTA", "NTA\nMy mom would do similar things like call me lazy because I wasn't a 17 year old mom living on my own like she was. I would just say, \"Sorry for not being a teenage mom. I thought you'd be okay with that.\" All the while, I was working full time as a dishwasher paying for all of our groceries.\n\nI eventually realized that blaming everyone around her for what her life became was the only way she could live with it. I think it might be the same with your mom. They'd never be able to live with the fact that they fucked themselves over, so you end up being their scapegoat. It's sad, but that will never ever mean you were to blame, and you have every right to make that clear.", "Golly gosh I understand this! She\u2019s trying to make you feel guilty cause you hit the nail on the head. You can love her still and have her in your life, but you have to just take her as she is. She won\u2019t change. She doesn\u2019t want to. Know there is nothing wrong with you. If she decides she wants to treat you like this it\u2019s okay for you to remove her from your life. But YOU control your life \u263a\ufe0f You\u2019re an adult now. Tell her you want her in your life but you don\u2019t NEED her. You only get one Mother and she always will be.

And your brother \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA, it\u2019s tough being mixed race out here. Even the family you love can be racist. But your Mom sounds like she is genuinely bigoted. If she raised you, it\u2019s her who taught you how to act when things get heated. Making racist comments about your immutable characteristics is wrong, but sounds like you can be intentionally hurtful in turn.
