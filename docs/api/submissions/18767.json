A more compassionate response might be to see if there are any charitable organisations that might be able to help him clear the flat out and consider giving a longer deadline, so he\u2019s more able to achieve what needs to be done in that time frame. \n\nThis will help your gf see that you\u2019re approaching it from a place of empathy, while also achieving the outcome that you desire with the building.", "YTA mainly for the pet thing and your replies. 30 days is NOT enough time for someone to clear an apartment, especially when they have a mental illness like hoarding.

Yea, it's legal to change things when the lease is up but this isn't r/legaladvice and doing that will still be an asshole move.

I'd consider giving him a little more time than 30 days as long as he's clearly getting rid of stuff as fast as possible and letting him try to keep the cats if he can keep after them but I wasn't there so maybe it really was that bad and he deserves no mercy. But inheriting a building and then trying to change the rules on something as important as pets for everyone else is just wrong. \n\nI take it you aren't much of an animal person, and that's fine, but for many people pets are like family, and in especially tough situations they may be a substitute for the family someone no longer has. Taking that from them for no reason is wrong.", "NTA - for having him clean or get evicted. But the car thing. Are you even allowed to do that?

I would argue that Op is morally obligated to help those animals and if dad doesn't do something then he should call animal protection on him.

The rules may vary from state to state,  but I think you can only apply the new rule to new tenants. Any existing pets would have to be grandfathered in.

Did the whole building just suddenly become pet free?  What about the other pet owners in the building who are doing everything right?  Don't the renters (including Hoarder Dad) have rental agreements that would allow them to have pets, and maybe they even paid deposits in order to do so?

You think that someone who's committing animal cruelty has a right to keep those animals?

Also when you\u2019re dealing with a hoarder they can\u2019t even look after themselves (no judgement, it\u2019s a mental health issue) so to keep another SIX living creatures there for him to look after will only make it more likely he\u2019ll slip into old habits.

For true change, that will be needed.\n\nTBH, it sounds to me like OP is going to need to remove the poor man from the apartment in any case, as it is going to need serious remediation before it can safely be lived in at all.

His mental illness would cause him to hoard many things in boxes and that cat over time became seriously neglected and his litter box was so disgusting that the cat was literally living in filth. This beautiful kind rescue became vicious and untrustworthy. Scratching him and biting him. I couldn\u2019t rehome the cat because of his age and temperament as well as a kidney disease to contend with so I had to convince my brother to euthanize the cat. His cuts and bites were getting infected at times. Posing a health risk to him.
