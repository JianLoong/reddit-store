A more compassionate response might be to see if there are any charitable organisations that might be able to help him clear the flat out and consider giving a longer deadline, so he\u2019s more able to achieve what needs to be done in that time frame. \n\nThis will help your gf see that you\u2019re approaching it from a place of empathy, while also achieving the outcome that you desire with the building.", "YTA mainly for the pet thing and your replies. 30 days is NOT enough time for someone to clear an apartment, especially when they have a mental illness like hoarding.

Yea, it's legal to change things when the lease is up but this isn't r/legaladvice and doing that will still be an asshole move. They've been living there, with pets, without causing problems for years and now that you inherit the place it needs to change?\n\nHer dad? Yea pretty much you're in the right. I'd consider giving him a little more time than 30 days as long as he's clearly getting rid of stuff as fast as possible and letting him try to keep the cats if he can keep after them but I wasn't there so maybe it really was that bad and he deserves no mercy. But inheriting a building and then trying to change the rules on something as important as pets for everyone else is just wrong. \n\nI take it you aren't much of an animal person, and that's fine, but for many people pets are like family, and in especially tough situations they may be a substitute for the family someone no longer has. Taking that from them for no reason is wrong.", "NTA - for having him clean or get evicted. But the car thing. Are you even allowed to do that?

I would argue that Op is morally obligated to help those animals and if dad doesn't do something then he should call animal protection on him. Exactly because cats aren't objects and deserve to live in safe, clean environment. \n\nCat urine is hard to remove and it's possible the floors are damaged.
