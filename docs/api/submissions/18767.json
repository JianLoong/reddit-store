A more compassionate response might be to see if there are any charitable organisations that might be able to help him clear the flat out and consider giving a longer deadline, so he\u2019s more able to achieve what needs to be done in that time frame. \n\nThis will help your gf see that you\u2019re approaching it from a place of empathy, while also achieving the outcome that you desire with the building.", "YTA mainly for the pet thing and your replies. 30 days is NOT enough time for someone to clear an apartment, especially when they have a mental illness like hoarding.

I'd consider giving him a little more time than 30 days as long as he's clearly getting rid of stuff as fast as possible and letting him try to keep the cats if he can keep after them but I wasn't there so maybe it really was that bad and he deserves no mercy. But inheriting a building and then trying to change the rules on something as important as pets for everyone else is just wrong. \n\nI take it you aren't much of an animal person, and that's fine, but for many people pets are like family, and in especially tough situations they may be a substitute for the family someone no longer has.

Landlords can only enter without arrangement in case of emergency repairs etc.", "Nobody said he has to clean all of his tenants apartments. That\u2019s ridiculous and nobody was recommending he do that. But this isn\u2019t just any old random tenant, he has a familial relationship to this man through his girlfriend. He\u2019s absolutely not obligated to help as a landlord, but as the potential son-in-law (assuming it\u2019s a serious relationship) it\u2019s not unreasonable to suggest he help him. He still doesn\u2019t have to help if he doesn\u2019t want to, but there IS a difference between the random other tenants he doesn\u2019t know or have any relationship to vs. his girlfriend\u2019s father.", "Changing the pet policy makes you yta.", "If it was his own father would it be his problem? What level of interpersonal relationship does there have to be in order for there to be some sort of empathy and compassion shown? Or are you an \u201cevery man for themselves\u201d kind of person? Do you just kick all your friends and family to the curb when they\u2019re in need of help?", "If he wants a relationship with her, it's his problem. Clearly she doesn't matter to him.", "While I agree about your business and livelihood and the safety of the other tenants, I will say, be prepared to lose your girlfriend over this.\n\nShe and her dad are running on emotion, and hoarding is a mental state that will need a lot more than 30 days to even begin to help.\n\nI mean, yes, correct all the safety stuff, like now. But unless you're able to sit down with gf and dad and work out a way to get him help and come to an agreement, this is likely going to end with a breakup. Sorry to say.", "My mom once bought a cabin that belonged to a crazy cat lady, there were around 30 cats that had to be removed from the home. The walls and floor all had to be torn out and redone, even after tearing out all the flooring, the concrete or whatever was under had to be acid washed to get rid of the smell.", "Happened to me once or twice when the upstairs neighbors skipped out. Yeah, lady, only treat that apartment. We had raining roaches down the walls. Glad to be out.", "That will be next even if, or especially if OP is able to manage to have the apartment cleared out. He and the GF will claim deteriorating mental health as the cause, because he doesn't have his cats and crap with him.", "admittedly I'm biased because renting alone with my dog & it is super hard to find a place (we've had to move a few times) although I'm told it's looking better. but i am tired of shitty landlords. so i cant be objective here \ud83d\ude05", "Exactly! Just business, no need to treat anyone with common courtesy. But then they come crying to AITA...", "LEt's be realistic, the man has a mental disorder.  If he cleans up, it's going to be a disgusting mess again in 3 months.", "I was about to say about the walls. Went to look at an apartment once that was gorgeous with a beautiful garden. Perfect for me in every way, except while they had fully redone and repainted the unit, they clearly hadn't replaced the walls. The smell of tomcat spray was overwhelming.", "In most places, OP can't just suddenly change the rules for anyone who already has a signed lease. The lease agreement still carries over to the new owner of the building after it has been sold. \n\nOP can refuse to renew the lease or set new conditions for renewal, but they still have to honor the existing terms of the lease for whatever period is stated in the contract the tenant signed with the previous owner. If the previous lease agreement stated that pets were allowed, all tenants are allowed to have pets there until their original lease with the previous owner runs out.", "There's no way in hell that you can expect a hoarder that far gone to \"get it together\" enough to suddenly be able to take care of pets properly in 30 days. Therapy to get there can wasily take years (and in many cases it never happens)", "Agree 100%.  One of my kitties was from an animal hoarding situation, a home with more than 20 cats and dogs.  He still has issues with food even though I\u2019ve had him as my friend for 10 years (he\u2019s 14, I got him when he was about 4).  He has to see you put the fresh food in his dish or he won\u2019t eat it, I\u2019m sure he learned somewhere along the way that old food = not good, and of course he had stiff competition for food there too: it took almost a year of feeding him on a schedule for him to understand that food and water would be provided regularly for him.  He\u2019d attack trash and things like that for a while until he trusted us enough that food would always be available for him.  Now he knows his schedule so we\u2019ll we definitely hear about it if we are running a few minutes late!", "I live in an immaculately clean, quiet, pet friendly building. I walked bare foot through the grass lawn yesterday. No poop. Your experience is just that... It is not universal.", "That's not how inspections work.", "At the inspection, he will be violated, GIVEN TIME TO REMEDY IT, then he will be fined and violated again if he fails to remedy it. \n\nThe dude is doing an illegal unit inspection while pretending to be introducing himself because he's afraid of the inspection. He is a asshole landlord. He could let the inspection happen, then do all this LEGALLY.", "Sometimes being the boss means doing something that may hurt one person, in order to prevent the company from shutting down, thus helping many more. \n\nCEO job is looking at the big picture, and making decisions based on what is best for the many, and sometimes that means firing someone one. \n\nIt's the same here. OP has ensure the entire complex is livable. And one tenant is endangering that, and the health of the other residents in general. So OP has to look at the bigger picture and do what is best for everyone, and not just one person. He is putting the social and emotional well being of everyone else above that of his GF's father, who is responsible for this in the first place.", "All these questions would have been answered if OP hadn't acted like an asshole about it.", "Others, my landlord included. I've been told by quite a lot of people that my place has surprisingly no odor. I use no scents either. You can only smell my cat when he poops, but I open the windows and the smell is quickly gone.\n\nI've lost my sense of smell and taste for a few years (not covid related) and it's only partially back so I had to rely on people to tell me if I smell or if my place smells.", "Maybe he gave notice before he went around introducing himself.", "Kind of tangential, but a lot of what's allowed vs. not allowed as regards pets can be highly dependent on the history of the building/HOA/landlord/etc.\n\nA friend of mine bought a condo a few years ago and decided he wanted to get a goldfish as a pet. Let me emphasize, he wanted *one goldfish*. Not a huge fish tank, one little fish in a bowl on his kitchen counter.\n\nHe decided to be all legal and above-board about this, so he checked the bylaws. The bylaws allowed for residents to have as a pet: one cat. So, assuming that if a *cat* was allowed, a *goldfish* would be a total non-event, he submitted a formal request for an exception to the bylaws that would allow him to have one goldfish as a pet.\n\nTurns out, the HOA president was a petty tyrant who enjoyed power trips, so the president not only denied my friend's request to have a goldfish, he also started writing said friend up and fining him for every minor infraction he could manufacture. Not being the kind of guy to take this kind of thing lying down, my friend went to war, in the form of running for an open seat on the HOA board, which he won. \n\nOnce on the board, he had access to all kinds of records, and he pretty quickly figured out that the petty tyrant had been self-dealing (i.e. hiring himself for \"consulting services\" for the HOA and paying himself for those services) and straight-up embezzling funds from the HOA, all while blackmailing the rest of the board to keep them quiet. It was *wild*.", "No, if he had empathy he'd have discussed it with his girlfriend. He'd have given notice for a visit.\n\nLiterally nobody is suggesting giving the hoarder a pass, just dealing with the situation in less asshole-ish ways.", "I doubt it. If he gave notice, he'd just do a safety inspection and not pretend he was introducing himself when he was really investigating a cat piss smell.", "No reason it couldn't be both.", "Business isn\u2019t personal. I don\u2019t know what is so hard to understand. Those living conditions will affect his livelihood. Why is OP supposed to have compassion for everyone else, but no one is supposed to have compassion for OP and the situation this man has put himself and the other tenants in?

Hoarding in and of itself isn\u2019t illegal anywhere AFAIK. \n\nThere needs to be an enforceable clause in the lease pertaining to reporting problems and upkeep for any eviction to proceed.\n\nFailing that, OP needs to get local officials involved\u2014which could backfire on him if dad is deemed incompetent or the apartment condemned.\n\nYou can\u2019t just go \u201cew gross\u201d and assume the law is that cut and dry.", "No, he'd have framed it differently in his original post, and not omitted the fact that other tenants had complained about the smell.", "He gave the dad a 30 day cure or quit.

In this case his responsibility as a landlord doesn\u2019t necessarily conflict with his responsibility as a boyfriend. As a landlord he needs the apartment to be cleaned, as a boyfriend he can offer help to get the apartment cleaned. Girlfriend should certainly help as well, but as she\u2019s not the one making the post here, I can\u2019t tell her what she should do.", "Legally, sure. But it may cause headaches in the future.
