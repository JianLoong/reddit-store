Dog trainer here. The amount of clients that have had to come to me after being attacked by an off leash dog in a public place is insane. The amount of people I have personally had to yell at for letting their off leash dog rush either my dog or a client dog is even worse. Leash laws exist for a reason.", "NTA please continue to call people out on this. \n\nMy best friend is blind, she recently got a guide dog and she's always on high alert just walking past a park because of unleashed dogs. She probably wouldn't even go near this park, it's not worth the risk. Even if a dog has perfect recall, they can still be unpredictable, especially around other dogs. There are many stories of service dogs being attacked by unleashed dogs and are subsequently unable to continue being a service dog as a result, leaving their handler not only without their former independence and medical device, but also without their best friend and constant companion.\n\nAlso, it's really easy to find an extra long leash so your pup can still run around and enjoy themselves without endangering others.", "NTA I\u2019m a dog owner and it grinds my gears when people don\u2019t respect on lead rule\u2019s especially if they don\u2019t have good recall. \n\nYou have to respect that not everyone will like dogs or could have allergies etc. Plus you just never know if your dog could react badly to something/someone \n\nYou could be the AH if you\u2019re actively seeking out people who may just be chilling with the dog but if it\u2019s running around fair game to say something.", "If they want to unleash their dogs - there are lots of options for responsible dog owners like fenced backyard, dog's day care, public dog's parks with fenced areas for unleashed dogs. The problem is - people want only their dogs unleashed but not other people's dogs because no one can guarantee absolute safety and all other dogs being friendly, properly trained, neutered and up to date with vaccines. that's why they come to public parks for people.\n\nEdit: NTA and thanks for helping to keep public parks safe.", "As a dog owner, I believe that people who won't leash their dogs where it's legally required to do so are complete assholes.", "NTA, but I wouldn't get involved myself. I'd call the city and let them know that there are multiple people using the park as an offleash area. With a bit of luck, the city will see it as a great opportunity to make some money, send someone out there with a ticket book, and the problem will be solved ASAP.", "NTA, besides the clearly stated rules, here are some of my reasoning\n\n1) You don't know the dogs/dog owner, so you don't know how well trained/behaved the dog is and how aggresive they can be\n\n2) Alot of dog owners don't train their dog properly, I've read an article some time ago that stated that dog owners should put their dogs on leash when walking in the publicly available forrests, because dogs keep attacking deers and other wild life (because dogs are basically wolves who we as humans have tamed to a degree), and most of the time, the attacks wouldn't have happened, if the owners either trained their dogs or have put them on leash", "NTA. As a dog owner and huge dog lover, I\u2019m constantly doing the same. I don\u2019t know your loose dog, my dog doesn\u2019t know your loose dog. It\u2019s just not safe or responsible to have off leash dogs in leash required spaces.", "NTA. People like the ones you\u2019re calling out are the reason my parents had to stop walking our dog. She got attacked WAY too many times by off leash dogs. I hate people that let their dogs wander off leash. I can guarantee you those dogs are not well behaved enough for that. They never are.", "NTA. As a dog owner, I can specifically remember one time I had to practically throw my dog(a 50lb lab) behind me to protect her from an unleashed dog. Dogs are leashed for everyone\u2019s safety, including the owners of the dog, non-dog-owning people in the park, and the dog itself. Just like the \u201cpick up your dog\u2019s shit\u201d, \u201cput your dog on the leash you\u2019re holding in your hands\u201d is definitely something that needs to be normalized", "NTA - I am in the same boat with having been chased and almost attacked by dogs when I was a kid. So whenever I see a loose dog, I instantly get frightened. I wish dog owners would follow the leash law because not just protecting people from getting accidentally bit, but you\u2019re also protecting your dog. You just never know when the dog decides to run off, the dog could get hurt or get run over by a car, so I don\u2019t know why dog owners put their dogs at risk like this!", "NTA.  I am a dog owner and lover, and the truth is you never 100% know what your dog will do in every situation.  They should be leashed in public, unless they are in a dog park where they are allowed to be free.", "Nta. The dog owners are being irresponsible.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

There are many good reasons for this rule.", "nta, there is signs posted and no dog should be running loose where kids/people are. you never know what could happen. i have a 10 year old dachshund and he is leashed everywhere we go.", "NTA. People can be so entitled about their dogs. It is best for the safety of EVERYONE to follow leash rules, and people seem to forget that also includes the safety of the dog itself. It's like, if a small yappy dog off-leash approaches a bigger, more aggressive dog ON-leash and the smaller dog gets injured as a result, the blame will still be pushed onto the owner of the leashed dog, even though they did their due diligence to maintain control over their dog, and now everyone is suffering.\n\n\nI love all creatures, but so many dogs become unruly & badly behaved because their owners treat them like a weird \"plush toy/human child\" combo that must be coddled & free from consequence. \"Oh I feed him table scraps because he likes it, I let him free-roam in public because he likes it...\" Yeah, and I'll bet he REALLY likes it when he gets health problems from all the grease & salt you feed him, and would REALLY like it if accidents happened while he was off-leash, leading to him getting run over by a car or kicked by a person in self-defence.\n\n\nI don't care how \"small\" or \"friendly\" your dog is - that doesn't change the fact that it is an animal with the capacity to do harm. Off-leash dogs are responsible for killing huge amounts of small wildlife. Rare ground-nesting birds are a huge target.\n\n\nTrain your dogs. Leash your dogs. Contain them properly when driving, both so they don't interfere with your capacity to control the vehicle, and so they are properly restrained in the event of a crash, and prevented from launching themselves out a window. \"Oh but he LIKES to sit in the front seat!\" Okay, will you LIKE getting in a car accident when Fido lunges at a bug on your windshield? No? Me neither!", "Nope. NTA. Those rules exist for a reason.", "NTA at all. \n\ndog leashes protect everyone around the dog, but also the dog itself. they make long leads- i keep my rescue dog on a long lead (50\u2019) and immediately tighten it up when i can see people around me. she gets all the fun of being able to sniff, wander, and run- but i *always* have a way to reel her in. there\u2019s no reason to have an off leash dog in a park that does not allow it.", "My newfie has perfect recall every time, I still leash him unless we are training somewhere predetermined. The only time we use his off leash training is at the lake for water rescue training, or at my parents house. We don't go to dog parks, we have the exact same walking route every time because we know all the dogs on the route. I keep mace on me when walking my dogs and I keep the big guy on a 12in traffic lead so I can protect him if a strange dog approaches off leash... he has been attacked by other dogs just because of his size, multiple times. I don't hesitate to lecture the shit out of anyone with a loose dog. Messing with my dogs safety isn't something I tolerate.", "Someone else mentioned something about unleashed dogs attacking leashed dogs. I'm guessing this is a common issue when you have 1 leashed and 1 unleashed? Is it more likely to happen in that scenario than if they were both unleashed? I'm just asking out of curiosity it's not really pertinent to the original discussion.\n\nAlso, thanks for your input!", "I hadn't even considered the dangers to other dogs... well said.", "I've only said this to people that I've crossed paths with.

Dogs don\u2019t typically greet head on and a head on greeting can often indicate aggressive intent. Two off leash dogs greeting will typically circle each other, allowing for free movement, proper sniffing, and easily able to get more space if they want it. Adding in the fact that the off leash dog is often running straight at them without any warning, the on leash dog is left feeling shocked, nervous, and potentially attacked which can lead to defensive behavior. Anecdotally, the folks I see with off leash dogs are lacking control over them entirely, which contributes to the tension between the dogs (one dog is controlled and the other is free to be as wacky as they want and lacks boundaries). \n\nOne last add on: many of us (myself included) are working with our dogs on specific things. Reactivity is what I work with the most in my dog training. Ideally, I can take these dogs to public places when they\u2019re ready and do training there. Unfortunately, someone with an off leash dog can ruin my whole training session, or worse, set the dog I\u2019m working with back by months and months of effort. Seeing my client in tears because we got rushed at a public park is devastating for me. You calling these people out HELPS those of us working with our dogs!", "Maybe you could point out that if something happens ( a child getting bitten) that they are risking their dogs life. It may help others realize that they are quite literally risking having their dog put down and legal action taken against them", "I think you'd be right if the situation was different, like if you were living next to someone and it was one neighbour doing it, then a conversation might work well, don't think it's as needed if you have 20 different people doing it on different days at a park", "Well thank you for the information, this is stuff I didn't know and would've never considered. Potentially not even after I get my own dog one day.\n\nThanks for taking the time to reply and good luck with your future training sessions!", "I just started the process to train my dogs to walk on a treadmill because there are an insane amount of people in my neighborhood who either walk their dogs off leash or leave them in unfenced yards unrestrained, it's absolutely absurd*. I only let them out to go potty because of it and they're restless. Life goal is to move to a rural area and build a solid fence so my pups can be dogs without the stress of others \ud83d\ude2d", "Unfortunately, in my experience, you can tell these people a million times and they simply don\u2019t care. The only way I\u2019ve seen change is having police or animal control show up.", "Ah, I see your point. It is definitely an ongoing issue."]}
