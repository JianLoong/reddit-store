He has a childhood best friend (28M) who's gonna be his best man. Needless to say they're very close to each other. Recently my fiance told me how a couple of years ago his best friend got drunk and confessed his love to him. My fiance was taken aback cause he only ever dated (and I think still dates) women. And according to my fiance he just ignored his confession afterwards and they never talk about it in order to not make their friendship awkward. To this my fiance isn't sure if his best friend even remembers that confession. \n\nI obviously got very uneasy hearing this, especially cause they never talk it out so he could very well still be in love with him (I think his best friend is still single atm or not in a serious relationship at least). My fiance said that there's no reason to worry cause he never brought up his feelings again, which may have not even have been serious to begin with, but considering they've been best friends since middle school I seriously doubt it. I honestly feared his best man might try to ruin my wedding out of jealousy, so I sent him a private message requesting him to withdraw his position as my fiance's best man and not come to our wedding if possible as his presence made me uncomfortable. Well, my fiance found out about it and now he's furious with me. He told me I was incredibly out line for trying to disinvite his best man and friend of almost 2 decades behind his back, but I told him that I only did it cause I don't someone who was in love with him and probably still is to be at our wedding and potentially sabotage. We went back and forth on this till I told him that he has to choose between me and his best friend, but he told me that I'm incredibly childish one it's too early to already be acting like a bridezilla and then left to his mother's place and 2 days later still haven't come back or tried to contact me.\n\nAITA ?", "created_utc": 1674431808, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10iyap8/aita_for_attempting_to_disinvite_my_fiances_best/", "score": 616, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I know Reddit\u2019s always saying it but a little therapy couldn\u2019t hurt. You went about this all wrong and dealt with the wrong person entirely.\n\nYour problem wasn\u2019t the best man but your insecurities about what he felt for your fianc\u00e9. This was a \u201cyou\u201d problem that also involved your relationship. The one you should have gone to was your fianc\u00e9. You should have told him your fears and together you should have found a solution. Instead you showed your fianc\u00e9 that you don\u2019t trust him, his judgment or his ability to handle conflict. So instead you went outside of your relationship to attack someone that in your jealousy you felt threatened by. When that didn\u2019t work you issued an angry ultimatum. \n\nThat isn\u2019t how you fix your own insecurities or handle conflicts in a relationship. You need to learn that before you marry anyone.", "YTA, bridezilla.", "I\u2019m not even sure why anyone would want to marry you as you\u2019re immature af.
