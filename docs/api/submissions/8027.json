He has a childhood best friend (28M) who's gonna be his best man. Needless to say they're very close to each other. Recently my fiance told me how a couple of years ago his best friend got drunk and confessed his love to him. My fiance was taken aback cause he only ever dated (and I think still dates) women. And according to my fiance he just ignored his confession afterwards and they never talk about it in order to not make their friendship awkward. To this my fiance isn't sure if his best friend even remembers that confession. \n\nI obviously got very uneasy hearing this, especially cause they never talk it out so he could very well still be in love with him (I think his best friend is still single atm or not in a serious relationship at least). My fiance said that there's no reason to worry cause he never brought up his feelings again, which may have not even have been serious to begin with, but considering they've been best friends since middle school I seriously doubt it. I honestly feared his best man might try to ruin my wedding out of jealousy, so I sent him a private message requesting him to withdraw his position as my fiance's best man and not come to our wedding if possible as his presence made me uncomfortable. Well, my fiance found out about it and now he's furious with me. He told me I was incredibly out line for trying to disinvite his best man and friend of almost 2 decades behind his back, but I told him that I only did it cause I don't someone who was in love with him and probably still is to be at our wedding and potentially sabotage. We went back and forth on this till I told him that he has to choose between me and his best friend, but he told me that I'm incredibly childish one it's too early to already be acting like a bridezilla and then left to his mother's place and 2 days later still haven't come back or tried to contact me.\n\nAITA ?", "created_utc": 1674431808, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10iyap8/aita_for_attempting_to_disinvite_my_fiances_best/", "score": 217, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This was a \u201cyou\u201d problem that also involved your relationship. The one you should have gone to was your fianc\u00e9. You should have told him your fears and together you should have found a solution. Instead you showed your fianc\u00e9 that you don\u2019t trust him, his judgment or his ability to handle conflict. So instead you went outside of your relationship to attack someone that in your jealousy you felt threatened by. When that didn\u2019t work you issued an angry ultimatum. \n\nThat isn\u2019t how you fix your own insecurities or handle conflicts in a relationship. You need to learn that before you marry anyone.", "YTA, bridezilla.", "I\u2019m not even sure why anyone would want to marry you as you\u2019re immature af.

It\u2019s a matter of respect for the relationship. I don\u2019t want anyone who\u2019s ever professed their love for my SO at my wedding. Period.

I love you as a best friend and nothing more.\u201d is a good boundary.", "And make some cheesy signs", "How anyone finds that cute or sweet is insane to me. It\u2019s creepy, he\u2019s a *crap* friend and Best Man, and could quite possibly ruin his best friend\u2019s new marriage.", "I would, too.", "Haha how does she not see that", "lol fr this woman's logic is wild", "Hahaha this is the most factual statement here. Maybe OP is worried best man will jump in at the last minute and marry the groom", "Oh, I think the fianc\u00e9 already ended it.", "Exactly! At any given moment someone could be secretly in love with any of us!\n\nOP, there could be literally dozens of people at your wedding who are in love with your fianc\u00e9. In fact, I'm willing to bet there is at LEAST a few people there who have kissed him. Maybe even slept with him. \n\nYou don't know about them, do you?", "Nope, still wouldn't get it", "Not if it had been YEARS before, was a drunken confession and never came up again. \n\nIf the friend had just told him about his feelings and had said it as \u201cDon\u2019t marry OP, I love you\u201d than yeah, don\u2019t invite him.", "It's not an issue because the fiance WAS marrying her.", "A drunken mind also speaks a sober heart, you know ? I doubt that saying is for nothing.", "And going behind your partners back is respect to you? Interesting", "This happened before he met fianc\u00e9", "Pre-fiance.", "How did he not see it ?", "Because causing a scene and declaring her love for the bride/groom is something she would do.

Were you even dating him when confession happened?", "I can assure you it does not, when I drank I would do so many stupid ass things that sober me would never dream of doing. And that\u2019s why I don\u2019t drink anymore", "one time i got drunk and set the home page on all my devices to the wikipedia page for denim jeans. \n\nanother time my girlfriend at the time got drunk and forgot she had siblings. literally was trying to tell a story about her sister with her drunk as sin, spitting as she spoke, \"im an only child!\" she has three blood siblings and three step siblings. \n\nso no, i don't think a drunken mind speaks a sober heart. i don't even wear jeans!", "Whoever said that didn't spend enough time around drunk people.", "Lol I dk about that, I made up a lot of shit when I was drunk. And now I am sober because drunk me is a trashy nightmare", "Bros probs been walking on eggshells for the longest.  This is his way out.  Blessing in disguise", "Touch\u00e9.  Great answer", "The confession happened before me and my fiance started dating. And while he didn't directly sabotage our relationship, he always wanted to hang out with my fiance without me around, which now does make me a bit suspicious about him.", "Exactly if a drunken fried of op confessed his love for her no one would be upset", ">he always wanted to hang out with my fiance without me around\n\nCause they're friends?", "I think you\u2019re the suspicious one. Your boyfriends friends don\u2019t have to hang out or be friends with you", "You\u2019re looking for reasons to be upset. You failed to keep your own personal insecurities in check and ended up self sabotaging your own relationship as a result.

You\u2019ve also acknowledged that this proclamation of love occurred before y\u2019all were together. You\u2019re creating drama where there is none to be had.\n\nCam\u2019t imagine why the best friend is always wanting to hang out with your fianc\u00e9 alone\u2026", "So one half of a married/dating couple can't hang out with their friends without the other half always tagging along? Do you always bring your fiance everytime you hang out with your friends? Or is he hanging out with his friends and you hanging out with your any different because REASONS?", "You do know people get over people, right? I had a good friend I had feelings for. Told him - sober - when he was single. He gently told me he cares about me as a friend but didn\u2019t feel that way. I clarified that I was more than happy to stay friend and we did. It was awkward the next few times I saw him but by the time he got married years later, I was more than happy for him! I had moved on, dated some people, it was good. I was thrilled really. We\u2019re not as close anymore as he moved away for work but I never would have sabotaged his wedding.", "you allowed your overly jealous and paranoid thinking get in the way of your relationship, it was no one else but YOU who did this. \n\nYOU ruined your wedding. \n\nYOU ruined your relationship and trust with your (ex) fiance.\n\nYOU are now going to have to suffer the consequences. \n\nyou decided to go behind your once SOON-TO-BE-HUSBANDS back, and tried to make his BEST FRIEND stand down from being a groomsmen.

Handle his secrets with grace, and \nB. Discuss issues with him before reacting out of irrational emotion.\n\nYou don't need to worry about his best friend sabotaging your wedding, anymore. With your lack of insight to how incredibly selfish and controlling your actions were and the way you continue to try to justify your behavior, I'm betting there isn't going to be a wedding to sabotage.
