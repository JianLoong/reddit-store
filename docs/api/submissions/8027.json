He has a childhood best friend (28M) who's gonna be his best man. Needless to say they're very close to each other. Recently my fiance told me how a couple of years ago his best friend got drunk and confessed his love to him. My fiance was taken aback cause he only ever dated (and I think still dates) women. And according to my fiance he just ignored his confession afterwards and they never talk about it in order to not make their friendship awkward. To this my fiance isn't sure if his best friend even remembers that confession. \n\nI obviously got very uneasy hearing this, especially cause they never talk it out so he could very well still be in love with him (I think his best friend is still single atm or not in a serious relationship at least). My fiance said that there's no reason to worry cause he never brought up his feelings again, which may have not even have been serious to begin with, but considering they've been best friends since middle school I seriously doubt it. I honestly feared his best man might try to ruin my wedding out of jealousy, so I sent him a private message requesting him to withdraw his position as my fiance's best man and not come to our wedding if possible as his presence made me uncomfortable. Well, my fiance found out about it and now he's furious with me. He told me I was incredibly out line for trying to disinvite his best man and friend of almost 2 decades behind his back, but I told him that I only did it cause I don't someone who was in love with him and probably still is to be at our wedding and potentially sabotage. We went back and forth on this till I told him that he has to choose between me and his best friend, but he told me that I'm incredibly childish one it's too early to already be acting like a bridezilla and then left to his mother's place and 2 days later still haven't come back or tried to contact me.\n\nAITA ?", "created_utc": 1674431808, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10iyap8/aita_for_attempting_to_disinvite_my_fiances_best/", "score": 1402, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This was a \u201cyou\u201d problem that also involved your relationship. The one you should have gone to was your fianc\u00e9. You should have told him your fears and together you should have found a solution. Instead you showed your fianc\u00e9 that you don\u2019t trust him, his judgment or his ability to handle conflict. So instead you went outside of your relationship to attack someone that in your jealousy you felt threatened by. When that didn\u2019t work you issued an angry ultimatum. \n\nThat isn\u2019t how you fix your own insecurities or handle conflicts in a relationship. You need to learn that before you marry anyone.", "YTA, bridezilla.", "I\u2019m not even sure why anyone would want to marry you as you\u2019re immature af.

You way overstepped, and that ship has probably already sailed and sunk. YTA", "YTA. You went behind his back and tried to disinvite his friend of 20 years. What did you think would happen? Where\u2019s the evidence that he was going to sabotage the wedding? By this point, if he had wanted to he probably would\u2019ve tried to break you guys up by now. Maybe he\u2019s such a good friend that despite the feelings for your fianc\u00e9, he was happier to see his best friend marry the love of his life than try to be with him.", "YTA that is honestly so crazy and I don't understand how this kind of unfounded toxic jealousy became so normalized in our culture all of a sudden.", "YTA\nFirst of all is really presumptuous of you to assume that the best friend still has feelings for bf. Second of all, if he in fact did, it would be the bf's problem to deal with and to talk out with the best friend. Third of all, it is not just your wedding, it is also the bf's wedding and you should not be making such decisions without consulting, much less considering your bf. This is a violation of boundaries, trust, and respect for both your bf and the best friend.", "His best man didn\u2019t sabotage your wedding, you did. Good luck with that. YTA.", "1) Well If you truly felt like the best friend of over 20 years was going to sabotage your wedding you should have talked to your fiance. How is it though that you came to that conclusion? Has he been intrusive or causing problems in your relationship? If this admission from your fiance made you uneasy why did you not sit down and have a serious heart-to-heart with him? \n\n2) I read somewhere, wasn't sure if it was in one of the replies and comments or if it was in your original post, but I read somewhere that the friend wanted your fiance to hang out sometimes without you. That in and of itself that's not a horrible request. My husband has friends that he goes and hangs out with and I don't go with them. Not an issue at all. I think the issue here is that now you know that the friend once expressed an interest, it has you 2nd guessing any time they spend together especially if you're not around. How is this a problem though if your fiance is heterosexual and didn't give any indication otherwise or that he would be interested in reciprocating? Or that he is the kind of man to cheat on you?\n\n3) Also, The fact that you were sneaky about it by messaging the friend to uninvite himself ... Honestly don't know how you didn't think that was going to come back and blow up in your face. \n\n4) Don't get me wrong I can understand the admission would make you uneasy but that would go back to a trust issue with your fiance. I mean going through day-to-day life there will be many people that express an interest in him and in you. Are you going to ban him from having contact with anyone else in the world? \n\n5) And another thing..... A little off your something that came to mind....I know many heterosexual males, my husband included, that if a friend told them they were gay and interested in them, that would end the friendship. Not because they were gay but because they were gay and interested.\n\n6) And I feel like the friend very much knows he confessed and did it while he was drunk for liquid courage and to see what happened after he made his admission. When everyone was all sobered up and the fiance didn't come back and say Hey dude what the h*** or Hey now that you've admitted you have feelings for me I admit I'm curious so how about we try it?  When the friend didn't get that reaction he has been playing dumb ever since So I don't buy that the friend doesn't remember saying that to the fiance.\n\n7) One final point here.... if this admission makes you uncomfortable for whatever reason, You should have sat down and talked to him and try to come to a reasonable compromise but to try and make him choose, how do you have the audacity to tell him to choose between a friend he has had of over 20 years and yourself? I am having trouble Trying to find your side or point of view in this instance. Jealousy is a sign of insecurity and if he tried to give you an ultimatum about choosing between him and one of your friends behind an insecurity issue what would you say? It may be different if it was a female friend because I have always been of the mindset that married people shouldn't hang out with single people because that opens the door to things that a door should never be opened on. So again if it was a female friend, after you became his wife, you would have the right to set some boundaries..... But this here you seriously over step so yes YTA.", "YTA.

You could have tried talking about it with your fianc\u00e9, but doing this behind his back was a terrible move.", "Has this man given any indication that he is spiteful or vengefull? \nNo?

If he meant it romantically rather than just a best friend/brotherly love, then I can kind of understand your discomfort. I wouldn't be 100% comfortable having someone around if I knew they had feelings for my s/o either, but that's speaking from an experience I've had in the past.\n\nI don't think YTA for being uncomfortable, however, I will say YTA for how you handled it.\n\nYou jumped to the conclusion that he could sabotage the wedding. You have no proof that he would do that, just your own paranoia.

That would be one of my concerns as the groom.\n\nMore to the point, why are you here asking? You KNEW you were TA. That's why you did it behind your fiance's back. \n\nSomething is making you feel some way that made you totally disregard your fianc\u00e9's feelings, felt entitled to possibly out someone (just *no*) and cause major drama around your wedding.

It is also completely normal that he would still be very good friends with his friends.\n\nAlso, for some context, I wonder if his friend might love him in a platonic way or did his friend try to kiss him or something?", "I don't get how your fianc\u00e9 had a conversation with you about this, but you couldn't talk back to him to explain about your paranoia about his best man.

And not just a normal AH, but an insecure, overthinking AH who went behind her fianc\u00e9's back rather than acting like an adult who is to be married and having a discussion with your selected life partner.\n\nYou may have ruined your wedding yourself before it ever began and only have yourself to blame for it.

I think the answer to all of that is no because you didn\u2019t say anything about that. So you have no reason to not trust him. \nBut the big thing for me, it doesn\u2019t matter if you don\u2019t trust him. You trust your partner to make his own choices.

Incredibly short sighted!", "I'll be honest, NTA\n\nBut for the simple fact that I would feel super uncomfortable, having someone who at some point was in love with whom I am marrying\n\nThat's why I have never dated someone who is \"friends of his ex\" It is literally a time bomb 8/10 times there is still tension or feelings.\n\n(in this case it's not an ex, but you get the point that they're friends, there's a certain level of emotional relationship and I'd feel uncomfortable even if it's one-way)\n\nBut YTA for going behind your fianc\u00e9's back, being honest you should have been tougher with him, about why everything makes you uncomfortable, and talk about it,The 2 are going to be a couple, there is no such thing as \"going behind the back and I get what I want\" You both are adults you can talk.", "No it means that he is reflecting if he should marry a manipulative person that goes behind his back when he clearly communicate", "He didn't let a simple confession ruin the closest friendship he has, and OP went behind his back. You know it's possible for people to be close friends in a situation like this right? Based off the information that we have, OP's fiance has no feelings for his best friend, plain and simple, otherwise he wouldn't be engaged to OP.", "You also need two \"yeses\" before uninviting someone who was \\*already\\* invited to your wedding. She went behind her fiance back because of her own paranoia. OP is YTA.\n\nEdit: Changed a word", "Okay that is already being immature", ">Getting married\n\nNot anymore", "Wanna bet the best friend just got drunk and told his best friend he loved him (in a platonic way) and OP\u2019s fianc\u00e9 was like, \u201clol gay\u201d?", "The funny thing is, she basically guaranteed that they would have to talk about it now. Had she just followed her fianc\u00e9s lead, it probably never would\u2019ve come up again.", "But did she try to sabotage the doctor's wedding?", "I was being sarcastic but ok", "No\u2026 think about it. He knows his friend well and is worried he may fall for a jealous, possessive bridezilla. So he makes up a fake confession of love, as a test for a future bride. It\u2019s actually brillant!\n\n/s.", "Wives come and go. BF are best friends forever", "We need an update from OP! So curious to see if we're right haha", "You\u2019re assuming they\u2019re both straight.  Lots of men live in the closet these days.  Just sayin\u2019.", "Well, if you think about it, he never INTENDED for Keira to find out about his crush on her. \n\nShe bullied him into giving her the tape, he resisted but then had to concede. \n\nThen when she clicked, he left the room.  He did not try to have sex with her, kiss her, declare his love\u2026 nothing.\n\nThen he later did the doorstep carol thing as a way to clear his conscience and let her go. It was a way for him to move on, not an attempt to seduce her or force her into anything.\n\nI don\u2019t think he deserves to be painted as a monster because he was in love with his friend\u2019s wife\u2026 he never wanted to tell her!\n\nI bet lots of people in the world have a crush on a friend\u2019s partner, but do not try to seduce them or encourage them to cheat! They just\u2026 suffer in silence until they let go and move on. \n\nUsually not as\u2026 overtly as in Love Actually, but if you never know that someone\u2019s in love with your partner, then how could they be a monster for being in love with your partner? \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I mean, so much of Love Actually is incredibly creepy and awful, the only part that actually is sweet to me is the part with Bill Nighy.   MAYBE the part with Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson but really only because the two of them are so good.  EVERY other vignette is ridiculous if not offensive:\n\n1. Man falling in love with woman who cleans up after him and doesn't speak  -- mute bang-maid, basically\n2. Boy who isn't in puberty yet being encouraged by his father to act out sexually to a teenage girl\n3. HAHAHAHA you see it is the PRIME MINISTER but she is of a LOWER CLASS and also she is PLUMP, oh, how funny her little lower class family is ha ha ha \n4. Yes, the guy stalking Kiera Knightly, unbearable\n5. HA HA HA AMERICAN GIRLS ARE EASY, stupid Americans\n6. Porn star stand ins how super super funny", "Maybe the bestfreind is bi? But as far as we can tell from this post. Ops ex-fiance is straight", "What happened to Eve?? I\u2019m hella curious now \ud83d\ude31"]}
