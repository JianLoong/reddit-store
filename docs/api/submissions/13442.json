That is a grown up thing to do.  \n\nIt sounds like your girlfriend is worried that you have more feeling for your nurse friend than her, and unfortunately you guys are at an age that most relationships will not last much longer.

Also, a cheap boquet would have been too tacky. What other gift would have been appropriate? \n\nI thought it was a good choice and a fitting gift for someone who put in the effort to give you in a better position for your future.

You want to keep giving her flowers on multiple occasions hence regular as quantity over quality. Your GF is a mild AH for complaining about such a gift but think she wants to feel she is special.

Luckily for me, my wife went through more intense rotations than me and also gets it.\nYes, your g/f is being a little childish, however if you truly take a step back and look at it from her point of view, I'm sure you can see her POV if you really wanted to. You're whataboutisms that are going on with all of your responses show me that you too have some growing up to do yet, but you're both still young with learning to do, hence my ruling on the matter.\n\nAn apology and a nice surprise can go a long way here (might I suggest NOT going with the \"normal flowers,\" maybe make a special dinner or something that shows effort on your part).", "NTA and your girlfriend sounds jealous and childish.", "NTA.

And yur girlftiend needs to be less insecure.", "I\u2019m going to say NTA because it\u2019s a nice thing you did. but the fact that you spent so much on this lady and buy cheap for your girlfriend is wrong.

So, it was too expensive for your girlfriend but not your mentor?", "[deleted]", "ESH. getting that as a gift for your mentor wasn\u2019t wrong, but you went about giving the gift to the teacher wrong by doing it in view of your gf like that. i sense there\u2019s something else going on in your relationship with your gf as to why she would react so strongly as to actually cry about it. but idk. assuming you already explained to gf the significance of this mentor and that it\u2019s a one-time appreciation gift.. she should be understanding of it even though i get how it could see a little off at first. maybe she has other things going on in her life making her emotional? go on a walk and talk with her. sounds like there\u2019s a misunderstanding somewhere in there or something else going on that\u2019s festering", "The fact that your GF never gets you flowers *even though you have asked!!* and gets pissy about a one-time, fully justified gift of an expensive bouquet suggests (best case scenario) that she might have some sexist ideas about flower giving (only dudes give flowers and only to special women in their lives).\n\nYou are NTA.\n\nI will say that you could have told her you were planning to do this. \"I'm so thankful to X and I'm going to pick this up for her\" would include GF in your life in a meaningful way. The fact that she literally didn't know who they were for is so weird.", "YTA for buying flowers for another woman in front of your girlfriend.", "NAH. Flowers are apparently your thing--doesn't seem like any intentional romantic gesture, but now that you've seen your gf's reaction, Y WB TA if you have a similar question for us in the future without having learned from all this. Your gf may feel upset and a little jealous over you saving up to get the better flowers (even though one-timer for a mentor) for a young woman--and that is a usual, valid human reaction. Somewhat interesting that you mention your gf's father being a key person (i.e., the literal driver), and not his reaction, which I will assume was not worth noting.", "I know right?

But the insecurity is coming from somewhere. It's best to get to the root of it and really listen to where her feelings are coming from when you talk it out, even though you're NTA.\n\nMaybe plan to take her out to a nice dinner, or plan a date night around something that really makes her feel special. Maybe a weekend vacation somewhere if you can swing it? Good luck!", "she feels devalued.\n\nI agree thst this nurse has done a  lot for you and it was nice to celebrate her.\n\nHowever....your gf is hurt because you never cared or respected her enough to get her something equally special.\n\nSo, I am going NAH ...

Don\u2019t ask the internet for advice if you\u2019re not willing to be open to their response.\n\nFlowers have a romantic connotation. It\u2019s a little odd to give flowers to someone in a professional setting. In fact I\u2019m willing to bet any co workers in that setting that heard about you giving your mentor flowers would have assumed you had a crush on her. \n\nNot saying you do\u2026 just saying the giving of flowers is generally considered to be a romantic gesture.", "This nurse played a critical role in his academic pursuits; a life changing goal. \n\nOP is in high school.

I only have limited money from my part time job, I had to plan for this. If I wanted to get my girlfriend fancy flowers I would probably have to skip giving her a gift on a different occasion which would upset her more.", "I wasn't even there and assumed he had a bit of a crush.", "agree...which is why she feels devalued. If he has limited cash, he valued the nurse over her. He pre ordered and spent way more... more than he has ever done for gf.\n\nIf he doesn't have limited cash...he showed he wasn't willing to put in the same effort. \n\nAlso, if you read his other comments he seemed to do it for revenge and deliberately hurt her because she gave a painting to her teaching assistant. \n\nHe did this in front of her...again, seems for no reason other than hurting her. \n\nI originally said NAH but the more he wrote the more it was he is def YTA.", "Did she buy another man flowers in front of you and give them to him?\n\n You are trying to change the subject....this is not about her getting you flowers, it is about what you did. \n\nStop muddying the waters and accept that you messed this up. \n\nIf you plan to end it with her, just do it. But don't try and make her the bad guy.", "Does she give you things?", "Again why do you want flowers so badly? I don\u2019t get your desire for flowers\u2026", "This isn't about what your gf does or doesn't do.  \nIt's about you doing for a different woman what you won't do for your gf.", "I\u2019m curious: Do you really want your gf to give you flowers?", "She made a dedicated painting for her assistant art teacher (a 22 year old undergrad) and made me drop it off for him a few months ago. So by your logic, that means she messed up, right?", "Why is the girlfriend allowed to desire flowers but he is not? Is it because he\u2019s, gasp, a guy? And men aren\u2019t allowed to want pretty flowers?", "I feel like it\u2019s relevant in context because my girlfriend seems to have a hypocritical expectation for me.", "lol so this you see as revenge? \n\n I don't know the circumstances behind the painting.\n\nAgain, muddying the waters... you made this post about you giving the flowers. \n\nDo you even like your gf?", "It sounds to me like she messed up in that case, yes. Having you deliver it to him strikes me as especially weird, kinda like a power play.\n\nIt kinda sounds like maybe you did this to get back at her for that instance...\n\nIn any case, giving flowers (even expensive ones) to your mentor was nice and doesn't make you an AH.\n\nSeparately, maybe it's time to examine your relationship with your gf.", "Of course. I just don\u2019t believe OP wants flowers. I think he\u2019s looking for reasons to play the victim and I was attempting to call his bluff", "[deleted]", "Ahhh the truth comes out!! This whole story is a revenge served cold plot", "It\u2019s weird to get her flowers? Jesus, does every relationship, even an academic mentorship, automatically become sexually charged just because it has a man and a woman?", "[deleted]", "\u2026you say no, but your reply above literally says the exact opposite.\n\n\u201cIs it still weird to get another woman (that you\u2019re not related to) flowers? Yep.\u201d", "She\u2019d be fine with it if she\u2019s not insecure.", "NTA. The nurse opened many career doors for you. Would your GF be jealous if you had gotten your mentor chocolates instead? It\u2019s an appreciation gift. My husband recently started a new position at his company. In a few weeks, he is taking the 4 people he used to supervise out for lunch on his own dime. Two are women. Do I care? No, because it\u2019s a thank you lunch and I\u2019m not insecure. Is your GF young too? It could be her immaturity coming through as well. Good luck in your career!", "NAH. Is your GF pursuing higher education as well? Same college?Just thinking that the flowers could be triggering because they are a tangible symbol of upcoming big life changes that will change/end the relationship.", "NTA \n\nShe doesnt buy you flowers even though you would like them and you do. She shouldnt be feeling devalued here", "This is a clear NTA imo and it\u2019s really hard for me to see how OP messed anything up. The flowers for his mentor served as a sincere thank you for all of the time, effort, and guidance that she invested in him over the years \u2014 well deserved since it sounds like she literally played a big part in OP\u2019s acceptance into such a prestigious university program by connecting him to legitimate and relevant opportunities in the field as a high school student. Realistically, it\u2019s likely also a bit of a parting gift. I had mentors in high school and university who I adored but whose role in my life diminished as I transitioned into new stages of life. \n\nOn top of that, it was a one-time gift. One nice bouquet in exchange for years of incredibly valuable support vs. GF who (from what OP has said) has received flowers and other gifts somewhat regularly. This really doesn\u2019t seem like a respect issue, so much as greed and entitlement from GF who apparently doesn\u2019t understand why OP may want to express his gratitude for someone who went above and beyond when they really didn\u2019t have to."]}
