{"id": 9503, "submission_id": "10xjwyy", "title": "AITA for not returning a family's dog?", "selftext": "OK.  So.\n\nBack in November I was walking my dog around my neighborhood.  I saw a woman putting up a sign on a street corner stop sign.  She had a black and white dog with her.  My dog ran up to say 'hello' and the woman and I got to talking.  The black and white dog had been found a few days earlier, and she had been spending the day putting up 'found dog' signs.  During our talk, she mentioned that she couldn't really keep the dog on account of having a large German shepherd at home and the rambunctiousness was a bit much.  The black and white dog and my little guy were getting along famously, so I told her that I'd be happy to foster the dog until the owners were found.  During this whole conversation we continued walking around the neighborhood, putting up the rest of her 'found dog' signs.  She had also posted the animal on PawBoost and somewhere else, I forget.  The dog had no collar, no chip, and, because she wasn't spayed, was in heat - she was actually wearing a diaper.  I'd never seen a doggy diaper before.  The woman told me that she had to brush out some matted hair, but otherwise the dog seemed healthy, if a little underfed.  We exchanged numbers.\n\nOne week later, the owners still had not come forward.  I took in the dog.  After another week, no sign from the owners, so I 'officially' named the dog (I stopped calling her Mutt-face), took her to the vet, had her spayed, updated all her shots and otherwise started her account at my vet.  I love her like crazy.\n\nAnd then last week, three months later, I'm walking both of my dogs around the neighborhood and a man in an SUV pulls over and waves me over.  \"That's my dog,\" he says.\n\n\"No,\" I say, \"that's my dog.\"\n\nLong confrontation short: he's showing me photos on his phone; I'm telling him I don't care; he's following me in his SUV as I continue walking; I tell him to fuck off; we're in the neighborhood so eventually his wife and 2 small children show up; I keep walking; he shows me where they live and keeps following me; he tells me how he put up signs and called animal control and put a post up online somewhere; I don't care.  All the while he's taking pics of me and my dog and grabbing at her collar.  I call my wife and have her come pick me up and we hightail it outta there.  I'm 98% certain that my dog used to be his dog.\n\nI don't plan on giving her back.  He can get a lawyer and come after me if he wants.  I'll fight.\n\nAITA for keeping the animal?", "created_utc": 1675912829, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10xjwyy/aita_for_not_returning_a_familys_dog/", "score": 599, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Someone dumped a German Shepherd puppy in our neighborhood, and she was an absolute sweetheart. My family instantly fell in love with her. We took her to the Humane Society, and when she was never claimed (she wasn\u2019t chipped) we legally adopted her. There\u2019s a proper way to do things.", "TBF, I\u2019m curious how much of the general population know the proper channels to work this type of situation. I would have done as the first lady and posted on Nextdoor, PawBoost and all other social media, then to the vet to check for chip as well as placed signs around the neighborhood in vet\u2019s offices, local businesses.\n\nAnimal control would have never crossed my mind. Animal control triggers me to think of all the scary guys out to take dogs to the pound and eventually euthanize them.

Did the dog recognize the family?  I\u2019ve found a fair amount of dogs roaming and one that I have now we put up signs and made posts on websites but we also looked on those websites to see if anyone lost their dog. His original owner contacted us a few weeks later and said to just keep him cause she couldn\u2019t. I feel like OP could have done a little more to find the dogs owner seeing as the family lives in the same neighborhood.", "When the guy first confronted me, the dog cowered, tail between her legs.  She was friendlier when the wife showed up and showed some interest.", "Not every lost animal needs to be reported to animal control. If you are capable of fostering it\u2019s probably better since shelters are overrun.", "He's an ass for leaving a dog running around without being spayed.  I had to deal with that here when a neighbor's dog basically runs around and she was in heat while screeching because this big black dog wanted to pounce.  I had to call animal control because the male was climbing on me to get to her.  I ended up covered in scratches and bruised.", "Eh the spaying is fine. If the dog was turned over to a shelter or rescue they would have done it anyways.", "Idk why this response is hilarious to me. Lmao", "Probably the same way OP missed all the lost dog signs \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Same. If they are in the same neighborhood and were looking for her they would have seen it. I\u2019d assume there would still be a flyer posted somewhere in that neighbor. So in 3 months time they never once saw a flyer? Or even put out their own?", "Doesnt that theory go out the window when they do find her and clearly want the dog back? \n\nAlso if its the same neighborhood how did OP not see the signs the owner put up?", "Not sticking up for the owner, but a few points. It may have had a collar and it slipped out. Dogs don\u2019t have to be spayed and may not have been in heat when she got out. The dog, according to the post, was only slightly matted and under fed, if the dog had already been missing for a short time before the first person found her, both are logical results. So owner may not be an AH. Of course, if all my points are wrong, then I 100% agree, they don\u2019t deserve the dog", "How do we know the dog didn\u2019t get lost before her appointment to be spayed? Depending on the length and how long she was out, matted fur could be from escape and not neglect? Maybe they had just gotten her and she didn\u2019t have time for a chip (normally done during spay anyways). Maybe she slipped her collar and that\u2019s how she got lost?\n\nIf OP had done the right thing to begin with, we\u2019d probably have the answer to most of these questions. OP is the AH for stealing this family\u2019s dog and not even trying to find the owners and for now admitting it\u2019s their dog but he still won\u2019t give it back.", "Thank you!

Not how life works. OP is stealing a dog.", "Uhh yeah the guy who is keeping the dog and refuses to give it back to the owners is the ah.", "The difference being that YOU.... The owner of the dog.... decided to leave the dog with the people that found it..... OP is a dog thief that refuses to return a dog to it's rightful and legal owner.

Most people look to the local shelters or animal control to find lost animals it\u2019s unreasonable to assume they have all these socials medias.

In my state it\u2019s the law that you have to report to animal control and search for owner. Reporting to animal control doesn\u2019t mean the dog has to go to the shelter, it just means filing a found report that the owners can use to find their dog). If you keep a lost pet without reporting to animal control it\u2019s considered theft", "Not to get into semantics too deeply, but I think you and I may have different interpretations of \"reporting to animal control.\" I've lived in states where you can call animal control and say, \"I found a lost dog, 10 pounds, black with white markings on her nose, paw and tail. I'm keeping her until the owner is found. This is my name and number ...\" Animal control will then keep that info on file in case someone calls in. \"Reporting to animal control\" and \"surrendering to animal control\" are two different things, in my experience at least.", "No, reporting to animal control is not the same as surrendering to the shelter. You can report that found dog and keep it until the owner is found", "False. That could be someone's pet. You are obligated to at least TRY to find out if someone has reported their dog missing. With your logic, I am allowed to grab up a dog I see wandering and drive it 3 hours away to my house and never report it. Leaving 3 little children without their beloved dog.", "Thats up to animal control to decide.", "Do you know how the dog got loose? Or why it wasnt spayed?", "If they had turned it over to animal services, maybe the family would have found her before the animal was altered. Just because an animal is picked up doesn't mean that it is automatically spayed or neutered. There's a process, and it usually takes a few weeks.", "Exactly. Do people expect a lost dog to be immaculately groomed? My dogs hair can get matted just walking from one room to another.", "Because OP is in fact, now a dog thief.", "They put up flyers and posted on missing dog websites.  The lady that originally found the dog may have done more and he's just not aware.  The dog wasn't chipped and didn't have a collar so her owners didn't make it easy for them to be found in case she got lost.  They messed up here but it's not his fault.", "That\u2019s what they said they did but it doesn\u2019t add up especially if it\u2019s been months and they live in the same neighborhood. OP that found her has been taking care of her. There is another comment here where the same situation happens to them but from the pov of the original owners. OP clearly loves her an she is now part of their family.", "They said that did but from what I understand in the post, the family lives in the same neighborhood that OP lives and also walks both dogs so it seems like they would have seen them walking way earlier than months later.", "Where does it say they were hiding their dog for months? I would think they probably were walking both dogs like normal around the neighborhood the other family also lives in and no one ever approached them until now. I don\u2019t think stolen is correct. OP helped out the lady, who originally rescued her, by offering to foster, and then organically she became part of OP\u2019s family after they put in the time and care. In this day and age majority of pet owners chip their pets as a precaution to make sure they are found if list. Most owners also spayed and neuter unless planning to breed.", "lol I read that and rolled my eyes. I\u2019m typing this blind", "States differ with laws and even cities can have different laws when it comes to animal ownership rights. OP should look them up where they live. Them having a paper trail will probably help their case from a legal standpoint unless the family can provide proof it was their dog originally.", "Sounds like OP waited and the Vet wouldn\u2019t have spayed if they thought the dog was too young for it", "OP has not claimed to do anything. The flyers and post where done by the woman who found the dog \n\nAlso how do they know the dog wasn\u2019t chipped if they didnt take the dog in somewhere to actually check for the chip? Oh, because they didnt.", "So youre blaming the owners for not happening to stumble upon OP walking the dog? But not OP for making zero effort to find the owners?", "Not spaying a dog isn\u2019t abuse. Guy did not take animal to shelter to find owners. It\u2019s all there. I\u2019ve had a dog stolen and that pain is unbearable. To knowingly do something like that is atrocious, disgusting, horrendous. That guy is straight up evil.", "True but since the owners stated they went to ac first, I\u2019d lean towards them having some sort of animal control reporting requirement. If there wasn\u2019t that wouldn\u2019t likely be the first place the owner would look.", "Op shouldn't have done anything but surrender the dog to animal services. Not their call.", "Lol. Thats what you think. I copied this right off the ASPCA website, \u201cWhile the traditional age for neutering is six to nine months, healthy puppies as young as eight weeks old can be neutered.\u201d", "Lol vets check for a chip before they chip them.\n\nEither way, someone looked for the owners and owners were not found for weeks.  I'm not sure what point you're trying to make here.  At some point, after doing your due diligence, you have to rehome the pet or keep it. I guess you could look at it as the woman looked for the owners, did her due diligence, and then rehomed her if that makes you feel better.", "Based off of the knowledge we have from this post, the family did not spayed her or chip her let alone have a collar with identification to make sure if they lost her that she would be found. While the lady, that originally found her, was looking for the owners, OP helped by fostering the dog. During this time OP took her to the vet and made sure all was well and has now integrated her into their family with their other dog. This isn\u2019t over the span of days or a couple of weeks, it\u2019s been months. I would think that living in the same neighborhood would greatly increase the chances of seeing OP walking both dogs along the same routes.", "Thank you - using the dog being intact as evidence of abuse?

This suggest to me that the original owners were negligent and legally OP is in the right. They put up signs and waited to claim ownership. \n\nAnimal control is not necessarily the same in all areas. Where I live they don\u2019t deal with lost pets, if they find them, they go into the shelter which makes its best effort to find the owner.\n\nHonestly, chip and neuter your pets people!", "NTA. At the worst, OP really misunderstood the process and didn\u2019t question their luck. Everyone gets into situations like that.

I\u2019ve nearly caught a dog named Bear twice now - he\u2019s always extremely matted, isn\u2019t too hungry but thin (he is big enough to take down prey for sure), and knows to stay out of the road. Doesn\u2019t even have a collar on. But his family \u2018loves him\u2019 and \u2018he loves them\u2019 (even though he wouldn\u2019t get into their car either even with the promise of food.

And I\u2019m glad OP and that lady were there to help.\n\n(Btw, OP has commented and said animal control exists in their area, but it literally doesn\u2019t in my county, despite being decently populated. No control, no shelter. The cops are supposed to be in charge of it since there\u2019s no specific branch, but both times I tried to do something about it they sent me on a telephone wild goose chase that basically ended with, \u201cWell if it didn\u2019t bite anyone, isn\u2019t chained up and abuses, or isn\u2019t rabid, we can\u2019t really do anything ma\u2019am.\u201d. \n\nSo, don\u2019t automatically assume that OP is negligent or willfully ignorant - in my book they\u2019re lucky to have an animal control!)\n\nUnless if/when this comes to a court case, the \u2018original\u2019 owner can pull out some handier and more legally weighty documents than a spay and chip record, I don\u2019t think this guy is going to get the dog.

But is OP a butt if they don\u2019t? No. No one acts their best in a confrontation and that guy was clearly aggressive. \n\nOP, I hope this gets resolved peacefully. I know I\u2019d be very upset if this happened with my sweet girl, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019re in the wrong for wanting to keep your dog.

If a stranger found your pet, they would have taken them to a vet ( like what op did) and the vet would have found the chip and contacted you so you would have still gotten your dog back. \n\nPoint is you did your due diligence as a pet owner because the risk of losing ur pet is pretty high. Random ppl on the street are not obligated to report any random animal to animal control also not everyone knows about calling animal control when they find a lost pet.

If they didn't care, why are they trying to get the dog back at all?", "I missed that part. Sorry. Yeah, I wonder how he missed found dog posters while he was apparently hanging up his own.\n\nI do agree that it was rather neglectful not to chip and spay the animal. Either the parents are willfully ignorant or they didn't want the animal in the first place and only bought it because the children were nagging for it. Which would also explain why it took them three months to approach OP. At least in my opinion.", "Microchips move and are difficult to find all the time.

The vet also recommended me to wait for 2 heats to spay her so she could fully grow. And if she was wearing a diaper, she is probably an inside dog that ran away.. hence the no collar. My dog wears a harness (with an AirTag) to go on walks but at home she doesn\u2019t wear anything.
