Things are great between us, it's a really loving relationship. Bit of a back story. Ever since I was young, I never had good experiences with my birthdays, not in a spoiled way of \"I didn't get what I wanted\" but more of people not turning up after they've been invited. Or people only wanting to hang around if my brother was around.\n\nBasically a lot of let downs which took a toll on me mentally. Fast forward to me meeting my now partner, went on few dates, I asked him questions like favourite food, hobbies and of course \"When is your birthday?\". Now most people would ask same questions back, and he did. Apart from the birthday one, and I took that as a sign of \"Let's just not tell him, it's just a random day I don't care about just as much as others in the past didn't\"\n\nDon't get me wrong, my parents always wish me a happy birthday and try their best to spend time with me and just have a nice small gathering with just myself and them and a close family friend, so typically just the 4 of us (My brother no longer lives in the country)\n\nSo this year things were a bit different. I had some house problems and temporarily moved in with my partner in the next city over (One day I'd live with him, but he does have 2 housemates and I don't know them that well, and my parents  place is too small as I also work from home still)\n\nSo my birthday comes of which my partner is not aware of, we're chilling just doing the usual and then we hear a knock on the doors, he goes to check who it is. And of course it's my parents And it's my parents with a birthday cake, and birthday balloons and presents. He's obviously shocked.\n\nThey come in, my partner calls me downstairs, and my parents wish me a happy birthday and the look on my partners face is as if he saw a ghost. My parents noticed but didn't say anything. My parents now left.\n\nThis is where the fun starts. My partner of course asks when my birthday is, I tell him it's today and there's this huge pause and he just goes back upstairs to his/our bedroom. I took few minutes to compose myself went to check on him and he goes \"We need to talk\". I sit down on the bed, he asks why I haven't told him, and he did say that he realised we never did anything for my birthday or that he didn't actually know when it was. I explained to him my past experiences hoping he'd be understanding and that I just really don't care about my birthdays. It quickly led to him saying that he doesn't trust me, and he basically continued to blame me for this situation and I tried to reason with him. He raised his voice numerous times, questioning things. I called my parents to turn around and take me with them as I needed some space. I explained it all to them. The next day I woke up to a text message from my partner asking to get my stuff and leave the keys.\n\nSo, AITA?

He sounds really self obsorbed and tbh I get the feeling things aren't as great as you're trying to convince yourself and us because who never questions their partners birthday in 5 years and just how quickly he turned and made out you were the problem and you should have told him when he made 0 effort to learn your birthday from the very start", "NTA. Your boyfriend\u2019s reaction to your birthday naturally never coming up is concerning. He additionally had plenty of opportunities to ask (5 years? hello??) and never did, so he doesn\u2019t get to throw a tantrum when this sort of thing happens.\n\nGet outta there.

You should have been straightforward with your partner that your birthday is on X date but you don't enjoy making a big deal of it due to past experiences. I think breaking up with you completely was a bit much, but I do think you also played a bit of a stupid game and won a stupid prize. Take this as a lesson to communicate better in your next relationship.", "Your feelings about your birthday are completely valid.\n\nAlso, it is not compulsoray to celebrate your birthday. It is your day, so your choice how to fill it in.\n\nYour parents could've given you a head up before coming over, so you could have either dissuated them, or informed your partner.\n\nYou explained the situation. It's up to your partner to accept the way you feel about birthdays or not.\n\nI think your partner feels shitty because he found out he never once celebrated your birthday in the five years that you are together, while you've probably celebrated his every year. He's confronted with his shallow side.\n\nPerhaps he also feels like he doesn't really know you as he wasn't aware of this part of you. In those **five years** of being in a serious relationship, you could have talked about it.\n\nAnd he must have felt ridiculous in front of your parents.\n\nThat's a ray of different feelings for which he is blaming you because of your lack of communication.\n\nCommunication is key in a relationship, and you never communicated about this, you even actively avoided it when he did enquire about your birthday, and then made sure it never came up again. And you NEVER invited him to your birthday celebrations with your parents, basically lied about them. \n\nSo, for your lack of communication, for FIVE years, while in a serious relationship (you mentioned one day wanting to live with him), and for him not noticing that you have also aged during those five years :\n\nESH\n\n* EDIT to add ESH", "ESH him for not realizing for years that you weren't celebrating your birthday and you because you moved in with him and had your family show up to his place without warning to celebrate the birthday you supposedly don't celebrate.

How does that not come up?", "YTA - You might be glossing over it but it sounds like there have been other problems where you have hid things or haven\u2019t been trustworthy, and this was the final straw. If things were so great your boyfriend wouldn\u2019t have broken up so quickly after 5 years.\n\nTo be clear, you actively lied to him about a pretty basic fact about yourself. Your explanation makes little sense. You enjoyed lying  and withholding something from him. I bet this isn\u2019t the first time.
