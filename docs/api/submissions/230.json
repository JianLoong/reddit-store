Your LDS parents will never accept that you're an atheist. Unfortunately, as long as you're under their roof, you should expect more punishments and lectures if you continue to defy them. It's definitely not right on their part.", "Running away probably wasn't the right move as it would definitely cause any reasonable parent worry but ultimately you're NTA for wanting to have them respect whatever spiritual (or lack of spiritual) journey you're on.", "NTA. I know how hard it is to believe something different from the rest of your family so congrats for you just being able to tell them. But you're completely correct they did not respect your beliefs. I would have a serious talk with them about boundaries.", "NTA\n\n(also a Former Mormon)\n\n[You can't consent to be born, so you owe your parents ***nothing***](https://youtu.be/p7cOwQQDI7o). You don't have to be lifelong friends with them if you don't want to.\n\nFWIW, it sounds like you might be better off flying under the radar until you're 18\u2014legally there isn't much you can do until then, and they've made it clear that it's not safe for you to be honest with them in the mean time. If you wait a few weeks and tell them a tear-jerking \"found my faith\" story, they'll eat that shit right up. Conveniently, nobody can ever call you on a lie about ***belief***\u2014and that works both ways. The Spirit^(TM) or \"missionary work\" can justify almost any activity, life plan, \"bad influence\" friend, job that makes you work the odd Sunday, etc. as long as you keep it lore-friendly and lay it on thick how much you care about what God has told you to do. If you're ever busted for something or your unbelief is outed again, you can probably get away with inventing a repentance story / faith rediscovery story once every two years or so.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with playing along with their game of make-believe (is that even lying?) when your safety, freedom, or future would be threatened by complete honesty. Tell them (and your bishop) what they want to hear, and they'll leave you alone. Lying like this usually poisons relationships, but it's better to worry about patching relationships that you care about once you're safely outside an unequal power dynamic.\n\nIt sounds like your parents are intense enough that it'd be worth making a plan to quietly move all savings to a new bank account that they won't be able to touch as soon as you turn 18. Some kids over on /r/exmormon have had savings stolen when parents realized that was the only leverage they had left. If things get ***really*** dicey (i.e. if you have good reason to fear physical violence or getting kicked out), make sure you know where all your vital documents are, keep a bug-out bag somewhere, have a list of friends' couches you can safely crash on, and have CPS's number handy.", "NTA. \n\nThe only worthwhile thing you can really do is sit down and have a proper conversation about it, not a shouting match or debate as to why X religion is incorrect and Y belief is better, but lay everything out on the table and tell them why you feel the way you do. 98% chance they won't care and will still try to tell you why their beliefs are gospel, but it's the best thing and the least risky thing you can do.", "NTA to want to leave this all-encompassing cult-like religion, but you are still a minor and it's going to be really tough to do it openly while still living with your parents.\n\nEDIT: Sorry, I'm a bit biased against LDS, with some experience. I apologize if anyone is insulted.", "NTA. If the story is true you didn't even say anything offensive or rude, you just stated your beliefs. \n\nThey're literally just discriminating against you. Ask them what would Jesus do?", "NTA. The LDS/Mormons are the kind of cult where it is unfortunately best to fake it until you can gain full freedom. Using logic against people that legitimately believe a confirmed fraud used magic to make up his own religion where he could fuck whoever he said god said he could is pointless. They will say they will respect you but you have seen what they will actually do. You have the freedom to choose what they tell you to choose. You will most likely have to work towards your freedom and pretend to care about their cult until you can finally, legally shake off the shackles of their \"religion\" and being stuck in their home.\n\nEdit: Walking home without telling anyone doesn't really make you an asshole but they are going to be looking for reasons to punish you and reasons to tell the other cult members that you are a bad kid that hates god. You should prepare yourself for being treated like an apostate. There are resources out there for apostates if your home life becomes abusive.

Regardless, in your place I might refuse participation in church in another way that doesn't have them worried about you like they probably did when you disappeared on them.\n\nUnfortunately, in the end it's their house, and their rules.

You are 14, so you are going through a stage in life where there'll be many conflicts with your parents; pretty much everyone goes through this, some worse than others.  You have your rights to your own believes and they have their responsibilities to raise you and supervise you; taking you to church with them is part of their responsibility of raising you and supervise you - rather than leaving you home alone.

Until then, they do pretty much have say over if you go to church or not. It sucks, I know. I also had to go to church till I was an adult. But like, in the long run it doesnt matter. I do fully understand that right now its a super big deal, and your feelings on that are valid. But like, once you cant be forced to church as a minor, you have the other like 4/5ths of your life to choose to not attend services. So like, keep your chin up is what I'm trying to say.", "NTA. I had to attend Catholic mass for years and didn\u2019t believe it but I have to hand it to my parents, once I was an adult they never said a word about religion to me. \n\nYou may need to put up with this for a few more years if your parents won\u2019t budge. There are ways to make it less onerous. I used to bring a book and read as my parents were the type who didn\u2019t like to call attention to themselves so they didn\u2019t say anything to me while at church.  I also volunteered as an usher - that let me stay in back and wander around a bit. Luckily in the 80s when I was your age it was the thing for teenagers to go to church together and not sit with parents so a lot of Sundays mass was more about socializing and drama LOL. \n\nOnce during my senior year in high school I was zoning out during mass when they read that passage from the Bible where Lot\u2018a daughters get him drunk to have secs with so they can have children. I accidentally blurted out \u201cthat\u2019s messed up\" and everyone around me laughed and the priest had some explaining to do.", "Nta. When I read LDS and atheist I knew you were in for trouble. But sadly you're 14 so you're stuck with them for 4 years. I honestly hate to say this, it makes me completely sad for you.... But I think your best option is sucking it up and going along with their bs. If not you're in for a hell of a 4 years and you'll be even more miserable. I guarantee no trick or treating would just be the start of their punishments. I'm not sure about your parents but I heard LDS parents can be pretty dang ruthless when it comes to religion.", "NTA but it may be better to suck it up and go to church until you are older so that you can have the freedom instead of being in trouble.\n\nAlso disappearing like that may have worried your parents that something bad happened, so don't do that.  \n\nLearn to tune out the church service and enjoy the time in your own head.  You can daydream as long as you appear to be paying attention.  Think of it as your time to chill out.", "Nta-but I do not think you'll win hold out until your 18. I am not Christian.

And I agree with the poster that said to keep your important documents and any funds in a safe place in case you have to make a getaway.

It's just really disappointing for me, it's my favourite part of the year.", "So then what the fuck was the point of the crusades and all of the other forced conversions?", "There was no point. Conversion has to be made by a willing participant. The crusades were unbiblical and so are all other forced conversions. It had to do with people in power wanting more power, money, women, etc. That's what it always boils down to. There has to be a true, genuine belief, with a change of mind, otherwise there's no salvation (Romans 10:9-10; 2 Corinthians 7:10). The people being forced were being forced unbiblically."]}
