{"id": 7681, "submission_id": "10fhwoz", "title": "AITA for walking out of my STEM family's New Year's party & ignoring them?", "selftext": " I (25M) am part of a large STEM family. My entire family is Ive league educated, my parents, 5 siblings, etc. They're all doctors, scientists, and mathematicians. I am the only one who isn't. Growing up I was always the black sheep, school just didn't come easy to me. They even had me tested for learning disabilities at one point. I had nothing but I just wasn't good at school.\n\nI spent my entire childhood crying over math textbooks wondering why I don't get it? Why it's so easy for them and not for me? Art came easy, literature came easy. But to my family that was trash and not worth focusing on. It didn't help that they kept sending me to the same academic schools my siblings went to, those schools were brutal, the competition there was fierce, and kids were literally snorting Adderall to get through exam week.\n\nThat environment didn't help. Things didn't improve until I moved out at 18, and got a job at a tattoo parlor. I was able to get an art degree, I started writing, going to therapy, and got a boyfriend. My life just got better because, for the first time, I could just be me. My family couldn\u2019t accept this, and contact with them became less and less.\n\nEvery time I meet them they never make an effort to talk to me about the things I like, they just talk among themselves about STEM subjects I don't understand. I try to engage with them but the things they discuss I just don't know. Whenever I ask questions they get annoyed because now they have to dumb things down for the family idiot.\n\nThe only time they talk to me is to discuss my failure in life. Mostly I just sit there quietly. That's how my whole life has been with them. Recently I got a publishing deal for my fantasy novel. I was super excited to tell my family at their New Year's party. The first thing they did was ask what kind of novel was it, when I said fantasy they awkwardly laughed and changed the topic to my cousin's PDH thesis. This was my biggest achievement and they shat on it.\n\nI told them they were being rude, and that they'd treated me like crap my whole life. They snapped back to stop making a scene, that I had been a difficult child and to be understanding. I really lost it then. I screamed that I was never a difficult child, I never drank, sneaked out, stole, did drugs, or got into a fight. I just wasn't into science, which isn't a big deal at all. So what if I wasn't good at school? Any other family would have been glad to have. I left after that.  \n\nSince then they\u2019ve been trying to contact me. To be fair they do seem very apologetic but I\u2019ve been ignoring them. My dad\u2019s last text said I\u2019m being childish and I need to talk to them. A part of me feels bad because I ruined New Year's and a lot of my family's colleagues were there too and they witnessed it, which was probably humiliating for them. They work in really prestigious, competitive fields and I humiliated them.

This happens when people hold things in for a long time and it\u2019s understandable. \n\nWhen you\u2019re ready, I\u2019d talk to them. Apologize for yelling at them at the party and explain your side. Explain that just because you\u2019re different to your siblings doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re difficult.

It seems like although you haven't followed the normal family path into a STEM field or job, that you are still doing well and being responsible (no drugs, etc.).  Getting a publishing deal is a big accomplishment and something worth celebrating, even if it is an accomplishment that they may not really understand.  \n\nThat said, it seems like maybe after this last incident they are starting to understand.  For someone coming from that kind of background, even though you are accomplishing a lot, it may be difficult for them to understand because it is such a different path.\n\nI would recommend responding to them, giving them another chance... if it goes bad again, maybe it's time to cut ties, but to me it would be worth giving them one more shot, hopefully they can finally understand that just because you are going in a different direction as they did doesn't mean that you are a failure or doing something wrong.\n\nAnd congrats on the book!", "NTA.

You are a human, of equal value to other humans. The fact that you're not good at science doesn't make you worth less as a person - it just means you have less in common with your family.\n\nGetting a publishing deal for a novel is an achievement that is worthy of note. It may not be the kind of novel your family would enjoy reading, but they can still reasonably ask things about it - when will it be published, what state is it in, is it a standalone novel or will you be writing a series, how well does it have to do to get you an offer for a second book, and so on.", "NTA\n\nCongratulations on the book. Your dad does not sound apologetic, just block him.

Best advice I could give you: Heal your inner child and try to remember that you only need your own validation.

My dad was the only one that could keep up. He was a  professor/banker, dual career. But he had undergrad degrees in STEM. After spending years of time in school and focused on science my mind just thinks differently now. I appreciate history and art history, read Sci-fi and fantasy novels, tinker in a myriad of hobbies. But at the end of the day I can\u2019t relate to most of my family. I don\u2019t follow sports, I don\u2019t follow pop culture. So even the non STEM areas aren\u2019t relatable to my family. They take no note of any of my accomplishments. Most of their accomplishments seem minor to me. \n\nI think there is a person that isn\u2019t like the rest in every family. It doesn\u2019t mean our family doesn\u2019t care for us it just means we can\u2019t communicate in the same way. The best we can do is make some allowances for family and try to bridge the gap.

Everything you said to them at the party is true. Any other family would be proud to have someone as talented as you in it. Not everyone is good at art and writing. You are unique in your family and they should be proud you are different from them doing things THEY are unable to do. It seems like they created a clique in the family and excluded you from it. Reminds me of grade school behavior. The only thing that happened is that you were tired of being treated like the black sheep. This was a long time coming. If they didn't want you to do that at the party, they shouldn't have treated you this way. Plain and simple. They brought it upon themselves.", "NTA\n\nTelling someone they're childish isn't what I would call an apology. Might be time to just focus on your own path.

Also, you only have to defend your Ph.D. once. A friend I've known for over 40 years told me she wouldn't bother getting her Ph.D. if she had to do it again.

Brilliant.\n\nYou're NTA but they sound horrible, frankly.

You said it yourself, you were much happier when you moved out, and they have made you feel less than your whole life because you aren't STEM orientated, and they purposely dismiss you from conversations as an adult. Hell, you got a book published, and they could care less about it. Do you want these people in your life?", "NTA! They are freaking out because in front of their peers you removed their masks. They are also freaking out because their scapegoat their \"failure\" has escaped. If you don't ever talk to them again, if you don't ever engage with them again, it will only be better for you and they will be worse off for it. Since you were a child the entire dynamic in the family has been putting you down. There are different reasons this happens in a family. Sometimes it's because there is stuff going on in the background or they know they're not perfect but as long as they can b**** about you and tell themselves that you are worse than them, they feel that it's not that bad. Also since this has been the family dynamic since you were a child they don't know how to function as a family without grouping up against the odd person out. This is why while it will be better for you to never talk to them again which is what I would advocate for, it will be worse for them. Unless they do the hard work go to therapy and figure out why they feel the need to do this to somebody they're supposed to love they will repeat this pattern with whomever they consider to be the next least \"successful\", least like them individual in the family. The difference is since that person was originally a part of the \"in\" group they are going to kick back a lot harder and sometimes whole families can fracture once the designated whipping boy leaves and nobody's willing to be \"it\" for the family good. Honestly if that happens they get what they deserve there's no excuse for treating a family member that way just because they aren't exactly like the rest. Also in case you didn't get it from the rest of the message I think you're awesome. Getting a book deal is amazing writing fantasy is amazing. The fact that they're so stuck up and dysfunctional that they can't admit it on any level is sad. You are much better off without them. I hope you have an amazingly successful book, an awesome life, and are able to shut them out and never have to hear from them again if you don't want to.", "NTA. Congratulations on your book deal!

Congrats on the fantasy novel as well! I would love to read it some time! Fantasy is my favorite! It allows you to explore so many themes and the depths of what it means to be human. Fantasy novels allow you to explore the human experience. That\u2019s, in my opinion, just as or even more important.

Wow this family sucks.", "I don't have to know your family to know you are by the far its coolest member and the most fun at parties.", "I feel you.\n\nI worked at a musical instrument store during university, one of the staff there could hear a song once and play the entire thing back by memory despite not having any formal training.\n\nYet somehow I was the \"smart\" one on the staff because I was studying biology.", "P.S. congrats on getting out and making your way in life. Living well is still the best revenge!", "NTA\n\nI read over a year ago that some people that struggle with math are similar to  people with dyslexia that struggle to read, I wish I could remember the term for that.\n\n I suck at math, it was my most difficult subject at school, English, History, Biology, Geography I would pass with A+ but with math I struggled to make sense of math figures. I cannot add math figures in my head too, the numbers get jumbled even when I try to concentrate, I have to start over and over, my husband can add figures easily in his head, not me, it is too hard.\n\nEnjoy your published book, that is a big accomplishment, your family sounds like academic snobs.", "I honestly dropped a science class in college because of this. The professor opened the class by essentially telling us that we took the easy science class that non-science/math/premeds had to take. We weren\u2019t taking the *real* science version of the class but the dumbed down version./s\n\nThen he went on to say that anyone can draw a picture, making a dig at the art majors, and English majors just made up stuff\u2014that anyone could make up meanings or interpretations of \u201cMary Had a Little Lamb.\u201d\n\nI was looking into an arts major and taking the prerequisites for it. After that smug spiel, I waited until the class ended and dropped it immediately. Didn\u2019t think I needed to have a whole semester of *that.*", "My favorite response to someone saying dumb nonsense like \"anyone can draw a picture\" is just bet. I'll pull up a picture in the next 20 seconds on my phone. You draw it, well enough that people assume you went to art school.  And I'll give you my life savings. \n\nFail and you give me yours. \n\nThey'll squirm and it's great. Though never bio majors. Every now and then you get one that does art for fun.", "Have you seen Bones? Temperance Brennen, aka Bones, is a forensic anthropologist. So her job is one of the careers for forensic anthro. I nearly went into forensic anthro so I could study forensic archaeology.", "Oh, that\u2019s right. And I\u2019ve seen bones, I have all but the last two seasons on DVD and some the Temperance Brennen books. Lucky my local library has most of them but during COVID-19 I had to buy some. Kathy Reichs even answered my question on Goodreads, which was so cool because I definitely didn\u2019t think she would."]}
