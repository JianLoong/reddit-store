My one year old was refusing to calm down, and my three year old certainly wasn't making things easy.

My husband had initially agreed, but when I told him how long I intended to relax, he point blank refused me and made some excuse about having a 'skull splitting' headache, and how he couldn't look after the kids today for that long but will make up for it tomorrow. He did have to work overtime yesterday, plus had some important stuff at work going on for the past few weeks, which had been a huge cause of stress for him. I knew all this, but I thought it was only fair for me to get some time for myself after the day I had had today, and him looking after his own kids for a few hours just so I could have some alone time shouldn't be this big of deal. He could relax afterwards, after all (on the weekends, we each get one day free). He remained adamant however, and wouldn't budge. I got frustrated and told him to get over himself, and that him not taking responsiblity for his own kids was neglect, after which he acquiesced, albeit still reluctantly, while I left to take a bath. \n\nI thought this whole conversation was over as we were conversing normally afterwards, although he was a bit distant. I figured he would just forget about it later, I was wrong, however. Just after he left for work today, I got a call from my MIL who was literally screaming at me for not 'caring about her son and his needs, and for being a 'selfish' brat.' I was mortified of my husband having told her about our personal matters, especially when he didn't talk to me about it first.

I get needing a break but a weeknight 3-4 hr break is too much. (Coming from a SAHM myself.) If your husband gets home at 5:30 that means 8:30-9:30 is when you\u2019re done? That\u2019s the entire night. Screw you hubby. I\u2019m tired. You feed the kids dinner, give them a bath and put them to bed tonight bc screw you im done. He shouldn\u2019t have brought his mom into it. But when does he get some down time? He works hard too! Go take an hour break/bath but don\u2019t dump everything on him.", "ESH.  \" I was mortified of my husband having told her about our personal matters, especially when he didn't talk to me about it first.\"  He did talk to you.  He told you he had a splitting headache and asked you to do less than 3-4 hours you wanted.  You told him to do it anyways and refused to discuss it further.  I get it.  You need a break and you don't get a break for a headache when no one else is home, but you can't say he did not talk to you about it.  You could have taken a couple hours instead of 3-4.  He is for going to his mom.  His mom is for calling you.", "YTA more than your husband. You diminished him and dismissed his headache and by your own admission, you know he\u2019s been very stressed out. \n\nHe asked for less than four hours and you refused to compromise. You were not open to communicating. \n\nI\u2019m not going to hold it against him that he vented to his mom. If he were a woman who vented to HER mom, no one would think anything of it.  You didn\u2019t allow him a chance to communicate with you. \n\nYour MIL might be TA for yelling, but you need to hear and understand how you actually treated your husband. \n\nWhen your son grows up and gets a partner, you\u2019ll probably do the same thing too.", "Fellow SAHM.  YTA. Why do you get a 4 hour break after work but he doesn\u2019t?", "YTA - 3-4 hours is the whole day. Does your husband ever get to come home from work and do absolutely nothing? I\u2019m guessing not. And then to throw out neglect because he didn\u2019t want to be a single parent after working all day was bull. Could you not compromise and do an hour or two? It sounds like he had no problem giving you some time, just not all night.", "YTA overall, but your husband shouldn\u2019t involve his mother. But the reason you are the a hole is because YOU decided you need a break. Husband agrees but once he finds out that you are talking 3-4 hours he says he can\u2019t. ( I\u2019m guessing 3-4 hours is pretty much the rest of the time the kids will be awake if this is after work). He explains he has a headache and you also report his overtime and extra stress at work lately. Instead of compromising and taking less time, maybe 1-2 hours so you can both get rest you harass him, call him neglectful (which is a huge accusation) until he gives up and gives in. You even note that he doesn\u2019t seem happy about it but that he \u201cwill get over it\u201d. \n\nThen you complain that he went to his mother instead of talking to you. EXCEPT he did tell you how he felt in the original conversation, you over rode his opinion, basically showing him you think you are more important, that his wants/needs don\u2019t matter and even admitted you noticed him not being happy about it. YOU DIDN\u2019T CARE because you got what you wanted. Your MIL wasn\u2019t wrong about you being selfish and not thinking about your husband. \n\nYou should work on being open on your end to communication to hear and empathize what your husband is telling you or he won\u2019t talk to you because he will just be told he is neglectful. Your MIL being involved is a symptom of the problem. You need to fix the problem which is being you need to work on compromise and good communication with your husband. If you continue on this path you will continue to have symptoms of an unhappy marriage.\n\nHaving children is hard. My dad always told me \u201cit always takes 110% from both parents.\u201d Of course that is impossible because each person can only physically do 100 percent so there will always be lacking and there will always be tiredness, at least until the kids get older. Each partner needs to watch out for the other and put them first. It only works though if both partners do that.", "YTA. He DID talk to you,  you just decided to throw a fit instead of listening like a grown ass adult.  Taking 3-4 hours and not letting him have any of his day or night to himself is just selfish and entitled.  He shouldn't have involved his mom but if you had made ANY attempt to compromise it wouldn't have been an issue", "Although I can understand that you needed a break after a full day of looking after the kids.. so did your husband after a day at work. Learn to compromise, he seems like a nice enough guy. Also apologize. YTA", "YTA, by god. Both been working all day but soon as he puts the key in the door you want the WHOLE night off? Nah it's not how it works, he was willing to compromise and you're just like talk to the hand peasant. And then you decide to just throw out he is neglecting your kids... Really?? MIL shouldn't butr in, maybe he was getting to get after your shenanigans and she took it on herself to call you on it. You saying you've never done something similar? I can't imagine what you're like to live with, I hope he divorces your selfish behind", "YTA both for how your acted initially and after. I mean a 3-4 hour break, come on! Yes staying home with kids is hard and stressful. So is working, so you are both tired and spent at the end of the day. I\u2019m sure your husband would have been happy to give you say 20 minutes of some quiet time to relax but 3-4 hours?! So you\u2019re just checking out for the rest of the night once he gets home from work? That is not reasonable.", "YTA. Why do you \"deserve\" 3-4 hours of doing nothing after an 8 hour work day but he has to put in his 8 hours at work and do another 3-4 hours by himself?", "YTA and a very selfish partner. You admit that your husband has also had a stressful and difficult week and you demand 4hrs?? That's the whole night.. so he comes from work exhausted and does more work while you do nothing because you need 4hrs to relax? \n\nI'm a SAHM of 2 as well before you hit me with the \"You don't understand.\" I would never ever do that to my husband. \n\nYou know what I do when I'm exhausted and I know he is too.. we divide and conquer. We decide to split the rest of the evening as fast as possible so we can relax sooner. \n\nI couldn't imagine being like \"Oh you have a headache. Tough luck.\" All I hear from you is \"me,me,me,me,me\"\n\nHis mother shouldn't have called you but she wasn't wrong about you being a selfish brat. \n\nI hope your husband stands up for himself against you.", "YTA you threw our neglect and that\u2019s a pretty nasty thing to accuse him of. I\u2019m sure you were both tired. You seem to only think about you being tired. If you said you need an hour, it sounds like he would have been fine. Work can be very mentally and, depending on the job, physically exhausting. You\u2019re physically exhausted. Neither is more important so maybe learn to compromise a little better.", "Nothing wrong with wanted a little break after a long day with the kids but 3-4 hours is excessive he\u2019s been working all day too , when he gets home you should help each other with the kids until bed time .", "Yta. Yes they are his kids too but he is not neglecting them because he doesn't want sole responsibility of them for 4 hours after work! You know how tiring it is to take care of them. While you do that he works which is also tiring. So puting this all on him is not fair either. After work you should split the responsibilities... Also a one year old and a three year old should be in bed far earlier than 4 hours after your husband is back from work.", "YTA. In my opinion but I\u2019m prepared to get downvoted for it. \n\nYour husband has worked all day and doesn\u2019t have the opportunity for a break, he then gets home and you expect him to do 3-4 hours more work whilst you do nothing? Why can\u2019t you both be with the kids together and help each other, you\u2019re just throwing additional stress and work onto your husband for 3-4 hours (which is far too long) of additional work onto him. \n\nAdditionally, you said he worked overtime the day before and has had more important work to do this week (aka he\u2019s had an abnormally stressful week). Ngl, he\u2019s doing more work than you, you should help out each other with the kids rather than giving him even more work to do on his own. \n\nI\u2019m ngl, you\u2019re acting like your job is really difficult and you really need a rest (which is fine), but so does he! Which is why you should work together. \n\nI think the MIL should mind her own business and your husband shouldn\u2019t have said anything to her, but I think you\u2019re a bit of a pain personally.", "YTA, he's also been working all day! And to ask for 3/4 hours is extreme.  It would have been reasonable to ask for a hour whilst you had a bath but no. When does he get his rest? And why do you have a day off each at the weekend?", "ESH\n\nYou had a bad day with the kid, he had a bad day at work with an headache. You are not more deserving of a break than he is. He seemed to have been fine with taking care of the kid while you take a break, but 3-4 hours is basically the whole night. He finish at 5, probably get home close to 6, so 3-4 hours get him to 9-10PM. It's not just a break, that's the whole evening.\n\nThe right thing to do would be to split the evening equally.\n\nTelling him that he was neglecting his kids was way over the line. He was ready to take care of them after work, just not for the whole evening. He even propose to take care of them more the next day, showing that he typically do his part.\n\nOn his part, speaking to his mother about your marital problems was pretty shitty and obviously your MIL shouldn't involve herself in such a situation.", "YTA and you should get over yourself.\n\nYou both were tired after a long day, but you selfishly decided that your need to relax for 4 hours was more important than taking a more reasonable break for an hour or two before helping your husband finish taking care of the kids for the rest of the evening. He gets his time to relax on the weekend? So do you, and apparently you also get to relax all night when you have a tough weekday too. \n\nAlso, he actually sucked it up and did the work and let you relax. He initially refused to help after realizing you didn't intend to \"get some time for yourself\" but actually were just going to take the rest of the night to relax in the bath and make him do it all alone. He said he couldn't do it for 3 or 4 hours AND offered to make up for it the next day.\n\nThis must be rage bait because it's too on the nose in its ridiculousness.", "YTA. Honestly if I (28F) worked all day and as soon as I got home from my stressful job I had to look after two unruly kids for three hours I\u2019d be pissed. Unfortunately, being a SAHM is an all day job\u2026 IMO. Probably an unpopular opinion. \n\nOn the flip side, I bet you do want a break! A SAHM doesn\u2019t get to physically disassociate work from home, I suggest trying to alter the kids sleep schedule so you can get them to bed closer to the time after your SO gets home.", "ESH Your husband did talk to you about it and you refused to spend less than 4 hours relaxing, which seems like a LONG time in the evening. Kids are hard, lots of us have been through this and some days are just exhausting. That's how it is and lots of people get no breaks ever.   He sucks for calling mommy. Mommy sucks for yelling at you about her baby boy. All of you sound like a hot mess. Time for REAL discussions with your husband about expectations, time management and what to do when one of you is totally overwhelmed by the kids and/or work. I would say enlist MIL to help but sounds like she's problematic.", "YTA. You both had bad days and legitimate reasons for needing a break.  The difference is he didn't insult you,  accuse you of neglect or diminish your efforts.  He only asked to reduce it from 3 to 4 hours.\n\nYou acknowledge that he's had really important projects and a stressful couple of weeks, was working overtime and had a skull splitting headache but basically tell him to suck it up because he can chill on the weekend, where you BOTH get a day off.  You show a considerable lack of empathy, support and understanding and your accusations of neglect are gross.", "You and your mother in law suck. Listen, I'm a SAHM to 6. Two have autism. I get that some days suck. But you don't get to screw off for hours when your spouse has had a tough day. Overtime sucks and it takes several days to recover from it. There are times my husband and I tag team the kids. He'll do 45 minutes so I can rest then I'll take it back over. Unless I can't move I take him into account.  Yta", "YTA.", "ESH, but especially you.  What did you think that being a SAHM of two little kids was all about?  Watching TikTok videos and getting your nails done?\n\nI'm willing to bet both kids took a nap, the house was a wreck and you didn't have any dinner prepared.  I think you're the one who needs to get over yourself.", "ESH - You -  for telling your husband what he was going to do instead of communicating your needs respectfully and listening to his feelings on the matter.   Your Husband - for running to Mommy, and MIL - for failing to mind her business.  \n\nBeing a SAHM is hard, working a full time job with overtime is also hard.  Your needs don't automatically trump his, just as his don't automatically trump yours.", "Let's just hope he's a mommy's boy and that's why he talked to  her about it. If I call my mom about my relationship problems that means the shit is about to get real. YTA, you come across as pretty exhausting to live with.", "YTA. Man works all day and then comes home and needs to continue working while you take a 3-4 break lmao wow. 1 your sure w.e, but you're literally expecting him to now do everything. Like did you at least cook dinner or was he expected to do that as well? \n\nYou admitted yourself that he's also been busting his chops but as soon as he says I can't do it for that long you tell him he's neglecting his kids? Not only is he not neglecting them he's supporting all of you. He probably told his mom because he clearly can't talk to you.", "Yta claiming he's neglecting his child.you sound  extremely manipulative and way to Willing to resort to nasty name calling", "YTA", "ESH I get needing a break but 3-4 hours after he just worked all day and has a headache, that\u2019s a lot. You weren\u2019t willing to discuss it, you just told him that\u2019s how it\u2019ll be. He shouldn\u2019t have gone to his mom (although do you ever go to your mom??) and his mother was out of line.", "You both have full time jobs. He goes to work, you stay home with the kids. You also both have part time jobs, everything that comes after he comes home from work. You don\u2019t get 3-4 hours of free time when he gets home, you BOTH need to get them fed and in bed TOGETHER.", "YTA. Everyone here has already said why you're the major AH. Your post and comments make me wonder how you got 2 children from the same man. I would have ran after having one with you. I'm sure that  there were red flags after the first one.", "YTA. I'm a SAHM as well.", "YTA. He worked all day, had been doing OT the previous day and had a few very stressful weeks at work and you expected him to do a full half day of work that evening with the kids? His job is way more stress than staying home all day. He's the entire breadwinner and if he doesn't grind out the work he can lose his job.", "ESH. Things are sucking for both you and your husband, but you both dug your heels in and demanded the other do all the work for for the whole evening.\n\nI don\u2019t blame your husband for talking about this issue with his mom. But she had no business calling you to yell at you. Her role should have been to give him advice on how to compromise and then keep her mouth shut.", "ESH. I\u2019m a SAHM of twin toddlers. It\u2019s a lot. Always. And my husband takes over when he gets home. But if he has an awful headache, I\u2019m *not* going to leave my kids with him. One, he\u2019s my husband and that\u2019s not fair to him and two, he can\u2019t be completely present when his head is coming apart. Your husband said he would make it up to you. Do you trust him or not?\n\nFor him to go whining to Mommy was low, too. And she sounds like a peach. \n\nYou guys *need* to communicate.", "Not TA for what you said to MIL but nice way of avoiding the internet criticism by swapping the actual TLDR.... Should be AITA for snapping at my husband... and yes you are. As a mom of 2 myself I get it. But he needs to decompress too and 3-4 HOURS!!! Ridiculous.  For that YTA\n\nTeach your kids quiet time; plain and simple....\n\nPark em in thier room;  and close the door... make sure the time are child proof and have cameras.... they don't have to nap they just have to play quietly for about 90 min.... go in your room and watch em on the camera while you do you.

Leaning more strongly towards you being TA. Your husband shouldn\u2019t have involved your mother in law. That\u2019s his screw up. You however, demanded 3-4 hours of relaxation when your husband came home from work unwell, during a hard week, with a terrible headache. Yes, your role as a SAHM is work, but he was at work all day too. Working to provide money for your family. I hate to break it to you, but although she never should have been involved-your MIL\u2019s words ring true. \n\nYou both need to communicate and figure out a compromise when neither of you are feeling great after a hard day.

Your kids being 1 and 3 I\u2019m going to guess go to bed around 8. So I think you asked for way to much time and should have asked for an 1-1:30. Which would have left your husband with the rest of dinner(maybe) and the rest of the night with the kids and then you come to help with bedtime. So in that story everyone was an ass but, if it was just you telling your mil to eff off then you were not TAH", "Small children can be stressful. But, they are only small for a few years. Don\u2019t worry about the house. Take your kids outside, walk with them, something so they can burn off some energy. Join a health club, find a play group, or join a pool where you can take them swimming. Kids love routine, activity, and socializing but can also feed off of your anxiety. Try making it \u201cstory time\u201d every evening at 7:30 after bath time and shut off all TVs and electricity, including your own phone. \n\nAsking for 4 hours alone time is excessive when the other parent also works all day. Maybe 3 nights a week, ask for an hour and a 1/2 to take a bath and have a glass of wine. On Saturdays, head to the grocery store alone or work out a \u201csleeping in\u201d compromise.\n\nI know it\u2019s tough, but try to enjoy them. Try to keep your sense of humor. Little kids are hilarious and everything is science to them. Collect pine cones and paint them, collect leaves, watch bugs. Don\u2019t worry too much about the mess.

Work is still hard. He doesn't go out for leisurely drives and meals alone, he is working so you can stay home with your kids. Bring a SAHP is a privilege that most parents wish they had. Is it hard being alone with the kids all day? Yes. I get it, I'm a SAHP. When husband gets home though, he may be able to offer you a breather/break, but you shouldn't dump the kids on him. He worked all day too, just like you did. Y'all should co-parent and work as a team together until bed time. I have a friend who got a job just to put her kids in daycare bc she couldn't handle full time SAHPing. It was too much mentally. It's not for everyone. It sounds like you and your husband need to sit and talk about expectations and desires, work/life balance, etc. Maybe you getting a part time job could benefit you mentally.\n\nETA: I agree that your MIL needs to stay in her lane and she was an AH, but it's not totally out there that your husband would vent his frustrations to her.

You might as well light your marriage on fire. \n\nI don\u2019t know how old you are but if you\u2019re married, please don\u2019t do this. If you\u2019re not married, please don\u2019t do this one day. \n\nNow OP kinda sounds like a nightmare so maybe he was okay with blowing it up.", "Idk. Some people are super close with their parents. My mom is one of my best friends so if we were on the phone or in the room with me when I needed to vent something, she\u2019d be the one to hear it.

When your partner is a work, no one is around to take over your role when it\u2019s time to go on break. I\u2019m specifically talking about when one parents sole job is to tend to the children and household, that is a 24/7 role and is not comparable to a corporate role. At all. You\u2019re not gaining hours of holiday pay, you\u2019re not receiving a pay check at the end of the week for a 24/7 hour job. I bet the husband goes to work where his clients aren\u2019t pissing and vomiting on him, unless he\u2019s in a medical field. There are no guaranteed sick days, holidays, what about her break when she\u2019s been \u201con\u201d all day looking after the kids? While the husband has been out of the house for 8> hours not being pissed and shat on, and being emotionally strung out from having to tend to literal babies all day? \n\n\n\n\n\nIf only we lived in a perfect world.\n\nEdit: added more to my comment x", "This is the only right answer.", "She didn\u2019t say she was going to ditch him the whole night.

I figured he would just forget about it later,\n\nHoly fuck, the lack of empathy from OP. The casual throw of the word neglect at him and acknowledging he is upset but expecting him to get over it. I'd say op and his mom are the asshole. He tried communicating and then tried venting or confiding and both probably made him feel less safe expressing how he feels in the future.", "Nope.

He has flaws, I have flaws, but in the end I love him and we work our problems out but those things you vent tend to stay with the  person you vented them to. They aren\u2019t there to see you make up. and They don\u2019t love your spouse like you do, so it will just create issues between everyone involved when they want to defend you.\n\nlesson learned here: don\u2019t vent little issues to your parents about your spouse. However you can ask for advice if you\u2019re willing to admit your wrongs as well.  Otherwise, find someone else To vent to \n\nWhen your spouse works and is also tired at the end of the day, don\u2019t dump the kids on that person. When the working spouse gets home, it\u2019s now a partnership. If both of you are Tired, consider getting a sitter to help out while you both rest.

Some kids just don\u2019t go to bed early. Getting them to sleep by 8 is about the earliest we could hope for.

Her hands are still very much full and who knows if her oldest still takes naps. My niece stopped her naps at 3 and my son is likely going to do the same. As stated her request was unreasonable due to the time length she's still an AH for that. However assuming she gets breaks during her day is also an AH move. It does sound like Dad is puking a good amount of weight from his willingness to watch the kids his request of a shorter time isn't unreasonable. However if your mom is likely to not take your venting as venting and it's likely to call up your spouse and complain for you, you likely know it at this point and know your shouldn't be venting to her.", "3 can still be a rough age.

He just wasn\u2019t willing/able to give her a 4 hour break in this one instance. \n\nThey apparently both get one weekend day to themselves and typically share the work most evenings. So the only time she\u2019s is *solely* responsible for the children and unable to clock out for even a few moments are 1) when he\u2019s at work himself and 2) presumably on his one weekend day. By contrast, he likely could ask for short breaks at work, but is still *working*. He then splits the work every night and takes over all of it on her weekend day off. The only time he *isn\u2019t* working at all is presumably on HIS one weekend day. Which is the exact same as her. \n\nI\u2019m not claiming that being a SAHM isn\u2019t incredibly hard work. And I\u2019m certain that more often than not, parenting and household duties *aren\u2019t* evenly split. But in this case, it sounds like it is, so I\u2019m not sure why you seem so insistent that she works nonstop whereas he doesn\u2019t. It seems pretty equitable based on her own account. There\u2019s just an insane amount of work to go around.", "Logic is a bit skewered there but alrighty. All I\u2019m saying is that they should be working together as a team once husband gets back. Not just the wife deciding to kick her feet up for 4 hours so the husband has to do an additional 4 hours of work lol. Do you think it\u2019s wrong for me to believe they should work as a team?", "Say he gets home at 6, they eat dinner, and then she leaves him at 630. 3-4 hours means 930-1030 at which point the kids are likely already in bed and he himself is likely getting close to bedtime.

You don't get to dictate what they do.  I know I've vented to my Mom in the past.  Not often, but when I needed outside perspective or just some support.  You seem to have no issue with her treatment of hubby - which is kind of gross TBH.", "Oh please, no one is crucifying her for needing a break.  I'm crucifying her lack of empathy, respect and down right shitty treatment of her hubby.  Hubby didn't dismiss her or tell her to suck it up until her day off on the weekend - that's what she did.  He agreed to giving her a couple of hours for a break, instead of 4 hours because he had a skull splitting headache.  Instead of being equally understanding of hubby's rough  days, weeks, etc, she accuses him of neglect, berates him, tells him to suck it and he can chill during his day off on the weekend.  She demeaned, dismissed and disrespected her husband and that is why she's the AH.", "Much like adults, not all children have the same circadian rhythm.

Unless he works certain fields or is likely that he has more break time then she does. She's still an AH for her length of time in her request and for the way she  spoke to her husband.

But in a **healthy** partnership, being a SAHP is just that: a job. *Not* a 24/7 role that they have to own 100% of, all of the time. \n\nMaybe the balance isn\u2019t perfect in terms of hours spent - or even effort exerted. If one parent has a cushier corporate job while the other has 4 screaming children with a stomach flu, yeah, the SAHP is going to have a more stressful day than the salesperson taking a client out for lunch and a round of golf. Or if one parent works a *very* physically demanding job - or an incredibly emotionally taxing one - whereas the SAHP has one fairly independent, calm kiddo that is in school for most of the day. \n\nBut in a healthy, functioning partnership where both partners made an agreement to have one of them stay home, there shouldn\u2019t be an expectation of the SAHP of doing *all of the work, all of the time*. That\u2019s not someone generally misunderstanding or underestimating how hard a SAHP works, that\u2019s someone that prioritizes themselves over their family and consciously chooses to deprioritize and devalue their partner\u2019s contributions in order to get out of doing their fair share.", "I am a SAHM (it seems you are also?), and I think it\u2019s important to separate that role at least somewhat from the overall role of being a parent.

Once the partner is home from work, the load should be split. So, if my partners\u2019 full-time job is 8/5, so is mine. Once they are home, we are both still working for several more hours, but trying to share the load equally/equitably.", "It\u2019s not a 24/7 role, at least no more than being a working parent is a 24/7 role. When the working parent comes home both parents should share in parenting and household responsibilities. That\u2019s true of holidays and weekends. Both SAHPs and working parents still get nap time and after bedtime to not need to actively parent. Both the one and three year old should be sleeping solid 9+ hour nights most nights. The SAHP is providing no active care during that time, and is no more responsible for wake-ups than the working parent.", "If that's the case, then why are you defending OP about needing a break  to me, when none of my comments suggested she didn't?
