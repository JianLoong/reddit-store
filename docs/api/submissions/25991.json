We recently welcomed our first child. We moved to my husbands home down 2 yrs agos and have been my in-laws neighbors for 1 yr. MIL expected us to spend all of our time at her house when my husband is home.My husband is only home on the weekend \n\nHis mom 47 is very religious. My husband and I have done things our own way. We lived together before marriage, had premarital sex, and share a bank account. I know this was hard for her since she was not in control of our decisions. MIL started making snide comments regarding EVERYTHING. Fast forward to last year when I found out I was pregnant.\n\nWe decided to announce to his family a few days later, they seemed thrilled. Turns out his mom was not and began telling people that we were too young and immature to be having a child and that if my husband continued to travel he\u2019d either cheat on me or our marriage would fail. Through out my pregnancy she had many things to say, such as naming MY child, where I delivered, etc. I decided to start inviting her to my appts and then the birth so she felt a connection with my sweet baby. \n\nShe always had something to say about how we chose to do things. From the type of diapers we used, to me choosing formula, etc.  I felt defeated and got extreme ppd\n\nNow present day, I have been in therapy for a few months, on meds and am feeling pretty confident in how I am as a wife and a mother. My therapist has opened my eyes to the importance of setting boundaries to protect my mental health. I asked my MIL to meet \n\nI started the conversation by saying \u201cto have a healthy relationship we have to have healthy boundaries\u201d she was so irritated and began to sigh and roll her eyes. I let her how that I felt as if I was not respected as a wife or mom because I have decided to make different decisions than she would because that is what is best for my family. I then brought up her comments regarding when I first began pregnant. This set her in a spiral, stating that I was ungrateful, because they have done so much for me. That was I was young, immature and had no life experiences (ma\u2019am if only she knew) she then began to tell me that I act bipolar and that next time I get pregnant she will be sure to throw a parade since I am such a princess. And where I don\u2019t have life experiences I have too high of expectations  and need to learn how not to be so controlling. I  began to realize this conversation wasn\u2019t going anywhere and that she is was proving right then and there why this conversation needed to happen. I then told her if she was going to continue to treat me this way and Ridicule how I have chosen to life then I was fine if she wasn\u2019t in my life or my childs anymore and that she won\u2019t be aloud to see him.

He also doesn\u2019t believe in therapy or mental health so I don\u2019t think that will be an option for me. I have tried to get him to move for months now and it always ends in a huge fight because he does not want to leave. He has been very open about how he doesn\u2019t like my family (part of why we moved away to where we are now) and never wants to be with my family. I have made an exit plan incase he does choose his mom over me as I am a SAHM. I sadly have a feeling he might choose her.", "Well that's kind of scary for you. So you've been isolated from your family and you are a SAHM so you are financially restricted there too as well. Definitely keep that exit strategy handy and talk to your therapist. I would keep track of everything toxic she does. \n\nMy husband didn't believe in therapy either thankfully he finally went when I said if he didn't I wanted a divorce. If he ever does decide to go I highly recommend a male therapist I know it is so freaking sexist but usually guys like that take therapy better from other males.", ">He also doesn\u2019t believe in therapy or mental health\n\nDoes he have a habit of making up reality to suit his prejudices? That sounds like an incredibly ignorant and, perhaps, fearful person. Does he believe in polio? Only what he can see and understand? So no black holes, no Milky Way galaxy? \n\nYou are NTA for finding a way to be firm with his mother, and are wise to have an exit plan. I agree he is far more like his mother than is comfortable.", "He did choose her, he literally said he was staying out of it bc he doesn\u2019t like drama. What he means is, he can\u2019t deal with drama from her-you, you\u2019re allowed to feel like shit. Also, he doesn\u2019t believe in mental health/ therapy? This is only going to get worse. NTA but it sounds like you\u2019re in a super shitty situation.", "Not sure about polio but I know he doesn\u2019t believe in covid\ud83d\ude05", "Oh dear. Save yourself and your baby.", "Leave leave leave he's just as crazy as his mom and he is not going to respect your boundaries with the kid or the kid's boundaries  in the future"]}
