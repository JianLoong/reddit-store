She's well intentioned nuisance but a nuisance nonetheless.", "NTA\n\nWTH?? You don't go into someone else's house and move stuff around bkz you don't like the way it is. \n\nBoundaries people Boundaries!", "Bruh....im an asshole on purpose most of the time and when i read stories like this im still just like 'who tf raised these people!?!?' \n\nNTA and honestly just kick them both out. i know thats your boy but honestly.", "NTA, she is staying in your home for 2 months - temporarily. There is no need for her to reorganize ANYTHING to her liking or to \"fix it\". But more importantly, she should have asked you if it is okay to do this or not. You are doing both of the a favor of harboring them during an emergency - that doesn't give either of them right to try and change how you live just because they don't like it. If they don't like it so much - find alternative accommodation.", "NTA who rearranges someone else's kitchen?? Maybe she has never had to clean anything in her life but it sounds like she is deliberately causing damage and problems so you'll stop asking her to help. \n\nIf I were you, I'd be telling her she has to find somewhere else to stay until she can go back to her own place. The disrespect is astounding.", "NTA\n\nIf this is her weird way of trying to join the family, she needs to understand it's a self-defeating one. It's probably just a poor attempt to be useful. Perhaps have a more in-depth discussion with her about how it's not helpful.", "NTA. This one kind of goes without saying. She's destroying your property and taking it upon herself move your things around that you now have to locate and put back where they belong. There a million things she can do like laundry, yard work, food preparation, dishes, etc that are far less likely to cause a disagreement. And your son has no right to be on your ass about anything. You're doing them a massive favor, they should be grateful. I don't think your daughter in law has reached the maturity level required to have a conversation with you about it so I think you should have a very brief and straight to the point conversation with your son. Tell him they will respect your rules and boundaries as long as they are under your roof and that's the final word on the subject.", "I'm an Atheist, but her going as far as to remove the crosses in your house is religious prejudice. She sounds awful. NTA", "NTA. It\u2019s pretty obvious she is making things worse. It would also be one things if you had told her once and it had stopped, but she rearranged things twice. It seems she isn\u2019t actually tying to help, but doing things for her own benefit. Either that, or she really is incapable of seeing things from other than her own perspective. In any case, she will be in for a rough time if it when she gets out into the world unless she learns differently. They are guests in your home, they need to act like it.", "NTA\n\nSit both of them down and say, very clearly, \"This is NOT your house. We have taken you in as a favour, that is all. You are not allowed to reorganise or throw away anything. The fact that you think you can is very disrespectful. I appreciate that you want to be helpful, but so far, your help is destroying our home. If you damage any further areas of our house, you will need to leave immediately.\"\n\nAre they paying to replace the mirror and restain the floor? Because they absolutely should be. And if your son continues to whine, tell him that he is a married man now and he needs to act like a grown-up. That includes respecting people who are doing you a favour.\n\nTheir marriage doesn't really have any place in this argument, so I wouldn't bring that up.", "NTA but she sounds either ill-intentioned or incredibly naive. (The cross thing obviously crosses a boundary, but the cleaning stuff could be poor judgment combined with not being taught these skills growing up and falling for false life 'hacks' off the internet.) Given that she's so young, it could be either, especially if she didn't learn these things in her family of origin. \n\nI'd be tempted to just mother this behavior to death. She wants to help? Great! First she gets a one-on-one, hands-on lesson on how the task should be carried out in your home. And directly ask her to not reorganize things because it makes it hard for you to find. Remind her that it is your space and it is actually counterproductive and rude of her to come in and redecorate, reorganize, etc. She can change the artwork on the walls of the bedroom they are staying in if she needs to satisfy that urge. \n\nIt may sound dumb, but if she hasn't had good parenting or good role modeling, breaking down these kind of basic tasks and basic social expectations directly may be your only hope. Good luck!", "NTA but I think you need to have a sit-down with her, your son, you, and your husband and explain the rules of the house. Even the boundaries that should be obvious to someone who does not pay to live there. Give these examples. Tell them the consequences if they do not respect the home and the homeowners. \n\nIf they're old enough to get married, they're old enough to respect house rules or live on their own and pay their own way regardless of emergencies like damage to the home (and shouldn't their landlord have to pay to provide a place to live?).", "NTA. If they are old enough to marry, they are also old enough to know how to clean a bathroom, be respectful of other people's property, and find the their own alternate accommodations if respecting you, your home, and you belongings makes it too difficult for them to stay at your place.", "Lol the only reason I ever moved my MIL stuff was on purpose because I knew it would irritate her. I was being immature and petty. Tell them to get a hotel room. NTA", "NTA in anyway shape or\nForm", "NTA\n\n> She told me she didn\u2019t like it so she fixed it.\n\nCalling her a nuisance is kindness.\n\nThat is entitled and rude when you are a guest in someone else\u2019s home. She owes you the apology here. \n\nShe\u2019s also *damaging* your home and property - that she has done this multiple times means her intent is irrelevant, she needs to recognize her limitations and ask before doing anything to your home.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t even trust her with a sponge unsupervised at this point.\n\nBut honestly just picking up after yourself and not making more of a mess is usually enough.", "NTA, but...\n\nShe may just honestly not *know* very basic life skills.  I had a buddy who was so coddled by his mom and hyper sexist dad that he didn't know how to use a microwave, stove, washer, dryer, mop, etc. until he was 21. He was never allowed to do \"women's\" work at home so this dude made it to college literally not being sble to microwave easy Mac. \n\nI would teach her how to do a thing ONCE. Do it with her.  Then, she can do it on her own.  If after that she still screws up, you'll know it's on purpose or she's terminally stupid.  But youre assuming this brand new adultish person has life skills. She may not.", "NTA - I would insist she pay for the damage she has caused (mirror and floor)", "NTA \n\nWho does that? Wow", "It used to be that not too bright people often were self-aware enough to know they have limits.\n\nI'm an atheist and I wouldn't have removed those crosses.and not just because I'd burst into flame.\n\nY'all's need a come to Jesus meeting where you tell her and your son what she's allowed to do and if that's not acceptable to them they're welcome to find other accommodations. I'd have a quote for the floor repair in hand and when they claim it was an accident agree and say, exactly, which is why we're not going to have any more.", "So your DIL thinks your house is literally her house to do with what she will? Unbelievable. \nGuests, like fish, begin to smell after three days. Ben Franklin", "My grandma, who is the epitome of the stereotypical horrible MIL, did that to my uncle's wife every time she came home from work. They lived above my grandparents in the same house, and when my aunt would come back from work, my grandma would always remake the bed with different covers, organise the kitchen into different drawers, hang the pictures somewhere else etc and then tell her \"my baby boy is used to it this way\". \n\nMy mum and dad lived further away so my mum didn't have it as bad, but one time she was visiting when my mum wasn't home and she put moss that she collected outside into all my mum's pots??? \n\nLiterally I am convinced these people do it on purpose. \n\nYou're NTA and I would've lost it after the stains on the wood floor.", "Get her out of your house before it escalates, there is something seriously wrong with her.", "NTA - I was ready to defend her until she started moving your stuff around. She needs to stay in her lane. Perhaps you can ask her to channel her inclination to help into cooking dinner or something.", "NTA. Time for them to move out. The mirror and floor are a problem even if she damaged them out of stupidity. The rearranged kitchen is just weird and a jerk move for sure. Taking all the crosses out of the room has to be malicious.", "NTA   omg I'd be LIVID at the cleaning alone.  The crosses?  What?????? Rearrange my kitchen and my foot would be up your ass!", "I think you should take your son aside and have a private chat with him. I think 2 months is way too long and if she's ruining your home and disrespecting boundaries that needs to be addressed. There needs to be a family discussion about boundaries, cleaning and finances. Are they contributing towards their stay or not?\n\n\nEspecially moving the crosses, put them back up asap and tell him it's not fair for her to disrespect your religion like that. You should not feel uncomfortable and unhappy in your own home.", "She's a problem. Your son is not going to see her as a problem because he's young and stupid but she is definitely a problem and most likely doing these things to see if your son will side with her when it blows up.", "They can live somewhere else. Maybe her parents will put up with this, since I assume that's where she learned it.\n\nI agree with your assessment. If you stayed with her for two months and moved all her stuff around, I would say the same to you.\n\nNTA", "NTA. They can both leave", "NTA Ask her to leave.", "NTA Kick them out. Son is getting laid and all is good in his world... but probably not after you went off on her so he doesn't give a crap if she messes world your up. With all your stories, no way can she be that oblivious. I can in no way see this as not malicious.", "NTA, Kick her out! She's doing that shit on purpose!", "NTA, not at all.  \nI don't know if \"medication\" is a legitimate excuse for this kind of behavior or not. Using harsh materials and destroying the finish seems more like overall carelessness. Removing all your crosses is more of a statement. It takes a incredible amount of nerve and a total lack of awareness to reorganize someone else's kitchen and rearrange the furniture.  \nFor your sake, I hope she doesn't come back!", "INFO: Is her name Kevin?", "NTA. If she wants to help to help there's plenty she can do without being disruptive, she can sweep or vacuum, she can do the dishes, she can put away the dishes, you know the basics to keep the house organized.

She is either dumb or she is trying to weaponized incompetence till the point she doesn't have to lift a finger for the remainder of her stay, cause you know she just does everything wrong.", "Nta she's not \"helping\", she's trying to make it her home to her preference and completely over stepping.", "NTA.

Wait until.they get a place then do it to her....", "NTA, but your DIL's intentions are not wrong. There is a communication issue here. \nYou can teach her how to clean mirror and other things,  may be she doesn't know and is only trying to help.

And if you need any help, you will ask her, but not to touch things without permission", "OK NTA, too much\n\nShe took down your crosses? have ya check to see if she's a vampire???\n\nAll kidding aside,  maybe the reason for her spectacular fail at cleaning is because she never had to do it when she was growing up, so she just doesn't know how to. .

You don't remove someone's decor when you are a guest even if it offends you.  She also sucks because you don't rearrange someone else's kitchen unless they hire you to do so.  \n\nYou suck because when she asked you if she could clean, you should have told her what cleaning supplies you wanted used and how to use them.  When my sons lived in college apts, they were given lists of cleaning products to be used on the various surfaces.  You didn't do this, so she went on tic tock or IG and got instructions from there. Yes, boiling water and tide is a big thing on there right now. She wants to be helpful and instead of nicely correcting her, you called her a nuisance.", "So ok you escalated the matter yourself instead of trying to educate someone, then got mad when that person followed your directions (but you obviously didn't mean THAT, right?)
