At best, she has extremely low self-esteem and felt disrespected when you didnt let her follow her diet plan. At worst, she has an eating disorder and there's more complicated mental mechanics which cause that reaction. Trying to force feed her isn't the answer, even when she really does need calories. ~~I would discuss these habits with friends of hers who you trust and stage an intervention~~ Scratch the intervention idea. Only consider that if it would help get your gf into therapy, which she should at least be considering.     \n    \nEdit: please note that I am very purposefully *not* diagnosing OP's gf with anything. My comment lays out best and worst case scenarios, but I am not saying definitively that OP's gf has an eating disorder. Skipping meals is a red flag for that possibility.", "NAH.\n\nI've been there. Back in high school, I calorie counted to try to lose weight. One day, I walked into the kitchen and noticed my mom was adding a high-calorie ingredient to our dinner that she didn't tell me about previously. I had a complete fucking meltdown.\n\nI had an eating disorder. And it sounds like your girlfriend is starting to develop one, too.\n\nIt was kind of you to try to help, but she needs professional help.", "Soft YTA. Giving her mac and cheese wasn't helpful or what she wanted. \n\nBut as another PCOSer, this is going to be a rough road. While some manage to control or lose weight, it's pretty well established that not only does PCOS make it easier to gain weight, it makes it harder to lose it and if someone is successful they tend to plateau faster. There's not much you can do. A lot of women try every diet plan under the sun, and it's very frustrating when they don't work, especially since everyone blames you for \"doing it wrong.\" I'd recommend a therapist, especially one who isn't focused on dieting.", "YTA at least educate yourself on PCOS if you want to support her. \n\nKraft dinner is the worst thing you can feed someone with PCOS.  \n\nIntermittent fasting when done right is actually a valid treatment for this condition.", "Soft YTA but mostly dropped in to say don\u2019t listen to anyone in this thread telling you the best diet/fast/weight loss solution. \n\nDieting is fucked in general. For your GF\u2019s self esteem, she should do therapy. If she wants to change her eating habits, try a dietician. If she wants to change her size, find a sport, exercise or trainer. That said, you can\u2019t do any of this for her. Good luck.", "NTA. You're showing concern for her health. Communication is key here; encourage her to seek professional advice. Approach the situation with sensitivity.", "she doesn\u2019t need you to feed her, she needs serious therapy and treatment for her eating disorder. it is not normal to get that upset about being served a meal you love. NTA for trying to help but you\u2019re 100% going about it the wrong way", "YTA. I get that you're concerned for your GF, but the truth is you aren't qualified to make that call. If you're really that concerned you should encourage her to seek out professional help from dieticians and nutritionists with the guidance of her doctor, and be there to support her new lifestyle. Otherwise, you're just going to make her issues much, much worse, no matter what your intentions are.", "NTA\n\nAnd your girlfriend needs to see a therapist.  \n\nThat said, next time if she says no to eating, just leave it be, despite your best intentions, it triggered her something fierce.\n\nAgain, your girlfriend needs to see a therapist.", "As someone who has lost a third of their body weight, I could give tons of tips. But the best advice is for your gf to see a dietitian to help manage her weight. Weight watchers won\u2019t help because PCOS can cause weight gain. She needs specialist medical advice. She also needs therapy to help with her disordered relationship to food (which she absolutely has if she\u2019s crying at Mac and cheese). But dietitian first!", "YTA. I understand your concern over her eating habits, but blatantly going against her wishes and trying to manipulate her into eating isn't going to help her at all. You need to sit her down and try and get her to see a counselor regarding her body image. Hopefully she is seeing a doctor regarding her PCOS.", "I would say NTA, as someone who also has pcos and is also very hard on myself with how I look/my weight. I understand how frustrating it can be to be in your position and to feel a little helpless, I also understand how hard it is for her. Having pcos makes it incredibly hard to lose weight, even if you do everything right. \nI developed a pretty severe ed because of it and ww can be a slippery slope into that if you're not careful. It sounds like she needs to see someone who she can talk to about this, be that someone a therapist or someone who specializes in helping women with pcos lose weight, or both. \n\nYou didn't do anything wrong, I've been in the same position and freaked out on my partner for the same thing. It can be overwhelming, and at least for me it made me feel guilty seeing my partner going out of their way to try and help when I really didn't want it. It's an incredibly difficult situation, just be extra patient with her, and maybe find a way to gently suggest therapy or something of the sort. Express that you're worried about her and you care for her and that skipping meals and starving herself is definitely not the way to go, doing it the healthy way isn't easy and it takes so much longer than it feels like it should, support her, be there for her. Give her extra compliments and some extra love.", "YTA. \nWhen someone is trying to lose weight, their decisions might seem a bit puzzling to you. Instead of insisting that they eat something they've been avoiding, it's helpful to take a more supportive approach. Encourage them to reach out to a nutritionist who can provide guidance. By doing so, you show that you're on their side and genuinely want to assist them in a safe and healthy way. It's important to respect their wishes and avoid pushing them into consuming something they consider unhealthy.", "YTA. PCOS comes with insulin resistance, and one of the methods used to fight insulin resistance is intermittent fasting (aka \"skipping meals\"). Why did you even mention the fact that she doesn't exercise much? So what? Exercise has a lot of benefit, but fat loss isn't really one of them. (AKA \"You can't outrun a bad diet.\")\n\nIntermittent fasting can be incredibly difficult, and having someone wave your favorite food in front of your face while you're trying to do it can be downright soul crushing. Total AH move.\n\nYour whole \"I just want her to be healthy\" sounds condescending AF after you said \"I stand by trying to feed her.\" You are not her doctor. Stop judging her so harshly and listen to her.", "YTA. She told you she didn't want to eat. Cooking for her and shoving food in her face is not the solution in this scenario. Even if she has an ED and needs help with it, she's still a full-fledged human being, not a child or an animal. And also sometimes not having dinner is fine, if she had something earlier", "YTA\n\nI agree that it sounds like your gf has low self esteem, which I sympathize with. However, 25 lbs in two years is a not insignificant weight gain, which she is justified to be concerned about.\n\nI'm not familiar with weight watchers' dietary recommendations, but I do know from personal experience losing weight that being hungry at the start is completely normal as your body adjusts to what a normal intake of calories is versus the overeating it was used to before. Had someone shoved junk food (which boxed mac & cheese absolutely is) in my face at the time, I would have been annoyed too.\n\nSkipping meals is also not inherently a bad thing. I often prefer fewer but larger meals, rather than lots of frequent smaller meals.\n\nIf you have legitimate concerns about her mental health, you will get much further by supporting her through understanding and shared goals, like proposing to exercise or cook together rather than shoving junk food in her face.", "NTA. But you need to do some research on PCOS safe foods if you are going to cook. If she isn't seeing one already, an endocrinologist might be able to help her get a hold of some of those symptoms.\n\n\nEdit: maybe have her check out r/PCOS", "YTA, you did a VERY manipulative thing that she asked you not to do.", "YTA For triggering her, you shouldn't have done that without her consent. As for the dieting, she might wanna follow the 8 on 16 off method. 8 hours window where she can eat, and then 16 hours off (most of that is her sleeping, so it's not like she's going all day without eating). Fasting can be good, but it's more effective when your eating habits are regulated. Also, doesn't WW send meal planning tools?", "YTA. You are not a dietician and have no place telling her how she should eat, especially if you are offering her unhealthy food. \n\nContrary to what people are saying here, skipping meals is NOT an eating disorder. Prolonged episodes of fasting followed by binging, purging, or extreme calorie cutting leading to weight loss over three pounds a week are all examples of eating disorders. Limiting your eating window to only one or two meals a day is a perfectly acceptable way of creating a calorie deficit. As long as that deficit is not excessive (and I imagine it is not because she\u2019s using weight watchers, which isn\u2019t the best but it\u2019s not going to set exceeding calorie restriction goals) then she is not doing anything unhealthy. She\u2019s actually doing exactly what she should be doing. \n\nBut she\u2019s \u201cstarving\u201d you say. Ya, because cutting calories is extremely hard for someone with PCOS. Her hormones are telling her to eat all the time. It\u2019s  very hard for her to make healthy choices right now. That\u2019s the language she\u2019s using to communicate how hard she\u2019s working. It doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s being unhealthy. \n\nShe\u2019s trying to tell you this, and you\u2019re not listening to her. At least get educated about healthy weight loss if you\u2019re going to insist on making her eat things.", "NTA.  \n\n\nYou were concerned and trying to help.  Have you considered entering into an exercise routine with her?  My sister and I, and alternately my old boyfriend and I, used to work out together and it was a blast.", "YTA, your friend was interested enough to accept and tag along to see what it was all about, not be told to do things by you and the other people when she got there. Maybe lead by example next time, show her the ropes but don\u2019t immediately try  and use someone like a worker bee. Your friend is also an asshole for using the middle finger though", "NTA, you're connsered for her, and that's super sweet. Being someone who is dealing with the struggle of losing weight myself. She needs to be told that having a \"cheat\" day will help her stay on track. She can eat her weight in green leafy veggies and lean proteins. Depriving herself of food won't help in the long run. And depriving herself of food she enjoys will end badly for her goals.\n\n\nHave her pick 1 day a week. That will be her cheat day. She can eat whatever she likes for 1, maybe 2 meals on that day.\n\nStock up on leafy green veggies and lean meats (if yall eat meat). Leafy green veggies have almost no calories or carbs. Your body can burn the very small amount of calories off by just existing.\n\nProtine bars are useful when trying to make it past the \"I'm starving I need food NOW\" moments.\n\nLook at the back of boxes and food items, and check the carb count over the calorie. Carbs turn to sugar in your body and store easier as fat.\n\nHope these tips help", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Why do you insist on serving her unhealthy food when she's trying to lose weight? This makes me think you just don't want to change YOUR unhealthy eating habits. Maybe you're insecure about your own weight ?\n\nTey to support her. With weight watchers, there are things she can eat without losing points (e.g. most fruits and vegetables).", "I agree with most of what you\u2019ve said, except the part about staging an intervention with friends. GF might react poorly to that \u2014 feeling embarrassed/judged/misunderstood/defensive/etc. \n\nRecommending she seek professional support is probably a better option. If OP fears she\u2019d be resistant to the idea of therapy, maybe suggesting she consult a dietician or nutritionist would be a good first step. Ideally, they will help her work on her relationship with food. \n\nFWIW, I tracked macros for about 9 months under the guidance of a nutritionist, with the goal of losing weight, and one of my biggest sub-goals starting out was actually to make sure I ate ENOUGH calories every day. It might seem counterintuitive, but eating \u201cmore\u201d consistently was \u2014 for me \u2014 much more effective in the long term than trying to just restrict in the short term.\n\n(Also! I don\u2019t think tracking macros or calories is a great idea for everyone, or even most people \u2014 you have to really see the numbers as data, and not assign any sort of value or moral judgment to them. Unfortunately, due to the way society in general treats weight/food/nutrition/size, this is hard for a lot of people. Tracking can be really triggering, which I totally understand.)", "> She started crying, got hysterical, and ran out of my house and drove home. \n\nYeah, this is definitely disordered behavior.

Exercise creates muscle. Muscle helps burn fat. Muscle also weighs more than fat so even if the scales don't change much your clothes will still start getting looser. \n\nSecond YES intermittent fasting can be very useful (as is the keto diet) however this doesn't sound like a healthy intermittent fasting. You time those. You have a certain preplanned time where you eat.

You made a mistake with the mac and cheese and won't do that again.", "YTA.\n\nShe is trying to lose weight and you are trying to give her Mac and Cheese. If she is doing weight watchers and counting her calories, she is doing the right thing. \n\nIt sucks dieting, it sucks being hungry, but thats the price you pay to get to a healthy weight after you ate too much for too long. She isnt going to die from skipping a few meals", "YTA. She\u2019s struggling so you went and got something that\u2019s all carbs and fat? Why would you do that? She needs professional help. Not a partner who ignores her words.", "Feed her a salad, not macaroni and cheese. It is just empty carbs...You are sobotaging her. Let her figure it out herself. YTA", "NAH I guess. Your intentions were good but you went too far. She seems to be in need of therapy. WW does not advocate for skipping meals.  \n\n\nI would suggest a \"I'm sorry I'm just worried\" carepackage : vitamins, powerade zero, maybe some nice lotion (notion \"anti-aging\" or \"fat burning\"), and a offer to keep her prefered fresh fruit in your fridge at all time (idk like rapsberries are low calories and better than nothing).  \n\n\nReassure her that you love her at whatever size she is, that you understand she's worried and you are willing to support her, but that you are uncomfortable with her skipping meals and you don't want her to suffer from ED.", "NTA, but your girlfriend needs to work with a registered dietician on her weight if shes worried about it as having pcos has very specific dietary needs, not hip hop around trying to diy a solution with disordered eating and one of the most notorious diet plans for encouraging disordered eating.", "NAH  I was 17 when I was diagnosed with PCOS. I\u2019m 43 now and it\u2019s been a long struggle to get right in my head.\n\nYour girlfriend is scared and there\u2019s a lot of terrible symptoms that can arise the more weight you put on. I totally understand why you thought making her favourite meal would get her to eat and maybe improve her outlook, but I\u2019m sure she\u2019s already realized that some of her favourite foods are no longer appropriate for her condition and that can be really upsetting on its own. \n\nWhen I was diagnosed I went through a bunch of medication changes that made me pretty hormonal and there wasn\u2019t a lot of good information on how to treat the condition 30 years ago.\n\nThe best way to support her is to learn as much as you can about PCOS and support any healthy decisions she makes. There are a bunch of really great PCOS nutritionists that have communities and they can be really supportive. There is even a fellow on the tiktok that you may want to follow, his wife has PCOS and he took it on as a huge learning experience and has great advice for women and their support systems.\n\nPersonally I went through some therapy for my body issues, but it might be a little soon to approach that. I think she likely needs to get her medication stabilized first. \n\nBest wishes for you both \u2764\ufe0f", "YTA it is not unhealthy to skip some meals (read studies!) but it is hard. You are doing the opposite of helping her.", "I've also got PCOS. She needs to see a dietician under her doctor's orders and work out a healthy food plan. Skipping meals to stay within WW points isn't a good long term solution. Neither is trying to get her to eat high calorie comfort foods.\n\nYTA.", "NTA ruuuun she\u2019ll pass this on to your children. I speak from experience. Run boy run.", "NTA - You are worried for her health I get it. The only reason you would be an ah is if you lied to her about what is in her food or snuck calories too her.\n\nTell her to check out slimming world instead. I've not done WW myself but SW focuses on feeling full, eating the right things like veggies, fruit and protein while also not limiting carbs. The idea is you eat until you are full and then stop. If you are hungry later each something else. You CAN have comfort foods on a diet you just need to incorporate it into a healthy diet. I lost three stone in three months but I did have a lot to lose, and still do however it works and I wasn't hungry or skipping meals. She also doesn't HAVE to exercise to lose weight, it's 80% diet 20% exercise. Moving is good but if you feed yourself junk it won't work.  \n\n\nCutting meals will ultimately freak your body out and then it'll hold onto any fat / calories much more because it's going to go into starvation mode. This also makes your body horde and crave fat to 'store' for the starvation she's doing. It's why fasting is a little silly to me.   \n\n\nShe needs therapy though I think before any diet will work. Maybe if you joined a group with her, did the diet with her it could go a little ways to a) understanding what point system is being used do you can meal plan and cook around it b) make her feel supported and heard which puts her in a better mental space generally.", "NAH. You are genuinely concerned and it sounds like you are right to be. Sadly, your gf sounds like she may have disordered eating or an eating disorder. I would have a talk with her about your concerns while also letting her know that you are there to support her become healthy (which may not include weight loss).", "Intervention????? Seriously?? Poor girl has PCOS which often leads to uncontrollable weight gain. She needs doctors and therapy, not friends who don\u2019t know wtf they\u2019re talking about. \n\nOf course she\u2019s losing her mind over gaining so much weight and not being able to control it.", "Irony: weight watchers has no forbidden foods. And they have flex points. She CAN eat the macaroni.  NTA", "I have PCOS too. And for a while I controlled everything I ate. Little to no sugar, junk food, fast food, oily foods, etc. my diet consisted of brown bread, nuts, eggs, and fruits and vegetables. \nBut this ended up severely depressing me. It\u2019s also important to note that I was 15/16, so when all my friends could eat all the unhealthy food in the world, I had to check my blood sugar levels and ensure I ate healthy.\n\nDespite all this I barely lost any weight. Maybe 1-2 kgs in the span of a year. Which\u2026 sucks, to say the least.\n\nNowadays I don\u2019t control my diet as much. I eat more freely, and while it isn\u2019t a \u201chealthy\u201d lifestyle, it\u2019s not like I\u2019m eating only junk either. My cysts are gone too, so while I do have PCOS, it\u2019s a lot more controlled now.\n\nI hope OP\u2019s gf finds some confidence in herself. But OP is definitely NTA. Whatever severe diet she chooses to follow, it\u2019s going to be difficult to follow in the long term. She needs to learn to balance the way she eats\u2026 starving herself is not the way. Hopefully she goes to therapy and gets professional help.", "This is the big takeaway. OP is concerned and trying to take care of their girlfriend. But you can't fix an eating disorder by cooking someone their favorite food. That's just not gonna help as well intentioned as it may be.", "This. Another PCOSer here. She is already going to struggle with weight gain, and to give her a former, very bad comfort food under the guise of concern for not eating is not helping. She is going to need support and those who will understand she will likely have extreme dietary needs for the majority of her life. Help her regain control with proper nutritional and emotional support. Learn about what those dietary needs are; get those foods on hand for her.", "Yeah a lot of people diagnosing an eating disorder to someone who sounds like they just got a frustrating diagnosis and are trying to figure out their diet moving forward to have the body they want. Nobody has ever starved from skipping a meal and Mac and cheese I. Your face when you\u2019re struggling to regulate your diet in the face of a hormonal weight gain situation is like a slap in the face. Leave her alone and if you\u2019re concerned just apologize and tell her let\u2019s make healthy dinners together this week I want to support you.", "Lol what? Exercise does burn fat. You're supposed to balance exercising with your meals. \n\nAfter I got diagnosed with PCOS, my doctor emphasised on exercising, be it going for a walk or jog or hitting the gym. \n\nI was also given a diet plan. My doctor didn't want me skipping meals but she told me to cut out all junk food, eat only two cups of steamed rice for heavy meals, avoid all dairy products, eat steamed vegetables and meat, avoid fatty and spicy food. She told me to follow this diet for 3 months. I did manage to lose a lot of weight in the 3 months (10 kgs). PCOS has been giving me less trouble since.", "That's not quite true with PCOS, since it's a complex hormonal condition that often comes with insulin resistance, exercise actually helps massively with that", "Yes, she has PCOS. That doesn't mean that skipping meals is a good idea. Sure, an intervention may not be best after all, but I don't think the suggestion warrants this reaction. Interventions are done out of love and concern for someone, not judgement.", "She can eat the macaroni with WW but if she's been diagnosed with PCOS she will have been told to follow a low carb diet - so definitely not macaroni.\n\nI think OP and his gf need to communicate more about what foods will work - not her \"no food at all\" approach, but not his (albeit well-intentioned) \"here's a bowl of carbs\" approach.", "> ETA shame on all the comments giving diet advice. Giving diet advice based on a 3rd party account of an online stranger who seems like they're headed for an ED is wrong on so many levels.\n\nOmg no kidding", "Going to add here as a fellow PCOS sufferer: with PCOS you are specifically advised to follow a low carb diet. \n\nWhile it sounds like OP's gf is going to extremes and starving herself, I have to say that when I first went low carb if my husband had given me a big bowl of macaroni cheese (which I absolutely love but is one of the worst things to eat) I too would probably have burst into tears.", "Seriously that would be such a mind fuck to me", "Intermittent fasting and OMAD are legitimate types of diet though", "Skipping meals is not problematic if a person is still eating the amount of calories they need to function.  I skip meals when I'm not hungry.  But I usually make up for it by eating a little extra in the next meal.  It isn't that big of a deal.  \n\nThe OP is TA not because he offered her food, but because he offered *that* food.  I mean, she's trying to do better with her diet and he gets boxed mac and cheese?  This screams \"sabotage\" to me.  Even if she is getting carried away with her new diet, what did he think her response was going to be?  Gratitude that he's clearly not supportive?  He could have offered her a nice salad or a bowl of soup.  But he went for bottom shelf comfort food.  Not cool.", "A bowl of carbs mixed with butter and cheese, no less.\n\nYou should have offered something lighter and actually more nutritious if you wanted it to go over well. \n\nAlso kind of alarmed at all the people calling this an eating disorder, or low self esteem, or anything else.\n\nAll we KNOW is GF wants to lose weight, has a plan she\u2019s sticking to, and OP (albeit well intentioned) tried to sabotage her.\n\nTry seeing things from her point of view, Jesus.", "Skipping meals makes it worse, isn't weight watchers OR low carb. It is nice and manipulative, though, when she's distressing him to the point he's desperate for her to eat ANYTHING and then goes all silent. And yeah, I fully get pcos. And you DON'T get a get out of exercise free card if you're actually dealing with it.", "Yeah or are it all and purged. OP doesn\u2019t seem to understand how much they are already in disordered eating land. \n\nShe doesn\u2019t need her fave foods; she needs professional help.", "OK but OP said she's \"skipping meals to meet the daily goals\". That doesn't sound like intermittent fasting or OMAD, it sounds like skipping meals instead of figuring out how to meet the goals by changing meals.", "Those techniques are only going to be healthy if the person using them is completely on top of their mental relationship with food and with a psychology demonstrated by the OP GF, there's a 97% chance this is a disordered way of eating.", "For me personally, the best/worst case scenarios mainly came from the part about skipping meals. Weight Watchers is fine, choosing to eat only specific things is fine, but skipping meals can definitely be a red flag.", "Intermittent fasting is a valid (and proven healthy) method of assisting with weight-loss. Mac and cheese is a proven un-healthy method of assisting with weight-gain. \nExercise helps only a little with weight-loss (not to say it isn\u2019t a good idea). \n\nOP obviously doesn\u2019t trust his GF to make the right choices about her own (adult) body and is sabotaging her efforts.", "Everyone thinks they're doing the right thing most of the time. Most bad shit that's ever been done was done with good intentions lmao", "Intermittent fasting is NOT skipping meals. It's very timed and deliberate and is almost always done in accordance with proper eating plan and exercise. I don't want to go over each point but he didn't offer the macaroni until after offering her many other foods, he went and got it in a desperate attempt to get her to eat something, anything. That's not sabotage, it's care and concern, and framing it as sabotage is... I'm gonna stop there. It's very not nice to frame something that is clearly concern as sabotage. May your own motives never be twisted against you."]}
