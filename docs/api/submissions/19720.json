At best, she has extremely low self-esteem and felt disrespected when you didnt let her follow her diet plan. At worst, she has an eating disorder and there's more complicated mental mechanics which cause that reaction. Trying to force feed her isn't the answer, even when she really does need calories. I would discuss these habits with friends of hers who you trust and stage an intervention.", "NAH.\n\nI've been there. Back in high school, I calorie counted to try to lose weight. One day, I walked into the kitchen and noticed my mom was adding a high-calorie ingredient to our dinner that she didn't tell me about previously. I had a complete fucking meltdown.\n\nI had an eating disorder. And it sounds like your girlfriend is starting to develop one, too.\n\nIt was kind of you to try to help, but she needs professional help.", "Soft YTA. Giving her mac and cheese wasn't helpful or what she wanted. \n\nBut as another PCOSer, this is going to be a rough road. While some manage to control or lose weight, it's pretty well established that not only does PCOS make it easier to gain weight, it makes it harder to lose it and if someone is successful they tend to plateau faster. There's not much you can do. A lot of women try every diet plan under the sun, and it's very frustrating when they don't work, especially since everyone blames you for \"doing it wrong.\" I'd recommend a therapist, especially one who isn't focused on dieting.", "YTA at least educate yourself on PCOS if you want to support her. \n\nKraft dinner is the worst thing you can feed someone with PCOS.  \n\nIntermittent fasting when done right is actually a valid treatment for this condition.", "Soft YTA but mostly dropped in to say don\u2019t listen to anyone in this thread telling you the best diet/fast/weight loss solution. \n\nDieting is fucked in general. For your GF\u2019s self esteem, she should do therapy. If she wants to change her eating habits, try a dietician. If she wants to change her size, find a sport, exercise or trainer. That said, you can\u2019t do any of this for her. Good luck.", "NTA. You're showing concern for her health. Communication is key here; encourage her to seek professional advice. Approach the situation with sensitivity.", "she doesn\u2019t need you to feed her, she needs serious therapy and treatment for her eating disorder. it is not normal to get that upset about being served a meal you love. NTA for trying to help but you\u2019re 100% going about it the wrong way", "YTA. I get that you're concerned for your GF, but the truth is you aren't qualified to make that call. If you're really that concerned you should encourage her to seek out professional help from dieticians and nutritionists with the guidance of her doctor, and be there to support her new lifestyle. Otherwise, you're just going to make her issues much, much worse, no matter what your intentions are.", "NTA\n\nAnd your girlfriend needs to see a therapist.  \n\nThat said, next time if she says no to eating, just leave it be, despite your best intentions, it triggered her something fierce.\n\nAgain, your girlfriend needs to see a therapist.", "As someone who has lost a third of their body weight, I could give tons of tips. But the best advice is for your gf to see a dietitian to help manage her weight. Weight watchers won\u2019t help because PCOS can cause weight gain. She needs specialist medical advice. She also needs therapy to help with her disordered relationship to food (which she absolutely has if she\u2019s crying at Mac and cheese). But dietitian first!", "YTA. I understand your concern over her eating habits, but blatantly going against her wishes and trying to manipulate her into eating isn't going to help her at all. You need to sit her down and try and get her to see a counselor regarding her body image. Hopefully she is seeing a doctor regarding her PCOS.", "I would say NTA, as someone who also has pcos and is also very hard on myself with how I look/my weight. I understand how frustrating it can be to be in your position and to feel a little helpless, I also understand how hard it is for her. Having pcos makes it incredibly hard to lose weight, even if you do everything right. \nI developed a pretty severe ed because of it and ww can be a slippery slope into that if you're not careful. It sounds like she needs to see someone who she can talk to about this, be that someone a therapist or someone who specializes in helping women with pcos lose weight, or both. \n\nYou didn't do anything wrong, I've been in the same position and freaked out on my partner for the same thing. It can be overwhelming, and at least for me it made me feel guilty seeing my partner going out of their way to try and help when I really didn't want it. It's an incredibly difficult situation, just be extra patient with her, and maybe find a way to gently suggest therapy or something of the sort. Express that you're worried about her and you care for her and that skipping meals and starving herself is definitely not the way to go, doing it the healthy way isn't easy and it takes so much longer than it feels like it should, support her, be there for her. Give her extra compliments and some extra love.", "YTA. \nWhen someone is trying to lose weight, their decisions might seem a bit puzzling to you. Instead of insisting that they eat something they've been avoiding, it's helpful to take a more supportive approach. Encourage them to reach out to a nutritionist who can provide guidance. By doing so, you show that you're on their side and genuinely want to assist them in a safe and healthy way. It's important to respect their wishes and avoid pushing them into consuming something they consider unhealthy.", "YTA. PCOS comes with insulin resistance, and one of the methods used to fight insulin resistance is intermittent fasting (aka \"skipping meals\"). Why did you even mention the fact that she doesn't exercise much? So what? Exercise has a lot of benefit, but fat loss isn't really one of them. (AKA \"You can't outrun a bad diet.\")\n\nIntermittent fasting can be incredibly difficult, and having someone wave your favorite food in front of your face while you're trying to do it can be downright soul crushing. Total AH move.\n\nYour whole \"I just want her to be healthy\" sounds condescending AF after you said \"I stand by trying to feed her.\" You are not her doctor. Stop judging her so harshly and listen to her.", "YTA. She told you she didn't want to eat. Cooking for her and shoving food in her face is not the solution in this scenario. Even if she has an ED and needs help with it, she's still a full-fledged human being, not a child or an animal. And also sometimes not having dinner is fine, if she had something earlier", "YTA\n\nI agree that it sounds like your gf has low self esteem, which I sympathize with. However, 25 lbs in two years is a not insignificant weight gain, which she is justified to be concerned about.\n\nI'm not familiar with weight watchers' dietary recommendations, but I do know from personal experience losing weight that being hungry at the start is completely normal as your body adjusts to what a normal intake of calories is versus the overeating it was used to before. Had someone shoved junk food (which boxed mac & cheese absolutely is) in my face at the time, I would have been annoyed too.\n\nSkipping meals is also not inherently a bad thing. I often prefer fewer but larger meals, rather than lots of frequent smaller meals.\n\nIf you have legitimate concerns about her mental health, you will get much further by supporting her through understanding and shared goals, like proposing to exercise or cook together rather than shoving junk food in her face.", "NTA. But you need to do some research on PCOS safe foods if you are going to cook. If she isn't seeing one already, an endocrinologist might be able to help her get a hold of some of those symptoms.\n\n\nEdit: maybe have her check out r/PCOS", "YTA, you did a VERY manipulative thing that she asked you not to do.", "YTA For triggering her, you shouldn't have done that without her consent. As for the dieting, she might wanna follow the 8 on 16 off method. 8 hours window where she can eat, and then 16 hours off (most of that is her sleeping, so it's not like she's going all day without eating). Fasting can be good, but it's more effective when your eating habits are regulated. Also, doesn't WW send meal planning tools?", "YTA. You are not a dietician and have no place telling her how she should eat, especially if you are offering her unhealthy food. \n\nContrary to what people are saying here, skipping meals is NOT an eating disorder. Prolonged episodes of fasting followed by binging, purging, or extreme calorie cutting leading to weight loss over three pounds a week are all examples of eating disorders. Limiting your eating window to only one or two meals a day is a perfectly acceptable way of creating a calorie deficit. As long as that deficit is not excessive (and I imagine it is not because she\u2019s using weight watchers, which isn\u2019t the best but it\u2019s not going to set exceeding calorie restriction goals) then she is not doing anything unhealthy. She\u2019s actually doing exactly what she should be doing. \n\nBut she\u2019s \u201cstarving\u201d you say. Ya, because cutting calories is extremely hard for someone with PCOS. Her hormones are telling her to eat all the time. It\u2019s  very hard for her to make healthy choices right now. That\u2019s the language she\u2019s using to communicate how hard she\u2019s working. It doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s being unhealthy. \n\nShe\u2019s trying to tell you this, and you\u2019re not listening to her. At least get educated about healthy weight loss if you\u2019re going to insist on making her eat things.", "NTA.  \n\n\nYou were concerned and trying to help.  Have you considered entering into an exercise routine with her?  My sister and I, and alternately my old boyfriend and I, used to work out together and it was a blast.", "YTA, your friend was interested enough to accept and tag along to see what it was all about, not be told to do things by you and the other people when she got there. Maybe lead by example next time, show her the ropes but don\u2019t immediately try  and use someone like a worker bee. Your friend is also an asshole for using the middle finger though", "NTA, you're connsered for her, and that's super sweet. Being someone who is dealing with the struggle of losing weight myself. She needs to be told that having a \"cheat\" day will help her stay on track. She can eat her weight in green leafy veggies and lean proteins. Depriving herself of food won't help in the long run. And depriving herself of food she enjoys will end badly for her goals.\n\n\nHave her pick 1 day a week. That will be her cheat day. She can eat whatever she likes for 1, maybe 2 meals on that day.\n\nStock up on leafy green veggies and lean meats (if yall eat meat). Leafy green veggies have almost no calories or carbs. Your body can burn the very small amount of calories off by just existing.\n\nProtine bars are useful when trying to make it past the \"I'm starving I need food NOW\" moments.\n\nLook at the back of boxes and food items, and check the carb count over the calorie. Carbs turn to sugar in your body and store easier as fat.\n\nHope these tips help", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Each person's relationship with food and body image is deeply personal and sensitive, and it's essential to approach these topics with empathy and understanding.\n\nYour girlfriend's reaction suggests that she may be struggling with her body image and eating habits on a deeper level, and your attempt to offer her macaroni and cheese could have been perceived as dismissive of her concerns and struggles.\n\nInstead of making decisions about her food intake without her input, it would be more beneficial to have an open and honest conversation about her feelings, concerns, and goals regarding her health talk about what type of food should would like to eat- I have a cashew \u201ccheese\u201d sauce that\u2019s fantastic with Mac. \n\nIn this situation, it's important to acknowledge your girlfriend's emotions, apologize for any distress caused, and express your willingness to be supportive in a way that aligns with her needs and wishes.

She\u2019s probably got or is developing an eating disorder. If you legitimately thought she was starving, I get where you were coming from, and it wasn\u2019t from a place of bad intention.

She had a panic attack just from the thought and stress of \u201ccheating\u201d her new diet. Which is off to a veryyyyy bad start. Help her get help. Dietician, nutritionist, therapist, whichever\u2026 but also plenty, and I mean plentyyy, of research.", "YTA.  Trying to get someone to eat is unsupportive and not the way to ever approach someone with an ED.  FYI - boxed macaroni is not healthy.  There are plenty of people that skip meals and are healthy.  Your opinions about food and health seem oddly skewed in the wrong direction, so you may want to stop judging her.  Maybe try supporting her in a healthy manner.  Make her feel good about herself, compliment her, not just on physical traits, but knowledge, intelligence, any special skills she has, etc.", "NTA She was hangry and in a self-hating mood too. She just needed your support. You just gave her a different kind than she needed. Next time, get her a glass of water and ask what else you can do to help", "YTA. Why do you insist on serving her unhealthy food when she's trying to lose weight? This makes me think you just don't want to change YOUR unhealthy eating habits. Maybe you're insecure about your own weight ?\n\nTey to support her. With weight watchers, there are things she can eat without losing points (e.g. most fruits and vegetables).", "I agree with most of what you\u2019ve said, except the part about staging an intervention with friends. GF might react poorly to that \u2014 feeling embarrassed/judged/misunderstood/defensive/etc. \n\nRecommending she seek professional support is probably a better option. If OP fears she\u2019d be resistant to the idea of therapy, maybe suggesting she consult a dietician or nutritionist would be a good first step. Ideally, they will help her work on her relationship with food. \n\nFWIW, I tracked macros for about 9 months under the guidance of a nutritionist, with the goal of losing weight, and one of my biggest sub-goals starting out was actually to make sure I ate ENOUGH calories every day. It might seem counterintuitive, but eating \u201cmore\u201d consistently was \u2014 for me \u2014 much more effective in the long term than trying to just restrict in the short term.\n\n(Also! I don\u2019t think tracking macros or calories is a great idea for everyone, or even most people \u2014 you have to really see the numbers as data, and not assign any sort of value or moral judgment to them. Unfortunately, due to the way society in general treats weight/food/nutrition/size, this is hard for a lot of people. Tracking can be really triggering, which I totally understand.)", "> She started crying, got hysterical, and ran out of my house and drove home. \n\nYeah, this is definitely disordered behavior. I'm obviously not diagnosing someone over the internet but that's not healthy. OP, maybe call an eating disorder hotline to learn about what might be the best way to support her?\n\nETA shame on all the comments giving diet advice.

Exercise creates muscle. Muscle helps burn fat. Muscle also weighs more than fat so even if the scales don't change much your clothes will still start getting looser. \n\nSecond YES intermittent fasting can be very useful (as is the keto diet) however this doesn't sound like a healthy intermittent fasting. You time those. You have a certain preplanned time where you eat. I.e. an 8 hour window each day, or some people will fast in tune with our old biology (I.e. fast more in the winter than summer etc.) \n\nThird, when someone is in the throws of an eating disorder they aren't thinking about what's best they're focused solely on losing weight, even when they lose weight they can't just stop.
