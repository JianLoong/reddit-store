The cat is literally not letting you sleep, heck the cat isn't sleeping itself. Your dog is doing nothing to disturb anyone. So of course the cat gets banned from the room for the night. And him trying to tit for tat with your dog makes him sound really petty.", "NTA\n\nAnd I\u2019m typing this with a cat in my lap.\n\nAnyway, you guys established rules for the pets before moving in.  His cat is disrupting your sleep.  Your dog isn\u2019t.  You want to ban his cat from the bedroom at night.  He wants to inflict the same punishment on your dog because \u201cit\u2019s only fair\u201d.  I think the real reason he wants to bend the rules on this one case has to do with \u201cif I\u2019m not allowed to have my cat, you shouldn\u2019t be allowed to have your dog\u201d.\n\nCats are going to do just what the hell they want.  The zoomies from the cat are normal.  Banning the cat from the bedroom will give the cat more room to zoom.  If the cat has anything it needs (litter box, food or water) in the bedroom, move it before you lock the door.", "\"Either I'm sleeping in bed with you or the cat is. I don't care which it is at this point, so make a choice.\"   \nNTA.", "NTA   I'll be the odd vote.   The two of you made a rule not to punish the \"other\" pet. He's breaking that rule. That's your first issue.  The second and major one is he doesn't seem to care that his cat is sitting on your face. Kitty needs to sleep elsewhere.  Kitty is not a human and doesn't have the right to sit on your face while you try to sleep.  Kitty will be just fine locked in a kitty prison if need be.  I like my sleep can you tell?  \n\n\nI love our animals.  I have this psycho tiny dog that was horribly abused before we adopted her and she slept in my armpit for the last 7 years. She's afraid of everyone & everything.  Just last month she began sleeping stretched out, touching my husband with her little paws.  He was so excited it was laughable.  Our other dog has to sleep in the other room because he \"talks\" & snores in his sleep.  I love him dearly but he's in the other room.  He's fine.  He's happy.    \n\n\nOur cats and the racoon sleep in a separate room from everyone else because they try to party all night.  Racoons are incredible little cabinet openers. And one cat knows how to turn on the stereo.  They are in prison at night.\n\nBuy yourself some earplugs because kitty is going to scream all night and sing the songs of the Cat People.", "Easy NTA, you had an agreement lol. Like.... there's an objective answer to this, because it's clearly defined in the rules y'all agreed to. It's also not harmful to either animal, is beneficial to you and your partner will get to learn not to be a big baby about it. A win-win-win.", "NTA\n\nI have a kitten that does the exact same thing! \nLuckily I have a separate room to keep him in with his bed and whenever I come out in the middle of the night he's always always sleeping on his bed.", "NTA idk why everyone is flipping out about this. the dog is doing nothing wrong, cat is.", "NTA\n\nCats are notoriously annoying at night. I'm sure the cat is going to be absolutely fine sleeping on the couch at night", "Cats are way worse than dogs in bed.", "Your dog doesn't even sleep on your bed normally. Just send both the animals out there so they have eachother and neither are lonely.", "NTA.  This fight seems pretty ridiculous.  The dog doesn't cause a problem.  The cat does.   Regardless, go ahead and let the cat in the bedroom at night.\n\nMy cat liked to annoyingly lay right in the other side of my back when I'm on my side in bed.   A few rollovers onto the cat taught it not to be there anymore.  It also loved to wake me up at 2 in the morning for food by getting in my face and meowing.  Several shoves off the bed taught it to wait until the morning.\n\nDo something similar.  You don't have to be super mean, but cats do learn.   Also, if the cat is waking you up by getting on your face,  pick it up and put it on your BF's face (who I assume is sleeping through this), making sure to wake him up.   If the cat has the zoomies and tears through the room at 3am waking you up,  give the BF a big poke to make sure he's up and tell him why.   Basically every way the cat wakes you up,  shove it off the bed or onto your boyfriend and make sure he get's woken up too.   It'll learn to avoid you (and one hopes that some rational thought will creep into your BF)\n\nIn terms of the disparity of rules between the two pets... there is not a big enough eyeroll emoticon for this.  \"Its not fair\".... lord...  When the next fight occurs, tell him how blissful the night would be if the cat wasn't allowed in the room and/or at least admit there are some differences between species of animals. Reasonable people will realize that different animals will need to be treated differently.  I mean, if all animals have to have the same \"rules\",  do you have to train the dog to shit in a litter box?  Can't be treating animals differently!  Should they have the exact same food?   Does the cat have to learn to play fetch?   if you had a bird, would this mean that both the cat and the dog would also have to live in birdcages?", "NTA. I have 2 cats and previously lived with a partner that had a dog. The dog slept in our room and the cats had the rest of the house. When I lived on my own my bedroom door would be open so they could come in if they chose to.

Our dog sleeps in our room with us, on his bed on the floor. He patiently and quietly sleeps through the night waiting for us to get up before he gets up.
