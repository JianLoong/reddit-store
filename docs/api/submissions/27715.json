{"id": 27715, "submission_id": "16tcza6", "title": "AITA for calling my parents insensitive and telling them they managed to take things so far they are beyond repair?", "selftext": "I (25F) have an older brother, Nick (38M). Nick was married to his childhood sweetheart Cassie until her death 10 years ago. They had two children together. Cassie was a beloved member of our family. She was essentially my sister because I grew up knowing her and she was awesome. My brother loved her so much too.\n\nNick never dated or had a romantic relationship after Cassie died. He has always appeared happy to me. Maybe not the same kind of happy that he was with Cassie, but happy all the same. He focuses on different things other than relationships. Which is something that bothers our parents. Two years after Cassie died they started suggesting my brother could leave the kids with them and go out to meet some women. They introduced him to women they thought would be a good match for him, including some widows. My brother told them he was not interested in dating and he would appreciate it if they didn't push. My parents never stopped pushing and over the years they have strained their relationship with Nick and my nephews. About a year ago my nephews said their dad didn't need to have a woman to be a good dad, my parents suggested their lives would be better with a mom for the boys and a wife for Nick and that he would have an easier time parenting, and did they ever stop to think their mom was impossible to match for their dad. They also told my parents that they never ever wanted a new mom and that they hated the assumption otherwise, an assumption my parents often brought up.\n\nI have spoken to my brother and to the boys. I support them and they talk to me sometimes. It can be good for them to get it all out. I have also told my parents to back off in the past and pointed out that Nick is happy. They don't listen to me or care to hear me speak on it.\n\nMy brother took time from our parents and our parents grew tired of this. So a few days ago my parents decided to show up at my brother's house, while I was there, and they told him it's unhealthy to not have moved on into a new relationship. They said if Cassie had been such a terrible wife, his marriage that bad or if she had made him promise to never find another partner then he should find a way to get over it and move on. My brother kicked them out and told them he never wanted to see them again.\n\nMy parents decided to complain about it to me. I told them they had always been insensitive when it came to my brother's love life after Cassie but they had taken things way too far this last time and there was no repairing things. I told them it was disgusting to shit all over Cassie just because my brother didn't want to continue the life the way they wanted. They said I didn't care about my brother's happiness and didn't even try to see their side. Yesterday they said I was rude and it was uncalled for.

The reason I am questioning my decision is they were already pissy about my brother and things were already tense. My decisions to say this to them did not make things better. In fact, it might make them feel attacked and double down which is not the ideal at all.

You did the right thing calling them out on their behavior.", "NTA Ironic that they're telling you that you don't care about his happiness when they've been so horrible he had to kick them out of his life. They need a wake up call and it's nice of you to try but it sounds like they are too far gone.", "NTA, why do you even have to ask? Your parents are VERY OBVIOUSLY terrible people. How could you type this shit out without coming to that realization? Fuck your parents, go no contact because they're literal walking trash heaps.", "NTA.\nThe parents apparently need to have a relationship to be happy, so they want that for their son as well. They apparently cannot comprehend that he can be happy as a single. Which is a pity, really, because I\u2019m sure everybody here wants what\u2019s best for your brother, there\u2019s just a difference of opinion on what is best for him. Your parents are AHs for not respecting his right to determine what\u2019s best for him, and for talking about this to his children.", "NTA\n\nYour parents are insufferable and now they are bearing the consequences of their horrible behavior. I'm glad you have your brother's back.\n\nHopefully in time your parents will come to their senses and stop with their insane spouse-seeking campaign.", "NTA\n\nYour parents are the classical case of \"we know what's best for our children even if they think otherwise\", like my grandparents. These people usually end up alone, visited only on holidays.", "NTA - Your parents needed a dose of reality.  \n\nThey constantly ignored your brother\u2019s boundaries.  Fuck around and find out.", "NTA - but your parents are. When losing a partner there is absolutely no timeline, if any, to find another partner. If your parents supported the marriage between Cassie and your brother, why are they so eager for him to move on, especially that he seems to be doing okay, is not interested in romance, and his sons expressed no desire for a Step mom?! They have no \"side\" IMO, they must want him to bear more grandchildren or something ridiculous because it is illogical to me to put so much pressure on your widowed son to find love again. Sheesh", "NTA Your parents may think the subject of brother and his partner, or lack of partner, is their business. But they are wrong. Good for you for standing up for what a 38 year old man wants. He seems to be stable, content, and a good parent of happy children, all on his own. \n\nAnd if your parents don\u2019t STFU about the whole \u201cbut he needs to be in a relationship, we wanna help\u201d, thing, your brother may well get to the point they are not welcome in his life at all. He seems to have been astoundingly patient with them, but firm in his commitment to not replace his late wife.", "How awesome that your brother has you on his side, advocating for him and the boys.  THIS is what they need, not a woman that your brother has said he isn't interested in, and the boys have said they don't need.\n\nIt sounds to me as though your parents are the ones who are rude and making uncalled for comments.  They need to pull their heads in and consider that Nick was lucky to have his wife in his life, even for such a short time.  Few of us have that kind of marriage, and it's wonderful that he and Cassie found each other.\n\nYou sound like a wonderful sister, and a great Aunt.  Keep on being you - your brother and nephews will remember your support and appreciate every bit of it.\n\nSo sorry for your loss. Xx", "NTA.

You and your brother and his kids sound like well adjusted emotionally mature people who even after ten years will still be processing a lot of complex grief. Your parents sound insensitive and wilfully ignorant of boundaries regarding the personal life of their adult son and his own children. Even though they might be convinced they only want \u201cwhat\u2019s best\u201d for a their loved ones they need to be reminded that despite being parents and grandparents they are in fact capable of being completely and utterly wrong about the emotional needs of their children and grandchildren. Being related to someone does not give you direct access to their subjective experience nor does it give you the right to try and direct the choices they make as a grown adult. Hopefully they are not beyond the point where they will realise that, as their meddling can surely only come from a place of love, albeit a misguided one. \nComplex grief is a long and brutal journey. Give your brother and nephews all a big hug and congratulate yourselves for getting yourselves through it.", "NTA. \n\nIf I was your brother I'd have done the same thing, maybe even sooner. Finding that perfect match is inexplicably rare, let alone finding a match that can even begin to hold a candle to what you had previously. Your brother was lucky to find Cassie and it sounds like he received everything he could ask for in a partner, including children with good heads on their shoulders. \n\nYour parents should be ashamed of themselves and do not deserve to see their grandchildren after how they spoke of their late mother.", "NTA.\n\nI'd suggest going NC with your parents for awhile. Boundaries also apply for parents, and they are well past exceeding them. Just like children... they won't listen, and choose to not be respectful when in your company. Put them on time out, and have some peace.", "My parents are the kind of people who believe everyone should be coupled up with someone. They are also the kind of people who believe if you divorce or become a widow(er) that the healthy thing is to find another spouse because clearly you want to be married. I also think they see my brother's unwillingness to date as being inherently a bad thing. Like \"oh he's too defensive so he feels bad about dating again and we need to show him it's not hurting Cassie or his marriage to her in any way\".\n\nI don't know how he did either. Honestly I think it helped that I was on his side. So he knew he could at least be around me and not worry about me setting him up.", "They are. I think they are the kind of people who just need to be \"right\" about certain things.", "Mostly because I feel like I didn't really help in any way. I feel like I might have made them double down more and my brother doesn't need that either. But I do agree they have been awful about this and went into the horrific this last time.", "They reached that point by insulting Cassie and implying their marriage was unhappy. That was the straw the broke the camels back for him.", "Trauma can make you doubt yourself, I know that better than anyone but it's always worth it to tell your toxic parents exactly what they did wrong even if they can't accept it. You deserve to be heard, good on you for sticking up for your brother, his late wife, and his sons. It's clear that you loved Cassie and you love your brother and his nephews and they'll always know that because you did this. You did the right thing."]}
