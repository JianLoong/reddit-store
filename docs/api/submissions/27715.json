{"id": 27715, "submission_id": "16tcza6", "title": "AITA for calling my parents insensitive and telling them they managed to take things so far they are beyond repair?", "selftext": "I (25F) have an older brother, Nick (38M). Nick was married to his childhood sweetheart Cassie until her death 10 years ago. They had two children together. Cassie was a beloved member of our family. She was essentially my sister because I grew up knowing her and she was awesome. My brother loved her so much too.\n\nNick never dated or had a romantic relationship after Cassie died. He has always appeared happy to me. Maybe not the same kind of happy that he was with Cassie, but happy all the same. He focuses on different things other than relationships. Which is something that bothers our parents. Two years after Cassie died they started suggesting my brother could leave the kids with them and go out to meet some women. They introduced him to women they thought would be a good match for him, including some widows. My brother told them he was not interested in dating and he would appreciate it if they didn't push. My parents never stopped pushing and over the years they have strained their relationship with Nick and my nephews. About a year ago my nephews said their dad didn't need to have a woman to be a good dad, my parents suggested their lives would be better with a mom for the boys and a wife for Nick and that he would have an easier time parenting, and did they ever stop to think their mom was impossible to match for their dad. They also told my parents that they never ever wanted a new mom and that they hated the assumption otherwise, an assumption my parents often brought up.\n\nI have spoken to my brother and to the boys. I support them and they talk to me sometimes. It can be good for them to get it all out. I have also told my parents to back off in the past and pointed out that Nick is happy. They don't listen to me or care to hear me speak on it.\n\nMy brother took time from our parents and our parents grew tired of this. So a few days ago my parents decided to show up at my brother's house, while I was there, and they told him it's unhealthy to not have moved on into a new relationship. They said if Cassie had been such a terrible wife, his marriage that bad or if she had made him promise to never find another partner then he should find a way to get over it and move on. My brother kicked them out and told them he never wanted to see them again.\n\nMy parents decided to complain about it to me. I told them they had always been insensitive when it came to my brother's love life after Cassie but they had taken things way too far this last time and there was no repairing things. I told them it was disgusting to shit all over Cassie just because my brother didn't want to continue the life the way they wanted. They said I didn't care about my brother's happiness and didn't even try to see their side. Yesterday they said I was rude and it was uncalled for.

You and your brother and his kids sound like well adjusted emotionally mature people who even after ten years will still be processing a lot of complex grief. Your parents sound insensitive and wilfully ignorant of boundaries regarding the personal life of their adult son and his own children.

Being related to someone does not give you direct access to their subjective experience nor does it give you the right to try and direct the choices they make as a grown adult. Hopefully they are not beyond the point where they will realise that, as their meddling can surely only come from a place of love, albeit a misguided one. \nComplex grief is a long and brutal journey.

I know the feeling of not being interested in having a romantic relationship with anyone else, having family/friend telling you to get over it and move on only makes the grief worse.
