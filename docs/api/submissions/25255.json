They approved your holidays and so you\u2019re taking advantage of it. John can take another vacation and quit being immature", "NTA.  You requested and got the time off first.  Your manager needs to manage the situation without bothering you since that\u2019s both his job title and his job.", "Generally NTA. For sure your supervisor should be responsible for small urgent tasks. I'm guessing he's so incompetent that he doesn't know how to do your job anymore.\n\nAlthough having said that I will add one thing. This can also depend on your line of work. Some jobs come with emergency responsibilities. In some leadership positions you just have to be reachable. Or clinical positions where you follow patients long term. Even PM positions with large projects. So if you're in that kind of work, well then, you chose it and NTA may not apply.", "NTA.

You already had those days off, and to ask you to be available \u201cin case of emergency\u201d can quickly lead to you being at work half your vacation.

Who does that?", "Yup.. The minute new calendars come out, I get one for work, and seniority gets to pick (one week at a time) first.", "This \ud83d\udcaf. If you did choose to be available for urgent issues, they should follow a protocol that most companies that have on-call staff follow. Usually there is an hourly rate for keeping your phone on and ready - where I used to work it was $4 per hour. Then if you actually take a call and work, you are paid your normal hourly rate if you are hourly, plus OT and shift differentials. If you were salaried, you got a lump sum per day and it was enticing enough to make people do it. It\u2019s different everywhere and by profession, but this is what we did.", "Yep.

Will the country disappear from the face of Earth next year? Will his friend?

Vacation requests are granted at management discretion, generally first come- first served, and they are requests.

You put your PTO in and it was approved. If your manager wants to change things up, then they would be AH if they put blame on you.", "NTA.  Your holiday was planned and approved first.  Your manager can make any decision he would like concerning John.", "So what is your manager doing during this period of time where the emergencies might occur? Is he too stupid or too lazy to handle them?", "NTA. You said it yourself --if boss wants to give him the time off then Boss needs to cover the emergencies. \n\nI've never had a request like this made to me that didn't come with double makeup days (if you have to work one one of your vac days, they pay the whole day as a reg day and give me two vac days to make it up) or significant pay", "John should have submitted his request first then.     \nNot your problem to solve.     \nNTA", "NTA tell manager that if he wants you available in case of emergency, these days will not count as vacation and you should still be paid, while taking time off.

And if they demand, or ask why don't you JUST tell me, the answer is \"I can't\" or \"It's just impossible\". \n\nThey are the rude ones. They do not deserve and are not owed an answer. You have time off. It was approved. End of discussion.", "NTA - you got  permission first and actually why would his request supersede yours? Why can't he be around for emergencies? This sounds really lopsided. Perhaps you can ask John what he will do for you if you ruin your holiday to cover for his?", "Here's the thing. Do you want to burn every bridge you have at the company and ruin all good will with your co worker? Because that's what you are doing.\n\nIf you have a large team, staffing isn't as big a deal and you can make it more frist come frist serve. But if you have a small team, playing nice leads to everyone having a better time ans being able to enjoy things.\n\nWe have a team of three people in my area. Only 1 person can be off most of the time. Single day exceptions are allowed for major events, as long as it's single day. And we have to work with each other so no one feels slighted. Because we are adults, we do. I've already given away Nov 24 to a co-worker so I can take July 24. Someone volunteered to take the Wed before Thanksgiving as sole person this year so the other two can be off. As a result, we all get to do what we want and need to do. And I've taken work calls in London, Hawaii, and Singapore. London resulted in my working the flight back and I got two days of PTO refunded.\n\nSo while you are N.T.A and correct, you then understand that no one will give you courtesy in return.", "Nah, no reason to beef with John over this. It's the manager's responsibility.", "I actually did that this year lolol but I just moved my vacation to a better time. \n\nfor context, I teach, and thought I would have all thanksgiving week off this year. I do not. I moved it to winter break. lolol", "NTA. It's never worth it. Life is too short", "You are right. Manager can sacrifice his own holiday.  That is the way it goes. NTA", "NTA. I'm a manager and you're correct that it's entirely management's responsibility to handle this. If two of my employees want to take the same vacation days, preference is given to whoever requested and had those days approved first. If it's reasonable for both to be out as long as I'm available in case of emergency, that is my decision to make -- either approve both and be on call myself or deny the second person. It never feels good to tell someone that they can't take time off but it is NOT on any of my employees to be on call if I've approved their vacation time.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nIf that was the expectation, they needed to pay you to be on call. Your job is not a volunteer position.", "Nope. Have fun. If you wait for your work vacations to not cause any inconveniences or scheduling issues, you will never have a vacation.

Perhaps you can turn your colleague's spontaneity into your prosperity.", "You are not the asshole . Your vacation was planned and approved before the other person . Where you are going or what you are doing is no less important thank the other employee. It\u2019s the managers responsibility to cover a emergency or find someone who is not on vacation . You should not feel guilty or be made to feel guilty . I also hate when employees think they are entitled to all the holiday vacation openings because they have children . Like people with out children don\u2019t want to see their family at Christmas or whatever holiday . Such bullshit . Hate when they pull the \u201c I have kids \u201c card.", "Yeah, this is a really shitty move by the manager to shift the responsibility for saying no onto OP. Maybe they\u2019re a new leader and have time to learn, but I definitely wouldn\u2019t want to work for someone like this. Good managers remove obstacles and make your work life easier. They definitely don\u2019t use direct reports as a shield for unpopular decisions", "One call equals that day not coming out of leave.\n\nWhy can't the other guy be on call? I take. Laptop and answer when needed that way though am an hourly contractor. The guy with the sudden need to go on leave should be the one making accommodations."]}
