Your manager needs to manage the situation without bothering you since that\u2019s both his job title and his job.", "Generally NTA. For sure your supervisor should be responsible for small urgent tasks. I'm guessing he's so incompetent that he doesn't know how to do your job anymore.\n\nAlthough having said that I will add one thing. This can also depend on your line of work. Some jobs come with emergency responsibilities. In some leadership positions you just have to be reachable. Or clinical positions where you follow patients long term. Even PM positions with large projects. So if you're in that kind of work, well then, you chose it and NTA may not apply.", "NTA.

You already had those days off, and to ask you to be available \u201cin case of emergency\u201d can quickly lead to you being at work half your vacation. Tip: never, ever say you\u2019re not going away. Just keep talking about \u201cmy vacation\u201d or \u201cmy time off\u201d.

Who does that?", "Yup.. The minute new calendars come out, I get one for work, and seniority gets to pick (one week at a time) first.", "This \ud83d\udcaf. If you did choose to be available for urgent issues, they should follow a protocol that most companies that have on-call staff follow. Usually there is an hourly rate for keeping your phone on and ready - where I used to work it was $4 per hour. Then if you actually take a call and work, you are paid your normal hourly rate if you are hourly, plus OT and shift differentials. If you were salaried, you got a lump sum per day and it was enticing enough to make people do it. It\u2019s different everywhere and by profession, but this is what we did.", "Yep.  This way you are guaranteed that you will only be called in a true emergency."]}
