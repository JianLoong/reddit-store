I asked, how? The cake aside from the cake part it was just strawberries and cool whip and the money box kit was about $16.

I normally just charge them cost of supplies, maybe add on \u00a35 for my time and because electricity bills are sky rocketing at the moment. And I always give them an estimate of cost up front to make sure we\u2019re on the same page. It can quickly add up with multiple types of decorations etc. so I don\u2019t want to bake a cake someone can\u2019t afford.\n\nThe only time I\u2019ve charged for a tin was when my sister wanted a large number 5 cake which I\u2019m unlikely to ever use again. And I gave her the tin to keep after I\u2019d made the cake as she\u2019d paid for it. \n\nSplitting the cost of the cake ingredients is fine. Maybe you even paying very slightly more as she did use her time and her electricity etc. But she should not have bought a load of new equipment without clearing it with you first.", "NTA.  If she's planning to give you the 50% of the tools you bought then I guess N A H, but it seems like she just wants you to subsidize her buying baking tools.", "ESH. The cake is from both of you, therefore, the cost should be split down the middle, plus a little extra towards your sister as she is the one that made the cake and that takes time.", "No, she split both the ingredients and the tools. It was agreed that this was a joint present to our mom. I suggested buying a cake because I knew that there's a lot logistically that goes into making a cake and transporting it. Between trying to make sure it doesn't crack, cooling it enough so that it can be frosted and then having all the tools necessary, it was going to be simpler for everyone to buy it and then figure out how to insert the money box.
