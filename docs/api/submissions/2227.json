I asked, how? The cake aside from the cake part it was just strawberries and cool whip and the money box kit was about $16.

The reason why she wanted to make the cake in the first place was because she was tired of people telling her what to do.

Thanks!", "NTA\n\nTypically, unless provided in the \"lab\" as it were the student provides their own tools.", "NTA. I bake cakes for friends and family, not professionally just for fun. I normally just charge them cost of supplies, maybe add on \u00a35 for my time and because electricity bills are sky rocketing at the moment. And I always give them an estimate of cost up front to make sure we\u2019re on the same page. It can quickly add up with multiple types of decorations etc. so I don\u2019t want to bake a cake someone can\u2019t afford.\n\nThe only time I\u2019ve charged for a tin was when my sister wanted a large number 5 cake which I\u2019m unlikely to ever use again. And I gave her the tin to keep after I\u2019d made the cake as she\u2019d paid for it. \n\nSplitting the cost of the cake ingredients is fine. Maybe you even paying very slightly more as she did use her time and her electricity etc. But she should not have bought a load of new equipment without clearing it with you first.", "NTA.  If she's planning to give you the 50% of the tools you bought then I guess N A H, but it seems like she just wants you to subsidize her buying baking tools.", "ESH. The cake is from both of you, therefore, the cost should be split down the middle, plus a little extra towards your sister as she is the one that made the cake and that takes time.", "No, she split both the ingredients and the tools. It was agreed that this was a joint present to our mom. I suggested buying a cake because I knew that there's a lot logistically that goes into making a cake and transporting it. Between trying to make sure it doesn't crack, cooling it enough so that it can be frosted and then having all the tools necessary, it was going to be simpler for everyone to buy it and then figure out how to insert the money box. She took this as I didn't believe in her and so I let it be.", "WTF does that matter to the situation?", "None of your business if you can't answer the question.", "This right here wins for best exchange on Reddit today!!!", "Is that an actual pic of the cake? What tools did she need, a bowl and a whisk? Did she buy a mixer? It still doesn't add up.", "NTA but it would be funny to pay the half and then for every birthday/gift giving holiday of your sister\u2019s coming up give her a card with a picture of one of the baking supplies in it until you\u2019ve done them all", "Never heard of this concept before and I am revolted by how insanitary it sounds. Money in a cake? Yuck.\n\nNTA for the question.", "No, that cake looks somewhat decent. Hers was melting on the top and the cake portions were not really edible. The only thing that we ate for the most part were the strawberries.\n\nShe told me the Amazon purchase was 65 but didn't specify what was in it other than some cake cardboard and the box itself.", "If you had bought a cake you woumd have payed for the Tools of the bakeary and their time and wage as well. \nYou could pay for the ingredients and her time and she has the costs of the tools. That would be fair.", "NTA this is ridiculous. She's trying to charge you \"professional\" rates and even messing up in that.\n\nWhen you pay for a professional, yes you pay for use of tools and ingredients and time, but you're not paying for even HALF the cost of the tools themselves. It's like 10% at MAX, probably. Sister is (essentially) charging her \"first customer\" for her purchase of the tools, when the customer had no decision in that process. No, professionals pay for their tools over multiple sellings. It's what \"paying for itself\" can mean in a professional sense. You charge a little bit of extra money, and eventually you'll have recuperated the loss of buying the tools AND made extra profit.\n\n  Also, if you're paying a professional, you're paying for some level quality. And while I'm sure SIL didn't intend to make a quote \"inedible cake\" if a professional baker sold you an inedible cake, would you pay them? If you want to try and compromise, you can tell her that you'll pay for all of the ingredients and her time, but that you won't pay a cent for the tools. Because she bought those with no input from you, you didn't even know she didn't have them. You essentially paid for her try out baking. Which isn't fair to you.", "NAH. Easiest way to handle would be to give her your $50 share of supplies. and take half of the \u2018tools\u2019 she bought on Amazon.  tbh, her time is worth something and you\u2019re being petty and penny pinching. It\u2019s not a good look.", "NTA she wanted to learn. This sounds like a great life lesson.", "NTA, yeah her asking for so much afterward it was her trying to get you to subsidise her trying out a new hobby. It is not your job to finance her getting a new hobby.", "YTA - why are you refusing to pay when you\u2019re SAVING money compared to BUYING a cake which is what you initially suggested? \n\nYou would have paid $75-$87.5 each and now you only have to pay $50.", "The money is contained in a plastic box with the money in sleeves rolled up. There's a happy birthday sign with a clip that attaches to the roll. No money ever directly touches the cake itself.", "I would be more inclined to agree if the cake was actually edible and that the decision to make it wasn't mostly her wanting to try baking. When I buy a cake I'm not taking on the whole or even half the cost of new tools for every cake. Also, I know at least what I'm paying for.", "NTA \n\nI am a home baker and no way \"baking tools\" and ingredients cost 200$ \n\nYou can get a mixing bowl for \\~$4 + reusable or foil cake pans \\~$6 + wisk\\~$5 + measuring cups and spoons \\~$10 = $25 \n\nFor F\\*#k's sake you can get an ENTIRE baking set + cake decorating kit on amazon for $39....\n\nDon't let her play you...", "Most of the time pretty cakes are almost inedible. Wedding cakes taste disgusting most of the time for example. If you haven't ordered at the bakery before you don't really know what you get, it could have tasted not to your liking if a professionsl made it.\nI mean, I get that you don't want to pay for all her tools and you are NTA for not wantimg to pay, it is pretty ridiculous to expect that of you. It just would be silly to ruin your relationship over this as money does things to people nothing else can. Maybe compromise and tell her that the tools are the Christmas gifts or something.\nDo you know for a fact that trying out baking Was the reason or could money being tight be the reason for the diy cake and the amount of money that is supposed to be your half?\nI'm actually inrigued what kind of cake she made and what you would have bought instead.", "Offer to cut each tool in half. NTA", "NTA Among other things, she is asking you to pay more than if you had ordered a money cake as you originally intended and split the cost. Having you pay for her new baking tools is just silly.", "NTA\n\nAsk her if she is intending on cutting the baking tools in half to give to you. If not, you\u2019re not paying for her new cooking utensils.", "We would have gotten a cake from the supermarket ($16) and do the money box portion ourselves so the total cost would have been about max $40, $20 each when split.", "Might want to include that in the description then as it mentions $150-$175.", "It's not really a money being tight thing but her being tired of other people telling her what to do. It was fine to learn but I was saying it's mom's birthday on the line. Can't she do this another time? There's a lot of points of failure. However, she explicitly said that she wanted to try it and to learn from it and seemed upset that by warning her that it's more difficult than she thinks that I'm discouraging her instead of encouraging her. Not wanting to escalate the situation, I left it and let her figure it out. \n\nIt's ironic because the first thing she said when she brought the cake over was that next time we should just buy one from Whole Foods or something. It's like $16. Then she talked about learning to get better at making cakes so that she can charge people $$$ for it. \n\nOur relationship is generally hard so this instance isn't the first nor will it be the last weird spat. She makes me feel like I'm being ass even when I really don't think I am. It just takes up so much headspace that I finally decided to hit up AITA.", "NTA. She's the one who decided to go out and buy tools, you only agreed to split the cost of the cake. \n\nPlus, even for $100 you could've gotten a much better cake to put the kit into.", "Think we\u2019ve found the sister\u2019s account"]}
