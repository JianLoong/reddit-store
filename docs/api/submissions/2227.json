(If you're wondering what a money cake is: https://youtu.be/wPznUvA-IE0) \n\nBecause the quotes for buying a money cake ranged from $150-175, my sister suggested we make it ourselves. My sister wanted to make it from scratch but I suggested that we should buy a cake and then cut out the middle to insert the kit we get off Amazon. I don't think she's made a cake before and I was trying to tell her it's harder than she thinks it is as there are many points of failure. She however insisted because she was tired of people telling her what to do and so I relented. \n\nIn the end, the \"strawberry shortcake\" didn't look very good and was practically inedible but it didn't matter because the fun part was our mom pulling out the money. \n\nNow when it's time to split the cost of the cake she put the total cost at $100. I asked, how? The cake aside from the cake part it was just strawberries and cool whip and the money box kit was about $16. She explained that the boxes of strawberries were $12 each and that she got 2 of them. Even accounting these, I still didn't understand how it became $100. \n\nShe got upset because I asked how it cost that much. She felt that I didn't trust her and was performing an audit but I was just trying understand. It turns out she included the full Amazon bill that included all the baking tools she didn't have. She found me petty and ridiculous when I explained that I was fine to pay for the ingredients and the one time things she got like cake cardboards and the money box of course, but I didn't want to pay for cake carriers, pans and other tools because they were hers to keep. \n\nAITA? The reason why she wanted to make the cake in the first place was because she was tired of people telling her what to do. She wanted the opportunity to learn but it's not my responsibility that she doesn't have the tools handy.

If she wanted you to share those costs she should have asked you before purchase, but you still could have said no. That cost is barely less than a professional cake, so it doesn't sound like she did a good job researching before this adventure.", "NTA\n\nShe's got defensive because she can't back up the costs and doesn't want you to question it.", "NTA. She wanted to bake the cake from scratch. It was her responsibility to get the tools. And even if she absolutely had to split the cost of the tools (for financial reasons or whatever), she should've talked to you about it before buying them and asked if you could help her out.", "Nta, she wants you to foot the bill for her learning how to bake.", "NTA.
