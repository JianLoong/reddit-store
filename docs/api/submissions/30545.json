I\u2019m actually concerned there may be something going on with him if this has been over a year long issue.", "NTA. Your boundaries are important and I'm glad your parents seem to recognize this, and try to get your brother to understand the issue. Except... I'm not fully sure removing his door is doing that, since now he's blaming you for it instead of his own behavior. You don't say how old your brother is ? Hopefully your parents take this seriously and nip it in the bud, maybe with outside help if needed.", "No. NTA. He needs to learn someway. But also, do you guys not have locks on your doors? I think that would be the best way to deter him. Start locking doors when in private moments.", " NTA, your whole family has tried to tell him to be more respectful of others' space, and he still hasn't changed.\n\nHave You tried installing locks on the doors, even if it's just on the bathroom?", "You're NTA, my brother did the same thing. You shouldn't be expected to lock doors behind you inside the house when it's common sense to knock on someone else's door/the bathroom door before entering when you don't live alone.\n\nAll the people suggesting to \"just lock the door\"  \na) don't know if the door even has locks  \nb) don't know if the parents allow locked doors  \nc) don't know if he'd just find a way to open the door anyway  \nd) are not focusing on his lack of respect for other people's privacy and are instead looking to blame others for not physically preventing it instead of just teaching the brother to be more respectful\n\nUnless you coaxed them into removing his door, their choice of punishment is not your fault. His actions brought it on and you weren't the only one affected by them.", "NTA-but ask your parents if you can get a lock for your door and for the bathrooms.", "NTA. First of all, this wasn\u2019t just happening to you. Your brother is just blaming you because he doesn\u2019t want to take responsibility for his own actions.", "NTA - but also ask for locks. This sounds way too intentional unfortunately\u2014what\u2019s his excuse?", "If he\u2019d already did this to your mom, why in the world did you have to tell them?  Why hadn\u2019t they already dealt with this?  Is he like 4 or something?

If you're just generically tattling on him, you'd be TA. You get to protect your own privacy to whatever level you prefer. You don't get to police someone else's privacy. If he's walking in on someone else, it's up to them to object.\n\n(I'll note that if you don't want someone to walk in on you while you're in the shower, they make these things called \"locks\".)", "I\u2019m more concerned that you don\u2019t use locks for privacy.  The whole NTA/YTA would be negated by people locking doors for privacy\u2026 otherwise why have them?", "NTA. I don't exactly agree with removing a teenage child's door, and not respecting his right to privacy, is that really going to teach him to respect people's privacy? I think not. Anyway, that is your parents' problem, not yours. And you have every right to have your privacy respected. This is also something your brother really has to learn, or it could land him in even bigger trouble later on. I just do not agree with your parents' teaching methods. Talking with him, intensely and for hours on end, again and again until it sticks with him would be my suggestion. If that doesn't work, then therapy.", "YTA \nlock the door when you want privacy .

He is mad that he got called on his bs and has to suffer the consequences", "NTA- But your parents also need to put locks on the bathroom and your bedroom doors. I thought you were talking about a child and the last few years were 'since he could reach the door handle'. You say in the comments he's 20 and it's only been for a few years. This is disturbing. There simply cannot be any healthy or innocent reason for it.", "NTA, He doesn't live alone and needs to be conscious of everyone within the household, this is ground rules for living with anyone anywhere. If this is a recurring issues, rules may need to be enforced... also ya'll don't have locks or something... can't install something???", "Yeah, and I'm also worried if the family just starts locking doors, the brother might just intrude on other people's privacy (at school, or whatever) instead. There's a deep problem here that goes beyond locking mechanisms.", "Almost 20 years old - they said they are going drastic because nothing else is working - he refuses therapy as well and can't afford to live alone", "I was honestly against it but I don't know what to do here", "He generally says he's half asleep or not thinking - or flat out denies it happened", "Almost 20", "And door jams for under the door that cost $10 for two on Amazon.", "I more so complained because this is a reoccurring thing.", "A lot of the door don't have locks, as for bedrooms, generally the doors are closed when people are changing but some of the doors don't have a lock on them - another sibling has medical issues and myself I have a cat that continuously scratches the door finish and bites the wood if I don't have it open so I leave it slightly open at night and I don't sleep completely clothed so he barges in at the ass Crack of dawn.", "Sadly can't force him into therapy - as for speaking to him he just denies or yells at people or agrees and just does it again. They didn't want to go this far but after so many talks and trying to convince him for therapy they didn't see any other option.", "When you live with multiple people, it's common courtesy to knock on the bathroom door when it is closed and wait for a response. If no response, then you enter.", "A lot of times it's people's bedrooms and one doesn't have a lock due to medical issues and myself I am asleep when he barges in and I have a cat that will wreck the door if I don't have it slightly open", "I really don't like the sound of that. If his behavior continues, I'm afraid you'll have to put your foot down and tell your parents to be more coercive (for instance, making therapy mandatory if he wants to keep living there). Your safety is important and, if I understand correctly, you're a minor, so it should be their priority.", "Nothing. It's not your poor decision-making that caused this, it's his. He has to figure out how it feels to have his privacy invaded by no longer having a door for however long. \n\nWhen my brother had the habit of barging into rooms unannounced, I had to learn to change clothes in a certain corner of my room so that I would have a small amount of extra reaction time - your brother now has to learn that as well, but due to his own actions.

If bedrooms don\u2019t have ones on the handle, there are simple little cheap devices folks can put on doors that don\u2019t have them to lock (latch, bolt, etc) that can screw onto the door and frame to lock the door if it\u2019s not built into the handle.  I get medical issues are a concern but these aren\u2019t deadbolts here - they are merely deterrents to make someone aware the door won\u2019t open when they go to enter.   Can you easily break down the door if need be?  Yes, it\u2019s more for the privacy aspect.\n\nNot suggesting this for a 100% locked door scenario here, it\u2019s more to deal with times when you want privacy, you can get it without worrying (changing clothes, showering, alone time, whatever).", "\"Go to therapy or live somewhere else.\"", "That makes it even worse that he's barging into non-communal spaces.

Their biggest fear is that he will do this to a stranger and will end up getting punched out.", "Honestly it had but in more gentler ways like a lecture or sit down talk about how it must stop. It doesn't happen as often since he mostly just games in his room and goes to school and work but since it continues and he's an adult now they decided to take it further.", "Yeah at this point everyone locks the bathroom - generally bedrooms are unlocked either because it's late at night or they want the cat to be able to come and go without breaking doors.", "Oh, ok, I had misunderstood that part. I hope you can move out soon, although ideally you shouldn't be the one who makes big changes, here.\n\nMy biggest fear is that he will do this to a stranger and end up in prison, traumatizing the stranger in the process. But yeah, being punched out would also be bad.", "Ok, that makes more sense then\u2026except it makes the fact that your *adult* brother thinks this is your fault even more absurd.", "Yeah - at one point he walked in on our brothers gf changing and it didn't go well.", "He sounds dangerous, honestly. Taking away the door is so mild compared to everything he's already done.", "I mean... has anyone just tried decking him when he walks into a room uninvited and unannounced? just like... keep a nice sturdy umbrella or baseball bat or broom or something in your room and shoo him out like a rat? If you keep doing this each time he comes into your room he's gotta learn pretty quick right?\n\nHell get an airhorn. Each time he walks in your room honk that sucker loudly and just follow up with \"It seemed like you were half asleep and walked into the wrong room so I'm helping you wake up.\"\n\nmy childhood room was between the living room and kitchen (was a dining room converted into a room) so ***too*** many times was it used as a shortcut by my siblings.

And he's not mad at you because you did something wrong; he's mad at you because he is having to suffer a consequence for his choices.\n\nYour brother does need some professional attention. If he can't control his walking in on others (either some deep urge or deep lack of attention on his part), then he needs treatment. If he is choosing to walk in on others (taking away their right to privacy, steam rolling over their known wishes), then he needs treatment.", "Sounds like your brother is a weirdo.", "NTA Stupid decisions means funny consequences.

He is NOT doing it accidentally - this is intentional and seems like it is primarily the women being targeted (you, mom, other bro\u2019s gf). \n\nIt\u2019s voyeurism. He is getting away with it because your parents are letting him. He could easily develop further into stalking or actually sexually assaulting someone. \n\nGet a lock for your door- so that you can lock it when you are in there or not.
