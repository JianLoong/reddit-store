Our college is set up a little bit differently than most peoples, particularly the dorms, which, instead of being your typical dorm, are actually an old apartment complex that the school bought out and renovated.

Everyone, neurotypical or neurodivergent, is going to have different preferences for how they organize and maintain their living space. One of the most challenging aspects of a shared living situation is trying to find a compromise that works for everyone. Putting multiple people who have various conditions like ADHD, autism, etc in the same shared living space seems like a recipe for conflicting accessibility needs. For example, a blind person with a guide dog and someone who is allergic to dogs both have conditions that are protected by the ADA, but it would be unreasonable to expect them to live together. The only way to accommodate both of their needs would be to separate them. What you did, storing your groceries in the refrigerator, is completely reasonable. Unfortunately, for some reason, your roommate found it stressful/upsetting. In this situation, if the roommate was unable to cope with bread in the fridge, it sounds like the only solution is for the two of you not to share a refrigerator, which unfortunately meant you had to move to another dorm.

Speaking as a very high-functioning autistic person with a lower-functioning brother with formerly-known-as Asperger\u2019s.", "NTA and you should try sticking up for yourself by saying that you can put whatever er you want in the fridge on your shelf ans if she can't live with other people without respecting their personal choices and food preferences then she needs to leave. \" Don't punish me bc off her personal problems with boundaries.\"", "NTA If it's as bad as they say it is, then she needs therapy, not making you move. Eventually she is going to have to live in the real world, not \"safe places\". She will have to learn to deal with stuff. The college is doing her no favors.", "Nta, i always put opened items in the fridge to avoid getting ants in the first place. Her weirdness is on her. Its you shelf.", "SO true^", "Yes, the college should do something, but also OP, just buy these:   \n\"TERRO T300B Liquid Ant Killer.\" They aren't expensive. They work. Do it.", "The root of the problem is the roomate", "THIS. My bf and I are both autistic, and even though our autism lines up so harmoniously in so many ways, we definitely have issues with certain things not being done exactly the way we want them to be, but we don't get to just lose our shit at each other every time our issues clash. We sit down and talk to each other like grown ass adults and find a way to compromise.", "Thank you for saying that. \u201cCreepy\u201d and \u201cautistic\u201d is not even remotely descriptive of protecting your food from pests, and it bums me out OP used those phrases against herself for doing something totally normal. I wonder how many times the poor thing has been called creepy for normal things", "I think most households with both ants and a fridge would put food in the fridge to protect it from ants.\n\nI also think, and dislike, the attitude if school management in finding OP wrong in his rational solution. And admin should start dealing with the ants and not leave the students hanging out there.", "Ooh, I like the plus side here! Hopefully OP wins in the end. NTA.", "I basically eat bread as toast or grilled cheese, nothing else. So the drier doesn't really bother me, so fridge works great.", "that fridge bread life", "nice that is awesome hah to know, now this was beneficial OP had a roomie who had a meltdown about bread and cereal in the fridge! :D", "American supermarket bread isn't like cake but it's filled with sugars and other substances that keep it from spoiling.", "Ah okay. Thank you.", "Ours is 900w max, although the 750w mode just seems to be 900w for 8 out of every 10 seconds.", "OP, there is nothing \"creepy\" about putting cereal and bread in the fridge. Don't put yourself down like that. And you're totally NTA. PS: I've had apartments in NYC where I kept just about everything in the fridge because of cockroaches.", "NTA it\u2019s not your job to accommodate her wants. Your shelf can have whatever you want on it that isn\u2019t impacting anyone else\u2019s food.", "I don't think you are the asshole. She is the one being unreasonable if anything.", "NTA. First, I store those items in my fridge anyway just to  make them last longer. And second it is your shelf. you are allowed to do with it as you see fit. I understand she has sensory issues, but that\u2019s something she needs to learn to work with. I have OCD and anxiety. I work hard to not enforce my likes/ticks on others", "NTA. And get some diatomaceous earth. Good for killing ants.", "NTA! I put my bread in the fridge because sometimes it gets moldy before its gone. And since cereal is going to have cold milk poured on it, what difference does it make? You sound proactive and reasonable to me. You're fine and will probably do well to get away from that unyielding roommate.", "NTA. bread definitely belongs in the fridge, but considering the ant problem, and it was in YOUR side of the fridge, so why should they care?", "Absolutely not !!!!  There usually isn\u2019t harm in putting things that *require* cold into also cold.  I put several things in the fridge that don\u2019t need it, but works well.  Can freeze a lot more than many people realize as well.\n\nSounds like the learned a single outlook and haven\u2019t figured out how to accept some things have multiple options.  That\u2019s an issue they need to work on, not you.  THEY should have moved, not you.", "NTA. You shouldn't have been moved. You did nothing wrong. She's the one with the problem, so it should have been her having to move.", "(NTA) IMO Sounds like the roommate is using her diagnosis to manipulate y'all into doing what she wants. What about you? What about everyone else's feelings and their personal things that bother them? You're fine. She needs to learn to live with other people if she's going to roommate with others similar to her.", "NTA. It's your shelf, and they are food items. I keep my bread in the fridge. Yes, yes- I know it gets stale more quickly, but I'd rather have stale bread than moldy bread.", "NTA.\n\nI'm stunned that she involved the college guidance counselor; waste of everyone's time for something so minor.\n\nI disagree with their decision to move you elsewhere; instead of resolving the problem of ants they've ignored it. The guidance counselor should have talked her through this and together come up with an acceptable answer for all. As it stands, it seems you are the one being punished. \n\nDisrespectful of her sensory issues? News for your roommate; after college and in the real world she won't get her way every time she has a meltdown. This is petty nonsense; I can just imagine her complaining about a coworker who did not store what she deemed appropriate in the company refrigerator.\n\nOn a happier note, I really hope your new place is better than this one in every aspect.", "NTA a line of black pepper where the little beasties enter will deter them by burning their little feet, but your roommate was way out of line.  She's going to have a rude awakening when she gets in the real world.", "NTA your roommate should be the one to have to move, not you OP.\n If not to late speak to your guidance counselor about that situation and tell them that they need to get rid of the ants.\n Funny how bread and cereal in the fridge on your shelf is a problem for her sensory issues but she has zero problem with ants all up in her food is really telling and if you can\u2019t get help resolving the ant problem then contact the health department and see what they have to say about your college housing!\n You are not creepy or is it unusual for you to put food in the refrigerator. She is just wanting to cause drama. Good luck with everything!", "NTA.  And there\u2019s nothing creepy or autistic about keeping bread and cereal in the fridge.  I spend part of the year in a hot, humid country and things spoil really fast.  And we also have ants, and these tiny little light-colored bugs that are even smaller than ants and seem to be particularly attracted to bread.  So I always keep everything in the fridge.  Your college should have moved the girl with the issue instead of making you move.", "NTA! You aren't the only one that outs cereal in the fridge. I do the same thing also to keep any bugs from trying to get in my cereal bag. And honestly, it's your stuff and you decision. No one tells you what is right and what is wrong lol. Just because they find something abnormal or it just bothers them; more of a reason to do it lol.", "NTA\n\nStoring bread in the fridge makes it last longer.\n\nYou had a practical reason for putting that and cereal in there. It's not weird. \n\nAnd there's nothing creepy about it even if you didn't have a real reason!", "In the meantime put some sugar water in small bowls and a few drops of boric acid (hardware store) on the floor where they come in, they will either go into the water and drown or take the boric acid back to the nest.  It will help over time until the dorm gets their act together but I would make complaints early and often, if there are ants OPs room is not the only one", "Yes! Terro is amazing! (I think it\u2019s basically the boric acid and sugar water another person has mentioned ). You do have to be patient and let the ants do their thing for a while but I\u2019ve had it be super effective multiple times. (I try not to feel guilty that the busy busy ants think they\u2019ve scored when the are really poisoning their nest though. I have issues. Heh.)", "Diatomaceous earth. Even the food grade stuff is cheap, it's no harder to use than the talcum powder, and unlike most \"pet safe\" ant killers and other non-poison but still chemical ant blockers, it's genuinely safe around cats. (And other pets and humans and even human babies. But cats in particular are in some ways super fragile.)", "I rented for several months in a house that turned out to be effectively on top of a giant ant hill, even with the landlord spraying the house and surrounding trees multiple times. I once opened a new, still sealed jar of peanut butter to find that it was full of them.", "I moved into a beach house and my bread gets moldy so quickly now. It\u2019s not humid where I live but I think there is like salty moist air that blows in. I think a lot of it is the type of bread and the environment.", "Yes, of course I knew that, but I stand corrected re the bread! I still have no idea how that product is still OK after being in the pantry for two months though.\n\nA have to admit to having preconceived ideas about American food. One memorable example: saw a video a few years ago of a woman complaining that the icecream she purchased had turned bad, she did some experiment where she left it on the counter and it melted then turned mouldy as one would expect of something made with actual dairy products. She compared it to some product made with a shitload of preservatives as the marker for what she expected. Most of the comments were from non-Americans \"ewwwww\"-ing at the product that didn't melt and didn't go \"off\"!", "Even that sounds more like thickeners/stabilizers like guar gum than preservatives, which don't change the texture of food.  Looking around at ingredients, I'm not seeing much in the way of preservatives in ice cream even in the really cheap brands, just more processed sugars and stabilizers.\n\nReally, the most common preservatives I'm finding are just various forms of salts - sodium salts, potassium salts, calcium salts, etc. Not really great for you, and some worse than others, but it's hard to find products with anything crazy going on. (Except Banquet frozen meals, which have every additive under the sun plus mechanically processed chicken, but I don't think anyone buying a $1.50 frozen meal cares about quality ingredients.)"]}
