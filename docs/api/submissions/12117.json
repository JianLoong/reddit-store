Our college is set up a little bit differently than most peoples, particularly the dorms, which, instead of being your typical dorm, are actually an old apartment complex that the school bought out and renovated. Usually, there are about three rooms, some of which are shared, a shared living room, a shared bathroom, and shared kitchen. \n\nWe also have a large pantry in the refrigerator, a roommate agreement is Made by all occupants in a particular unit at the beginning of the year about who\u2019s food goes where. The way we did it is that since there were three of us we each got a shelf in the refrigerator and a shelf in the pantry. The remaining shelf was used for items that were bought for everybody.\n\nHere is where the problem lies. We have ants. The ants have already ruined most of the food in the pantry. I found a bunch in a loaf of bread that I bought. Because I didn\u2019t want them contaminating anything else, when I went and bought new cereal and bread for myself, I put them on my shelf in the refrigerator. I know it\u2019s creepy, autistic and really unconventional but that\u2019s what my mom did when we had ants in our house when I was younger And it worked.\n\nNext thing, I know, I have to deal with my roommate, complaining about me, putting the bread and cereal in the refrigerator. I asked her why it even matters because it\u2019s on my shelf, it\u2019s my stuff, and she\u2019s not gonna eat it. My roommate is very particular about the way she wants things it\u2019s part of whatever condition she has. And if she doesn\u2019t get things exactly the way that she wants then she gets snippy with everybody else, and talks shit about us behind our backs. Which is exactly what she did to me.\n\nI ended up getting taken to the guidance counselor\u2019s office because she had made a complaint about what I had done with my food. She was in there having a whole ass meltdown, saying that it was weird and fucked up and that Non-refrigeratable food did not go in that area. I explained to them the ant problem, and they told me that because my with doing things was causing her sensory distress that I had to be transferred to another dorm.\n\nI think I might be the asshole, because admittedly, storing those things in refrigerator is abnormal. and I was also being disrespectful of her sensory issues, even though I don\u2019t understand them. It\u2019s also the fact that I realize in retrospect, maybe I could\u2019ve bought some Tupperware containers and put everything in that But for some reason it didn\u2019t occur to me at the time.", "created_utc": 1678628390, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11pes4c/aita_for_putting_cereal_in_the_fridge/", "score": 72, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If it\u2019s impacting her that much then maybe she should have a mini fridge in her room so she doesn\u2019t have to look at your food being unconventional.

I do it because it keeps it from going bad longer. It can make it go stale faster, but honestly I have never noticed that as a problem.\n\nIt was *your* shelf. As long as you keep it clean she should have no objections.\n\nI appreciate that she has sensory issues but she should recognize that those are something for her to deal with, not a failing on your part. At most she should kindly ask you to do something different as a favor to her. She should not be demanding you to change.\n\nThe school  should give her the support she needs to handle her sensory issues, but they should not make managing it your responsibility. The appropriate thing would be to move *her* to a different dorm so that she can be somewhere that doesn't cause her distress.", "NTA\n\nI was in one of those places too\n\nYou will learn that the issues they decide to fix are not always the right ones.\n\nYou also have to understand they favour the people who create the least worst drama.

Have fun losing stupid battles. It won't end there.", "NTA - Putting stuff in the refrigerator because of ants is not abnormal, it's something a lot of people do. Not to mention that what people store in the refrigerator is something that varies based on how you were raised, where you live, your food preferences, etc. People do things differently. Learning about those differences and dealing with them is a part of living with other people.", "NTA - it's your shelf, and putting bread or cereal in the fridge isn't \"creepy\" or even particularly weird.

I think moving someone to another apartment was the right call here; \"person who puts their cereal in the refrigerator to solve an ant problem\" and \"person who is very upset by cereal in the refrigerator and wants to follow the letter of the roommate agreement you signed regardless of ants\" are not compatible roommates.", "NTA- you utilised your space as efficient as possible, avoiding food waste in the process.

That said, my grandma freezes bread.", "NTA 100% her sensory issues don't give her the right to dictate what you do with your space.", "NTA- sounds like you came up with a very reasonable solution to the ant problem while still keeping to the agreement of using only your shelf. \n\nDon\u2019t take the complaint to heart as you can\u2019t always predict others sensory triggers. The upside is you are moving to an ant free dorm.", "NTA i keep my bread in the fridge and when i have ants or pantry moths i keep all pantry stuff in my fridge (pasta, rice, anything that's grains and opened box)", "NTA - I've stored bread and cereal in the fridge before and will do so again.

OP that's your food you can store it how you want in  your designated space.\nI have ants in my house too, I bought on Amazon 24 air tight containers and put every food that comes in a bag or box there.", "There's no personal conflict here just two people living their lives. You were trying to protect your food from an insect infestation but your roommate is very particular about certain things and frankly doesn't sound like they're a good room mate. You did nothing wrong and you're not weird or abnormal. Please don't internalize hurtful words someone throws at you during their own struggles. Talk to your support about this.", "NTA. \n\nAlso, there is nothing inherently autistic about putting food in the fridge, regardless of what it is, especially because you had a logical reason to do so.

But just in general, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re TA for any reason, and being transferred is just that- her condition just makes you incompatible as roommates.

Assuming the college is responsible for managing accommodations for studends' particular needs then also not her fault.\n\nCollege - YTA\n\n1. regardless of anything else, they need to sort the ants.\n2. Unless it's a stated practice for resolving conflict that you agreed to on moving in, arbitrating that you are the problem and must be moved is a lazy, ineffectual, bullshit way of managing that allows people to pose as victims to bully anyone they like ( not saying this is what is happening, but I've had it happen).\n3. If it's the college's responsibility to manage accomodations for student's needs, then this girl needs to be placed in a solo appartment, as it is totally unreasonable to expect her to deal with other people 'messing things up', and for other people to have to cater to this need.\n\n\nAs an aside, I know people who keep bread in the fridge as standard. There is some logic to it, it lasts longer if it stays dry, and it actually toasts better. I'd probably do it myself if I had more room.", "NTA.  Your roommate has issues.
