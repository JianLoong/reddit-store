Ofc with that come the nagging \"I want grandkids\" from my mom. My dad is less old fashioned, so he lays off my back. \n\nSome background about me my mom: She has schizophrenia, which does pass on genetically. When I was a teen, she had my sister, got postpartum depression, and that led to her schizho to escalate. She also had an especially hard birth that left her in hospital for almost a month. Basically, for around 2-3 years of my young teen life I was helping to take care of my sister, while my mom was in and out of mental institutions. I got to see the worst of pregnancy, where it can lead, and also experienced what taking care of a young baby is. It also, obviously, left me some serious trauma in regard to the whole subject of having kids. Add to that the fact that I, myself, have some mental health risk, and that I don't particularly want that concern for any possible child of mine. So due to that, and my utter lack of interest in kids, it's just not worth the hassle of pregnancy and babies. \n\nAnyway, as I was saying, she's been nagging for around a year that she wants grandkids, how pretty our grandkids will look, how I am BOUND to change my mind, not listening to the fact I have been telling her since I was 20ish that I don't want, nor will I ever want, kids of my own. So the other day she decided to bring it up yet again, this time in front of my bf (who knows all of this, at least...) I got SO sick of it, I just told the truth to her face: that in big part, I don't want kids because of how I saw her handle my young sister, and how I don't want to end up like her. (Worth noting before that I told her the \"softer\" reasons of me not wanting to be pregnant and just not liking kids, she just wouldn't listen...)\nShe got super upset about that. That, I understand - but she then demanded I take it back, and refused to acknowledge any part she may have played in my decision. Later my dad also told me I wasn't ok for saying that to her, and that I know how easily insulted she is, even if he acknowledges that I have the right to feel that way. (Again, worth mentioning here she is now mentally stable and not in any risk...)\n\nShe hasn't talked to me since (been around a week).\nTo be fair, I do feel bad for hurting her, but at the same time it's the honest to God truth, and I hope it gets her to lay off my back.

In fact, she may not have solid memories of just how bad things were. I have this issue with my mom who suffered with her bipolar disorder when we were kids. It was rough.

Her previous mental illness wasn\u2019t her fault, but she\u2019s stable now and continuously badgering you for grand babies when you\u2019ve already been clear is her fault since it\u2019s a conscious choice she\u2019s making. You chose to be nice about it and softly brush about the issue when you could have gone full scorched Earth, though hearing your child call you a bad mum is gonna hurt like hell. You need to have a heart to heart with her, and just be totally honest about it all. \nHave you guys ever talked about what went down when you were younger? It might be a good shout to suggest family therapy to her if you can get access so you guys can go somewhere neutral to work it all out. Taking care of a baby is backbreaking work, there\u2019s a reason they watch mums like hawks after birth and doing the baby shift as a young teen must have been a totally devastating experience. Maybe sit her down and apologise for hurting her, and just explaining how you\u2019ve been hurting from what you experienced when you were younger? She might be in denial about it all, or just unaware of the severity since she was institutionalised during that time. I get why dads defending her but\u2026.. did he expect you to field these kinds of questions when you\u2019re like 50 and she\u2019s still asking?

You have every right to be hurt. Your reaction wasn't crazy or unreasonable, IMO, but it was inconsiderate, as her behavior has been to you. In your shoes, I'd ask myself what I actually want.

But to have a healthy relationship with your mom that also gets her to stop treating you inconsiderate? I'm not so sure.\n\nI think she's an asshole and so are you.

Only the mother matters in your take. Op is entitled to her feelings and has the right to tell them. The mother obviously is not capable of have a healthy relationship. To be considerate with people that are not considerate with you is a moot point.", "I think I'm misunderstood. I don't think that OP's feelings are unfair, I also don't think her mother is in the right. I think their both assholes. Just because her mother isn't \"capable of a healthy relationship\", which very well may be true, is not an ethical excuse to attack someone's nearest insecurities. I'm not advocate OP even step down from their point, I just don't think the specifics are inherent to conflict resolution. OPs mother is choosing to be an obnoxious asshole and OP CHOSE to respond in a way that is directly hurtful. That sounds like an asshole to me."]}
