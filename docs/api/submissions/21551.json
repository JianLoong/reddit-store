When you have your own car you can set whatever rules you want for passengers.", "YTA, but a soft one as you're only 15 and it's developmentally appropriate to learn these things at your age. \n\nThis is a boundary vs rule issue.\nNow how boundaries work is like this. They apply to your body, your possessions, your time, and your space, and are up to you to enforce. So your sister would be completely allowed to say \"I won't allow smoking in my car\" for eg. And if someone tried to smoke in her car or did, she'd enforce that boundary by no longer letting them get inside the car. \nNow what you're doing is trying to impose is a rule on a third person, about a possession NOT your own. So \"you have to let me smoke in your car/you can't smoke in your car\". You can't do that. I mean, you can say it, but this is how people tend to react to imposed rules on themselves or their property. They say no. She's being a bit petty about it, probably because you hurt her feelings, but she is allowed to say who gets to use her car or not.

You should not wash clothes after one wear unless they are muddy or something. Lots of people let their dog sleep on their bed.
