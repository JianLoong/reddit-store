They apply to your body, your possessions, your time, and your space, and are up to you to enforce. So your sister would be completely allowed to say \"I won't allow smoking in my car\" for eg. And if someone tried to smoke in her car or did, she'd enforce that boundary by no longer letting them get inside the car. \nNow what you're doing is trying to impose is a rule on a third person, about a possession NOT your own. So \"you have to let me smoke in your car/you can't smoke in your car\". You can't do that. I mean, you can say it, but this is how people tend to react to imposed rules on themselves or their property. They say no.

You should not wash clothes after one wear unless they are muddy or something. Lots of people let their dog sleep on their bed.

We really shouldn't be washing our skin and hair with soap as often as we've been conditioned to unless we get immensely sweaty sooner than expected, it's damaging for both because it strips away natural oils and protection and causes our body to try and replace them in overdrive, so most people actually function with either too much or too little natural oil throughout the day and repeat it all over again the next, with no in-between. Clothes, as stated above, should not be getting washed after every wear either, both for longevity, skin contact, and environmental reasons, again, unless they get unexpectedly *really* dirty.
