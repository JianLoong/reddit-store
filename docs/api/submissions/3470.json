Wrong.", "NTA. Good on you for not letting him take advantage of you", "NTA. He didn't want to contribute and he was preventing you from using it when you wanted to.

YTA for putting it in a common space and not expecting that he would use it. but, NTA for having what is essentially your tv, put in your bedroom, for you to watch. \n\nMoving it to your bedroom was probably the best way to settle the situation though.

You know?", "I didn\u2019t expect him to use it since he said \u201cI\u2019m never gonna use it\u201d LOL. But fair enough. Plus I let him use it while I wasn\u2019t around anyway.", ">I guess.

You know?\n\nLet me put it this way, if you purchased a coffee maker for your own use and brought it into the office, I would expect you to keep it in a communal area (kitchen) where  others  would have the use of it, however I would not expect others to have free use of your coffee pods, the fact that others are using the machine with their own coffee pods does not prevent you from using it.\n\nWith a TV it is sort of the same idea, except that by him using it he prevents you from using it unless both of you are watching the same show together. You actually do however have the option to move it into your room and you can say tough luck (tone is important here) without being TA. My advise would be to not bring it back out into the communal area, if he wants to Netflix and chill he can buy his own TV.", "I know, but it's like buying a toaster, I don't want toast, but if I have a toaster, hey, might as well make toast.", "LOL touch\u00e9 very true", "Put a lock on your door, he's an entitled ass and will be in there as soon as your back is turned", "300 buys him half a tv.Nothing gets him nothing.He doesn\u2019t watch it according to him.", "Lol, we had the same situation with a cheapskate cousin who didn't want to go in on a boat share but absolutely wanted access to the boat.

About 11 years ago I moved in with my girlfriend at the time, we paid the mortgage on the house that she inherited  from her GPA when he passed. Her mom also lived with her. Well we were providing all the food in the house and she was eating alot!!! She made 200 in food stamps on top of working full time at red Robin. What she did though was go hang out with friends and use all her food stamps on them. I told her she needs to chip in more with the food, she said no! While she was at work I moved the fridge into out room and she lost her shit. My girl thought it was funny and understood why it happened. For weeks I had to hear the mom complain until I told her I'm not taking the fridge out of the room until she moves out! She moved out a few weeks after that! Was so much nicer without her", "NTA\n\nYou bought, you dictate who uses and where it goes.", "NTA - he can have it back when/if he pays.", "NTA...

You have every right to move your electronics into your room to regain possession and use of them.

I like the suggestions of setting up parental control, so that you can have it back in the living room while locked. If you end up agreeing to him paying for half, may I suggest you only have him pay for a third for his usage time? That way, you can still take priority usage (& the remote) if you both want to watch something at the same time.

He can get his own for his room.", "NTA. Do not offer him the chance to now give you half for it to stay in the living room. He will hog it and not let you watch when you want. (If he did that when he had no claim to it, he will do it even more when he has some claim to it - while ignoring that you have at least as much claim to it.)\n\nNow, if he has changed his mind he did \"not need a tv and would never be using it\", then he can go get a tv for himself. And he will need to keep it in his bedroom.\n\nYou can still keep your tv in the living room since you enjoy watching it there, AND since you bought your personal tv first. I would simply keep the remotes (and streaming stick) locked away in your room when you are not using them. If you come home and want to watch something, then you get to watch. If he had the tv on, he needs to turn it over to you. No waiting. PERIOD. You don't have to stop him from being in the living room with you or monitor if he manages to turn on the tv when you are not around. But he does not have use of your remotes - ever. Or of the tv anytime you want to watch whatever you want to watch. If you have any streaming services, then password lock them. He doesn't get access to that either since 'he never watches tv\" and won't pay a cent for it.\n\nHere's the hard part. You seem to be easily pushed around by your brother. If you can't stand up to him, you may want to start looking for another roommate situation you can transition to when this lease is up. Your brother seems to be a bully who uses his aggressive personality to take responsibility for nothing while grabbing total control of whatever he wants. Not someone you want to be stuck with for long.", "Yeah but $300 is enough to get a decent new tv for her own room to fix that issue.", "Are there any passcodes that can be put on the TV?  I know on ours I need to use a pin to order a movie that costs more than ten dollars.  Maybe there are more places a code can be required?\n\nEdit:  Christmas is next month.  Ask him if he wants for a gift that you go halfers with him on a 39 incher or so.  There are tons of deals on now; you could gift him early.", "That doesn\u2019t make sense \nSo let\u2019s say OP goes halfsies with her brother it would be 300/ch.\nThen she would spend another 300 on another smaller tv so she\u2019s spending the same amount of money but getting less?", "NTA.

Put the tv back in the living room.

Then you offer to use it in your room, he will accept because he doesn\u2019t want a broken TV. Then turn off the filter in your room and use the remote that he bought with his own money to watch TV.\n\nTL;DR \n\nTrick your brother into the thinking the remote is broken, force him to buy a new one.
