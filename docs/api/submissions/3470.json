You asked him to split the cost, and he made an informed decision as a (supposed) big boy that he was not interested in having a TV. He was given every opportunity. And in fact, far from being the AH, YOU WERE INCREDIBLY GENEROUS, putting the snazzy TV that you paid for entirely on your own into the shared living room and allowing him to use it despite the fact that he had clearly lied (or if we're being generous, \"was mistaken\", and was more than happy to use it when it magically became available to him for free.\n\nWhat you weren't happy to do was have him HIJACK the TV that he refused to contribute a single cent to the cost of, and use it literally to your exclusion after he insisted that he didn't even want a TV at all. \n\nYou're NTA. All you did was take him at his word. Again, feel free to point that out. From every possible angle, he's the AH here.", "NTA. He's taking clear advantage and you're not putting up with it.

Imo, him using it when you aren't isn't a big deal, but him not giving it up when you do want it is not ok since he declined to split the costs.", "No, you did the right thing . See if he wants to pay half now .", "NTA.  Now he gets to use it just as much as he said he would - not at all. He thought he could get away with not paying for the TV and still get the use of it.  Wrong.", "NTA. Good on you for not letting him take advantage of you", "NTA. He didn't want to contribute and he was preventing you from using it when you wanted to. Be careful that he doesn't start hanging out in your room when you're not home", "He used you for a free TV and dates. NTA.", "NTA.

That\u2019s what you should have done to begin with.", "I'm on this fence about this. YTA for putting it in a common space and not expecting that he would use it. but, NTA for having what is essentially your tv, put in your bedroom, for you to watch. \n\nMoving it to your bedroom was probably the best way to settle the situation though. But if he wants it back in the living room, maybe have him pitch in an pay for the streaming services until it equals the $300 of his half of the tv or something.", "Honestly, I wouldn't offer him that deal, sounds like he's using the tv all the time and OP hardly ever gets to use it, so even going half and half on it, she'd only get to use the tv less than half the time.", "This.", "I guess. But I shouldn\u2019t have to put it in a specific \u201cinconvenient\u201d spot in our apartment to be sure he wouldn\u2019t use it. Like, he said he wouldn\u2019t, and he didn\u2019t pay for it. You know?", "I didn\u2019t expect him to use it since he said \u201cI\u2019m never gonna use it\u201d LOL. But fair enough. Plus I let him use it while I wasn\u2019t around anyway.", ">I guess.

You know?\n\nLet me put it this way, if you purchased a coffee maker for your own use and brought it into the office, I would expect you to keep it in a communal area (kitchen) where  others  would have the use of it, however I would not expect others to have free use of your coffee pods, the fact that others are using the machine with their own coffee pods does not prevent you from using it.\n\nWith a TV it is sort of the same idea, except that by him using it he prevents you from using it unless both of you are watching the same show together. You actually do however have the option to move it into your room and you can say tough luck (tone is important here) without being TA. My advise would be to not bring it back out into the communal area, if he wants to Netflix and chill he can buy his own TV.", "I know, but it's like buying a toaster, I don't want toast, but if I have a toaster, hey, might as well make toast.", "LOL touch\u00e9 very true"]}
