She\u2019s a sweetheart but kind of blunt. Over the course of the party: She pointed out that my haircut made my face look round - but that\u2019s the chemo causing fluid build up. She asked me multiple times if I was sure I didn\u2019t want a drink, mostly because she was also getting herself one.

She literally pushed you into snapping at her. It\u2019s never appropriate to comment on someone\u2019s appearance or choice of abstaining from alcohol the way she was doing.", "NTA. \n\nShe was being pushy about details and you gave her an answer. \n\nThe only AHs in this situation are your brother and his wife.", "I HATE being around people like your brother\u2019s girlfriend that won\u2019t take a moment to censor themselves. They don\u2019t care when they hurt other peoples feelings. Should you have waited for a different time to reveal your diagnosis? Yeah, but her comments were so obnoxious she deserves some repercussions.", "NTA under these very specific circumstances. While you don\u2019t seem to dislike your SiL, her bluntness is alone the problem, it is accompanied by lack of tact and an inability to read the room.\n\nYour disclosure was unplanned and reflexive. Don\u2019t beat yourself up over it.", "NTA. She stated a bunch of opinions. You stated a fact. People should learn to keep their opinions to themselves unless asked for it.", "NTA, She kept pushing you and being rude about it. She got the answer for the comments she has been making. Even if you did not have cancer that would still be uncalled for.  \n\n\nHope all goes well for you and that you recover soon. Best wishes op", "NTA, clearly your brother's GF wasn't taking no for an answer. And consistently commenting on your hair is kind of rude, even if she's lacking in social mores. It is entirely understandable that you would eventually snap at it. Could you have taken her aside to tell her? Sure. But there is a line for everyone.", "NTA, your brother's girlfriend was very rude to keep commenting and questioning your appearance. His thoughtless girlfriend ruined their announcements. You would not have brought up your cancer had she not been badgering you with questions.", "Absolutely, completely NTA. What you are going through is more than enough reason to be tetchy and want to be left alone. They should be apologizing to you for being pushy.", "Well...I'd say it's a shame your brother didn't know to share with the GF - but...I guess she learned a valuable lesson.

You did nothing wrong.", "NTA\n\nShe needs to learn to keep their uninvited opinions to themselves.\n\nAsk your brother if telling her to shut the eff up would have been more appropriate.", "NTA. She didn\u2019t need to point out your style and lack of jewelry, how is that any of her business? She was definitely probing you, even if she\u2019s not the best at picking up social cues, that\u2019s not casual social behavior.", "NTA, it\u2019s not your fault your brother isn\u2019t around more so him visiting is a big deal. She asked questions and got in your business. It wasn\u2019t ideal to lose your temper, but you certainly weren\u2019t announcing it to take away from them.", "NTA. Maybe (just maybe) this will push your brother's girlfriend into learning some social mores before she treats someone else so rudely. Sure, the party may have been for your brother and his girlfriend, but that was no excuse for her to be badgering you about your appearance.\n\nToo many people use being \"blunt\" as an excuse to just be rude and inconsiderate.", "NTA it's part of the process of dealing with this, you probably regret it cause it shows some sort of weakness I get that, you are stronger than anyone don't be so hard on yourself, you know more than anyone people don't understand and they don't want to, they want to pretend life is perfect and beautiful, don't let it get to you", "NTA-one of the only \u2018good\u2019 (note the air quotes) things about cancer is how it can shut up rude people. You were extremely patient with someone making comments they had no right to make, and it\u2019s not like you lied. She\u2019s right to be embarrassed and hopefully it teaches her to mind her manners.\n\nI\u2019m almost five years NED now, but whenn I was first diagnosed there was a particularly misogynistic jerk at work who liked to comment on women\u2019s bodies. I\u2019m naturally thin, but lost 20 pounds due to colon cancer\u2014I looked awful, but he complimented my weight loss. I responded with a super cheery \u201cThanks, it\u2019s the cancer!\u201d and he completely lost it\u2014yelling about how gross I was for talking about cancer,he even complained to HR that I\u2019d created a hostile work environment by embarrassing him.\n\nTurns out complaining about a colleague having  cancer gets people fired real fast.\n\nYour brothers gf should take this as a lesson learned to stop hiding her rudeness behind claiming to be blunt and learn som manners. It\u2019s not a cute quirk, she\u2019s just rude, and someday someone was going to call her on it. She should be glad that she learned this lesson where the only consequences were embarrassment and leaving a party early.\n\nAlso, f*ck cancer\u2014wishing you all the best!", "NTA. She should have stopped while she was ahead.", "NTA. She had no problem making you feel insecure about everything she was nitpicking you about. If she's embarrassed, that's on her. She and your brother owe you an apology for being so insensitive.", "This is a classic example of play stupid games, win stupid prizes. You seem to give her a lot of benefit of doubt that she is just very blunt or something, in reality she's just an AH for relentlessly making disparaging comments about you. I hope she felt deep shame, though I doubt it because most AHs are oblivious and I'm sure she sees herself as the victim here. You are NTA.", "Nta. Text your brother the link to this post and told him your waiting for an apology from both of them.", "NTA\n\nOne \"well-meaning\" but insulting comment is a mistake, multiple is an attack. Stop excusing her behavior with euphemisms like \"lacking social mores\", \"blunt\" or \"genuine\". \n\nShe's a catty bully and she reaped what she sowed.", "NTA But I want to add in if you want to keep your hair, you can try cold capping. I do it now because it does wreck you emotionally for the last thing you have control over to be snatched from you. There\u2019s also financial assistance available if you make below a certain amount. So far I\u2019ve kept my hair since May of last year (I\u2019m a lifer) and has even grown a bit. Best money I spent on my mental health.", "NTA. Good luck with your treatments.", "NTA \u2026 but I want to throw out the idea that the girlfriend thought that you were pregnant and was giving you terrible openings to tell her privately. If she understands the extent of your previous bout with cancer and understands how that has impacted your fertility fully, ignore what I am saying. But if there\u2019s any chance that she thinks you could have a miracle baby, that might be what was happening. \n\nIf she\u2019s normally a sweetheart but blunt, it explains A LOT (the haircut comments about your face being round was hinting at pregnancy weight (and she brought up the jewelry to bring it back to your haircut and those your supposed pregnancy weight) and it explains her repeatedly asking about the drinking). \n\nShe absolutely could just be mean, but I could absolutely see someone who is typically blunt not have any clue how to subtly hint at a pregnancy. And then of course she had totally stepped in it because it turns out that you are fighting cancer, not expecting a child.\n\nEDIT: I hope nothing but the best for you in your new cancer fight!", "You\u2019re nta but also I don\u2019t think your brother was wrong either for wanting his moment. You had every right to say what you did and I think she was very rude, there\u2019s no getting around that at all. She shouldn\u2019t have made any of those comments. I probably would\u2019ve done the same thing as you, but I understand why he\u2019s upset too.", "INFO: was SIL being deliberately malicious or is she just generally socially blunt? \n\nAlso is she autistic or otherwise have a disability?", "ESH.  The girlfriend sounds awful badgering people about this and that.  But you probably should have told them ahead of time about the cancer.

Your brother should have pulled his girlfriend aside way before it ever got to the point of you snapping and told her to have better manners.

I don't care if she's from a culture that constantly insults people. She was visiting in your culture.
