Even after treatment, after remission, I found that I felt empowered by my new hairstyle (mostly what it meant to me) and kept it short. Recently I\u2019ve been diagnosed with vaginal cancer.

This upset has led me to be tetchy.\u00a0\n\nMy brother and his new girlfriend and newborn flew in for a visit, for the first time since the baby was born.\u00a0 This is the first time in years we\u2019ve seen him, except for video calls, because they\u2019re out of country now. She\u2019s a sweetheart but kind of blunt. Over the course of the party: She pointed out that my haircut made my face look round - but that\u2019s the chemo causing fluid build up. She asked me multiple times if I was sure I didn\u2019t want a drink, mostly because she was also getting herself one. She also said I was very confident to avoid wearing jewelry with such short hair; again she is a little lacking in social mores but still she\u2019s very genuine in what she says.\u00a0\n\nI just got sick of answering questions about my lack of alcohol, about my haircut, about my face, so I snapped, admittedly. After she commented about my hair again I said, \u201cI have cancer\u201d very bluntly and too loudly.\u00a0Many people overheard, which caused many eyes to turn onto us, during a party that was meant for my brother and his girlfriend.\u00a0\n\nMy brother took me aside after everyone else had left the house and his GF was in the car.

It\u2019s not a cute quirk, she\u2019s just rude, and someday someone was going to call her on it.

What he should have done as your brother is take you in his arms and give you a supporting hug and let you know that he and his family are behind you 100% in your second fight.", "NTA I just cut my hair buzz cut short today after having long hair my whole life in preparation for my cancer treatment. Is it wrong that I kind of secretly hope someone makes a rude comment so I have someone to snap on? In reality, I probably wouldn't, but if I did, I would still feel justified, especially in your situation.", "NTA and babe I am autistic as FUCK and even I know not to do shit like that. What the fuck. She's definitely very courageous in her rudeness and if that's her journey she can keep stepping on rakes.", "NTA.\n\nYour brother could have grown a spine and told his girlfriend to shut up about a topic you no longer wanted to address.", "NTA. You have cancer. Cancer. You were being picked at, she had no reason to keep on and on about your appearance or whether or not you wanted to drink. Not drinking should never be picked at, and anyone who pushes when you say no or deny drinking is 100% an asshole. Anyone in your situation would snap. \n\nThe fact of the matter is that you have cancer. The big C. You're going through a battle that takes many if not most who fight in it. Be it now, or x-years from now after a failure of remission. \n\nEveryone has a snapping point when they're being harassed. Hitting yours does not make you an AH. And while you maybe said it too loud it's not like you went on a whole rant or anything. \n\nYou are definitely NTA but your bro and SIL need to sit and re-evaluate themselves.", "EHS. You said you know she's a genuine sweetheart. You could've just pulled her to the side, privately told her about your situation.\n\nCancer or not, people like your bros GF should be more careful if not sensitive, making comments about someone.\n\nAnyways, this will pass.", "NTA\n\nShe\u2019s rude and inconsiderate. Blunt does not mean socially inept. There is a difference.", "The blunt, repeated comments that OP said were genuine make me wonder if the girl is on the spectrum. There's a comedian, Rick Glassman, who is on the spectrum but didn't know until recently. His story really opened my eyes to a few people I thought were completely oblivious on how to be a normal person.... They actually might be legitimately obvious. What opened his eyes was no one wanting to play pickup basketball with him because he was WAY too aggressive for what they wanted. It took someone telling him exactly that to realize he didn't pick up on any of the groans, mumbles, WTF glances, etc. He needs it plainly explained. \n\nOf course... That initial conversation explaining things may not be pleasant.  \n\n\"You're not wrong, Walter, you're just an asshole\".... But more like, \"You're not wrong, Walter, you're just mentally incapable of picking up on subtle social cues, which can make you come off as an asshole.\"\n\nOr she could just be an obvious asshole \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af", "The brother is such an AH. Like seriously this is the response you have to all this? \n\nObvi the sis in law is too, but I think she must be an alien from hell, because there\u2019s no way a human would be that rude", "Amen to that sista.", "The only time it\u2019s okay to comment on someone\u2019s appearance is if it can be fixed in less than 10 seconds. Like don\u2019t let someone walk around with obvious food in their teeth. Or if an earring is falling out or a shoe is untied, an unzipped fly or other zipper. Then yes tell them anything else leave it alone", "Maybe it is bluntness but I can't help but feel like that's just a cover. Like an excuse to be rude to people and get away with it. The way SIL was talking made it sound like she didn't like OP's appearance with short hair and was snidely passing judgment but when confronted would inevitably say, \"Oh! Sorry you got offended! I didn't mean anything by it that's just how I am, I'm kind of straightforward.\"", "Yup. The gf strikes me as being one of those people who attempts to cut you deep with the old \"Oh wow! I would NEVER have the courage to wear that if I was your age/size/whatever fucking thing they've chosen as a target. Good for you!\" And you're just like \"uh huh, yeah, thanks\" \ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude12 \nI'm so glad your ex co-worker got what was coming to him and hope your good health continues!", "NTA - I wouldn't count on her learning a lesson.  I've known people who just can't stop expressing their opinions, often the same opinion over and over, even when they've been asked both nicely and bluntly to stop.   When one of them finally realized that yes, I was genuinely angry about her intrusiveness, she vowed never to speak to me again.\n\nI'm holding her to it.", "My first thought when I saw the other country mentioned was that it was probably cultural.  Some countries do make very blunt statements and consider it the norm.  The OP is not def NTA.  I put more blame on the brother than the GF.  The GFs statements were rude, whether she realized it or was oblivious.  The brother did the chastising of the OP for defending herself too loudly.  That\u2019s absurd.  And following it up with \u201cyou took attention away from us\u201d really seals the deal.  I think he needs to go back to his country of residence sooner rather than later because the OP doesn\u2019t need this drama.  Her energy is for her life and her medical treatments.  OP can\u2019t afford to spend any on manufactured drama.", "Your comment lacks logic. If she simply answered the question or was transparent it wouldn\u2019t have been an issue. Her yelling it a party out of anger is the issue.", "I think what we need more info on is that if OP expressed they were uncomfortable. I mean if they did its SIL's the AH no matter what, I'm autistic I have very strict boundaries, some Autistic people don't understand boundaries sure but if someone expresses discomfort with a question it doesn't matter if your socially blunt. You need to let the other person be. But that's my own personal opinion.", "A woman is an asshole and the leap made in her defense is \u201cmaybe she\u2019s autistic and doesn\u2019t know better\u201d \ud83e\udd74", "Its sounds like oh you have flu again. Withnthe increased survival rate people have forgotten 2hat a deadly disease it is. We dont read cancer cure rates, we read 5 year and 10 year survival rates when reading about cancer. A single cell left out may make it happen all over again.", "Yeah. Like.. \"How dare you ruin MY party with your cancer!\"", ">there\u2019s no way a human would be that rude\n\nMaybe it's down to them being exhausted new parents who are on an international trip with an infant, and OP's brother and his new wife aren't simply horrible people.  But I confess I'm not overly hopeful about that from what's here.  \n\nOP, NTA, and best of luck with your treatment.", "\ud83c\udf82\ud83c\udf88", "Agreed, and NTA", "I'm agreeing with you. \n\n\"I'm brutally honest! It's always good to be honest!\"\n\nNah, don't need to be brutal at all. And social niceties, you don't need to be honest about your opinion on someone's face, which they can't change. Look for things you find pleasant, to comment on. Or, \"if you can't say something nice, don't say Nuthin at all!\" - Thumper \n\nIt's the same as if you forgot someone's name. You can nicely ask them, or you can avoid using it", "I must have missed the memo that if someone else has announcements you must allow yourself to be insulted and browbeaten lest you risk stealing the spotlight. So glad OP's brother brought it to my attention!", "Ok. I was giving my opinion. Shocking that someone who has cancer and is actively undergoing chemo lacks some logic. Thanks dude. OP told SIL the reason she has short hair, the reason her face is puffy, etc. SIL should\u2019ve minded her own business.", "Yeah, it seems like she was just smiling and not really saying \u2018hey please stop\u2019. If so and then she just left it until she explored she\u2019s TA a little bit. If SIL knew and kept going she\u2019s TA. But the \u2018she pointed out my face is round\u2019 - doesn\u2019t say that she quietly said \u2018yeah it\u2019s the chemo\u2019. It\u2019s also unclear if SIL even knew she had cancer", "All I did was call you ugly! Why are you being so mean by having cancer AGAIN at such an inconvenient time!", "I\u2019ve been an exhausted new parent traveling internationally before and I\u2019ve never continuously told someone I hate the way they look. Sorry but that\u2019s a BS excuse for her, she\u2019s rotten.", "OP should have acted like an adult.\n\nAnd You\u2019re welcome bro.", "It was more than one comment though.", "And she kept trying to be nice and offer drinks. Both were rude imo.", "Continuously pestering someone about alcohol when they already said no is not a nice thing to do", "INFO: does chemo cause you to not be able to drink? \n\nOnly asking because I don't know. I never question a non-drinker because there are a million reasons someone might not drink, none of which are my business.\n\nSo, just curious. Don't answer if you don't want to, and if anyone else wants to chime in, I'm all ears.\n\nNTA regardless.", "YTA your hair is short because you choose to keep it short. You literally say so in your post. Your attitude is frankly vile.", "NTA. Your brothers comment clearly shows he has no idea your girlfriend was harassing you.

NTA", "NTA, she sounds like a shit person.", "NTA - I did that once when someone would not stop asking me about the \u2018secret of my weight loss\u2019.  I demurred twice then the third time told her I got type 1 diabetes which had some nasty additional side effects so I wouldn\u2019t recommend it as a diet. I was only about 6 months out from diagnosis and had started losing my hair and realizing the grind of managing chronic illness, so I had a lot of rage. I have no regrets. My mom always says not to ask a question unless you\u2019re prepared for every possible answer.", "you\u2019re NTA", "NTA.

YOU didn't make the scene; she did, by pushing and pushing and pushing. Your telling her the truth was probably the only way to get her to back off. It's unfortunate that it happened during a lull in the conversation, but that's in no way your fault. GF needs to learn to pay attention to cues.", "NTA", "NTA. \n\nShe asked a question, you gave an answer. It's not your fault that she didn't like that answer.", "Nta. She is making wayyyy too many comments on your appearance and for what??", "NTA.   I'd have done the same in your shoes.  Probably would have had fallout from someone for bringing up such a serious topic, but it's not like you planned to say anything.  Hope you get better soon.", "NTA.  She was being blunt and so you were blunt.  And it worked, it made her realize she was annoying you, and she left you alone.

So now I know another word for 'irritable'.", "This one!", "The way it was explained to me was that there could be interactions between alcohol and my chemotherapy or the drugs I use to manage the side effects (like anxiety and nausea) that would make drinking a bad idea in general.", "Me too. This wasn\u2019t the time or place I would\u2019ve wanted to tell people about my diagnosis, even on a personal level.

Again, I would never question anyone's choice to not drink, and I know I could Google reasons to not drink, but I think it's helpful for me to know what done of the background reasons might be.\n\nThank you again for the answer, and I wish you all the best.", "No I\u2019m good. Having cancer isn\u2019t an excuse to be an AH.

It just makes neurodivergent people sound horrific and adds to stigma. I have met so, so many autistic people at this point and not one has been outright horrible.
