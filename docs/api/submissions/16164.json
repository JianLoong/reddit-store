Even after treatment, after remission, I found that I felt empowered by my new hairstyle (mostly what it meant to me) and kept it short. Recently I\u2019ve been diagnosed with vaginal cancer. Thankfully we caught it early so hopes are high, but I won\u2019t lie that I\u2019m not upset that this is happening to me again. This upset has led me to be tetchy.\u00a0\n\nMy brother and his new girlfriend and newborn flew in for a visit, for the first time since the baby was born.\u00a0 This is the first time in years we\u2019ve seen him, except for video calls, because they\u2019re out of country now. She\u2019s a sweetheart but kind of blunt. Over the course of the party: She pointed out that my haircut made my face look round - but that\u2019s the chemo causing fluid build up. She asked me multiple times if I was sure I didn\u2019t want a drink, mostly because she was also getting herself one. She also said I was very confident to avoid wearing jewelry with such short hair; again she is a little lacking in social mores but still she\u2019s very genuine in what she says.\u00a0\n\nI just got sick of answering questions about my lack of alcohol, about my haircut, about my face, so I snapped, admittedly. After she commented about my hair again I said, \u201cI have cancer\u201d very bluntly and too loudly.\u00a0Many people overheard, which caused many eyes to turn onto us, during a party that was meant for my brother and his girlfriend.\u00a0\n\nMy brother took me aside after everyone else had left the house and his GF was in the car.

It\u2019s not a cute quirk, she\u2019s just rude, and someday someone was going to call her on it.

But if there\u2019s any chance that she thinks you could have a miracle baby, that might be what was happening. \n\nIf she\u2019s normally a sweetheart but blunt, it explains A LOT (the haircut comments about your face being round was hinting at pregnancy weight (and she brought up the jewelry to bring it back to your haircut and those your supposed pregnancy weight) and it explains her repeatedly asking about the drinking). \n\nShe absolutely could just be mean, but I could absolutely see someone who is typically blunt not have any clue how to subtly hint at a pregnancy.

Sometimes it is nice to have some anecdotal evidence since in my profession I have met countless wonderful autistic people, and I cannot speak from personal experience as an allistic person.\n\nMy point is that misunderstanding social cues =/= being repeatedly cruel. Coming across as rude by misunderstanding a social cue CAN be a symptom of autism, being nasty to someone of their own accord is not.\n\nThe fact that someone has heard a story of someone being nasty to one person and immediately thought \"this could be autism!\" is really alarming when you think about it. \n\nAlso, not all people with ADHD or autism are bad at social interaction! Most of the time, autistic people who experience struggles with social interaction are the kindest, most polite people to have a conversation with because they are making a conscious effort (again, speaking from experience, some not all).\n\nWe need to tackle misinformation, and people who are meaning well but adding to stigma need to become more aware.

It feels like for you, this is something you might have experience with, like someone blindsided you with heavy information either accidentally or to push you away, and now you are intertwining the hurt, shock and fear you felt then to this post now. \n\nI appreciate and hear you telling me that I should have found the time to take her aside before I reached my boiling point. My stress should not be a shield to hide behind if my actions or words hurt someone.

Ok, Good to know? How do u even respond to that. After the first time, what did she want from OP? To really drill in how round her face was? Make her say \u201cyou\u2019re right! I\u2019ll grow it out immediately!\u201d. Even if we don\u2019t call it an intrusive question, what could she gain from commenting more than once other than being an asshole or wanting a reaction.

Seems understandable to me.", "I think there may be a couple of reasons why\n\nWe naturally look for other people with our diagnoses.
