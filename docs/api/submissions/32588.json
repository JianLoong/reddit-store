I would have my hackles up and be looking for evidence that this was pre-planned. He\u2019s positively gleeful one moment and then lashing out at you the next (classic guilty behavior). \n\nA real partner would have been conflicted about leaving. Would have told his mom to go ahead before him so he could sort out finding you a mother\u2019s helper or night nurse while he\u2019s away.

I hope you find local support and more friends to surround yourself with soon, because this is not a good situation.", "This would be a dealbreaker for me. This was so selfish of him to abandon you and your child. This is what it is, abandonment. Might as well be on your own if he\u2019s going to leave you on your own. I\u2019m so sorry; you deserve better.", "This would be the moment I seriously re-evaluated my marriage. This would be the moment I chose me and my child and put both FIRST if I haven't already. Your husband is a fool.", "NTA. Your husband is a jerk.", "Ah, typical nonsense from a typical Reddit user.  \n\nRecovering from a c-section doesn't give her the right to be dismissive of what is believed to be a dying grandparent.  Full stop. Nothing else matters in terms of whether OP is an AH or not.  She is. \n\nThe husband was also an AH after it became clear the grandfather was not dying, which is why this is an ESH. Up to that point, he was full having to choose between a dying grandparent (as far as he knew) and a wife recovering from a C-section, but who was not imminently expected to die. Definitely an uncomfortable position to be in - either choice could have been understandable. \n\nBut, I suppose we could take your approach to life - one cannot possibly understand a situation unless one has experienced the exact circumstances that are in play.  None of us can use life experiences to empathy, logic, or knowledge to understand.  No, we must have experienced it exactly or the input has no value. \n\nGood luck getting through life with that asinine attitude."]}
