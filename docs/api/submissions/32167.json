(Should be obvious when you marry someone with kids, but\u2026)\n\nAnyway, several years ago we went on a family vacation and Dad rented a house on the beach in South Carolina. My brother and SIL brought their 3 year old daughter. I don\u2019t have kids, so the 3 year old is the only child in the house.\n\nOne morning, I was sleeping in (because I\u2019m on vacation!) and I hear a horrible scream from the first floor. I go running downstairs to find my niece hysterical because \u201cGrandma\u201d/StepMonster left her alone in the house. My Dad, brother and his wife were not up but my niece got up super early for once.  Important note - there was a pot of hot coffee on and of course Atlantic Ocean was 30 feet from the door. It was about 7:30am.\n\nI calmed my niece down and woke up my brother. StepMonster had gone for a walk on the beach. I ran out after her and said \u201cDid you leave a 3 year old alone in the house?\u201d And she responded that the parents \u201cshould\u2019ve been awake and watching their child.\u201d\n\nI agree that parents are responsible for their child\u2026SO GO WAKE THEM UP BEFORE YOU LEAVE. Or wake me up - I\u2019ll take care of the kid. But you don\u2019t leave a 3-year old alone in a strange house with hot coffee, other hazards and a damn ocean right out the door! (My niece was known to be fearless and would be prone to jump in the water just because.)\n\nSo\u2026was I the asshole for yelling at StepMonster? I got a lot of flack from my Dad for \u201cstarting trouble\u201d and \u201cruining\u201d the vacation and I am still, years later, hearing about this.

I watched her interact appropriately with the dog and then get bit!)

It's the parents? \ud83e\udd14 \n\nNice one here. The good old \"it takes a village\" doesn't count much these days. \n\nAs said the parents did wrong. But OP didn't ask that. She asked if she was wrong to call out step mom. And I see it that way if there's a kid unsupervised and you're the only adult you are at least responsible to go get someone who takes over from you. \n\nMany judges see it the same btw at least where I'm from. \n\nYou are responsible even if you're not related to the kid or even living with kid. Where I'm from you can be taken to court if you see a child being abused or neglected or wandering off unsupervised and you don't do something. Even if it's the neighbors kid and not a kid of your household. \n\nI don't know where you're from but that's how it is where I'm from.", "This!", "Nothing Reddit's childfree contingent hates more than to hear they are part of a society and that includes protecting and looking out for the weak and vulnerable, even they are unrelated to you. That's that American=based toxic individualism of \"no one ever owes you anything at all\" taken to the extreme.", "I am not childfree, but blaming stepmom here is ridiculous. It is more that I do have my own kids and I am frequently in presence of families with kids. Their kid waking up before parents does not imply I have to interact with anyone normally."]}
