She doesn't like certain textures and they often cause her to be more difficult. wanted to have something there for her since she doesn't like the texture of cake and it can be very triggering for her.

What kind of pastry do you need and should we put a message?\n\nMe: Well I was wondering if you could make chocolate chip cookies without the chocolate chips in them. It's for my daughter's birthday and she doesn't like the texture the chocolate chips bring to the cookie.\n\nB: Are you being serious?\n\nMe: I'm being extremely serious. Can you guys make chocolate chip cookies with no chocolate chips for a party of 10?\n\nB: You want chocolate chip cookies with no chocolate chips? *laughs*\n\nMe: Yes I do, can I pick it up by Thursday?\n\nB: This has got to be a prank call. *hangs up*\n\nSo now here I am in the kitchen at almost 12 am trying to make my daughter some chocolate chip cookies without adding chocolate chips in.\n\nEdit: Thank you all so much for your help and recipes.

Please use chocolate chip cookie batter, but do not add the chips.\"  This also would go over better in person than in a phone call.", "NAH, but maybe you should've changed how you made the order. Like maybe start by telling them that your request might sound a bit unusual but to let you explain first. Then tell them what the order is and why it needs to be that way. Don't just automatically launch into saying you need chocolate chip cookies without chocolate chips in them. People will rightly assume that you're pulling a prank.", "NAH. They aren't for thinking it's a prank and you aren't for asking either. \n\n\nInfo is there a reason you didn't ask for sugar cookies ? Or a cookie with no add ins ? Saying I'd like a chocolate chip cookies with our the chips is an odd phasing. While I understand you want a plain cookie. There were probably better ways to explain what you wanted with out that.

I'm happy to pay for them over the phone so you know I'm not joking\"", "NAH. \n\nThey just assumed that it would be a prank or some tiktok BS because that's what's happening right now everywhere and i can understand their perspective. \n\nThat being said you aren't an asshole either because you wanted something special for your kid. Maybe you could have gone up there and spoke to them or maybe called them up again and explained the reason for your order I'm sure they would do it. \nAlso I'm sure your daughter would love the chocolate chip cookies without chocolate that you are making for her because that will be filled with extra love (\u2060\u00b4\u2060\u03b5\u2060\uff40\u2060\u00a0\u2060)", "NTA.

It's similar to a sugar cookie but with brown sugar, and imho, better.  A lot of people are surprisingly averse to the idea, so I guess that's why the bakery thought it was a prank, but I do think they could've been a lot less rude about it.  \n\n*Link Neal of Good Mythical Morning would approve of this message if no one else does", "NTA.  They were! I often get pizza with no tomato sauce before white pizza was a thing in our area.  Next time, go in person and order to pay up front. Just go to a different bakery.  And feel free to place the name of the bakery on social media.", "Try looking up a brown sugar sugar cookie.", "The thing is, the batter might be pre-made. I worked at a cookie cake company and all our dough came to us on a truck. There is no way we could have fulfilled a request like this. I probably would have asked if a sugar cookie would work instead. \n\nThe other thing is that people who work in these jobs DO get ridiculous requests. Yours had a valid reason, OP, but some don't. We once had a lady who kept asking if we were SURE we couldn't just sell her the cookie cake on display imstead of making her one in an hour, EVEN AFTER WE TOLD HER THE DISPLAY CAKE WAS PLASTIC AND NOT EDIBLE. We also got jokesters a lot, so I see where the employee was coming from. NAH It was fine for you to ask. The employee maybe could've been nicer about it, but you might be the umpteenth person to ask for chocolate chip cookies without chocolate chips and they probably did think you were wasting their time.", "She only likes cookies from the same batter as chocolate chip cookies since her mother used to make them all the time for her.

There are different ratios of ingredients as well.", "My daughter and I are both allergic to vanilla (an ingredient in sugar cookies). She also requested loud and proud that she wanted chocolate chip cookies and I want to make this birthday special since it's the first without her mother.", "Then they should have explained that their batter is premade and fulfilling the request would not be possible. Laughing and saying it must be a prank before hanging up is just rude, and I can't imagine OP going to this bakery after that.", "Seeing the comment that this is the first birthday without her mom, you got this OP, and the thought alone shows how caring you are. \n\nMake sure you ask about Vanilla tho, it's in every chocolate chip cookie recipe I've ever made. Not sure how good a baker you are, but i bet you could do it! My fav cookie is my mom's chocolate chip cookies w/o chips but with oatmeal. Everyone tells me it's weird but who cares.", "I see in a comment you bought dough and are allergic to vanilla.  If you are indeed allergic to vanilla extract do not eat them ! And if you order from a bakery you absolutely need to tell them yout allergy. Alot of baking involves vanilla. There are things you can substitute for some easier than others.", "I'm with you, sugar cookies are not the same thing as chip-less cookies.\n\nYou know what's funny? When I was a small child, I was exactly the same way. Whenever my mom made chocolate chip cookies, she'd make a few without the chips for me.

I have made them with all sorts of other flavorings. And to get the chocolate chip cookie-ish flavor you can use brown and white sugar.", "Then it's a good thing you're making the cookies yourself because chocolate chip cookies (the cookie part) usually have vanilla extract in them.\n\nNTA", "My guy....

I hope he reads the ingredients.", "awesome! vanilla isn\u2019t an ingredient necessary for any chemical reaction so you should be pretty flexible. if you want a little flavor boost since you won\u2019t have that or chocolate, my favorite add-ins are a little bit of cinnamon or orange zest! you\u2019ve got this sensory-challenged baker rooting for you, good luck!", "OK, but there were ingredients used to make that cookie dough...and if the bakery had made \"chocolate chip less chocolate chip cookies\" for your daughter, there's a good chance those cookies would have had vanilla extract in them.", "Almost all cookie dough has vanilla in it. Besides providing flavor, it enhances flavors in other ingredients where it is not the star of the show so to speak.", "You should probably check the ingredients.", "I saw that you bought pre-made dough so check the ingredients. \n\nMost baked goods have vanilla in them.

It just sounded like a prank call", "NAH\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut you really made it sound like a prank call.", "NTA I think it\u2019s just a communication error. It\u2019s not a chocolate chips cookie if it doesn\u2019t have chocolate chips in it.. then it\u2019s just a normal plain cookie.

NTA, but why didn't you just ask for cookies?", "NTA, my late husband\u2019s favorite cookie was chocolate chip cookies without the chips. This is not unheard of. It was rude for her to laugh and hang up the phone instead of asking more questions. How many people are really pranking bakeries?", ">  i can whip up batch\n\n...for some reason, it just occurred to me: why do Americans use the phrase 'to whip something up' when they're talking about cooking?  Is there something in American history that would cause the act of whipping to be associated with domestic chores?", "If it was the first time someone had asked then I could see the baker doing that.
