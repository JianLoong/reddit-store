NAH", "NTA, I\u2019d personally leave a review of the business with this information. They could have easily asked more questions to determine that this wasn\u2019t a prank. They were unprofessional and rude. That isn\u2019t okay.", "Hey dude I know you\u2019ve gotten a lot of comments already but making chocolate chip cookies without the chips is actually a super easy and fun recipe! It could be a good way to teach your daughter about baking, a helpful life skill for anyone, while you are practicing yourself. It\u2019s also great for teaching math. Of course whether that\u2019s useful depends on your daughter\u2019s needs as a child with autism so it may not apply.\n\nTo make these cookies, all you need is eggs, flour, sugar, baking soda, butter, salt. That\u2019s it. (I have pre-removed the vanilla for you :).\n\nYou mix the flour, baking soda, and salt together in a big bowl. Then make a nice hole in the center of the dry mix, like brush it into a donut shape so there\u2019s a well in it. \n\nSeparately you melt the butter until it\u2019s liquidy but not burnt, and mix in the sugar. Add the eggs and whisk. (Or use a fork it\u2019s fine!) Until it\u2019s blended but looks like a kind of sandy butter.\n\nPour the wet mix into the well in the middle of the dry mix. Then start mixing the dry into the wet a little at a time. Just do this until it\u2019s all smooth dough and you don\u2019t see any powder, then stop right there. \n\nThen you plop small balls onto aluminum foil on a tray and throw \u2018em in the oven for like 10-14 min. Helps if you grease the foil with butter first.\n\nEverything else like oven temperature and exact amount of ingredients is all a recipe-to-recipe thing but these basic steps are all you need to do. You will learn with reading and practice about how ingredients and temperature affect the crispy or chewiness. \n\nSo pick a recipe off Google to get the ingredients amounts, oven temperature and time and just remember the steps above are really all you need to do. \n\nI\u2019m rooting for you :) you\u2019re a great dad!", "NAH. Obviously you are not an AH trying to do this for your kid, more like the exact opposite, but I can see how your wording did make it sound like a prank call.

Also if you need to avoid vanilla due to an allergy then getting things from a bakery or premade dough likely would have vanilla so that is important to check on the ingredients.\n\nI hope your daughter has a nice birthday. Even if the cookies you make are not perfect I\u2019m sure your daughter will appreciate you trying. She might like to help make the cookies too.", "Chocolate chip cookie dough tastes way different from sugar cookies. It's made with brown sugar and more flour and more butter. \n\nHe explained his daughter wanted the taste of the cookies but can't handle the texture of the chocolate chips. I agree there was probably a better way to phrase it so they didn't think it was a prank and it probably would have been best in person. Honestly he's probably better off finding a good recipe and just omitting the chocolate chips. He'll save money and have a recipe for cookies anytime.", "I always assumed it was because before baking powder was a thing, most recipes got their rise from whipped eggs. You\u2019re whipping *the food*, not the people making the food.\n\nBut I could be naively wrong.\n\nEdit: right, so there are two meanings of \u201cwhip up\u201d. One is for cooking, and yes, the origin of that phrase likely comes from whipping eggs or cream during baking. However, you can also \u201cwhip up\u201d interest or political fervour, and yes, that refers to an actual whip which might be directing cattle (or blech, people). When parties in an English parliamentary system are made to vote all together, the vote has been \u201cwhipped\u201d.", "Going in and paying up front would probably be the way to go.

They make hundreds at a time. This isn\u2019t an easy ask, even if it might seem to be - and the opportunity cost to do it for a bakery (assuming they can, and don\u2019t have prepare batches of dough only on hand) would make the price seem obscene to Joe Cookie Buyer.

But it just isn\u2019t a reasonable request for the vast majority of bakeries.", "Chocolate chip dough is very different from sugar cookie dough.", "I worked at a small bakery, and while everything was made from scratch, the basic chocolate chip cookie recipe made around 150 cookies which we would pre scoop and freeze. So even if they had the time to make the dough from scratch (which alone might be a stretch because prep work takes time)  it might be impossible for them to cut down the recipe enough to make it worthwhile for them to bake 20 cookies", "Oh man. They are not. Completely different batter. I'm not a huge fan of sugar cookies either.", "The employee would've been better off to had said it was impossible, due to X, than hanging up.\n\nDad is a champ though, because he's going to try his hand at making them. \u2764\ufe0f", "Me too! And I get weird looks all the time as well....", "NTA -- and frankly neither is the clerk at the bakery.  Respectfully, you didn't communicate your needs well and the clerk wasn't out of line thinking it was some kind of prank.  As others have mentioned, you should have LED with the why of your request and could have immediately called back and asked for a manager/owner and explained your request.    \n\n\nI'm sure your cookies will turn out great!", "Obviously. I was only asking because there may have been other options. But op also has a child with an allergy to vanilla so in the end this situation was the best because he didn't give his child something she is allergic to. I also mention cookie with no adds ins which is basically what he wanted", "I absolutely sympathize with your challenges.  As someone who speaks multiple languages, I empathize with the language barrier.  I hope you got something nice for your daughter.\n\nIf you feel the baker is rude and unfriendly, go elsewhere, you shouldn't have to take harassment.  However, if you take some time and just explain the situation slowly, I think most good bakers will work with you.\n\nI might have read too much into your situation (I have seen too many situations where a parent makes it more about them than the child).  I sincerely wish you and your daughter the best.", " She also requested loud and proud that she wanted chocolate chip cookies.", "[removed]", "I hope the cookies you bake are delicious and she has a wonderful time!!!", "Considering when I have worked fast food, yes, it is different from a bakery, has taken plenty of prank like or crazy orders, and never laughed at a customer. \n\nThe bakery could have said no, we don't do that, or we can do that. Not laugh at someone.", "NTA, but bakery is. I wold hit them with bad reviews explaing your daughters medical issues as to why you wanted Chocolate chipless cookies.\n\nhttps://www.vice.com/en/article/xwwp5k/what-the-heck-do-you-call-a-chocolate-chip-cookie-without-chocolate-chips", "Not a ridiculous request at all, but the problem is that OP keeps saying \"*chocolate chip cookies* without the chocolate chips\".  Once, I can get it, but he keeps saying \"*chocolate chip cookies*\".  This does indeed sound like a joke to the bakery.  Dude...  with no chocolate chips, they aren't chocolate chip cookies.  Just ask them to make \"cookies with the same batter as they would use for chocolate chip cookies, but you don't want the chips thrown in...  just the plain cookies.\"  It's easy to explain and easy to understand.", "Honestly the cookie part of the chocolate chip cookie is the best. I regularly make them with out chocolate chips.", "NTA These are my favorite and I have a friend who also makes these! There is no weirdness. Sorry you had to deal with people like this.", "The outpouring of support is wonderful! Not just for the birthday girl and her awesome dad, but for all of us who\u2019ve spent our lives thinking we\u2019re weird or something just because we don\u2019t like the chocolate chips in chocolate chip cookies. I love chocolate. I love cookies. Why don\u2019t I don\u2019t like chocolate chips *in* my cookies? No idea. Totally used to love them as a kid, but as an adult if you baked me one dozen \u201cchocolate chip cookies\u201d with zero chocolate chips I would be totally happy\n\nNAH -of course they thought it was a prank, can\u2019t blame them\n\n**HAPPY BIRTHDAY!**", "This is very valid. I dont have sensory issues that extreme but i do have certain things texture wise i dont like. Shame on that bakery for not accommodating...", "NTA\n\nAnd you are an amazing father.", "why \"chocolate chip cookies with no chocolate chips\" when you could say just \"cookies\" or \"plain cookies?", "NAH and I hope things turn(ed?) out well!  I actually prefer my chocolate chip cookies like your daughter does--though I've always called them naked choco-chip (because chocolate chipless chocolate chip cookies are a mouthful).\n\nIf you haven't made them yet, might I suggest browning some butter for the recipe?  It really adds a nice lil extra flavor to the cookie.  But if your wife had a recipe, stick to that.  Best of luck!", "NTA", "NTA\n\nI'm the same way.  I love a chocolate chip cookie batter without the chips.  Easiest way I've found to do to make a lot at once is just get the box mix packages, pour it into a colander set over your mixing bowl, and shake shake shake.  The dry stuff goes in the bowl and the chips are sifted out, then add your wets and you're good to go.  Easy peasy.", "NTA!! You\u2019re a very sweet father!  You baking them yourself is awesome and I\u2019m sure she will appreciate them even more!", "LOL NTA\n\nI love the cookie part of chocolate chip cookies, but I don't like chocolate and I honestly don't know what chocolate-chip-less cookies are called, so I just call them that, chocolate chip cookies without chocolate chips. By the way, is there an actual name for these?", "NAH\n\nYou made a reasonable request.\n\nBut at the same time, your request does sound like a prank call.\n\nThis was then further compounded by neither party wanting to elaborate - they didn't spend any time trying to figure out if you were a crank call before dismissing you, and it doesn't sound like you tried to justify yourself either.\n\nIt may not be possible to do at all if the batter  comes from elsewhere. You may have special requested a 'plain cookie' by their recipe. Who knows...", "NTA - luckily, it\u2019s not that hard to make chocolate chip free cookies", "Absolutely NAH.\nAnd you win dad of the year for this.", "Why didn't you just say sugar cookies or plain cookies? They are a thing", "Have you heard how hard it is to hire people in the service industry lately? The bakery was probably desperate and hired someone without personal skills and didn't have the time/energy to train them.\n\n\nNTA.", "Well.... if that was how you phrased it, verbatim, I would have thought you were pulling a prank, too!  You wanted a reasonable modification to a food, but you *asked* for an oxymoron.\n\nYTA.\n\n**You wanted cookies made from the standard chocolate chip cookie batter, without any chocolate chips added in.**   If you'd actually said this, the bakery might have done it!\n\nWhile I understand with the context of this post what you were asking for, the man at the bakery didn't have that context.  And **there is no such thing as a chocolate chip cookie without chocolate chips.**  In fact, when you say \"chocolate chip cookie\" you've really only specified that you want a cookie that has chocolate chips in it, not anything about the type of batter that will be used!", "Also, you only need a 3/4 cup! Well, and a teaspoon, and a bowl, and a fork, oh, and a baking pan but still!", "Common sense says they want the batter just not the cchips. Sugar dough isn't the same at all.", "Brown the butter!  heat it over the stove (medium or low heat) til it melts and turns a golden brown and smells nutty--immediately remove from stove (it will change from browned to burn in seconds).  The browned butter adds a nice depth of flavor.  Also, I do a mix of brown sugar and white sugar (you can get away with either/or)--brown sugar just gives it a touch of molasses.", "I'm so glad I'm not the only one!  My family thinks I'm funny for it but since I do most of the baking (well, used to...the older bunch of my nephews have reached an age where they can read recipes and bake with some supervision from their parents now....so I'm now just the auntie who bakes with them for special occasions and who is there trying to guesstimate what I did for a recipe they are asking about) they just kinda laugh and then tuck into the cookies I brought over", "There's a pizza place I like, they have this vegetarian topping that tastes awesome with bacon.

A chain is unlikely to be able to accommodate, but an actual bakery can. Also the employee didn\u2019t say: we can\u2019t do that.", "Cool. Then tell people you can't accommodate them instead of making them feel like an asshole for trying to support your business. That employee was completely out of line.", "literally the most accessible baking recipe EVER! when i first moved apartments i didn\u2019t have any of my measuring cups but we had a scale we use for coffee, and i just converted everything to weight and used that! i\u2019ve fully forgotten ingredients before, fucked up my oven temp etc, and still never had a batch fail", "Have you tried imitation vanilla? My dad couldn\u2019t have vanilla either, so we always used imitation. It\u2019s very good.", "So say that.
