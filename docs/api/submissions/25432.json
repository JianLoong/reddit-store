Your aunt is angry to the point of cussing you out and giving you the silent treatment because your dog died?  Has no one told her about showing compassion for people who are grieving?\n\nI'm so sorry for your loss.", "NTA. I am not putting my dog down any second sooner than I have to, but when that day comes, I am not going to wait for anyone who is out of town to return. My first responsibility is to the dog.\n\nYes, a heads up to prepare the son before he comes over and gets a surprise would have been kind, but this was an unannounced visit. The OP got ambushed. And in this situation, *they're* the chief mourner. They've got their own grief to process. So Aunt's attempt to make the OP responsible for her son's reaction was out of order.", "How utterly rude and insensitive. I'm so sorry for your loss and having this piled on on top of it. NTA", "NTA. Auntie needs to learn that just because her son has a meltdown doesn't mean that she needs to lash out at everyone around her. Sounds like she's actively enabling and rewarding him for having it. They really ought to be ashamed of themselves for putting more stress on someone who just lost a beloved dog. How rude. My jimmies are rustled on your behalf, OP.", "NTA I hope your aunt realises this and apologises to you. It does sound like the aunt and cousin were upset and maybe that motivated being a bit unreasonable in the heat of the moment.", "NTA. Your aunt didn't handle the situation well at all. She needs to prepare her son for things in life like death. Also, who drops by unnannounced. That's a no-no in my world.", "NTA -your dog deserved not to suffer waiting for them and deserved a peaceful ending not a three ring circus focused on their son's grief genuine though it is.", "No, you most certainly are NTA.\n\nI'm sorry for your loss.", "My baby is on his turn downward. Not to the point of being put down. Just aging. I say that to say I\u2019d be devastated if (likely when) the time comes. This is incredibly private and personal. \n\nNTA - I\u2019m so sorry for your loss.", "NTA. It\u2019s pure entitlement to demand to be there.", "No, NTA. Your baby was well-loved, and it's sad that's how she showed her 'caring'. Sorry for your loss.", "NTA - So sorry for your loss :( Your aunt is super insensitive.", "NTA. You were correct on all counts.", "NTA. Her concern should have been for her son, not for blaming you for his reaction. His reaction is understandable just as your choices are; the only AH here is her. \n\nI hope things get easier soon.", "NTA.  I am so sorry for your loss.", "NTA.\nAt the end of it, I'm sure you didn't put your dog through any suffering - when the time comes, my own pets won't wait.\n\nAs a parent with a child on the spectrum, I know these kind of things can be upsetting for them, perhaps warning them in advance might have been a middle ground and avoided the meltdown - a normal child might have gotten sad or cried a bit, but an ASD child can find changes to what they were expecting devastating - they were expecting to see you and play with the dog only to find that not only is the dog not there but won't ever be again.\n A meltdown isn't a tantrum (though they can still have them too), it's an inability to cope with the world and wont resolve till they can understand it, perhaps of all them there, the child was the closest to feeling the way you do about the loss of your beloved dog. \nSo whilst your aunt needs to reel herself in a bit in her expectations, please do bear in mind she's angry because she loves her child and knows that the trauma will haunt them for a while, as your loss will.\nHope you all feel happier soon and know that your dog will be waiting for you a long time in the future :)", "NTA, enjoy the extra downtime, eventually they will get over it and come back into your life with full noise", "Nope not, keep your fingers crossed she stays away.", "NTA. This is a great opportunity to never have to speak to them again. It sounds like knowing them is emotionally exhausting. I would go NC. I'm sorry for your loss. You don't deserve to be made to feel like shit. You're definitely not the AH here.", "No", "NTA for what you said and did, but YTA for the way you said it. \"I am sorry you feel that way, but my primary consideration was for (insert dog name).\"\n\nAlso, your aunt = major asshole.", "YTA only for going to a hostile tone. The aunt was probably very upset for her and her son, and I think honestly you should have let them know that you were planning to put your dog down. I would've given her a heads up even though you were still grieving.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I'm not an idiot. You don't validate meltdowns that are caused by a child not understanding boundaries by yelling at the person who asserted them. That's how you get an autistic child who will grow up into a dangerous adult who does not understand boundaries. You tell the child that you understand why they're upset but they are not entitled to get what they want because that is something that someone else does not have to accommodate them in.", "Noted, but its been long enough after the event that OP has the cremated remains.
