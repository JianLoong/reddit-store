We let them take her, (after lots of kisses, hugs, and tears) and they put her down.

That would have been cruel. My parents were with him to comfort him, and I made the choice that was right for him regardless of how much more it hurt me (hell, I teared up while writing this).\n\n Pets are not toys to be kept around or put away based on convenience, they are living creatures that we owe a duty to.

An issue we saw a lot is that parents would just give up and give in. If that went on long enough, you would eventually have on your hands a mostly feral autistic teenager or adult that is used to having *zero* boundaries and gets their way so long as they are loud and violent.\n\nThis never ends well, it always ends tragically. We had to kick probably about a dozen kids out of the programs I was involved in because they could not stop harassing, assaulting, or even *raping* the other kids. Typically, their targets were the nonverbal ones. Their parents did nothing to stop them.\n\nIt was far past my pay grade, but I did have a friend who specifically worked with autistic adults and teens in the prison and juvenile system. She shared they usually got there as a product of severe neglect from their parents, who never taught them boundaries. The usual charges they picked up? Sex crimes, sometimes even against children. Typically with a history of a bunch of minor assaults nobody bothers to do anything about because they're autistic.\n\nIt's really sad. I understand that parenting children with severe autism is hard work, but you can't simply *not* do it, or you're basically hand-raising someone who will use asocial and criminal behavior to get their way.", "I am so sorry for your loss. \n\nAgree that there is no obligation here, I think the commenter above offered some sensitively worded insight as awareness type info, I didn\u2019t read them as intending it as a \u2018must-do.\u2019 I appreciate the nuances they named that might help me in future interactions with my neurodivergent family. \n\nWishing you the best, and sending healing wishes to all who are navigating these kinds of losses.", "Why did this get downvoted?
