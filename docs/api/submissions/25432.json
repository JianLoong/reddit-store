An issue we saw a lot is that parents would just give up and give in. If that went on long enough, you would eventually have on your hands a mostly feral autistic teenager or adult that is used to having *zero* boundaries and gets their way so long as they are loud and violent.\n\nThis never ends well, it always ends tragically.

She shared they usually got there as a product of severe neglect from their parents, who never taught them boundaries. The usual charges they picked up? Sex crimes, sometimes even against children. Typically with a history of a bunch of minor assaults nobody bothers to do anything about because they're autistic.\n\nIt's really sad.

She thought she was going to get a break, and her kid would be happy and entertained for a while.\n\nInstead of getting a break, she gets a meltdown. \n\nI am so sorry for OPs loss, but also for the Aunt, and for the cousin. \n\nSomeone can be 100% in the wrong and still deserve some sympathy.", "What do you mean by that?", "Op was even more upset. And aunt made it all about her son. Op was right : the world doesn't revolve around her kid", "The kid's autism was likely a genetic gift from her, and she could benefit from the same kind of occupational and speech therapy her son is ostensibly getting", "Omg I am so sorry you had to go through this!", "That person shouldn\u2019t surprise people at home. Not with a child  who melts down. Bad policy.", "Thank you. It was absolutely brutal and I hope I'm never in that situation again!\n\nBut ultimately I know I made the decision that was right for my boy. His comfort was my top priority, I can live with the rest.", "Thank you, it was definitely a horrible experience", "Maybe read all of my comment, or look up the word sympathy.", "Really, for all people. The number of neurotypical adults who cannot accept reasonable boundaries is astounding.", "It is probably getting downvoted because it is excusing the aunt's behavior due to potential autism.\n\nI did not know I was autistic until my son was diagnosed. But, I never screamed at people because he got upset or because I was upset at them. It's just not appropriate behavior and an adult should understand that. \n\nBy yelling at OP she is teaching her son that OP did something wrong. And that it is okay to yell at people when they anger you", "I see. I guess I read the comment as more of a possible explanation, maybe even a path to resolution and understanding, rather than an excuse.", "NTA\nHas your aunt been assisting you with vet bills, food, medication, toys etc for your dog? If the answer is not, let her know she no longer welcome in your home unless she apologized sincerely. Aunt has no compassion or empathy", "[removed]", "NTA and while I understand that she didn't expect to explain death that day, none of this was about your aunt or her son. Had they shown the slightest manners in not just popping in, she wouldn't have caused this whole unnecessary scene for her fuselage and your cousin. \n\nI'm so sorry you lost your doggo. \ud83d\udc94", "NTA. That was YOUR baby and you had every right to make that decision alone. You\u2019re correct, the real world does not revolve around her son; though I suspect *her* world probably does. To make a suffering pets pain last longer than necessary would have been cruel. Putting a pet down is a painful and personal thing, and nobody else outside of that relationship is entitled to share that moment with you. She\u2019s likely not angry about missing it, but is upset about how she\u2019ll have to manage her sons reaction to the change. Which is understandable, but ultimately not your problem.\n\nEdit: just wanted to add that I\u2019m sorry for your loss. We had to put our family dog down a while back due to chronic kidney disease. Whenever I get sad about it I choose to remember the wonderful life that we were able to give her. I like to think she\u2019s experiencing an even better one across that rainbow bridge. If it helps, think of it this way: your girl brought you 14 years of happiness and in return you gave her an eternity of peace. It\u2019ll get easier with time, hang in there and good luck with your family", "Absolutely NTA! Your responsibility was to your dog, and you did right by him.", "NTA. Poor dog doesn't deserve to suffer just because human wanted him to wait", "Your aunt is a massive asshole for not even giving you the time to process all of this while making all of this about her and her son. Everyone has a right to feel affected by your dogs passing, but she isn\u2019t concerned about that, she\u2019s concerned about how she\u2019s going to have to deal with her son\u2019s emotions and that your dog\u2019s passing inconvenienced her trip.", "NTA.  She's full of it.  Ignore her.", "NTA.  The decision to put your dog down is a deeply personal one.  It had nothing to with your aunt or cousin.  You knew it was time.  It's a heart wrenching decision to make.  It's unfortunate that your cousin is upset, but that's not your problem.  No, the world doesn't revolve around her son, and that's an important lesson for them to learn.\nI'm sorry for your loss.  As a fellow pet owner, I've had to make this decision a few times too.  Your Aunt was so wrong to make this about her son instead of understanding your grief.", "Sorry for your loss. I know how hard of a decision it must\u2019ve been. 14 years is a long time for German Shepherd. She\u2019s in heaven now.", "100%NTA", "NTA \n\nSo sorry for your loss. Losing a pet truly and completely sucks.", "NTA-your aunt sounds incredibly entitled. Why would you allow you beloved dog to continue suffering for someone else? Family or not.", "NTA. Support in, vent out. It isn't your job to support your aunt/cousin through the loss of your dog, nor to prioritize their feelings. \n\nIt has been a month, though, and you should have told your parents and let them disseminate the information to affected family members.", "This is the second post in a row where some parent thinks that the rest of the world should act like the world revolves around their child.\n\nI'm pretty sick of it.\n\nNTA\n\nSo sorry about your dog. You had a good one.", "NTA. Everyone grieves differently but your aunt is a special kind of asshole.", "So NTA and I'm sorry for your loss. It's always such a difficult decision & your aunt was completely insensitive.", "NTA at all! I'm autistic, and I understand why your cousin got really upset, but you weren't going to put your dog through immense pain just so he could say goodbye. You could have worded it a little bit better, but I understand you are grieving and your aunt's behavior was just another pile of cement on the truckload of sadness and pain you are carrying. I'm so sorry for your loss.", "NTA- I really don't think the kid would have felt any better if he'd seen your dog again before he died, the next time he came over would have been exactly the same, and if he reacted like that to hearing about it there is no way he could have handled being there. Imagine the scale of the meltdown once he worked out what the vet was about to do. That would have been awful for everyone including the dog. No no no.", "NTA. \n\nYou don't owe them shit, even though they seem to think they're entitled to dictate the life of someone they barely see. I'm so sorry for your loss, and I would recommend going LC with these family members until they stop thinking they get a say in your life.", "he didnt die. she killed him before her son could say goodbye to one of his best buddies. that he will never see again.", "My shepherd/ lab mix is 15.5 years. She's slowed. Still has quality of life left. Two years ago, I had this absolutely blinding panic when one day, I realized she was old. I ended up getting another dog because I was going to be a total, inconsolable wreck.\n\nShe had a bad day, and I took her to the vet. Not her normal one. They couldn't see her. The vet came out to tell me she wasn't walking and listing all these reasons it might be happening and even if they could treat her she'd be incontinent and defecating on herself and they'd recommend euthanasia. He said euthanasia like six times. Wanted to do some x-rays. I signed for x-rays and then sat in my car and called my parents and my sister because I was sobbing in my car and couldn't drive and was waiting on x-rays.\n\nI have such a good vet. He's always been very spot on. I really thought that was the end. I sobbed in my car until my family got there to drive my car home. \n\nVet came out. She had an arthritis flare up and they gave her some pain meds and she started walking again and they sent her home. I moved her to daily meds, and she's been fine since.\n\nI wanted to slap that vet. Dude, do not say the word euthanasia six times in a minute. I believed you.\n\nShe's still hanging in. Wags her tail for short walks. Sniffs around the yard. Family comes over and she wags her tail and greets them. She knows her friends.\n\nBut damn, I was just quietly crying in a parking lot. I was so terrified of losing my best friend I got myself an emotional support dog to help me. It's still going to gut me. At least I'll have my new dude.", "Man, you sound like you've had some dark experiences in your life to have that mentality towards family. I'm saying the OP is NTA because he did NOT have the attitude you're expressing.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

Came back on Saturday and was told my 15 year old cat was sick, struggling to void and they had booked her to be put down on Monday. I knew she was on a decline but it felt like this was very sudden. I spent those last get days just holding her and crying. Shit sucks, man, I feel you", "Unfortunately, that's sometimes a fact of owning a pet.  Did anyone want this outcome?  No, of course not.  No matter what, there's no great outcome to this.  20/20 hindsight is of course a thing, but I still say someone who is grieving should be shown compassion.", "Found the aunt.", "This is such a wild, entitled take. You are deeply wrong.", "The owner made the choice to not let the dog suffer in pain.  The owner made the choice to do a heartbreaking but necessary thing.  The owner was thinking of themselves and the animal not wait for someone to get back from a holiday.", "Your comment is Gross and heartless... I guarantee you that OP suffered and is grieving way more intensely than the kid... And letting a beloved pet go for their own well being is literally the ultimate act of compassion and selflessness \ud83e\udd79\ud83d\udc94 Don't throw stones, especially if you have never had to go through this...OP my heart breaks for you and I wish you peace and love, may you meet again over the rainbow bridge \u2764\ufe0f", "Na not all, my family just knows better. If you come by unannounced somebody better be dead, and even that you can tell me on the phone.", "It sucks so hard! Pets should live longer than they do. 15 or even 20 years isn't enough, it's always too damn soon.\n\n I hope you're doing better now. I'm glad you at least had those last few days and that you could be there for her at the end.", "I'm doing better for sure, thanks. Thinking about her does still get me teary eyed though lol. I adopted a new cat for my birthday in June and she is so wild and rambunctious where my Mika was my cuddly little shadow. Love my new girl but man do I miss my old girl every day.", "I get that. I lost my boy only a month ago so I'm still a crying mess when I see his photos or find an old toy of his! I have another cat too, but she has never been nearly as cuddly; he was an absolute lap cat.", "I too read it that way... maybe you need to add that the aunt also needs some strong boundaries and an assessment and diagnosis.....\n\nI didn't see it as you excusing the aunt.\n\nThere is no excusing such atrocious behaviour.  The aunt's more than the kid's.\n\nKid is 12... and sounds like a lot of ingrained enablement that makes it most difficult to change those behaviours.\n\nI get ASD.  I get the meltdowns.  I'm probably the worst parents in the world according to my autistic child... but I damn well hold my boundaries to the things that really matter.  I do, however, pick my battles with some things...\n\nIronically they are pretty good with the outside world seeing as they know the consequences if they do lose it (including the legal ones), and instead I get the frustration directed at me.  Doesn't last long but if it was to anyone else... that person would be avoiding them because they don't need that crap in their lives."]}
