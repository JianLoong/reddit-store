His job requires him to travel a fair amount, which means I am home by myself with the kids for at least one week out of each month (sometimes it\u2019s two). Next week, a friend he hasn\u2019t seen in several years who lives on the other side of the country from us will be about five hours from where we live. My husband has decided to take three days off work and drive down to see his friend. The morning after he returns from that visit with his friend, he is scheduled to leave for a week-long work trip.\n \nWhen he decided to drive down to see his friend, he suggested that the kids and I go as well. This seems like a terrible idea to me for a few reasons. First, our oldest is in school, so it would mean pulling her out for three days. Second, he and his friend have plans to play golf all day on two of the days. So I\u2019d be by myself with the kids, in a town where the only real attraction (the beach) is going to be too chilly for the kids to play. (Also, if I\u2019m being honest, I\u2019m not wild about the idea of having three kids ages 6 and under at the beach all day without any help.) Third, his friend is traveling with his girlfriend, who is in her early 20s. I can\u2019t imagine that they\u2019re going to want to spend their vacation hanging out at kid-friendly establishments. \n\nI definitively told my husband that the kids and I are not coming, and he\u2019s furious with me. I tried to make the above points to him and ask him why he thinks it\u2019s a good idea for us to come, and he just keeps repeating that it would be fun. My suspicion is that he feels guilty about taking a \u201cfor fun\u201d trip the week before he turns around and leaves on business for a week, so he\u2019s trying to flip things around and make it sound like he tried to plan a getaway for us and I refused so he\u2019s forced to go alone. \n\nMy friends have suggested that I\u2019m being too cynical and that maybe he just really wants his friend to meet our kids. He hasn\u2019t said anything like that, but to be honest even if that were his reason I\u2019m not sure that justifies packing up the kids for a 5 hour car ride and hanging out in a hotel room (or finding something to do solo with a 6, 3, and 1 year old in a beach town in November) until they get done with golf and we can eat dinner for 2 hours before the baby has to go to bed. AITA here?\n\nUPDATE: This sub is like magic. I showed him this post and the responses and it shut him down immediately. He also added \u201cI had already decided to send you to the spa for a day when I get back.\u201d I\u2019m 99% sure he had done nothing of the sort, but he will now! Thanks, team!\n\nLAST UPDATE: I obviously posted this in the hopes of being able to give my husband an \u201cI told you so,\u201d but I really am touched by some of the messages I\u2019ve received offering support and resources related to emotional abuse. As I\u2019ve said in my reply to some of those messages, I\u2019m very lucky in that this is truly out of character for my husband\u2014so out of character that I took to the internet to make sure I wasn\u2019t missing something. In reality, we have a strong and mutually supportive relationship that allows me to stay home with my kids (which is totally my choice\u2014my dream in fact. I\u2019m an attorney, so I\u2019d always have a way to support myself if things ended). If that weren\u2019t the case, though, the messages I\u2019ve been receiving would be incredibly helpful.

He thinks it will be fun, because he doesn't have to worry about the logistics and won't be the primary caregiver for the children.   \n\nIt doesn't sound fun or relaxing at all.  This isn't a family vacation if he's off with his friend every day.  Tell him he should go, with your blessing, and you can do a proper family vacation at another time", "NTA \nThis either needs to be a trip to see his friend where they can catch up, golf etc. OR it\u2019s a trip where he wants you/kids to join, and spend time with everyone all together.\n\n1. I think you need to tease out why he wants you there. Does he not want to make the drive alone. Does he want his friend to meet the kids. Does he just feel guilty leaving you for an extended period (and do you care about this?). If you think he\u2019s just feeling bad about leaving for extra time, and you truly don\u2019t mind and want him to just go enjoy himself, then make sure he knows that. \n\n2. there needs to be A LOT more compromise if he wants you to go. This is his trip with you guys added on. If he wants you there it needs to b planned that way accordingly. A round of golf takes 4ish hours, the idea that he\u2019s planning 2 full days of golf (4rounds?!) is contradicting the whole \u2018it\u2019ll be fun if you join\u2019 sentiment since 2/3 days he basically won\u2019t be with you. I think he should play 1 round with his friend if you\u2019re on the trip,  with an a early tee time he can be done by 10-11, get time with his friend and spend the rest the trip to all spend time together. Another compromise would be a shorter trip 1-2 nights. Or meeting his friends halfway for 1 night. Plenty of options if having you and the kids there is his priority. \n\n3. Even if he was planning on spending all the time together with you and kids, the 5hrdrive each way w 3 kids seems like a big ask. And all sharing a hotel room. And what if the friends want to go out at night after the kids bedtime, I\u2019d want to know what his expectation is so you don\u2019t get there and are stuck hanging back in the room while everyone else goes out. I applaud his commitment to meeting up w his friend but 5 hours is not actually close, if you\u2019re in the US it\u2019s basically the same as just flying across country to visit which he could do anytime/his friend could actually come visit and stay sometime if they want to spend a few days together. \n\n4. If you don\u2019t routinely take the kids out of school this last minute idea doesn\u2019t seem like a valid enough reasons. 3 days is a lot, it\u2019s sets a precedent that school isn\u2019t important.\n\nHonestly I wouldn\u2019t want to go. He\u2019s making no accommodation for the entire family going. Its exactly the trip he wants and just inviting you all to join secondarily.", "No one wants to visit Myrtle Beach with small kids, alone, in November. NTA.", "NTA\n\nAnd I love your update.

This all seems like an enormous amount of work for you and nothing fun at all for the kids to do. \n\nNah, this is a terrible idea.", "NTA.  That sounds awful.  Your going to drive five hours one way, have to watch your kids alone for two days, then drive five hours back?  Where is the fun for you?  I see the fun for him, but how is this a vacation?", "NTA it\u2019s probably just his guilt of constantly being away for work, so he\u2019s trying to look good in-front of his friend, but by doing that he would be putting you under even more stress. idk if he\u2019s just not thought things through or if he\u2019s an a-hole, but he has no grounds to be angry with you.", "Tell him to take the kids himself and you'll do your own thing for those 3 days.

Somewhere that requires you to either lose signal or turn in your cellphone.", "NTA. Hell no, being trapped in a hotel or burdened with toting around 3 kids alone in a different city is not a vacation. Not to mention your husband will likely pressure you to go to dinner or outings that are not very kid friendly. I only have two kids and it would be a hard no from me. A vacation is when your husband can be present and parenting with you together so you both can enjoy it as much as possible.", "Sweet deal with the spa day!! \n\nI mean, from a mom of three I know you will more than earn that \u201csweet deal,\u201d but I hope you enjoy it!!", "Consider inviting that friend and his girlfriend to your home for a visit.", "NTA  \n\n\nHe is a part time father and a part time husband, who is guilting you.", "NTA, but he sure is.", "NTA - my suspicion is your suspicion is 110% correct.", "NTA.

What a jerk.", "NTA!\n\nAs the sole income provider for my family with two children less than a year apart I would never even CONSIDER asking my partner to go on a trip with me and then plan to leave her alone with the kids. If I had to travel for work, thankfully I don't, it would be even LESS of a consideration. \n\nThe fact that he's flipping this around on you just makes my blood boil.
