{"id": 30553, "submission_id": "17qe9ku", "title": "AITA for refusing my husband\u2019s \u201cfamily vacation\u201d?", "selftext": "My husband (38M) and I (38F) have three kids (6, 3, and 1).  His job requires him to travel a fair amount, which means I am home by myself with the kids for at least one week out of each month (sometimes it\u2019s two). Next week, a friend he hasn\u2019t seen in several years who lives on the other side of the country from us will be about five hours from where we live. My husband has decided to take three days off work and drive down to see his friend. The morning after he returns from that visit with his friend, he is scheduled to leave for a week-long work trip.\n \nWhen he decided to drive down to see his friend, he suggested that the kids and I go as well. This seems like a terrible idea to me for a few reasons. First, our oldest is in school, so it would mean pulling her out for three days. Second, he and his friend have plans to play golf all day on two of the days. So I\u2019d be by myself with the kids, in a town where the only real attraction (the beach) is going to be too chilly for the kids to play. (Also, if I\u2019m being honest, I\u2019m not wild about the idea of having three kids ages 6 and under at the beach all day without any help.) Third, his friend is traveling with his girlfriend, who is in her early 20s. I can\u2019t imagine that they\u2019re going to want to spend their vacation hanging out at kid-friendly establishments. \n\nI definitively told my husband that the kids and I are not coming, and he\u2019s furious with me. I tried to make the above points to him and ask him why he thinks it\u2019s a good idea for us to come, and he just keeps repeating that it would be fun. My suspicion is that he feels guilty about taking a \u201cfor fun\u201d trip the week before he turns around and leaves on business for a week, so he\u2019s trying to flip things around and make it sound like he tried to plan a getaway for us and I refused so he\u2019s forced to go alone. \n\nMy friends have suggested that I\u2019m being too cynical and that maybe he just really wants his friend to meet our kids. He hasn\u2019t said anything like that, but to be honest even if that were his reason I\u2019m not sure that justifies packing up the kids for a 5 hour car ride and hanging out in a hotel room (or finding something to do solo with a 6, 3, and 1 year old in a beach town in November) until they get done with golf and we can eat dinner for 2 hours before the baby has to go to bed.

I think you are correct in suspecting that your husband feels guilty and is trying to package this as a family vacation to assuage his guilt.\n2. Ask your husband to tell you exactly what fun he plans to have with you and the kids (and to specify what hours) and how that will work with the kids' needs to eat/sleep at times that are reasonable for them. That would force him to acknowledge that either he would have to give up on some of the fun he wants to have with his friend or he would actually be dumping childcare on you in a non-kid-friendly setting, for no real benefit to you or the kids.\n3. If he balks at that, then tell him that he is welcome to take the three kids with HIM to visit his friend. That way the kids don't have to miss out on all the fun he says he wants to have with them. But you will not be coming.\n4. Tell him that his only other choice is to be very appreciative that his wife understands how rare it is for him to see his friend and is willing to stay home with the kids so that he can see his friend. And that if he wants to make it up to you, he should plan to give you a really nice something - a spa day, a weekend away for yourself, etc.", "NTA, he needs to take the kids with him (yes, all 3 he lovingly created) and allow you some free time alone at home whike he catches up with his friend before \u201cwork\u201d starts.", "NTA. \n\nAnd no, it would not be fun. Three small kids, solo mom, boring town in late Fall sounds miserable. You are right to say no. \n\nNow, when is your alone time? Or time to travel or see friends?", "NTA, not a fun trip for you and your kids, potentially dangerous for one adult and 3 small kids by the beach; he\u2019s gaslighting you by making you feel bad by turning down an desirable invitation", "It sounds like your analysis is spot on. NTA", "NTA- Pack the younger kids and tell hubby enjoy the 3 days with the two kids.", "NTA thats not a family vacation. That\u2019s a second thought thing.

When he's back go on your own trip minus kids at the very  least for an overnight. Early check in  late check out you are gone almost 2 days.   Stock food, don't want to make it impossible for him.    Let him see what you do all week every time he's away.", "NTA\n\nBut IF you go, i would leave the hotel at the 2nd day very early (alone) and leave him a note \"i watched the kids yesterday, today is MY fun day, you will have the kids\" and not picking up the phone the whole day.

So he shouldn't have a problem spending a day with his kids when you did the same the day before. ;)\n\nBut this will not make the tension between you and husband better. So staying home and telling him \"you feeling guilty about leaving me alone with the kids when you will be gone for work the week after is a you problem. Handle the guilt or stay home. But if i'm gonna stay and watch the kids anyway all day while you go and have fun with your friend on the golf course all day long, i see myself justified wanting to watch the kids here, at home where we have everything we need instead of dragging them to another city where it will be more stress for me and the kids.\"", "NTA This is absolutely not fun for you or your kids and therefore not for husband. I would ask him what exactly would be the fun of this 5 hour drive and three day trip with 3 very young children. I for sure can\u2019t think of 1 thing.", "NTA. tell him you do not plan on watching the kids during daytime hours, that you will spend your days doing vacation things for yourself, like spas/gyms/salons/museums/libraries/etc.\nWhen he complains about that being too hard on him, ask why he's so content for the burden to be placed on you so he can spend the entire day doing his \"guy things.\"", "NTA. Yes he probably feels guilty but I have have a hunch he also wants to pawn off the friend's girlfriend on you. They sound like they wanna do a boys' getaway and have no use for her either. I mean two days golfing... that definitely does not include her, and if it's just the 3 of them they won't be able to shake her off.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
