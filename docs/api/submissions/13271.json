Learn some respect then old ladies wont come yelling at you for your behaviors.\n\nYes she is also TA for coming out screaming but she is allowed to not want people swearing around her kids. And based of your attitude you probably swear and act \"edgy\" alot. And wr aslo dont know how many times she has asked you to stop swearing in from of her kids.", "NTA. I would walk by her house every day dropping f bombs.", "Nta.  I'm not sure you acted rudely at all.  And I can swear with the best of them.  Though I try to curtail it around kids.  But more importantly how would u know where her kids are?  Either way, no.  Ur nta", "Nta", "NTA. Because in my industry, everyone swear", "I'm not a fan of how you handled that woman. I'd just say \"OK, I'm sorry I sweared but you are  overreacting here and you can't make any decisions on where I go or not. So if you keep your attitude at bay I will do my best to keep my swearing at bay\".  \n\n\nBut this is semi-binary here. You are or aren't the AH. And then it's plain as day here:  \nNTA.", "ESH - you were asked not to swear around children . It's not big or clever to be foul mouthed , and you sound very immature . Yes , people swear but if you cannot do so in a way that is appropriate , then don't do so. It's perfectly reasonable for a parent not to want you swearing around her children . Your edit makes you sound even more childish . \n\nHowever she should not have escalated to shouting , but again , calling people crazy lady for not wanting their children exposed to your language choices is immature . She has handled this badly , but the fact remains that having the freedom to go wherever you want comes with the responsibility of behaving appropriately . I would be very embarrassed if someone came to us and said that our teenagers could not be trusted to not swear around children", "If the kids go to school they've probably heard worse than one swear word spoken.", "Agreed. ESH", "just say ur a hardcore puritan and go bro", "so adults are supposed to scan the entire area around them before they can speak their mind? stop being such a FUCKING puritan", "This is among the most idiotic comments I've ever seen.\n\n> You were given a valid trespass order by a person in authority, going back there is literally a crime.\n\nA) Some random bint living across the street isn't \u201ca person in authority\u201d over anything or anyone. B) Being in public street street across from someone's home isn't \u201ctrespass\u201d.\n\nAll the rest of your comment is about equally as bad, this was just the most easily refuted snippet. Delete your account.", "This is so backwards. She was in a public space, this woman has no authority. No one is required to \"obey legal directions\" from strangers...is this a joke? \n\n \"Respect your elders\" is something I have taught my children to be wary of. Trusted adults is one thing, a stranger that screams at my child in public? Fuck no. \n\nNow, OP was an asshole in how they responded, but not because of any *obligations* to the general adults in public.", "Tell us the stories!!", "I mean, you are an asshole.", "If that kind of hostility from strangers is triggering for you (understandable if you have long-standing trauma around anger and hostility!) then perhaps it\u2019s worth speaking to your parents about finding a therapist to help you work through your trauma? Triggers are absolutely understandable and normal, but often they\u2019re something that you can consciously work on; you don\u2019t have to just accept them as part of who are you.", "I got the same vibe.", "Ask me how I know you don't have kids.", "So we eliminated her lawn.

Where are you from?", "No age mentioned, juvenile/casual writing style, lady complained to his parents. Textbook reddit teenager.", "What about 'I ain't got no more fucks to give' I don't know how to link but it's on YouTube.  Play it, you know, for the family,  but I'm petty.  Lol.", "As children we used to take the seeds and tried to drop them into each others collars as a prank because they were said to make you itch very much. I personally never experienced more itching than with hay or something.", "That speaks to OP's age; not my question.", "You've got your head up your onus, if that's what you got from their comment.", "so the crazy neighbors mad at you when HER KIDS are the one antagonizing you all the time. christ.", "dont listen to the puritan assholes that seemed to have found ur post. any sane person would see immediately that ur not the asshole. you are in public, you can speak how you want (within reason like dont start calling minorites slurs but i think its clear u arent doing that???). you can say cusses, even if it was 10 cusses stringed together in front of kids youd still be in the right lmao. the kids are gonna learn cuss words some day and its not ur job to be their fucking parent.", "CeeLo Green has a great song too \ud83d\ude06", "What concept? What example? And why is it \"bad\"?", "What? If your question wasn't about what the textual evidence was for OP's young age then I have no idea what you were trying to say", "Honestly I think you are a lost cause so I'll decline to answer.

They are only using their age and use of a word as a basis for their judgement of \"thinks they are edgy\", which I don't find to be very truth-seeking and leans heavily upon stereotype. \n\nSo what is it *really* based on? Seems like an empty, nefarious judgement with no backing, ageist at best. *That's* what I was attempting at getting at in my comment (*but I was asking as I may always be wrong!*)", "I don't feel very sad. \n\nBut no, it doesn't make sense to me.", "*?* Is a non-parent not allowed to even *ask* about child endangerment?", "I am genuinely glad you don't feel sad \ud83d\ude4f", "Are you genuinely asking?", "Considering you just told me to \"stay in my sad world\" and I'm a \"lost cause\" I'm getting conflicting input lol."]}
