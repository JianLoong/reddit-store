He has 5 kids with 5 different women. Nothing more needs to be said about that as he is not the topic here.\n\nI am mom to child 2. After my ex had separated from mom 3 and mom 4, I friended both of them on Facebook as they were caring for my child's siblings. ( He is currently dating mom 5). And I wanted to ensure I was still in contact so when I get the chance to be in their neighborhood, I can have my child visit his siblings. They are about 2 hours away from where we are so it isn't an easy trip.\n\nMom 4 has reached out multiple times regarding money. I am doing well for myself and she is struggling. She ran into an issue of being homeless and certain people around her had gotten CPS involved. She's been trying to get her kids (yes plural as she had 2 more after the first) back from CPS. She's been struggling a lot and I had helped her out by giving money whenever she asked. It was always said to be for diapers, formula, food, presents for their birthdays, gas to make it to work, court, or to visit the kids. All sorts of things. Couldn't prove it if she actually used the money for what she said and I didn't ask.\n\nI couldn't really tell you how much I had given but I have receipts and can check. It isn't important though. She had always said she would pay me back but I didn't hold my breath in that. And I don't ask her to either. \n\nWell I just found out today, not from her either, that she had officially lost custody of her children. They have been adopted to a loving home and she will no longer have them or see them. I feel kind of bad for wanting to decide to basically cut her off. I'm ready to block her entirely and move on with my life. The only reason I even was in contact was for the child that was directly related to mine. Since that is now not a thing, I don't need her to be around anymore. \n\nWIBTA if I just stop all contact and decide not to give her more money?\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention, in case it was relevant, I have been helping her out for the past 5 years.

If the only reason you were friends were because of the children and you didn't really bond further than that, it's totally fine to step away.

Just don\u2019t engage in an argument about it. If she asks why, just say that you are done loaning money to people full stop. If she argues just repeat yourself and block.", "You are NTA, you are a saint. You did your best to help children that you have no relation to. Said children are now adopted into a loving home and are being taken care of. You did what you could for them. It is time to\nmove on and you should not feel bad.", "NTA. In fact, you need to stop. It is likely helping to enable unhealthy aspects in her life.", "NTA, and I don't think you owe her any explanation.  If you were consistently giving her the same amount of money at the same time every month, then I would give her a heads up that she needs to replace that income.", "NTA\n\nParents have their rights completely severed and their children out up for adoption if their actions have beed extremely egregious and they've made little or no effort to change.  It's entirely likely that this woman is an addict and she's been using your money to buy drugs.", "NTA.\n\nCPS doesn't remove children from a home and adopt them out just because the family is poor.

And she sounds like she has already seriously abused your generosity.", "NTA. You've played. Stop giving her money.", "NTA. To me, you were supporting those kids. She just happened to be the one receiving the monetary aid. Whether or not that aid trickled down to the kids is up to her. Now that those kids are getting better care, I don't think you need to continue giving her money.", "NTA for not giving money.  I don't think you have spoken about the concern of disrupting the sibling bond between your child and hers.  How old is your child's half-sibling?  Is this a formal, final adoption, with both parents' parental rights terminated?  Do you/your child want to continue that relationship?  You are a kind and compassionate person, and I know you will have considered these things with your child's and the other child's best interests in mind.  Good luck to you.", "NTA.  There is more than a good chance that the money you gave wasn't used for what she said it would be (for the kids).  There is probably more to the story about why CPS took her kids away from her.\n\nYou were beyond kind to help her for 5 years.  At this point, it's reasonable that your done.", "NTA - OP, I commend you so much for keeping in touch with the mother\u2019s of your child\u2019s siblings. It\u2019s so special that you\u2019ve done that for them and put them first! That being said, this other mom is using you for money at this point, and you have no obligation towards her. I would suggest maybe trying to get into contact with the family that adopted your child\u2019s half-sibling so they could still have a relationship?", "Her bad decision making is not your concern.  Cut her off.  She was using you.  You can't save the world.  But, if you are feeling all that generous......I will take donations to my lunch fund.  \n\nNTA", "Just drop her cold after she lost her kids? I can understand not providing financial support anymore, but unless she's a really toxic person I think YWBTA for dropping her at a real low point in her life. \n\nIf she is just clinging on in the hope of more money, just say no - everyone is hurting for money right now - and she'll drop you if that's all she's about.", "I know I don't have the whole story and I probably never will. And you are right, I was helping for the kids. Not her.", "I think that is why she would ask consistently for help with money. She didn't have anyone else willing to give anything. Which is why I do feel bad if I stop but with the child gone, I no longer have an interest to know her or speak to her.", "I know but given I had been doing this for about 5 years at this point, I just feel bad for not wanting to continue anymore.", "So honestly, we really didn't have any bond. I only reached out to her initially for contact after I found out that her and my ex had separated. Even then, I made it clear that I wanted my child to know her child as they were related. I've wanted to step away for a while but felt bad and worried that if I did, she would no longer allow us to see her child. We were never really friends to begin with and given how much she's still struggling financially mostly, I don't want to be her friend because I would feel like I am just an ATM to her. But I feel bad knowing that she is struggling and that I can help, I just don't want to anymore.", "When she would claim this, it was supposed to be for when she had visits with them. So I had no reason to suspect anything else at the time. But you're probably right. I've been around a lot of people with kids in the system and they have claimed to be doing everything right and exactly what was asked of them but the system is out to get them and they still took their kids away. I haven't spoken to her yet about what happened but I will be mentioning it soon. Just not yet as it is right before Christmas.", "It wasn't that. She would ask for help at different times. It wasn't regular. Sometimes 1 time in a month and others, twice a week. Usually $20 here and there but then it started getting to more and more and she most recently asked me to help with her rent. That was my tipping point because it is starting to get a little much. But the reason for needing the money was mostly the same. She needs to get diapers, food, and the biggest one was gas money to go to her court date and to visit the kids.", "It is possible but I honestly couldn't say for sure. I do know whenever I was talking to her, she seemed to always have trouble with her living situation. Even before the kids were taken and I believe that may have been a huge contributor to that.", "My child is 12 and hers is 5 currently. We haven't been able to see them for about 2 years now since CPS got involved as it was in the middle of the pandemic and only specific people could be around the children. Yes both parental rights are being terminated. Dad signed his rights away during the beginning of this for his own reasons and so it was just left to mom to complete what she needed to do to get the kids back. That isn't happening anymore abs so adoption is the last step. \n\nI would love to keep in contact with the adoptive parents but I can't get that information currently. Mom isn't telling me, but says she's trying, and I'm not privy to the info directly from CPS or the courts.\n\nI've talked with my child about it and he understands what is going on. While he is upset about it, he knows I'm trying to get the info I can but am limited. I'm not keeping secrets from him about this. But given that we haven't seen the other child since they were 3, I doubt they even know what is going on with our world.", "That's what I'm worried about. The main reason I even wanted to keep in contact was because of the child. But now the child definitely won't be there anymore and I don't and probably will never know the child anymore. But she's been hurting for money since we have been in contact. Before the kids were taken, she was struggling. So it isn't like she just recently fell on hard times. We're going on 5 years now and 3 kids later (2 with her current partner). That's why I felt I might be TA because of the current situation and how everything played out.", "And that\u2019s totally understandable, but let me ask you, would you have given her money in the first place if you knew it would end up like this?", "Many of the people I've dealt with claimed to be doing everything, but usually were not.\n\nIt takes a great deal for parental rights to be severed and foster children to be adopted.\n\nThe main thing to remember is that you tried to help your child's sibling. That was kind. Now the child is not in her custody and there is no reason for you to continue to give the mother money.", "This breaks my heart.  You are doing the best that anyone can.", "If the kids and the money really are all you had in common, she'll drop you fast enough, but if she actually has come to think of you as a friend, she might be really hurt. Or she might be a toxic and dangerous person you are very grateful to be free of.", "Depends if I knew her whole story. I was helping her out before the kids were taken. They had only been in foster care for the last 2 years at this point and I had been helping for the last 5. Even if I knew the kids wouldn't be around anymore, I would want to help to maybe try to change the outcome. \n\nIf I knew the reason the kids were taken was something more sinister, then hell no! I would do everything I can to get those kids away from her. But I couldn't honestly tell you why they were adopted out. All I've been told was she was trying to get them back. I think it had a lot to do with living situations because most of this time we talked, she didn't have anywhere to be and was couch hoping.", "Ahh ok that makes sense. I absolutely sympathize with that, but when it comes down to it, your support, whether financial or emotional, is yours to give and yours to take. It\u2019s a terrible situation, but you are under no obligation to continue supporting her", "NTA, you have been doing an amazing thing for her and your child's siblings.  If you still want to help her in other ways you could look into resources she may need and direct her to those.", "NTA and much respect for not being a bitter woman towards others. You did your part and you were helping the kids. Unfortunately they're no longer an issue for her to pay for so she can take care of it from here.", "NTA, you have been more than generous to help her out as long as you have. You are not obligated to keep helping someone who is showing no signs of trying to help themselves. 5 years is more than enough time for her to get her shit together. If anything I'd say you should have cut her off long ago. She is taking advantage of you.", "NTA. This is obviously a terrible situation, but she no longer has children to care for or it seems legal fees relevant to the children, and it's entirely possible and even likely the money you were giving never actually went to the kids at all (at least, not most of it.) You've been more than generous for FIVE whole YEARS- that's more than I would do for a woman I was only very tenuously connected with, especially while caring for my own children. It's past time for you to stop providing for someone who clearly couldn't and probably wouldn't provide for her own children.", "NTA! And I will say your hound dog ex really screwed up. You are a noble human being that cares about others. Your kiddo is in great hands. Happy Holidays and good luck!", "I feel like you were helping the kids more than her.  The kids are in a safe space now and she's reaping what she sowed.  NTA.  Stop supporting her.", "NTA. You're a good person with a good heart OP. Don't beat yourself up over one person. Your goodness will get you far in life. I hope your \"friend\" can get her life straightened out for her own sake. You don't owe her anymore of your time or money.", "NTA you were generous and kind. There is no reason to continue the relationship.", "NTA, you should block and remove her from your life, because it seems like her only contribution for a while has been to hit you with sob stories and get money out of you, without in any way verifying that she actually was using that money for what she said, probably because she wasn't.\n\nThere really is no purpose in maintaining contact with her", "You definitely should not give her more. It would be enabling at this point.", "I think you can do a slow fade and not feel bad about it at all. \n\nI suspect this woman's lifestyle is very different from your own (CPS doesn't permanently sever the parental bond without good reason), and she's not someone you'd ordinarily choose to know.", "I think you already went too far giving to her so freely. Definitely block her number and move on", "If you continue at this point, she will never figure out how to be self sufficient", "At a certain point, you create dependency rather than helping. She needs to face the reality that as an adult she needs to learn to support herself and live within her means. Whether her issue is addiction, gambling, or something else she needs to work through her problems and learn self sufficiency unless you intend to pay for her until she dies. Now is the best time to do that so she can reap the benefit one day", "I would not ask for for an explanation for what happened \u2014 I doubt that she has been honest with you but that\u2019s water under the bridge now. Just say \u201cI\u2019m sorry for that, I wish you the best in life\u201d and absolutely do not involve yourself with her further. Any further \u201chelp\u201d only creates further dependency", "Indeed, it seems like she finally found someone get money out of and got comfortable using that. I think you need to look at the situation and see that given that things have only gotten worse, she wasn't some way the problem. You need to cut her off or she'll keep being your problem", "It is something more sinister for sure. People don\u2019t get their parental rights terminated due to poverty.  If that was the only issue. Social services would have provided the family with housing and services to get them back on their feet.\n\nNTA\n\nYou were providing help for your child\u2019s sibling. This is now just a single adult with only herself to support. She can figure it out.\n\nHave you been in contact with social services? They can pass your info along to the parents and the siblings can possibly be able to have a relationship someday.", "You have been helping someone who presumably hasn't had much custody of her kids in that time. You don't owe her anything and the reason for the contact has gone. You're being used. NTA to end it.", "NTA you're allowing her to make her own problems yours.  She's using her kids to make you feel guilty.  Just walk away.", "Yea they would have been placed in foster care if she was homeless, she either signed her rights away willingly or committed a crime that forced her to."]}
