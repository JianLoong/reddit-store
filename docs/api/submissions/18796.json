It is a one bedroom, with my landlord and his wife living above me. I pay a cheap rent and half the utilities for the house. Landlord is a friend from high school that we hang out with socially quite often.\n\nMy girlfriend got a new job within ten minutes of my apartment and her house is about an hour away. It wasn\u2019t intentional (the job kind of landed in her lap and is good money), so it makes more sense for her to stay with me more frequently when she is working in office. It has been this way for about 6 months that my girlfriend is at my apartment about 4-5 nights a week. There is street parking, so my girlfriend doesn\u2019t occupy the driveway and my entrance is separate with a locked door between the units. \n\nThis week I am working midnights. Girlfriend has a key and has been staying at my place while I\u2019m at work in the evening since Wednesday. Yesterday (Thursday evening) I get call from landlord flipping that she has been there, saying he doesn\u2019t like other people in his space. I say it\u2019s my space she is in as she doesn\u2019t leave my unit (and is locked from entering his) and he says he is not comfortable with someone there without me. My girlfriend and I went to their all inclusive wedding, she is not a stranger to him and I said as much. It turned into argument that couldn\u2019t be solved while I was at work, so I told him my girlfriend would go home for the evening and him and I would sort it out in the morning. \n\nMy girlfriend was upset, but packed to leave. While packing, my girlfriend called me in tears because my friend could be heard upstairs screaming about her being there and presumably smashing stuff. I could hear him through the phone, so I told my girlfriend to leave her stuff and I would bring it. \n\nWhen I arrived home that morning from my overnight work shift, I let my landlord know I would be moving out. He was very upset and said I\u2019m TA for leaving him hanging for my rent next month when all he is asking is to have my girlfriend over less. I told him he\u2019s now made it so my girlfriend is uncomfortable at my place at all and that I want to live somewhere, where I can have guests at my own discretion, especially when I am paying half the utilities. He said it\u2019s not about money, but about \u201ccomfortability\u201d and he\u2019d be happy to talk to my girlfriend to make sure she knows they are still friends. I just want to be done with it, he made it clear what he is comfortable with and I made it clear what I am. AITA for wanting to move out so I can continue to have my girlfriend over all the time?\n\nETA - to clarify a common question, we had no formal signed lease and were just on a month to month basis. Where I live, legally I can have guests stay up to fortnight (14 days) before it is considered additional occupancy, though I know she stays more than what most call a guest.", "created_utc": 1685725281, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13yi8xf/aita_for_having_my_girlfriend_over_all_the_time/", "score": 485, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

There are red flags here. The fact that he was screaming and smashing things while she was there alone points to more potentially distressing or dangerous situations ahead. You are making the right move in leaving. \n\nIn the future, though, it\u2019s important to discuss changes to your tenancy, such as having a person begin living with you part-time or full-time, if this was not agreed upon at the outset. It will help you maintain better working relationships with your landlords, whether or not they are friends. (Not having explicitly discussed the situation with him and come to a mutual agreement still does *not* justify his violent overreaction, however.)", "ESH\n\nYour landlord's reaction was way over the top and out of control.  I don't blame you for moving out.  But a \"guest\" is someone you invite over to your place when you are around.  Someone with a key who can come and go when they please and use the place as their own regardless of whether or not you are there is much more like an additional *tenant* than a guest.  Many landlords would have issues with you making a copy of the key and allowing your gf to essentially use the place as her own for most nights of the week, especially if utilities for one tenant are included in the lease (and now you're using double) or if they live on the premises and are now sharing space with a tenant they didn't agree to.", "You're not moving out \"to see your girlfriend\".\n\nYou're moving out in order to escape an ahole. Do it for yourself.", "NTA. I had a \"landlord\" like this who got mad when my daughter had friends over for a few days and would slam stuff around when he was mad. It turned into an awful and uncomfortable situation for all of us until I left. You have the right to have whomever you want in your space. Especially with the outburst of slamming things around aggressively, you're better off somewhere else.", "ESH - if she's been living there for 5 days a week for 6 months - she's living there, not a visitor. You should have cleared this with your landlord, he should have behaved more professionally as  a landlord when he found out.", "NTA- um, wow.  I'd move this is not a healthy thing going on with him. If he was stomping and throwing things like that. eep so very wrong.\n\nYou PAY for a seperate space, a space where she can not enter his space so this has NO actual impact on his day to day life. He also had to be watching your place to see who was entering it.", "\"It's not about money but you're hanging me for next months rent man!\" As long as you don't have a signed lease with this guy then get out and get a place both you and your gf can enjoy without rules like that.", "What does your lease agreement say? It is common for leases to require only the named tenant to be living in the space. Your girlfriend staying 5 times per week and having a key to stay there when you aren't there basically means she is an occupant of the apartment.", "Everyone is an asshole. \n\nThere\u2019s a difference between renting to one person vs two. Especially in a small unit that\u2019s attached to a home. It\u2019s not \u201cI can do anything I want because I rented here.\u201d So, yeah, you\u2019re an asshole for having double occupancy on a single apartment. Twice as bad due to the close living situation. \n\nOTH, it should be in the lease what the limitations are. And, he shouldn\u2019t be making your GF uncomfortable. That\u2019s just NOT okay and definitely asshole ish. \n\nI don\u2019t see a problem with leaving. It\u2019s not working out for either of you. So, not the asshole in regards to moving out. He\u2019s an asshole for trying to guilt trip you over it.", "NTA\n\nHe acted like a deranged fool. Get out of there for your safety, and for your GF's safety!\n\nThat is completely unhinged behavior. He is no longer a friend.\n\nTell him it's about comfortability too, and you don't feel comfortable renting from such a huge asshole.\n\nA landlord does not get to dictate who you have in your space, or when you have them. They are NOT a roommate sharing the space with you.", "NTA.\n\nWhile you should have given a heads up to your landlord, even if it was just to notify him that the utilities bill might go up bc your girlfriend was staying a few nights a week, he lost the advantage when he\n\n* started saying he didn't like people in his space (dude, the units are physically separated)\n* started screaming about your GF being there and smashing stuff ( she was already leaving, that fecal matter show was unnecessary and close to a tantrum) \n* lied through his teeth when he said \"all he was asking was to have your GF over less\" ( he literally said he didn't want her there while considering your unit as his space too)\n\nAt this point, I doubt anything he will do will make your GF feel comfortable in close proximity of him. And nothing guarantees he won't lose his marbles again, with your GF or any other guest you decide to bring home.\n\nThat apartment is no longer a safe space.", "NTA, but it does seem like she is more than a guest. Maybe that is what he is mad about?  A guest is typically someone that comes over when you are home not someone that has a key and comes and goes as they please.  Either way he was way too angry about it and I don't blame you for wanting to leave. Who knows what the next thing will be to make him flip and smash things...", "NTA. \n\nProceed with moving out and putting this unhinged person behind you. \n\nThis wasn\u2019t even about how often your GF stays over; that\u2019s a whole separate issue which could have been resolved peacefully. But for him to *scream and break things and rage on her so bad he\u2019s heard through the phone* ? That\u2019s psychotic behaviour.\n\nI would feel very unsafe staying near someone like that. Who knows what the next trigger will be ?", "NTA sounds like a toxic living situation and I\u2019d absolutely leave as well. The rent is his problem, he shouldn\u2019t have thrown a fit if he was so worried about you staying to pay half the bills", "NTA", "ESH. She's not a guest, not really. She's living with you the majority of the time. He shouldn't have reacted in such an extreme way but landlords aren't going to be okay with an extra person living there who isn't on the lease. You may pay rent but it's not fully your place; it's his house and you have to abide by the terms of the lease.", "ESH. You let your girlfriend move in without getting the OK from your landlord. He should've talked to you about it sooner and in a more professional way, but I can see why he'd be frustrated. He only had an agreement with you to live there (though informal), and he only collects rent for you. \n\nGenerally, if a person stays for more than 14 days a month, then they're no longer a guest, they're living with you. Plus your gf keeps a bunch of her stuff at your house. And she spends 5/7 days a week with you, so she's definitely at your house more than she's at her own house. She lives with you. \n\nIf you had been living in an apartment complex, or had a less easy-going landlord, adding another person without getting the ok can get you evicted. So you're lucky that all you got is yelled at. \n\nIf I were your friend, I wouldn't be too miffed to see you go, and I'd definitely make any future tenants sign a formal lease. For you, make sure that you ask any future landlords to add another tenant before you do it.", "YTA. You pay \"cheap rent\" and two people are living there when it sounds like there is probably one person on the lease. Yes, your girlfriend is essentially living there, not just visiting.  Move out and get a place for two with new landlords understanding that there are two people that will be occupying the apartment. Landlord is crazy but you moved a second person in without telling the family that owns the property, the landlord. Most landlords want to know if there are pets and how many people occupy the premises.  If you were to get a pet, you should notify landlord before bringing a new pet home too.", "NTA\nLease is month to month. You have no obligation to stay.", "ESH\n\nIt's a bit of a weird situation because you have no formal lease so it's more like you are roommates with just an understanding of paying rent/utilities. Usually a formal tenant/landlord relationship will outline exactly what is and isn't allowed. In this case, nothing on your end I would consider something crazy, but you probably should have asked your friend before giving the key to someone else. Many landlords won't allow you to make copies of the key or give them out because then they don't know how many people have access to their property. This also goes when you're staying with a friend like you are. So I totally understand that he's not comfortable with that. When he let you know that, you should have understood and said you'll take the key back. You definitely shouldn't have told your gf to go back there with the key your friend doesn't want her to have and alone to pack up. He just said he doesn't want her there alone!\n\nThat beings aid, your friend losing his mind and screaming/smashing things is crazy. Had he not lost it like that, I would have said Y T A.\n\nYou're definitely N T A for moving out, though. You have no formal contract so you can pretty much up and leave at any time. No problems there. But at your new place, remember to pay attention to who you are allowed to give a key to. It seems your gf and you are now more living together rather than her being a guest if she is there 4-5 days a week and has her own key. Any landlord would see it like that and won't be happy if the agreement is for you to live there alone.", "ESH. I think your landlord overreacted. But a guest isn't someone who has a key and is in and out of your apartment when you're not home and who stays four or five nights a week. That's a co-tenant, and it also is really pushing the 14-day stay rule.", "NTA.  He's your landlord not your parent.  He may not even be a friend any more.  I don't know about you but I would be moving out ASAP as he has created a hostile environment with his ragefest and I don't think an apology will cut it for your girlfriend.  Nobody gets to treat someone else that way.", "NTA. \n\nUnless the lease specifies otherwise, your landlord doesn't get to tell you who can stay over, when, or for how long.  And while that is a legal answer, it is also a moral one. You rent your own space, so it is fully up to you who you have over and when. I live alone, it impacts none of my neighbors for my partner to stay over, and they get no say in what I di in my apartment. \n\nPlus, his reaction is very troublesome. There's no reason to be yelling and screaming, and for that alone you should be leaving. He can't act like that and then be like \"we are cool, we are friends!\" You are right to get out of there, because something is wrong with this dude.", "> saying he doesn\u2019t like other people in his space.\n\nNTA.  This is your home and it's not his business.  Doesn't/shouldn't matter who owns it.  This isn't smoking in a non-smoking flat or having pets when pets aren't allowed.  This is your GF, staying there AND their friend.  This is a play for control.  \"You rent from me, this isn't your space, I am the master here etc...\"\n\nWhat does he think is going to happen?  That she's going to start taking a hammer to the place or smear shit up the walls?", "NTA\n\nYou had a self-contained apartment. That's your space. Your landlord doesn't need to be thinking about when you have guests, as long as there's no disruption.", "I live in a country where everything below 6 weeks without at least 24 hours in between needs no separate contract. I usually have at least 3 keys. My brother even has 5.\nMy friend has one, in case I forget mine or look myself out. And one set I keep for visitors who stay overnight...\n\nSo I have 2 questions:\nDid you have to copy the key?\nWhy do you pay HALF the utilities if your landlord and his partner are two and so are using more (or is he alone and he was screaming at the walls)?", "NTA\n\nYou're month-to-month, you're free to leave.

She's an unapproved resident. She spends, at minimum, half the month at your house! Also, if it took long enough to pack her essentials that she was disturbed by the landlord throwing a fit upstairs, she's mostly moved in, too. \n\nBeyond how long she's essentially lived there, she really shouldn't be there alone when you aren't there if she's not a resident.

If he had a real hobby or life he honestly wouldn't even notice.", "NTA. \n\nThis is insane. You have a separate apartment and pay 50% or the household utilities.

Just because you don't have a lease, don't mean your landlord was okay with two of you when they signed up for one of you. Your landlord's reaction was over the top. My first roommate had her boyfriend over every single day, including when she wasn't here. She never paid anything extra in rent and utilities and just expected me to be okay with it. I signed up for one person, not two. Sorry, but you were wrong here too. I understand you want your girlfriend over, but unless it's your own place that you have a lease for and have your own rules for, you respect the rules of others. You said you have have guests over a fortnight, which if I am correct, is 14 days, and you said yourself she stays 4-5 days a week, which is 16-20 days a month, out of 30 days. That's nearly the entire month. If your landlord wasn't acting like an ass too, I'd say YTA entirely. Jesus, just move in with your girlfriend already and cut out the middleman.", "NTA like at all. His behavior is totally over the top and not conducive towards a comfortable living situation. You are well within your rights to have her there regularly and make a key for her. You're entirely correct that it's your space not his because you are paying to live there. The yelling and smashing things was so over the top. Unless she was upping the utilities dramatically, going into his space, being loud and disturbing him and his wife or trashing the place I see no reason why it's even any of his business.", "NTA. Your landlords behavior just sounds strange.", "You may not like my answer but in my opinion YTA. Your landlord was over the top, yes, but it\u2019s annoying having to share a unit with someone who\u2019s over so frequently, yet contributes nothing to the household. You\u2019re having her over 4-5 times weekly, what if she\u2019s loud? She shouldn\u2019t be in your apartment when you\u2019re not there, especially cause you\u2019re living with someone.
