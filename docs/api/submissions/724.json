I was travelling back to my college from my hometown after my vacation. Since my college is almost 125 miles away from the nearest airport, we generally have to take cabs. Most of the time we use our college unofficial cab share groups to find people travelling at the same time to save money.\n\nSo this time I was travelling with two freshmen, a boy and a girl. I had just met and since they were junior to me i tried being nice to them.The girl was having trouble carrying her luggage from the airport to the pickup point. So i offered to help in carrying it. She reluctantly agreed. It felt weird and she gave me the look as if i creeped her out because of that.\n\nI thought I was doing a nice thing but i just felt sad since the incident. I didn't have anywhere else to go or anywhere to talk about it. It might  have been something about my looks because i have some teeth alignment issues but i am not sure. This shit has been keeping me up for a few days now\n\nI am sorry if I violated any community guidelines.

She could have just said no.", "nta. you were kind.  that girl has issues.  no reason to look at you like that", "NTA - she might have been nervous not knowing you. She might have been tired. Dont take it personally.", "It sounds like she was just wary of you bc, as a women there is always that chance that someone who seems to be doing a nice thing is actually going to kidnap you, etc.  It's a safety concern we all live with.

She could have said no.  Since she gave you the look I would have left her to take care of it herself.  She can pay the concierge to carry her bags.\n\nBTW.  You take a taxi 125 miles?  Isn't that expensive as hell?", "NTA\n\nThe only question I would have is - how insistent you were with your offer, given you said she reluctantly agreed. In the end I definitely don't think you're in the wrong because you had good intentions, just curious given women can be wary of unfamiliar men and I'm not sure exactly how the interaction went between you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

After reading the responses here i also think that she was a bit wary as we had only met around 4-5 hours before", "That's probably it. You might also be reading into the look a bit too much as well. In the end, as I said, you didn't do anything wrong, just gave a helpful offer."]}
