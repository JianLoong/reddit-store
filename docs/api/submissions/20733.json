Little back story my mom went missing a few years ago. Cops believe it was a drug deal gone wrong. She disappeared out of thin air basically. My mom and I didn\u2019t have the best relationship but she was still my mother. My fianc\u00e9\u2019s parents growing up were abusive and horrible drug addicts. His mom is clean now but his dad does hard drugs \u201coccasionally.\u201d \nNow on to the story. My fianc\u00e9 is always trying to tell me how to do things. He wants them done his way but doesn\u2019t want to help out. Especially things pertaining to our son. Which irritates me more than it should. He hasn\u2019t worked in 6 months but still doesn\u2019t help. He changes one or two diapers every three days. He does wash the bottles when they\u2019re all dirty and I\u2019m busy. And he gives the baby a bath every other night. \nSo, we\u2019re laying in bed one night and we\u2019re discussing our son and ways we wanted to raise him. We had a bit of a disagreement and he said, \u201cyou know what my dad always said.\u201d I cut him off and said, \u201cNo thanks, I don\u2019t care what an abusive drug addict has to say.\u201d This obviously hurt his feelings. He replied with, \u201cwell then I don\u2019t want to hear anything else about your mom. I always have to hear about how hard this time of year for you is.\u201d I was hurt by this, mainly because this was around the time my mom went missing. So I said, \u201care you really comparing my dead mother to your alive father?\u201d We didn\u2019t talk anymore after this. So I am wondering if I took things too far? \nTL;DR: I think I may be an asshole because I said I didn\u2019t care what my fianc\u00e9\u2019s abusive drug addict dad had to say.\n\nETA: I do want to add that I do not talk about the way my mother parented. I have no desire to do any parenting the way she did. I loved my mom, and yes we didn\u2019t have a good relationship. But no I did not think she was a good mom. Also, when my fianc\u00e9 says, \u201cyou know what my dad always said.\u201d It always a smart ass remark afterwards. This is not me trying to excuse what I said.

Girl, you have every right to be irritated with a stay-at-home-non-parent who issues fucking commands while offloading all the work to you. That's not your partner, that's your boss. \n\nWhy do you think you should ever put up with this behavior? Why on earth do you think you shouldn't be irritated with it? Why does he act like royalty in your home?", "NTA, you are acting out because your fiancee is not pulling his weight in the parental care for your child and the things in the household. The conversation about the parents might have been for something else too and might have still resulted in this sort of argument. He needs to start taking responsibility for his part of this partnership and you need to communicate this more directly and not out of frustration.", "NTA regarding the comment but op why are you still with a dude who barely contributes to parenting and not at all towards bills?", "NTA. You are right, no comparison. They both weren't great parents but not knowing what happened to your mum must be hard. His dad is not a role model he should tried to put on a pedestal or emulate. You can love someone but still acknowledge their short comings. It doesn't have to be one or the other.\n\nCertainly, he needs to start supporting you more because it seems to be that this relationship isn't bringing much positive at the moment, and that you are growing resentful. He needs to ask himself what type of father he wants to be, and try his best to be that. You also need to have a serious chat about your financial situation, and that if you have to work he will have to step up as a dad. However, you may also want to check for potential sign of depression.\n\nIn any case, I think you both needs therapy I believe to cope with the trauma of your childhood.", "NTA. Maybe you could've put it more gently than \"I don't care what an abusive drug addict has to say\u201d, but what you said makes a lot of sense. I don't think your bf understood it anyway, since he only received it as \"don't talk to me about your parents\" and not as \"your father is not the best person to take parental advice from for obvious reasons\".\n\nAnd your fiance not helping out with an infant child while being unemployed for 6 months is ... very questionable.", "NTA, except you are to yourself and your child because you had a child with this person and you're still with this person.

You also are being unfair to yourself by staying with someone so lazy.\n\nHe is a lazy parent and got overly malicious in response to you.", "ESH\n\nYou could have phrased your comment about your fianc\u00e9's father more politely but you made sure to insult him which escalated an argument.\n\nBut your fianc\u00e9 also sucks for insulting your currently missing mother and overall being a bad parent by not taking care of your son.", "NTA.. he's showing you who he is by 1) how he is with his son, and 2) his reply to that. I would recommend saving up and finding a way to leave. It will only get worse.", "NTA and your fiance is being a lazy bum.  It's bad enough you had a kid with a bum, don't compound the mistake by marrying one.  He sounds like an ass as well as a bum if he keeps spouting off what his father said as if he thinks it's funny or something.", "YTA , for bringing a kid into this mess . Also if your mother disappeared in a drug deal gone wrong , then you shouldn't be throwing around drug related insults and then not expect it to come back at you", "ETA - if you love someone and you want to have a good relationship, you don\u2019t cut off their feelings and shame them. While his dad may not be a good man, that doesn\u2019t mean your BF didn\u2019t take anything positive from him. And denying him the positive aspects of their relationship is toxic behaviour in its own right. If you want him to hear you, you must also hear him. Build each other up, heal his wounds from his family and past and help him find the good pieces so that you can help him elevate his person, the same way you would want him\nTo do for you, and more importantly your child. \nHe\u2019s the asshole for not participating in full, the life of your son. You can\u2019t choose when to help, he has to be there for you both all the time. \nI think this whole relationship sounds painful. Try to keep this in mind, if you are thinking about your partners pains and needs as much as your own, to u create the space for them to be comfortable and to heal, and also teach them how you want to be treated. It all may fail anyway, but shaming someone is not the way to move forwards.", "YTA. People with missing junkie parents shouldn't throw junkie parents at glass houses.", "ESH", "Do you live in a crackhouse ?", "YTA - you both come from screwed up families and you both understand what addiction can do to a family.  You said that because you knew it would hurt him.  Don't do that.", "ESH\n\n&#x200B;\n\nthe fact that shes dead doesnt make her a better person...weird take...", "NTA,.\n\nI think you could of worded it better and ended up with a much different result.\n\nJust because people do some social unacceptable stuff, doesn't always mean what they say is always awful. Plus you could of heard it out and just gently disregarded it anyway.\n\nYour s/o made it a point scoring exercise with his response to what you said and you joined in. Idk what to say in that situation but sometimes silence speaks louder than words, enough to make someone question what they said and rethink at least.", "YTA. I get the context around it and your frustration at him not helping but in this situation: yeah you started it. If you don't want someone to clap back with something hurtful don't start an argument.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
