Idk if this is something you do regularly in your family or had done to you growing up but I'd try to nip that in the bud. 12-18 is like the worst time to pick at your kid's personality traits.", "YTA, and I'm glad she knows how to tell you your truth in sign language. That's pretty cool.", "YTA. Your daughter was shy. Now you made a joke that clearly hurt her. You should've thought this through. My dad makes jokes all the time about my disability and eating disorder. It hurts. Apologize, it's not funny.", "YTA. People who complain about girls and women talking do so as a means of control.\n\nYou need to apologize.", "YTA\n\n\n\nI can imagine it was intended as a mild 'dad joke', but dude, read the room. It comes across thusly: You shit on her for being quiet, you shit on her for overcoming it.", "YTA. \nI was a talkative kid.

I feel like I hear it way more of females, and again, in a negative context. \n\nI am actually surprised by all the NAH comments. What part of this was meant to be funny, exactly?  The good old days when she was nervous and uncomfortable around you and your family?  When you were becoming part of her life instead of being there since birth, like most of her friends probably had?", "YTA. You were trying to be funny, but she is a teen and probably is very self-conscious without your teasing.

You castigate her for it. \n\nI\u2019ve found that people who talk a lot (nonstop) do so because they don\u2019t feel heard or validated. So this begs the question: what else do you say that\u2019s derogatory about her?", "YTA.\n\nBehaviours like these will bring you to ask yourself why she's not speaking to you anymore.\n\nApologize to her.", "YTA. I\u2019m sure you didn\u2019t mean anything bad by it and you just wanted to be funny, but as a talkative girl, this stuff used to make me start noticing how much I was talking and feel guilty for it.

Is her mother still around? \n\nYes, it was wrong of you to say you preferred her quiet and insecure.

I was socially anxious and not super good at being in on jokes and general social situations but I hyperfixated on stuff really intensely and would talk a mile a minute about my special interests. When Mum would make these 'jokes' it made me feel like more of a freak than my peers did and I started to believe that the things I said were worthless and yeah.. it just really, really damaged my self worth for a long time. It also increased my anxiety and made me heavily mask who I was so I wouldn't be teased anymore, which was very taxing.

She may have some neurological or emotional issues that need attention so her school life and social life does not suffer.  Ask her teachers how she is doing socially.  Ask if she can pay attention in class. Take her needs seriously. She may need help to learn social cues.\n\nAnd please don't  @ me for armchair psych diagnosis.
