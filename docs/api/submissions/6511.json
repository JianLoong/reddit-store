Don't tell me you trust him when you want him to sign a contract that he'll return your CHILD to you. You don't trust him and you don't trust his family. I'm not telling you that you should. Trust your gut. Once he's got the kid in a different state, things get complicated. So, if you truly don't trust him or them, stand your ground.

I also wouldn\u2019t allow him to take babe anywhere unsupervised\u2026.he can\u2019t be trusted.", "NTA, but what you are proposing is meaningless, legally speaking. There are all sorts of laws that govern what is considered a child\u2019s residential state. \n\nIt is more reasonable to say no to this trip.

I can't see the contract being binding BUT having a text or something in writing that he won't take the baby without your consent can't hurt.  And be prepared that if he does, you need to call the cops regarding kidnapping.  It's kidnapping.  It's not okay.  Had a gal pal who at 16, her mother's boyfriend's brother got her knocked up.  He took their baby to Mexico and left it with his parents.  He came back, gave her a car, and proposed (he was still married to someone else).  Don't be her.

Sometimes you gotta be the bad guy in someone\u2019s story, sorry NOT sorry.\nNot only that, you have NO idea if they\u2019re conspiring to have full custody themselves?

First his family sounds awful and you don\u2019t want to be closer to them and they are established meaning they have deeper pockets. Also if you let him take the kid there even with a signed agreement if he doesn\u2019t come back you will have to go 2000 miles to fight for your kid with no job and no place to stay.\n\nI think he wants to break up with and he wants the kid. He moves you can\u2019t follow right away. Now he\u2019s there you\u2019re 2000 miles away and you will have to fight him for custody and because the custody fight will take place in another state you will be stuck there until the baby turns 18. \n\nPlease don\u2019t let him keep the baby go home with your kid and think if this is the man you want to marry. \n\nNta", "YWBTA-soft though. I think a contract like you\u2019re talking about would make an already touchy issue that much more contentious and complicated. As a mom you already have rights to the child that no contract above and beyond that is going to protect more or give you more of. If you\u2019re really concerned about it meet privately with an attorney so they can outline your rights to you. As to the concern about the baby\u2019s welfare that\u2019s a little more difficult.

He would have all legal rights to take the baby out of state and she'd lose her child.", "Our plan was to move closer because he has a job there lined up that pays more than mine does, but the idea was to move together after my contract with my job ends. We\u2019re not going homeless or anything, but they claim since we have minor debt (under 2k credit card) we need to take intensive measures. \n\nI honestly have told him he needs to stand up to his parents because I\u2019m tired of doing it. It\u2019s something that\u2019s been on my mind the last month", "I agree. There is no way in hell my kid would be anywhere near them without me.  \n\nThis is such a weird shady thing to insist on, and I  would seriously rethink moving closer to them.  Guarantee they are going to try to co trol how you parent and clearly will not respect your boundaries.  \n\nDo you trust your husband to come back?  Does he wfh or is he unemployed?  The bottom line is that paper will only serve as evidence when they claim you abandoned the baby.  It won't save you or your child from the type of trauma these people are capable of.\n\nI repeat, such strong insistence to take someone else's baby is a red flag factory.", "As in yesterday!", "If he\u2019s on the birth certificate, is it legally kidnapping if there isn\u2019t a custody order in place?

He needs to find a new job in the opposite direction of his family.\n\nThey will destroy your relationship and push every single boundary much like they are doing now.\n\nDo NOT let him take the baby up there.

Granted, may vary by state, but this very specifically says \u201cParental kidnapping happens when one parent takes their child without the consent of the other.  There are two main ways this happens.  1 - one parent violates a custody agreement and takes off with the child.  2 - there is no custody agreement in place, and one parent leaves with the child without consent from the other parent\u201d. https://kinglawoffices.com/blog/family-law/what-is-parental-kidnapping/ Admit its not so cut and dry in the later, but the mother can seek an emergency custody order to either keep this from happening, or to retrieve her child if it does happen.  Again, varies by state, and I don\u2019t know where she is.", "Not true. There IS an agreed upon custodial arrangement - they all live in the same house together. The house is the baby's permanent address, and the baby is a legal resident of the state she lives in. The other parent absolutely cannot just take off over state lines and relocate the baby. Cause if that guy goes for \"a visit\" he's not coming back.", "That's not true.  One of my friends had her soon to be ex husband take their kid to another state and he stayed and kept the kid. She had to go through all kinds of court stuff but the dad did indeed get charged for kidnapping", "Damn - so if one parent took a child away without the other parent\u2019s permission, there\u2019s nothing that can be done??  Ugh.", "Ideally that would be best!  But she wouldn\u2019t know that an innocent trip to the store could yield him taking off to his parents\u2019.", "You don't think a child does the same thing with a father?", "Don't let him take baby? Since he doesn't have a job, kick him out of house?", "Sounds like the option his parents are giving is about them.  Where they move live with his parents, get our of debt and begin to save.  \n\nNot saying its the correct course of action but it's not like there's not a logical reason behind their idea", "This is the comment! OP you really need to ask yourself what your life is going to look like should you be closer to them. They\u2019re exerting this much influence and feeling in you and that with them being 2000miles away! I don\u2019t know what friends, family and support network you\u2019ll be leaving but now is not the time to shy away from serious discussions with your partner.", "I didn\u2019t say your advice was bad, I was genuinely curious.", "Which is why I wouldn't support OP taking the baby 2000 miles away for 14 days away from the father. But the OP hasn't asked to do that, has she?", "If you can\u2019t pay off a 2k debt without your parents help, you\u2019re in no position to buy a house anyway. Also the way I read it is that they had plans to move in a few months when OPs employment contract is up. Seems like the family wants the father and baby to move 2000 miles away without OP while she finishes up the job. \n\nAs someone with kids, it\u2019s pure insanity to ask that a mother be away from her 7 month old child for several months. Even floating an idea like that is pretty nefarious in my opinion and actually evil to continue to try and manipulate the father to do it", "Yea i get that. My issue was the original person phasing as \"your baby\" as if the father had 0 rights", "Absolutely. Expecting a new mom to just hand her baby off for months?????? That\u2019s INSANE! Horrible people. Stay far far away from them.", "... but it is her baby"]}
