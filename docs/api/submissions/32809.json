She should of been the one to kick her Mother out, or better yet, shut down her entitled behavior, before the wedding.", "NTA", "NTA \n\nYou should to a wedding bow renewal in Vegas at some point. Give yourself a good memory.", "How old is your MIL? Does she have any additional care needs?\n\nI'm asking as I'm wondering how much of an insult trying to stick her in a \"senior living\" facility might be for her.", "NTA \nI don\u2019t blame you one bit. She needs to live and pay for her own. I am sorry you had such a bad experience at your own wedding. Let it go and enjoy married life with just your wife!", "NTA. Not kicking her out would be akin to encouraging that behaviour.", "NTA but you and your wife should do counseling. She needs to do individual and see how her mother was wrong. Your wife needs to stand for you and the marriage nor for her mom.", "NTA, someone should have stood up to her years ago, it seems", "She is 69 going in 70 on feb 10", "Photoshop.  Solves the two white dresses problem...puce is a popular choice.  Tangerine.  Bilirubin brown.  Make sure she gets a copy in a nice frame for her room at the home.\n\nPerhaps therapy would be something to look into for your wife and some couples therapy as well.  Poor wife has been programmed by her horrid mother for a long time and could probably use some help dealing with her.\n\nCongrats and mazel tov!  Long life and much happiness to you and DW!", "Your MIL has main character syndrome sounds like a complete and total narcissist and your wife should\u2019ve got her together when she bought a white dress to wear to your wedding. MIL ruined your wedding and I wouldn\u2019t have anything to say to her after that. And the messed up thing is your wife allowed it to happen.\nHope your marriage is worth it.", "NTA. MIL is ungrateful. You did the right thing.", "NTA", "NTA. I petty enough that I would go back to the photographer and have them photoshop your wedding picture to add 50 pounds, a nose wart and tint her dress puke green.", "Can someone explain what OP means in the first sentence? I\u2019m so confused. Was OP with MIL at some point?", "> the whole time living in MY HOUSE she has been ungrateful refusing to pay bills and won\u2019t thank for the food me and my wife bring\n\nAnd you wonder why she ruined your wedding ? I don't understand, I don't house mean or bad people.", "Question: Has MIL been evaluated for neurological disorders - early onset dementia, Alzheimer\u2019s, Parkinson\u2019s? If not , she sounds like a candidate.\n\nUntil addressed - as this problem has been ongoing, how/why did you expect her behaviors would change during a wedding?", "ESH.\n\nYour MiL crossed so many lines.\nYour wife is an enabler of her narcissistic mom and can\u2019t see her mom is toxic.\nYou made a married couple choice without your wife\u2026never do that, especially about an in law. \n\nBut I also don\u2019t think this was new or surprise behavior, so really, what was everyone expecting of her? To suddenly behave when she hasn\u2019t this far? \n\nAlso, your story is clearly a story in some parts - no way an assisted living facility or any facility let her move in the next day and I highly doubt you kicked her out without having another place to live. \n\nShe needs to not be in your house because your MIL is a narcissistic abuser who views her daughter as hers and clearly resents you for taking attention away from your mil. Everything she does is about ruining the relationship between you two so she can feel like she is the most important thing to her daughter. For the sake of everyone, do not let her live with you and do not let your wife fall for her mils lies that she has changed\u2026she will be secretly undermining your relationship left and right and it will make your home no longer your sanctuary.", "Wait, is this a language thing, or do you mean that you and your MIL had a romantic relationship together?\n\nBecause that is wierd as hell. Especially now that you refer to her as old, and talking about putting her in a home. And she refers to your wife as her daughter.\nI really hope it is a language thing.\n\nEdit, to clarify, this is what I am probably misunderstanding:\n\"...me and her MIL have a past since we were together\"\nDoesn't having a past and being together indicate a romantic relationship?", "NTA\n\nShe can stay in the senior home.", "either ask your photographer or r/photoshop to change your MIL gown color.", "SO MUCH NTA!!   And you need a do-over wedding, without Old Sour Face White Dress.", "OoooooWeeee honey y'all are better than me, I would have gone to the jail!

You wife should be thanking you for removing the poison.", "Every one has an opinion. NTA\u2026fr what you have said she has been a thorn in your side for a long time. She could have helped around the house. She could have been happy for her daughter as she seems to love you. Trying to ruin the wedding was the end. You have a lot of patience. When she said \u201c Oh Please \u201c, I would have took her aside and said \u201cOne more thing negative and I will call you a cab.\u201d Good luck with your new wife.", "NTA-I would have a serious conversation with your wife.  No ultimatums but asks if she really feels it\u2019s wrong considering what she did and still is putting you both through.  Ask her if she really wants her mom to move back at most likely the expense of your marriage if she goes back.  Again no ultimatums.  If she can\u2019t move on ask her if she needs help because in the end even though she is gone your MIL is still having a negative impact on your relationship and this can\u2019t continue for you both to be successful.", "Definitely NTA.", "NTA but your wife is if she thinks it was to far", "NTA.  You should have kicked her out from your home ages ago and kicked her out of your wedding.", "NTA.\n\nTell your wife this is your line in the sand.  Either she supports you in this, or the marriage is over.\n\nNTA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "NTA and your MIL is clearly unhinged BUT you have a wife problem", "NTA  \n\n\nThe fact your wife isn't 100% on your side is troubling though.   \nUnless MIL has dementia or something he behaviors is not excusable.   \nShe needs to go in a home now.", "NTA.  You did nothing wrong.  She wants to live in your house for free, not contribute or pay bills.  Then she makes multiple scenes at your wedding.  Hell no, if it was me I'd never talk to her again.  She doesn't respect you or your marriage.  Your wife needs to grow a spine.  Her mother is responsible for all of this.  All she had to do was contribute, pay a couple bills, and keep her mouth shut.  She was unable to do any of that, so now she's experiencing the results.", "nope. you are not...MIL is a piece of work,,,,,", "NTA. This is your wedding, and your life, not just your wife's. I understand she loves her mom, but she needs to prioritize your relationship over making her mom happy. Talk to your wife asap, and make sure you're on the same page.", "NTA\n\n>she yelled \u201cGIVE ME MY DAUGHTER BACK\"\n\nDang.  That's a new one.  On the plus side, that's so over the top that one day you'll find it funny.  Just wow!\n\nI suspect your wife is feeling really guilty even though the two of you were in the right.  It's easy to say, \"Time to stand up to Mom/MiL\" but quite another to actually do it.  We're wired to want our parents' love no matter what.  And since MiL is currently behaving, it may be causing your wife to second guess herself even worse.  She's wrong for backtracking on the decision, but it's all too understandable.", "NTA. You did exactly the right thing. Proud of you!", "NTA", "nta", "Every time your wife ask about MIL moving back in ask her if she enjoyed her wedding.", "NTA - I\u2019d toss her stuff out and change the locks", "why would let a leech stay at your place when not only she's taking advantage of you, she's also keeps disrespecting you over and over?\n\n  \nNTA, tell your wife she can go live with her mom if she wants it so bad but that MIL won't ever be welcome at your place unless she actually apologizes and stops being a GD asshole", "[removed]", "Uh, the wife has been standing there letting her mother behave this way to her husband. I\u2019d get it annulled.", "this \"be gentle with your wife\" is BS!!! she's a grown woman who KNOWS how her mother behaves and hasn't even stood up for herself, let alone her husband. if OP was a woman, y'all would be ROASTING the partner rn but bc it's a man, he should \"be gentle\" gtfoh", "Because you think it's easy for him. We never advocate for victim to stand up for themselves, then don't expect anything to change", "It is a bit confusing because of the grammatical errors, but when OP is saying \u201csince we were together\u201d they mean themselves and fianc\u00e9 (not MIL).
