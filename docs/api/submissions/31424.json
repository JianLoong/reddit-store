Drug issues now (benzos and who knows what else probably opioids) but growing up she was always the problem child. Liked to get into things and have interesting friends which caused our parents a lot of headache. She got pregnant at 16 with a guy nearly double her age and our mom made her get rid of it. So she has a lot of anger towards our parents for that. She then got pregnant again at 22 and moved out and has moved in and out every year since then. She has stole from our parents and they have spent a lot of time and money keeping her afloat. She has 3 kids and my mom hasn\u2019t had a vacation in over a decade since she babysits and takes care of them. My sister barely takes care of her own kids and often disappears for days leaving our mom to deal with her kids. I go really feel bad for both of them. Our dad took lots of overtime all the time because they are basically the kids parents and they are getting older (mid 60s around retirement age) and can\u2019t retire. But I\u2019ve told them to stop being involved, move away and let her deal with her own shit and they won\u2019t. I\u2019ve had enough dealing with my sister, she tried to flirt with my then bf now husband when we went over for the holidays one year and she acts in such irrational ways. Our parents helped her get jobs from friends who are business owners and she has caused them to lose those friendships because of her actions at work. I stay far away from her. \n\nMy parents called me a few months ago asking for money because of my dad who recently had a heart attack he has been forced to retire and they don\u2019t have money apart from old age pension. There is a over 55 condo they bought to retire in over a decade ago and they can\u2019t go because of the grandkids. I told them to go there and they said they can\u2019t because they still have the grandkids to take care of. I told them I can\u2019t help. I want to but our parents have burned so much money on my sister that if I start opening my bank account to them I will be broke in no time. I told them they should go talk to the condo management about bringing the grandkids and they said they did and there is no excepts. My mom argued they only need 700 a month to keep their current home and I should be willing to help my nieces. I told her she use to have everything paid off, and ready to retire but helping my sister is a trap and cost them their retirement and I refuse to get involved. She keeps calling and texting me saying they are putting their house up for sale and recently sold. They had put a reverse mortgage on it years ago because of my sister but that\u2019s dried up and now they can\u2019t pay the taxes insurance utilities etc. She keeps telling me I have a responsibility to my nieces and I don\u2019t like my sister but she\u2019s still family. I have money both my husband and I are engineers but I refuse to get involved with anything to do with my sister including helping her kids.

Your parents aren\u2019t assholes for wanting to help their grandchildren.  Those kids are innocent and did nothing to put themselves in the situation of having a deadbeat Mom. Looking after kids you are related to who have a horrible parent is not poor financial management, it is compassion and an act of love.   \n You can blame your parents for how your sister turned out, but they also raised you, so must not have been terrible parents if you turned out okay. Helping her children is not enabling your sister, it is protecting children who had no part in her decisions.  If they are actively supporting her to get drug money it\u2019s one thing, but protecting children from an addict is totally different.  You are not required to help them but it does seem very cold to me, especially if your parents were also there for you when you needed them.  People here are so quick to suggest to cut people off .  My parents are both gone, and I would do anything to help them if they were still in this world. Hoarding money while people you love suffer, doesn\u2019t do you any good in the long run.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your parents let your sister as an adult financially ruin their lives.  Your parents allowed that to happen.  You're absolutely right, that you will end up in the same horrible situation by giving any money to them.  I would not get involved financially.  Where is your sister now that they're left to raise three kids?  Is she on the streets somewhere? What does she say about your parents not being able to afford their current home any longer? Where is the father of these children?  Do you know who he is and if his family can step in here?

The best and only thing that you can do is 529s so they have an education fund with your and their names only.

Then they will buy a normal condo probably to move into or rent. The over 55 condo is valued much lower than normal condos so they probably can\u2019t only afford a 1 or 2 bedroom for 5 people. And that\u2019s it, they have no retirement from raising my sister\u2019s kids and only government pension. I don\u2019t think they will even reach 75 before running out of money.

Ones to help dad recuperate and ones to get the kids some care and legal support.", "Or pay a bill directly don\u2019t give them money.", "Your sister has already sunk your parents, if you get involved today, she'll sink you too. It's a financial and emotional black hole.\n\nYou're right that all money right now will be funnelled to sister.\n\nIf you are willing one day to help out parents, you'll need to do it in a way where it can't be passed onto sister. So, for instance, you'd want to have the ability to 100% control their finances. And that point might come if/when they become unable to manage their own lives.", "So they will let her suck all their money away and then she'll leave them with zero cash and her kids and bail once they can't give her anything anymore.
