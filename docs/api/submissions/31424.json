Drug issues now (benzos and who knows what else probably opioids) but growing up she was always the problem child. Liked to get into things and have interesting friends which caused our parents a lot of headache. She got pregnant at 16 with a guy nearly double her age and our mom made her get rid of it. So she has a lot of anger towards our parents for that. She then got pregnant again at 22 and moved out and has moved in and out every year since then. She has stole from our parents and they have spent a lot of time and money keeping her afloat. She has 3 kids and my mom hasn\u2019t had a vacation in over a decade since she babysits and takes care of them. My sister barely takes care of her own kids and often disappears for days leaving our mom to deal with her kids. I go really feel bad for both of them. Our dad took lots of overtime all the time because they are basically the kids parents and they are getting older (mid 60s around retirement age) and can\u2019t retire. But I\u2019ve told them to stop being involved, move away and let her deal with her own shit and they won\u2019t. I\u2019ve had enough dealing with my sister, she tried to flirt with my then bf now husband when we went over for the holidays one year and she acts in such irrational ways. Our parents helped her get jobs from friends who are business owners and she has caused them to lose those friendships because of her actions at work. I stay far away from her. \n\nMy parents called me a few months ago asking for money because of my dad who recently had a heart attack he has been forced to retire and they don\u2019t have money apart from old age pension. There is a over 55 condo they bought to retire in over a decade ago and they can\u2019t go because of the grandkids. I told them to go there and they said they can\u2019t because they still have the grandkids to take care of. I told them I can\u2019t help. I want to but our parents have burned so much money on my sister that if I start opening my bank account to them I will be broke in no time. I told them they should go talk to the condo management about bringing the grandkids and they said they did and there is no excepts. My mom argued they only need 700 a month to keep their current home and I should be willing to help my nieces. I told her she use to have everything paid off, and ready to retire but helping my sister is a trap and cost them their retirement and I refuse to get involved. She keeps calling and texting me saying they are putting their house up for sale and recently sold. They had put a reverse mortgage on it years ago because of my sister but that\u2019s dried up and now they can\u2019t pay the taxes insurance utilities etc. She keeps telling me I have a responsibility to my nieces and I don\u2019t like my sister but she\u2019s still family. I have money both my husband and I are engineers but I refuse to get involved with anything to do with my sister including helping her kids.

Helping her children is not enabling your sister, it is protecting children who had no part in her decisions.  If they are actively supporting her to get drug money it\u2019s one thing, but protecting children from an addict is totally different.  You are not required to help them but it does seem very cold to me, especially if your parents were also there for you when you needed them.  People here are so quick to suggest to cut people off .  My parents are both gone, and I would do anything to help them if they were still in this world.

No amount of money will fix her if she won't fix herself. \n\nAll they're doing is keeping her from rock bottom and spending themselves out of being able to help her or the kids.
