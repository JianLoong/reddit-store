Once a kid hits a certain age- it can be quite weird for them ride in a booster. 10 or 11 is definately at that age. 3/4th grade in our house and we stopped. Getting dropped off at 5th grade or 6th riding in a booster seat is not normal for kiddos.", "YTA. I mean, it's so low stakes, you're not really an asshole.

This is when you gotta step up as a big bro and help him out. \n\nIt seems this thread is dead set on the height requirement, but outside of the Reddit hive mind, no one uses one for that long.

Lmao internet strangers get so upset then resort to petty insults.", "Physics don't care about age or maturity. Regular car seats and belts are designed for average-size adults. Anyone much shorter than that is safer if they compensate by using a special seat. The seat is not there to restrain the passenger from acting like a toddler, it's to minimize injury risk in case of a collision. \n\nActually everyone including adults SHOULD sit facing backwards since that is much safer; normal cars are unfortunately not designed to make this practical. I am a large grown-ass man and on buses and trains I always do sit backwards if I have the choice."]}
