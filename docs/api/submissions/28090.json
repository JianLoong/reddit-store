{"id": 28090, "submission_id": "16y6xb3", "title": "WIBTA if I questioned why my 7yo wasn't invited to a birthday party?", "selftext": "So, first some backstory/context. My son is 7 and his \"best friend\", who we'll call George, have been friends for four years. They've both been to each others bday parties the last few years. I'm a single mom and my son is my only child so whenever I take him somewhere (skatepark, swimming, the park, the fair, local Waterpark, etc) I always invite George to come so my son has someone other than just me to have fun with. We've also been invited to events at their house as well. We live across the street so the boys are ALWAYS playing together either here or there. They pretty much do everything together. \n\nOn to the issue... George's bday is this Thursday so I was expecting to hear about his party soon, last week I even asked him what he wanted, present wise. \n\nWell yesterday my son wanted to go outside and play and ofc went over to ask if George could come outside. George's dad answered the door and said that he wasn't home. Ok, no biggie. My son came back home and decided to do something else for a bit. After a little while I offered to go out front with my son to play since it was so nice outside. When we went out our other neighbors were out too (they have a daughter that my son likes to play with too). So my son asked if she could come out and play. That's when the bomb dropped. Her mom said that she was at George's bday party! And asked why we weren't there... now apparently their daughter, in her mother's words, invited herself to go and George's family said yes.  So I thought, 'Well maybe this party was just for family and he'll have another party for his friends to come to'. George has a pretty big family and they've done stuff like that before. So I figured I'd ask George today when I get him and my son from the bus stop.\n\nSo today, during our walk I asked George if he was having another party for friends and he said, no. Now according to him my son was supposedly invited.  Since hearing that I've checked my phone to see if I missed a text or a call, which I haven't. I checked through our mail/mailbox to see if I missed an invitation, and didn't find anything. I also thought back to yesterday when my son went over to ask if George could come outside and all his dad said was that he wasn't home, deliberately leaving out that the party was about to happen soon, wherever it was taking place. \n\nNow my son's feelings are hurt. Heck, my feelings are hurt. I'm also pretty sure there's no bad blood because earlier today his dad texted me for a favor. \n\nSo WIBTA if I asked his family why my son wasn't invited?", "created_utc": 1696277415, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16y6xb3/wibta_if_i_questioned_why_my_7yo_wasnt_invited_to/", "score": 70, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It would be reasonable to reach out to his parents and just check in and say you noticed your son wasn\u2019t invited and it\u2019s totally fine if he wants to dial down the amount of time they spend together, just let you know.

You are NTA.", "OP, instead of confrontation you can view is as an inquiry and want to find out if something happened between the boys that you were unaware of. I\u2019m sorry this happened to your son. Please keep us updated. NTA.", "NTA just ask them both for your benefit as well. They can't have their cake and eat it too. You need to teach your son this life lesson of finding your value. They most likely will say a bs reason, don't fight it but you will need to tell them okay, I accept that but this will change the dynamics here, I will no longer be inviting him to our outings or doing any favours for you.

On one hand, there isn\u2019t an entitlement to an invitation. However, if there is something wrong, you should know about it. \n\nI\u2019d suggest asking, but doing so in a non-confrontational way.

She just took the opportunity to ask him. \n\nHer son is 7 years old so it's understable she worries and hands his life. It's not like she is controling his enterely social life.
