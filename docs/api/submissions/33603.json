We did Xmas with him last year at her house when he visited her for the second time in 28 years. The dude's simply unbearable - talks the whole time bragging about how $ he makes, how cool he is, etc. All b.s. When he returned this year we told my stepdaughter that we won't be doing xmas with her and her dad again; I'd rather get a handy from Eddie Scissorhands, tbh. We decided to skip the country from the 24th to 31st.  \nHere's the problem: my stepdaughter now lives with her bf in a tiny house and there's no room for 9 people (both their families) for xmas dinner. So my super kind wife offered our house for them to do xmas dinner at; except we won't be there. Worse yet, she didn't even run it by me first. She simply went ahead and offered it. I was not on board with that and told her no, I wasn't ok with that. I don't want her ex at my house having eggnog and farting on my couch when I'm out of the country. In fact, I don't want him there ever. He's a deadbeat dad and the situation seems weird af.  \nSo now she had to go back to them and tell them that I 86ed their xmas dinner at my house and everyone is pissed at me. Now I have to go halfway across the world on vacation with a pissed wife and the rest of the family hates me.

I'll bet the dinner at your house will go ahead anyways..", "NTA....that is bizarre that her first instinct was to offer up the house too, let's be realistic,  some strangers as well as her daughter and not run it by you first.", "This.  Your wife created the situation by not asking you beforehand. It\u2019s not normal to let an ex use your house to celebrate Christmas when you will literally be out of the country.  NTA.", "its her house. she said they can use it. its really not that hard dawg. i dont care about his story about it. she said they can use her house. take it up with her.", "Or depending on when all the decisions were made, he could've rented out a place.", "And most big decisions require two yeses.

You won\u2019t be there after all.", "No, just no.", "Jealous of what?  The fair weather father?  If the guys so loaded he can have thanksgiving at his house or a place he pays for.

Your wife is crazy\n\nthat aint what you said dawg. not hatin, just sayin.", "That's a good point about the bio dad.\n\nI thought about this in terms of just shared living space. Offering your space to people especially when you're not home- you ask. All the stuff that goes into hosting a dinner party is a lot.

When I said my house, I meant if I was in that situation with my own spouse, it would be my house.  It wouldn\u2019t be our house because neither you, me, or OP is my spouse.  It would still be me and my spouses house, not just mine, but she isn\u2019t involved in this conversation.  When I say their house, I mean OP and his spouse. Jesus learn possessive words.", "right i understand that. \n\nbut you have a spouse so you dont have a \"my house\". right? you have an \"our house\"\n\nso answer the question. you say someone cant come to our house, and she says they can come to our house. what do you do?", "NTA your wife created this situation. She set up a trap and your stepdaughter and others fell in it. Just don't argue with the wife and enjoy your holiday.\n\nEdit: op, who owns the house? At what percentages?", "Ntah she made a mistake by assuming you would just go along with it.  Why would you host an event that you weren't even part of?  Sounds like opening up your home to a bunch of unnecessary drama.", "NTA.  My wife would NEVER have done this nonsense.  The fuck was she thinking.", "Nta. So she is handing your house over to a dead beat ex who was loaded but never sent you two dime and without ever asking you.", "50/50. Everything owned jointly.", "Doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019s foregoing events, just doesn\u2019t want to host the deadbeat.  I would not, but if someone else is hosting they can invite whomever they want.", "Yes, just yes.", "Beth and I go way back. Thanks for the house.", "I admire the patience you have to properly explain it each time and with further detail as you go and then to see them still arguing with you is enough to trigger me and I'm not even involved."]}
