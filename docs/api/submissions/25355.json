She rents and pays roughly $3000 in rent, utilities, and insurance. I outright own a house that my brothers gave to me as a graduation gift. My utilities, insurance, and property tax is roughly $2500 a month. She makes about $50,000 a year while I make about $300,000. All of this cumulated into the argument we\u2019re currently in.\n\nI asked her to pay $1250 a month when she moves in to cover the cost of living here. I thought that was a reasonable request since there will be 2 people living here and that\u2019s half of my cost. She disagrees and thinks it\u2019s unreasonable since I\u2019ll incur those cost whether or not she lives with me. I asked her what she thought was fair and her first answer was that she shouldn\u2019t have to contribute anything since the house was in my name and she doesn\u2019t have ownership. That led to an argument until she relented and offered to pay based on our income. Since I make 6 times her salary, she said the only fair thing is for her to pay 1/6 the cost, so roughly $400 a month. I thought this was unrealistic but she argued that it\u2019s fair since I don\u2019t even need her money because I don\u2019t have a mortgage and make so much more.\n\nI love her and never thought money would be an issue but here we are.

And tbh I don\u2019t think you should move in until you have a frank discussion about money and how you see your relationship going in the future.\n\nI personally think that if you\u2019re in a serious relationship and you\u2019re likely to stay together for good/want to get married etc. then you don\u2019t need to think about things as 50/50 (money wise at least). There are significant monetary benefits for both of you by living together- and while I get your point about splitting things down the middle I don\u2019t think her request to pay for things based on income is unreasonable.\n\nIf you want things to always be 50/50 (even if you have kids etc) you need to tell her that, and she has the right to rethink the relationship. Although tbh if you see a future with her what are you trying to save all your money for? Surely spending your joint money together would benefit you and her? I.e if you want to go for a lovely holiday and she can\u2019t afford it wouldn\u2019t you still want her to come? I just think you can\u2019t always treat money as 50/50.\n\nHowever if it\u2019s that you haven\u2019t been together long and you\u2019re not that serious yet then I think 50/50 is fine.", "I have trouble believing she\u2019s paying $3k a month on rent while only making $50k a year. Even $1250 a month is difficult to afford on that salary.\n\nEta: $3k a month would be almost 75% of her income going to rent\u2026", "JFC where do you live that your utilities, rent and insurance are $2500?\n\nYes, what you\u2019re offering is better than her $3K in rent\u2026 but your incomes are wildly, wildly different. Like\u2026 you have a partnership\u2026 but she\u2019s essentially impoverished while you can pretty much do anything you want whenever you want. You don\u2019t want to feel taken advantage of (and ultimately resentful), but she wants to feel like a partner, instead of like she\u2019s left out in the cold to struggle while her partner is ridiculously comfortable (which will also inevitably lead to resentment). \n\nThere\u2019s a middle ground somewhere, if neither of you is feeling enough generous enough toward the other to pursue it, I\u2019d ask if you\u2019re feeling connected enough to want to stay in this relationship.  \n\nEdit:  Judgement:  a little bit of ESH.\n\nEdit 2: ooops - I totally meant \u201cproperty tax\u201d not \u201crent\u201d. Like\u2026 that\u2019s a\u2026 multimillion dollar home OP was just gifted at graduation?  That\u2019s wild.", "All I can say is that if I loved someone and made *six fucking times* what they made, I wouldn't be asking that.", "Wow, she pays 3k a month on 50k per year? That\u2019s nuts. I\u2019m not even sure how that is possible. \n\nI think her proposal for $400 a month is fair honestly. If you guys are planning to build a life together, that makes sense considering your income. Maybe make it $650 as a compromise. \n\nNAH", "I would say this is a ESH - \n\nKnowing the discrepancy in income, it's not fair of you to ask her to cover 1/2 of the bills - it SHOULD be based on income, if you're trying to be fair. \n\nShe shouldn't feel entitled to live rent-free, and should want to contribute to household costs. \n\nI will say - if you don't NEED her money, perhaps she could contribute in a way that feels less like she's subsidizing a home you own (and she'll legally have no right to). Groceries, utilities, etc. are smaller bills she could cover, which would benefit both of you.", "IDK, If my girlfriend who made 50k/year wanted to move into my house that I own outright and I made 300k/year, I likely wouldn't even make her pay. That said, I think paying based on income is extremely fair for a loved one. Especially when you consider that your ratio of discretionary income is even larger than 1-6.\n\nI do wonder how she could afford 3000 in rent , but that's another thing.\n\nI'm going to go with YTA.", "NAH\n\nIt's tough to be fair. I'll suggest that this should be broken into three categories:\n\n1) Costs associated with your house are yours to bear. This means you cover mortgage, insurance, repairs, etc.\n\n2) Costs related to utilities, internet, food, etc. should be split down the middle\n\n3) Living in the house also has value and she should compensate you for that. She has no say in what you own and shouldn't be penalized. I'd say look at what a decent two-bedroom apartment would cost in rent then divide that in half and that should be the max she should pay in \"rent\". I'd even say it should be less due to the power imbalance with living in your house.", "A few weeks ago there was a similar post, written from the GF who was moving in. I think the answers at that time were that she should definitely pay SOMETHING but that particular number is somewhat hard to land on. \"I should get to pay nothing\" is not fair so I'll go NTA.\n\nWhere I went with that other post, personally, related more to what would be fair market rent in that OP's region. Obviously you've noted she's paying $3k/month now, so paying 40% of that would be a pretty big improvement for her. I do think the TREMENDOUS disparity in your incomes - and the fact that you were GIVEN a house - makes a difference here. I'd be inclined to say it should be something between $1250 as you suggested and $400 as she did, maybe it's $800 or 1000 for instance...that would equate to a HUGE reduction in living costs for her, and would make a dent in your expenses to be sharing with her.", "NTA. How is your girlfriend paying $3k a month for housing when making $50,000? I\u2019m genuinely terrified. \n\nUnless y\u2019all get married, you have no obligation to let her live with you. You are offering her a nice house to live in for $1250 a month. She is welcome to accept that offer or decline it. It sounds like you are giving her a good deal, but it\u2019s up to her if she wants to accept it or not.", "Yta you make *six times* as much as her and want her to pay an equal percentage? With such a HUGE difference, the percentage method is more fair.  You want her to spend a huge chunk of her salary while you pay a much, much smaller percentage.", "I\u2019m going NTA considering she thought she shouldn\u2019t have to pay anything. There\u2019s still wear and tear, taxes, maintenance, increase in utilities since there will be two people. What about groceries? Items for house? Is she expecting that? What if you go on vacation together? Does she think you\u2019ll foot the bill?\n\nI think you need to hold off on moving in together, go to couples counseling, and a financial planner. If you decide to move in, draw up a legal document delineating costs, etc. in case things go sour down the road. I think with the huge income disparity some type of arrangement based on income is probably the way to go.", "NAH. This is discussing responsibility dynamics if you two were to ever marry.\n\nI agree she shouldn't be supplementing YOUR usage, but you shouldn't supplement hers. She's correct that you're incurring your own costs if she doesn't move in. Your bills don't go up unless you start consuming more water and power by yourself, but they do if SHE moves in. Her moving in is saving her $3,000.00 and you're not looking to gouge her, but you're not looking to be taken advantage of. \n\nHave her pay what's over and above your normal usage. If you have some bills set on budget billing, have her set aside 15% because until the bill reflects actual usage, you will apply it to the bill when the change happens.\n\nI'm shrugging my shoulders over the \"house not being in her name, too\" because it's likely she doesn't want to invest in half of a dwelling that she could just one day be kicked out of without any claim or right. \n\nMaybe having her take over a utility bill outright would help?", "NAH, maybe E S H but let's be nice. \n\nShe should absolutely pay something, for sure. Not just because there will be increased costs in utilities and wear and tear on the home, but because you will now be sharing the home, so you should get some relief from bills and have her contribute. \n\nBut, she isn't getting any equity in the home, so having her pay half is unfair, to me, especially when you add that you make so much more than her. I wouldn't charge a person half the costs of a home if they weren't getting any equity. I'd say 1/3 to 1/4 of the home costs is fair. Then add to that, will she have full access to the home? Does she get an equal vote in decor, in renovations? Will she have 50% of all the space in the home? If she doesn't have equal access, space, and decision making, then I'd lean more to her paying 1/4 of the costs of the home. \n\nYou both approached this from different perspectives, and you are both wrong, but not AH's yet. So come up with a compromise, BEFORE you move in together. \n\nYou also need to decide if you are splitting things 50/50 or by income, and you need to decide that now. If you do 50/50 for everything (bills, vacations, dinner out, groceries) then the budget has to be based on the lower income. For example, you can't decide to get an internet package that is $300 a month and have her pay half, if her budget only allows for $50 a month for internet. If you want to take a vacation together and you want to split the bill, you can't expect 5 star hotels and first class flights. If you want those things, you should be willing to pay more than her- not everything, just more than she does.", "$1000 sounds more than fair. She could stay where she is and be out $3000. If I had a $2000 reduction in living costs I would be GIDDY. She\u2019s being entitled. You should not be the only one contributing if you intend to live jointly. Very unequal relationship. NTA but she would be if she didn\u2019t offer SOMETHING.", "my girl ur saying ur gf is paying 72% of her salary into housing costs? what she eating for dinner ? air?", "I think that $1250 is a gift, but if she wants to try to negotiate I'd see if I could get $800/month  worth of groceries and domestic tasks added to the deal. NAH.", "NAH but there definitely needs some more talking before moving. I would also recommend a legal lease agreement when/if you can come to an agreement on who pays how much.   \nSide question: if you get married, will you add her name to the title?", "Yes you incurr those costs but you also don't share the home. If she lives with you she has costs she isn't paying.\n\nI pay for gas when someone has to drive me in a car they own.\n\nNTA", "so you're saying she pays $36,000 out of $50,000 in rent per year? \n\nSo food, transport, recreation, clothes, date nights, etc - she lives on $14,000 a year? \n\nSounds like a tough life.", "Not the asshole\nShe\u2019d have to pay someone rent! You\u2019re cutting her costs significantly!!! And your expenses are likely going up, water/electric/gas. So 1250 is a hell of a lot better than 3000. Your money is your money, doesn\u2019t matter if you make 1x or 10x more. \nDon\u2019t listen to all these freeloaders who would do the same and try to take advantage of you.", "I mean different people are different. I'd agree with her 400 a month offer or 500 offer or come to an agreement she funds one of the bills or food or something minor.", "NAH because you\u2019re communicating. But this is a relationship, not just roommates. It\u2019s a pretty standard consensus that for a healthy relationship bills should be split proportional to income. This could include everything from mortgage to water to internet, etc.", "ESH - I can barely get past some of these numbers, how the hell is she affording a $3000 place? Where do you live that you pay that much a month just for taxes, utilities, and insurance? \n\nAssuming these numbers are real, and not an application for a House Hunters episode, there is no right or standard answer here. On the one hand, it's definitely reasonable to expect your SO to contribute to the household and this could be in the form of paying utilities or buying groceries or whatever. She sucks because she is acting pretty entitled by expecting to pay nothing and throwing your income in her face. On the other hand, asking her to pay half seems like you are treating her like a tenant and just charging her rent.\n\nNormally, I think the most fair solution is that couples should rent/buy the house that the less wealthy person can afford, and if the wealthier person wants a more expensive place then they should be willing to pay the difference. But this doesn't really fit that scenario. At first glance the fact that she would still be saving a lot of money makes it seem fair, but $1250 is still 30% of her income which is maxing out the recommended housing budget. Asking her to foot half the bill is still asking her to strain her finances and make it hard for her to save or anything. It might be fair but it's not necessarily proportional. I would talk a little bit more about both of your long term goals and compromise on a number that she feels like she can comfortably afford... probably somewhere between $400 and $1250.", "So honestly I'm confused how she's able to afford $3000/mo in rent when she doesn't even make that much in salary per month after taxes or makes barely more than that\n\nBut.... Regardless of that, sorry to say, but YTA. \n\nif she is only making 50,000/year, 1250/ mo is a good chunk of that. I agree that it should be paid based on income. Why would you force her to pinch pennies on a matter of principle, and watch her struggle to make ends meet when you don't have to? What is fair doesn't necessarily mean 50/50 or equal. \n\nReally the only increase in cost you will have with her is utilities/water and you could argue space with her belongings. If you love her and want to be in a partnership with her, I'm not sure why you would ask that much of her. I fail to see what benefit you gain from asking that of her. She's not a roommate.", "The income argument is great to me. I really think that is probably the fairest way if you want to make a split finances situation work with such vast difference. \n\nOf course, your utilities will likely rise with 2 people. So honestly, I think you will end up between 450 and 500... but that seems fair to me. \n\nI get that it sucks for you to see her spend so little but 50k per year breaks down to about 10% of disposable income to housing. So if you really want to make a point going to 600 or 700 doesn't seem terrible. Anymore than that though and yes, I feel like the richer person is being greedy. \n\nJust my 2 cents though, you have to do what works for you. Somewhere you have to ask if the trust and love beats out the financial risk.", "YTA - Your GF is exactly right that she should pay an amount that is proportionate to your earnings. If you don't like her, just say that. I make significantly more than my spouse and I therefore pay a much larger portion of our monthly bills; similar to the setup your GF is proposing of about 80/20. I couldn't imagine forcing him into a larger portion when I have enough.", "Expecting OP to pay everything insulting to OP and infantilizing to GF.  Paying your fair share is part of being an adult and a partner.  Granted calling it rent was a tactical mistake.  Instead of asking for rent, OP might want to ask her to contribute to the household instead.  The GF paying the utilities while OP covers taxes, insurance, repairs, and upgrades would be fair to both since OP owns the house and GF gets to live there.  This solution would still save GF ten to twenty thousand dollars per year.", "NTA - she is saving a ton of money by moving in with you. She is a working adult, you are a working adult. Therefore bills should be split 50/50. \n\nShe\u2019s already going to be saving a bunch on her usual bills so she should be thankful. \n\nYour amount also doesn\u2019t include the added expense of second person since your basing it in just yourself. Utilities will go up. \n\nIf she can\u2019t get to that conclusion on her own then rescind the offer to cohabit. \n\nLet her continue to pay through the nose each month and keep a total of how much she\u2019d saved if she\u2019d behaved like a self responsible adult and moved in saving 1500 a month of that 3000 rent. \n\nI\u2019d also be very careful as if she\u2019s kicking a fuss now just wait until something needs to be done to the house as she won\u2019t want to pay anything to it but if you sell it for any reason as even though she is basically paying rent to live she sounds like the type to suddenly demand 50% of the equity for some weird bs reason which makes no sense but to these types of money first people.\n\n\nShe\u2019s a major red flag at this point.\n\n\nEdit to add: My partner has always almost earned more than I do and I\u2019ve always paid my share 50/50 until we decided to have a child and now thru are the earner and I raise our son and work a little on the side to cover fun activities and such. I still feel a little  uncomfortable still not paying my fair share but it\u2019s been a few years so I\u2019m sorta adjusted to being the main parent as my form of contribution.", "Maybe separate dwellings would be a good thing until she can appreciate what you're offering. Gratitude doesn't come without respect.

NTA.", "Tell her never mind, don't bother moving in, keep paying $3000 at your place.", "NTA\n\nI'd really struggle with someone suggesting they wouldn't have to contribute to the home expenses.\n\nEven if the 1/6 caculation is fair, how do you get over the fact that she expected you to give her a free ride? \n\nEveryone's asking about where your commitment to a partnership is. I think she's shown her colors in a way that I wouldn't be able to move past.", "YTA\n\nThe maths is off if she makes 50k and you 300k, then she should pay 1/7 not 1/6. Your household brings in 350k, she earns 1/7. So if the 400 is right, based on 1/6, it should actually be 342 based on 1/7. Not saying that my opinion is that bills should be split in income, just if they are, at least get the maths right.\n\nBut there\u2019s no arsehole in this discussion. It\u2019s a personal discussion.\n\nIf you want to live together that\u2019s a factor. If the choice was only, she lives with you for free, or she lives in her own place, what would you choose?\n\nShe\u2019s not a lodger, it\u2019s not \u2018what price would the free market set on a room in my house\u2019 matter.\n\nMy general take is that a partner moving into another\u2019s house, to remain equals should cover her cost, which would be 50% of electricity, water etc. but not mortgage unless that\u2019s returned in equity. And I\u2019d mitigate that 50% if bills in your house are noticeably higher than what she\u2019d have in a house she chose alone.\n\nAnd if the house was a straight out gift, and there\u2019s no mortgage, and the $1250 is pure profit, that\u2019s even worse. You want to charge your partner a grand a month for the privilege of living with you? Imagine you didn\u2019t have the house and went to live in hers, and agreed to spilt the bills 50/50, bar the fact that you feel she should put in an extra $1250 for the privilege of living with you. Obviously nuts.\n\nPartners aren\u2019t for making profit. Either you\u2019d rather she lived with you or you don\u2019t. Any money she gives you should be for her sake. She wants to cover her share of cost. So the bills you share, whether that\u2019s 50:50 or 1:6, but you don\u2019t charge rent to a girlfriend unless you met last week and she\u2019s trying to rush in for free rent.", "Do you like this person? It sounds like you're interviewing a roommate instead of moving in with your gf\n\nWith that income disparity asking for half is too much", "NTA - It would be different if you were married but you aren\u2019t.

It would piss me off in your situation.", "YTA. Paying proportional percentages is the most ethical thing to do. It\u2019s not fair for her to have less of an opportunity to build savings than you do, especially when she gets none of the benefits of home ownership.

I\u2019d never ask my partner to split things straight down the middle.", "You're not !\n\n I would go for the payments based on your income tho, it's what I've always did with my partners, and I think it's fair. But she also has good income and it's a great offer for her since she already pays 3k for rent etc. She definitely wins a part of the story! \n\nIdk how you guys work but even tho it's not on her name she should definitely pay a part because her not paying will definitely lead to any sort of arguments", "NAH. She's living at the address so she should definitely contribute to the cost of living at the address. She will be using the utilities etc after all.\n\nMost couples tend to split bills according to income so imo that would be the fairest option, you make significantly more than her, so should pay more than her.\n\nCould their be a compromise in that she pays less money but does more chores around the house as kind of a balancing act?", "NTA I personally don't like splitting it based on income unless you are married or there is a good reason to.\n\nIn this case, half of the household bills are way less than the $3k/mo she is currently paying.", "NAH:  neither of you are assholes but I'm on your side.  Luckily you haven't moved her in yet so there's no problem she will continue to pay her $3000 a month", "YTA. The most fair arrangement is always based on contributed income percentage to the household, especially when the income differers significantly. Her saying she\u2019ll pay 1/6 is actually a good deal for you, I\u2019d say she should pay 1/7. \n\nYou will still have a lot more spending money and it is really important in the perspective of power balance that both have money to spend so that no one ends up economically dependent on the other. That often leads to the one with the lower income feeling trapped or economically abused. \n\nYes, if it\u2019d been someone you don\u2019t know they should have payed half.

Money is secondary, but however you do you\u2019ll spend less on living than you do today. \n\nWith that said, do not give her shares of the house.

I can see splitting the utilities in half, but girl you own the house, the insurance and taxes are on you.\n\nAlso not going to lie, a person making 50k a year cannot afford a 3k rent.

You should both pay less than what you\u2019re currently paying, but if you\u2019re planning on keeping your finances separate, and you\u2019re not married, then you have to recognize that financially she is the one at risk- she is the one who needs to retain financial independence and feel confident that if you were to split up she isn\u2019t getting screwed. You own the house outright, so she\u2019s the one who would end up homeless, and who has no lease to protect her.

All I have to say is, I\u2019ve been in your situation and she never contributed what she promised, ended up switching to the \u201cnot costing you more for me to live here\u201d, etc, making me feel used and feeling like she wouldn\u2019t carry her weight as a longterm partner. It was a huge red flag. Also MAKE SURE that if you let her move in, you have a signed rental agreement or cohabitation agreement with an end date, which legally protects any of her rent being classified as contributing to your mortgage and therefore inferring part ownership of your home. You need an attorney who is familiar with your state laws. Finally, I\u2019d suggest progressing slowly overall. She sounds like the type of person who will quit their job without mutual agreement and expect you to cover everything forever, especially in a situation where she gets pregnant and wants to be a stay at home mom.

She rents and pays roughly $3000 in rent, utilities, and insurance. I outright own a house that my brothers gave to me as a graduation gift. My utilities, insurance, and property tax is roughly $2500 a month. She makes about $50,000 a year while I make about $300,000. All of this cumulated into the argument we\u2019re currently in.\n\nI asked her to pay $1250 a month when she moves in to cover the cost of living here. I thought that was a reasonable request since there will be 2 people living here and that\u2019s half of my cost. She disagrees and thinks it\u2019s unreasonable since I\u2019ll incur those cost whether or not she lives with me. I asked her what she thought was fair and her first answer was that she shouldn\u2019t have to contribute anything since the house was in my name and she doesn\u2019t have ownership. That led to an argument until she relented and offered to pay based on our income. Since I make 6 times her salary, she said the only fair thing is for her to pay 1/6 the cost, so roughly $400 a month. I thought this was unrealistic but she argued that it\u2019s fair since I don\u2019t even need her money because I don\u2019t have a mortgage and make so much more.\n\nI love her and never thought money would be an issue but here we are.

Is there other money she makes on the side because if not that sounds off if she is giving these numbers.\n\nI agree she should pay and $400 is on the low side if she can afford 3k a month now. Put a hold on the moving in and figure out what else is going on.\n\nIs she wanting you to take care of her? Do she pay anything when you go out? If she doesn\u2019t and feels like $400 is fair then there is more issues than you can see.", "NAH, but I think the counter offer is fair and you should take it. I usually advise couples split household bills based on income, this is consistent with that.\n\nAnother way to go is just have her pay 1/2 utilities, since that's actually what she would be costing you. If she's not on the mortgage she shouldn't necessarily pay insurance or property tax", "NTA you don\u2019t even need her to move in. $400 is ridiculously low, I haven\u2019t paid that little since the early nineties renting and sharing a trashy apartment in podunk town in CO next to an interstate, while I bet you have a whole nice house. Definitely more than that, maybe twice as much", "NAH. You could pay for utilities and groceries equally (unless one of you is buying outrageously expensive food or mining Bitcoin). However, you should give her a break and split the cost of utilities more proportionally since you make more and it's the kind thing to do for someone you care about.

This person isn't a roommate. They're your partner. This should mean that you'll want to do things together socially - vacations, dinners, events. It should mean that you'll give one another gifts for special occasions. It should mean that you'll have to wear clothes and have hair/makeup etc. done for the events/dinners/vacations. It should mean that you'll want to have downtime to relax together and watch TV or make puzzles. All the things of daily life, you all share.   \n\n\niYou have exponentially more disposable income than she has, even if she pays no rent. She simply won't be able to afford all the things I listed above at the same level as you.

Is that what you want?   \n\n\nIf you want to have your current lifestyle but do it as if you're single because your partner can't afford to keep up, then why have a partner?   \n\n\nIf you want this person to be a part of your life in all the ways I listed above and you want to be able to do it at a level commensurate with your means, then you're going to have to subsidize her part of life. With that in mind, it seems silly to argue over 15k when you'll need to subsidize a whole lot more.  \n\n\nYou're not a bad person if you don't want to subsidize someone and you want to live a life you can afford to live on your high earnings.

There are two aspects to this.\n\nOne side costs of 2 people living is greater.. more electric, water , general utility costs ect.\n\nOn the other side, if you earn a proportional amount more than your partner splitting 50 50 can also also be an unfair burden to the other person.\n\nSplitting based on income can be much fairer but it can also be the most equalising way to split. It's unfair to the person earning more because they pay the \"penalty\" of being a higher earner.\n\nBut on the other side, a relationship should be both parties putting in effort and compromising. End of the day, if you have far more financial freedom being able to support your partner by helping them further with their financial freedom is an investment on them and the relationship, as well as helps equalise the balance of the relationship because otherwise their freedoms aren't as great as yours which can add tension to the relationship.\n\nI would recommend talking to them and trying to find a middle ground.
