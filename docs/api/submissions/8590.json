It is YOUR Birthday\n2. All relationships need attention not just the one with his teens\n3. You are entitled to want something or some time to yourself occasionally. Even non step parents have date nights and adult time.\n4. You have 3 children and the toddler needs to not spend her life only tagging along to teen appropriate things.\n5. In a healthy non blended family everything would not revolve around 2 of the members of that family to the exclusion of everyone else. It breeds entitlement.\n6. Has your husband got unresolved guilt around his divorce.", "Honestly I think you need to talk about how you feel about your husband working every weekend that the older kids aren\u2019t there. He does still have one kid there he is responsible for. If he didn\u2019t work every weekend they were away, I doubt you would even be in the position you are right now.", "Okay I was totally ready to rip into you. It\u2019s your birthday and you want to do something with a toddler that teens would not be interested in. That\u2019s totally acceptable and it\u2019s totally acceptable to do things with kids individually that does not involve other kids. So they\u2019re all getting alone time. \n\nPick the activities you want to do. Tell your husband this is what you want to do. If he wants to get his kids that\u2019s fine but make sure he mentions that the activities are more toddler based. If they agree they can\u2019t complain or be fighting. Make it an ultimatum. If they don\u2019t want to come then you\u2019ve given the option. \n\nExplain your toddler needs the same attention they get when they\u2019re in your home and since he works most weekends when he they aren\u2019t there he is missing out on having more dad dad time. \n\nNTA", "NTA but framing it as \u201cjust us\u201d does sound like you\u2019re excluding his older kids (they\u2019re not a part of \u201cus\u201d). \n\nPerhaps try saying that for your birthday you\u2019d rather deal with just one kid, not three, and also toddler goes to bed early - you expect hubby to give you his full attention and focus exclusively on you the rest of the evening ;-)", "NTA. As the only child to my mother and the third to my father I grew up in a similar household. I would watch my step siblings get my father's attention every other weekend while during our time I recived none of that special one on one or outtings. It is completely understandable in a split household to have activities as a single unit as well as ones that happen with everyone. Op's bday is a day that makes perfect sense to be a single unit day. That said it sounds like your celebration is planned for time that the step kiddos won't be there so there really is no harm. If your husband wants to celebrate together a second celebration is the way but he should be able to give you and your kiddo the same time he gives the family group, that's part of being a double parent...it's not a half time job.", "INFO: Would they want to be there for you on your birthday? If so, would it not be possible to tell these kids (who are apparently old enough) that you guys will be doing something that is toddler friendly, if they want to join? etc. Because if the kids would or wouldn't mind, would affect my vote", "NTA it's a matter of explaining that when the teens are there you guys modify everything to cater to them, but don't do anything for yourself or your toddler.\n\nYour husband may not understand this completely so you should come with examples of how you do all these teenager things, that aren't your, his, or the toddlers forte. \n\nAlso seriously take a day for yourself, don't be mom, or wife, or step mom, get you a day to just chill, if you don't eventually you'll burn out.", "May be unpopular, but I say NTA. Is your birthday and if you rarely do toddler centric activities, I think it\u2019s fair that you get to do that. Your child also deserves one in one time with their father. If you tried to exclude your step kids all the time, that\u2019s a problem, but there\u2019s a big age gap between the kids. It makes sense that the little one should get some time doing kid stuff that will straight up be uninteresting for the teens. If it\u2019s a big deal still can you compromise by doing something in the day with your toddler and then all going out to dinner at night?", "NTA the amount of people that CANNOT READ is amazing! You have every right to suggest it\u2019s just you 3 and doing something toddler friendly, if your husband has a problem with it tell him to go to work and do something with your toddler instead!!", "NTA I totally agree it\u2019s been centered around them for so long its overwhelming. Having to focus so much on other people is not fair at all! Y\u2019all should do baby things and you should do married couple things! Everything needs a balance and he better bond with his new baby! And how dare he not see he little shoved you in a corner. Working on the little time y\u2019all have alone not spending time with the little one and toddlers need stimulants!", "NTA. As long as you don\u2019t plan to disinvite the step kids in the future to other \u201cfamily\u201d things. \n\nIt sounds like they have a place in your family life and you do things all together all the time, which is commendable. So it is not wrong to plan something on a weekend you don\u2019t have them around for just the three of you.", "Nta, if you asked to go out for a romantic dinner with no kids, no one would say you're excluding them. Falling in love with someone with kids doesn't mean you have to want to be with their kids all the time. From what I gather, your birthday falls on a day where their mother has custody so why jank it up? Also I can guarantee that two teenagers aren't dying to go to a toddler friendly step-mother's birthday. Let them stay home.", "NTA. it sounds like you make a good effort with the stepkids and in fact have to watch your husband's children when he works. (which is really crappy of him to do).  It's not unreasonable for you to want to spend time with your child and your husband on your BD and he's a huge AH if he doesn't get it.", "NTA, so you never do anything with the toddler, because he works on the weekends when the older children are not there? And on the weekend that teh older children are there, all the attention goes to them?\nThe toddler is also entitled to outings appropriate to his age. And the right to attention from both parents.\nThat has nothing to do with hating the older kids.", "NTA.  The way you phrased it -  you want sub family time in addition to step family time; and activities focused on the toddler from time to time. Both are totally valid. \n\nYour hubs has done a good job of making sure the older kids are not being replaced by little one. That\u2019s a good goal.  Just need to find balance now", "NTA. We have a 1 and 6 year old together and for 6 year olds birthday we did something with only him.  We regularly have activities with 1 parent 1 kid, or 2 parents 1 kid. And of course with the 4 of us.", "NTA\n\nand if having something with them later when its their time to be with your family thats no worries.", "Have you ever tried talking to the older kiddos about the importance of doing things for the little one's development? Not all tweens or teens will respond positively, but some are sweet and might want to take the opportunity to be patient and learn.", "NTA. AT ALL.  It doesn't matter if they are stepkids, or fruit of your womb, having kids around all the time is a recipe for never getting time and opportunity to do what you want, which is a catalyst for resentment and depression.   ALL parents want a night away sometimes.  And the smart ones take it.\n\nYou all can celebrate with them on the following weekend.  Husband should be making this about you, not trying to compensate for his feelings of inadequacy as a parent or taking your day to shore up his relation with them.", "NTA. But you should be able to plan events that are age appropriate for your toddler. If it's not interesting for the teens, they can have their own free time. I see no reason that all kids of such disparate ages have to do everything together, even if they were all biologically shared.", "Definitely NTA. I feel like I could be writing this post myself. Personally I prefer a kid free celebration and then we do a dinner with all the kids. So many times my youngest daughter misses out on things bc my hubs won\u2019t let us make plans until we have waited for the older kids to be free or I have to wait for them to decline. Then sometimes they begrudgingly come because their dad forced it and then act bothered or complain the entire time. I love my step kiddos but teens just don\u2019t have the same interest as a little one.", "NTA.  Honestly,  your life is set up so you NEVER have the opportunity to have your husband and the child you share to yourself. It's only natural to want one day a year you can have that.\nPS- I take my comments back if your husband has insisted that your baby should spend the day with his ex on her birthday.", "NTA.  You both make sure that they are normally included.  If it's not their weekend and you want to focus on toddler activities, I honestly don't see an issue with it. Now, if it was part of a pattern where you regularly try to not include them, that would be a problem.", "NTA \n\nIt's a completely reasonable request. I don't understand the YTA's. I've had an evil stepmother and OP isn't it! \n\nIts your birthday x Yours.", "Unpopular but NTA, Just make sure that you ask your step children wether they would want to be with you, Or else they would feel left out, And if they don't wanna be there, So It's all good :)", "NTA. They\u2019re not scheduled to be with you guys that weekend anyways. So I don\u2019t understand why anyone would have an issue. Even if your husband thinks your the AH, he said you can do whatever you want. Compromise and tell him to ASK the teens if they want to come along to celebrate, but make it clear that it is UP TO YOU and if you want to choose an outing that is more focused towards the toddler than those are your birthday plans. Then tell the teens what the outing activity is, then let them decide. They\u2019ll likely say no anyways if they know the outing activity is \u201cnot cool enough\u201d.", "NTA. Your ask is totally reasonable, maybe you could even have a separate celebration with the stepkids on a different day. When my stepkids were at home there were times I would ask my DH if we could do something without the kids, because of the reasons you pointed out. As long as the kids are being treated equitably when they are with you, you don't have to do everything together all the time.", "NTA. Even if they were all your personal kids, trying to entertain a toddler and two teenagers is a lot. I seriously doubt that an adult's birthday is something they'd be devastated to miss, especially when they're getting fancy-fed as soon as they get back \ud83e\udd23", "NTA!!! It's YOUR birthday. Period.", "Very touchy topic.\n\n\nBirthdays generally create these issues. You want to do something because it is your special day...\n\nYour people want something else probably because it is a day of celebration.  \n\nSo NTA.", "NTA, it's important to have bonding time with the little one and if that doesn't happen often it can easily be accommodated now.\n\nI would sit down with SO and explain its not that you are excluding them or anything but just that you want some time with the little one and SO.", "NTA, he asked what you wanted to do and you wanted to spend time together with just him, your child and yourself. If he wasn\u2019t planning on something you actually wanted, then honestly why ask? You need to sit down and talk with him, that you love your step kids but he isn\u2019t spending enough time with his younger child doing things that the younger child will enjoy.", "NTA. It's entirely reasonable that your sub family unit spends time alone, just like he should be spending 1 on 1 time with your step kids. I would stress with examples the places you had in mind geared towards your youngest and plan a time for the entire family to celebrate your birthday together when it's the normal time with the step kids. Maybe y'all can do cake and a movie.", "NAH, sounds like husband may have misunderstood your intentions. Seems reasonable that the kids have different interests and would enjoy different types of day out. As a compromise could you have another day out next time you have the stepkids and do a 'second birthday'?\n\nThis sub often likes to point out that step parents aren't replacements for bio parents, so I don't see why this can't be the case here? Especially as it sounds like the stepkids have a good relationship with both bio parents still.", "I would normally say Y T A because leaving your stepkids out in favor of it being \"just our kid\" is what evil stepparents are made of, unless you're also equally taking each of them out, one at a time, so all kids get some time to have special outings alone with their parents/without other siblings.\n\nBut what saves you here is that you'd planned something for a time when the stepkids weren't supposed to be present. \n\nIt's reasonable to say, 'I'd rather celebrate with them when they come back on X day, and spend my birthday doing Y, which is a more toddler-focused activity'. \n\nI suspect this mostly comes down to how you worded it, since your husband is rightly protective of ALL his children, and wants to ensure your stepkids aren't excluded.\n\nFor that reason, NAH\n\nEdit to add- Why doesn't your husband just tell your step kids what the planned toddler-focused activity is, and ask them if they'd like to come? Chances are good most 13/14/15/16 year-olds would turn that down anyway. But they get to decide, and everyone wins. No one is excluded, and you get to do the activity you wanted with your toddler.", "NTA. It\u2019s your birthday. It wasn\u2019t their day to be there anyway. Celebrate when they are there for their time and have a cake. Enjoy your birthday with your hubby and toddler.", "NTA. It is completely normal to want some time away from your step kids. It sounds like your husband has been expecting you to put everything on hold when his kids are not with you. This is unreasonable and unfair. The step kids are old enough to recognize that just like their lives don\u2019t stop while they\u2019re at mom\u2019s, your lives don\u2019t stop either. Stop accepting your husbands need to put everything on hold unless all the kids are there. It\u2019s not fair to you and your little one.", "NTA.", "NTA.  Your birthday,  your plans (which are reasonable imo) should prevail.", "NTA", "I don\u2019t understand why people are saying YTA. They\u2019re not your kids for one. For two, you have a well established relationship with them, and already do family outings with them as it is, so who cares if you ask for one event with just you, husband, and toddler? It\u2019s not like you\u2019re doing something crazy and something the teens would enjoy. Toddler is too young to even really notice how \u201cboring\u201d or whatever the event is and doesn\u2019t need to be entertained as much as teens. I think it\u2019s unfair to have those assumptions made just because you want something for yourself. I don\u2019t think people realize how much sacrifice a mother makes to make a family happy, so godforbid **on your birthday** you want to do something you want. If the step kids want to be there for you on your birthday, make sure the father sets rules (no bickering, no droning/complaining, set boundaries\u2026 or they can go home)\n\nAs someone with a step parent majority of my life, if my step dad wanted to do something with just his kid, or his kid and my mom, me & my 2 little brothers wouldn\u2019t care because they\u2019re with us all the time and it\u2019s my step dads day, and he does so much for us in general, appreciated or not.\n\nImo, NTA\u2026 it\u2019s going to be your day and don\u2019t let anyone make you feel guilty for wanting things that make you happy.", "NTA it's perfectly acceptable to want a day to focus on the little one I honestly don't know how commenters are turning this into a step-kid bio-kid thing, the little one and bigger kids have completely different interests and are at different point in their lives and the older ones would have no interest in doing what the little one wants and based on this post and your comments you usually focus on the other two and try to make things fun for them and just taking the younger one with you. So NTA it's good to hangout with your kids separately sometimes and focus on what they want to do instead of trying to appeal to all of them", "NTA but... \n\nSorry but the \u201cjust us\u201d statement is where this whole thing falls apart.

Yeah, I get it, they're teens. But, do you know it, I have been a teen too (and I'm 22 so I haven't forgot it since). Either they go with you, and don't complain because this is a chance, not a punishment, or you alternate between a kid-oriented activity and a teen-oriented one and I guess they have a right to complain A BIT, or they just don't come when it's your toddler's turn to be entertained. But preventing the toddler (and you) of enjoying an activity is egoist.\n\n- Your husband, for thinking it's that big of a deal.

I've said I'd rather not to be honest and It's now a big deal and I'm apparently excluding and saying I don't like them (never have or would say that!). \n\nAITA for saying that on MY birthday, a day where the older ones were never meant to be with us anyway, I'd prefer it if my husband didn't try and change plans to bring along the older ones which means the focus of the day and what I wanted to do on my birthday will completely change?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It makes sense if they weren't supposed to be with you anyway, and you have more toddler focused activities planned. I don't know why people are saying y t a. As you say you're also going out for dinner with them a couple days later.", "NTA \n\nI think it's a reasonable ask to focus on the little one for a change. \n\nI don't think you're excluding the teens just planning things out in a way where everyone is happy and has a good time without getting bored or annoyed. \n\nAlthough I get why hubby would want them to be there for your birthday, he wants to share important milestones with them because you are all important to him. I know it's your birthday but it's an important occasion for him too. \n\nBtw how many days has he taken off work? Maybe you could all do something for your birthday day and then have another day to focus on the little one? Or he could take a day off on another day?", "You want a hassle free birthday. You aren\u2019t  being selfish. Talk with your husband.  The both of you sound like loving parents. Remind him that teenagers like to hang out with their friends more than their parents. They teens probably have plans because it\u2019s not the their weekend. Go have the birthday you wanted.

You have a pre-planned birthday dinner scheduled, because it is their scheduled weekend with their other parent.\n\nIt is nice of your husband to schedule a day off for your birthday. He asked you what you wanted to do. You told him. You didn't exclude your stepchildren. It isn't your weekend with them. You want to spend time with your husband and toddler on your birthday. Your husband is requesting you to call his former SO to request that his children be available to attend your birthday celebration. \n\nThis is what he wants. He has the day off. \"Why not spend the day with everyone?\" This is not for you. It is for him.\n\nYour stepchildren, and their other parent may have plans of their own.", "NTA.  You want to do things the younger one would like.  If every weekend you have the older children is about them, then the younger child never has any time with both parents that is about them (since dad works those weekends).", "NAH. \n\nHowever I will say it does come across kind of shitty to say you want to spend the day with YOUR child, but not his kids.  Your logic is totally sound, but its one of those things where the optics just aren't great. \n\nLike if you just wanted a date night, I'd think it would come across differently, but knowing that you want to hang out wiht a kid, just not those kids, can look bad.", "It's kind of hard to pass judgement here.  I'm leaning toward NTA because it's not unreasonable to want your birthday a certain way. However it's a little tricky with the way you've worded some of the detail about your teen step kids...particularly the feeling that you view them as separate family rather than all of you as one unit. You married into a family unit that already existed. You joined their family. The teens are not separate. You, and your shared child are an addition to the family. The way your describe things feels divisive and a little assholey. \n\n\n\nI think giving the teens a choice is fair and reasonable. have 2 teens at home myself, and they are asked often if they want to participate in something they may be less than thrilled by. They are also encouraged to be honest/not feel pressured by the wants of the adults asking (I often say, \"There is NO wrong answer.\"). They've opted not to participate numerous times. I think communication is important rather than the potential for them to feel purposely left out or unwelcome. \n\nFor this it would be simple enough to present the plans for the day and ask if they would like to participate. Example: \"We are planning this toddler focused activity to celebrate my birthday. I'd like to focus on toddler because we often tend to center our family activities based on you. If you'd like to join us,  you are welcomed, if not we will see you at dinner to celebrate all together.\" \n\nI cannot tell people enough how important communication is.", "NTA. Your birthday falls on a day that the stepkids are with their biomom. Wanting to focus one day on your toddler is perfectly fine. After all you are going out for dinner with the stepkids when you next have them as per the custody agreement.\n\nForcing the stepkids to go and do some toddler activity is pointless as they'll just get bored and end up fighting. Even asking them is needless as they're with their mom at that time. Your husband should respect that instead of trying to force them into everything, it is okay to take a day for yourself or your little one. That does not make you a monster, especially considering most of the time your family is doing more teen focused activities. Your husband should stop and listen to you before having a knee jerk reaction and acting like an AH.", "NTA \n\n>and has said we can do anything I want. \n\nClearly not a man of his word lol.\n\n>EDIT TO ADD: we are all going for a meal 2 days after my birthday which is when older ones will next be with us.\n\nThen wtf is he whinging about?", "So from a step daughter POV\n\nNo you are not wrong for wanting time with you just you three, I think your husband possibly misunderstood or thought it be a nice family day as in his mind your all family \n\nI don\u2019t think you hate them at all but from\nThe way you describe them wasn\u2019t nothing really positive about them.. sounds a bit like you resent the time spent with them as the baby doesn\u2019t get all the attention.

They could see you as actively trying to block them from their father, \nI certainly thought that with my step dad about my mum. \n\nTurns out he didn\u2019t understand teenage girls. Tbf does anyone understand the working minds of teenage girls.\n\nBut it certainly sounds like you would be more happier if they wasn\u2019t round as much.\n\nYou was never going to be a family of three because your not. You married a man with kids. It was never going to be just you and him and then your child \nYou see you and three person family and you want that but he doesn\u2019t see you as three member family and that\u2019s the difference", "NTA. Husband can talk to the older kids and tell them that it\u2019s your birthday, and it\u2019s your wish, and that they can survive a couple of hours at a toddler activity without whining.", "I\u2019m not going to call you an AH because you\u2019re clearly at the end of your tether with your husband catering to two spoiled brats (which is clearly what they are, despite you being gracious). He is always working, except when they\u2019re there making your house\u2019s atmosphere tense. He never makes any effort for you. His only free time goes on them.\n\nYes they\u2019re his kids but he shouldn\u2019t have remarried and had another if he couldn\u2019t give a fair amount of time to you and your son. He has 3 kids, not one. He\u2019s coparenting with the ex. On his weeks with the eldest, *you* parent your son. On his weeks without the eldest\u2026 he works, so *you* parent your son.\n\nAnd now, it\u2019s YOUR birthday. Astonishingly, he\u2019s taken the day off. You thought you\u2019d be getting some time. Selflessly, you wanted to put that towards your son finally getting some attention from his father. But no. It\u2019s just another excuse for a day out for THEM. He wants YOUR birthday to be about THEM.\n\nLook, they should be allowed to come if they want to - to an activity for YOUR son. For their younger brother. Your husband needs to step up and parent their spoiled asses. Making a toddler attend activities tailored to two entitled bickering brats is grotesque. Making your birthday about two mannerless ingrates while your child is once again pushed to the side is unacceptable. Never asking these teenagers to think of their little brother for once? Shockingly bad parenting. \n\nYour husband is favouring the horrible, distasteful individuals he\u2019s raising, and had no business marrying you. Let them come - to the activity of your choice. If he refuses then I think you\u2019re going to have to divorce him before the favouritism becomes apparent.\n\nNTA.", "I hope people say NTA.

Ima take another perspective on things and say the kids are old enough to the point that they can at least fake being interested for one day and help make your day feel special. The dad could just as easily talk to them about their behaviors problems and tell them to suck it up because your a hardworking mother who deserves to not feel like she\u2019s dragging her kids along even for the special days.  As for you, the mother and step mother, even if it wasn\u2019t the weekend the step kids were going to be there, your celebrating your birthday and those kids are now part of your life /family too now, so I understand why the husband invited them in the first place although I don\u2019t agree with his reaction. As I said, those kids need to suck it up and put a happy smile, not be on their phones bored and Atleast play with your baby and interact because you deserve to feel relaxed and not pressured to leave when it\u2019s your day.

I had idea- could you do the dinner with just the big kids and dad stays home with the younger? Treat it like a special time? Or a lunch the next weekend you have them? You can have time without toddlers - these kids are the age where you can have conversations and fun- and the big kids get a special day.", "Yeah the husband seems to suck as a father to the *toddler*!!", "I\u2019m literally saying that as long as she doesn\u2019t plan to plan all future family events on \u201cnot their weekend\u201d, she\u2019s perfectly fine to do this now.", "They are supposed to be at their mothers to boot, it is not even Dad's custody time.", "It is sad though that she feels she needs to use her own birthday to negotiate the toddler getting equal (or in this case just 1 day of) attention. If he was already getting it, she'd probably want her birthday to be special for her and not the toddler. It says a lot about what this woman will sacrifice in order to advocate or give to her kiddo instead. NTA.", "lol if i got invited to a dinner when i was like 14-15 year old and if i found out that some toddler will also be there, I would stick to be in my bed and play some video games \ud83d\ude02 but now i don't care much because i now love to play with Toddlers", "Yes, I read that, as per the post, they don't have the kids that weekend. I read the whole thing. But thank you for summarizing in case I didn't get it.", "There are two families because for 14 days a week her step children are with their mother and on those occasions they are a family of 3. For 14 days a week the step children are with them then they are a family of 5. What they should live their lives like the step TEEN children are always there and never give the toddler any age appropriate time....can anyone say emotional and developmental neglect. \n\nThe Teens are supposed to be with their mother on OP's birthday she would like to do something that is age appropriate for their toddler as a one off. The only AHish bit seems to be that the toddler is not be recognised enough as having needs by the father and OP needs to stand up about that more.", "Are.......are you seriously telling her to use sex to manipulate her husband into getting what she wants instead of just being upfront about it?", "You have such a skewed way of looking at this situation. \nIt\u2019s not even on the weekend the kids are suppose to be with the father. So that means the teens have to spend two weekends with them and why isn\u2019t it on them to decide if they even want too or not? \n\nI also don\u2019t think you understand that people just need breaks from teenagers. OP isn\u2019t trying to banish them, OP just wants to focus, for once, on the toddler, rather than two teenagers that bicker and fight, and complain and drone when they\u2019re bored. It seems like regardless of whatever event they go too, the teens find a way to make some part of it exhausting. So why can\u2019t OP just have One single day where she doesn\u2019t have to deal with it? \n\nI also feel like you never been in a situation like this. I was a step mom at one point, and it\u2019s exhausting to handle other peoples kids because godforbid you do something they don\u2019t like and they run off and make you look like a bad person. I also have a step dad, where I know he would rather just it be him, his kid and my mom or the two of them (him and his kid), and no one cared because our step dad was with us all the time.\n\nI\u2019m so tired of hearing \u201cyou got with someone with kids. It\u2019s a package deal\u201d yes, I agree but sometimes, you need to get over it and realize others need happiness too.", "They are part of the family. Why on earth wouldn't they be included in family activities? \n\nAnd for the record, including them doesn't mean they always have to go. But they should certainly be invited, unless they are also afforded equal opportunities to go out with their parents without the other siblings present. Otherwise, that would be excluding them and treating them differently, which is a pretty crappy parenting technique. Kids should be treated fairly and equitably. \n\nAnd no one said that OP and her husband shouldn't have child-free time, or that the toddler should always be ignored in favor of the teens either. Just the opposite, in fact; OP detailed instances of doing toddler-focused activities where the teens got bored. And that's just part of being a sibling. When we were growing up, sometimes I got bored doing stuff with our family that was geared toward my youngest siblings. Sometimes they got bored when the activity was something I'd asked for. When I was old enough to stay home, sometimes I said I'd rather do that. But I was never unwanted or uninvited. Nor were they.", "How many countless AITA do we see where an evil stepparent is treating the stepkids differently from \"their\" kids?? \n\nIt's not unreasonable for OP's husband to be protective of all his kids, and worry about some of them being excluded. \n\nIt's also not unreasonable for OP to get to do what she wants on her birthday. \n\nHence the NAH.\n\nBecause their big disagreement almost certainly comes down to poor communication and how they talk about ensuring both of those things are handled.", "I came so far down to find a post I could agree with. This is one of those things where OP comes off as technically right because it wasn't supposed to be their weekend with the teens, and there is nothing indicating that they particularly want to come. \n\nBut your wording is perfect. It comes off horrible that the special treat she wants for her birthday is for her step kids not to be there. I don't blame the husband for being hurt by that, and I'm sure the step kids would be too if they found out.", "Oh I don\u2019t think OP is wrong however if she says hey \u201call I want for my birthday is to spend the day with just you & toddler doing fun kid stuff\u201d I can see where Dad might get the wrong idea. Honestly, I don\u2019t think this would have been an issue if she didn\u2019t try to over explain why she didn\u2019t want older kids to go along. They aren\u2019t meant to be there so just plan your day. Don\u2019t make it about the kids.", "Yes that\u2019s why I said it should not be an issue. However, it obviously is with her husband.", "My husband & I have 4 kids. If we are going out to celebrate a birthday everyone goes. We would not celebrate Mom or Dad\u2019s birthday with just 1 kid. However, we often divided to conquer when our kids were little (now 25, 25, 27, 29). The only thing that makes this an issue is because what OP wants for her birthday is 2 less kids.", "Did I say any of that no\n\nI was offering a different view on it \n\nI never said she was blocking them again a different view on how it can be locked at..\n\nDo you know her, are you going this hard on everyone", "Yes but this is a family event, a birthday. Not some random day of the week that you two can spend time with your toddler and also, if you had other kids with him you\u2019re saying you would exclude them as well in your birthday? I very highly doubt that maam.", "I guess if you're saying this then I didn't explain my point clearly, because I agree with you. \n\nWanting to focus on one child is great. Well, providing it's not the only child they focus on of course. Wanting the day to be about you is great too. It's your right, as it's your birthday. No problem here.\n\nMy problem lays in where OP wants, out of all days, her birthday to be stepkids free. Focusing on the toddler is an excuse. Because they can choose to focus on him every other day. Even if OP said it like this, what she really means is \"stepkids free\". And I find it cruel. Maybe I'm wrong, maybe I'm not. \n\nBut if my biological parents were working together for me to attend my stepmother's birthday, and she was like \"don't bother, I don't want them here, I prefer being with my real family\", I'd be hurt. And that's why OP is TA (not saying others aren't) : she knew she would have stepkids, marrying her husband. She knew they would become part of her family.", "But it\u2019s not any weekend, it\u2019s your birthday. It\u2019s a special occasion that you share with your family. But it looks like you only want to share it with a part of it.", "Then NTA and husband needs to leave things be", "Not on family events like my birthday honey. That\u2019s a separate day.", " It sounds like he needs to put more effort in spending time with you and youngest alone.", "As a kid of a dead beat dad, I really appreciate how he makes sure he\u2019s around for his kids that he only gets 50% of the time. His wife and toddler are there 100% of the time. So I think him working those weekends (especially if some weekends are a requirement) makes sense. It\u2019s way better than him having to work on weekends all 3 kids are home leaving OP to care for them all.", "The bigs have no interest in playing with their toddler half sibling. \n\n> and they are at an age now where they don't want to do anything considered lame / boring and will complain the whole time if so.", "Honestly I wonder if the older kids have even expressed any desire to go, or if he\u2019s pushing the issue just because he feels like he shouldn\u2019t exclude them. I don\u2019t know many teenagers who would be sad at not spending their weekend out with their stepmom and toddler younger sibling.", "Ive dated peoole with kids 2 times now. Both times if you ever tried to set up plans dmthat didnt invilve the kids they look at you like a villan.(after the 6ish month inital period of dating)", "It is not \u201cexcluding them from a birthday\u201d it is not changing the custody agreement to take teens to a toddler activity that they would not enjoy, the \u201cfamily celebration\u201d will be in 2 days on the scheduled visit", "Wait - so if your husband wanted to take the littles to a children\u2019s activity without the big ones hanging around and behind annoyed at having sit around the puppet show or children\u2019s museum you would dislike that? What if he wanted to take the older ones to something inappropriate for the littles like a horror movie? You are really setting up something bad here. In non-blended families parents take different kids to different things. This is a you issue that really needs some work. You need to realize that it is okay for different kids to get activities with parents and each other.", "Yeah but it\u2019s an special event. Probably if their mother birthday was during a weekend when the kids were with their father, he\u2019ll allow them to go with their mother.", "It is impossible to have *\"14 days a week\"*!! (there are 7 days in a week, *always*!) LOL!!\ud83d\ude06", "Purposely excluding the step-kids in this way has to be a tough pill for Dad to swallow. I totally get it but.... think OP probably should\u2019ve thought this plan out better.", "I think she explained for background information mostly  for us. She wanted to do just that and plan a day with her husband and toddler, but her husband immediately said that he would call to ask the other kids to join, and that's not what she wanted. She tried to do exactly what you said, and her husband got upset. Hence, her posting here.", "Idk if that edit was there when I commented - but I will retract my YTA.\n\nThe family dinner is the family b-day plan and the actual b-day activities are not super relevant. As long as there\u2019s an opportunity for the entire family to celebrate together, then she should be good.", "I don't think my birthday is of any real interest to two teenagers.", "Yeah that was a weird way to interpret him working weekends.\n\nHe's making an effort with all his kids.", "Yeah it\u2019s actually not inherently unfair that he works the weekends his older kids aren\u2019t there so that he can be present when they are there. The toddler doesn\u2019t get weekends alone with the husband, but the older kids don\u2019t get a weekend alone with their dad either. There\u2019s no unfairness there. \n\nBiggest problem here is the toddler AND the teenagers should be getting individualized attention from dad/both parents and that isn\u2019t happening here.\n\nOP isn\u2019t the asshole for her request in the slightest but the work schedule isn\u2019t the biggest problem here.", "I think this is different - this is a marriage and there are younger kids here. And there is a celebration for the big ones too.", "No I\u2019m not saying that but she is talking about one specific event. The wider issues are a separate conversation and not the point of the post. As I said, I am not saying she is wrong, I am just offering the perspective of the non step parent in case it\u2019s helpful in her conversations with her husband to try and resolve it.", "Yeah I totally understand that, and as I said I don\u2019t think she is wrong to feel how she feels. I was just explaining why her husband would see it differently. Surely the point of posting is to get different perspectives.", "FWIW, this is a large part of what makes this NTA for me. I\u2019d be much more torn if you were actively sending them away, but given that\u2019s not the case, I\u2019m a little baffled by your husband\u2019s insistence at their inclusion here.", "Yes I totally understand that (although unfortunately part of being the youngest I guess) but I\u2019m saying that your husband will not have thought about it like that as you in your head are usually thinking 1+2 but he\u2019s always thinking 3. Hopefully by talking it through he will see that where you are coming from. I hope you have a nice birthday!", "Imo OP is saying all I want is 2 less kids for my birthday. So I can see where that will be a problem for Dad. They are a family & it\u2019s a birthday celebration. Excluding kids from family celebrations is just bad timing. It\u2019s just the birthday thing for me. OP gets to do what she wants it\u2019s her bday & she doesn\u2019t want to deal with 2 teenagers. Totally get it. Dad doesn\u2019t feel great about excluding other kids from family outing for a birthday celebration. Totally get it.", "So you don\u2019t think your child should get to know their siblings and vice versa? A lot of people will tell you you\u2019re NTA on here but if you knew you were 1000% in the right, you wouldn\u2019t be here. You know as a mother, as someone who married someone with kids, you\u2019re telling ME you wouldn\u2019t be pissed if your husband ,god forbids, divorces you and doesn\u2019t want to include your kid in his life and every special event, you\u2019d be like oh yeah that new wife is totally not the asshole?? Biiiiittchhhhh you got me fucked up with that lie. I know damn well you would not be having that shit despite what custody agreement you have. Those are kids he raised too !!Girrrrrlll I am telling youuuuu!!! You will have a way easier/better marriage if you accept the truth that you have 3 kids. If the case was really about bonding with the toddler and you were so about this one on one time, your ass would have planned it LONG AGO. You would have told your husband to spend time with the baby LONG ago. You are seeing an opportunity to exclude the step kids and girl everyone on here may not see it, but those saying you\u2019re the AH do. The only one who isn\u2019t seeing what your actions may lead up to is YOU and you\u2019re trying to justify it and feel better with strangers on the internet. Word of advice, talk to your MAN. That\u2019s the problem, you are bringing others into your marriage instead of taking out your feelings to yourself and to your man. And you aren\u2019t being honest with yourself. Your tone even saying \u201ctheir attitude\u201d be real bitch! We know teenagers SUCK!! Be honest instead of having this charade of \u201coh it\u2019s for the baby\u201d girl no it ain\u2019t, it\u2019s cause teens are jerks and a buzz kill \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "They aren\u2019t \u201ctwo teenagers\u201d. They\u2019re your kids.", "Have you asked them?", "True! I\u2019m guessing a lot of it has to do with age difference like OP was describing. Which is definitely hard to navigate. But I think the events should be more evenly divided and the older kids can survive a couple boring hour every couple weeks or so.", "Yeah but you said \n\n> If my husband wanted to exclude my older kids from a birthday etc this would be very upsetting for me and for them. \n\nThat\u2019s the point tho it\u2019s not excluding anyone the actual family celebration is 2 days after when the kids are scheduled to be there, day of they\u2019re not meant to be there so OP wants to do toddler centric activity\u2019s which they will not enjoy, do you just never do an activity with just your 1/6yo without the teens? Doubtful because what is appealing/for the 1/6yo is not appealing/for teens.\nIf an event is not toddler appropriate should the teens not get to do it too because the toddler can\u2019t? because that\u2019s \u201cexcluding\u201d when not everyone is involved in everything", "Who happen to be two teenagers.", "i've been reading these comments - i really think you need to question all of this. your husband never wants a weekend with you and your child together, ever. he makes sure he's out of the house on purpose. was your child an oopsie or planned? because it feels like he isn't bonded to your kid and doesn't want to be around them with just you, only when his older kids are there also. \n\nand INFO: on those weekends where he is actually home, is he involved with any of the childcare? or is that all on you? is he focused on the teens, the teens and toddler, or is he checked out of all of it?", "I think a way forward is to discuss how to have more opportunities where you and your husband spend quality time with your little on but perhaps a major event like your birthday is not the best day to make it happen?", "But it's not really a birthday celebration? From the sounds of it they will not really be acknowledging OP birthday during this outing, it will be solely focused on the kiddo. They are doing an actual birthday celebration with the step kids when they come back from their moms. \n\nAnd I can almost guarantee that if asked, the teens would chose not to go because they will be bored out of their skulls. These kids will not care that they missed out on a toddler activity, and they will likely be grateful they didn't have to attend."]}
