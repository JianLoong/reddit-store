We do lots of family days out on the weekends my stepkids are with us. \n\nAnyway, this year he booked my birthday off work which was a nice surprise and has said we can do anything I want. \n\nIt might sound a little odd but honestly I'd just really like to take our toddler somewhere a bit focused on them and have a day out me, husband and our toddler as it's very rare they get to do something focused on their age group with both of us and our full attention. \n\nI have a really good relationship with my stepchildren but when we go out, we tend to ensure its  older kid focused as they get bored easily and they are at an age now where they don't want to do anything considered lame / boring and will complain the whole time if so. They also struggle a lot with fighting between the two of them so most days out there are at least one or two fall outs. It's life with teens that's fine. \n\nBut anyway, on my birthday I'd really just like to go somewhere the 3 of us where we can focus on the little one and not have to worry about older ones getting bored/ arguing / wanting to go home etc.. and seen as they weren't supposed to be with us this weekend anyway I thought it would be a good opportunity to do that. \n\nAnyway... Husband has now suggested he ask his ex if we can have older ones that day so they can come with us. I've said I'd rather not to be honest and It's now a big deal and I'm apparently excluding and saying I don't like them (never have or would say that!). \n\nAITA for saying that on MY birthday, a day where the older ones were never meant to be with us anyway, I'd prefer it if my husband didn't try and change plans to bring along the older ones which means the focus of the day and what I wanted to do on my birthday will completely change?\n\nEDIT TO ADD: we are all going for a meal 2 days after my birthday which is when older ones will next be with us.", "created_utc": 1674999683, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10o7wbn/aita_for_asking_my_husband_not_to_invite_stepkids/", "score": 2712, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It is YOUR Birthday\n2. All relationships need attention not just the one with his teens\n3. You are entitled to want something or some time to yourself occasionally. Even non step parents have date nights and adult time.\n4. You have 3 children and the toddler needs to not spend her life only tagging along to teen appropriate things.\n5.

He does still have one kid there he is responsible for. If he didn\u2019t work every weekend they were away, I doubt you would even be in the position you are right now.", "Okay I was totally ready to rip into you. It\u2019s your birthday and you want to do something with a toddler that teens would not be interested in. That\u2019s totally acceptable and it\u2019s totally acceptable to do things with kids individually that does not involve other kids. So they\u2019re all getting alone time. \n\nPick the activities you want to do. Tell your husband this is what you want to do. If he wants to get his kids that\u2019s fine but make sure he mentions that the activities are more toddler based. If they agree they can\u2019t complain or be fighting. Make it an ultimatum. If they don\u2019t want to come then you\u2019ve given the option. \n\nExplain your toddler needs the same attention they get when they\u2019re in your home and since he works most weekends when he they aren\u2019t there he is missing out on having more dad dad time. \n\nNTA", "NTA but framing it as \u201cjust us\u201d does sound like you\u2019re excluding his older kids (they\u2019re not a part of \u201cus\u201d). \n\nPerhaps try saying that for your birthday you\u2019d rather deal with just one kid, not three, and also toddler goes to bed early - you expect hubby to give you his full attention and focus exclusively on you the rest of the evening ;-)", "NTA. As the only child to my mother and the third to my father I grew up in a similar household. I would watch my step siblings get my father's attention every other weekend while during our time I recived none of that special one on one or outtings. It is completely understandable in a split household to have activities as a single unit as well as ones that happen with everyone. Op's bday is a day that makes perfect sense to be a single unit day. That said it sounds like your celebration is planned for time that the step kiddos won't be there so there really is no harm. If your husband wants to celebrate together a second celebration is the way but he should be able to give you and your kiddo the same time he gives the family group, that's part of being a double parent...it's not a half time job.", "INFO: Would they want to be there for you on your birthday? If so, would it not be possible to tell these kids (who are apparently old enough) that you guys will be doing something that is toddler friendly, if they want to join? etc. Because if the kids would or wouldn't mind, would affect my vote", "NTA it's a matter of explaining that when the teens are there you guys modify everything to cater to them, but don't do anything for yourself or your toddler.\n\nYour husband may not understand this completely so you should come with examples of how you do all these teenager things, that aren't your, his, or the toddlers forte. \n\nAlso seriously take a day for yourself, don't be mom, or wife, or step mom, get you a day to just chill, if you don't eventually you'll burn out.", "May be unpopular, but I say NTA. Is your birthday and if you rarely do toddler centric activities, I think it\u2019s fair that you get to do that. Your child also deserves one in one time with their father. If you tried to exclude your step kids all the time, that\u2019s a problem, but there\u2019s a big age gap between the kids. It makes sense that the little one should get some time doing kid stuff that will straight up be uninteresting for the teens. If it\u2019s a big deal still can you compromise by doing something in the day with your toddler and then all going out to dinner at night?", "NTA the amount of people that CANNOT READ is amazing! You have every right to suggest it\u2019s just you 3 and doing something toddler friendly, if your husband has a problem with it tell him to go to work and do something with your toddler instead!!", "NTA I totally agree it\u2019s been centered around them for so long its overwhelming. Having to focus so much on other people is not fair at all! Y\u2019all should do baby things and you should do married couple things! Everything needs a balance and he better bond with his new baby! And how dare he not see he little shoved you in a corner. Working on the little time y\u2019all have alone not spending time with the little one and toddlers need stimulants!", "NTA. As long as you don\u2019t plan to disinvite the step kids in the future to other \u201cfamily\u201d things. \n\nIt sounds like they have a place in your family life and you do things all together all the time, which is commendable. So it is not wrong to plan something on a weekend you don\u2019t have them around for just the three of you.", "Nta, if you asked to go out for a romantic dinner with no kids, no one would say you're excluding them. Falling in love with someone with kids doesn't mean you have to want to be with their kids all the time. From what I gather, your birthday falls on a day where their mother has custody so why jank it up? Also I can guarantee that two teenagers aren't dying to go to a toddler friendly step-mother's birthday. Let them stay home.", "NTA. it sounds like you make a good effort with the stepkids and in fact have to watch your husband's children when he works. (which is really crappy of him to do).  It's not unreasonable for you to want to spend time with your child and your husband on your BD and he's a huge AH if he doesn't get it.", "NTA, so you never do anything with the toddler, because he works on the weekends when the older children are not there? And on the weekend that teh older children are there, all the attention goes to them?\nThe toddler is also entitled to outings appropriate to his age. And the right to attention from both parents.\nThat has nothing to do with hating the older kids.", "NTA.  The way you phrased it -  you want sub family time in addition to step family time; and activities focused on the toddler from time to time. Both are totally valid. \n\nYour hubs has done a good job of making sure the older kids are not being replaced by little one. That\u2019s a good goal.  Just need to find balance now", "NTA. We have a 1 and 6 year old together and for 6 year olds birthday we did something with only him.  We regularly have activities with 1 parent 1 kid, or 2 parents 1 kid. And of course with the 4 of us.", "NTA\n\nand if having something with them later when its their time to be with your family thats no worries.", "Have you ever tried talking to the older kiddos about the importance of doing things for the little one's development? Not all tweens or teens will respond positively, but some are sweet and might want to take the opportunity to be patient and learn.", "NTA. AT ALL.  It doesn't matter if they are stepkids, or fruit of your womb, having kids around all the time is a recipe for never getting time and opportunity to do what you want, which is a catalyst for resentment and depression.   ALL parents want a night away sometimes.  And the smart ones take it.\n\nYou all can celebrate with them on the following weekend.  Husband should be making this about you, not trying to compensate for his feelings of inadequacy as a parent or taking your day to shore up his relation with them.", "NTA. But you should be able to plan events that are age appropriate for your toddler. If it's not interesting for the teens, they can have their own free time. I see no reason that all kids of such disparate ages have to do everything together, even if they were all biologically shared.", "Definitely NTA. I feel like I could be writing this post myself. Personally I prefer a kid free celebration and then we do a dinner with all the kids. So many times my youngest daughter misses out on things bc my hubs won\u2019t let us make plans until we have waited for the older kids to be free or I have to wait for them to decline. Then sometimes they begrudgingly come because their dad forced it and then act bothered or complain the entire time. I love my step kiddos but teens just don\u2019t have the same interest as a little one.", "NTA.  Honestly,  your life is set up so you NEVER have the opportunity to have your husband and the child you share to yourself. It's only natural to want one day a year you can have that.\nPS- I take my comments back if your husband has insisted that your baby should spend the day with his ex on her birthday.", "NTA.  You both make sure that they are normally included.  If it's not their weekend and you want to focus on toddler activities, I honestly don't see an issue with it. Now, if it was part of a pattern where you regularly try to not include them, that would be a problem.", "NTA \n\nIt's a completely reasonable request. I don't understand the YTA's. I've had an evil stepmother and OP isn't it! \n\nIts your birthday x Yours.", "Unpopular but NTA, Just make sure that you ask your step children wether they would want to be with you, Or else they would feel left out, And if they don't wanna be there, So It's all good :)", "NTA. They\u2019re not scheduled to be with you guys that weekend anyways. So I don\u2019t understand why anyone would have an issue. Even if your husband thinks your the AH, he said you can do whatever you want. Compromise and tell him to ASK the teens if they want to come along to celebrate, but make it clear that it is UP TO YOU and if you want to choose an outing that is more focused towards the toddler than those are your birthday plans. Then tell the teens what the outing activity is, then let them decide. They\u2019ll likely say no anyways if they know the outing activity is \u201cnot cool enough\u201d.", "NTA. Your ask is totally reasonable, maybe you could even have a separate celebration with the stepkids on a different day. When my stepkids were at home there were times I would ask my DH if we could do something without the kids, because of the reasons you pointed out. As long as the kids are being treated equitably when they are with you, you don't have to do everything together all the time.", "NTA. Even if they were all your personal kids, trying to entertain a toddler and two teenagers is a lot. I seriously doubt that an adult's birthday is something they'd be devastated to miss, especially when they're getting fancy-fed as soon as they get back \ud83e\udd23", "NTA!!! It's YOUR birthday. Period.", "Very touchy topic.\n\n\nBirthdays generally create these issues. You want to do something because it is your special day...\n\nYour people want something else probably because it is a day of celebration.  \n\nSo NTA.", "NTA, it's important to have bonding time with the little one and if that doesn't happen often it can easily be accommodated now.\n\nI would sit down with SO and explain its not that you are excluding them or anything but just that you want some time with the little one and SO.", "NTA, he asked what you wanted to do and you wanted to spend time together with just him, your child and yourself. If he wasn\u2019t planning on something you actually wanted, then honestly why ask? You need to sit down and talk with him, that you love your step kids but he isn\u2019t spending enough time with his younger child doing things that the younger child will enjoy.", "NTA. It's entirely reasonable that your sub family unit spends time alone, just like he should be spending 1 on 1 time with your step kids. I would stress with examples the places you had in mind geared towards your youngest and plan a time for the entire family to celebrate your birthday together when it's the normal time with the step kids. Maybe y'all can do cake and a movie.", "NAH, sounds like husband may have misunderstood your intentions. Seems reasonable that the kids have different interests and would enjoy different types of day out. As a compromise could you have another day out next time you have the stepkids and do a 'second birthday'?\n\nThis sub often likes to point out that step parents aren't replacements for bio parents, so I don't see why this can't be the case here? Especially as it sounds like the stepkids have a good relationship with both bio parents still.", "I would normally say Y T A because leaving your stepkids out in favor of it being \"just our kid\" is what evil stepparents are made of, unless you're also equally taking each of them out, one at a time, so all kids get some time to have special outings alone with their parents/without other siblings.\n\nBut what saves you here is that you'd planned something for a time when the stepkids weren't supposed to be present. \n\nIt's reasonable to say, 'I'd rather celebrate with them when they come back on X day, and spend my birthday doing Y, which is a more toddler-focused activity'. \n\nI suspect this mostly comes down to how you worded it, since your husband is rightly protective of ALL his children, and wants to ensure your stepkids aren't excluded.\n\nFor that reason, NAH\n\nEdit to add- Why doesn't your husband just tell your step kids what the planned toddler-focused activity is, and ask them if they'd like to come? Chances are good most 13/14/15/16 year-olds would turn that down anyway. But they get to decide, and everyone wins. No one is excluded, and you get to do the activity you wanted with your toddler.", "NTA. It\u2019s your birthday. It wasn\u2019t their day to be there anyway. Celebrate when they are there for their time and have a cake. Enjoy your birthday with your hubby and toddler.", "NTA. It is completely normal to want some time away from your step kids. It sounds like your husband has been expecting you to put everything on hold when his kids are not with you. This is unreasonable and unfair. The step kids are old enough to recognize that just like their lives don\u2019t stop while they\u2019re at mom\u2019s, your lives don\u2019t stop either. Stop accepting your husbands need to put everything on hold unless all the kids are there. It\u2019s not fair to you and your little one.", "NTA.", "NTA.  Your birthday,  your plans (which are reasonable imo) should prevail.", "NTA", "I don\u2019t understand why people are saying YTA. They\u2019re not your kids for one. For two, you have a well established relationship with them, and already do family outings with them as it is, so who cares if you ask for one event with just you, husband, and toddler? It\u2019s not like you\u2019re doing something crazy and something the teens would enjoy. Toddler is too young to even really notice how \u201cboring\u201d or whatever the event is and doesn\u2019t need to be entertained as much as teens. I think it\u2019s unfair to have those assumptions made just because you want something for yourself. I don\u2019t think people realize how much sacrifice a mother makes to make a family happy, so godforbid **on your birthday** you want to do something you want. If the step kids want to be there for you on your birthday, make sure the father sets rules (no bickering, no droning/complaining, set boundaries\u2026 or they can go home)\n\nAs someone with a step parent majority of my life, if my step dad wanted to do something with just his kid, or his kid and my mom, me & my 2 little brothers wouldn\u2019t care because they\u2019re with us all the time and it\u2019s my step dads day, and he does so much for us in general, appreciated or not.\n\nImo, NTA\u2026 it\u2019s going to be your day and don\u2019t let anyone make you feel guilty for wanting things that make you happy.", "NTA it's perfectly acceptable to want a day to focus on the little one I honestly don't know how commenters are turning this into a step-kid bio-kid thing, the little one and bigger kids have completely different interests and are at different point in their lives and the older ones would have no interest in doing what the little one wants and based on this post and your comments you usually focus on the other two and try to make things fun for them and just taking the younger one with you.

Yeah, I get it, they're teens. But, do you know it, I have been a teen too (and I'm 22 so I haven't forgot it since). Either they go with you, and don't complain because this is a chance, not a punishment, or you alternate between a kid-oriented activity and a teen-oriented one and I guess they have a right to complain A BIT, or they just don't come when it's your toddler's turn to be entertained. But preventing the toddler (and you) of enjoying an activity is egoist.\n\n- Your husband, for thinking it's that big of a deal. If the kids were all biological siblings, it wouldn't seem out of the ordinary to focus on one or the other sometimes, because one-on-one time is very important IMO. \n\n- You, because you know deep down it's an excuse not to see the stepkids.

As you say you're also going out for dinner with them a couple days later.", "NTA \n\nI think it's a reasonable ask to focus on the little one for a change. \n\nI don't think you're excluding the teens just planning things out in a way where everyone is happy and has a good time without getting bored or annoyed. \n\nAlthough I get why hubby would want them to be there for your birthday, he wants to share important milestones with them because you are all important to him. I know it's your birthday but it's an important occasion for him too. \n\nBtw how many days has he taken off work? Maybe you could all do something for your birthday day and then have another day to focus on the little one? Or he could take a day off on another day?", "You want a hassle free birthday. You aren\u2019t  being selfish. Talk with your husband.  The both of you sound like loving parents. Remind him that teenagers like to hang out with their friends more than their parents. They teens probably have plans because it\u2019s not the their weekend. Go have the birthday you wanted. NTA.", "NTA\nI came into this expecting to lean in the other direction to be honest.\nIf it's not even your weekend with them, I think it's fair to wait until you have them to celebrate with a nice lunch, dinner, whatever you all had in mind.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nYou aren't rejecting yout stepchildren. You have a pre-planned birthday dinner scheduled, because it is their scheduled weekend with their other parent.\n\nIt is nice of your husband to schedule a day off for your birthday. He asked you what you wanted to do. You told him. You didn't exclude your stepchildren. It isn't your weekend with them. You want to spend time with your husband and toddler on your birthday. Your husband is requesting you to call his former SO to request that his children be available to attend your birthday celebration. \n\nThis is what he wants. He has the day off. \"Why not spend the day with everyone?\" This is not for you. It is for him.\n\nYour stepchildren, and their other parent may have plans of their own.", "NTA.  You want to do things the younger one would like.  If every weekend you have the older children is about them, then the younger child never has any time with both parents that is about them (since dad works those weekends).", "NAH. \n\nHowever I will say it does come across kind of shitty to say you want to spend the day with YOUR child, but not his kids.  Your logic is totally sound, but its one of those things where the optics just aren't great. \n\nLike if you just wanted a date night, I'd think it would come across differently, but knowing that you want to hang out wiht a kid, just not those kids, can look bad.", "It's kind of hard to pass judgement here.  I'm leaning toward NTA because it's not unreasonable to want your birthday a certain way. However it's a little tricky with the way you've worded some of the detail about your teen step kids...particularly the feeling that you view them as separate family rather than all of you as one unit. You married into a family unit that already existed. You joined their family. The teens are not separate. You, and your shared child are an addition to the family. The way your describe things feels divisive and a little assholey. \n\n\n\nI think giving the teens a choice is fair and reasonable. have 2 teens at home myself, and they are asked often if they want to participate in something they may be less than thrilled by. They are also encouraged to be honest/not feel pressured by the wants of the adults asking (I often say, \"There is NO wrong answer.\"). They've opted not to participate numerous times. I think communication is important rather than the potential for them to feel purposely left out or unwelcome. \n\nFor this it would be simple enough to present the plans for the day and ask if they would like to participate. Example: \"We are planning this toddler focused activity to celebrate my birthday. I'd like to focus on toddler because we often tend to center our family activities based on you. If you'd like to join us,  you are welcomed, if not we will see you at dinner to celebrate all together.\" \n\nI cannot tell people enough how important communication is.", "NTA. Your birthday falls on a day that the stepkids are with their biomom. Wanting to focus one day on your toddler is perfectly fine. After all you are going out for dinner with the stepkids when you next have them as per the custody agreement.\n\nForcing the stepkids to go and do some toddler activity is pointless as they'll just get bored and end up fighting. Even asking them is needless as they're with their mom at that time. Your husband should respect that instead of trying to force them into everything, it is okay to take a day for yourself or your little one. That does not make you a monster, especially considering most of the time your family is doing more teen focused activities. Your husband should stop and listen to you before having a knee jerk reaction and acting like an AH.", "NTA \n\n>and has said we can do anything I want. \n\nClearly not a man of his word lol.\n\n>EDIT TO ADD: we are all going for a meal 2 days after my birthday which is when older ones will next be with us.\n\nThen wtf is he whinging about?", "So from a step daughter POV\n\nNo you are not wrong for wanting time with you just you three, I think your husband possibly misunderstood or thought it be a nice family day as in his mind your all family \n\nI don\u2019t think you hate them at all but from\nThe way you describe them wasn\u2019t nothing really positive about them.. sounds a bit like you resent the time spent with them as the baby doesn\u2019t get all the attention. Again that\u2019s how I\u2019m reading it and can be wrong.\n\n\nJust remember they are teens maybe as them say hey it\u2019s my birthday this weekend we going so so place it\u2019s for the baby would you like to come. And if like you say they won\u2019t want to they will say.\n\nBut what if they say yes they want to and spend time with you as a family.\n\nDoesn\u2019t matter that they do normal teenage moaning and fighting. They could see you as actively trying to block them from their father, \nI certainly thought that with my step dad about my mum. \n\nTurns out he didn\u2019t understand teenage girls. Tbf does anyone understand the working minds of teenage girls.\n\nBut it certainly sounds like you would be more happier if they wasn\u2019t round as much.\n\nYou was never going to be a family of three because your not. You married a man with kids. It was never going to be just you and him and then your child \nYou see you and three person family and you want that but he doesn\u2019t see you as three member family and that\u2019s the difference", "NTA. Husband can talk to the older kids and tell them that it\u2019s your birthday, and it\u2019s your wish, and that they can survive a couple of hours at a toddler activity without whining.", "I\u2019m not going to call you an AH because you\u2019re clearly at the end of your tether with your husband catering to two spoiled brats (which is clearly what they are, despite you being gracious). He is always working, except when they\u2019re there making your house\u2019s atmosphere tense. He never makes any effort for you. His only free time goes on them.\n\nYes they\u2019re his kids but he shouldn\u2019t have remarried and had another if he couldn\u2019t give a fair amount of time to you and your son. He has 3 kids, not one. He\u2019s coparenting with the ex. On his weeks with the eldest, *you* parent your son. On his weeks without the eldest\u2026 he works, so *you* parent your son.\n\nAnd now, it\u2019s YOUR birthday. Astonishingly, he\u2019s taken the day off. You thought you\u2019d be getting some time. Selflessly, you wanted to put that towards your son finally getting some attention from his father. But no. It\u2019s just another excuse for a day out for THEM. He wants YOUR birthday to be about THEM.\n\nLook, they should be allowed to come if they want to - to an activity for YOUR son. For their younger brother. Your husband needs to step up and parent their spoiled asses. Making a toddler attend activities tailored to two entitled bickering brats is grotesque. Making your birthday about two mannerless ingrates while your child is once again pushed to the side is unacceptable. Never asking these teenagers to think of their little brother for once? Shockingly bad parenting. \n\nYour husband is favouring the horrible, distasteful individuals he\u2019s raising, and had no business marrying you. Let them come - to the activity of your choice. If he refuses then I think you\u2019re going to have to divorce him before the favouritism becomes apparent.\n\nNTA.", "I hope people say NTA. I have 2 step children and have them every weekend me and my bf work full time so don't get time for ourselves luckily they are teenagers now so we actually get to leave them at home when we go food shopping \ud83d\ude44 only time we actually get to spend just the two us.

OP, have either one of you asked the teens if they want to acutally participate? If not, then that is the problem solved for both of you.", "NTA because asshole would be too strong of a word for this situation. Ima take another perspective on things and say the kids are old enough to the point that they can at least fake being interested for one day and help make your day feel special. The dad could just as easily talk to them about their behaviors problems and tell them to suck it up because your a hardworking mother who deserves to not feel like she\u2019s dragging her kids along even for the special days.  As for you, the mother and step mother, even if it wasn\u2019t the weekend the step kids were going to be there, your celebrating your birthday and those kids are now part of your life /family too now, so I understand why the husband invited them in the first place although I don\u2019t agree with his reaction. As I said, those kids need to suck it up and put a happy smile, not be on their phones bored and Atleast play with your baby and interact because you deserve to feel relaxed and not pressured to leave when it\u2019s your day. Having the step kids be included can help a lot with the emotional connection part of the relationship you hold with them. Again nta  for saying no but ehh, include your kids, even the non blood related ones.", "NTA and your reasoning is perfectly valid. Teens and toddlers have different interests. Catering exclusively to the teens is exclusionary for the toddler.", "NTA. \n\nAlso, I have no idea how old your toddler is now, but if this is the way things trend as they get older, they\u2019ll eventually start noticing.

So why can\u2019t OP just have One single day where she doesn\u2019t have to deal with it? \n\nI also feel like you never been in a situation like this. I was a step mom at one point, and it\u2019s exhausting to handle other peoples kids because godforbid you do something they don\u2019t like and they run off and make you look like a bad person. I also have a step dad, where I know he would rather just it be him, his kid and my mom or the two of them (him and his kid), and no one cared because our step dad was with us all the time.\n\nI\u2019m so tired of hearing \u201cyou got with someone with kids.

Otherwise, that would be excluding them and treating them differently, which is a pretty crappy parenting technique. Kids should be treated fairly and equitably. \n\nAnd no one said that OP and her husband shouldn't have child-free time, or that the toddler should always be ignored in favor of the teens either. Just the opposite, in fact; OP detailed instances of doing toddler-focused activities where the teens got bored. And that's just part of being a sibling. When we were growing up, sometimes I got bored doing stuff with our family that was geared toward my youngest siblings. Sometimes they got bored when the activity was something I'd asked for.

Because they can choose to focus on him every other day. Even if OP said it like this, what she really means is \"stepkids free\". And I find it cruel. Maybe I'm wrong, maybe I'm not. \n\nBut if my biological parents were working together for me to attend my stepmother's birthday, and she was like \"don't bother, I don't want them here, I prefer being with my real family\", I'd be hurt.

We periodically go out with just the younger one to try new restaurants and dishes and have conversations of interest to her.

Maybe point out where I said they should stay in a closet\nOh wait that's just you lying", "Why should there be drama if mom and dad goes out with their youngest kid? They do thing with only the oldest two without the little one\n Nothing wrong with 1 on 1 time.\nI have girlsday with my oldest and take another they with my son so that they also have their own day with mom. \nHusband does the same.", "Or you can just be over dramatic and ridiculous in your response on reddit, like you are doing here!", "Agreed. It also sounds like husband isn\u2019t helping in that regard.", "I agree, It sounds like all OP wants is for them to have some outings based around the toddler. His commitment to his kids makes me think he\u2019s a very good dad, but it doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019s splitting his time well between his older kids and the toddler and that\u2019s a larger issue. I will say though, speaking as someone who\u2019s parents had split custody, that as much as he only gets his kids 50% of the time that\u2019s still a fair amount of time, at least enough that he could afford to spend some time alone with the toddler too. If he only had them for a few days a month or something then I could completely understand focusing on them for that entire time.", "Eh I think the issue is the clear decision to split it into \u201cjust toddler\u201d or \u201ceveryone\u201d. Why isn\u2019t he able to create a rotation so there are some off weekends with toddler and some weekends with teens where he works? \n\nOtherwise, it creates some weird optics. \n\nIt\u2019s going to create a dynamic to the toddler of good vs bad weekends (not working vs working) and the next logical step is to assume that dad only chooses not to work if the oldest are home. That\u2019s going to create a weird sense of hierarchy and this kiddo may find themselves assuming they aren\u2019t the main event/as good as his siblings. \n\nIt also means, as OP said, that all family events are tailored to the older kids who complain if something isn\u2019t to their preferences. Where does that leave toddler? \n\nDad just needs to find better balance. \n\nHe\u2019s creating a weird dynamic where OP and toddler are waiting on-hold if the older siblings aren\u2019t there.", "Yeah, this commenter sounds like she neglects her younger kids with the way she is answering.

But this post isn\u2019t about what my family does day to day. My response is about how I would feel around a birthday. That\u2019s all.", "You're so gross. And that's not all I got from it; I thought that the rest of the post was garbage, too.", "If you actually read the post\u2026 every outting is always based on the teens because \u201cthey get bored easily and they fight with eachother.\u201d So why is it such a problem that on OPs birthday, she doesn\u2019t want to deal with it and just wants to bring the toddler for a dinner. Which in the comments from OP, it\u2019s just a dinner. Instead of dragging two teens out who probably or probably don\u2019t want to be there and have to deal with a mishap, if happens, just don\u2019t bring them. No one is calling anyone a dead beat. There\u2019s probably Court visitations they have set (since we are all speculating here), and it should be based on if the teens *want* to come or not. It\u2019s like you\u2019re contradicting yourself with your comment. If you even read my comment fully and just didn\u2019t come out guns blazing, I said \u201cask the kids if they want to come, but that means set rules, no bickering, no fighting, no complaining or they can go back to their moms\u201d I think that\u2019s a half way in between that both sides could get with. \n\nEither way, it seems like you still aren\u2019t getting the point that OP just wants to take their toddler out because it\u2019s probably less of a hassle, probably cheaper because the toddler isn\u2019t going to order food and probably will bring food for the kid, and OP can have what she wants vs trying to accommodate for teens.

They had all the years before this (at least 10) where they *did* get dad time. The toddler has never gotten dad time. And apparently they never get toddler time either. Plus since mom is also catering to the step kids, SHE doesn\u2019t get toddler time. He already got to do things with toddlers, I get it, maybe he\u2019s over it or never liked it that much, but OP and their toddler are losing out on things they will never get back and I feel it is his responsibility to make sure his toddler gets just as good of a life as his first two kids and not a divorced kids life without divorced parents.", "Also I\u2019d like to point out the older kids feelings. Even though dad is working most of it, they still see their time at moms and 1-on-1 time that their toddler sibling gets with dad too. So I think OPs husband is trying to navigate that too", ">OP isn\u2019t the asshole for her request in the slightest but the work schedule isn\u2019t the biggest problem here.\n\nWe don't know their finances, he may need to just be able to eat. \n\nHusband also sees his current partner, their toddler, and his teens as his family. It's probably a shock to him that his wife would want to exclude the teens, and he's defaulted back to something like she's an asshole for not being a good step parent. \n\nThe real problem is the teens can't entertain themselves somewhere not catered to them. My sister was 8 years younger than I was. I remember going to shitty things that I didn't enjoy. But I also had a game boy and some headphones. Let the kids check out if you want to go to a toddler-centric place. Also they're teens, let them wander a mall or go to a movie if you want toddler time. If you go to the movies do you all have to see the same movie? What if you and your husband want to see something that's rated R but they want to see something PG-13? \n\nKids of all ages need to understand that not everything is about them and if they're bored they need to figure it out themselves. Buy them each a retro Gameboy and download a million roms. Buy them each a smartphone (but put parental controls on it). Buy them each a book. Buy them each drawing journals. There are loads of easily accessible travel options that can keep a kid quiet and busy when they want to 'check out' of an activity. And notice I said buy them each, because you said they already fight so don't let them fight over a single game boy.

I think that\u2019s perfect time to do something the three of them. But I also hope the kids get alone time with their dad without their younger sibling.

It is a concession they make for adults, but i doubt they would be heartbroken to be not included. Most would prefer to stay at home and play games or, literally, anything else.
