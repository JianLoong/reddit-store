It is YOUR Birthday\n2. All relationships need attention not just the one with his teens\n3. You are entitled to want something or some time to yourself occasionally. Even non step parents have date nights and adult time.\n4. You have 3 children and the toddler needs to not spend her life only tagging along to teen appropriate things.\n5. In a healthy non blended family everything would not revolve around 2 of the members of that family to the exclusion of everyone else. It breeds entitlement.\n6. Has your husband got unresolved guilt around his divorce.", "Honestly I think you need to talk about how you feel about your husband working every weekend that the older kids aren\u2019t there. He does still have one kid there he is responsible for. If he didn\u2019t work every weekend they were away, I doubt you would even be in the position you are right now.", "Okay I was totally ready to rip into you. It\u2019s your birthday and you want to do something with a toddler that teens would not be interested in. That\u2019s totally acceptable and it\u2019s totally acceptable to do things with kids individually that does not involve other kids. So they\u2019re all getting alone time. \n\nPick the activities you want to do. Tell your husband this is what you want to do. If he wants to get his kids that\u2019s fine but make sure he mentions that the activities are more toddler based. If they agree they can\u2019t complain or be fighting. Make it an ultimatum. If they don\u2019t want to come then you\u2019ve given the option. \n\nExplain your toddler needs the same attention they get when they\u2019re in your home and since he works most weekends when he they aren\u2019t there he is missing out on having more dad dad time. \n\nNTA", "NTA but framing it as \u201cjust us\u201d does sound like you\u2019re excluding his older kids (they\u2019re not a part of \u201cus\u201d). \n\nPerhaps try saying that for your birthday you\u2019d rather deal with just one kid, not three, and also toddler goes to bed early - you expect hubby to give you his full attention and focus exclusively on you the rest of the evening ;-)", "NTA. As the only child to my mother and the third to my father I grew up in a similar household. I would watch my step siblings get my father's attention every other weekend while during our time I recived none of that special one on one or outtings. It is completely understandable in a split household to have activities as a single unit as well as ones that happen with everyone. Op's bday is a day that makes perfect sense to be a single unit day. That said it sounds like your celebration is planned for time that the step kiddos won't be there so there really is no harm. If your husband wants to celebrate together a second celebration is the way but he should be able to give you and your kiddo the same time he gives the family group, that's part of being a double parent...it's not a half time job.", "INFO: Would they want to be there for you on your birthday? If so, would it not be possible to tell these kids (who are apparently old enough) that you guys will be doing something that is toddler friendly, if they want to join? etc. Because if the kids would or wouldn't mind, would affect my vote", "NTA it's a matter of explaining that when the teens are there you guys modify everything to cater to them, but don't do anything for yourself or your toddler.\n\nYour husband may not understand this completely so you should come with examples of how you do all these teenager things, that aren't your, his, or the toddlers forte. \n\nAlso seriously take a day for yourself, don't be mom, or wife, or step mom, get you a day to just chill, if you don't eventually you'll burn out.", "May be unpopular, but I say NTA. Is your birthday and if you rarely do toddler centric activities, I think it\u2019s fair that you get to do that. Your child also deserves one in one time with their father. If you tried to exclude your step kids all the time, that\u2019s a problem, but there\u2019s a big age gap between the kids. It makes sense that the little one should get some time doing kid stuff that will straight up be uninteresting for the teens. If it\u2019s a big deal still can you compromise by doing something in the day with your toddler and then all going out to dinner at night?", "NTA the amount of people that CANNOT READ is amazing! You have every right to suggest it\u2019s just you 3 and doing something toddler friendly, if your husband has a problem with it tell him to go to work and do something with your toddler instead!!", "NTA I totally agree it\u2019s been centered around them for so long its overwhelming. Having to focus so much on other people is not fair at all! Y\u2019all should do baby things and you should do married couple things! Everything needs a balance and he better bond with his new baby! And how dare he not see he little shoved you in a corner. Working on the little time y\u2019all have alone not spending time with the little one and toddlers need stimulants!", "NTA. As long as you don\u2019t plan to disinvite the step kids in the future to other \u201cfamily\u201d things. \n\nIt sounds like they have a place in your family life and you do things all together all the time, which is commendable. So it is not wrong to plan something on a weekend you don\u2019t have them around for just the three of you.", "Nta, if you asked to go out for a romantic dinner with no kids, no one would say you're excluding them. Falling in love with someone with kids doesn't mean you have to want to be with their kids all the time. From what I gather, your birthday falls on a day where their mother has custody so why jank it up? Also I can guarantee that two teenagers aren't dying to go to a toddler friendly step-mother's birthday. Let them stay home.", "NTA. it sounds like you make a good effort with the stepkids and in fact have to watch your husband's children when he works. (which is really crappy of him to do).  It's not unreasonable for you to want to spend time with your child and your husband on your BD and he's a huge AH if he doesn't get it.", "NTA, so you never do anything with the toddler, because he works on the weekends when the older children are not there? And on the weekend that teh older children are there, all the attention goes to them?\nThe toddler is also entitled to outings appropriate to his age. And the right to attention from both parents.\nThat has nothing to do with hating the older kids.", "NTA.  The way you phrased it -  you want sub family time in addition to step family time; and activities focused on the toddler from time to time. Both are totally valid. \n\nYour hubs has done a good job of making sure the older kids are not being replaced by little one. That\u2019s a good goal.  Just need to find balance now", "NTA. We have a 1 and 6 year old together and for 6 year olds birthday we did something with only him.  We regularly have activities with 1 parent 1 kid, or 2 parents 1 kid. And of course with the 4 of us.", "NTA\n\nand if having something with them later when its their time to be with your family thats no worries.", "Have you ever tried talking to the older kiddos about the importance of doing things for the little one's development? Not all tweens or teens will respond positively, but some are sweet and might want to take the opportunity to be patient and learn.", "NTA. AT ALL.  It doesn't matter if they are stepkids, or fruit of your womb, having kids around all the time is a recipe for never getting time and opportunity to do what you want, which is a catalyst for resentment and depression.   ALL parents want a night away sometimes.  And the smart ones take it.\n\nYou all can celebrate with them on the following weekend.  Husband should be making this about you, not trying to compensate for his feelings of inadequacy as a parent or taking your day to shore up his relation with them.", "NTA. But you should be able to plan events that are age appropriate for your toddler. If it's not interesting for the teens, they can have their own free time. I see no reason that all kids of such disparate ages have to do everything together, even if they were all biologically shared.", "Definitely NTA. I feel like I could be writing this post myself. Personally I prefer a kid free celebration and then we do a dinner with all the kids. So many times my youngest daughter misses out on things bc my hubs won\u2019t let us make plans until we have waited for the older kids to be free or I have to wait for them to decline. Then sometimes they begrudgingly come because their dad forced it and then act bothered or complain the entire time. I love my step kiddos but teens just don\u2019t have the same interest as a little one.", "NTA.  Honestly,  your life is set up so you NEVER have the opportunity to have your husband and the child you share to yourself. It's only natural to want one day a year you can have that.\nPS- I take my comments back if your husband has insisted that your baby should spend the day with his ex on her birthday.", "NTA.  You both make sure that they are normally included.  If it's not their weekend and you want to focus on toddler activities, I honestly don't see an issue with it. Now, if it was part of a pattern where you regularly try to not include them, that would be a problem.", "NTA \n\nIt's a completely reasonable request. I don't understand the YTA's. I've had an evil stepmother and OP isn't it! \n\nIts your birthday x Yours.", "Unpopular but NTA, Just make sure that you ask your step children wether they would want to be with you, Or else they would feel left out, And if they don't wanna be there, So It's all good :)", "NTA. They\u2019re not scheduled to be with you guys that weekend anyways. So I don\u2019t understand why anyone would have an issue. Even if your husband thinks your the AH, he said you can do whatever you want. Compromise and tell him to ASK the teens if they want to come along to celebrate, but make it clear that it is UP TO YOU and if you want to choose an outing that is more focused towards the toddler than those are your birthday plans. Then tell the teens what the outing activity is, then let them decide. They\u2019ll likely say no anyways if they know the outing activity is \u201cnot cool enough\u201d.", "NTA. Your ask is totally reasonable, maybe you could even have a separate celebration with the stepkids on a different day. When my stepkids were at home there were times I would ask my DH if we could do something without the kids, because of the reasons you pointed out. As long as the kids are being treated equitably when they are with you, you don't have to do everything together all the time.", "NTA. Even if they were all your personal kids, trying to entertain a toddler and two teenagers is a lot. I seriously doubt that an adult's birthday is something they'd be devastated to miss, especially when they're getting fancy-fed as soon as they get back \ud83e\udd23", "NTA!!! It's YOUR birthday. Period.", "Very touchy topic.\n\n\nBirthdays generally create these issues. You want to do something because it is your special day...\n\nYour people want something else probably because it is a day of celebration.  \n\nSo NTA.", "NTA, it's important to have bonding time with the little one and if that doesn't happen often it can easily be accommodated now.\n\nI would sit down with SO and explain its not that you are excluding them or anything but just that you want some time with the little one and SO.", "NTA, he asked what you wanted to do and you wanted to spend time together with just him, your child and yourself. If he wasn\u2019t planning on something you actually wanted, then honestly why ask? You need to sit down and talk with him, that you love your step kids but he isn\u2019t spending enough time with his younger child doing things that the younger child will enjoy.", "NTA. It's entirely reasonable that your sub family unit spends time alone, just like he should be spending 1 on 1 time with your step kids. I would stress with examples the places you had in mind geared towards your youngest and plan a time for the entire family to celebrate your birthday together when it's the normal time with the step kids. Maybe y'all can do cake and a movie.", "NAH, sounds like husband may have misunderstood your intentions. Seems reasonable that the kids have different interests and would enjoy different types of day out. As a compromise could you have another day out next time you have the stepkids and do a 'second birthday'?\n\nThis sub often likes to point out that step parents aren't replacements for bio parents, so I don't see why this can't be the case here? Especially as it sounds like the stepkids have a good relationship with both bio parents still.", "I would normally say Y T A because leaving your stepkids out in favor of it being \"just our kid\" is what evil stepparents are made of, unless you're also equally taking each of them out, one at a time, so all kids get some time to have special outings alone with their parents/without other siblings.\n\nBut what saves you here is that you'd planned something for a time when the stepkids weren't supposed to be present. \n\nIt's reasonable to say, 'I'd rather celebrate with them when they come back on X day, and spend my birthday doing Y, which is a more toddler-focused activity'. \n\nI suspect this mostly comes down to how you worded it, since your husband is rightly protective of ALL his children, and wants to ensure your stepkids aren't excluded.\n\nFor that reason, NAH\n\nEdit to add- Why doesn't your husband just tell your step kids what the planned toddler-focused activity is, and ask them if they'd like to come? Chances are good most 13/14/15/16 year-olds would turn that down anyway. But they get to decide, and everyone wins. No one is excluded, and you get to do the activity you wanted with your toddler.", "NTA. It\u2019s your birthday. It wasn\u2019t their day to be there anyway. Celebrate when they are there for their time and have a cake. Enjoy your birthday with your hubby and toddler.", "NTA. It is completely normal to want some time away from your step kids. It sounds like your husband has been expecting you to put everything on hold when his kids are not with you. This is unreasonable and unfair. The step kids are old enough to recognize that just like their lives don\u2019t stop while they\u2019re at mom\u2019s, your lives don\u2019t stop either. Stop accepting your husbands need to put everything on hold unless all the kids are there. It\u2019s not fair to you and your little one.", "NTA.", "NTA.  Your birthday,  your plans (which are reasonable imo) should prevail.", "NTA", "I don\u2019t understand why people are saying YTA. They\u2019re not your kids for one. For two, you have a well established relationship with them, and already do family outings with them as it is, so who cares if you ask for one event with just you, husband, and toddler? It\u2019s not like you\u2019re doing something crazy and something the teens would enjoy. Toddler is too young to even really notice how \u201cboring\u201d or whatever the event is and doesn\u2019t need to be entertained as much as teens. I think it\u2019s unfair to have those assumptions made just because you want something for yourself. I don\u2019t think people realize how much sacrifice a mother makes to make a family happy, so godforbid **on your birthday** you want to do something you want. If the step kids want to be there for you on your birthday, make sure the father sets rules (no bickering, no droning/complaining, set boundaries\u2026 or they can go home)\n\nAs someone with a step parent majority of my life, if my step dad wanted to do something with just his kid, or his kid and my mom, me & my 2 little brothers wouldn\u2019t care because they\u2019re with us all the time and it\u2019s my step dads day, and he does so much for us in general, appreciated or not.\n\nImo, NTA\u2026 it\u2019s going to be your day and don\u2019t let anyone make you feel guilty for wanting things that make you happy.", "NTA it's perfectly acceptable to want a day to focus on the little one I honestly don't know how commenters are turning this into a step-kid bio-kid thing, the little one and bigger kids have completely different interests and are at different point in their lives and the older ones would have no interest in doing what the little one wants and based on this post and your comments you usually focus on the other two and try to make things fun for them and just taking the younger one with you.

You have times when 2 of those children are not with you so take your lil one wherever you want during those times.

Yeah, I get it, they're teens. But, do you know it, I have been a teen too (and I'm 22 so I haven't forgot it since). Either they go with you, and don't complain because this is a chance, not a punishment, or you alternate between a kid-oriented activity and a teen-oriented one and I guess they have a right to complain A BIT, or they just don't come when it's your toddler's turn to be entertained. But preventing the toddler (and you) of enjoying an activity is egoist.\n\n- Your husband, for thinking it's that big of a deal. If the kids were all biological siblings, it wouldn't seem out of the ordinary to focus on one or the other sometimes, because one-on-one time is very important IMO. \n\n- You, because you know deep down it's an excuse not to see the stepkids. You don't \"want to focus on the toddler for once\", you want a birthday free from the hassle of two grumpy teens. Otherwise, you would never consider not having them on your birthday. If it was a random occasion like a petting zoo, it's fine for me if you say \"don't invite the older ones, I'm sure they'd like it better staying in front of a game rather than touching goats and rabbits\" .

My husband and I share one child together who is a toddler and I have two older stepchildren who are in their mid teens. \n\nMy stepkids live with us half the week with alternating weekends. My husband tends to work the weekends that my stepkids aren't with us and as I work in the week, it's quite rare that we do anything me, him and our child together. We do lots of family days out on the weekends my stepkids are with us. \n\nAnyway, this year he booked my birthday off work which was a nice surprise and has said we can do anything I want. \n\nIt might sound a little odd but honestly I'd just really like to take our toddler somewhere a bit focused on them and have a day out me, husband and our toddler as it's very rare they get to do something focused on their age group with both of us and our full attention. \n\nI have a really good relationship with my stepchildren but when we go out, we tend to ensure its  older kid focused as they get bored easily and they are at an age now where they don't want to do anything considered lame / boring and will complain the whole time if so.

I've said I'd rather not to be honest and It's now a big deal and I'm apparently excluding and saying I don't like them (never have or would say that!). \n\nAITA for saying that on MY birthday, a day where the older ones were never meant to be with us anyway, I'd prefer it if my husband didn't try and change plans to bring along the older ones which means the focus of the day and what I wanted to do on my birthday will completely change?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It makes sense if they weren't supposed to be with you anyway, and you have more toddler focused activities planned. I don't know why people are saying y t a. As you say you're also going out for dinner with them a couple days later.", "NTA \n\nI think it's a reasonable ask to focus on the little one for a change. \n\nI don't think you're excluding the teens just planning things out in a way where everyone is happy and has a good time without getting bored or annoyed. \n\nAlthough I get why hubby would want them to be there for your birthday, he wants to share important milestones with them because you are all important to him. I know it's your birthday but it's an important occasion for him too. \n\nBtw how many days has he taken off work? Maybe you could all do something for your birthday day and then have another day to focus on the little one? Or he could take a day off on another day?", "You want a hassle free birthday. You aren\u2019t  being selfish. Talk with your husband.  The both of you sound like loving parents. Remind him that teenagers like to hang out with their friends more than their parents. They teens probably have plans because it\u2019s not the their weekend. Go have the birthday you wanted.

You have a pre-planned birthday dinner scheduled, because it is their scheduled weekend with their other parent.\n\nIt is nice of your husband to schedule a day off for your birthday. He asked you what you wanted to do. You told him. You didn't exclude your stepchildren. It isn't your weekend with them. You want to spend time with your husband and toddler on your birthday. Your husband is requesting you to call his former SO to request that his children be available to attend your birthday celebration. \n\nThis is what he wants. He has the day off. \"Why not spend the day with everyone?\" This is not for you. It is for him.\n\nYour stepchildren, and their other parent may have plans of their own.", "NTA.  You want to do things the younger one would like.  If every weekend you have the older children is about them, then the younger child never has any time with both parents that is about them (since dad works those weekends).", "NAH. \n\nHowever I will say it does come across kind of shitty to say you want to spend the day with YOUR child, but not his kids.  Your logic is totally sound, but its one of those things where the optics just aren't great. \n\nLike if you just wanted a date night, I'd think it would come across differently, but knowing that you want to hang out wiht a kid, just not those kids, can look bad.", "It's kind of hard to pass judgement here.  I'm leaning toward NTA because it's not unreasonable to want your birthday a certain way. However it's a little tricky with the way you've worded some of the detail about your teen step kids...particularly the feeling that you view them as separate family rather than all of you as one unit. You married into a family unit that already existed. You joined their family. The teens are not separate. You, and your shared child are an addition to the family. The way your describe things feels divisive and a little assholey. \n\n\n\nI think giving the teens a choice is fair and reasonable. have 2 teens at home myself, and they are asked often if they want to participate in something they may be less than thrilled by. They are also encouraged to be honest/not feel pressured by the wants of the adults asking (I often say, \"There is NO wrong answer.\"). They've opted not to participate numerous times. I think communication is important rather than the potential for them to feel purposely left out or unwelcome. \n\nFor this it would be simple enough to present the plans for the day and ask if they would like to participate. Example: \"We are planning this toddler focused activity to celebrate my birthday. I'd like to focus on toddler because we often tend to center our family activities based on you. If you'd like to join us,  you are welcomed, if not we will see you at dinner to celebrate all together.\" \n\nI cannot tell people enough how important communication is.", "NTA. Your birthday falls on a day that the stepkids are with their biomom. Wanting to focus one day on your toddler is perfectly fine. After all you are going out for dinner with the stepkids when you next have them as per the custody agreement.\n\nForcing the stepkids to go and do some toddler activity is pointless as they'll just get bored and end up fighting. Even asking them is needless as they're with their mom at that time. Your husband should respect that instead of trying to force them into everything, it is okay to take a day for yourself or your little one. That does not make you a monster, especially considering most of the time your family is doing more teen focused activities. Your husband should stop and listen to you before having a knee jerk reaction and acting like an AH.", "NTA \n\n>and has said we can do anything I want. \n\nClearly not a man of his word lol.\n\n>EDIT TO ADD: we are all going for a meal 2 days after my birthday which is when older ones will next be with us.\n\nThen wtf is he whinging about?", "So from a step daughter POV\n\nNo you are not wrong for wanting time with you just you three, I think your husband possibly misunderstood or thought it be a nice family day as in his mind your all family \n\nI don\u2019t think you hate them at all but from\nThe way you describe them wasn\u2019t nothing really positive about them.. sounds a bit like you resent the time spent with them as the baby doesn\u2019t get all the attention.

They could see you as actively trying to block them from their father, \nI certainly thought that with my step dad about my mum. \n\nTurns out he didn\u2019t understand teenage girls. Tbf does anyone understand the working minds of teenage girls.\n\nBut it certainly sounds like you would be more happier if they wasn\u2019t round as much.\n\nYou was never going to be a family of three because your not. You married a man with kids. It was never going to be just you and him and then your child \nYou see you and three person family and you want that but he doesn\u2019t see you as three member family and that\u2019s the difference", "NTA. Husband can talk to the older kids and tell them that it\u2019s your birthday, and it\u2019s your wish, and that they can survive a couple of hours at a toddler activity without whining.", "I\u2019m not going to call you an AH because you\u2019re clearly at the end of your tether with your husband catering to two spoiled brats (which is clearly what they are, despite you being gracious). He is always working, except when they\u2019re there making your house\u2019s atmosphere tense. He never makes any effort for you. His only free time goes on them.\n\nYes they\u2019re his kids but he shouldn\u2019t have remarried and had another if he couldn\u2019t give a fair amount of time to you and your son. He has 3 kids, not one. He\u2019s coparenting with the ex. On his weeks with the eldest, *you* parent your son. On his weeks without the eldest\u2026 he works, so *you* parent your son.\n\nAnd now, it\u2019s YOUR birthday. Astonishingly, he\u2019s taken the day off. You thought you\u2019d be getting some time. Selflessly, you wanted to put that towards your son finally getting some attention from his father. But no. It\u2019s just another excuse for a day out for THEM. He wants YOUR birthday to be about THEM.\n\nLook, they should be allowed to come if they want to - to an activity for YOUR son. For their younger brother. Your husband needs to step up and parent their spoiled asses. Making a toddler attend activities tailored to two entitled bickering brats is grotesque. Making your birthday about two mannerless ingrates while your child is once again pushed to the side is unacceptable. Never asking these teenagers to think of their little brother for once? Shockingly bad parenting. \n\nYour husband is favouring the horrible, distasteful individuals he\u2019s raising, and had no business marrying you. Let them come - to the activity of your choice. If he refuses then I think you\u2019re going to have to divorce him before the favouritism becomes apparent.\n\nNTA.", "I hope people say NTA.

Ima take another perspective on things and say the kids are old enough to the point that they can at least fake being interested for one day and help make your day feel special. The dad could just as easily talk to them about their behaviors problems and tell them to suck it up because your a hardworking mother who deserves to not feel like she\u2019s dragging her kids along even for the special days.  As for you, the mother and step mother, even if it wasn\u2019t the weekend the step kids were going to be there, your celebrating your birthday and those kids are now part of your life /family too now, so I understand why the husband invited them in the first place although I don\u2019t agree with his reaction. As I said, those kids need to suck it up and put a happy smile, not be on their phones bored and Atleast play with your baby and interact because you deserve to feel relaxed and not pressured to leave when it\u2019s your day.

All other trips have been geared to the teenagers. The toddler is a tag along on those trips. Husband said she could do anything she wants for her birthday. She said a day with us focused on toddler. They are going to do a celebration with teenagers after the birthday when it's their time with the teenagers. So Husband is saying let's deny our toddler another day even though the whole trip is supposed to be geared towards toddler. What's the odds of trip getting cut short cause teenagers are bored. Or plans having to be altered.", "My son is my husband's son.", "Keep us updated.", "Plus kids really value having 1:1 time with their parents. I was just talking to my mom and dad about a day where I had them all to myself and my fond memories of it. I'm a grandma myself now.", "In non blended families, it's great to split days between kids and interests. \n\nYou're celebrating your birthday with the older kids a couple days later. Spending your birthday with just the little one sounds great.\n\nIt is exhausting (often a good exhausting, often worth it,but still work) to plan activities and breaks and eating around multiple age ranges. \n\nJust keeping one kid happy is easy peasy after juggling multiple interests", "I get where you are coming from but I also understand why your husband is upset. I have 3 older kids (18, 17, 12) who live with us full time. I also have two with my husband (6 and 1)\nIf my husband wanted to exclude my older kids from a birthday etc this would be very upsetting for me and for them.\nMy husband knew he was taking them on when we got married and I would be very disappointed if he implied that our younger kids get a worse deal because of them- to me they are all equal, obviously. And it\u2019s fundamental to me that he gets that (which he does.)\nSo I can definitely see why your husband is feeling that way. But I\u2019m not saying Y T A as I understand your feelings too.", "Apparently they're going out for a celebration dinner", "Perfect. So NTA. Your husband needs to get over it.", "ADD that as an edit to the original post.", "So OP, her husband, and their toddler shouldn't do anything without the step kids even when the step kids are supposed to be with their mother?\n\nETA, OP's birthday falls during the stepkids time at their mother's. Making Mom switch her time short notice is shitty in my opinion.", "If they were all the same age, it would be a YTA. She said the age gap is quite wide. Doing things a toddler would want to do is something kids 10+ would not want to do. Having to take care of bored children while trying to give a toddler the stimulation they need means neither of the children get what they want.\n\nMy friends and family have days off for their older children/younger children if there's a big gap. One of my cousins had her first kid accidentally early and another 7 years later. Obviously there's regular family activities, but there's also specific activities for both.", "There are. They are stepkids, not kids, and not owed anything. NTA", "NTA. You literally did not read the post. She said SPECIFICALLY that she wants to go with just the toddler because if the teens do anything that they find lame, they will complain the whole time. They also said that all the activities as a family are done for the older kids. For her birthday, she wanted to be selfless and do something for the kid that doesn\u2019t get to do what they like very often, and that\u2019s really kind", "Exactly! My (f17) mother makes it a point to plan activities for the whole family and do one on one things as well. She\u2019ll have her date nights with her boyfriend. We\u2019ll all go out and do chores together sometime during the week. Myself and her will get a couple hours on Saturday together because that\u2019s when we go to our chiropractor and just drive around. And she\u2019ll be sure to take my sister (f13) out on dates too. \n\nIt\u2019s not so crazy for OP to want to spend time with her toddler with just her husband without the other kids around. That aren\u2019t even supposed to be with them on OP\u2019s birthday weekend, I may add.\n\nEdit: autocorrect fucked up", "I understand that, but them coming does not have to change what she wants to do w her day is all I\u2019m saying. \nHubs wants the kids to join them as a family, OP saying she doesn\u2019t want them to tag along will always make her look like an asshole. Even if it\u2019s not for malice, it will always look wrong. \nSo I say do what YOU want on YOUR DAY, OP. Fuck them kids feelings, & let dad deal w them being miserable. Him asking you what you want to do and then disregarding what you said is what really needs to be addressed. That, & why he never has a weekend off when it\u2019s just the 3 of you. But that\u2019s a whole other discussion.", "Yup things can be dramatic and true all at the same time \nLike young teenagers get very dramatic about things", "No, you need to grow up and be a parent to all 3.   You can take your child out when you don't have custody of the other children, nothing stops you but a birthday ..   your husbands children would want to be part of any celebrations for their step mum on their day.", "It is NOT \u201cplaying favourites\u201d it is NOT a \u201cfamily activity\u201d its a TODDLER activity that the teens will be bored out of their mind so why would you change the custody agreement to make them go somewhere they will be bored instead of the meal they\u2019re having in 2 day that IS the \u201c family activity\u201d", "Yes, they do! There were times when mine just didn't want to do the things we had planned, so they chilled at home, or one would go and the other wouldn't. Or we would want to do something without the teenagers so they both stayed at home. Sometimes their father would take just one out for one-on-one time (like a special event). No one was traumatized.", "Yeah, no you are entirely justified. It's just that your title makes you seem like an AH, and some people don't actually read the post lol.", "Don't listen to all the Y T A comments. You are not rejecting anyone or being unreasonable. If they were scheduled to be with you that weekend and you wanted your husband to send them back to his ex's or if you were regularly excluding them from activities, it would be a problem. Just for one day so you can focus on your little one? Totally reasonable, just as you and your husband could plan on doing one-on-one stuff with the older ones (like taking them to a concert or other event without the toddler). I would suggest making a plan to celebrate your bday with them the following weekend when they are with you, though, if they want. :)", "Would you also go out for a day with just your husband and step kids, no toddler?", "I misunderstood a few things and reread, I didn't realize it was an unscheduled weekend in the first place. It's a very difficult position, so apologies, you're NTA. \n\nI think either decision is fine, but good luck with it all!", "I am sorry, maybe \"absent\" was a poor choice of words. I meant rather that it would be better if their father didn't miss occasions when he can see them. If the matter is about neglecting his youngest, then maybe it is possible for all three children to spend quality time with their dad, without anyone missing out.", "And if it\u2019s a toddler centric activity they likely wouldn\u2019t want to go to that if they have the choice, toddler centric activitys don\u2019t usually appeal to teens, likely preferring the meal than hanging with a bunch of toddlers for the day", "But think if you had kids from a previous relationship.", "I guess I'd ask if you'd feel the same if your older kids were elsewhere that day and your husband said in that case we'll take the opportunity to do something focused on the smaller ones because they rarely get that. The fact the older ones aren't even with us that day in my head is what made me think this was fine. Like they aren't here and I'm sending them away or leaving them home alone so I can go out without them, but I think when they aren't there anyway, why can't we focus on the little one? It's good for them imo. As you say, all kids should be equal and that includes our son who rarely gets a day out that's for him.", "Are you honestly saying you never organise *anything* that is primarily focussed on the 6 or 1 year old?  You have never taken one or both of them to a toddler-focussed activity in the last 6 years? You ONLY organise events that the older teenagers will enjoy?\n\nBecause if so - that\u2019s not healthy or balanced. \n\nIf you do - then you don\u2019t seem to understand that OP\u2019s situation is entirely different from yours.", "Have done, thanks", "I think you replied to the wrong person.", "We don't have custody that day. That's the point. And we don't get to take our younger one out when we don't have custody usually because my husband works those weekends. Hence why this is a rare opportunity.", "Yep. I've done this in the past when it's been something small child unfriendly and my parents have watched the little one. For example we went to bowling and the cinema not long ago without our little one.", "Sorry just seen your update above thanks", "I guess I just see this as different because it's not like he's been asked if they can come to him because his ex isn't able to have them for example. He would specifically be going to her and saying can I have the kids on your weekend with them, no one has asked him to do that, not his ex, not the older kids, as far as they are concerned they are perfectly happy to spend the weekend with their mum, that's what they are expecting. \n\nI'd never say no if he said 'ex can't do this weekend so older kids will be with us instead', that's fine, it happens and we'd crack on. But to go out of his way to invite them when they aren't expecting to be with us when he knows I'd really just like a day when our toddler can be the focus because he rarely gets that just feels off to me. Like why can't you just spend some time with our toddler in the same way you do the older ones if that makes sense? What's the problem with just giving our little one ONE day? It makes me sad for them honestly.", "You're missing like half the points. They do go out with the three of them but teens don't want to participate in toddler-friendly activities. OP wants to do toddler stuff for one day.\n\nAnd dad isn't missing an occasion to see his kids because it's not his day to see the kids anyway.", "You mean on days he's not scheduled to have them. Days they're supposed to be with their mother", "I don't though so it's hard for me to say this is exactly how I'd feel without people thinking well how would you know? \n\nBut if you would like an answer then I think I'd be absolutely fine if my older kids were with their dad that weekend and I rarely got the chance to spend solo time with my youngest child by themselves, to go out with just them. \n\nI'd not be fine if my older kids were there and my husband wanted to send them away specifically but that's not what's happening here.", "But your husband wants his kids there. That's the point I'm making .", "NTA. You have made effort to have individual time with your step kids as well as include them in all other activities. It\u2019s your day so you can choose what you want to do, and you all weren\u2019t supposed to have the step kids on that day anyways. It also sounds like you have something planned the next time you see the step kids to celebrate. If your husbands really going to throw a fit about it, I would maybe choose what you want to do that\u2019s toddler friendly and frame it more as \u201cI was thinking going to ____ (craft time, zoo, play place, etc.) for the day. It would be geared very much towards toddlers so ___ could participate in the day as well. Step kids are welcome to come but I didn\u2019t think they would enjoy it and would prefer the celebration dinner we already had planned for the next day they are with us instead.\u201d Maybe they could even come out to just dinner instead of having them for the whole day if possible as well? But you are not the asshole so don\u2019t feel ashamed to push for what you want on that day.", "This seems perfectly reasonable.", "Okay but in asking why he is so against focusing on our little one for a change which older ones do get a lot. Like why can't our little one have the same occasionally?", "Thats a conversation you need to have with him. You need to ask him to take more days off when it's just the 3 of you.  But just don't do it on a birthday,  they are all about celebrating with people you love and by excluding them,  they are going to feel it :( ."]}
