She might be interpreting what her therapist is telling her to fit her own view of things.\n\nUnless you\u2019re in the session, it\u2019s impossible to know.\n\nNTA.", "NTA - Honestly unless you are attending these sessions too, I'd doubt she actually goes. Or she has one hell of a bad therapist. It doesn't sound like she is working through anything and going by what is posted I cannot say you are TA. Your girl on the other hand...", "NTA. I'd question what your partner is telling her therapist regarding you, if this is what she has said. \n\nMaybe worth a couples therapy session so that everyone in the room can defend themselves, communicate in a calm environment and find ways to move forward. \n\nAs a partner, there may, of course, be things you can do to work with her. But it shouldn't become the kind of situation where you're being told you're inadequate.", "Ask if you can attend a joint session with her to see if you can hear from the therapist personally about how you can be more supportive.   \n\n\nThis just sounds, from what you've shared, like super freaking weird therapist advice to be given, or is not the advice being given.   \n\n\nNTA as far as I can tell", "If she is actually going to the therapist, and if the therapist is actually doing as you say and along with her actions I'd seriously consider a new therapist. NTA\n\nWith extreme highs and lows and the way she speaks to people I'd be concerned about her being bi-polar plus, and in need of medication and real therapy.", "NTA. I bet this therapist is going off her version of events. And I assume her version is less than truthful. \n\nThat or the therapist is enabling the shitty behavior. \n\nEither way she sounds awful. You should probably move on. Because if therapy isn\u2019t helping there is nothing you can do.", "NTA. \n\nSometimes therapists become enmeshed with their clients, sometimes they don\u2019t want to be critical and hurt feelings, and sometimes a client just lies so the therapist takes their side. The truth is, some therapists just suck at their job. Either way, this therapist is not helpful in any way. GF needs to try someone new.", "NTA If that\u2019s her personality, yeah you have to accept it. Doesn\u2019t mean you have to stay around and deal with it though. If she doesn\u2019t see a problem with calling people trash, you aren\u2019t going to change that. Therapy is tailored to the person seeking treatment and is about what that person wants it to be about - if she doesn\u2019t see w/e as a problem, she\u2019s not bringing it up in therapy.", "NTA\n\nWhat kind of therapist thinks calling people \"garbage\" is acceptable? I'm guessing either the therapist is terrible OR your gf is taking something she has said wildly out of context. I'm just picturing this conversation in my head:\n\nGF: \"Sometimes I feel my bf wants me to just magically be rid of my OCD\"\n\nTherapist: \"He needs to accept that your OCD is part of you and to adjust his expectations about what managing your OCD will look like\"\n\nGF, internally: I don't need to change anything about myself, he just needs to accept it :)", "NTA - I would suggest group therapy. I would contradict what her therapist is saying but if you go to a session together you\u2019ll see for yourself.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

NO qualified therapist would do that.", "NTA.  Once she openly trashed your friends I'd be out.", "Nta but understand that you are getting info on what the therapist is saying 2nd hand. There's 3 possible scenarios here\n1) your girlfriend is misunderstanding or misrepresenting what her therapist is advising in sessions and is communicating her own version to you and not the one the therapist is communicating ( ever play telephone as a kid? )\n2) your girlfriend may not be super honest in sessions and her therapist may be having to relay off information that is not accurate or skewed in a way that is impacting her recommendations\n3) as in any profession some professionals are better than others and this therapist may not be the best or most skilled and be giving some off color recommendations", "It sounds like to me she is interpreting what the therapist is saying incorrectly, usually therapists don\u2019t say a partner needs to lower expectations for example. The therapist might say something along the lines of \u201cso what I hear is you saying your partners expectations are too high, let\u2019s talk about ways you can communicate your needs to them so you feel more accepted\u201d \nIt sounds like your partner is weaponizing her therapy against you and her friends, which happens a lot but is usually a mistake made by the patient not the therapist.  NTA", "I am not attending these sessions, although I have heard her on a zoom call with her therapist..", "Yah this right here..doesn't sound like anything a legitimate therapist would say. \n\nAt the very least you should go to one. If she gets entirely up in arms as a result, I would start becoming a little skeptical. You gotta go in initially and request to be present...for the right reasons. For example she keeps telling you, you're doing things wrong...ask her to attend so you can get a better understanding for your relationships sake. If you go in criticizing the fact she goes, she'll never let u attend. Atletast this way if she is telling the truth, she'd be more inclined to invite you.", "I think this is a very good point, although I wouldnt want to go there to simply \"defend\" myself, i feel like this is the opposite of what therapy should be about.", "Oh yeah, no going to defend anything! It just seems like the most straightforward way to get the advice from the therapist from the therapist's mouth and to ask questions and clear up miscommunications. If anything, it'd give a sense of what therapist says vs. what gf hears", "The fact that you want to be so subjective and not immediately go into defense mode makes me think you\u2019re a really good person and partner! Keep it up OP!! \ud83d\ude0a", "Agreed. It may be the case of the GF taking in the advice that suits her and just ignore the actual therapy.\n\nOr the therapist could be the one from the boru post who used their position to break up relationships."]}
