She is the only one responsible for this mess as she was untruthful from the start.", "NTA\n\nShe knew that it was a financial liability when she had it, and tried to wash her hands of the situation by dumping it on your bf. If a dealer tried to do that, it would be cause for fraud, and your local consumer protection agency would be having a nice little sit-down with them that would end up with your bf getting a tidy some of $$$.\n\nShe tried to sell your bf a lemon.", "NTA but your bf needs to grow up too.

How is any of this your fault OP?  He can't afford the car and she knew that from the beginning (hence, the 6 month leeway).  You don't her crap and especially for a crappy car for someone else.  NTA by any standard.", "We live 20 hours away and the plan was always to drive back home after fetching it. As such we booked and paid for accommodation at the halfway point. We were also only informed (by his aunt not sister) the night before we had to checkout and be on the road that the car is not safe and she fears for our safety. We were obviously terrified but prayed to arrive safely. The extent of the damage was only declared once safely home by external mechanic.", ">We were also only informed (by his aunt not sister) the night before we had to checkout\n\nI can understand trusting a sibling that they should have everything in order when it comes to things like that. But after hearing about it, why wasn't it taken to be looked at prior to actually agreeing to take the car? A lot of mechanics will do a 30-point inspection for you.\n\nAs far as who needs to take over payments, and when it needs to happen, it's based on what can be legally proven. Is there already a transfer of the title, or is it still in sister's name? Is it in writing about when your boyfriend will actually start taking over payments? \n\nDepending on what's going on with it, you both unfortunately put yourselves in a sticky situation by simply agreeing to still take the car. \n\nAnd for that reason, ESH.", "The sister claimed to have had the car checked out.", "NTA.

Sister already had a loan for the car. Then got a second loan to cover behind payments. On top of that its junk. Scammer if family pushes it again, they can make payments for her.

The sister ruined the relationship with her brother by trying to screw him over with a fucked up car. Who the fuck tries to do that to a family member they supposedly care about? I do think you have a potential problem with your boyfriend that you are paying for mostly everything. He needs to get his crap together. In your write up there is no mentioning of him going to college or getting any kind of vocational training. And he works a part time dead end job.

He probably should have been more proactive in refusing when he first saw the car and got into the agreement.

Hand shake deals won't cut it and the bank won't care as long as it gets its money.", "NTA I would've just told him it was his choice, so he was paying for everything related to it himself and not getting a dime from me towards it or a dime more support towards our usual expenses to free up money for it, then stayed out of it.

You should have walked away.  She of course is the biggest A.", "Mmmmmm seems pretty intentional. Like she royally ruined the car, repair estimate was only going up and probably not gonna last the life of the loan, figured bro has a \"rich girlfriend\" that will pay for it and might be to dumb to look into it further.

They should be pretty ashamed for this", "More i read that it kinda sounds like she was about to hit the end of a lease and was faced with a choice. Risk a massive excess wear bill or buy the car outright which would come with massive repair bills. So she wanted to pawn it off to him under the false pretense of simply \"taking over a loan\". Instead when he agreed, she pulled a likely high interest loan to buy the car from the lease and had NO intention on actually letting him skate for that 6 months.", "Ooooh... I've never leased a vehicle, so I didn't even consider that. That would make a lot more sense, thanks!", "So what? It was still in visibly poor condition.

Yeah, leases are great if you dont drive alot and take care of her car. If ya beat the piss out if it and never take it for regular maintenance you are in for one hell of a bill when you turn it in. Theyll fit for excess mileage fees (mine were 25 cents per mile over 12,000 per year), excess damage (dings cuts holes larger than an inch)  and whatever they need to do to return it to sellable condition.", "Total assumption on my part but maybe they weighed their options and figured driving the car home was better than buying last minute plane tickets/ booking a hotel and extending their stay to have it looked at by a mechanic?\n\nDon't get me wrong, I think this whole debacle was naive and short sighted and a huge waste of time and resources. They put way to much trust into the word of his sister, who it turns out, is a manipulative, lying backstabbing little shit.\n\nI'm surprised they didn't already know this about her since she was bold enough to try to pull off a stunt like this.", "NTA You didn\u2019t ruin your BFs relationship with his sister, she did, by trying to take advantage of him, sell him a piece of garbage, lying to him and then trying to turn their family against him.

If I've understood the condition of the car correctly, your aunt was right to be concerned.  You two could have literally been killed driving it home.\n\nNTA.  Your brother is right to cut his sister off.\n\nIf I were you, I'd have that external mechanic write up the formal estimate of what's wrong, what needs to be done to repair it, and how much it costs.  I would then take photos of that estimate and post them to the group chat with the words ***\"<Sis>, if you don't drop this I'll ALSO post the details of the loan and how you tried to financially screw over your own brother.
