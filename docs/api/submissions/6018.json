Yeah, leases are great if you dont drive alot and take care of her car. If ya beat the piss out if it and never take it for regular maintenance you are in for one hell of a bill when you turn it in.

Sounds like you\u2019re dating a hobosexual to be honest.", "NTA. I wouldn't have taken the car in crappy condition in the first place. It was a terrible deal to begin with, now it's worse. Also you didn't ruin their relationship -- she did. It could have been much worse if you weren't in the picture at all and he lived alone or something. Yikes.", "In my area, he\u2019d be stuck with the car.  He could\u2019ve had it checked by the mechanic of his choice. Buyer beware.", "NTA she freaking scammed her brother. NOBODY ELSE wanted this car. The only person she could scheme to get it off her hands and keep her whole was her own brother. No stranger was going to buy that hunk of metal. That was a repulsive thing to do .", "Se used up the car and now tries to get rid of the car and its responsibilities.", "I love when people warn you after you are waist deep.", "They were under the impression she\u2019d cover the next six months and then pay her back. She reneged less than two months in", "NTA. I mean, it sounds like his sister destroyed his relationship with his sister by trying to cheat her financially insolvent brother.", "Nta\n\nYou didn\u2019t do anything, she is the one trying to use her own brother\n\nThe fact he was willing to cut her off so quickly shows this isn\u2019t new behavior", "NTA what kind of car owner buys a car an doesn't do regular maintenance like Jesus Christ thats the first thing my parents taught me about cars. His sister did this entirely to herself and then tried to dump it on you guys.", "NTA His sister tried to con him, you saved his ass, now she\u2019s angry she couldn\u2019t con her junk away.", "NTA your BF sister tried to defraud a family member. Good riddance and good for you for stopping this.", "NTA. Your boyfriend's sister ruined their relationship, not you, not your boyfriend.", "NTA. Pretty easy call to make, too!", "NTA. Your partner\u2019s sister is a selfish grifter. You didn\u2019t cause the rift between them, she did that on her own.", "NTA. At all.\nI don't even need to explain why!\n\nIm just happy your bf was smart enough to understand that his sister is the AH and took your side.", "NTA, man she sounds like a piece of work.  Transfers g a bad debt to family wow.  Don\u2019t mix family and business.\n\nThe reason she is pushing it is no one else will take a new car after 4 years because the loan will exceed the value of the car.", "NTA\n\nI wouldn\u2019t want to see her again after that either. Not only did she lie to him about the condition of the car putting him on the hook for unexpected repair costs, she tried to pressure him to pay out more money earlier than agreed, leveraged family to try and manipulate him in to allowing her to take advantage of him, and when that didn\u2019t work threatened and insulted him.\n\nYou didn\u2019t make any of those bad decisions - the only thing you did is refuse to be a doormat.", "NTA, on top of swindling them into buying a car that was not maintained and has active issues, it sounds like the balance on the loans that they are to finish repaying' is more than this car would be worth even if it was well maintained. Sometimes family is the best at taking advantage, and you saved your BF and yourself here, the sister ruined the relationship. \n\nOP definitely set some boundaries and ground rules with BF, it sounds like he was in no financial position to make this deal, and did not ask the right questions (perhaps he didn't know the right questions). He needs to learn from this and improve his financial situation and  build some knowledge. Otherwise BF could dig a hole he(and you) can't get out of.", "Lol HOOPTY!!! I haven't heard that word in forever. It needs to come back.", "This!  Hard!!!  The whole time I'm reading I'm thinking why isn't this guy working???", "How do you damage the breaks in 4 years.  Did she ride both pedals the last 4 years", "Dude you know how this went.  Boyfriend caved to pressure from his sister and told himself maybe it isn\u2019t that bad we need to make it back.  Then did it at home.  \n\nDon\u2019t do business with family, you mix the emotional and personal side of life with the logical business and you make shitty decisions.", "That makes perfect sense. I\u2019ve leased once and got praised for its condition. I kept that vehicle pristine. To and from work car no kids.", "Me either!", "OP needs to ditch her loser bf and his crazy sister", "NTA. Their relationship already would have been harmed by her obviously trying to scam her brother. The only difference in this situation is that because you are involved, that seems to be the only reason why your boyfriend was not scammed by his sister. I'm glad he had your support so he was able to cut her off before bankrupting himself for her gain", "NTA. The sister is. She\u2019s all grays of shady for trying to pawn the crappy car with a high debt onto her brother. Good on you for encouraging him to stand up to her. You didn\u2019t ruin the relationship and if I were to guess, your boyfriend has told you the same. Best of luck to you.", "NTA", "NTA. You didn't destroy anything. His sister destroyed first her car and then her relationship with her brother by trying to defraud him and settle him with her debts. And I sure as fuck hope your boyfriend hasn't signed anything. Otherwise he might be screwed.", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA. And what the hell is her problem? Multiple times one of my siblings has given a car to another sibling and every time that car has been in excellent condition, taken to a mechanic before hand, and never cost the new owner any hidden fees. What kind of person tries to swindle their sibling like that?", "It definitely sounded intentional. She even lied. She had to have known what she was doing.", "Yeah really, like we're talking a lot about the boyfriend almost getting scammed, but given that you were going to be the one bearing the financial responsibility, for someone else's car, right now it sounds like you need to be the one setting limits because you're being scammed if you're taking care of him like a dependent", "Even when the right questions were asked, and prerequisites were made clear, she still lied. Not sure asking the right questions would have made a difference.\nStill OP is NTA.", "And, took out an additional loan she expected him to pay back. I hope her credit is ruined. NTA", "You are a couple which means you and your BF are partners. Any large financial decision made between either one of you by default involves the other. You should be shaming them for their backwards views on relationships.", "My guess is she couldn't afford her loan payments and was a few months in default, then when they send a letter of last warning, she took on a second loan (the gods only know from what kind of institution and at what rate) to pay the backlog plus all the fees that would have accrued.", "Seriously, there are so many people who don't want to stick their necks out to actually help you, so they wait until they won't get heat for helping you to actually step in"]}
