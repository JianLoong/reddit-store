I am the breadwinner and earn more than triple what he does (important for later) and because of this I see to most of our expenses. This arrangement works well for us. \n\nMy bfs sister recently relocated and asked my bf if he would like her car. She bought the carnew less than 4 years back. \nBy taking the car, the vehicle finance loan would transfer to him. As he only works part-time with an unreliable income his sister said she'd give him 6 months leeway and she would cover only the instalments ( he pays insurance) during that time but he is required to pay her back. I was sceptical as this was a big financial responsibility. I expressed my concerns to him but he promised to get a better paying job and that it would be his financial responsibility.\n\n\nWhen we get to her( she lives 20 hours away), we notice a huge crack in the windscreen.Fast forward to when we're at the airport and the car handover is about to happen. Here we find out that the car is in terrible condition. She has never taken the car for a service in its life , the car had an engen turnover, the brakes were damaged, tires old and worn and no spare as well as many things. Before coming down, my one condition was that the car had to have a long distance check and a full service to ensure we arrive home safely. She assured my bf that she did that and the car is ready for the long road. But before the drive back we find out that she lied. \n\nWe arrived home safely after a 2 day drive and had the car for a month and a half. She started putting pressure on him to take over the loan and no longer wants to give him leeway. She also tells him that she took out a large loan to prevent the car from being repossessed and that he'd need to pay for that. My bf quoted from a mechanic the cost of repairing all that was wrong and the amount was crazy. His total repayment would be 3 times value of car. \n\nTension started to build in our relationship because this car started also being my financial responsibility. My bf is not in a financial state to take over the repayments right at that second or the additional undisclosed costs. So I put my foot down and said that he has to tell his sister that he won't be taking the car as I will not be paying for it any longer. He agrees \n\nHis sister got really upset and the situation turned ugly, she made a group chat with various family members to \"mediate\" the situation but just threw all sorts of threats, insults and accusations my way.

We were also only informed (by his aunt not sister) the night before we had to checkout and be on the road that the car is not safe and she fears for our safety. We were obviously terrified but prayed to arrive safely. The extent of the damage was only declared once safely home by external mechanic.", ">We were also only informed (by his aunt not sister) the night before we had to checkout\n\nI can understand trusting a sibling that they should have everything in order when it comes to things like that. But after hearing about it, why wasn't it taken to be looked at prior to actually agreeing to take the car? A lot of mechanics will do a 30-point inspection for you.\n\nAs far as who needs to take over payments, and when it needs to happen, it's based on what can be legally proven. Is there already a transfer of the title, or is it still in sister's name? Is it in writing about when your boyfriend will actually start taking over payments? \n\nDepending on what's going on with it, you both unfortunately put yourselves in a sticky situation by simply agreeing to still take the car. \n\nAnd for that reason, ESH.", "The sister claimed to have had the car checked out."]}
