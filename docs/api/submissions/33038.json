Never did she demand anyone do anything different in their home for her. Our family on both sides were great about making sides vegetarian and the main was meat. My Mom would bring her own entree and everyone was happy. This was also in Alaska in the 70's and 80's and those big burly outdoors hunters did not have issues with being respectful of others.

We have a lot of family that just never could understand veganism no matter how they tried (and my poor confused mother tried very hard), and my husband's family treated us differently - excluded us from gatherings and made every conversation about how troublesome it was veiled behind \"discussion\" about what they went through to make x y z vegan. \n\nWhen the pandemic hit, we had trouble staying vegan due to empty shelves and decided to go plant-based. That means we essentially eat vegan 95% of the time, but we don't stress about minor ingredients as much, especially when traveling, and decided to eat fish and dairy when with our families to lighten things interpersonally. The compromise has helped a lot, honestly, because they don't treat us like pariahs anymore. lol \n\nWe shouldn't need to do that, of course, but I don't live in as much anxiety about eating the wrong thing now. I'll never eat pork or beef again, hard line, and they've been more respectful of that (not sneaking it into things or \"forgetting\") since we gave them some wiggle room in another direction.", "was it hard at first eating meat? sorry for asking so much questions, im just quite interested haha", "> decided to eat fish and dairy when with our families\n\nSo, you're a part-time pescetarian.

I don't plan to ever eat meat but I'm always curious about those who go back to it.", "It's okay! It was pretty unpleasant, honestly? I stopped eating meat and dairy for ethical reasons, not because I disliked the taste or texture, but once you view something as \"not food\" for close to a decade, it can be hard to stomach it again. My husband's family was isolating him, though, and that felt worse as his wife than disassociating for five to ten meals a year. Lol\n\nEven when I was vegan, I was never very militant about it. Everyone still ate what they wanted around me, and I never brought it up myself. The only time we talked about it was with his family or when my mom forgot butter was dairy for the eightieth time. So it honestly has been helpful for my mental health to loosen the reigns so they can't get under my skin in such an easy way.", "You'd be shocked at the number of people who assume I eat fish when they hear I'm a vegetarian. Also, I get \"vegetarian\" recipes that have chicken broth all the time.", "Yes, that's still known as \"plant based,\" and that's the difference between being vegan vs plant based. If the vast majority of your diet is exclusively plants, as in only a few of your hypothetical 1095 meals a year include animal products and you don't purchase animal products yourself, that's just what it's called. It isn't a personal definition. \n\nA very scholarly source for you: \nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant-based_diet", "I cannot tell you the number of meals with family where we dealt with having to explain over and over again that we didn't eat fish or milk or eggs, and the temper tantrums when we wouldn't eat what they prepared. It never seemed that complicated to me, but people get incredibly confused if they've never tried to eliminate something from their diet before. And some people get unreasonably angry when they get things wrong or you ask to bring your own food. Those are the absolute worst."]}
