My fianc\u00e9\u2019s parents are divorced because his mom cheated on his dad with her now fianc\u00e9 and his former best friend. We didn\u2019t separate the baby shower so now she is pushing for my fianc\u00e9 and I to have a separate birthday party for our daughter at her house when my daughter turns 1. We told her no as we had already made a reservation to have her birthday party at a resort. My FIL is completely fine with everyone being invited but MIL is the one that is throwing a fit.

If you go down that road,  you will be setting a trend that she will expect to be repeated every birthday, Christmas,  Thanksgiving,  Easter, etc. \n\nYour MIL needs to grow up and suck it up.", "NTA. And good thing you are establishing how special events and holidays will be celebrated. If you give in once to MIL, you would have years of arguments etc, as she tries to exert her authority over you celebration plans.", "NTA\n\nKind of a ridiculous request when fiance's Mom is the one who cheated \ud83e\udd23 Dad doesn't seem to have an issue.", "MIL probably doesn\u2019t know the parties and celebrations are not for her? Did anyone give her the memo? \n\nWhat a joke. NTA. Please get rid of her she\u2019s toxic and her values are warped. I doubt she has anything worthwhile to contribute in the upbringing of your child.", "NTA.  The party is for your daughter's benefit, not for MIL.  Who does she think she is to demand a separate party?  \n\nThe human race has some members that walk in shadow.", "NTA, your MIL does realise the world didn't revolve around her, right?", "So, your FMIL broke up her marriage by cheating on him with his best friend, and she doesn't want to be around her ex to remind everyone about her despicable acts. C'mon, she's a  (at least) middle-aged woman, not a high school mean girl. She can learn to grow up if she wants to be at her grandchild's party.\n\nNTA.", "Absolutely NTA.  Best to nip this in the bud and not give in now - or you'll be dealing with this for the next 18 years.", "I'm gonna say NTA. Parties are exhausting, even more so for parents of young children. And they're still exhausting even if someone else is doing all the work. You're still expected to host and be social while making sure the child is taken care of and enjoying themselves and all that and it's just... no, if you don't want to, then you don't have to. \n\nIt sounds like FIL is being the bigger person here, even though he was hurt the most from the little bit of information you gave us. Your MIL is being childish and doesn't want to face her mistakes. That's on her.", "Absolutely NTA.\n\nYour MIL needs to grow a pair and put her grandchild first. Whatever issues she has (although I don\u2019t know what as she\u2019s the one who cheated with his mate) with your FIL are hers and hers alone. Not your child\u2019s. if she refuses to come to anything because your FIL will be there then that\u2019s her bed she may lie in it.", "NTA\n\nThrow your party.  MIL can come or not as she sees fit.  MIL is the AH here.\n\nEdit to add: Sorry that you'll be dealing with this woman for a long time.  :(", "NTA\n\nBegin as you wish to continue. No separate parties for MIL. She can either come to the one event you host or she can miss out. Do not allow her to set this precedent. As your child gets older. Your lives will become busier. There will be activities and parties for other friends. Plus, weekend nuclear family activities. You won\u2019t want 2 celebrations for every event in your child\u2019s life. But she will be demanding then if you don\u2019t shut it down now. Also, there will be many events where it isn\u2019t possible to have 2. Games, recitals, graduations etc. \n\nIt isn\u2019t MIL\u2019s birthday or event. She does not get a separate party.", "NTA, cheaters don\u2019t deserve to be catered to \ud83e\udd37", "NTA. So she destroyed her marriage and is now suffering the consequences from that fall out and expects to be catered for", "NTA. She needs to get over it", "NTA", "NTA, she probably just doesn't wanna see your FIL face and be reminded of her extremely selfish and shitty choices. That's on her but no one is gonna accommodate that bullshit. Now, if she wanted to host a little party HERSELF, that's the only acceptable thing because no one is gonna pay for double parties because she cant face the man she cheated with!", "NTA. Even if she was offering to pay for the second party, it's ridiculous that you would expect to make time for two separate events for the rest of your lives. And what about the rest of the family? Are they really going to want to go to two deferent parties for the same person? What she's asking is not a good option. Maybe offer to let her come over privately if she's not comfortable attending, but you absolutely don't need a separate party.", "No... no.. No. NTA", "NTA. In this situation she certainly isn't entitled to dictate what happens, so she very clearly needs to be told no. If your FIL, who has more reason not wanting to see her, is OK with everyone getting together, what is her problem? If she chooses not to come, it is her problem, I wouldn't even let her set up her own party.", "NTA.   No you are not!  Your marriage, your baby, your decision.  She cheated, it\u2019s her problem, not yours.  She can go to the party Ott stay home.  That too is her choice.", "NTA\n\nGood on you for establishing boundaries early on. You'll have one party, you'll organise it or choose where it happens and who throws a fit doesn't have to attend.", "NTA. Go as low contact as possible", "NTA But allowing her to dictate terms for future family events is a bad road to go down. I suggest you stand up to her and put a stop to that right now, for your own sanity.", "NTA\n\nIf you let this happen once, it will happen for every event.\n\nYour MIL has to decide if her love for her granddaughter is greater than her hate for her ex husband.", "Absolutely NTA. If you do separate parties you're inviting a world of headaches onto yourself. If MIL doesn't want to go to the party because your FIL--who is fine with the MIL being there--will be there, then she can just not go and miss out.", "NTA\n\nBUT if your MIL wants to throw a little party for your daughter at Her house (she's responsible for paying for/supplying any&all 'party' supplies) another weekend - why not?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
