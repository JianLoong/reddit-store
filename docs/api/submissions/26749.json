They got divorced and my dad married the woman he cheated on her with. Eventually my sister and I became comfortable enough to be around her for family gatherings and the like. However, there was a constant issue of her starting minor dramas with my mother and my sister over the years, something my father never believed when confronted about it. Needless to say we have never had a close relationship with her. \n\nFast forward to about 2 months ago. My dad calls me upset. He and his wife had just got back from a two week east coast road trip and she had suddenly declared she was leaving him. He was devastated and blind sided. Eventually it came out that she had been sexting somebody 10 years younger than her, and potentially more. \n\nMy dad proceeds to go through a spiral of depression dealing with a broken heart, something I think he had never experienced before. He had various epiphanies, feeling sorry for what he had done to my mom, apologizing to her and her husband for the drama over the years, and apologizing to my sister and I for how poorly he had treated us. We silently held onto hope that he was becoming a changed man due to this and we were helping him through his tough time by talking him through his low points and being there when he needed. \n\n During this time it is known that she was definitely sleeping with the guy and partying. On top of that, when she moved out she took almost $30,000 out of their account - they had a prenup so she was not likely to get any money from a divorce and likely took it because of that.\n\nLess than a week prior to the birth of my second child, the last grandchild my dad will likely have, he announces to me and my sister than he and his ex are going to get back together and try to work things out. Obviously neither myself or my sister are happy about it and neither is my wife. But I tell him my reservations but tell him ultimately he can make his own decisions. He assures me he will be careful and I leave it at that. \n\nMy wife goes into labor and we are at the hospital. I let my dad know that the baby will be here soon and he says he is coming to the hospital. Since I did not think the birth of my child would be the appropriate time to take the step of accepting his wife back into the fold, I asked him if she would be coming. I didn\u2019t say she could not come, I just asked if she would be. \n\nMy father proceeds to come unglued. He says \u201cNo, she wasn\u2019t, and now neither am I.\u201d And tells me I need to grow up and learn to forgive since he had forgiven her. He doesn\u2019t come to see my daughter at all. I try to explain my reasoning and that it would just take time but he does not relent. I eventually sent him a message saying how hurt I was that he did not come and that he essentially chose her, after all she did, over greeting his newest and last grandchild.

He flipped all the way out. He illustrated, again, that he\u2019s selfish and unable to think of anything beyond himself. That\u2019s so disappointing. What a short-lived epiphany.", "NTA.   You did not, in fact, ask him not to bring her.   He made an assumption (probably the one you wanted him to make, to be fair) and overreacted because it's an issue that's very emotional and stressful for him.   But now he continues to behave like a child.", "NTA. Your dad is on a roller coaster though. Taking her back means he has to prove that *you* were wrong about the ex, not him. Easier for him to act like a baby than visit the baby.", "NTA - you are right, bringing her back around during this special time would be bad timing. I'm sorry your Dad is being a baby about it.", "Your father should reconsider his priorities if his cheating wife is more important than his newborn grandchild. As a parent, you choose who gets to see and interact with your baby and no one else.\n\nNTA. Let him throw his tantrum.", "NTA, of course, and congrats on the birth of your daughter. \n\nBut for the sake of your mental health, you might consider some distance from your father and drawing some boundaries. It's unfortunate that he's continued to act in a selfish way, replying to your entirely reasonable and valid thoughts and feelings with childish and manipulative tactics like the silent treatment. As sad as it is, at some point, it might make sense to consider just how much of that kind of crazy you want in your life.", "NTA and cut them off for this. Don\u2019t even bother feeling bad about it. He\u2019s not worth the trouble. He\u2019s only concerned with himself.", "NTA at all \n\nDelivery and post partum is a very vulnerable time for your wife. I appreciate that you try to sort out potential stressors.\n\nYour Dad's wife sounds like a potential stressor.\nYou didn't even uninvite her - you just asked your Dad about his plans. The fact that he reacted emotionally and only _assumed_ you'd uninvite her proves that he _knows_ it would be wrong to bring her.\n\nHis troubles, not your problem.", "NTA. Your dad has proven he is still fundamentally wayward in his thinking. No personal growth at all.", "NTA.  You can invite anyone you want to see your child.

Hopefully he will come around soon and realize you were right.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nShe is why he left his family. She is why he has now lost his senses again.

Enjoy your new baby.", "NTA.  Maybe try LC/NC for a while and see how you feel?", "NTA.  Your father definitely had a few issues.

He overreacted and didn\u2019t come b/c he was embarrassed\u2026 he aired all his dirty laundry and now has to eat crow b/c he\u2019s taken her back despite what she\u2019s done.", "Honestly, your dad sounds like he's more trouble than he's worth.\n\nI certainly wouldn't bother with him as you haven't mentioned a single positive thing he brings to the table.\n\nNTA", "Dad is too embarrassed and  knows you all know who she is and what she did. He always puts himself first it seems so I\u2019m sure this isn\u2019t a surprise. It\u2019s a pity he is so immature and childish that he let it all come before meeting his grandchild though . At least you can use him as a cautionary tale on how not to parent . So not all is lost.", "NTA. He dgaf about you", "NTA gin no contact.", "NTA.  First, like everyone else said - you asked a question.  And he took a page out of step mom's book and created not just drama, but a family divide.  Your dad is being a donut.  This woman has caused YEARS of grief, betrayal and drama to everyone in your immediate family.  Stop trying to explain or fix things.  This is for your dad to fix and apologize for his ridiculous behaviour.  Don't worry, he'll be back when she cheats / leaves again. Focus on your new family and those that bring something positive to your life.", "You are NTA!  Your dad on the other hand is a huge a**!", "NTA.  You were right to protect your wife and yourself from the potential drama having her there would have caused. Your dad has been prioritizing his relationship with her over his relationship with his children for years. That\u2019s not likely to change.", "NTA\n\nTbh Your dads just selfish! She\u2019ll cheat again & he\u2019ll reach out apologizing. In the mean time go LC or NC", "NTA. She went through that 30K fast!", "I was so hopeful he had really made some changes after his epiphany, but sadly not. Disappointing indeed.", "He has always been one to jump to assumptions, so it certainly wasn\u2019t out of character for him. But I think you\u2019re right that he overreacted likely because of the vulnerability of the situation.", "Thank you so much. \n\nAnd yes, you\u2019re right. I\u2019ve had to go no contact with him in the past. The only reason we ever reconnected was because his parents died of covid. Things were not bad between us after that and I was cautiously hopeful he had changed. But, alas, it seems to not be so", "I think that is likely my only option, you\u2019re right", "He has always been one to easily jump to assumptions, but I think you\u2019re right - he knew it would be wrong to bring her. He just didn\u2019t like it being pointed out and then threw a fit", "Yes, I believe you\u2019re right.", "I\u2019m starting to think your line of thinking is correct.", "I very much am. Aside from his outburst, the day went by almost perfectly for momma and baby.", "Sadly I\u2019ve actually had to go nc with him before due to toxic behavior. Reconnected after his parents died to covid and things were better for a time. I\u2019m lc with him now and fully intend to go nc should the need arise moving forward", "Yes I don\u2019t intend on allowing her back into the fold again. He will just have to deal with that dynamic himself at this point.", "I have learned a great deal on how not to parent from him, I am sad to say. You\u2019re right, it was not a surprise, but sad nonetheless", "She\u2019s only back for more $$$$ he\u2019ll figure it out.."]}
