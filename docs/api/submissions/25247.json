If so, laws on student records tend to vary by state. In NY, student permanent records must be kept for a minimum of 20 years. You would likely have a legal case if they could not supply them.", "NTA. Get a lawyer and sue them for their pants", "NTA. Get a lawyer asap. Is there some education body you can complain to?", "NTA, it\u2019s a school, you\u2019re not suing a person, you\u2019re suing the school so yeah, fuck em, lawyer up and get your transcripts", "NTA for consulting a lawyer.\n\nHowever, actually suing may not work.  \n\nIf the records were lost (e.g. computer damage) they can't provide them.  \n\nAnd when you sue, it generally is for money damages, which would be hard to calculate.  How is this hurting your finances?  On the one hand, there is purely hypothetical income that may come if you go back to college, finish a degree, and get a job in your field.  On the other hand, if you used the transcript to get into college, that's going to cost you, for tuition, books, renting an apartment, living expenses, lost income if you can only work part-time instead of full-time when studying.  etc.\n\nIronically, people who graduated before records were computerized can have a better chance of getting their records, because a paper transcript doesn't become obsolete, technologically.  Anyone can walk to the file cabinet, find the section for your year of graduation, and pull out your folder which is stored with others from your class, in alphabetical order by last name. If you have computerized records, and they upgraded their software, records can be lost, because the new technology may not be backwards-compatible with the older digital records. \n\nIf the records are obtainable, but difficult to get to (e.g., have to send someone to a warehouse where paper backups were stored) a scary lawyer-letter may help inspire them to make the effort.  But if someone saved the records with old digital technology, such as using one floppy disc per student, they may not be able to read the records.", "NTA. And you should absolutely sue. Your transcripts are yours, and they need to provide them on request. If they refuse or, worse, they've lost them, you are entitled to rectification and compensation. They've messed up, very badly.", "NTA \n\nI dont know where youre from, but in my country there are Laws where the Transcripts have to be kept for 30 Years. there may be similar laws in your country. I would contact a Lawyer or do some research. \n\nSometimes the threat of getting a Lawyer works just as well as really getting one.", "NTA. At the very least they should provide a letter stating that they are unable to provide any transcripts. One well written letter from your attorney should take care of that. If I were you I would definitely get a lawyer.", "We don't know the laws we're you live. Seek real legal advice.", "Yeah so fuck them. They dropped the ball not you.\n\nThat being said you've already done some college so shouldn't they already have a copy of the GPA or whatever?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
