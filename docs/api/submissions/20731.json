I responded with \u201cwell I don\u2019t really need to be nicer with rides as I am an adult and pay for my car and I am not really responsible or obligated to be driving anyone around but myself\u201d.

My jaw kind of hit the floor as my sister wasn\u2019t obligated as my guardian \u2026 so how am I obligated 10 years later when she is older, engaged and lives far away from me. \n\nI grabbed my stuff and said goodbye to everyone at the Father\u2019s Day event and when my mom noticed I was leaving she asked why. I said as I walked out \u201cwell yeah wouldn\u2019t you be upset if you mother called you vindictive after she made an unreasonable request to you?\u201d \n\nShe chased me out of the house to my car where I drove away from her so she couldn\u2019t make the situation worse.

She probably had more resentment than I do but I think I got more of the trauma as I was diagnosed with BPD.

If she tried to make it easier for me to help I would be more willing to do so. \n\nAs for my obligations I would argue I have more because I live alone. I don\u2019t have a partner who helps me with things like groceries, cooking, cleaning, maintaining my car etc. these things with my work schedule take up a lot of time not to mention I have my social life and relationship to also give my time too.

Yeah, your mom has a lot of nerve.  Your parents have no room to pass judgment on anybody since they very conveniently forgot they were your parents for most of your teenage years.

She had a good portion of her living expenses paid where she would have had to pay them herself otherwise. \n\nAlso as a teenager I was book worm. All I did was study.

I've done it myself. You don't have to DO anything it's the exact opposite. You do NOTHING. mom sends you a text? Do nothing (don't respond) Mom tries calling? Do nothing (don't answer it) . She shows up at your house? do nothing (dont answer the door - if she doesn't leave you will have call the police but that's pretty low effort compared to dealing with her). The only hard part really is if you are relying on them for anything you are going to need to find a way to provide that for yourself because you can't accept things from people who treat you bad it just creates a dynamic where they hold it over your hear so you are forced to continue the toxic relationship with them. You need to take that away from them so you hold the power. It sounds like you already live on your own so this shouldn't be too hard.", "\u201cShe did it for the money\u201d \u201cit wasn\u2019t out of kindness\u201d \u201cshe benefitted\u201d You keep mentioning those things but never once consider what she may have lost/delayed/set aside in her own life to help you. You are minimizing. \n\nOP, your problem is with your parents. Consider that your parents manipulated her into taking you in the same way they\u2019re trying to manipulate you into helping her now. I really doubt at 16 you knew the whole story of how they got her to agree to take you in. You say you had more trauma but what if she did? Was she \u201conly watching Netflix\u201d or was that how she was coping?", "Doing nothing is super easy it is true. But I just don\u2019t have the heart to ignore my family like that.  I always think what if it\u2019s an emergency or they really need me. \n\nBut everything you have said is spot on and I have to deal with that all the time with them. Always having things dangled over my head, and it\u2019s stuff from SO long ago. And that\u2019s because I don\u2019t ask for much from my family as they either won\u2019t do it or they do and dangle it in front of you for the next 10 plus years. \n\nI have considered cutting ties but I am just in the process of seeing how realistic that is.", "Though my sister took me in and provide more support than she was obligated I did essentially raise myself (with her help here and there). \n\nThough she was physically present I still felt very alone because of the lack of things she was obligated to do for me. And I never held that against her as I understood that she wasn\u2019t my mother. But I did feel very alone as result of this.", "You can call it minimizing but I call it providing context and facts to the situation. I understand what happened at that time as I was involved in the conversations with my parents and her regarding her taking me in. \n\nI understand she probably had a hard time coping. And so did I. \n\nKeep in mind my parents also left me too not just her (and I have the BPD Diagnosis to prove the abandonment issues from both of them). And due to the lack of obligation my sister communicated I felt very alone and had to grow up quick to do lots of things for myself even though she was my guardian so to speak.", "I just finally had had it with my family, because everytime I went over there it turned into them using me as a punching bag for the jokes..Growing up my brothers learned from my dad that the way to socialize with other people is to make jokes at their expense. And frankly nothing was out of bounds, my dad straight up called my younger brother fat and laughed at him to everyone in the room like he wasn't even there. I don't get along with that brother, never have but I spoke up and said how really truly mean that was of him to call his own son names like that an hurt his feelings. He insisted my brother was fine, but I could see he was trying not to cry or something. That's just how they all are and my mom is just a wet blanket who puts up with it and even tries to join in because it's probably nice not being the butt of their jokes for once.\n\nShe texted me one day and I jsut said listen I'd like to be left alone. She says d she understood and left me alone for a few months and then my brothers first kid was on the way and I think that was the kick in the pants I needed. She started messaging me again and I just decided to not respond. She sent a few more texts trying to act like I was dead or something (hello? Are you still alive?) and I realized she's never going to get it. So I never responded and she finally left me alone. No more texts asking for money, no more being told by my brother how she made fun of me behind my back after asking me for money and not being invited to stay. Honestly it's great. I don't think of them ever. My brother will text me still and invite me over to meet his kid I have zero interest in. I honestly just laugh to myself at how pathetic they are and move on with my life. Problem solved. Wish had done it sooner.", "Nope NTA here. But you only have one family. Then again, the situation is created by your sister and should be fixed by your sister. For edample, she could get a second car.", "There is more to this story.", "That exactly how I see it too. Thank you for the comment. Very reassuring.", "There really isn\u2019t but read the responses to some comments for more context maybe?", "I feel that our family dynamics are very similar. And good for you for having the strength and motivation to take a big leap like that. Maybe one day I will find myself taking the same leap. I have already decided I will not be reaching out to my mom or sister for a good while. I\u2019m going radio silence until I feel more respected.", "Good for you. Take the power away from them. You hold the cards now. If they disrespect you then just leave or hang up. Remove yourself from the situation.", "That\u2019s usually how I handle it but as you can tell from this post my family doesn\u2019t take boundaries well, which is why I might have to just remove myself from them all together. :("]}
