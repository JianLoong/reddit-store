It\u2019s important to note at this time my sis made it clear to me that she wasn\u2019t obligated or responsible for driving me anywhere. \n\nObviously this wasn\u2019t ideal as my area for transit was kind of sketchy and I had to figure out how to get around with no help. But I understood my sis was already doing so much for me. So I learned the transit system and that\u2019s how I managed. It was costly and took lots of time but I wasn\u2019t going to give my sis a hard time. \n\nTime passes, and my area is having a  rise in sexual assaults against women. Being a student I was working nights and evenings. Also I was less than 5\u201dand less than 100lbs. I was a prime target based on police descriptions. Due to safety I started asking my sis to help me just with rides home from work at night (which most nights she was only watching Netflix). She said no (again not her responsibility). \n\nI ended up telling my mom and dad as they provided financial support for me for her to take care of me . They got involved and convinced her to do it til the man was caught. \n\n10 years later, my sister now lives and shares her a car with her fianc\u00e9. The car is hers but she lets her boyfriend use it as he works further away and she transits. Well my sister has been struggling with the inconvenience and I know this as she has mentioned it to me a while ago. \n\nSo on Father\u2019s Day I was with my mom (60F) and she mentioned to me that \u201cI need to be nicer with rides\u201d. My mom lives far so I knew she was hinting at my sister. I responded with \u201cwell I don\u2019t really need to be nicer with rides as I am an adult and pay for my car and I am not really responsible or obligated to be driving anyone around but myself\u201d. She said she knows I am not obligated but I should make more of an effort because my sister is \u201churt\u201d (for context my sister now lives 35 minuets away from me). \n\nI then told my mom if she remembers when I was a teenager and how my sister NEVER helped me with rides and only did so the time there was a predator because I made a big deal. \n\nMy mom just said, \u201cWell that\u2019s really vindictive\u201d. My jaw kind of hit the floor as my sister wasn\u2019t obligated as my guardian \u2026 so how am I obligated 10 years later when she is older, engaged and lives far away from me. \n\nI grabbed my stuff and said goodbye to everyone at the Father\u2019s Day event and when my mom noticed I was leaving she asked why. I said as I walked out \u201cwell yeah wouldn\u2019t you be upset if you mother called you vindictive after she made an unreasonable request to you?\u201d \n\nShe chased me out of the house to my car where I drove away from her so she couldn\u2019t make the situation worse.

She was given responsibility of you at a young age & neither of you were given a choice in that situation. Now you\u2019re adults so the choices you make are yours alone to make. Talk to your sister.

Your sister needs to figure out a workable solution, which sounds like accepting the car your mom is offering and paying for another parking spot. \n\nIf your mom brings it up again don\u2019t bring up the past, just point out the impracticality; if she persists then you can suggest that she should be the one to offer rides to your sister.

You can do this, you would just rather do anything else.  \n\nYou're giving a lot of other reasons, but those all sound like things that should be part of the discussion with your sister.  I'm willing to help, but here is what I need - $X for gas, advance warning of X days and a clear pick-up / drop off time and location.", "TY for being understanding & compassionate in your response- I'm getting voted down so I know it's not a popular opinion but oh well, and of course, I do understand your sister seems to def not be compromising either - sisters are not perfect, and some days are harder dealing with them than others for sure \ud83d\ude05 but please know that I come from my own perspective with good intention and how I've felt about it...", "Gotcha!

She probably had more resentment than I do but I think I got more of the trauma as I was diagnosed with BPD. We both definitely had it hard and it definitely changed the dynamic of our relationship. \n\nHowever I don\u2019t really like that my sister acts as if I am forever in her debt for this as taking me I\u2019m benefited her financially because of my child support payments. My parents made it clear if she didn\u2019t help with me she would have to financially take care of herself (as I was a minor and she wasn\u2019t and they didn\u2019t have funds to support both of us separately). That is why she decided to do it. It wasn\u2019t just a she stepped up. She was motivated through money to keep me.", "Also I forgot to mention when I am in her area I do call her to reach out and ask if she needs a ride. I just am not in her area as much as I use to be. And there are times her fianc\u00e9 has dropped her at my place on his way to work and then I take her places. So it\u2019s not that I don\u2019t help at all. I am not help as much or in the way she wants me to.", "I would love to work more with my sister to accommodate her but she isn\u2019t the easiest person to accommodate as she plans largely around her boyfriend and doesn\u2019t like to probe him for answers so that I can better accommodate. She doesn\u2019t offer funds or to meet at easier places given her distance from me. If she tried to make it easier for me to help I would be more willing to do so. \n\nAs for my obligations I would argue I have more because I live alone. I don\u2019t have a partner who helps me with things like groceries, cooking, cleaning, maintaining my car etc. these things with my work schedule take up a lot of time not to mention I have my social life and relationship to also give my time too. I can\u2019t use all my spare time driving her around and neglect my needs.

They\u2019re going to pull these guilt trips on you for the rest of your life.", "Oh boy! Seems your sister should focus on that problem and not the driving around lol! Because already not being able to like sit down and talk to your boyfriend about something?? And they\u2019re not even married yet??

Either raise your sister or we won\u2019t help you financially is actually more like extortion. Kind of like drive your sister everywhere or we will take away your car. Not really great options there.\n\nYour parents should have done more than pay someone to care for you. They essentially hired a long term babysitter. You\u2019re certainly not indebted to your sister anymore than you are to your parents. It sounds like you pretty much raised yourself.", "That seems reasonable.  I wish you the best =)", "I have raised this concern many times to her but she see no issue. I got her a therapist cause this really concerned me, apparently she is working on it, but I mean she is still in this situation so I question how much she is actually taking from it. The therapist is a good one too. I have seen her a few times and researched a lot into her."]}
