You don't need to go to the wedding, but you do need to consider your words for how you interact with him and be more kind.", "NTA\nI\u2019m sorry but a 40 year old dating an 18 year old is just extremely creepy to me. I\u2019m 41 & the though of dating a 19 year old just makes me nauseous. If they just started dating now at 47 & 25 it\u2019d still be odd but not as creepy as a teen & a 40 year old. Besides if you don\u2019t respect his choice you don\u2019t have to support it. Her poor children!", "NTA - \n\nYou're very much entitled to your feelings.  You feel it's weird and creepy and you don't want to be part of it.   You shouldn't feel obligated to support something that makes you uncomfortable.", "NTA. Isn't this grooming?

Yes, a 40-year-old woman dating a teenager was creepy and inappropriate. Yes, you are right to not support this relationship that almost certainly deprived your brother of coming-of-age experiences, could potentially prove detrimental to his future and is frankly unlikely to last. But you were wrong to decline to go to the wedding, both for ethical and practical reasons: In my view, we should support people we love, even if we don't agree with their choices, provided they aren't hurting others. Also, if (when) this marriage breaks down, it would be better if your brother had a strong support network, not an estranged sister.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou didn't need to pretend you buy into their true-love narrative, or fake being ecstatic. You could have said to your brother \"I don't agree with this relationship or your decision to marry, but I will be there because I love you\".

You wouldn't.", "YTA He\u2019s happy and they\u2019re getting married, even if it is a mistake it\u2019s his to make.

You\u2019re not. You choose the people you spend time with, plain as that.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been vocal enough for the family to know that you oppose the marriage up until this point, then they should all already know that you don\u2019t support the relationship. You shouldn\u2019t be forced into any situation that makes you uncomfortable anyways.", "NTA. When you get married, will you be seeking his approval?", "Hm... That will surely change your relationship with your brother and will have problems in future. The age difference is too much to be honest. However, you can't avoid his wife because he will be bringing her to every family event and it's not worth to fight with the whole family for your brother's choice. Hard times await you. You don't have to like his wife but you will have to accept her so there's peace. NTA.", "YTA. Your brother is a 25 year old adult. He gets to make his own decisions about his marriage. Don\u2019t go to the wedding if you don\u2019t want to, but don\u2019t think you have the moral high ground because of how weird it seems to you.\n\nEmmanuel Macron met his eventual wife when he was 15 and she was his 40 year old teacher.

Are you saying you can\u2019t make peace with whom your brother loves but you\u2019re absolutely fine with avoiding them potentially for the rest of your life? I\u2019m really curious about your thought process on these points. (And, of course, about your answer to the first question.)", "NTA. This is grooming. If this were an 18 year old girl and a 40 year old guy, I\u2019m pretty sure OPs parents wouldn\u2019t have conceited and accepted the relationship, so you\u2019re absolutely right in finding it creepy OP. But you should make sure that your brother knows you still support HIM and that you\u2019re there for him when he needs to get out of this marriage.", "YTA. Unless your brother is in some way being exploited or manipulated, your opinion on his relationship is just prejudice.\n\nI know a couple who were in a similar position. She was at least 20 years older, he was in his 20s. His family totally disapproved, and he basically went NC. They have been a devoted couple for over 40 years.

You have a good relationship otherwise ? If so, you should be there for him at his wedding. It doesn\u2019t matter one bit that you don\u2019t approve of the age gap, this is the woman your brother has chosen and you are risking damaging your relationship with your brother, one which has 22 years invested in it.\n\nHe\u2019s an adult. Trust that he knows who he loves. Assuming he stays with her forever, you\u2019re going to hold out this disapproval of their relationship for the rest of time ?? Really ?\n\nOr are you going to grow to accept her and then regret not going to the wedding ?\n\nAnd the flip side, if it fails at some point in the future, you can at least say \u2018I knew it\u2019. Do you want to be that person ?\n\nYou don\u2019t have to like her, or approve of his choice, but unless you have a rocky relationship with your brother already, why wouldn\u2019t you go on what may be his only wedding day ???", "All I can say is go watch the movie Licorice Pizza", "NTA-\n\nYou have to admit she may have a good idea there.

The only thing he has to look forward to, is her aarp discount though.", "YTA. I don\u2019t blame you for being concerned and telling your brother so. But he is made his choices. For the sake of your relationship you should go to the wedding but not be a groomsman", "YTA even though I agree with you that your brother\u2019s relationship is creepy and probably not going to end well. The thing is, family should still be there for support in bad times as well as good. You\u2019ve made your feelings known, but you should still go so that in the future when this relationship does come crashing down, your brother knows you\u2019re someone he can lean on.

It's hard to judge from a distance, but I say you should go. I understand why you're uncomfortable, and you're free not to go, but your brother will probably be hurt and not want to associate with you as much after. NAH", "YTA. If it's as sus as you think, you and your parents should be there for your brother. If not, you'll push him further into her grip and she'll have him all alone. Be there and stay in his life so he has a safe place to come for help if he needs to.", "Yta, they know how you feel so stop bringing it up you are not magically going to make them not get married", "I go with NAH, leaning to YTA\n\nSince they have a long lasting relationship already, I'd say they have proven, that it's true love and not just exciting for them.  \nOn the other it's your decision to come or stay away. The judging part isn't cool though.", "YTA. I mean yeah the age gap is pretty large and it may feel weird but deal with it. As long as they both really love each other why do you care about their ages?", "NTA You don't have to support toxic relationships and there is a reason she can't date anyone close to her age. She groomed him like a predator.", "YTA if you won't go. Od say go out of respect to your brother and leave as soon as possible if you feel the way you feel. Also, why? Is she financially well off?", "Doesn\u2019t matter her age . Once your brother gets married see ya later .

OP's brother's future wife met OP's brother when he was a minor and they've been \"dating\" since he was 18.\n\nThat is predatory grooming. In general, if two adults are getting married with a 20+ year age difference... weird to me but whatever.\n\nThis is different.

If it was a 25 year old woman marrying a 47 year old man (who she started dating when she was 18 and he was 40), everyone would jump to grooming. But it can't work the other way right?

My family is well off though anyway, I don't see why it would be about money. My brother is in med school", "First of all, it\u2019s in invitation not a summons, so OP is absolutely NTA for not going, also it absolutely is creepy, grooming works in both directions. Physiologically the brain develops until the age ~25  and I\u2019m sorry but no 18 year old is nowhere near the same maturity level as a 40 year old.", "Ugh I just can\u2019t even wrap my mind around that.", "After 7 years? Yes I would. Like I said the whole thing is/was creepy but at 25 you\u2019re a grown ass adult. We see it aaaaalll the time when money is involved. Unless they met when they were like 15/16 and waited until 18 and wanted to get married at 19/20, then I think 7 years is long enough for problem behaviours to come out.", "Sounds like grooming to me, they met through her daughter when he was 16.", "Was surprised I had to scroll this far to see this comment, my first thought was grooming.", "I think it\u2019s creepy both ways but honestly for the sake of his relationship with his brother I think he should go to the wedding but not be a Groomsman. I would say the same if it was a sister who was getting married", "Just like there are different people, with different opinions.\n\nFor me it's ok both ways. I for myself don't see the appeal but heck, whatever floats your goat... As long as you aren't hurting anyone.", "I don't care if it sounds osed minded but when the age gap is that big and he was just at the legal age (mostly speaking) something is off. I don't buy the \"love\" thing. Such a smart guy us willing to give up having his own kids ? Or what? Have their mother be at an age of a grandma ? Hope he gets I when it's not too late", "They first met when my brother was 16. Her daughter was in the band with him. My parents originally thought he was dating her daughter.", "I agree, this sound very much like a Mrs. Robinson to me", "This makes her a predator, pure and simple. If the genders were reversed, no one would support this.", "Please add to the original post. This woman clearly groomed your brother", "Yikes...", "This needs to be part of the main post. Otherwise, it sounds like they met when brother was 18 randomly, not through her daughter.", "Alright, now it\u2019s getting creepy, but I think you\u2019ve left it a bit late to be making objections and in which case you should be there for him and be ready to help pick up the pieces if/when it goes south. Unless he or she have done anything in particular to *you* then he\u2019s still your brother and you should still be there for him.", "Yeah that's my thinking. I actually even told my brother would you be okay, if me at 22, started dating a 45 year old with kids my age. He didn't have a response for that.", "You should also ask him if he\u2019s good with your younger sister (16) meeting her future 38 year old partner today", "While it\u2019s fair to bring this up your brother is an adult old enough to pick his own partner.\n\nYou don\u2019t get a veto.\n\nAlso he doesn\u2019t get a veto on yours either. \n\nIt\u2019s literally his life choices and he is going to face the consequences of his life choices when he is a 40 year old married to a 67 year old or when he cannot have kids potentially and is a step grandfather to in his thirties\n\nI think for the sake of the relationship you should go to the wedding. I would not stand up for him."]}
