Could you just explain to her that you can't afford to pay her back?\n\nIt probably would've been better to mention that you didn't have space for the food while she was dropping off the shopping though, so that it didn't go to waste and she could've taken to excess stuff back with her.", "NTA - but this is definitely a time for sincere, enthusiastic thanks and a very clear explanation that:  \n\n\n(a) you literally don't have it in your budget to pay her back fro the extra she bought  \n(b) you literally don't have the space to store most of the perishable foods she bought and can she help you figure out what to do with them?  \n\n\nDon't try to go into detail about WHY you think she overbought: it was a sweet and generous gesture! But the key things are that **you can only afford to pay her back for what you asked her to buy**, not the extras: and **the extras that you can't pay her for are hers** \\- you can't store/use them all, what would it be OK with her for you to do with them?", "Semi wtbta for wasting food mostly. \nWould have stopped her when she came in like 'Whoa, I appreciate the help, but I can' t afford all this, and I don't have the space for this. I can barely keep food down at the moment, so most of the perishables would go to waste.'\n\nWould have saved a lot of trouble.

Tbh NTA as it wasn\u2019t stuff you wanted to originally get it\u2019s like ordering 1 meal at a restaurant and and they bring out more and expect you you pay for everything \n\nBut it doesn\u2019t seem like she asked (or you just didn\u2019t add it) so I don\u2019t think she minds for giving you the stuff for free", "YWNBTA\n\nIf she gives the rest/all of it as a gift, everything is fine but don't feel obligated to pay for stuff you didn't order and don't need.\n\nIf you would order something online and get extra stuff you didn't order, you wouldn't pay it either. Or if you go to a restaurant, order a chicken and the waiter brings three chickens, you woldn't pay for the other 2 chickens, would you?", "NTA, you didn't ask for this, so not wanting to pay for it seems normal to me. But may be you can help her next time, or giving her something, to stay nice, i think she did it because she wanted to be kind to you.", "NTA\nI would thank her for thinking of you and taking the time to shop and bring you things.  Tell her you had intended to oay her back for the items you asked her to buy but can not cover the extras due to having a tight budget though. Tell her that in light of your budget and your limited storage space maybe she would ike to take some of those items to her house for her own use.", "NTA- you\u2019re not responsible to pay for items you didn\u2019t ask for. Only cover the things you actually asked her to purchase.", "NTA. I think you could offer to give her back some of the food, especially if you don\u2019t have any room to store it. I don\u2019t think it is reasonable of her to expect you to pay her back for things you didn\u2019t even ask her for. It sounds like she did this out of the kindness of her heart or maybe she likes you, I am not sure.

You asked for very specific items. She decided to go out of her way. Just pay her back for the chicken. That\u2019s really all you asked for. And don\u2019t even give her all of it. You still need to get medicine. It wasn\u2019t fair that she got you things that weren\u2019t on your list and expected you to be okay with it and have you pay her back.", "What did you do with the chicken breasts?", "NTA  \nThanks her so much. Tell her it was thoughful.   \nTell her you are on a tight budget and can only afford the three items you asked for (medicine, one chicken breast and crackers). Tell her you're sorry you didn't say anything in the moment but you were still not feeling well and bit overwhelmed. Say that you paying her back for the items will take up twice your entire weekly food budget and she is welcome to come by and take any of the items back. You can apologize for any confusion.   \n\n\nBut honestly, it was thoughtful of her to bring you stuff, but not thoughful to bring you stuff you don't want or need or request.   \n\n\nAlso, you want to ask her directly because the excess might be gifts? If she is hinting around being paid back for stuff you never asked for, you need to address that.", "This would be a NAH situation, as far as I can see. You didn't ask for that extra stuff, so it was on her for buying it all without asking.\n\nBe honest with her. Thank her for all the goodies but it would also be perfectly acceptable to explain that you don't have much space for all of it and you're on a tight budget. If she wants to be paid back in full, ask if you can pay it back in installments. Or maybe you can do something nice for her in return that won't cost you money.\n\nAs you said, I doubt she was doing anything maliciously and might not have understood  your predicament.", "NTA but send her a message saying \u201clook I should have said this earlier, but I didn\u2019t want to be rude, but I have to deal with this now. I cannot afford to pay you back for all this stuff. I\u2019m on a tight budget and it would be most of my budget to pay you back. I never eat cheese or chocolate because it\u2019s just too expensive and it\u2019s also way more than I asked you to get me. I just don\u2019t have the money, especially when I need to buy medicines as well. I can pay you back for some of it and you can come and pick up most of it to take for yourself if that\u2019s okay for you. The perishable stuff like the chicken will go off if it stays here anyway since I don\u2019t have freezer space where I can store it. The most I can pay you is [insert amount of what you expected to pay for what you asked for] since that is what I had budgetted for the chicken, crackers and medicine. I\u2019m sorry for not saying something sooner- I didn\u2019t know how to handle this situation without being rude.\u201d", "Has she actually asked you to pay her back?  or is she just being a friend supporting another when they are down?", "That sounds like the best plan considering it really was nice of her!! Just a misunderstanding", "You're completely right, I panicked tbh and didn't want to hurt her feelings or something.", "Agree, this would have been a better approach.\n\nIt's much trickier to say street you accepted everything that you can't pay her back. That looks tacky even though I understand exactly what you've said about why. \n\nI suggest asking if you can pay back in installments because that's a huge part of your weekly budget. If she isn't paying rent, she will hopefully be able to absorb that \n\nAnd learn the lesson for next time, that you communicate better up front, or if it happens as in this case, at the point she turns up with an that stuff.\n\nIf you refuse to pay her back at all YWBTA.", "Very much hope it was that! The fact that she even offered to go to the store for me at all is a good sign", "Hasn't asked directly yet but there were a few stray comments that means she does expect me to", "currently sitting in the fridge unopened. No room in the freezer to store them", "everything is easier in hindsight. you're defs NTA & this girl needs to pull her head in a bit. if someone gives you a list for groceries & you buy them more than what they asked for that becomes a gift. \n\nI'd send her the money you would've spent on the original items & profusely thank her for getting you additional groceries when you're sick & on a tight budget. make her feel like she'd be a bad person for demanding extra money for a gift ;)", "I do that too. It's totally fine.\n\nI think you should talk to her and tell her the reason why you didn't speak up in the first place was because you panicked and didn't know how to react without potentially hurting your friendship. Try to work out a compromise with her. Ask her if she wants to take some of the food because you aren't able to store them anyway. Let her know that you are on an extremely tight budget, and you don't know how you'll be able to pay her back. A good friend would be understanding and help you figure all of it out. My money's on she's a good friend since she bought a bunch of food that she thought would help you feel better. XD", "thats ok but that was a choice you made and now owe for those groceries. in times like this you speak or forever hold your peace. let it be a lesson to speak up when necessary. cant just be hiding your feelings then try to back out of a debt later.", "NTA, but I'd probably pay her back in smaller bits over time and, explain when you do, that she bought things you didn't ask for at way more than you could afford. Then never ask her for things again. This is only if you want to maintain the relationship. She lives at home and doesn't have to budget yet, she probably doesn't understand what hardship her \"favor\" was", "You should eat the one you requested, then you and your roommates make something you can share from the rest. \nPay your friend for what you can but make sure you can get medicine. There are ways you can return her kindness that don\u2019t take money. \n\nNTA", "Cook everything, invite her over for a meal, and send her home with leftovers.", "Yeah, stopping her would have made it clear that you can't afford all of that as well as giving her the opportunity to say it's a gift. \n\nWhen my partner and I were quarantined, a neighbor offered to pick things up for us and then separately, someone left us a care package. Making it clear that it was a gift."]}
