She ended up slamming her door closed  ending the conversation. \n\nI ended up being the babies to pick up their dad from the hospital.\n\nBut the next morning my sister was giving me the silent treatment and being passive aggressive when I asked her why she was acting this way she told me that I'm no different then our parents claiming that I don't respect people decisions and should've accept her no the first time or not even asked because I know how she feels about babies.\n\nI was a little taken back and told her that I'm sorry you feel that way but I believe in the end I accepted your decision not to watch my children. \n\nWhen I complain to my friend about the whole situation she kinda agreed with my sister stating that it's not her responsibility to watch my children and that I should've left it with the first no. \n\nAm I the asshole for asking my sister or over asking my sister to watch my children?", "created_utc": 1671592812, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zr8uax/aita_for_asking_my_sister_to_watch_my_children/", "score": 608, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Has she ever changed a diaper, fed one or both twins, or been left alone with any babies before?", "NTA.\n\nBut you need to sit her down and talk all over.\n\nI know parents are strict, but she's living rent free, food on the table and phone payed. She needs to give something in return. That's family, you help each other. \n\nOr she can go, get a job and star paying like a roommate would do.\n\nEdit: \n\nThere seams to be a group attached to the part that I didn't called parents abusive. Yes, they sound like abusive. \n\nBut I never said to ship Sister back. I said to hold Sister responsible for her choise to act like a roommate (no responsibility regarding the kids). If she wants to be a roommate, she needs to pay like a roommate, so OP can afford to pay for a babysitter. But if sister wants to be treated like family (living rent and board free + phone), she needs to act like it and help when needed.\n\nAt 17, Sister needs to understand that she can't have everything without giving something in return. \n\nMy comment about parents been strict is more related to having rules to follow in a house you don't provide for. Even if OP is not a parent, Sister needs to follow the house rules, just like the babies will have to do eventually. OP's house, OP's rules.", "NTA she is living in your house for free. If you need her to watch the kids to help someone else she should help you. It doesn\u2019t seem like she had other plans. You could also say that you give her a place to stay and don\u2019t make her pay for anything she had to watch the kids __ hours a week to help you out.", "NTA-Watching them while you did that wasn\u2019t some massive hardship. Perhaps your sister felt staying with you was a freedom to not do anything but mooch off you if you\u2019re feeding her, paying her bills and providing a roof over her head.  You made allowances for her but she\u2019s not made any for you. I see what she gets out of staying with you, but How is she living with you actually benefitting you?", "Just as much as older children dont owe someone free babysitting, you don't owe her a roof over her head, food in her belly and clothes on her back. You let your sister move in out of the kindness of your heart and she can't even do a simple favor. I'd start making her pay her share of rent if she's gonna be like that. Tell her your free care services for her is over. She can pay rent or move back in with mom and dad. See how quickly her behavior turns when she loses the privilege of not living with overbearing parents. \n\nNTA", "NTA. I think it was completely appropriate for you to ask your 17-year-old sister to watch them for an hour or so so you can do something important. I\u2019m a firm believer though that family should be able to help one another out especially you are doing so much for your sister.", "Nta. I think you both need a sit down after that situation and discuss how you both feel and set reasonable expectations and behaviours around the home. Such as emergency babysitting for a few hours. Maybe some chores to help around the house. Maybe a part time job to feel some independence and NOT pay you back but learn to manage things herself. And also lose the passive aggressive attitude, best to nip it in the bud. Also say next time you'll respect her choices a bit better as you were also feeling overwhelmed from the emergency with your baby daddy. But never speak to you like that again, and take a moment to appreciate your kindness. You're doing it from love for her, but you won't tolerate being treated like that. \n\nAfter staying with your parents, it's a big change and she hasn't adjusted yet to a healthy home and is possibly pushing boundaries, like toddlers do when they feel safe to do so. No one is the asshole here, just some damaged and overwhelmed sisters. \n\nIt's going to be a long road to unlearn behaviours she's seen around the home, but also to feel safe and understand her new found freedom and self accountability. There's also an implied give or take, which should be addressed a bit more vocally as you'll both just end up resenting each other over implications.", "NTA, because this was something important that came up that you probably wouldn\u2019t have asked for otherwise, but if she has no experience handling babies and/or is just one of those people who is not comfortable around children then I can\u2019t say I blame her for saying no either. That said, she\u2019s putting up a HUGE stink just for being asked twice. \n\nEdit: I read that actually used to babysit other children, so disregard some of the above paragraph.\n\nIs she doing ANYTHING for you around the house? If no, that needs to change because you are going above and beyond helping her out and giving her a place to say. If it can\u2019t be caring for your kids when the need arises, then it has to be something else.", "NTA.   You are not her parent.  You need to lay down some rules for her.  She should be doing things at your place and helping you out.", "NTA\n\nIf everything went the way you said it did, you asked once, and then pleaded one more time and then dropped it, then you're NTA. Your sister is being a dramatic teenager. It wouldn't hurt to apologize and move on. But if this is the only time you've touched a boundary of hers and she lets the negativity drag on, that's on her. \n\nMaybe find a therapist or get a neutral mediator to help you both talk things out and explain that the yelling and door slamming isn't cool.", "NTA, you\u2019re babysitting her, she can babysit for you for an hour.", "NTA but you need to have a serious talk with her. You may not be her parent, but you took her in so she could get away from your abusive parents and had to put yourself out to do so, moving the babies back into your room and paying extra for things like her phone. According to you she has experience babysitting children that young, it wouldn't have killed her to watch your kids in an emergency situation. It's not like you're trying to get her to do it all the time so you can go out and have fun, it was really important. She's 17, not 7, she shouldn't be throwing a tantrum after you practically begged her to do you a single favor. She should be doing more around the house to help you out anyway, she's taking up money and giving you more work to do.", "NTA.\n\nYou are covering all her costs and have your children in your room with you so she can have the second bedroom.\n\nI\u2019m not going to suggest that you send her back to an abusive household, but you need a firm talk about your living situation, expectations and boundaries. Spell out exactly what is expected of her.\n\nGood luck.", "Nta , but bring her ass back by your parents", "NTA it was an emergency and you needed help. She should have been kind and done it. \n\nAlso, if she wants to be treated as an independent roommate- then you need to treat her as a roommate. She needs to be contributing to the household by doing chores or paying rent. A 17 year old should be paying her own phone bill at least", "Nta but this sets the tone she is your 3rd baby almost an adult I\u2019d send her back and focus on my kids. Being a twin parent is hard as is set boundaries", "NTA - your sister sounds very entitled.  It\u2019s completely reasonable to ask a family member to help you out by watching kids for an hour when they are living in your house eating your food and you are paying their expenses.\n\nDoes she have chores?  Letting her stay with no responsibilities is a disservice to both her and you.  She needs to contribute to the household.", "NTA Time to kick her out and send her back to Mommy & Daddy. She made a choice that will have a impact. Like she no longer has free room & board in your home..\n\nYou dont owe her anything.", "NTA - Kick your sister out. Let me be harshly honest with you: Your parents might be overbearing, but they fed, clothed, and put a roof over your heads. She won\u2019t die living with your parents. Maybe it will push her to become independent.\n\nYour sister is a parasite and ungrateful. What value is she adding to your household? Is she paying any of the bills? Is she doing chores? The least she could do was watch your kids for 2 hours. \n\nYou are a 20 year old mother with two kids to raise. That sounds difficult. You don\u2019t need a third kid, do you? It\u2019s not cute that you are trying to keep your life straight and she is no help to you other than being an extra body in your home.\n\nKick her out.", "NTA", "NTA. \n\nShe's overreacting, and freeloading. Kick her out.", "[deleted]", "Nta kick her out", "NTA she can do a little extra for you since you are doing a lot extra for her", "INFO- you\u2019re a single mom of twins, and going to college, and living independently- how are you paying the bills?", "NTA but find something else for her to earn her keep besides watch the babies (in the future). She needs to pitch in but I wouldn\u2019t trust anyone to watch my kids if they told me they didn\u2019t like them.", "NTA She needs to start stepping up and contributing something since she can\u2019t bother to help on the rare moments you ask", "NAH because in the one sentence you described your parents, they sound downright abusive. Your sister is living with you to scape an abusive household, so this isn't a regular \"she just prefers to live with me\" situation. And ideally she wouldn't live with someone who has infant twins when she apparently dislikes babies, but again, this is an extreme case.\n\nShe should have been predisposed to help you out with babysitting, as a way to reciprocate the help you're giving her by offering her free housing and supporting her financially. So she sucks for refusing, but if she has emotional trauma regarding being forced to do things she doesn't want to do, I can understand her digging her heels in. \n\nYou're not an asshole for asking her to babysit during an emergency, but you do kind of suck for expecting her to say yes and push for that answer. You should've respected her saying no, and make decisions about her living situation moving forward, if you so wish.\n\nPersonally, I think none of you are assholes because you genuinely needed someone to watch the babies, and she is being reactive after living with abusive and controlling people for 17 years.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It was an emergency. When it's an emergency, you pitch in and help out. This is different from you expecting her to help raise your kids every day.\n\nYou are not an AH for asking.

It was a reasonable request: it was an emergency situation and you weren't asking her to handle anything she didn't know how to do.

I wouldnt want to be let alone with them, they should not be let with me either...", "Twins are a handful for any adult, even experienced parents can struggle with them. Expecting a 17 year old to be comfortable with babysitting twins is not reasonable.", "Nta . I\u2019d tell sis to pack her bags and hit the road. If you going to live in my house your going to help with everything period", "She doesn't have to watch your children.\n\nYou don't have to support her.\n\nNTA.  If she wants to get the benefits of a family relationship with you, then she needs to step up and hold up her end of the family bargain.  If she wants to treat you like a stranger, then you can treat her like one in return.", "NTA, normally I wouldn\u2019t say this but it was an emergency and you have bent over backwards two times over to accommodate your sister.  She is way too entitled", "NTA, but I also understand her unwillingness to take care of the babies. Generally, it is right thing to do to help out someone, especially someone taking care of you while keeping you out of an abusive household, during an emergency if it is within your ability. Including watching children, even if this is something you are normally opposed to. However, taking care of newborn infants for more than a few minutes is an extremely serious and big responsibility. Babies are so fragile and even if you have experience taking care of children, an infant is a whole other matter. Because of that, I don't think that a 17 year old is in the wrong for refusing in this case (you were able to take them with you, the babies were not put at risk by her not watching them). You're also not in the wrong for asking more than once, because you were clearly stressed out and feeling a bit desperate. The only assholes here are the people in the comments suggesting you send her back to your clearly abusive parents over this. \n\nThat being said, her behaviour in reaction to this situation is not healthy. You should sit down with her and have a conversation about what you were experiencing in that moment, and ask for her own experience. Then, you should talk about how, while you understand that watching your babies is too much to ask, you DO need her to help out more because you're struggling it handle everything yourself. Also, that you need to feel like you're able to count on her in an emergency. Discuss together what are some potential serious situations that could pop up, and what you both can do in those moments to support eachother- including what to avoid, such as what things trigger her experiences with your parents, and what things make you feel like you're not appreciated or respected. This way, you both have a bit of a plan so it doesn't feel like you are throwing expectations on eachother out of the blue, and you both have a better understanding of how your actions affect the other.\n\nAnother topic your should bring up, is that while you're willing and happy to provide her with a place to stay and her needs, it can't be a forever solution because you're being stretched thin as a single mother of twins while also going to school. Tell her she needs to get a job. With her getting a job, you can give her one of two offers- she starts pitching in immediately by giving you some money, OR you continue to pay everything for now, but she MUST put a large percentage (or all) of her money away in savings to get her own place once she finishes school. Unless you can't afford it, tell her you'll take care of her as long as she needs to get onto her own feet after school. Which offer you give depends on your own financial situation and what works best for you, but she DOES need to start contributing in some way, and planning for her own independent future. If she is not helping pay for things, then she also need to be given some household things to help out with. Try to give her the option of choosing what things she help with, and add your own suggestions if she cant think of enough. \nAlso, if this is a possible situation you could see being okay, a third option is that you guys plan to continue living together as roommates, even after she leaves school. In this case, she would be helping pay rent and you guys could look for a bigger apartment so the babies can have their own room again.\n\nGood luck. You both are dealing with working through trauma from your parents, and your own individual current situations as a teen who has to learn to adult faster than usual, and a young and single mom juggling more than you have the hands for.\n\nBe honest, be transparent, and remind both yourself and her to have compassion. You guys will get through this, together.", "NTA, your sister is acting entitled.  Family helps each other.  She has no problem taking your handouts.
