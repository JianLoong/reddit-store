I mean, I get her point that it was out of her control, but she did agree to the trip knowing there was a financial commitment involved. I wouldn't expect the money back though and pressing it will likely lead to fights. Shitty situation all around.", "Half back sounds fair", "NTA, do you really want this kind of drama in your life?", "NTA. It was the last minute, and she pulled an excuse (whether it's valid or not, I'll leave to her psychiatrist).", "NTA, take someone else next time.", "NTA shes using her anxiety against you and you should think carefully about if you want to live like this the rest of your life or not.", "NTA. Managing her anxiety is hers to do, and if she can't do it, then the consequences are also hers to carry. Reimbursing you for half of what her cancellation cost you is a reasonable request.", "strong NTA. you communicated your plans thoroughly with her, she agreed and committed to them, and then she went and ruined them. in all honesty, she wasted your money and guilt tripped you. she needs to learn to manage her anxiety and the consequences that come with it. the biggest shame is that you didn\u2019t go by yourself or with a mate.", "NTA. She\u2019s playing games with you. If she had booked the trip and canceled at the last minute she would have lost the money too. If it happened just as you described it, she should pay you back.", "People can be very weird when it comes to money, so you will get a lot of varied responses. I don\u2019t think you are the AH, but she isn\u2019t either. Just seems like an odd place in your relationship, but this could be a red flag. Going forward you need to be clear about what your expectations are and make sure you both have a good understanding of how you both think about , well, any situation like this.", "NTA - but also not the innocent victim. Also, since when do cocktail bars and restaurants take deposits? They\u2019re assholes too. Also, I would have gone on the trip by myself and had a marvellous time if it was me.", "NTA. You made plans with her anxiety in mind. You gave her time to prepare, you covered your bases by making sure it was somewhere she loves, you didn't surprise someone with anxiety.\n\nTbh I would talk to her about what has her feeling so anxious. While anxiety doesn't always have a source, there IS a lot of pressure around a one year anniversary. Maybe she doesn't have a gift and wants one when you do something special for it. Maybe she was worried you were going to propose (weekend get away, dinner reservations, favorite place, definitely easy to worry what that combo means) and isn't ready for that. We anxiety crew tend to overthink things and go down rabbit holes. I'm not saying this IS the case. It's just a \"these are things she could worry about, but SHE can actually tell you, not the random on the internet\". \n\nI think it's absolutely fair to ask her to help cover the cancelation costs for something she was aware of and on board with. It sucks that she's having a hard time with her anxiety right now, but that doesn't mean that there aren't consequences that you are now dealing with alone. Idk, as someone with anxiety, if mine gets in the way and costs someone money or puts them in a bad spot because i was necessary for plans, I always try to help figure out a solution. I'm responsible for things even if my anxiety is sometimes out of my control.", "NTA\n\nProvided you ran it past her and got a firm committment to go, there is no way that you should cover the financial cost of your girlfriend's anxiety.\n\nYou don't say how you asked her.  Maybe next time take her payment at booking.  If there is a next time...", "NTA \u2018it\u2019s not my fault I have anxiety\u2019 yeah it\u2019s not your boyfriends fault either, have some accountability. Sounds like a major red flag to me, I have anxiety myself but I do not use it as an excuse.\n\nShe sounds like the type to blame any poor behaviour or inconvenience on her anxiety and that makes it oky. It doesn\u2019t. She needs to learn to manage her anxiety herself. It\u2019s not other peoples responsibility", "NTA but you MAY be the AH here depending on how you asked. If she was super anxious and you got upset and said \"give me my money back\" then mabey. Had you had let it sit and then asked her if she can help you out re-coupe the deposit so you can try again and have a nice outing then mabey.", "Nta. And dump her, man. She sounds like drama central.", "\"I have anxiety\" people are the worst. Anyway, if the trip was a gift from you and you always intended to pay, you can sound like an asshole in this situation.", "NTA but are you sure she's the one for you ? She sounds way too high maintenance", "YTA, but what is going on here? If she has anxiety issues meaning she can't go on trips,  you can't book trips, simple as that. If you still book a trip, that's a risk you take.\n\nDoes she have meds for this? If not,  since you are in the UK; she needs to see a doctor about that, right?\n\nShe can't just blame anxiety all the time and not work on it, which we know nothing about.\n\nBut anyways, the trip was a gift from you, you wanting to be reimbursed seems petty as hell. That said, you don't have to be with a person that you can't do fun stuff with.", "NTA she should at least give you half", "NTA\nIs this what you want in a partner? Maybe chalk it up to a 250 lesson", "NTA but I don't think y'all are compatible. This will happen again. Unless you never want to travel with your partner the rest of your life, you need a new one", "YTA If he is not able to use her gift (!) ask if it's okay to go alone/with someone else. But it stays a gift, even if you are not able to use it. If it was a gift for her and not yourself. \n\nIt would be different if she always says last minute that she isn't able to go. And I hope she's working with a pro to find a way to live with her anxiety.", "YTA - if you knew she had anxiety - your plan and manage for that. \n\nIt isn't that hard to book a hotel when you are there and choose a restaurant - why did you have to prepay everything in advance. Was Op trying to add additional pressure on his GF to go with him. \n\nI have done many weekends away and 6 months travelling in a row and only a handful of times booked a hotel ahead.", "I had a boyfriend who would repeatedly sneak up behind me while I was doing the washing up (or hanging clothes or any other busy work). He didn't sneak up behind his sisters, bestie, godson, godson's mum. Just me. The one with ptsd. And he would act shocked & annoyed every time, bc I'd crumble out of fright.\nWHY are you making arrangements, controlling every aspect of an event, for someone with anxiety?\nWHY are you wrapping dominance & abuse in a bow & pretending it's a gift?\nEdit - a lot of entitlement & ableism on display in these responses. A lot of people refusing to understand how disability can work. Including op.", "YTA, and I really hope she takes this big red flag as a sign that she's better off without you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

As a surprise I thought it would be nice to book a weekend away for us. We've been on weekends away before and I know this is a place my girlfriend really wants to go. I made sure she was free on the weekend I had booked and then planned out the weekend.  \n\n\n  \nBefore I paid I made sure to show my gf when I had planned for us to make sure she wanted to do it. She said it seemed amazing and she wanted to do it so I paid for it. I paid for the hotel, train tickets, a deposit for a restaurant and a deposit for a cocktail bar so in total I spend over \u00a3250. It comes to the day of the trip and my gf says she doesn't think she can go. I ask her why and she just says she feels anxious. We talk about it for a bit and she still decided to cancel.\n\n  \nLater that day I mention the money I have lost and tell her I don't mean to sound bad but I expect her to pay me back. She seems shocked and asks if I'm being serious. I say yeah I am since I spent over \u00a3250 to do something nice for her only for her to cancel at pretty much the last possible minute and mean that the money is wasted.\n\n  \nShe said I'm using her anxiety against her. I point out I'm not holing it against her but if your actions cost someone else money then you should reimburse them. She just repeated that it's not her fault she has anxiety and that I'm being unfair by bringing it up and making her feel more guilty. AITA for asking ot be reimbursed for money I had lost?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "NTA. She pulled out unreasonably, imho, so she should reimburse you.", "NTA", "NTA you should have still gone and taken a mate rather than waste the money\nEven go alone and let her have some *space to calm her nerves*", "Info: when you say you have done trips in the past were they split 50/50? Who paid? It sounds like a gift the way you explain it so I think it would depend on what the expectations were going into the getaway.", "NTA\n\nI'm an anxious person, and at least, if it was me, I would have had the anxiety immediately when we were scheduling. Not necessarily saying she's lying, but at the very least she would have known ahead of time this was a possibility/likely and should have just declined the trip immediately. I'd have offered to pay back a portion if I cancelled last minute too though.\n\nSounds to me like she just didn't feel like it the day of and is making excuses. It just doesn't add up IMO.", "NTA  had you booked it all as a surprise, then yeah, take the loss, but you didn't. You showed her the plan, and she agreed. She should have already offered to pay you back tbh. It's not on you to lose that much money when she's the one that cancelled, knowing you'd put deposits on everything.  I'd have still gone either on my own or with a friend. IF you decide to book anywhere else and she cancels inform her there and then, yes, we can cancel, but I want the money back, since it's last minute, and I'm going to lose x amount.", "NTA she owes you.", "NTA she should at least give half the cost back.", "I'd get her to reimburse you for her transport fairs and simply go by yourself. It'll be a nice holiday for you and a chance to really contemplate whether you want to be with someone with such crippling anxiety.   \n\n\nIn future be sure to be upfront about costs and expectations should she cancel plans otherwise, if you like the relationship I would let it go. Arguing over finances will strain your relationship. You need to ask yourself how much your relationship is worth to you?  Best place to ask yourself is in a swanky hotel with an open bar.", "NTA but consider carefully if this kind of high maintenance person is really who you want in your life. Also next time just take someone else, then she can have that to be mad about instead but at least you\u2019ll have had an enjoyable experience.", "NTA. But in the future you know you can\u2019t make plans with her where you have to spend money up front.", "Why didn\u2019t you still go? If she asked you not to go at all. Then asking half back is fine.  If you could still of gone  with a buddy and made it a guys weekend then no you should not of.\n\nOn a side note she is breaking up with you. That\u2019s my bet off what you shared.", "NTA. She isn't responsible for feeling anxious. Everyone can lose control of how they feel sometimes. But we are still responsible and accountable for the decision we make. What kind of entitled BS reasoning is it to bail on someone and act like they couldn't either face their anxiety or cough up half of the expenses to make it right.\n\nNext time bring a friend.", "NTA\n\nGet a new GF", "Her psychiatrist is either going to just prescribe medication or if the psychiatrist/she's willing to they would do CBT to help her adjust to life.", "Exactly this, NTA. I have anxiety and if/when it\u2019s bad enough to prevent me leaving the house I apply measures like not planning an expensive trip that can\u2019t be cancelled last minute.", "I agree.  Call it tuition and move forward... either together or apart.", "Anxiety is a very real problem to deal with and I don\u2019t think somebody who doesn\u2019t understand the severity of the issue should be brushing it off like it\u2019s not a big deal.\n\nThat being said, the responsibility of handling your anxiety is yours only. Nobody should be financially accountable for your last minute cancellations (unless like you mentioned, it was supposed to be a gift or something). Mental illnesses can be tough to deal with but upholding a sense of accountability is very important inorder to not strain your relationship with the people you.", "Did you even read the post? Op stated they had been on weekends away together, and he informed her of his plans prior to paying/booking. Try reading before judging. NTA", "She is on meds and we've been on trips previously.", "We've been on plenty of trips previously. Booking a hotel when we're there will cost over 3x the amount you pay by prebooking it. \n\nIt says a lot about you that you see someone book a nice surprise for their partner and immediately  think I'm pressuring her. Do you not believe in doing nice things for people? Have you always been this paranoid?", "It costs so much more to book while you're there, if you can even get a room somewhere you want to stay. This is the reason you book ahead", "Being organised often helps relieve the anxiety, as you know what to expect, you're not blindsided, there no pressure to make quick decisions. If I arrived somewhere and my partner kept walking into different hotels asking if they had room, I'd freak out panicking, where are we going to sleep, what if we have to sleep on the street, what if the only room is way over budget and we then don't have money to spend on things during the trip, what if the only place is a really bad area, can you trust the locks and things.", "But... he asked her before he booked the trip. He made sure it was somewhere she wanted to go, and something she wanted to do. How is that \"dominance and abuse\"?\n\nIf she wasn't sure this was something she could commit to, the time to tell him that was before he booked, not after.", "I swear people like you make everything a personal attack against them.", "Is your asshole okay with how far you reached up there to grab this take?\n\nPost: \u201cbefore booking I made sure it was something she would like and verified it with her. She said it seemed amazing, let\u2019s do it.\u201d\n\nYou: \u201cwhy are you making arrangements her and forcing her to do things.\u201d", "So you think booking a nice weekend for your partner is abusive? That's hilarious. Do you not believe in doing nice things for others?\n\nWhy am I making arrangements? To do something nice for my partner. Something you clearly know absolutely nothing about.\n\nPlease explain how planning a nice surprise for my partner is abusive. I can't wait for whatever bullshit you come up with\n\nedit: and did you just decide to deliberately ignore the part of the post when I mention the trip to my gf and ask her if she wanted to do it?", "I dont get this. This was a place she really wanted to go too, he checked she had the weekend free, booked everything and then re checked with her before paying and finalising the plan. He was trying to do something nice for her. So how is that abuse? I dont know how bad her anxiety is but she cancelled on him at the last minute. Sure, he's not going to get that money back but he should chalk this up to a lesson learnt.", "how is any of that relevant at all???? she literally agreed to every step of it and cancelled on the last minute, which he also obliged to. that\u2019s not him being controlling whatsoever lol", "Calling this 'dominance and abuse' is a lot. Could be your experiences are affecting your judgement", "How is it a red flag to not want to lose money?", "So you live in your Mom's basement ?", "They have been on weekends, buts not clear who paid. Is he charging her only because of the cancellation?", "Not paranoid. \n\nI have found hotels are generally cheaper as they get closer to the date as they have less time to sell that room, you also get the option to see what the hotel / local area is like. \n\nNone of my weekends away have ended up with a domestic and having to go to the Internet to check if I Was an Asshole or not :)", "I have found the opposite (and done it hundreds of times) - show up they have vacant rooms and very little chance to sell them in the next few hours. You also get to see what the hotel is like rather than trusting their photo's description. \n\nWe have only once had any problems with this approach, and it was when several airlines went on strike, so all the nearby hotels were full, we arrived at the airport at 10 pm and had a 6 am flight out - so we just stayed at the airport overnight.", "They could have sat in a coffee shop / bar and looked at lastminute . com or other last minute hotel sites. They could have gone for a walk along the beach and dropped into a hotel for a beer / snack - and seen what the hotel is like and asked them.", "It's not. Someone who doesn't care about your money is though.", "It's a red flag that you decided AFTER the fact that you wanted money from her, for things that YOU wanted and paid for.\n\nYou lost some money, big deal, grow up.", "I'm guessing you're not always staying where you want then, or travelling during peak times of year", "Why should he be the one to lose money when he's not the one who cancelled it?", "I decided after it got cancelled yeah. How could I decide beforehand if I didn't know she was going to cancel?\n\nWhy exactly do I need to grow up because I don't expect to lose money?", "We don't have school kids - so can easily avoid all the peak periods. We used to go travelling for months in a row, and would plan on being somewhere that wouldn't be popular with kids for the peak times. \n\nThere are not set hotels that we want to particularly stay at - and this way we have had some amazing hotels as we didn't know about it. Sometimes hotels that we saw in brochures that looked amazing in the brochure were crap when we walked past them.", "He could have gone alone and it would have cost the same amount of money. Its not considered a gift if you expect to be paid back.", "Life happens. You take these kinds of risks when you book and pay for things that are non-refundable.\n\nHonestly, quit whining and act like an adult.", "Yeah I'm sure she would have been over the moon if he was like \"ok cool you don't wanna come? See you in a few days bye\"", "So despite the fact that she agreed to the trip and the apparent itinerary, prompting him to pay and book etc. She then cancels last minute and he needs to stop whinging?  She needs to take some responsibility in this tbh.", "So you think being an adult mean just letting people cost you money?\n\nIf someone agreed to something and then pulls out and costs you money, you think being an adult means just accepting it? Have you always been spineless?", "But nothing actually happened, she just flaked. If she were to act like an adult, she'd not date until she had her mental health issues sorted out."]}
