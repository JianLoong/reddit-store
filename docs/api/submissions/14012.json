My stepdaughter, Jamie (19F) lives at home with us. We generally all have very peaceful, loving relationships with each other and very few disagreements so them both being annoyed with me is very upsetting.\n\nI've always done the vast majority of the cooking because it just made sense - my work has been remote since long before the pandemic, I'm an excellent cook and I legitimately enjoy being in the kitchen. Abe and Jamie are both pickyish eaters. It's not terrible; they're not like pizza-only people but they dislike a lot of types of cuisine. They've been open to enough foods though that accommodating them is fairly simple. I, on the other hand, *love* new foods and have a very adventurous palate. I tried in the beginning of the relationship to add new things to my dishes but I quickly learned they weren't going to eat it so I stuck to more basic meals and we compromised on take out nights. Once or twice a week, I'd get takeout from somewhere they'd never consider trying and they'd get themselves pizza or subs or something like that. It worked well for years.\n\nI was diagnosed with celiac disease last year and most of my favorite places are CC nightmares and the GF places in my city were disappointing so takeout night is over for me.\n\nLately, I've been cooking meals I know they won't like at roughly the same rate as our old takeout nights (1-2 a week) which has upset them both. I don't see any reason they can't continue getting themselves takeout on those nights or just make themselves something. They're both adults. But they both feel that me excluding 2/3 of the home to cater to myself is selfish and rude and that I have changed a dynamic that has stood for 6+ years with little warning. They want me to consider cooking them a separate meal on those nights but I don't want to. I've offered to teach Jamie to cook again (she's never been interested) but she says \"that's not the point\" and then doesn't elaborate on what her point actually. My husband agrees and keeps telling me that I'm not acting like a member of a family by only considering myself.", "created_utc": 1680645300, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12by1a5/aita_for_cooking_food_i_like_instead_of_cooking/", "score": 168, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

So instead of takeout, I make myself something I can enjoy.  You're free to do whatever you want on those nights, the same as you've always done, but to insist I cook for your tastes and ignore my own 7 days a week because to do otherwise is 'unfair' is hypocritical at best and downright mean at worst.

You aren't their short-order cook.", "NTA like u said, they can continue to get takeout like they did in the past, or cook for themselves. Not that hard!", "NTA. It's unreasonable for your husband and adult daughter to expect you to cook an entirely separate meal for them on nights you are trying out celiac friendly meals for yourself. Either you can make some extra for them , or they can order their own takeout.", "NTA, it's all been said already, but they're being selfish and difficult.

It's only once or twice a week, and you've offered ways to compromise. If they aren't willing to accept your compromises, that's on them.

This is an additional burden to bear. Time to adjust the cooking dynamics. 7 days in a week. 3 adults. Everyone cooks for the family 2x per week. Sundays are \u201cfend for yourselves \u201c. Each person creates their own meal plan. Stick to it. Don\u2019t give in. From personal experience this shuts them up quickly.", "NTA\n\nI don't understand, what would be the problem here. You have a medical condition, that no longer makes the takeout nights enjoyable, so of course you should be able to enjoy the food you like, it's not like you force them to make the food for you.

You've been generously doing all of the cooking for years, and there's no reason why the two of them can't cook.", "NTA. They seem to forget that your diagnosis was without warning to you asell.

It may not be intentional, but they're being incredibly selfish. They should understand that this is your replacement for take out nights, and their ignorance is appalling. They already were used to take out at the same frequency, literally nothing has changed for them. They're actually unfairly putting more on you and changing YOUR dynamic while they get to sit and do fuckall. If they want separate homemade meals they can do it themselves or go without.

There\u2019s 7 nights in a week, plenty of nights to rotate meals so you can all be satisfied if need be. \n\nRegardless, I would not be complaining about a meal that someone else took the time to make me.

They can either cook for themselves or order take out like before. \n\nNext time they complain, ask them if they have a medical condition that is preventing them from cooking or ordering food. Offer to make Doctor appointments to get them checked over. Even better, just start dialing the clinic and make the appointment right then. Cus this is THEIR PROBLEM not yours.", "You haven't changed their dynamic at all. They can continue as they have been (get a takeaway) or eat what you want to cook. NTA", "NTA. But I suggest throwing dino nugs in the oven on those nights and maybe a frozen mac and cheese too.

I could see why it is unfair to the people who dont/can\u2019t cook. HOWEVER, food is food, no? The only way this can be a problem is if everyone is the pickiest eater in the damn world. As long as you\u2019re putting protein, grains, vegetables, and dairy on the table (it all varies, diet is complicated) - then you\u2019re doing your part to nutritionally support them. If they don\u2019t appreciate that, tell them to get a clue", "NAH. You're not doing anything wrong, and while it sounds like they've blown things out of proportion, I can understand the mindset they're coming from. It sounds like previously everyone was ordering takeout together, it was just from 2 different places, but it was still a family meal. Now, you're just making yourself dinner and equating it to takeout night, but it doesn't feel like that to them. It feels like you're intentionally leaving them out. IDK if you can have a conversation about this that they will accept currently, it depends on how deeply their convictions run, but you'll have to have that conversation in order for them to see past their current (seemingly incorrect) opinions.", "NTA, \"they're adults.\" You don't even have to cook for them.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Shame on them because any decent person would understand and be empathetic \u2014 this is a tiny accommodation to ask for. Personally, I think that the only way to get them to behave better is to ask to redistribute the chores. You take on some more cleaning and then everyone cooks for themselves.

Sometimes we (as humans) read a situation the wrong way and form the wrong opinion. It can be really hard to shake that, and as this is a recent change to a 6-year cycle, I can understand the thought process that went into it.

My mom has dietary restrictions, my dad and I had to give up quite a few things we like because she can\u2019t eat them. So now we only eat them when she\u2019s out of the house or alongside something she likes that we don\u2019t. If they want you to have something special then they could *make it for you*.", "That\u2019s just ridiculous. NTA", "Well, if it bothers them that much, I think they should either cook dinner for all of you, or find you a nice GF takeout place that doesn't suck so you can have takeout again. Sounds like if they have enough time to bitch about it, they have time to do something to change it.", "In my house this would have been a treat growing up. No way we would have given that up!", "My answer would be \u201ctoo fucking bad\u201d. Tell them not being able to eat takeout without getting diarrhea isn\u2019t exactly a walk in the park for you, so they can just deal with their feelings. \n\nI say this as a person who\u2019s been diagnosed with celiac for 25 years.  I know of what I speak", "So they eat kid's menu foods.", "Jeez, I'm autistic af and I eat less restrictively than that.", "Jeez. What do they eat?", "I really appreciate this comment, thank you. Family culture was exactly the term I've been trying to come up with in my head", "Yep. OP is having to make a huge and, frankly limiting, adjustment to her life. I\u2019m astonished by the lack of empathy from her immediate family"]}
