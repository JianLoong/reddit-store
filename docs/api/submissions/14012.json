My stepdaughter, Jamie (19F) lives at home with us. We generally all have very peaceful, loving relationships with each other and very few disagreements so them both being annoyed with me is very upsetting.\n\nI've always done the vast majority of the cooking because it just made sense - my work has been remote since long before the pandemic, I'm an excellent cook and I legitimately enjoy being in the kitchen. Abe and Jamie are both pickyish eaters. It's not terrible; they're not like pizza-only people but they dislike a lot of types of cuisine. They've been open to enough foods though that accommodating them is fairly simple. I, on the other hand, *love* new foods and have a very adventurous palate. I tried in the beginning of the relationship to add new things to my dishes but I quickly learned they weren't going to eat it so I stuck to more basic meals and we compromised on take out nights. Once or twice a week, I'd get takeout from somewhere they'd never consider trying and they'd get themselves pizza or subs or something like that. It worked well for years.\n\nI was diagnosed with celiac disease last year and most of my favorite places are CC nightmares and the GF places in my city were disappointing so takeout night is over for me.\n\nLately, I've been cooking meals I know they won't like at roughly the same rate as our old takeout nights (1-2 a week) which has upset them both. I don't see any reason they can't continue getting themselves takeout on those nights or just make themselves something. They're both adults. But they both feel that me excluding 2/3 of the home to cater to myself is selfish and rude and that I have changed a dynamic that has stood for 6+ years with little warning. They want me to consider cooking them a separate meal on those nights but I don't want to. I've offered to teach Jamie to cook again (she's never been interested) but she says \"that's not the point\" and then doesn't elaborate on what her point actually. My husband agrees and keeps telling me that I'm not acting like a member of a family by only considering myself.", "created_utc": 1680645300, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12by1a5/aita_for_cooking_food_i_like_instead_of_cooking/", "score": 369, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

So instead of takeout, I make myself something I can enjoy.  You're free to do whatever you want on those nights, the same as you've always done, but to insist I cook for your tastes and ignore my own 7 days a week because to do otherwise is 'unfair' is hypocritical at best and downright mean at worst.

It's unreasonable for your husband and adult daughter to expect you to cook an entirely separate meal for them on nights you are trying out celiac friendly meals for yourself. Either you can make some extra for them , or they can order their own takeout.", "NTA, it's all been said already, but they're being selfish and difficult.

This is an additional burden to bear. Time to adjust the cooking dynamics. 7 days in a week. 3 adults. Everyone cooks for the family 2x per week. Sundays are \u201cfend for yourselves \u201c. Each person creates their own meal plan. Stick to it. Don\u2019t give in. From personal experience this shuts them up quickly.", "NTA\n\nI don't understand, what would be the problem here.

It may not be intentional, but they're being incredibly selfish. They should understand that this is your replacement for take out nights, and their ignorance is appalling. They already were used to take out at the same frequency, literally nothing has changed for them. They're actually unfairly putting more on you and changing YOUR dynamic while they get to sit and do fuckall. If they want separate homemade meals they can do it themselves or go without.

There\u2019s 7 nights in a week, plenty of nights to rotate meals so you can all be satisfied if need be. \n\nRegardless, I would not be complaining about a meal that someone else took the time to make me.

Cus this is THEIR PROBLEM not yours.", "You haven't changed their dynamic at all. They can continue as they have been (get a takeaway) or eat what you want to cook. NTA", "NTA.

I could see why it is unfair to the people who dont/can\u2019t cook. HOWEVER, food is food, no? The only way this can be a problem is if everyone is the pickiest eater in the damn world. As long as you\u2019re putting protein, grains, vegetables, and dairy on the table (it all varies, diet is complicated) - then you\u2019re doing your part to nutritionally support them. If they don\u2019t appreciate that, tell them to get a clue", "NAH. You're not doing anything wrong, and while it sounds like they've blown things out of proportion, I can understand the mindset they're coming from. It sounds like previously everyone was ordering takeout together, it was just from 2 different places, but it was still a family meal. Now, you're just making yourself dinner and equating it to takeout night, but it doesn't feel like that to them. It feels like you're intentionally leaving them out. IDK if you can have a conversation about this that they will accept currently, it depends on how deeply their convictions run, but you'll have to have that conversation in order for them to see past their current (seemingly incorrect) opinions.", "NTA, \"they're adults.\" You don't even have to cook for them.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Personally, I think that the only way to get them to behave better is to ask to redistribute the chores. You take on some more cleaning and then everyone cooks for themselves.

Sometimes we (as humans) read a situation the wrong way and form the wrong opinion. It can be really hard to shake that, and as this is a recent change to a 6-year cycle, I can understand the thought process that went into it.

If they want you to have something special then they could *make it for you*.", "That\u2019s just ridiculous. NTA", "Well, if it bothers them that much, I think they should either cook dinner for all of you, or find you a nice GF takeout place that doesn't suck so you can have takeout again. Sounds like if they have enough time to bitch about it, they have time to do something to change it.", "In my house this would have been a treat growing up. No way we would have given that up!", "My answer would be \u201ctoo fucking bad\u201d. Tell them not being able to eat takeout without getting diarrhea isn\u2019t exactly a walk in the park for you, so they can just deal with their feelings. \n\nI say this as a person who\u2019s been diagnosed with celiac for 25 years.  I know of what I speak", "So they eat kid's menu foods.", "Jeez, I'm autistic af and I eat less restrictively than that.", "Jeez. What do they eat?", "I really appreciate this comment, thank you. Family culture was exactly the term I've been trying to come up with in my head", "Yep. OP is having to make a huge and, frankly limiting, adjustment to her life. I\u2019m astonished by the lack of empathy from her immediate family", "NTA - I do have to note that there are times that my family discusses getting takeout and then my mom goes ahead and cooks a ton of food so it doesn\u2019t make sense for us to order. It seems wrong to order food when there\u2019s a whole bunch of fresh food at home. Maybe just cook enough for yourself?", "NTA. they aren't going to starve themselves; u have already provided alternatives. Cook what u want. They will learn to survive... they just haven't reached there yet because they still think u will bend to their will.", "NTA. They\u2019re being super whiny and selfish. You\u2019re not required to cook for them. It\u2019s lovely that you do, and even lovelier that you try to take their tastes into account, but if you cook something and they decide for whatever reason that they\u2019re not gonna eat it, that\u2019s on them. They need to sort out their own food at that point. If someone makes me food and I can eat it without being sick (I am gluten and lactose intolerant) I do it with a smile, say thank you, and clean up the kitchen afterwards. \nBut I am extremely picky so I do all the cooking at my house.", "NTA. This is a health issue - not a \u201cI just decided to avoid gluten\u201d thing.  Your husband and stepdaughter are being unbelievably SELFISH for only thinking of themselves.", "NTA Tell them they can cook or eat PBJs. It's incredibly entitled and selfish to expect the chef to cook two different dishes for the same meal. Time for them to youtube how to cook or start eating like adults.", "NTA - This is a serious medical condition I work in a GF bakery we sell lovely high-end foods. They do realise that even handling gluten can trigger you! They are adults who can  either eat what you cook, order takeout or cook for themselves is not a huge ask twice a week they are selfish and not listening to your needs. It is a huge learning curve to accommodate a GF lifestyle I wish you good luck", "This pisses me off. My mum is allergic to a lot of foods. Cheese, chocolate, MSG, most oils and salts all make her sick for days on end. We don\u2019t force her to cook two meals every night so that we can have what we like and she can have what she needs to be able to stay healthy. This is just ridiculous standards. For years when we go out to eat or have \u201ctake out nights\u201d my mum has always cooked something small that she can eat while we got our take out meals without it being any less special to the family. They need to learn to cook for themselves if they feel so indifferent about having take out while you eat home cooked meals. They\u2019re mad that you\u2019ve \u201cchanged the dynamic\u201d? Would they rather you be sick all the time just so they get to keep their beloved dynamic?\n\nEdit to add judgment: NTA", "NTA. \u201cWith very little warning\u201d ummmm how exactly do they think you could\u2019ve given more warning when this is literally because of a recent medical diagnosis?!? How are they not at all considering how hard it is to have to cut out all gluten for you?! They say you\u2019re only considering yourself, well fine maybe you should show them what that would ACTUALLY look like and stop cooking anything for them altogether. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f They\u2019re both full grown freaking adults.", "NTA - If the nice advice below doesn't work, I suggest crying whenever they try badgering you.  Cry about how now you can't eat our any more, how they are making you feel worse,  have no empathy, and demanding a sick woman do extra work and cook for everyone.\n\nYou should also be so distraught you cook for nobody (or yourself only).  Rinse and repeat, doing nothing for them until they realize they are assholes and you are not a maid/cook.", "Since you need to get GF, why don't you alternate between cooking your meal, and getting take out for everyone from one of the GF restaurants?\n\nDo they want to eat what you're eating, and maybe feel left out?\n\nFrankly my family is pack of wolves, and they wouldn't notice what other people were eating unless they ran out of food and were still hungry.", "What about getting some takeout containers to put your food in? You can get some in bulk, cook up your food, put it in there and they can get their usual takeout? It might be fun for you as well, give you a little bit back of what celiac took from you on those nights.", "NTA", "They're both capable if doing their own cooking or ordering takeout. NTA", "NTA. Buy a case of ramen from Costco and next time they complain about you cooking you can drop it in the counter, although I\u2019d probably toss it at their head. We have celiac in our house and you know what my husband did? He bought gluten free flours and made homemade pizza for all of us.", "Oy.  NTA.  Change the name to \"Everyone fends for themselves night\" and make yourself something nice and interesting and let them do what they want.  If they don't want pizza they can make themselves peanut butter and jelly sandwiches or a can of soup.  Their attitude is annoying.   How about they cook something you'll like a couple times a week if they think cooking something you don't want for others is so simple and easy that you should do it for the entire eternity of these relationships.", "NTA and ask him are they acting like members of the family. You are also a member of the family and your needs should be considered. It's not you they are acting selfish.", "NTA. I\u2019m so sorry. This has my blood boiling. They\u2019re being manipulative and immature. Like you said, they\u2019re perfectly capable of continuing to order out for the nights you cook for yourself. That would keep the dynamic literally the same as it was for the 6+ years. Absolutely nothing has to change. Why do they care what you eat on days they\u2019d be eating out anyway? This makes no sense. \nWould show them these so they can see how ridiculous and incapable they are.", "NTA. If they don\u2019t like it then they can cook for themselves. You\u2019re doing this for medical reasons. They need to get over it. You should be making all of your meals gf. You\u2019re already compromising so much.", "NTA\n\nIf they can't be arsed to order or cook themselves, since you do this now because you have an official diagnosis, they can starve themselves and I wouldn't bat an eyelash. They're old enough. Again, you have a medical condition where you need certain foods. If they really cared, they'd cook their own darn food and would help out.", "NTA if you\u2019re going to be picky you\u2019re going to have to get your own food. They\u2019re both adults and are being very selfish.  Celiac disease is a big deal, you\u2019ve got enough on your plate (pun intended).", "I would stop cooking period. They\u2019re both old enough to feed themselves", "I\u2026you got diagnosed with an autoimmune disorder\u2026\n\n\u201cChanging the dynamic\u201d the dynamic of your BODY changed, Celiac is SUCH a huge upheaval and they\u2019re worried about differences between take out and home cooked meals?????\n\nI am angry on your behalf and I hope you get angry on your behalf too cause that\u2019s just super messed up", "So what do they want? You starving yourself on takeout nights or worse, eating whatever they order and you suffer the consequences...\n\nIf they are so adamant on them also having home cooked meal on those days then, start a new tradition, make them participate cooking on those days as well so all 3 of you have a \"cooking night\". If they are not interested, then let them figure out their own food on takeout nights.", "NTA they are being super insensitive. I remember the first 6-12 months of being gluten free as being awful, I felt so deprived and resented the inconvenience of everything so much, especially managing cross contamination in a shared kitchen. It\u2019s still hard 15 years on. \n\nThey are bitching about you \u2018changing the dynamic\u2019 when your life has been so significantly impacted by celiac. You are catering to their tastes on 5/7 dinners, and to your own for 2/7 dinners when they are free to get takeaway. They are already getting over-catered to, they are just too selfish to see it.\n\nIn your shoes I would be tempted to just shift to only making things you like. They can fend for themselves for a bit and see if they can find a bit of gratitude. Buy them a starter cookbook and wish them luck.", "Your way of indulging yourself has changed due to a medical condition, so you've found another way to have the food you prefer. Your husband and step-daughter seem to be saying that they deserve to be indulged, by you, in their food preferences every day with no regard for your needs. Not exactly family friendly behaviour from them. Is it majority rules in your household?\n\n\nNTA and asking you to cook separate meals for them is ridiculous! Would they put in that much extra effort for you?", "Info: why cook for them at all if they're ungrateful and don't care about your comfort/ time? They expect you to cook two meals or not get to eat anything you like after years of you eating the majority of meals THAT YOU COOK to their preferences. Honestly you've created two ungrateful and whiny adults who won't appreciate you pr support you through your illness until they realize the work you put in to cook them meals.", "NTA. They\u2019re adults. They can cook their own damn meals", "That's not nice or fair of them. They are being massively entitled.", "So they can make it special by learning to cook meals you like. They don\u2019t have to eat them, they just have to cook them and do it well for you. Since that\u2019s what you\u2019ve been doing the whole time you\u2019ve known them.\n\nNTA you are married to a very self centered man whose raised a self centered daughter. \nYou are not their cook.", "I'd make my food and eat it out of a takeout container (like the reusable plastic ones). I just enjoy takeout nights though, and there's something special(?) I guess about eating out of the container.", "Maybe silly, but can you present your meals in bento boxes or things like that so they feel like take-out? Privilege finger foods? Prepare them in advance so they don't see you cooking, you just have to re-heat them?\n\nWhile you are NTA, I can understand them being sad that a fun tradition has changed. They are absolutely terrible at communicating about it though. Besides, I \\*hope\\* they are not blaming you for being sick or, even worse, that they're not the type of people who believe that coeliac disease is a fad and nobody's really sick with it..."]}
