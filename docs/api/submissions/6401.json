She can cook her meal the next day.", "NTA! You pull your weight and if you don't feel like cooking, so be it. She wanted comfort food, which is fine and sucks when you can't get it but you did bring her food!! The dish she always gets and dessert too.", "NTA.  Apparently she was up for cooking after all.  Unless she specifically said that she wanted you to cook the meal she was planning,  you did nothing wrong.  You're not a mind reader.", "NTA and that was an ungrateful move on your wife. You worked hard and were tired and you still picked up dinner and plated it for her. Childish move in her part to not eat it. It is not like the meal she planned for that night couldn\u2019t wait until tomorrow!! Sorry OP NTA and if you were my husband you would\u2019ve gotten a big thank you and a kiss !!", "As long as food got there I don't see why it matters how. If you guys were short on money then yes I get it but that doesn't seem to be a issue", "NTA. You handled dinner and you did it thoughtfully", "NTA - this wasn't a planned thing, she was unexpectedly not feeling well and you made it work without complaint after working a long day. You got nice food and picked a perfectly reasonable meal for her. \n\nI have some...strong food preferences. I can see myself ending up in a situation like your wife and my husband handling it like you and me feeling disappointed to not get the food I was expecting. Depending on how I was feeling I'd either suck it up and eat what my husband got, or I'd thank him but say I was really looking forward to what we'd planned and I was willing to make it myself and I'd eat the meal he bought for me later. Either way though, it would be unreasonable for me to be upset with my husband for handling dinner!", "NTA\n\nYou handled dinner. If she wanted something specific, she should have said something before.", "NTA, you did a sweet thing and got chastised for it. I'd love it if my husband did it and you can eat the other the next day.", "OP=nta\n\nBecause you did HANDLE it--you bought dinner.  After 14 hours, she should understand you were tired(even if it wasn't moving heavy crap).\n\nSnips sometimes fail--have you had checkup to see if you are still revving at zero?", "NTA everyone gets a break sometimes.", "NTA you didn\u2019t say you would cook. You said you would take care of dinner. The time to tell you she had a specific meal in mind was when she asked you to handle dinner.", "I think she is feeling salty about something else and that\u2019s why you are in the doghouse", "Totally. I am the queen of cook-from-scratch, and some nights I make my husband order pizza because I\u2019m too exhausted to plan a takeout order. Everyone gets a night off sometimes.", "A very important point. Did a bunch of food get wasted? Or can you just put it in the fridge and cook it tomorrow?", "No we don't have children together. We have a food budget for meals and groceries but eating out comes out of whoever suggested it's personal spending money. So I paid for it out of my extra cash. She didn't say anything about what she wanted to cook until I was already home.", "Nor did shd tell him she was sitting out food to cook.", "Or maybe , just maybe when he called she could have answered or called back ?", "Fried liver and onions? 1000% NTA.", "That\u2019s good! Glad to hear you\u2019re on top of your follow ups. You may want to edit your main post to include this info because of how many people are thinking that direction.", "OP does she normally respond like this when not feeling well?", "Not with headache/body aches kind of not feeling well, no.", "Your saying she doesn't act like this with headache/body aches makes it sound like she does act this way other times when she's not feeling well, is that correct or did I misunderstand?", "x that place off as a go to.. is she normally like this ?", "Nta. She doesn't get to tell you what to do and how to do it. I also work blue collar and if I worked a 14 hr day there is no fcking way I'm cooking.", "NTA here - you wife \"Yesterday afternoon my wife text me to tell me she wasn't feeling well and she wasn't up for cooking and asked if I could handle dinner. Told her no problem\"\n\nDid you not provide dinner by buying food?? Yes\n\nCould she not cook what was planned last night for tonight?? Probably yes \n\nDid she Implicitly ask you to cook the food she had planned? NOPE", "NTA, She's nit-picking.", "NTA, she should have just said thank you instead of pitching a fit.", "NTA.\n\nShe might be upset that you're working such long hours instead of spending time with your family.  The takeout dinner may be a symbol of you not being home early enough.\n\nYes, she should be adult enough to say what's actually bothering her, but it's possible that she doesn't realize the meal isn't the actual issue.", "NTA - She asked you to handle dinner and you did that by going out to get something when you didn't have time to cook. Did she specifically say you have to make the meal I want? The only way I can see maybe her being mad is that when it comes to your turn to cooking, you always run to takeout..not everyone wants takeout for every meal plus money costs ... but that doesn't sound like what going on here.", "NTA she\u2019s being a bit of a baby about it. Maybe because she didn\u2019t feel well, but her behavior is super not cool.", "NTA. You were very thoughtful.", "NTA. This exact situation has happened between my husband and I before, and sometimes I\u2019m not in the mood for takeout, especially if we have a home cooked meal planned. However, I also work a physically demanding job with frequent 13 hour shifts and I don\u2019t cook after work because I\u2019m exhausted and my husband handles it, he never expects me to cook after work. You offered a very nice alternative and she was being a brat about it.", "NTA you tried to give her a heads up and she was unavailable so you made a decision based on the circumstances. You didn\u2019t know she really wanted what was planned and you didn\u2019t flake", "NTA but maybe something else is going on with her. When I\u2019m hyper focused on my weight/body I can be super strict with what I eat and any diversion can feel super stressful. You did a nice thing but it sounds like it triggered something in her.", "NTA. But your wife is. If she was able to cook anyways, she wasn't that unwell. And just feeling a little lousy is no excuse to ask your partner to cook after a 14 hour shift of a physical job. I can't imagine how exhausted you were. She sounds very selfish.", "NTA. You were kind and thoughtful. She\u2019s lucky to have someone like you.", "W: I don't want to cook\nH: all good sweetie\n\nHusband brings home lovely Italian not taco bell. \n\nW: you're a dick. I had a craving for the meal I could have made earlier\n\nAlright then.", "SOMEONE DOWNVOTED MY LOVE OF ITALIAN FOOD COME OUT AND FIGHT ME", "The amount of people on this post assuming because a woman doesn't feel good, she simply must be pregnant is ridiculous.", "If he actually knows her fave dish this dinner is actually extremely thoughtful! \n\n(My husband knows I love Italian food but to him it\u2019s all pasta \ud83d\ude02)", "Is she always this inflexible?  Dinner happens every day, it seems odd that a grown-up would be this fixated on eating this one dish for dinner but not bother to tell you that or make it herself. And then make a fuss about not getting exactly what she wanted.  Is it possible she was setting you up? Like, she was looking for an excuse to be mad at you about how much you cook?", "It also sounds like covid and occasionally, my period.", "NTA you had me at dessert....unless you brought a dessert home she hates.", "NTA. You did ask. But she was clearly in a bad mood and wanted what she wanted. If you\u2019d made the liver and onions yourself, I bet it would\u2019ve been \u201cwrong\u201d.  This was not her day. Lol.", "NTA. You ended up working late and would've made dinner even later. This was a good compromise, I don't understand why your wife couldn't just wait until the next day (especially when she had no problem making it for herself at 9pm).", "NTA.  And\u2026I love you", "NTA \n\nShe obviously wasn\u2019t too sick to cook!", "NTA your wife sounds hollow, entitled after working 14 hours day. Try to get you to cook and get mad at you for getting takeout instead", " NTA She sounds like a little princess.", "NTA. Your actions were perfectly reasonable.", "Dude, if my husband brought me home Italian food and dessert from a place I liked, I would be psyched. Usually when I flake on dinner, he comes home with frozen pizza. Which I also don\u2019t mind, honestly! I am the one who shops and cooks as I only work part-time, while my husband works long hours, so I feel like it\u2019s a kind of similar situation. Your wife sounds hella picky to me.", "NTA I'd love for my husband to bring  dinner home.", "NTA. She sounds insufferable AF.", "You are awesome! You did a very thoughtful dinner! She\u2019s not feeling well and didn\u2019t appreciate it, I think she was a bit AH, but give her a pass bc she was sick. NTA!", "NTA sounds like she had a bad day my friend", "I can see by the downvotes I may have asked an inappropriate question?  Apologies if I offended.  I was just trying to think of why she would have reacted that way, and for me\u2014those were the times I got emotional about food.", "I had this moment of \u201cwho eats liver and onions??\u201d But combining that with her not feeling well makes me wonder if she\u2019s having an exceptionally bad period. Not an excuse, at all, just a reason for it. Might be she needed the extra iron liver would provide. \n\nStill leaves you as NTA", "NTA\nSimple failure to clearly communicate and everyone is tired.", "NTA \n\nyour wife is exhausting. are you sure u want to liv with a golddigger?\n\nunless shes pulling more money than u shes working less than half your hours yet the housework(cooking) seems split almost equally. she isnt even appreciative. this sounds like an awful gig.", "NTA Your wife had a mini-tantrum.  Ignore it like you would with a child.", "NTA, she seems highly ungrateful, if my partner brought home my favourite dish from a restaurant we liked without me asking I\u2019d be over the moon", "NTA your wife is being silly", "Doesn\u2019t matter she didn\u2019t specify and also didn\u2019t answer his calls to clarify so still Nta", "If she is, it's not his!", "You're very lucky not to have kids with her, because it seems she's a big kid herself. Is this her usual behaviour? She sounds awful, to be honest. NTA.", "Because it is all pasta (except Pizza, which obviously includes Pineapple, just like the Italians meant for it to have)."]}
