Good grief, you provided a really nice meal and were thoughtful of getting her choices. It seems awfully petty of her to be disappointed and then make a point of cooking her own dinner.

She asked you to take care of dinner and you did, seeing as how she got up to cook at 9pm id also wonder how sick she was or of she was just playing it up.

He spent 14 hrs in a physical job , who in their right mind refuses objectively tasty takeout?", "It\u2019s a question of communication and expectations. It\u2019s not about the takeout.

In this case, she didn\u2019t communicate that she had certain expectations. And unfortunately, when plans changed, he wasn\u2019t able to reach her.

Is that apparently a legitimate excuse for being an asshole, even into the next day now", "I guess. This whole situation just kinda shows that she's either a bad communicator or that she's hypocritical. She technically flaked on cooking because she wasn't feeling well. Fair. He didn't want to cook cause worked sucked. Also fair. Now she's made and upset at him. OP literally did everything right. Tried to  reach out to her, technically handled dinner, and when questioned told her basically he wasn't feeling well. \n\nI would get it if she was frustrated for that evening only. I get being hangry. But still holding a grudge about it the next day is kind of an asshole move."]}
