{"id": 34033, "submission_id": "18uhg8c", "title": "AITA for threatening to not attend my sister's wedding?", "selftext": "I (29F) have a sister called Ella (27F). Growing up I was put in the position of being a parent to Ella despite how close we are in age. Our dad died while we were young which to be honest wasn't much of an impact because he wasn't a present or involved dad and I don't think he really wanted us. Then when Ella was 6 and I was 8 she was diagnosed with diabetes and ended up in the hospital after falling extremely sick, which is how they diagnosed her. Mom fell apart and basically checked out after the diagnosis. She went to the hospital every day and was there but she never took anything in, made no effort to make sure she was able to help Ella deal with her diagnosis, wasn't there for me. Once Ella came home I had to take over and make sure we had something to eat and I had to push mom to bring money into the house someway because she lost her job after Ella's diagnosis when she basically ghosted her boss and refused to speak to them.\n\nIt was a tough life and Ella really clung to me. Lines were blurred because I wanted to be her sister but she needed and wanted a parent and after a while I was more of a mom in her eyes than a sister. Our relationship never returned to one of sisters. For Ella she couldn't see me as anything other than her parent.\n\nElla is now engaged to Jackson (30M). Jackson is my ex. We were together from the ages of 19 to 23. Jackson cheated on me and stole from me. He slept with a girl who was shitty to me at work and tried to excuse it as they got drunk (though I found out it happened at least 5 times). He also bought her stuff with *my* money. Literally took it from my house to buy this chick stuff. I was furious. I even called the police on him when I learned what he had done. \n\nElla started dating him 18 months ago. I wasn't happy when she told me. No part of me thought it was a good idea. She told me she knew he was an awful jerk when I knew him but he had changed and blah blah blah. I told her it was her life but she had to understand if they ended up being a serious thing it wouldn't mean I would be close to him. She told me that we (my husband and I, husband was Jackson's best friend when I was dating him and it's how we met) should at least be civil and give things a chance.\n\nThe problem now is she told me to buy Jackson a gift as a symbol of me accepting him into our little family. She has been at this for 3 months now and won't let up. She accused me initially of being bitter because I wouldn't. But then she called me selfish last week when I said I wouldn't buy him shit. She told me I have always been selfish and it set me off because after everything I did for her, she called me selfish and I threatened to skip her wedding.\n\nShe got so upset and ran to extended family (family who did nothing for us when we were kids) who all told me I was awful for making that threat. Ella even said I was cruel to even consider not showing.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1703948402, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18uhg8c/aita_for_threatening_to_not_attend_my_sisters/", "score": 1305, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Be blunt with her, she's dating a man who did huge amount of damage to your life, she made that choice, and as an adult choices come with consequences and you won't be sucking it up again as you were forced to do through your childhood. She's the one saying her relationship means more than you, this is on her, and if she doesn't like it then that's her problem.", "NTA. I think this is way above our paygrade here, but even so ... That is one wedding I would probably skip as well. And as for buying this jerk a present, well, is your sister possibly a little bit delusional? One thing is for you to let things slide, stop being near to your sister as long as she is with Jackson, married or not, another is accepting him with flying colours - Definitely Delululand. She just can't demand that, in all seriousness.", "Yeah. NTA and you\u2019ll be healthier and happier just leaving her to get on with it.

And stuff the judgemental, do-nothing relatives too.", "NTA\nTell her that your \"gift\" is letting him keep the money that he stole from you before.", "NTA. What has Jackson done to prove to you that he has changed? You were the wronged party - the onus is on him to prove that he has changed, not on you to believe that he is different now. Your sister chose to marry him despite the harm he did to you, and she needs to accept that there will be fallout because of this, and, again, the onus is not on you to accept this. It\u2019s on her to understand how this makes your life awkward. And her trying to force you to accept him is not helping matters. \n\nShe can accuse you of being bitter all she wants. The point she is missing is that you have every right to be bitter. Especially without some positive actions by Jackson to make up for the harm he did to you.

Tell them you sacrificed your life to care for her. Then block everyone including her and don't go", "NTA. The truth is that you won't accept him, and no amount of pushing from your sister is going to make that happen. You have every right to distance yourself from that dumpster fire and take some time to focus on yourself. If you can afford therapy, you should go for it. Either way, always know you can come visit some great mother figures on a wholesome sub called r/ momforaminute. Please let yourself be your priority for a while and if that means skipping the wedding, that's a valid choice. \n\nI'm feuding with my sister right now and m stepping away. I have to so I can protect my own mental health. We're sisters. Once that guy disappears out of my sister's life, we'll get back to it. Sometimes these things are cyclical.

Your relationship with your sister will probably disappear.  \n\nThis is the simple choice you need to make.  For your own mental wellbeing, think hard.  It sounds like some distance between you both would be good for you, but are you comfortable cutting her out entirely.  \n\nYou are NOT her parental unit and are allowed to free yourself.  Do what in the long run is going to give you the most happiness.", "NTA - Jackson stole from you and cheated on you while you were dating. That's enough. You really should just tell you sister that you love HER and support HER, but you cannot ever trust Jackson because of how he treated you.  People attend weddings to support the COUPLE. You don't support them as a COUPLE, so not attending the wedding isn't a threat, it's a reality - because you don't support her marrying a lying, backstabbing, thief.  It isn't appropriate for you to be there, because you hate him, and you hate that she is with him. You will be there for her when she finally sees that a leopard can't change it's spots. In the meantime, you will be polite when you are face-to-face with him, but that's the most she, or any one else, can or should ever expect from you. That said, it's high time that she stop badgering you about gifts for him to \"prove\" a falsehood. You aren't going to lie to him or to her about where you stand.  As to the rest of the family - they don't matter.", "NTA\n\nElla has made her own life choices, which you don\u2019t agree with but accept them as her choice.\n\nElla needs to offer you the same consideration. You do not need to feel forced into a situation you are not comfortable with. You are not awful for refusing to buy a gift or refusing to go to the wedding. You are perfectly justified to miss both these requests. I actually think it would be best to skip her wedding, how are you going to manage to say congratulations to both of them on the day?", "NTA. I think your dynamic with her has always been you giving and giving, while her taking and taking, and instead of being grateful and appreciative in her adult years, she just expects you to keep giving. Her getting with your ex despite knowing how shitty he treated you shows how she thinks about you. If it were me, I would keep my distance from her for the time being. You don't need to mother her anymore.", "NTA. \n\nAs someone who has been there, it may be time to just let her be an adult and make mistakes. But you don't need to sit and be a spectator.  She is an adult. You already did your mother's job. She screws up, it's on her. You don't have to watch her burn the world down with the wrong person.", "She\u2019s using manipulation tactics to control you\u2026.stay strong and live your own life. She was never your responsibility and should be a hell of a lot more grateful and understanding", "NTA Ella would have been dead to me the moment she started banging my ex there's lines u don't cross especially with ppl u claim to care about", "NTA but for your sanity\u2019s sake I think you should go NC with your sister/your family for a year or two.", "NTA. I think you did your part and some more on what she is concerned, you can take a step back. You owe nothing but trash to someone who cheated and stole from you. Her hooking up with him in spite of what he did to you tells you something about your relationship with your sister as well. She is either really spoiled and has a very twisted contact with reality or she has some resentment towards you for who knows what and is trying to \"punish\" you or rile you up. Either way, it's still not healthy. The age difference between you is really small, you both were thrown into a situation that was highly inappropriate, neither of this being your faults. You did the best you could for her (kudos to you for that) and she took it as she did because she knew nothing better. But the thing is, you are both adults now. Adults who should probably go to therapy in order to process whatever you've been through and try to get back to a realistic relationship where you both change your views on the role the other has in your life. You are not her mother, she is not your child and you should try to get out of this mentality. It will be a long and slow process and you both have to put in the work. You did \"your job\" (however unfair it was to you, because you had a mother) and you should prioritise your wellbeing. You don't owe her anything, and you certainly don't owe the ex-dirt-bag anything either. Do what's best for you, your mental health, your husband. And leave your sister be. Unfortunately, she will find out on her own what big mistake she is currently making. People like your ex don't change overnight. And he definitely didn't change if he did not apologise at all and still expects stuff from you. Take care OP. In my opinion, you would be justified to go NC with them. Imagine having them over, you would have to lock up all your valuables and hide even your chairs.", "NTA. Jackson treated you horribly.  It\u2019s up to him to take the first step toward reconciliation with you.  He should ask to  speak to you privately or with your husband present if that makes you more comfortable, then he should acknowledge how badly he treated you and hurt you and he ought to apologize.  After that, he should give you all the time you need and respect any boundaries you set, and he should insist Ella do the same.  They both have to accept those boundaries as a fair price for the harm he did.\nAny measure of forgiveness by you without repentance by him won\u2019t truly heal the relationship.  A once dumped a \u201cChristian \u201c man who did something really awful to humiliate me publicly, used the old \u201cjust joking\u201d excuse, then when I demanded he apologize he tried to roll out his prepared speech about \u201cChristians don\u2019t apologize, Christians forgive\u201d.  Right, he gets to be an AH and I have to make it all better.  Nope, reconciliation doesn\u2019t work like that.", "NTA and while you were parentified and Ella is also a victim of that, she is now an adult and you are allowed to set boundaries to protect yourself . I hope you are in therapy to process everything. There is no reason for you to be accommodating towards Jackson let alone buy him a gift.

Your sister's experience of her childhood isn't going to be the same as yours. Being parentified at such a young age wasn't just unhealthy for you. You see yourself as taking on a mother role for your sister and you say that she sees you as a parent, yet she also, in anger, told you that you've always been selfish. I suspect that there are other misalignments in the ways you both view the past. This doesn't negate any sacrifices you may have made, but your sister isn't obligated to align her needs with your expectations. Her truth and your truth don't have to be the same. \n\nSecond, it's always problematic when siblings swap exes. Period. Relationships are often strained if they don't break outright. It's unfair of your sister to put so much pressure on you to accept your ex as her soon to be husband and pretend the past never happened. You're not ready to forgive and forget. Unfortunately, you and your sister don't seem to have clear boundaries, perhaps due to your past in childhood. \n\nAs someone else stated, this is a bit beyond the Reddit paygrade. I think you may benefit from sitting down with a therapist to help untangle some coping mechanisms left over from the past. Your sister is old enough to make her own decisions and she doesn't need you to parent her anymore. You may need to learn how to parent yourself. You don't need your sister's approval to draw healthy boundaries for yourself and to decide who and what you need in your life moving forward. That may or may not mean making good on your threat.

It doesn't sound like there's been an apology, and he certainly hasn't paid back everything he stole. Without that, there's just no way for you to move forward with this guy.\n\nTell Ella that the only way you'll accept your ex as her partner, a part of the family, is if you get a genuine apology from him and he pays back everything he stole from you, and even then you'll never fully trust him until he's proved himself a changed man to you. You certainly won't be buying him any gifts until he's paid back everything he stole.

Don't engage.  Engaging with someone like this just prolongs your pain.", "I doubt he's changed. OP definitely shouldn't be buying him any gifts though, he doesn't deserve them tbh. I'm just more confused as to why Ella is dating and going to marry OP's ex. There's way too much to unpack there. Was Ella interested in him while OP was dating him, did Jackson really want Ella instead of OP. \n\nAs for the extended family, I doubt Ella mentioned that ~~Jackass~~ Jackson was OP's ex. Otherwise their reactions make no sense. But then butting in despite the fact they were in the wind when OP actually needed them, they can shove their opinions right back up their ass where they got them.", "considering OP is also with her ex\u2019s best friend i don\u2019t think she can trip too much on that part. because she pretty much did the same thing", "Fake poop or vomit is good but there are a variety of companies that sells bags of dicks (gummies usually). Might not be available depending on where you are located but that seems like an appropriate gift (on several levels).", "Yeah like the sister cared about the relationship when she went for her sisters sloppy seconds.", "I'm not. It's just how she expects me to basically be a saintly person who doesn't give a shit about myself and bends over backward for her and for him.", "No, but it\u2019s her fault for being an ungrateful cow", "Even a parent can't put a stop to who a 27-year-old dates.", "Ella was an adult. OP had no authority to \u201cmake\u201d her do anything.\n\nElla has no business requiring anyone to give a gift, much less her sister. After the way the soon-to-be BIL treated her, I wouldn\u2019t want to give him squat.\n\nOP is NTA, but Ella certainly is.", "OP shouldn't feel obligated to help Ella when Jackson inevitably cheats on her or steals from her or anything else. Ella knew what she was getting into and ignored it. If anything happens, it's unfortunately her own fault. If Ella persists with wanting OP to forgive Jackson, it may be better to cut Ella out of her life seeing as she's tying herself to someone that's known to be toxic.", "Surely all that money was gift enough", "If the sibling slept with the ex, it's an automatic \"off limits\" IMO.", "Yeah, decent men don\u2019t date their ex\u2019s little sister \ud83e\udd2e", "Probably turned in a dirt garbage truck. Because he had time to \"grow\".", "Yeah, fuck it.\n\nLet your family know the whole story and choose.\n\nOr go to the wedding and object and make a scene ;)", "I think your husband is right, Ella sounds super spoiled and doesn't seem to appreciate the sacrifices you made for her since childhood and just wants you to be subservient to her whims and wants. Also the useless family members that are harassing you can FO.\n\nTime to focus on yourself OP, I honestly think you should put some distance between yourself and your sister until she learns the concept of gratitude and how not to be a selfish brat.\n\nNTA", "Listen to your husband.\n\nIt seems that these two incredibly narcissistic people belong together.\n\nTime to tell them to have a nice life and then cut ties completely.", "Ella is definitely spoiled, and she thinks she\u2019s so special that she\u2019s exempt from Jackson\u2019s bad behaviour. He\u2019s changed, she says \u2014 well you thought he was different too at first, until it turned out he wasn\u2019t.", "He\u2019s absolutely correct about Ella and you should 100% distance yourself from this bullshit drama.  What\u2019s next?  Why can\u2019t you do xyz for your shitty Ex that I married.  I wouldn\u2019t go to a single family event where the two jackasses will be.  Do yourself a favor and skip the wedding.", "Is that when yall decided to screw each other? Before or after you found out about the affair?", "NTA. \n\nShe shouldn't be demanding gifts for her boyfriend period. Add to that the fact he's your ex, making the whole thing weird. Add to it that he cheated and STOLE from you, and he should be the one buying you gifts and apologizing.", "Your husband is correct. Sometimes when siblings are parentified, we end up babying or spoiling our younger siblings to make up for the lack of real parents. They become entitled because we've done everything for them before. I know that I was guilty of this and it bred an air of expectation that they deserve whatever they want. \n\nStick to your boundaries. Ella is a big girl now who will have to face her own consequences. NTA", "For your own sanity, step out of the whole situation.\n\nAnd if you care about your sister/daughter you need to let Ella know you'll be there for her when Jackson screws her over- or when she snaps out of whatever the hell she is trying to prove. Some people have to learn the hard way. \n\nUntil then, take care of you boo. Your inner child needs you.", "Sometimes you have to take a step back and let people live their lives. Let her tell people whatever but remind her of your boundary.  It feels like Jackson is the puppet master; this is a mess. Please keep us posted and I\u2019m praying Ella doesn\u2019t marry that character.", "Yeah, just one of those ideas that frequently have but would never do.", "No, she didn't. She got with his best friend. After ex cheated and stole from her. Unless the ex's best friend was, at some point, her sister's boyfriend, not the same thing. OP literally raised her sister when she is not that much older herself, and my hunch is that her sister hasn't got out of her rebelious phase and is trying to p%ss her off (as teenagers would do to their parents. Except sister is not a teenager anymore and OP isn't her parent, but was thrown into that situation). She will eventually realise what mistake she made when he will cheat and steal from her as well. Hopefully he will just stop at that and not get violent as well.", "Someone she got with after the ex cheated on her. So basically her sister saw the heartbreak this man caused her and went \u2018yeah I want some of that, and you need to be cool with it too\u2019. Not the same thing AT ALL.", "Dating an exs best friend is a far cry from a sibling dating your ex.", "Disagree.  OP's boyfriend was an objectively bad person.  Very bad.  Typically the bestfriend and girlfriend are constant witnesses and victims of very poorly behaved individuals.  It is a bonding experience. Cheating stealing lying assholes are not owed much in the way of loyalty when things are finally burned to the ground.  But big sis was a loyal dedicated sister and mother to little sister.  Little sister literally owes her very life to big sister.  So her not just getting with big sister's ex, but demanding big sister pay money for a welcome gift to asshole ex who cheated on her and stole from her is definitely a clear betrayal.", "There's also those spring-loaded dick glitter canisters. Glitter is very festive.", "You're NTA, OP, but I don't understand why you're entertaining either of them at all. I have been in a very similar situation. While my dad didn't die, when my parents divorced he moved several states away with his new wife and so may as well not have existed. My mom worked 10-12 hours a day and from the time I was 7 I was my younger (2.5 years) sister's main (sometimes only) caregiver. To this day she still sees me more as a mom than as a slightly older sister and I can 100% tell you she would NEVER EVER even think to date, much less marry a single one of my exes, much less a man who had screwed me over like your ex did; in fact she'd be first in line to come after him with a torch and pitchfork. It sounds like she's taken you for granted because you've just *been* there for her, and it's time to stop. The thing is, my sister started seeing me as a mom but I also started thinking of her as my kid, and it's hard to see your kid make mistakes, especially one this spectacular. For your own peace of mind I think you should take several steps back, let your sister know you love her and will always be there for her, and then definitely NOT attend this wedding. It will be hard but it's probably best to go NC or at least LC for a while just to give yourself some time to breathe. And maybe that time apart will allow you to go back to a more balanced relationship.", "With you can afford, therapy can really help you learn to put boundaries and space between yourself and your sister; you deserve to have your own life where she's not a big negative wet blanket in it.", "I think your sister is still chasing after you or something subconsciously since she's now dating your ex. Keep your husband away from her. NTA I suggest distancing yourself from her completely and go live your life. Don't go to the wedding. Maybe block her. You've been through enough because of her.", "I mean you can use this opportunity to be petty but I'm the type of person that will light a match and lock the door on my way out. \n\nYou could dig up a picture of the affair partner and frame it.  You could gift copies of the police report or an invoice for restitution of what he stole.  You can provide the list of amends and restitution he needs to complete before you'll attend her wedding (and wtf, it's like he targeted your sister to date to show what a good person he is to YOU.)\n\nIt will not end well for your sister.  He is trying to prove something to you or be shitty himself and be like, see the problem wasn't me, it was you because sister and I don't have any of those problems.  There is so much bs to unpack here.", "If you pretend these are two random strangers then maybe that's true, but in actual real life settings that just doesn't hold up. People have authority and sway over each other. People can convince and persuade others. In this case it would have obviously been the morally correct thing to do as well. So yeah, while OP isn't an asshole, I'm confused why they seemingly did nothing and just let this situation happen", "My thoughts exactly", "I have never in my life found someone my friend/sibling has had a relationship with even remotely attractive. I don't even understand what type of circumstance would necessitate a relationship with them", "No for real the concept of sleeping w someone my sister has slept with is disgusting that\u2019s an automatic off limits for sure even if it wasn\u2019t a shitty person.", "They don't deserve that much of my energy really since they never did a thing to help us as kids.", "Plus glitter is the gift that lasts forever!  I swear I\u2019m still vacuuming it up from last New Year\u2019s Eve!", "Yeah I would've gone LC as soon as they started dating. Who sleeps with/dates their sibling's ex?! Ew.", "I like you. Give him the gift he so richly deserves.", "I just don\u2019t understand why she got so upset because you wouldn\u2019t buy your ex a gift. Who does that? Who expects someone to buy a gift for someone who stole money from them? Bizzaro to say the least.", "I think it sounds like you know what you need to do. I'd probably send a message outlining everything that happened to the external shitty family members, and then proceed to employ the block function.\n\nI would tell the sister that I'm disappointed in her, and then block for as long as you feel necessary. I wouldn't go.", "They deserve to be called out for not helping you when you were children. And your sister is some kind of entitled if she thinks she can bully you into accepting him into your family.  If I were in your shoes, I would skip the wedding and go no or lc with her. But I would definitely tell her a few truths first. And them block everyone and live your best life with your own little family.  Good luck.", "If Jackson hasn't made amends, fuck it.  She chose.", "Because if OP played along and bought him a gift. \nThen the sister can live in a little bubble that everything is roses, flowers and unicorns and everyone is one big happy family.\n\nBut when OP refuses. She can't live in a fantasy that everyone is happy. \nAnd she will still have that tiny thought. \"I'm dating my sisters x who was cruel to her,\" \nGiving him a gift would erase that thought, and she can relax with the thought he's \"changed,\" and OP is so happy for them and showing so much acceptance towards him instead. \n\nThat would be the short explanation.", "Niimpa just.", "Prolly no longer needed."]}
