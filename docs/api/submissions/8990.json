He is not obligated to spend anytime with your kids, no matter how close he lives to you.", "YTA. Your brother is entitled to a life of not being your babysitter.", "YTA. Did you even ask your brother if if was okay to send them over? You basically are pawning off parenting on him.", "YTA He's didn't move for your kids. He's not a default babysitter or entertainer. He doesn't have to share his stuff, or his house. Your kids aren't his kids, and he doesn't have to do anything with them he doesn't want to. There's no 'calling him out' for not taking care of *your* kids.", "Based on what you stated here, YTA. \n\nHe moved near you, yes.

More to the point I think you're not considering his boundaries by having children no older than 13 with permission to go there what sounds like very frequently. I can only manage one day a week with family outside the home. Your brother is busy.\n\nThat comment about \"what was the point in moving if you don't want to spend time with my kids\" is vile.

The only person responsible for raising your kids is you.  If he wants to spend time with them, awesome.
