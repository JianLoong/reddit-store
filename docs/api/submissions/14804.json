She has a great group of friends, some who also have Down\u2019s and some who do not. However, we have had talks over the years about people who are trying to use her to just feel better about themselves. She\u2019d think these people were genuinely her friends but then they\u2019d reveal their real motivations. This only got worse as they approached the age to join social media. By now, she\u2019s pretty good at spotting it and advocating for herself.\n\nWren is a senior in high school. She is one of the few students with Down Syndrome. A few days ago, she came home with a bouquet of flowers and a balloon. She explained a football player \u201cShawn\u201d had asked her to prom. Another student \u201cMonica\u201d was recording it. Wren felt very overwhelmed and said yes, out of pressure. I told her she absolutely did not have to go with him. She messaged Shawn on Facebook and told him she didn\u2019t want to. He was receptive.\n\nI then asked Wren to show me Monica\u2019s social media profiles. As suspected, on TikTok she had posted the video with a bunch of virtue signaling garbage, making it out like Shawn was such a hero for going out. Captions said \u201cHe could\u2019ve asked a pretty cheerleader, but he wanted her to feel included\u201d. \n\nI reported the video and managed to track down Monica\u2019s mom on Facebook. I asked her to call me. When she did, I explained and told her the video needed to come down now. She was taken off guard and said she\u2019d talk to her daughter. I said I\u2019d stay on the line while she did. She said she didn\u2019t feel comfortable and I said I didn\u2019t feel comfort with my daughter being exploited. Eventually, she agreed and I listened as she told Monica to take it down. Monica tried to say it wasn\u2019t a big deal. Monica\u2019s mom said she couldn\u2019t make her. I said she either took it down or I\u2019d go to the police. She finally made Monica take it down. I confirmed it was down on Wren\u2019s phone, as well as told her she needs to talk to her daughter about exploiting people in general, but especially disabilities.\n\nMy ex (wren\u2019s mom) feels I was too harsh. She said that I should\u2019ve been more civil and that I bullied Monica and her mom.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1681511604, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12mg5bg/aita_for_not_hanging_up_the_phone_until_a_woman/", "score": 522, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Posting a video of a minor without the minor's consent and against the parent's consent=unacceptable. NTA", "NTA\n\n\n You advocated for your daughter and did not allow her to be exploited. Good for you.", "My daughter & her friends went to prom as a group, some with dates & some without. The whole \"date\" expectation seems to be a thing of the past.", "I utterly loathe inspiration porn.\n\nMuch of the time, it's used to make those of us 'less' disabled feel bad that we're not achieving as much as these superhuman figures are.", "Shawn didn't post the videos, sounds like he thought he was doing something nice", "Actually, imo, asking someone because they might be left out is a very nice thing to do but the whole video thing and using it for clout is the gross part", "Say what?", "[Bad bot](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12mg5bg/aita_for_not_hanging_up_the_phone_until_a_woman/jgag3ih?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)", "he still performed for the camera though.", "But they should be clear that they want to go as friends if they\u2019re not truly pursuing them.", "Asking someone because you pity them is gross. It's also making an assumption that no one would want to go with them.", "Or she felt overwhelmed to say yes when she didn't want to *because she was being filmed* and communicated that and Shawn gracefully accepted that. Showing his daughter that she can always say no if she's already given a yes and she's seen it in action now. Maybe she just didn't really want to go with Shawn? You seem awfully intent on saying this guy sucks for teaching his disabled daughter some people will take advantage of her because they will. If she doesn't like him like that she doesn't have to go to prom with him, you seem very intent on the idea but that she must like him but her dad made her feel pressured to take it back. Wren came to OP and told him it made her uncomfortable and pressured."]}
