She has a great group of friends, some who also have Down\u2019s and some who do not. However, we have had talks over the years about people who are trying to use her to just feel better about themselves. She\u2019d think these people were genuinely her friends but then they\u2019d reveal their real motivations. This only got worse as they approached the age to join social media. By now, she\u2019s pretty good at spotting it and advocating for herself.\n\nWren is a senior in high school. She is one of the few students with Down Syndrome. A few days ago, she came home with a bouquet of flowers and a balloon. She explained a football player \u201cShawn\u201d had asked her to prom. Another student \u201cMonica\u201d was recording it. Wren felt very overwhelmed and said yes, out of pressure. I told her she absolutely did not have to go with him. She messaged Shawn on Facebook and told him she didn\u2019t want to. He was receptive.\n\nI then asked Wren to show me Monica\u2019s social media profiles. As suspected, on TikTok she had posted the video with a bunch of virtue signaling garbage, making it out like Shawn was such a hero for going out. Captions said \u201cHe could\u2019ve asked a pretty cheerleader, but he wanted her to feel included\u201d. \n\nI reported the video and managed to track down Monica\u2019s mom on Facebook. I asked her to call me. When she did, I explained and told her the video needed to come down now. She was taken off guard and said she\u2019d talk to her daughter. I said I\u2019d stay on the line while she did. She said she didn\u2019t feel comfortable and I said I didn\u2019t feel comfort with my daughter being exploited. Eventually, she agreed and I listened as she told Monica to take it down. Monica tried to say it wasn\u2019t a big deal. Monica\u2019s mom said she couldn\u2019t make her. I said she either took it down or I\u2019d go to the police. She finally made Monica take it down. I confirmed it was down on Wren\u2019s phone, as well as told her she needs to talk to her daughter about exploiting people in general, but especially disabilities.\n\nMy ex (wren\u2019s mom) feels I was too harsh. She said that I should\u2019ve been more civil and that I bullied Monica and her mom.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1681511604, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12mg5bg/aita_for_not_hanging_up_the_phone_until_a_woman/", "score": 3513, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Monica needs to get a damn life.", "Ugh so mad for your daughter and people being cruel.", "God that virtue signalling crap needs to stop. All for social media status. So cringe. Good job!!! \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f", "NTA!!", "NTA. You did everything perfectly. This teen learned her lesson. You protected your daughter.", "NTA. Nipped that one quick.", "NTA!! I can't believe we're in the year 2023 and people are still doing this shit to disabled people. Good idea checking Monica's TikTok and I'm happy you were able to get it taken down.", "Phone calls work 2 ways. Monica's mum could have just hung up if she was feeling bullied.", "NTA", "Wow, I see why your ex is an ex, she's delusional. You did exactly what needed to be done as a parent. Im so disgusted in Monica. Most definitely NTA!!!!", "NTA I literally would love a parent like you, you were in no way \u201ctoo harsh\u201d", "Hell no, NTA. You have every right to protect your child from exploitation, DS or not. Way to stand up for your girl, papa bear.", "This was a GREAT dad moment. NTA.", "NTA! Nicely done!", "NTA this might be the turning point Monica needs now that \"harmless\" has consequences.", "NTA! Fuck Monica and her mom", "NTA. You were a strong advocate for your daughter. Good job.", "NTA", "Of course you're not, your priority is your family, your child especially, and you did what was needed to protect your daughter.  Bravo sir.", "NTA, you did the right thing by your daughter.", "NTA AT ALL! You're 100% right! Your daughters lucky to have such a wonderful mother \u2764\ufe0f I would have done the same if I was in your shoes! You don't fuck around and exploit the less fortunate for clout! Doing kind things for the wrong reasons is still bad.\n.\n The thought is nice but the using it for content for their social media is really cringey, disingenuous, and like a backhanded compliment to your daughter.\n\n I would feel uncomfortable too if I was in your daughters shoes. These people aren't your daughters friends, she knows that, no matter how nice they are, she could still sense that their intentions were shady.\n\n using your daughter for clout to project a humanitarian image at the expense of the disabled or less fortunate isn't very humanitarian, it's exploitive, no matter the intention.", "Oh so NTA! She needs to learn not to exploit other people for her own gains, in this situation social media likes. \nIt\u2019s not okay but so many people do this now. It\u2019s virtue signalling bullshit. I know this was a made up situation and the boy asked your daughter purely for it to be filmed but it seems like people can\u2019t do anything good or nice without having to share it to the world and say \u2018look at me, look at how good and wholesome I am\u2019.", "Good for you sticking up for your daughter", "Not only NTA but thank you so much. You advocated for your daughter and that\u2019s exactly what a mother should do", "The word bully is going around Willy nilly! You didn\u2019t bully her mother, you protected your child! I would do the same. Children need to learn how their behaviour impacts other people and you\u2019ve given an opportunity for a parent to teach their child better.", "Social media is a fucking virus for anyone.", "Remember \"Carrie\" and how well that one went. NTA", "Goodness is not goodness that seeks advantage. Good is good in the final hour, in the deepest pit, without hope, without witness, without reward.\n\nDoctor who is quite quotable at times", "100%. NTA", "Stella was an amazing woman\u2026 mostly because she was just like\u2026 everyone else. Funny as hell, an articulate interesting woman with a well read and educated mind, and man could she give the door bitches hell hahahah.", "\"should he retaliate\" doing what? Trying to have a relationship with your daughter? \n\nIdk the whole undertone re the Shawn situation seems sad to me. It's like you don't think your daughter could ever receive positive attention from others without it being a manipulation attempt. \nI'm interested in knowing what you would have done if they hadn't recorded it. Would you have still been suspicious of Shawn's motives or tried to prevent her from going?", "I am willing to bet this football player who didn\u2019t even know Wren didn\u2019t dream and scheme this up himself. Considering she was right there to film this moronic stunt and herTikTok contained other gross fake condescending staged videos like this. I all of this is the polar opposite of kindness. \n\nI have a funny feeling the football player wants to go places with Monica. Probably anywhere.", "I think their point is more about the mixed messages of things like flowers and stuff like that (and someone you don't know particularly well) is using romantic language and not platonic language.", "Point. Missed. You. \n\nAlmost no one cares if they are in the background. But when you're one of the subjects, or think you are... You care then.\n\nSaw a video on YT about a Black man confronting teens recording his car and everyone tried to say he was Karen. But why were they recording his car without asking? Rule one of photos and video is consent.", "Do you know OP\u2019s legislation?", "I like to assume the best of people till proven otherwise", "Here what people need to be aware. Because not common, it happens and it is absolutely vital.\n\nAt least in my country, children placement in emergency work faster than their abusive parents getting jail time.\n\nThis year, at the school I work at, there's a couple of kids that have been moved from the other side of the country for their safety. We have gag order on the fact they are enrolled in our school. If anyone asks they are not enrolled here.\n\nThey appears in no pictures, no videos, nothing. \n\nBecause you just need one picture, one video where they're in the background, and that going on the internet and all the extra trauma they suffer throught for their safety was for nothing.", "he def bullied that girls mum lol. \n\nlike 100%\n\nbut still nta", "They might. Phantom limb syndrome", "I\u2019m 15 years older than you and do use Facebook etc. none of the disabled kids at my very mainstream school were excluded from events. My niblings are now in their early 20s and disabled kids were always included at their schools too.", "Where did you grow up if you don\u2019t mind me asking, it sounds like a very kind place?", "Fremantle area in Western Australia.", "People are products of their environment, the world around us is very different to the world 20 years ago, let alone the world 40 years ago. I grew up playing sports outside on the street and with no pressure of social media. You seriously don\u2019t believe that has an impact on people? I feel like you\u2019re lying to yourself in order to avoid feeling old.", "Oh man, I'd forgotten how much of a fight spaghetti straps were \ud83d\ude05", "Hell no, I LOVE being in my 40s. I can't fucking wait for 50, I'm in my prime. When my dad turned 60, he told me, \"omg kaoticgirl, this is so easy. Everything is so easy now!\" I am  all in.  Dude. People are NOT products of their environments. Yes, they have *some* impact. But that whole nature/nurture thing turned out not to be real. Human nature does not fundamentally change. This isn't just me talking out my ass, it's been studied. But the hour is late and I am awake well past my bedtime. I'm gonna leave this now but if you are having any qualms about turning 40, allow me to assure you it is an absolute delight.", "https://youtu.be/svakH91_0eo", "I\u2019m incredibly comfortable getting older, that\u2019s why i acknowledge I\u2019m getting older and the world is changing. I embrace change and I don\u2019t pretend everything is the same as it always was. My grandfather started working in a coal mine at 13 years old, 13 year old me was messing around at school playing sports with buddies, we are totally shaped by our environments.\n\nOne question for you to muse on, if we aren\u2019t products of our environment, why do kids who grow up in foster care or group homes have worse education outcomes and are more likely to go to prison, the data literally shows how our environment leads to different outcomes."]}
