Quick side note, we're both in our 30s and both work in hospitality and worked in kitchens for years, so we're generally on our best behavior at restaurants.  \n\nAnyway. We sit down and are greeted by a young woman (early 20's) who drops some menus and asks if we want to start with still or sparkling water. I looked at the drink menu and saw the still was $9 and the sparkling was $12. Neither of us care that much about fancy water, so I said tap is fine. She gave a sort of grimace and a small noise.  \n\nI asked \"Is there something wrong with the tap water?\" She replied \"It's very hydrating.\" Followed by an awkward silence. This was very strange to me so I essentially repeated the question with slightly different verbiage and once again got \"It's very hydrating.\" I looked at her with with an expression of \"please explain.\" More silence. Eventually I asked \"What does that mean?\" She said, with no emotion: \"It will hydrate you.\"  \n\nNow I'm feeling weird about the whole situation. And I flat out asked, with no expression or connotation: \"What's wrong with the tap water?\"   \n\nYou guessed it! \"It's very hydrating.\" I stood up and told my wife \"We're going.\" Before my wife even realized what was going on, the waitress said \"Have a blessed day\" with the smuggest smile I've ever seen. Am I in La-La-Land here? The triplicated response seems really dumb for someone who is a 'professional' at hospitality.\n\n\nAnyway- my wife suggested I took it too far by leaving. In my opinion, I didn't take it far enough and should have spoke to a manager. But life's short- and I didn't. AITA?\n\nUPDATE 1: My wife was cool with leaving. We have a very equitable relationship. If one of us says to the other \"we're leaving,\" or any variation of that, we trust each other to know we made the right call and will figure out the rest later.\n\nUPDATE 2: This is in America.

Suspect you had the same type of thing going on here.", "NTA, next time instead of a tip leave her a note that says \u201cmoney can be exchanged for goods and services\u201d", "NTA - It is more than likely that she was judging your choice, thinking you were cheap. Although their is another possible scenario:\n\nYou know when something is objectively bad but you're not allowed to criticize it, so you find a way to compliment something random. Like you're at a friend's house, and they've just cooked a meal that doesn't taste very good. You can't bring yourself to criticize their cooking directly because you don't want to hurt their feelings, so you say something like \"\"Wow, your presentation is really something else tonight!\" or \"These plates look so fancy\".\n\nThat could be what happened here. Their tap water may not have been great quality or it could have had an odd taste.

I would assume that their tap water doesn\u2019t taste very good, which is why she made the face, but she\u2019s also not allowed to say anything disparaging about anything they serve at the restaurant, which is why she just kept repeating that it will fulfill the basic function of hydration. \n\nFor that reason, NAH because I get why you were frustrated but I can also see her being stuck between a rock and a hard place.", "NTA.  I'm not a conspiracy person, but this feels very much like a \"there's aliens among us\" moment.

After the second \"it's very hydrating\" I turn into Jim Halper, desperately looking for a camera.", "My take is that it was probably a really dumb manager/owner's upselling idea. They know the pricing on the water is crazy (seems to me for a place with $30-45 entrees), so they gave her a phrase to use, but no other instruction on how to use it without seeming to be a weirdo.", "What sort of answer did you expect from her? Sometimes you just gotta let things go. Okay, maybe she should not have \"grimaced\" - though I've been accused before of making expressions that apparently indicate things I certainly didn't feel, so I always take that with a grain of salt - but whatever.

She was judgy and you rightfully didn't feel respected cause you weren't.\n\nQuality restaurants don't rip their guests off by pushing 9-12 dollar water. They're always polite, regardless of your wallet.\n\nYou gave her plenty opportunity to correct her course. If the waiter is angry at you before you have even ordered, the rest of your night might be just as bad.\n\nAnd even if you and me totally misread the situation, you still didn't escalate or get angry at her. So there's no blame on you.", "So sparkling water doesn't hydrate as much, so why put it in your body? What the fuck did I just read?\n\nNTA that wait staff sounds insane.", "NAH. I feel for the waitress, the only way to avoid this kind of situation is either to perfectly control your facial expression, to lie about the quality of (the probably disgusting) water (and risk the customer finding out and taking their anger out on you) and tell the customer the truth (and risk to be fired). Like she was probably annoyed by this no-way-out back and forth. \n\nIt would have been better to explain your concern that keep going with pretty much the same question trying to intimidate her into answering.", "NTA, but I don\u2019t really understand why it bugged you so much. She made a noise and a face, whatever. I\u2019d probably just ignore it.\n\nBut sure if you didn\u2019t order anything you can just leave the restaurant if you don\u2019t like it, I don\u2019t see any problem with that.", "I feel like the tap water tasted ***really bad*** but she wasn\u2019t allowed to say it so she just kept repeating what was true without lying or slandering the restaurant.

Not a snowcone\u2019s chance in hell that I\u2019m paying $9 for WATER. \n\nShe\u2019s a brat and a judgemental server. \n\nI\u2019d write to the GM and tell them they lost sales because of her and her poor service skills.", "INFO\n\n> I asked \"Is there something wrong with the tap water?\" She replied \"It's very hydrating.\"\n\nI'm confused.\n\nBased on that exchange, the \"it\" in her response can only be in reference to the tap water.\n\nIs she arguing that tap water is **_too_** hydrating?", "No idea who's the asshole, but here's what I think happened\n\nSomething genuinely is wrong with the tap water (it tastes bad, or could even be really bad), but she doesn't want to get fired. So she told you a fact about it and nothing else, to try to hint to you something is wrong with it.", "Thanks OP I had a good laugh. Feels like one of those jokes about a person who completely misunderstands the meaning of a word and keeps using it in a wrong context.", "NTA the poor gal was told to sell the shit out of the friggin water and so she tried hey man pony up it\u2019s  VERY HYDRATING", "What did you want her to say? That it tastes bad? Would you believe her or think she was trying to upsell? \n\nObviously she was saying the only good thing about it was that it hydrates you, I'm quite confused by how many people are failing to understand that. Im assuming they are being intentionally obtuse.\n\nShe messed up by failing to not react to you asking for tap water but you made it so much more than was required. \n\nSounds like your wife wasn't actually cool with leaving, but did because you wanted to. She then expressed that to you and you dismissed it instead of questioning whether you overreacted you doubled down and want to take it further...\n\nIm gonna go with ESH, but mainly you. The waiter for her initial reaction to the request", "NTA. I feel like the interaction went sideways from the very beginning, when she said \"still or sparkling?\" Even if it is a nice restaurant (and $30-$45 a plate is nice but depending on the area it's not that nice) they should still offer you the option of tap water without you specifically having to request it. It's a really passive-aggressive way to start an interaction with a customer. \n\nI wonder if she was having a bad day or decided this was her last day at the restaurant or something and so she didn't care how she treated customers. I would leave a bad review at least and I'm glad you left - what is the point of dining out if a server is going to ruin the experience?", "NTA.

The only thing she can say about the tap water is that it\u2019s hydrating \u2014 the defining feature of water. As opposed to selecting a ridiculously overpriced branded water.

Most places I've been at that menu price don't charge for still at all and maybe $5 for sparkling.

Servers are the customer-facing representatives of a restaurant, and it's literally her job to service the customers in a positive manner. \n\nAs a former restaurant owner/manager, I would absolutely do what you did, but I would also have either spoken to the shift manager before I left or contacted them later to give some feedback. \n\nIf I had been that manager on duty that night,  I  would really want to know about how a server's shitty attitude was losing me sales.  If the shit manager has the same shitty attitude, then I'd contact the owner. To reiterate, serves works for the restaurant. The restaurant does not exist to put spending money in the servers' pockets. She was hired to help the restaurant survive and thrive. Obviously, she sucks at her job. It doesn't matter what her motivation for the comment was. \n\nHere's what does matter: Profit margins are really small in all restaurants, and even smaller in higher-end ones (not sure where the location is, so $30-40 could be high or average depending on where in the USA).  I assume that you made a reservation. If the restaurant was fully booked, that's one less anticipated sale, and if they could not fill the table, that's less money made.  Even worse if the restaurant is less than full. Restaurants employ many people, and when sales go down, shifts go down, paychecks are delayed...it's a tough business.", "NTA.

You\u2019d have to be drinking quite a bit of it to run into issues though, and you probably already know this, but in case you (or presumably anyone else who has access to very pure water and reads this comment) aren\u2019t aware, here\u2019s your warning lol", "Because it\u2019s very hydrating?", "Holy fuck I felt like I was a loon reading these comments about \"reee she's trynna upsell you, she was being stupid on purpose\"\n\n\nSounds more like OP missed a joke and the waitress just rolled with it to  me lmao", "Welcome to AITA where tipping has reached the point of a disease.

Especially the fatty meals like you mentioned, the acidity cuts right through it in a way that water can't. Plus it's sugar free so no extra calories.\n\nAlso smoothies are pretty sugary if you're worried about your blood sugar levels, be careful with that.", "Water? Like from the toilet?", "It's not, nor did I say it was. I simply explained the rationale behind it. \n\nAnd to be fair, there were *those* people. They asked for ice water with a ton of extra lemon slices (free) then added sugar packets (also free) to make their own lemonade. They were regulars. Everyone knew it was at best $1.78 for tip.

Like I\u2019m not gonna reduce a tip because a server is absolutely swamped so my order doesn\u2019t come out immediately, or check in on me multiple times throughout my meal.

I\u2019ve worked at places like that, \u201cdon\u2019t call our junk food junk food\u201d type crap.

Don't forget the ten sides of ranch. You can open button and start charging for the extra lemon slices. Lol. I did have tables who only got a $6 bowl of soup and tipped me 20, 30 so you never know what people you get. It's comes with the job, unavoidable,  once in a while you'll get these people but you can't be an ass to your table because they order tap water.

Or rather, the difference between ours and American does. I'm from Sweden and if someone came to check up on me multiple times during my meal here, I wouldn't tip them at all as I'd find that excruciatingly annoying. In our corner of the world, a server *might* come by *once* to ask if everything's to your liking but more than that is a self crucification on the waiter's part. Also, giving the guest the check without asking is a big no-no. We signal to the waiter when we want something and since they're getting paid no matter if they get a tip or not, they don't hover over their guests. I'm not saying American service is bad, just different from ours and I find it interesting. Americans who come here often find out service to be poor because they're used to another system.\n\nEdit: If I ever went to the US I would of course tip appropriately.
