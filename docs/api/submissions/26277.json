Quick side note, we're both in our 30s and both work in hospitality and worked in kitchens for years, so we're generally on our best behavior at restaurants.  \n\nAnyway. We sit down and are greeted by a young woman (early 20's) who drops some menus and asks if we want to start with still or sparkling water. I looked at the drink menu and saw the still was $9 and the sparkling was $12. Neither of us care that much about fancy water, so I said tap is fine. She gave a sort of grimace and a small noise.  \n\nI asked \"Is there something wrong with the tap water?\" She replied \"It's very hydrating.\" Followed by an awkward silence. This was very strange to me so I essentially repeated the question with slightly different verbiage and once again got \"It's very hydrating.\" I looked at her with with an expression of \"please explain.\" More silence. Eventually I asked \"What does that mean?\" She said, with no emotion: \"It will hydrate you.\"  \n\nNow I'm feeling weird about the whole situation. And I flat out asked, with no expression or connotation: \"What's wrong with the tap water?\"   \n\nYou guessed it! \"It's very hydrating.\" I stood up and told my wife \"We're going.\" Before my wife even realized what was going on, the waitress said \"Have a blessed day\" with the smuggest smile I've ever seen. Am I in La-La-Land here? The triplicated response seems really dumb for someone who is a 'professional' at hospitality.\n\n\nAnyway- my wife suggested I took it too far by leaving. In my opinion, I didn't take it far enough and should have spoke to a manager. But life's short- and I didn't. AITA?\n\nUPDATE 1: My wife was cool with leaving. We have a very equitable relationship. If one of us says to the other \"we're leaving,\" or any variation of that, we trust each other to know we made the right call and will figure out the rest later.\n\nUPDATE 2: This is in America.

Although their is another possible scenario:\n\nYou know when something is objectively bad but you're not allowed to criticize it, so you find a way to compliment something random. Like you're at a friend's house, and they've just cooked a meal that doesn't taste very good. You can't bring yourself to criticize their cooking directly because you don't want to hurt their feelings, so you say something like \"\"Wow, your presentation is really something else tonight!\" or \"These plates look so fancy\".\n\nThat could be what happened here. Their tap water may not have been great quality or it could have had an odd taste.

I would assume that their tap water doesn\u2019t taste very good, which is why she made the face, but she\u2019s also not allowed to say anything disparaging about anything they serve at the restaurant, which is why she just kept repeating that it will fulfill the basic function of hydration. \n\nFor that reason, NAH because I get why you were frustrated but I can also see her being stuck between a rock and a hard place.", "NTA.  I'm not a conspiracy person, but this feels very much like a \"there's aliens among us\" moment.

They know the pricing on the water is crazy (seems to me for a place with $30-45 entrees), so they gave her a phrase to use, but no other instruction on how to use it without seeming to be a weirdo.", "What sort of answer did you expect from her? Sometimes you just gotta let things go. Okay, maybe she should not have \"grimaced\" - though I've been accused before of making expressions that apparently indicate things I certainly didn't feel, so I always take that with a grain of salt - but whatever.

She was judgy and you rightfully didn't feel respected cause you weren't.\n\nQuality restaurants don't rip their guests off by pushing 9-12 dollar water. They're always polite, regardless of your wallet.\n\nYou gave her plenty opportunity to correct her course. If the waiter is angry at you before you have even ordered, the rest of your night might be just as bad.\n\nAnd even if you and me totally misread the situation, you still didn't escalate or get angry at her. So there's no blame on you.", "So sparkling water doesn't hydrate as much, so why put it in your body? What the fuck did I just read?\n\nNTA that wait staff sounds insane.", "NAH. I feel for the waitress, the only way to avoid this kind of situation is either to perfectly control your facial expression, to lie about the quality of (the probably disgusting) water (and risk the customer finding out and taking their anger out on you) and tell the customer the truth (and risk to be fired). Like she was probably annoyed by this no-way-out back and forth. \n\nIt would have been better to explain your concern that keep going with pretty much the same question trying to intimidate her into answering.", "NTA, but I don\u2019t really understand why it bugged you so much.

Not a snowcone\u2019s chance in hell that I\u2019m paying $9 for WATER. \n\nShe\u2019s a brat and a judgemental server. \n\nI\u2019d write to the GM and tell them they lost sales because of her and her poor service skills.", "INFO\n\n> I asked \"Is there something wrong with the tap water?\" She replied \"It's very hydrating.\"\n\nI'm confused.\n\nBased on that exchange, the \"it\" in her response can only be in reference to the tap water.\n\nIs she arguing that tap water is **_too_** hydrating?", "No idea who's the asshole, but here's what I think happened\n\nSomething genuinely is wrong with the tap water (it tastes bad, or could even be really bad), but she doesn't want to get fired. So she told you a fact about it and nothing else, to try to hint to you something is wrong with it.", "Thanks OP I had a good laugh.

That it tastes bad? Would you believe her or think she was trying to upsell? \n\nObviously she was saying the only good thing about it was that it hydrates you, I'm quite confused by how many people are failing to understand that. Im assuming they are being intentionally obtuse.\n\nShe messed up by failing to not react to you asking for tap water but you made it so much more than was required. \n\nSounds like your wife wasn't actually cool with leaving, but did because you wanted to. She then expressed that to you and you dismissed it instead of questioning whether you overreacted you doubled down and want to take it further...\n\nIm gonna go with ESH, but mainly you. The waiter for her initial reaction to the request", "NTA. I feel like the interaction went sideways from the very beginning, when she said \"still or sparkling?\" Even if it is a nice restaurant (and $30-$45 a plate is nice but depending on the area it's not that nice) they should still offer you the option of tap water without you specifically having to request it. It's a really passive-aggressive way to start an interaction with a customer. \n\nI wonder if she was having a bad day or decided this was her last day at the restaurant or something and so she didn't care how she treated customers. I would leave a bad review at least and I'm glad you left - what is the point of dining out if a server is going to ruin the experience?", "NTA.

The only thing she can say about the tap water is that it\u2019s hydrating \u2014 the defining feature of water. As opposed to selecting a ridiculously overpriced branded water.

How insecure are you that the perceived judgement of waitress caused you to ditch out on your plans?", "NTA If you were dining in your own city, you'd know how the tap water tasted.

The restaurant does not exist to put spending money in the servers' pockets. She was hired to help the restaurant survive and thrive. Obviously, she sucks at her job. It doesn't matter what her motivation for the comment was. \n\nHere's what does matter: Profit margins are really small in all restaurants, and even smaller in higher-end ones (not sure where the location is, so $30-40 could be high or average depending on where in the USA).  I assume that you made a reservation. If the restaurant was fully booked, that's one less anticipated sale, and if they could not fill the table, that's less money made.  Even worse if the restaurant is less than full. Restaurants employ many people, and when sales go down, shifts go down, paychecks are delayed...it's a tough business.", "NTA.

I\u2019m not sure if OP is the asshole, but I do think he\u2019s a little weird for not just moving on after the first time.", "Yeah and I mean tap water is free. You can taste it, come to your own conclusion and order something else if you want. No need to want to argue with the waiter about what she said, what else do you say about water? Waiter was probably just frazzled with OPs insistance and could not think of something. NAH.", "Who\u2019s smugness? The waitress or this guy? Cuz he seems to be high on his own farts.", "This is why I hate restaurants. The whole thing is a scam.", "Yeah I agree - I think what has always bothered me about \"still or sparkling?\" is that if you're not familiar with fine dining you might think still water meant the same thing as tap water, and then be surprised when you get the bill at the end. \n\nI also feel like someone saying \"still or sparkling?\" implies that you have to choose between one of the two options (which is probably why they do it) whereas it's a bit easier to say no to an appetizer suggestion.", "A server being shitty to a client shouldn\u2019t earn tips", "I\u2019ve worked in a lot of restaurants and bars - some pretty shitty - and I\u2019ve literally never seen anyone mess with food. Talk shit behind your back? Sure. But he didn\u2019t have a conflict with this server until he was being weird. If he\u2019d just asked for tap and ignored the snooty reaction no one would have thought twice.", "it comes through a dirty pipe straight into your cup and tastes dirty. if you\u2019re ok with that then drink it at home but if you go into a nice restaurant asking for tap water you\u2019re absolutely going to get a weird look. i would look at you weird too.", "no matter where the water is coming from it\u2019s going through a dirty ass pipe straight into the cup. it tastes nasty too. if you\u2019re fine with it by all means drink it but if you ask for that in a nice restaurant you should fully expect a strange look or two", "i agree water should be free but i think the face was more about the tap water aspect than the wanting a free drink", "Was that complicated to you? huh.\n\nYes, if you want to spend as little as possible that's fine but you do the work, then. I am not interested in fetching you free water, sir.You day old pizza is in the oven and you are welcome to take it with you when you walk your frugal ass out.", "NE clam chowder is the only way to go.", "Alrighty then\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", ">.white (not red)\n\nDamn! I never remember that.", "I never remember that!", "Well, yes, because the red clam chowder is Manhattan clam chowder, I think \ud83e\udd14?

I swear she\u2019s a robot or AI or something. She talks and acts like those weird people on TikTok and anything you ask or tell her she\u2019ll just say \u201cof course\u201d  the same way to anything. No change in tone, nothing. Trips me out every single time", "This. I was raised by a mom who was a server and worked in a restaurant for about a year myself, and because of that I regularly \u201covertip\u201d when I go out (especially if I\u2019ve been drinking) because I know the struggles. 20% is the bare minimum I\u2019ll leave on my tab, I think 60% is the most I\u2019ve left on a really good service bill.", "Nah.  Could have somebody else come in buying the sparkling water.", "I work in food service(pizza) and always try to tip. I know all to well what it's like to not receive tips even when it feels like you gave it your all. I do cashier, kitchen, and delivery. So often I'm making and delivering the food to customers. Sometimes I'll be delivering several hundred dollars worth of food and don't even get so much as a \"thank you\" from a customer.", "that table will be turned and she will have the time OP and his wife would have spent to sell the fancy water.", "I have a feeling she'd been trained to try and upsell, but was just terrible at it.", "My parents have been out on a \"date\" night with a $50 check. Server was happy with the $50 tip. During Christmas, every server, dishwasher, cook, ow er, etc would get a $20 tip. Almost cost em $600 1 year.", "I don\u2019t know - I prefer tap but will also order expensive cocktails, appetizers, and dessert.  And I tip well.  But, I strongly prefer tap water.", "Nah, they're not cheap, they're just not dumb. What kind of moron pays $9 for some bottled water when there is perfectly drinkable tap water available?\n\nNo self-respecting foodie would do that, but they'd certainly order heaps of the interesting dishes and drinks. Because that's the experience they're after, not some lame bottled water. \n\nThe money they don't spend on dumb shit is then available to spend on the actual food & drinks the restaurant makes.", "I'll order tap water and drink plenty and order what I want, not caring about price. I just don't care for paying for water. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "Not wanting to pay $9-$12 for water doesn\u2019t make you cheap.", "Yeah this is a really stupid take. I have no problem ordering apps, my wife likes a few glasses of wine, I usually drink soda as I don't drink much, but we don't worry about price when we eat out and but I'm fine with racking up a large bill.\n\nWhat I'm not fine with is having to pay for fcking *water*. Nothing annoys me more than places that refuse to offer tap water or heavily push bottled/sparking water. Sure if my wife wants fancy water I'm not gonna complain, but unless there's an actual issue with the water, I don't need to pay an extra $10 bucks for water. Especially with how crazy expensive food is right bow", "Uh\u2026no. I always order tap. Bottled water in the US in most localities is incredibly pointless and has the bonus of being terrible for the environment!  FOH!", "Honestly, I\u2019d have ordered cocktails, and offset the cost by tipping her nothing for her rude and smug service.", "I\u2019ve rarely been to a restaurant in the US that didn\u2019t automatically bring water.  Lots of people order alcoholic drinks and still want a glass of water.  They usually sit you and immediately bring water before taking drink orders.", "Hooman.", "Upvote for DS9!", "I\u2019ll pay two to use the elevator.", "Second best line of the series, after the Morn quote", "Damn it Quark! Where's my prune juice!", "> desperate for water \n\nAnd that\u2019s how they can charge so much. Capitalism at its finest!", "Not uncommon doesn't equal not outrageous.", "That was my least favorite part of European restaurants. Why are y'all so dehydrated, it's 95\u00b0 outside and no one is drinking any water. My husband and I were crushing 3-4 of those bougie-ass still bottles with every meal.", "From the standpoint of water.", "MerMAN!!", "Is it wet dirt or dirty water?", "When he\u2019s underwater, does he get wet?  Or does the water get him instead?", "My son Always asks for popsicles, then freaks out because he doesn\u2019t want them cold. Soo... you want juice?? No he wants a warm popsicle!", "I grew up drinking our municipal water, not really thinking much about it. My out-of-state husband insisted on a water filter and now I can't go back. \n\nI filled up a water bottle from the tap at the airport recently, and when I opened it a few hours later, was just overwhelmed by how much it smelled like chlorine. It was to the point I was making our hosts sniff the bottle lmao.", "I have an R/O machine at work.  I have a non-trivial number of carnivorous plants that need low- to no-dissolved solids water, and it was more economical eventually to buy an R/O machine than to keep buying jugs of distilled.\n\nBut I tell you what: that water tastes amazing.", "I grew up with well water also and now drink city water. Our city water also comes from I think 15-20 municipal wells and is then treated. I can\u2019t tell a difference in taste. But I will honestly drink tap water from anywhere I go. I\u2019m not a fan of bottled water. Most of it gives off that feeling like drinking dry wine. As though it\u2019s not hydrating your mouth.", "I've spent the last 17years in Sonoma spa country, where those mineral spas are our tap water. By now, everywhere else tastes... biological. :)", "I used to think the same thing had but where I love now had awful tasting tap water.  I do miss good hard water.", "That\u2019s what got me. Both of them acted fucking weird.", "This take is nuts, if you're in an expensive restaurant like that, good service should be part of the experience. The waiter was literally being rude.", "I only half agree with you. Sorry. I don't think she was in the right, far from it. But I don't think the solution is to not tip. It's more a problem with the whole system then a problem with you personally. But no matter how bad the service is, I will tip. I'll talk to the manager, owner, or whoever and let them know I wasn't happy with my experience. But as the customer, I shouldn't get to decide if that girl gets paid or not.", "A handful of times I decafed a shitty customer when I was a batista.

Cigarettes!", "It really is I remember seeing it a lot back in the beginning of Reddit before I had an account and just lurked around.", "Yeah, I really don\u2019t know anyone who has worked in service that doesn\u2019t tip big. A $9 bottle of water isn\u2019t even going to be $2 on a 20% tip. If someone is that concerned about what people are buying so they get a better tip, I can basically guarantee that person is a terrible server.", "if a server is absolute dogshit i would not hesitate to leave no tip, if they are great then I tip well.", "The bigger FU would have been to stay, order and eat extremely slow. Drink tons of tap water. No alcohol. Waste her table. And tip her like she deserves. \n\nBut I'd have just left too.", "Eh but OP noted they\u2019ve both been servers and tip really well. Still might not be worth her time to her, esp. if he were really an asshole to her, but you never know who you\u2019re unintentionally running off and it seems like bad practice unless he/they were immediately nasty with her and she wanted to get rid of them somehow. Like what if her next table was a jerk who tips $20 on a $500 bill? She has no way to know. \n\nIf they came in and were like \u201cwe want tap water and to split a salad\u201d sure that isn\u2019t a table she wants.
