She's being childish and needs to get over herself. Actions have consequences.", "NTA but ngl I don\u2019t think this is stopping here. After everything that\u2019s gone down Emily probably hates Leah even more now, not less lol. Except next time she might hide better. I\u2019d watch her very carefully", "NTA. Big brother to big brother, you did right by your little sister. \n\nthat bullshit with the shrimp could get someone killed.", "NTA.  The punishments your parents chose for your sister aren't your fault or your problem.", "Oh definitely NTA, she\u2019s nearly an adult, picking on a vulnerable child! Well done for being such a great older brother, I\u2019m sure Leah appreciates you a lot", "NTA. But I wonder why your parents adopted a child if not everyone was ok with the decision. If they knew that Emily would not be ok with having another sibling, then they shouldn't have brought in Leah", "NTA Your older sister was verbally and emotionally abusing the little sister. Abuse needs to be reported and stopped. It was great that you found a way to prove what was going on. Hopefully Emily will get the help she needs to become a better person, and since she will be an adult soon it is good, she is getting help now, because once she is 18 she can refuse therapy.", "What your parents chose as punishment for their daughter is not up to you.  You showed you were telling the truth, your parents should have believed you without the visual proof but that's a different issue here.  Your PARENTS CHOSE THE PUNISHMENT not you, you have nothing to bad about.", "NTA\n\nPunishment isn't harsh enough because wasn't that seafood thing attempted murder? Everyone's praising the parents now for doing all this but why did they never believe their son? So they kinda suck.", "NTA / she knows better", "Also opp shouldn't feel guilty. Op did not decide the punishments, the parents did. They deemed the crime worthy of the consequences, everyone elses opinion is just an opinion. Good on you op for still being able to feel empathy for your sister, but you can also learn the 2nd hand lesson about actions and consequences. You're not at fault for the consequences your older sister is facing.", "Wait 17 I thought she was like 8", "Spot on. The biggest assholes here are OP\u2019s parents. They clearly suck at setting proper family dynamics. Why does Emily hate Leah so much, was her opinion ever taken into account before adoption? Why did they never listen to OP when he tried to bring up Emily\u2019s actions? Why is Emily\u2019s punishment tangent on her two siblings and focuses on excluding her from what the rest of the family is doing? \n\nEveryone in this comment section saying \u201coh she\u2019s in therapy hopefully she\u2019ll be better\u201d is in for a rude awakening. Therapy can help, but it can\u2019t heal broken family structures when it\u2019s corrupted from the top down.", "She can feel however she likes. It's on her to communicate that and not torment a fucking child.", "I mean she\u2019s a giant asshole for doing it, but most allergies aren\u2019t life threatening. Emily clearly wanted to keep up the good big sis facade, I doubt she\u2019d do something that actually puts Leah in the hospital, because then it draws questions", "NTA. You absolutely did the right thing. **Even if** the punishment were overly harsh, you're not the one who set it. That was your parents. That was their decision. All you did was report what you saw and knew to be true. Which was the right decision, no matter what consequences may have happened later.", "Honestly the way OP worded it wasn\u2019t the best, but the substance of what you\u2019re objecting to is that the parents are protecting a traumatized little girl and OP from their abuser. The parents have said these kids abuser is still family, which she is, but that because of her actions her victims get to decide when they are comfortable again being around her. \n\nThe other side of it would be to force OP and his little sister to attend family functions and outings with their abuser. \n\nPut that way, I have very little sympathy for the sociopathic behavior that would allow an almost adult abuse an already traumatized child because she wasn\u2019t the only girl in the family anymore.", "This. As soon as I read this, I thought of the sister in that Netflix \"Half Bad\" series. Emily needs intensive therapy asap or she could become a genuine threat to that little girl in the future. Also, kudos to OP for standing up for your little sister. She really needed you and you were there.", "[removed]", "I wouldn't say it was overly harsh. She has been bullying her for two years without getting caught and even attempted to cause physical harm that (depending on the severity of the allergy) could have led to their little sister's death. If she had died and he revealed to their parents that she knowingly did this, she could have been sent to juvie by their parents and the state after a lengthy legal process.", "She is still a child though too and have a legal right to remain in her home.", "That's a bit over the top to be frank. Yeah, she is an asshole, and parents need to protect Leah from her, but she's still a minor whom parents are legally responsible for providing housing for.", "Can't take an inheritance when you turn 18. That's not how it works", "I think you\u2019re 100% right here. Emily is 17, she\u2019s nowhere near fully developed emotionally to handle her emotions in a mature manner. To her, it probably seems like her parents picked Leah over her (and in a way she\u2019d be correct). And now she\u2019s not even allowed on family outings, so it further reinforces her self fulfilling prophecy of Leah replacing her", "You did the right thing by making your parents aware of the situation, but your parents are TA for responding so strictly.  That is too much for a 17 yo girl.", "Is it a lot of punishment's for your older sisters behaviour, possibly. Did you put the punishment's in place, no. This is what your parents have done and have said they'll do more if your sister doesn't get her finger out and stop acting like a bully.", "NTA- You did well. Emily's friends and your cousins who took her side need to hear what she said. And even after that if they continue to support her, ignore them. Her friends don't matter but do report to your parents about those cousins. It clearly shows what they think of Leah", "NTA - Your little sister has an awesome brother.", "NTA you are doing amazing protecting the little one. The older sister should be a role model to her, not a bully. And I\u2019m glad you have your little sisters back.", "NTA, at all.  I'm really impressed by the steps that your parents have taken, and I think they are all justified.", "NTA \n\nAll you did was make sure the truth came out. You didn't choose the punishment, your parents chose the punishment that they saw fit for that situation. \n\nThe fact that your sister got any punishment isn't your fault, it's her fault for behaving in a way that made your parents think she needed it.", "NTA- You're an amazing brother for being Leah's advocate! Emily is basically an adult bullying a child and even knowingly tried murdering her. She should know better. I'm glad you started that recording, so the parents could see exactly what happens. Leah is a defenseless child with potential trauma to boot. I'm also a bit peeved that your parents never believed you at first, which let it continue on. I guess, without proof though, their hands were tied.", "NTA, so many abused kids would be helped to have a brother like you.", "You are NTA. I'm seriously wondering if this punishment will make matters a lot worse, though.", "How was this adoption even allowed.

You are an amazing big brother.", "NTA. You did everything correctly in order to get the truth out there, and even went as far to protect your little sister in the process. The result is not the punishment of one shitty action. It is the result of how long she got away with it.\n\nYour sister got what's hers. My mom would have punished me similarly, and has in the past over other things I've done. We eventually learn to not be assholes. Eventually.", "NTA", "NTA \n\nYou did very well by showing your parents how she actually is when they're not around. \n\nYes, your parents may have gone a bit overboard with all the restrictions but I think they'll lent them up after some time. \n\nShe really needs therapy and fkr the time being, being on house arrest is the best way to let her think about how wrong her actions are.", "NTA. Sibling abuse is a real thing that doesn't get enough attention from parents. Thank god for you stepping up to protect your little sister and making your parents face the truth. I'm happy knowing that your little sister had a great advocate like you in her corner.", "NTA.

Incidentally, why did your parents decide to adopt this child, and do you believe their reasons?", "NTA.  With regards to Emily, I can only say that if you play stupid games, then you win stupid prizes.", "These things are not going to make her like her adopted sister more, but will make her think twice about being so unkind.

I worry about your sister retaliating, though. Maybe you need to suggest family therapy.", "NTA you have done nothing wrong. You alerted your parents to a problem and it's up to them to deal with it. \n\nNow, I don't exactly agree with how they have dealt with it. Threatening inheritance is a bad idea because the outcome is too far away. IMO conditional punishments should be no more than two weeks or at most a month away because either the parent or child will forget about the punishment and/or by the time it comes to pass circumstances may well have changed to stop the punishment from being fair. I also have a feeling that they may have gone too far and this will cause more resentment than remorse but is not your fault. You are not the parent. You're just the whistle blower.", "Easy NTA.\n\nAnd mate, you're doing a wonderful job of being Leah's brother.", "Give Leah. Big hug from all of us. And you deserve a pat on the back big brother.

Thanks", "You\u2019re a rockstar. You did all the right things. Her punishment is NOT over-the-top.

And she needs to change. NTA", "Did your parents had the adoption talk with you and your sister before they adopted your younger sister?", "Not just a bully but attempted murder!

Plus why bring Leah in to the home when there were clearly serious issues with having her there, foster care and adoption are great but you have to work with everyone being on the same team. Emily is not on the same team, she\u2019s not ok and her behaviour was terrible but poor Leah just got put into a situation where she was stuck. I\u2019m glad the parents are acting now but it shouldn\u2019t have come to their son recording Emily to prove that she was bullying Leah. They wanted to give Leah a home and ignored their daughters issues, they ignored their sons warnings and now they\u2019ve done a 180 and are going the total opposite. I hope that they speak with a therapist or social worker to also work on integrating their family and building bonds because the punishment they have selected is likely to make Emily dislike Leah more or encourage the feelings of rejection she\u2019s been acting on.", "NTA, this is top notch big brothering.", " NTA you protected your little sister. The older sister needs help and to be honest I don\u2019t think you\u2019re parents were far enough\u2026. I would have taken the laptop and phone and probably her car", "NTA.

However I think your parents are. Adopting a 6 year old is a huge thing to do and I wonder how much they considered your sisters needs in all of this. She was only 14 when a new child was brought in and upset the family dynamics. It sounds like your parents have wilfully ignored the fact that there were issues here for a long time and now have scapegoated your sister so they don\u2019t have to look at themselves. You all need family therapy or you\u2019re going to end up losing your big sister entirely.", "NTA. \n\nYou didn't do any of this to her, her own actions did. You just communicated what was happening to your parents.", "NTA. The \"punishment\" wasn't even your decision. So if people say it's to harsh that's on your parents, not on you. You just showed your parents what they needed to see. In the long run this will probably have a good impact on everyone, especially with your parents making sure that she has therapy to work on it. And for Leah it will mean the world, this will change her perception of herself and life. To know that she is worth it, that she is loved, that she is cared for and safe. Is anyone saying that you should have let your 5 year old sister being bullied? If so, those are not people who matter.", "NTA.\n\nYou had me at she fed her shellfish.  \n\nThe punishment is appropriate.  You've saved Leah, and being in therapy and having your parents address her dangerous and cruel behavior has likely saved Emily from becoming set in her ways as a...well...you know.\n\nYou've been a good brother to both of them.", "This is a nearly adult bullying a fucking 9 year old and making her life a living hell. In no way are you the asshole, OP.  \n\n\nNTA.", "NTA she's bullying a child that's practically half her age. She needs to get therapy, she does not need a new car.", "The one and absolutely clear part of this is that you are NTA.\n\nAll you did was look out for a young person being bullied under your parents' noses. You brought them irrefutable proof of the bullying. That's it.\n\nSome folks here say your parents did just right; others say not enough. I think the immediate response, the requirement of counseling, the restrictions on talking to you or Leah along... are all good. Losing certain privileges is definitely good. Having teeth (meaning real consequences) if she violates things like your personal space are also good.\n\nI'm not sure if some of the specifics were the best - e.g., threatening the inheritance. (If Emily already feels her place is threatened by Leah, that is just going to exacerbate those feelings. Plus, that's something the parents don't actually owe Emily, so it's almost like promising it to her if she 'behaves'.) But whether the consequences for Emily are perfect or not has nothing to do with you. That's between your parents and Emily.\n\nYou protected your little sister and got proof of what your big sister was doing when she thought she could get away with it. That was a good thing.

But damn you and Leah are the only ones coming out clean here.\n\nObviously Emily is the worst one and quite frankly disgust me with her attitude and blatant cruelty towards poor Leah.\n\nBut your parents should also take a good long look at themselves.\n\nBecause you do Not adopt a child, especially not an older one, without discussing it with the whole household before even beginning the presses once everyone is on board. They clearly didn\u2019t do that.\n\nNor did they take you serious when you told them of Emily\u2019s behavior. Never dismiss your children like that without looking into what they say.", "OP is a damned legend.\n\nThe roaches always flee from the light OP. Always have the light handy and never think its wrong to shine it.\n\nMaking people aware of other's shitty actions is never the wrong thing to do and you should never feel guilty about it.", ">wasn't that seafood thing attempted murder?\n\nProbably not.

This is what I\u2019m saying, you want to repair the family by isolating her from her family, parents are definitely TA.", ">From a child psychotherapy perspective, they've done everything right\n\nI strongly object to that. Preventing her from going to family events and threatening to cut off her inheritance are only going to drive her away.", "That's what gets me about it, did they just straight up think OP was lying about all that, like consistently?", "No it\u2019s on their parents not to prepare family to new addition. They should have a family therapy 2 years ago. Big sister is the AH. But parents are the biggest especially as they 1) not believe OP 2) did not notice anything wrong. Did they even asked girls how was in the arcade? No? Not interested. \nAnd yes punishments are overly harsh. Emily is basically jailed for the next 4-5 months without contact with her family and her friends. She\u2019s isolated. Now, what is the purpose of this? What the point? What is the expected outcome? The outcome will be resentment and anger. Emily now will never see Leah as anything then a bother. And yes now Emily is 17 almost adult. But her life was thrown upside down when she was 15. In the most hard teenage year. \nShe IS AH. But she was still a kid lashing out. Parents are AH. Great that they adopted? But maybe start parenting.
