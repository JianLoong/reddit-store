Me and Emily\u2019s parents adopted Leah almost two years ago. Since she has joined our family, I have taken the role of big brother very seriously. She is genuinely the sweetest kid.\n\nEmily, though, absolutely despises Leah. She\u2019s hated Leah since our parents told us about her and has gotten much worse at hiding it recently. She was our parents\u2019 princess and I have no doubt that she sees Leah as a threat to her title. Our parents, however, think she\u2019s the most perfect doting older sister.

Or the way that she conveniently forgot Leah was allergic to seafood before serving her eat shrimp alfredo. \n\nI\u2019ve tried to tell my parents what I\u2019ve seen and what Leah\u2019s told me, only to be told flat out that they don\u2019t believe me. Until recently.\n\nOn Wednesday night though, I finally got fed up. My parents were out for a business dinner and me and Leah were watching some talent show in the living room until Emily came down and scolded me for \u201changing out with the charity case.\u201d Leah started crying. I started an audio recording. She went on calling Leah a crybaby and a dirty attention seeker. I told her to stop projecting on my little sister. She lost it and called both of us every name in the book while I gave Leah my airpods so she couldn\u2019t hear anything. After a solid 5 minutes I turned off the recording and told Emily to shut the hell up. I brought her into the kitchen and called her pathetic and that I\u2019d choose Leah over her in a heartbeat and she stomped away in a huff.\n\nWhen my parents got home, I showed them the video. They were devastated and enraged and blindsided. They apologized to me for not believing me and had a serious talk with Leah about coming to them if something bothered her. And, for once, Emily did not get away with her actions.\n\nShe had to deal with a serious \u201cI still love you but I am so so disappointed in you\u201d speech from my parents and is practically on house arrest until summer starts. She has to start weekly therapy so she can deal with her emotions better. She\u2019s no longer getting the new car she wanted for her birthday. She can\u2019t go to her senior trip to New York that she was excited for. All of her electronics were taken away except for her school laptop and flip phone. She\u2019s not allowed on any family outings unless both me and my little sister agree to it. She\u2019s not allowed to talk to my little sister or me alone unless we let her. And if she retaliates against me or Leah she gets part of her inheritance taken away.\n\nMost of my brain is crying out that justice has finally been served but a very itty bitty part of my brain (and a lot of me and my sister\u2019s mutual friends and cousins) is saying that it\u2019s too much.", "created_utc": 1676076446, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10z7w4l/aita_for_protecting_my_little_sister/", "score": 64, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I wouldn't want that for her and I don't think you would either.", "Only your parents likely know the trauma endured by little sis to have brought her to your home. They punished big sis as is their responsibility. Your obligation ended by telling and showing them what's been happening. NTA", "Nta you were right to report and document the behavior.  The punishments fairness is not up to you nor is it your fault", "NTA. You can never be the AH while you are advocating for your little sister! Please continue to be the best big brother that you already are.\n\nIt sounds like Emily needs the therapy that your parents are getting for her. She clearly has some issues, but she is old enough to know better. Whatever she thinks of Leah being adopted, she is old enough to know better than to mistreat her. Any punishment she gets for her bullying (that's exactly what it is) is on her, not on you. You stopped it before it could escalate any more!", "NTA\n\nYou did the right thing.\n\nYou don't get to decide what punishments your parents chose for her actions. I am sure she will blame you for them but all you did was prevent abuse. Remember that if she tries to attack you about it.", "NTA-You did the right thing! She's lucky to have you for a brother. \n\nI do think the punishment is too much but that's on your parents.", "Holy smokes... This about made me cry. NTA. Never ever feel like you shouldn't stick up for your little sister. I speak from the awful experiences I had growing up in which my sibling went out if their way to do me harm and NEVER stuck up for me not even once. \n\nNow, your older sister has some issues. But they aren't with the little sister, they are internal. Leah just happens to serve as a mirror where Emily can see the most unpleasant parts of herself. She has zero love for herself therefore has none to give to Leah.  I don't want to sound too cheesy here but I am willing to take the risk when I say, please give yourself a huge hug and feel the love you have for yourself and your sister. Because you deserve to feel pretty damned good about yourself.", "NTA and I'm impressed your parents did the right thing and grounded Emily and took away major perks and gifts. What Emily did is very serious and can cause lasting damage, so it only makes sense that she gets therapy, punishment, and supervision while she's still a minor.\n\nI'm hopeful that Emily can turn a corner and learn her lesson / become a kind person to Leah.", "NTA. You did a great thing and Leah is very lucky to have a brother like you, OP. Bullies should not get away with acting like that. Yeah it sucks she misses out on social things but she needs to get herself together and see real consequences.", "NTA,\n\nYou're not the one who made the punishment! You did what was right in this case and definitely take solace in that. I suspect your mutual friends and cousins are only getting part of the story anyway, and of course they will defend the one they prefer. It's not right but it's understandable.\n\nAs to the punishment being too\\* (edited for grammar) harsh, well remember that they probably feel guilty for ignoring you before. There's years of them dismissing you; I'm betting they're trying to account for the fact they were told this and believed your sister while you and Leah suffered. Is it an over-reaction? Maybe; I do not think so given the above. But by any measure it IS very harsh so out of the blue and without the context yeah people will be rallying against it. But that wasn't up to you, it was up to your folks.\n\nAnd just focus on the fact how terrible a person Emily is (hopefully was).", "nta at all", "NTA.

Honestly, it\u2019s terrible  what Emily has been doing to Leah, and you are an awesome brother, both for protecting Leah AND for finally getting your parents to protect her as well, but the punishment is WAY over the top. It\u2019s not your fault.", "nta but your parents are, 1 for ignoring you and 2 for creating a power dynamic between the 3 of you regarding your sisters punishment, your sister should be allowed to talk to the both of you, that punishment is unnecessary in my opinion but what your sister was doing was harmful and disgusting", "NTA. You protected your little sister from bullying", "NTA I'd give you a crown if i had one.", "NTA. If left unchecked Emily's behavior could result in severe psychological trauma for Leah that could last a lifetime. Your sister is facing the consequences of her behavior. She's almost legally an adult and she's bullying a young child, so she needs serious consequences.", "NTA\n\nBut the fact that a small part of you is feeling guilt is really good - it shows that you care about both of your sisters.\n\nI would maybe perhaps apologize to her about what you said about choosing Leah over her if that is not how you truly feel, but otherwise well done!", "NTA......Emily is definitely TA though", "NTA obviously but yikes... I don't think Emily is going to get any better with Leah. Your parents are probably going to slack off and it'll go back to how it was.", "NTA.\n\nJeez.\n\nI can't imagine treating *any* child like that. And honestly imho that's very near/at the the \"Get CPS involved\" stage if she's trying to feed her foods ***that could kill her.***  (I say this as a fellow violently allergic to seafood person/will end up in the hospital with anaphylaxis person)\n\nPlease continue being a good big brother.", "NTA but punishment will only deepen her resentment towards you and you younger sister.", "NTA. What your parents have laid out isn't a punishment. From a child psychotherapy perspective, they've done everything right. They are taking her to therapy, they are forcing her to be empathetic, they are giving the abused person agency, and they are making her actively work towards earning trust, and extra curriculars.\n\nIt looks harsh, but this is a good plan and, if the therapist does well, your sister will become a better person for this.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

What do you think about sitting down and talking to Emily about all this? Just you and her.

Please document any nastiness coming from them especially if you think Emily is getting them to harass you \n\nAlso while the punishment may seem harsh (personally I think it\u2019s very justified) this is actually good for Emily too: her reaction to Leah and the way she treats her are not normal, and she desperately needs therapy, which she will now get.", "NTA You are a good brother.", "NTA - you need to remember that you are not the one who is punishing her. That is your parents job. You provided proof that she was acting horrible and mom and dad responded the way they did. Being a bully to a young child is a huge red flag!
