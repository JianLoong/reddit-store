During school holidays my husband and I juggle like all parents do.\n\nHalf term holiday is now a week away.  The kids are off for a week. We wanted to go away.  My husband was able to take the time from work, but I wasn\u2019t.  My colleague had already booked the same week and we cover each other, so our time off can\u2019t clash and I wasn\u2019t allowed the time off.\n\nIt\u2019s unusual for him because he\u2019s not got kids and usually avoids school holiday time because of the cost and he prefers the peace if he goes away. He\u2019s told me this.  Because it was a bit weird, I asked him about it.  He said he did want that week because it was a holiday with his GFs family and her sister had kids.  He\u2019d booked it first, so not a lot I could do.\n\nIt\u2019s also looking like we might not be able to get a full week together during main summer holiday, because of work clashes, so this week would have been something.\n\nWe decided that husband would take the kids away for the week.  Flights booked, everything arranged.  I\u2019m upset not to be able to go but at least they get something.  \n\nYesterday my colleague mentioned in passing his plans had  changed (a medical issue but not an emergency) and he cancelled his week.  I was sympathetic until I realised he\u2019d actually cancelled it a few weeks ago (before our trip was booked) and not told me.  He said he\u2019d not realised I wanted the week and apologised.\n\nI can\u2019t get flights now, unless I go on a different day and pay a fortune.  I\u2019m really upset.\n\nHe has now just asked me if I can swap a rostered on-call week with him later in the year for his GFs birthday (we may not get called but need to be available).  I said no and told him it was because he\u2019d stopped me going away with my kids.  He said he\u2019d had to cancel, hadn\u2019t realised it was causing me a problem and had apologised for it but I was being vindictive.\n\nHe\u2019s now found another swap so he\u2019s ok.  It has caused tension between us though.\n\nI\u2019m wondering if I\u2019m in the wrong here - I always try and take that week and asked him about it, so it should have been obvious. Even if it wasn\u2019t, surely immediately asking me for the swap was tactless. \n\nAITA?\n\nETA - when I said I asked him about it, I indicated I had wanted that week, I didn\u2019t ask him to change because he had booked it first.

I get why that's frustrating.  Now, whether he \\*should\\* have been oblivious or not is difficult -- something that's really obvious to you might not really have registered for him.  He's got his own stuff going on - his own life, now a girlfriend etc.  It's not necessarily reasonable to expect him to pay attention to your vacation schedule.  And punishing him for being oblivious is not likely to make him be kinder next time.  All you're really doing is setting up a situation where he won't help you, and you won't help him.  That's not going to make for easy sledding for either of you.  I would accept his apology, make one of your own, and decide that you both need to be really clear and explicit about the vacation time you want.

Yes you do not have to swap with your coworker but you made sure to go out of your way to tell them why you wouldn't swap with you. Point blank they put in the time off before you did. You also went out of your way to question them why they needed it off which isn't your business.

So yes YTA for being petty and vindictive.", "YTA- its not up to him to tell you if a vacation has been cancelled.

Now your being petty by not swapping when you can do it", "YTA.  \nI was going for not, but having kids doesn\u2019t make you automatically have (all) the school holidays.

If you and the colleague cover each other on things it is normal that he is requesting something.   \nWhile this week was maybe something that was on your mind, I can imagine he forgot your question about why he took that week.

Being petty about an unexpected change to his plans, regardless of when he found out, is a one-way ticket to never getting any support in that job now.\n\nYou've burned your bridges.\nDo what you will with that, but don't expect work to be fun, or for you to get any cover support for time off now.", "YTA - no, no it wasn't clear you had wanted that week because he can't read minds.  If he could, I doubt he would have a 9-5 job.  Also, just because you have kids does not give you ANY more say in days off than anyone else in your office.  That's where you entered into AH territory.  He doesn't work for you so he doesn't need to keep you informed on anything.  Even if it's something that's important to you.", "YTA.  You're being petty and spiteful over something that was ultimately your responsibility.\n\nYou may have to coordinate your leave to ensure adequate coverage at work, but he's your colleague not your boss and ultimately not in charge of your leave.  You must have a boss or HR or someone else you go through to actually request your leave and get it approved - it was your responsibility to keep tabs on the leave calendar or ask whoever approves leave if they would let you know if that week becomes available or there's alternate coverage allowing you to take the week.  It wasn't your coworker's responsibility to remember weeks after your conversation that you also wanted the week off - he has his own life to worry about.\n\nYou also have a crummy entitled attitude - you seem overly involved in studying your coworkers habits and judging his reasons for leave.  The fact that you questioned him about it is honestly just plain weird and none of your business.\n\nIf you actually want to do something that helps the situation, talk to your employer about instituting some kind of leave waitlist so that you can call first shot at dates you were denied if they should happen to become available or some kind of shared calendar with a waitlist signup or whatever.  Nearly every employer I've ever worked for that has to care about coverage (e.g. call centers, hospitals) had some sort of waitlist mechanism.", "NTA for not switching.

No. I'm pretty sure he had other things on his mind. Maybe, oh, his medical issue? \n\nYou're the one taking it personally and are now being vindictive.

Apologize for being petty and vindictive, and swap with him the next time he asks as soon as you can, but also talk frankly with him about how this hurt you and why, and why his request to swap afterward hurt even more.
