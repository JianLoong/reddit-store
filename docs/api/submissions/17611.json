They aren\u2019t babies but we can\u2019t leave them home alone all day when they\u2019re off school.  During school holidays my husband and I juggle like all parents do.\n\nHalf term holiday is now a week away.  The kids are off for a week. We wanted to go away.  My husband was able to take the time from work, but I wasn\u2019t.  My colleague had already booked the same week and we cover each other, so our time off can\u2019t clash and I wasn\u2019t allowed the time off.\n\nIt\u2019s unusual for him because he\u2019s not got kids and usually avoids school holiday time because of the cost and he prefers the peace if he goes away. He\u2019s told me this.  Because it was a bit weird, I asked him about it.  He said he did want that week because it was a holiday with his GFs family and her sister had kids.  He\u2019d booked it first, so not a lot I could do.\n\nIt\u2019s also looking like we might not be able to get a full week together during main summer holiday, because of work clashes, so this week would have been something.\n\nWe decided that husband would take the kids away for the week.  Flights booked, everything arranged.  I\u2019m upset not to be able to go but at least they get something.  \n\nYesterday my colleague mentioned in passing his plans had  changed (a medical issue but not an emergency) and he cancelled his week.  I was sympathetic until I realised he\u2019d actually cancelled it a few weeks ago (before our trip was booked) and not told me.  He said he\u2019d not realised I wanted the week and apologised.\n\nI can\u2019t get flights now, unless I go on a different day and pay a fortune.  I\u2019m really upset.\n\nHe has now just asked me if I can swap a rostered on-call week with him later in the year for his GFs birthday (we may not get called but need to be available).  I said no and told him it was because he\u2019d stopped me going away with my kids.  He said he\u2019d had to cancel, hadn\u2019t realised it was causing me a problem and had apologised for it but I was being vindictive.\n\nHe\u2019s now found another swap so he\u2019s ok.  It has caused tension between us though.\n\nI\u2019m wondering if I\u2019m in the wrong here - I always try and take that week and asked him about it, so it should have been obvious. Even if it wasn\u2019t, surely immediately asking me for the swap was tactless. \n\nAITA?\n\nETA - when I said I asked him about it, I indicated I had wanted that week, I didn\u2019t ask him to change because he had booked it first.

School calendars are published months in advance you should have booked your time off as soon as it became available to do so. \n\nIt\u2019s also not the obligation of childless co-workers to bend their vacation schedules to accommodate yours just because you think having children gives you priority over everyone else.", "NTA.

I get why that's frustrating.  Now, whether he \\*should\\* have been oblivious or not is difficult -- something that's really obvious to you might not really have registered for him.  He's got his own stuff going on - his own life, now a girlfriend etc.  It's not necessarily reasonable to expect him to pay attention to your vacation schedule.  And punishing him for being oblivious is not likely to make him be kinder next time.  All you're really doing is setting up a situation where he won't help you, and you won't help him.  That's not going to make for easy sledding for either of you.  I would accept his apology, make one of your own, and decide that you both need to be really clear and explicit about the vacation time you want.  If you both need the same week, then maybe management needs to find coverage for that time.", "YTA, the reason why is you went out of your way to be vindictive. Yes you do not have to swap with your coworker but you made sure to go out of your way to tell them why you wouldn't swap with you. Point blank they put in the time off before you did. You also went out of your way to question them why they needed it off which isn't your business.

So yes YTA for being petty and vindictive.", "YTA- its not up to him to tell you if a vacation has been cancelled.

Now your being petty by not swapping when you can do it", "YTA.  \nI was going for not, but having kids doesn\u2019t make you automatically have (all) the school holidays.

If you and the colleague cover each other on things it is normal that he is requesting something.   \nWhile this week was maybe something that was on your mind, I can imagine he forgot your question about why he took that week.

Being petty about an unexpected change to his plans, regardless of when he found out, is a one-way ticket to never getting any support in that job now.\n\nYou've burned your bridges.\nDo what you will with that, but don't expect work to be fun, or for you to get any cover support for time off now.", "YTA - no, no it wasn't clear you had wanted that week because he can't read minds.  If he could, I doubt he would have a 9-5 job.  Also, just because you have kids does not give you ANY more say in days off than anyone else in your office.  That's where you entered into AH territory.  He doesn't work for you so he doesn't need to keep you informed on anything.  Even if it's something that's important to you.", "YTA.  You're being petty and spiteful over something that was ultimately your responsibility.\n\nYou may have to coordinate your leave to ensure adequate coverage at work, but he's your colleague not your boss and ultimately not in charge of your leave.  You must have a boss or HR or someone else you go through to actually request your leave and get it approved - it was your responsibility to keep tabs on the leave calendar or ask whoever approves leave if they would let you know if that week becomes available or there's alternate coverage allowing you to take the week.  It wasn't your coworker's responsibility to remember weeks after your conversation that you also wanted the week off - he has his own life to worry about.\n\nYou also have a crummy entitled attitude - you seem overly involved in studying your coworkers habits and judging his reasons for leave.  The fact that you questioned him about it is honestly just plain weird and none of your business.\n\nIf you actually want to do something that helps the situation, talk to your employer about instituting some kind of leave waitlist so that you can call first shot at dates you were denied if they should happen to become available or some kind of shared calendar with a waitlist signup or whatever.  Nearly every employer I've ever worked for that has to care about coverage (e.g. call centers, hospitals) had some sort of waitlist mechanism.", "NTA for not switching.

No. I'm pretty sure he had other things on his mind. Maybe, oh, his medical issue? \n\nYou're the one taking it personally and are now being vindictive.

Apologize for being petty and vindictive, and swap with him the next time he asks as soon as you can, but also talk frankly with him about how this hurt you and why, and why his request to swap afterward hurt even more.

In your situation, some would be thoughtful and considerate, others wouldn't even remember you talking about missing out on that week. \n\nThen I read your post history,  hoh boy, the entitlement and expectation that ooze out of you is strong.  \n\nI'm sorry for you missing out on family time, but you and your husband should plan well in advance, like most couples with kids do, then this situation wouldn't have even happened. \n\nYou do know that no one in work will be quick to help you accommodate your informal flexibility and emergencies in the future because of this pettiness, right?\n\nI look forward to future work related posts where you scream discrimination some more because your boss and colleagues give you even less leeway when you're playing fast and loose with your contracted conditions and policy.", "YTA", "YTA and your just digging a bigger hole by arguing.

Well done!", "YTA. You *were* being vindictive. What for?

That said, your kids will forever remember the vacation with just Dad so take comfort in that. My kids have trip/vacation memories with just one parent and they talk about those just as much as they do the whole family trips. Though till be sad, you'll get through the week, and eventually you won't be hurt over it either. You'll love their stories and happiness when they return.

This could start a completely unnecessary cycle of retaliation. YTA", "YTA\n \nAnd based on your posts and comment history, you have an overly inflated sense of entitlement and a very deflated sense of maturity.

I undersrand you have kids- but that doesnt mean you get that exact week off every single year. Also, it is NOT your coworker's job to grant vacations. At least it doesnt sound like it... If you want to be mad at anyone, take it up with management. Vacations are important and they 100% knew you wanted that time- they denied your request right? It is up to the manager to release and grant that time. Your anger is misplaced and seriously pretty.

He got that week booked off first, he can do whatever he wants with it", "Technically NTA. Neither of you are entitled to put each other out so you can get the leave you want. He didn't give up his leave for you and you don't need to change your rota for him.\n\nYour colleague is right, you are being malicious and deliberately refusing his request because you want to punish him because he booked annual leave when you wanted it. I'd hate to be stuck working with someone like you.\n\nIt's not his job to organise your life, that's your responsibility.\n\nYou would've known the term dates at the beginning of the school year. Every parent I've worked with organises their leave around term time as soon as the dates are released. You have no reason to be angry at this guy, you should be taking out your tantrum on yourself.\n\nJust keep in mind, you had the opportunity to do something for this colleague, a selfless act that would've put him in your debt.

Good luck!", "So glad that in my country the parents are actually prioritized when it comes to giving time off.", "YTA. Your mistake was telling him you were playing tit for tat. You should have just said you had plans and punish him in your own head. Now he might retaliate.", "NTA. You would be the bigger person to forgive (but not forget), but asking it right after doing that to you was thoughtless so I get the pettinesses. Given you need to cover for each other, not warning you asap was also thoughtless.", "YTA, he didn't book the week to spite you, and he doesn't have to notify you of his plans changing he's right. You were behaving vindictive in that moment and have caused tension", "YTA. Firstly, He has just as much right to have Any day of as you do, kids or no.\n\nSecondly it\u2019s not his responsibility to keep you informed of his holiday plans or if he cancels them. \n\nThirdly, if your company had decent management who ever was in charge of scheduling would have contacted you that the week was free once your colleague canceled. They are the only ones you can in anyway blame for not getting the chance after he had to cancel.", "YTA and so entitled.

And refreshingly she didn't bash him for weeks without end about how he should give her his week off because she has ChIldReN and FaMiLy. She didn't guilt trip him, she just informed him what was her previous plan and then moved on - because having children and wanting to spend time with them doesn't make you automatically an AH.\n\nTwo ways it could have went:\n1. She doesn't ask about that week again - it's her fault by your standards.\n2. She asks about it even once more - well she obviously entitled and using her family to put pressure on him.\nI don't really see how she could ever \"win\" by your standards.\n\nThis may not have been his responsibility but there is something called common courtesy and reciprocity. Apparantly only his time is important and everyone else can go fck themselves.\n\nIt's not like she asked him to help her move to a diffrent state - would it be so mentally taxing to remember your friend (collegue) from work and their annual habits?

And it's not like that discussion happened half a year before, it was just a couple of weeks.", "What kind of logic is that? Is not her responsible to track (or care about) his girlfriend either. \nShe stated that she did indicate she wanted the time off,  but he didn't do anything about it until after she had booked.", "The OP should have just taken her kids from school to go on holiday. Most people do it, especially to beat extortionate prices, and then the whole family could have gone.", "I'd agree with some of what you say but disagree with the overall judgement.\n\n>It\u2019s also not the obligation of childless co-workers to bend their vacation schedules to accommodate yours just because you think having children gives you priority over everyone else.\n\nThis is exactly right. You missed that OP didn't ask him to swap time. OP told the guy that he wanted that time but didn't ask to swap. The guy had the time and op didnt complain. \n\nThe guy then cancelled the time off and didn't tell OP. \n\nWhile that's OK it would have been really nice for the guy to come back to OP and say, you wanted that time off, hey, my plans changed and the time is free now.\n\nIt's not required but it would have been really nice of him.\n\nImagine booking christmas off in a company which makes your colleague have to work Christmas because cover. Then when Christmas comes you show up for work anyway.\n\nAt the end of the day it's a bit classless to ask someone for a favour and swapping shifts or on call time is a favour if you don't make some effort to help out when it doesn't cost you anything.", "It's not her job to accommodate the swap, either.", "Thanks.  You\u2019ve articulated this better than I did.  Honestly I would probably have done it if he\u2019d even waited a few days to ask me.  I was just so sore at that point.

But stop whining about it and request next year now.", "Why should he tell you anything? You were entitled and when spiteful. You claim school holidays being great for you so you automatically expected the holiday. When it was taken, you made arrangements. But he isn\u2019t entitled to tell you shit about his cancellation it cancellation, he is better off offering the holiday to someone who is worthy of it aka anyone but you or just not tell at all. Life doesn\u2019t revolve around you just because you made a decision ti have kids. No one owes you anything", "That doesn't solve the need to have someone look after the kids when they're on break from school, though.

Like yeah, *technically* he didn't have to tell her, but it's just common courtesy to do so when a coworker has told you about it (potentially several times).

He honestly probably just forgot since he was thinking of his week off.\n\nI know it sucks, but maybe put on his calendar that you'd like it off as a backup?   Probably a one off situation though.", "By your own account in your post, rather than express that you had interest in taking that time or asking him to let you know if his plans changed at any point, you simply asked him why he wanted the time off and called it a day. Then when his plans were cancelled and he didn't immediately think to tell you despite saying himself that he didn't know you were interested in that time, you decided to hold it against him. It's a sucky situation, sure, but it's definitely not one where you should be petty and vindictive. It's not like he set out with specific intent to keep you from going somewhere with your kids. He just didn't know you wanted that time and thus didn't realize it was important. He even apologized for the trouble caused. It's really weird energy to hold that against him.", "Maybe a conversation, like fucking well adjusted adults would.

Check your ego, your life will get better. There are resources.", "Why does the reason to say no matter? He didn\u2019t take her need/plan into consideration and why would OP has to?

In the same convo where they\u2019re upset about not being able to go on the trip with their kids because you had requested off but then canceled the time off.)

(Gets messier when there are multiple people with school aged kids in a team). There is an expectation that people without kids can settle for whatever the leftovers are, as thought their plans are less valid. So she probably didn\u2019t think she needed to plan, because she felt entitled to that week - judging by her whole post being about her sulking that he dared book leave when she wanted it.", "Not everyone is allowed to schedule vacation/off time far in advance. I've worked places that wouldn't let people schedule time off more than 30 days beforehand, though I've never completely understood why. I assume bc screwing people on hours at the last minute helped them avoid having to pay overtime/benefits?", "Exactly. I've had the same issue pop up over the years and it's amazing just how entitled people get. As such, you end up with people who get mad for not immediately thinking of them when you cancel your plans.", "Sure, but everyone knows what day you're allowed to ask for it off, and if it's every year, I would think she would have asked for it the day it was available."]}
