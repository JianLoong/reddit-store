Two weeks ago, her dad died from a sickness and she started using that fact to her advantage (ex. whenever she\u2019d act like a bitch she\u2019d say \u201cOH MY DAD DIED AND YOU WANNA TELL ME THAT?\u201d) She also poses next to her dad\u2019s casket and sends those photos to our group chat.\n\n(EDIT: For people who asked why I still hung out with her\u2014she was okay overall, we talked a few times, I wasn\u2019t really planning on doing something about her behavior before but since she was using DEATH of all things for attention, I obviously had to tell her something.) \n\nBefore you say she\u2019s probably acting out BECAUSE of the loss, again\u2014she\u2019s always been that way. She also started stealing my closest friends, guilt-tripping them into joining her hangouts when I had plans with them. \n\nWe were talking in the group chat one day, then she goes \u201cOMG guys, wrong timing..you guys know my dad died..\u201d She\u2019s been doing that for DAYS, and it\u2019s annoying since we\u2019re having fun and the next second, she ruins it. Me and my friend talked about how she was taking the death thing too far up to the point where she made it her entire personality shortly after that.\n\nEarlier today, a classmate of ours was just having fun and being noisy. Suddenly, she goes \u201cDude..my dad died, don\u2019t act that way.\u201d That was probably my last straw, so I basically told her that we get that her dad died but that doesn\u2019t mean she has to bring it up every damn time or to use that as defense in an argument. Also at some point in that argument she says her dad died (FOR THE MILLIONTH TIME) and I might have gone a tad bit too far by saying \u201cBut is he my dad?\u201d I went on and on about how she plays victim and just because she\u2019s feeling sad doesn\u2019t mean we have to since we barely knew her dad.\n\nShe started crying about it, I got kicked in the group chat, my friend left as well since he took my side. My other friend told me that I was in the wrong because she was grieving, I know people have different ways of coping but the way she was dealing with it made me so annoyed for some reason.

Her dad died TWO WEEKS AGO.  Y'all must be 12 years old to be so callous.", ">My friend had always been somewhat annoying\u2014sometimes she would go around thinking she ruled over everybody\n\nThen don't hang with her.  \n\n> **Two weeks ago**, her dad died from a sickness and she started using that fact to her advantage\n\nYTA wtf.", "YTA, you say she was always annoying, so why did you hang out with her and make her believe you're friends? If you don't like someone, fine, but no need to keep them in your friendship. There's a better way to handle the situation regarding her father. What you did was heartless and mean.\nBut then again, she is also AH for abusing the situation", "You are, but the outburst sounds understandable considering you felt slighted already. Still an asshole, but hurt people hurt people.", "Yes YTA. \n\nYes you don't have to put your life on pause but you could have at least given her some space.  Yes she might be a annoying brat but that doesn't mean she is wrong. She is trying to cope and if she was annoying brat then that is how she will cope as well. But make no mistake she is hanging on by a thread here and it will effect her for the rest of her life even when she does get back on her feet.\n\nIt just sounds like you are lucky enought to have no idea what the words pain or grief even mean compared to what she is going through right now.", "YTA. TWO WEEKS AGO??? You're unbelievably nasty. Apologise to her.", "How old is everyone? You don\u2019t beat on someone after only  two weeks. Even if it seemed like a year to you.", "You\u2019re both AH.", "ESH. \n\nSounds like your friend is millking the situation for attention. \n\nAlso, you or one of your other friends could have pulled her aside and just had a real conversation with her about it.", "Yikes...more teenage drama.  I'd say ESH.  Her for using the situation of her dad's death to manipulate you all, and you for the way you handled it. You're right, people grieve in different ways, so knowing that you could have approached her and told her about her behavior.", "ESH. She is clearly the asshole, she is not the center of the universe and people can support her while going on with their lives. What you said to her was hurtful so you might be an asshole too.", "ESH. Just because she's dealing with her dad's death in an immature way doesn't mean that she's not dealing with a big thing. Also she sounds like an arsehole.", "YWTF for sure you're", "I\u2019m going to go with ESH, I really do understand why you lost your temper, but as you said you took the situation too far. In the future, when something like this happens I would either find a time to calmly talk about it with the person, or just simply spend less time with people that treat you that way. Even though someone\u2019s dad died, you never owe anyone your company. Best of luck to you.", "ESH bc you went as far as saying 'but is he my dad' but shes not really an AH either, I mean her dad just died & people deal with death in their own way & maybe her way is to be annoying about it lol... If it makes you feel any better i dont care that your friends dad died one bit", "ESH. Absolutely, she has the right to grieve, but I'm feeling she's trying to resurface the thought for attention, but again it's kind of petty of you to be mad at her for that. I just know this is some teenage ass drama.", "Grief is wild. It comes around at unexpected times. It sounds like every time she feels another wave of it, she says out loud \"my dad died, stop doing that thing you're doing.\" \n\nHer grief is not a reason for her to try to control everyone around her. She needs someone who can focus on her feelings and really let her get them all out. Casual friendgroup is not that thing.\n\nNTA.", "NTA, why were you friends with her? Not to tell you who to be friends with ofc, but genuinely why? If she was annoying in the first place why be friends with her? I honestly think she was intentionally trying to do that to gain more attention, so in a way it was her coping mechanism. If I were her I would be very quiet and be emotional about losing him. To me she\u2019s using his death as a punchline which I\u2019ve never seen in my life. Idk if other people will disagree bc it\u2019s obviously a touchy subject, but thats just how I see it. I feel like maybe she lacking the ability to control her emotions so she\u2019s doing this for sympathy. I don\u2019t think you did anything wrong because you were frustrated, but the one thing you did wrong was being friends with someone you clearly don\u2019t like.", "ESH Though your friend sounds like the bigger one.  She sounds like she is enjoying the attention more than she is grieving.  She's going to ride that for as long as she can.  Attention is a drug to her.", "queen bee being a queen bee huh. i mean yes her dad died. but does that mean she can force anyone to not live their lifes? no. confronting her was probably not the best way out of this tho. \n\nedit: ESH", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
