Her oldest is heading to college next year and she was annoyed that we had so much money on hand and none of us went to a traditional university where we'd need the money.

As you wrote, if they knew they could have focused more on saving money for your step-siblings since you three already are financially secure for whatever you choose to do.\n\nIt's a complicated situation, but overall, I don't think it was necessarily wrong of you not to tell them. It was a gift from your uncle, on behalf of *your mum*. You don't have to share it unless you want to.

I would talk to your dad and let him know how you were feeling and why you felt the need to hide it if you haven't expressed it before. He should also understand (if he doesn't already) that his brother-in-law does not owe his current wife's kids anything.

OP wrote that the uncle told them about the money when her brother turned 18, so she and her sister would have been minors at the time.

Hopefully, it wasn't recently that they realised that college costs a lot of money and that their children might want to go... I feel like a lot of parents who are able to save money for college, usually start to do that when the kids are really young since it is so much money. \n\nI agree. I think the step mum is just jealous that her kids didn't get anything (even though it makes sense that they didn't).", "But that\u2019s not your problem, your uncle was gracious enough to save for his nieces and nephew instead of his late sister, which in turn has relieved financial stress from you dad and his wife.

Not as the family sees fit.", "Sounds like you made an accurate assessment of your dad and stepmother entitlement, and made a wise decision.", "NTA Your dad's wife has just proved the reason why it was kept from them. Because they of would of tried very hard to get it from you. You probably will have to go very LC for now or end every call the minute the subject of money comes up.", "NTA\n\n>she told us we could have shared the money or given them the chance to work hard on saving for the boys to get as much help affording college\n\nIf they had  planned for needing college money for six kids then they should have been working hard on that already. And should be grateful that they had to worry about ~~one~~ three less. And she is being pretty free with someone else's money.\n\nStepmom is the AH you always feared she would be.", "It was not for you to tell your dad.\nWas something that should have been comminicAted by uncle.", "Nta", "That was NOT your dad's money with which to \"plan accordingly\" and it was specifically set aside for you and your siblings born to your late mother. NTA", "NTA you where right to not tell them about the money. It\u2019s none of those business. You didn\u2019t take any money from them so now they can give it to the other kids in the house. Your uncle is right he does not have to give money to anyone he doesn\u2019t want too. Do not let them guilt or manipulate you all into sharing your money.", "Yes, but now they will get twice as much as they otherwise would have. That is a huge deal.", "NTA he would have tried to split your shares after uncle refusing if you were undervalued 18 NTA", "NTA. There was nothing stopping them from working hard to save for her boys. Your money is your money and they have no place in planning anything with it. Your uncle is right that he owes your step and half siblings nothing. Enjoy your money and forget your greedy, entitled stepmother and your father who needs to grow a spine and tell her to butt out. Alo, he has nothing to be disappointed over. You had valid reasons why you didn't want to tell him about the money and those reason have proven true.", "NTA. Sorry, but your step siblings and half sibling or step mother have NO right to yours, your sister or your brothers money whatsoever! They aren't your mother/uncles family, therefore that money is yours and yours alone (same for your older siblings).", "NTA", "NTA, your dad\u2019s wife is greedy.", "I\u2019m going to go with ESH for everyone but your dad, who seems least culpable in all of this.\n\nYour dad is pretty innocent, but is right to be upset that you kept something secret from him, that your uncle told you while you were still children, and that he could have been managing his finances completely differently if he knew, and set aside more money for his other children.\n\nUncle is T A for keeping this a secret from your father while telling you when you were still children. Your dad wouldn\u2019t have had the right to access any of that money, but he is still your father, and should have been. Frankly, if uncle is wealthy, he should have known some way to gift you that money, keep your father informed, and not let anyone else access it.\n\nWife doesn\u2019t have a legitimate gripe about not sharing or playing favorites, but like your dad, knowing earlier would have given them time to focus on saving for the younger kids.\n\nYou and your siblings deserve some heat too; by keeping this a secret, you took something that could have been a contentious issue and all but ensured that it did. You do get some slack for making this decision while you were young teenagers.", "NTA. If they worked on saving money for all 6 of you[.](https://kids.Now) What's the issue 3 less kids. Not your place to pay for them with money from your uncle.", "They have no right to money from someone completely unconnected to them. Has anyone explained this to them, like in words of no more than two syllables? Who on earth do they think they should have access to money that is not theirs? NTA and please don't let them get their sticky paws on any of it.", "NTA.\n\nI'm so sorry about your mom. This must be really difficult. If your dad doesn't have to spend money on you or your older siblings, he can just use the money he and your stepmom saved for your step- and half-siblings instead. Don't let your stepmom guilt you. You didn't do anything wrong. Your uncle's financial plans are his own business to share or not as he chooses.", "NTA, because honestly it sounds like you and your siblings were just trying to protect yourselves by keeping the secret. It wasn't your father's business to know about the financial situation of your uncle, especially when he would have tried to punish you and your siblings for it", "Seriously... unless it's in a specific, named education fund for you guys, can't they just take the money they were planning on spending on you and give it to her boys? Sure it won't be as much as you guys got, but turning it from a six way split to a three way is still a significant increase for all of them and that's not nothing.", "Oh so they want to hold you guys back", "NTA", "NTA If anything the other three siblings should benefit indirectly because your dad doesn\u2019t have to pay to help launch the first three and will therefore have more to give them. If, after you get established, you want to do something to help the younger kids because you do have a bond with them, that would be lovely. But they\u2019re not owed your uncle\u2019s money and you\u2019ve done nothing wrong.", "NTA. the stepmothers actions are proving why you didn\u2019t tell them.", "YTA for spilling the beans, and your Dad's wife is also TA for expecting to have a stake in money for her children who are unrelated to you/your siblings/your Dad. But ultimately the coming estrangement is mostly your fault for running your mouth. You should have kept quiet about it.", "Sooner or later they were going to find out. Your brother and sister were correct, they wanted the money for the other kids too", "I understand your father\u2019s disappointment; however, even he can see how the knowledge of these funds has caused friction so it is no wonder this information was withheld.   It is up to you what you do with your money!  At only 18, you have so much living to do and you may decide to pursue college later.  Whatever you choose , your uncle has made it possible.  Don\u2019t be intimidated, bullied or made to feel bad about the possibilities your uncle\u2019s generosity has provided.  Just let them know the issue is closed and you will resume a relationship with them after they accept this decision!  Not the asshole, just loved by your uncle!", "NTA.  This whole thing is so sad.  Why can't people just be glad they don't have to worry about ALL of their kids?!", "And your dad does have extra money for the youngest kids because he's not having to contribute to you.", "How would knowing about a promise affect the dad's finances? The money wasn't in a trust that the dad had control over, so even if he knew about it he would have had to plan as if it wasn't there. \n\nIt would have been contentious if the stepmom found out when they were minors too. And it would have been worse than it is now because she'd be able to use guilt and manipulation to try to make them promise to give her money for her children, and they'd have no where to go to escape her bullying. The dad didn't need to know about the promise to be able to save for the other children. Everything he saved for the older 3 can now be funneled to the younger ones. And he and his wife still have time to add more to whatever that amount is. If he had $60k saved for 6 kids and now only has to split it 3 ways, each kid gets $20k instead of $10k. How does he not come out ahead?", "Again not your problem and not your mom's family's problem", "NTA. She should look at it as a positive they saved for 6 and only have to maybe pay for 3.", "NTA. Whatever money they saved for all 5 now gets to go to just 3. The money came with the stipulation that you not talk about it. His wife is entitled to absolutely nothing. Life isn't fair.", "No, your dad and stepmom are entitled assholes, wowwwwww! That is your money, on behalf of your late mother, they have absolutely no say so here and I'm going to guess the reason that this money was kept from them is quite possibly because your uncle had a suspicion of what would happen!", "NTA Your Stepmom, and Dad could have been saving for college for the past 16 years. Keeping this money a secret had no effect on this. They failed to prepare without knowing that there was any money coming for anyone. They would have had less incentive if they thought there was money available.\n\nYour Uncle provided for his relatives which is wonderful. That would make the burden of college less for your parents. That is 3 whole college funds they didn't have to worry about. What a blessing. They should be so grateful to your Uncle for this. Instead they expect the Uncle to pay for everyone's college, and let the parents off the hook for not planning for college for anyone.\n\nIf you had told your parents about this fund. They would have wanted to take it from you and disperse it among all the kids if they could. They would have at least harassed the Uncle. Truthfully your withholding this information did no harm to anyone, and it actually postponed any negative turmoil for a while at least. There would always be drama because your parents want access to your uncles money.\n\nDon't let anyone manipulate you into giving away any money. No one is entitled to it but those it was intended for.", "NTA.  I particularly don't understand the part where they claim they could have saved money for the other boys better if they'd known you were covered.  Those kids are all younger than you, it's not like they have chosen cheaper schools or forgone college so that you could go.  They haven't gone to college at all yet, so the money your dad has been able to save will only have *more* impact for them.", "It makes me wonder what he meant by saying he would have \u201cplanned accordingly\u201d if he knew about your money. Does he mean he would have planned to use it for the other kids? Because I can\u2019t think of a scenario where you\u2019d be disappointed to learn half of your kids have their college paid for. I can\u2019t think of any reason why this would throw your plans off."]}
