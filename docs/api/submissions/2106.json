Her oldest is heading to college next year and she was annoyed that we had so much money on hand and none of us went to a traditional university where we'd need the money.

He told them we were his nephew and nieces and the other kids were not his family and were not getting anything from him.\n\nBut my siblings and I have also gotten shit for keeping the money from dad and not being open about it so they could plan accordingly. Dad seems more disappointed than mad but his wife is straight pissed about it and she told us we could have shared the money or given them the chance to work hard on saving for the boys to get as much help affording college like we got from our uncle.

I don't know why he gave you the money, but if it was on behalf of your mum, then I'm guessing she wanted you to have it so you would get a good start in life and wouldn't have to choose to not go to college due to financial reasons.\n\nIt might have saved some drama if your dad had been told about it, but that should probably have been your uncle's job since he's the one giving you money. As you wrote, if they knew they could have focused more on saving money for your step-siblings since you three already are financially secure for whatever you choose to do.\n\nIt's a complicated situation, but overall, I don't think it was necessarily wrong of you not to tell them. It was a gift from your uncle, on behalf of *your mum*. You don't have to share it unless you want to. And based on what you have written, it doesn't sound like you were asking your dad for money to go to college/buy a home even though you knew that you didn't need any money from him (so it's not like you *\"took\"* money that could have been given to your step-siblings).", "NTA.\n\nYour uncle can do with his money as he pleases.\n\nYou are under no obligation to disclose any part of this to anyone else, as far as I can tell.\n\nYour step-mum just sounds bitter that her kids don't have the same opportunity. Whilst I understand her perspective, that's not *your* fault!\n\nYour dad and his new wife are TAs for being mad at you. Your dad ESPECIALLY should have been a responsible adult and discussed things like this with his departed wife's family. Presumably your dad knew that your uncle was wealthy? Why didn't he talk to him after your mum's passing, and figure out what was happening? Then he could have made other plans for his \"new\" kids? Your dad is the biggest AH here.\n\nEither way, nta. Sorry your family are being buttholes <3", "NTA. It's your uncle's money to do with as he sees fit. I can understand why your dad might be disappointed because no parent likes to feel that their own children don't trust them. However, your step mother's reaction validates, after the fact, your and your siblings' decision not to share this information with your dad and step-mom. Someone might tell her that, now that the three of you are not going to uni, there is more money (from your dad) to spread out among the younger siblings who decide to go.", "NTA your uncle kindly gave you guys money spend it guilt free.", "No. NTA. Dad's new wife is jealous. You all were probably right in your initial thought that it was better not to say anything.", "NTA - The second she finds out there is money she felt entitled to it, you were definitely right to keep it from them. And as for school money don't they have more if your dad set aside money for 6 kids to attend school if 3 of you don't need it?", "Step moms reaction is exactly why you were right to keep the money secret. And if they say anything else just point to her reaction and say \u201cthis is the reason we were right too\u201d. NTA", "NTA. You had a gut feeling and you were right. I would ask your step-mother why she feels entitled to (essentially) a stranger's money... that was saved up for his nieces and nephews. Just because it feels like a \"waste\" to her that you're all not using it on college, doesn't mean her kids are next in line to seize this opportunity. I would talk to your dad and let him know how you were feeling and why you felt the need to hide it if you haven't expressed it before. He should also understand (if he doesn't already) that his brother-in-law does not owe his current wife's kids anything. He should not side with her on this issue but I understand parents have a way of justifying certain actions/behaviors for their kids sake. It's all just strange and stinks of greed. Good luck OP.", "NTA Don\u2019t know how this has caused any issues with money for college for dad and step mum because now they have more to spend on the other siblings education. If anything they should be happy, not sure how it\u2019s not OPs fault they hadn\u2019t already been saving as much as possible when they had 6 potential children to send to college", "Nta. It honestly stuns me how people think they are entitled to something that has nothing to do with them. Your mothers family is in no way obligated to help with your step mothers children or your fathers.  You are in no way obligated to give any money you have to anyone else for any reason. She should be grateful that all the money they say they saved for the 6 of you is now doubled for the remaining three. Your step mother needs to realize that the burden of her 3 children does not fall to another family.", "NTA\n\nIf they had money saved in some way for all of you to pay towards college, then they should be extremely grateful that yours and your full siblings share of the pot isn't needed and that instead of having to split it between 6, they only need to split it between 3. Basically half of the pot has been freed up.\n\nI really, really hate it when step parents believe that they should be/are entitled to what the kids bio family gives them. They are not. \n\nAs I have said before in a similar post, your uncle is doing/providing what your mum would have if she was alive. If she was, would they be expecting her to pay for your steps/half brothers education? The answer is no or it should be. Your uncle/maternal family has no duty or obligation to provide for your dads other kids. He chose to take those kids on and have another. It is up to he and his wife to provide for them, not your uncle.", "NTA.  Your stepmom and dad had ample opportunity to save for your step sibling\u2019s college.  Your decision to keep it a secret was right as your stepmom\u2019s reaction is exactly what you were trying to avoid.", "NTA, the money could have been brow beaten out of the kids, with the step mother keeping ALL the money for HER kids.  It\u2019s your uncle\u2019s choice who the money goes to.  Glad step mother did get her greedy hands on it.", "NTA it is your uncle\u2019s money to do with as he wants. He is not related to any of the other kids so he \u201cowes\u201d them nothing. It is now your money and you do not need to give any to your dad or half/step siblings. Do not give them access to any of the money. You and siblings may still decide to use it for education for yourselves. Your father now only needs to figure out college money for 3.", "NTA. They have no right to that money. And what does she mean if you had told them it would have given them the chance to work hard so the other kids would have had something comparable? They should have been doing that anyway. They should be happy they could refocus all the money they had saved solely on the other kids. All they did was prove you did the right thing by harassing you and your uncle. Stay away from them.", "NTA. \n\nAt the end of the day, your dad and stepmother bow have more money to spend on your half siblings? \n\nSo everybody wins, surely? \n\nAnd your uncle is right, you're his family, they are not. It's simple as that.", "NTA.", "NTA,  I don't blame you at all for keeping it quiet. I'm sure you would much have your mother than your uncles money. \n\nYour stepmother is way out of line.

It's sad how money can drive a wedge in families.", "NTA. It\u2019s not her money, she doesn\u2019t get a say. \n\nWhat\u2019s the problem? Your dad and step mom supposedly saved for 6 and now they only need to save for 3, sounds like her kids get to benefit too.", "NTA\n\nThey didn't need to know about the money to \"plan accordingly\" because it isn't their money to plan for.  The money was gifted to you and your siblings only and is for your benefit.  You Dad and his wife should be happy to split Dad's savings between only three kids.  That should help your stepbrother to get started at community college.", "How does you having \u201csecret\u201d money prevent the parents from saving money and planning for college for all of the kids?

He can use the money they saved for the other kids. \n\n>his wife is straight pissed about it and she told us we could have shared the money or given them the chance to work hard on saving for the boys to get as much help\n\nNo, you are not going to share the money. Again, they can take any money saved for you three and give it to the other kids. NTA.", " YTA for keeping it from Dad i think.  and he was bound to find out anyway, making this moment even more uncomfortable.  also he\u2019d been trying to figure out how he could help all of his kids. telling him would\u2019ve taken 3 of you out of the picture- making that whole process easier on him. and i bet your Dad feels somewhat sad and disrespected that you keep this info from him\n\nas far as step mom goes, she can whine and nag all she wants.  she and her offspring are not entitled to a penny. however with you 3 out of financial need - there\u2019s more for everyone else.   she\u2019s gonna have to settle for that", "Right? Now they can be a little less stressed about money because they know that three of the children are already taken care of, which means that they don't have to split the money they have saved on six children but on three.", "I agree. It\u2019s especially difficult when it\u2019s abusive family asking you for money. \n\nI remember when I got my inheritance, I couldn\u2019t give any to my mom because she\u2019d then give it to my abusers (my aunts and grandma). They knew that she\u2019d just roll over and give them every last penny, so I made sure that she had no access to any of it - I always had to know what she wanted to buy, and know exactly what it was being used for. If I caught her giving away anything to the family, I wouldn\u2019t get her anything else. \n\nAnd this royally pissed her off, especially since I wasn\u2019t just giving her the actual money and had to be there if she wanted anything. The family was also obviously angry about this, saying I was selfish and didn\u2019t care about anyone but myself\u2026after I spent everything, they all finally left me alone.", "This is the right answer. Stepmom should be pleased they didn\u2019t have to spend as much money for the children from the first marriage. Her birth children can now use that. \n\nThey are not entitled to the money from the first wife\u2019s relatives. I get it. She\u2019s jealous for her own kids. But they aren\u2019t related to that uncle.\n\nNTA for op.", "The planning part doesn\u2019t make sense to me though. The step siblings are just about to start college or are still in high school. If anything, the parents should be now over-planned as they don\u2019t have to pay for tuition for the first three kids.  Therefore, if parents planned right, they should be in a really good spot and be able to afford the step siblings\u2019 tuitions better.   \n\nIt just sounds like an excuse for step mom to be angry when she\u2019s just jealous.", "Yeah, but not as much as we have from our uncle. I think that's where the problem lies for her.", "I think it's because they have but they would never be able to get anywhere close to what my brother, sister and I have. Even with all the savings they have made.", "That's a good point. Although, I think the uncle should have told the dad, to be honest. OP wrote that the uncle told them about the money when her brother turned 18, so she and her sister would have been minors at the time. Money has a very strong tendency to create problems/disagreements, and the uncle should have known that this could potentially create some tension in the family since his nephew and nieces aren't the only children.", "Exactly! On one hand I do understand dad feeling blindsided that everyone kept it from him. It would\u2019ve been nice if all the parties could have had a conversation about this. Unfortunately, we know all too well how often the step-parent and widow/widower start demanding equal shares. The entitlement of people I read about here is astounding.", "That's a good point. Hopefully, it wasn't recently that they realised that college costs a lot of money and that their children might want to go... I feel like a lot of parents who are able to save money for college, usually start to do that when the kids are really young since it is so much money. \n\nI agree. I think the step mum is just jealous that her kids didn't get anything (even though it makes sense that they didn't).", "But that\u2019s not your problem, your uncle was gracious enough to save for his nieces and nephew instead of his late sister, which in turn has relieved financial stress from you dad and his wife. Also is your dads wife ex contributing to his kids college funds at all. Your dad and his wife should be happy knowing that you guys are able to go into life without that stress financially, and honestly just get over it because life isn\u2019t fair and not every gets a equal slice of the pie.", "oh - better point - the uncle definitely should have told the dad.", "In a way, the kids did a favor to dad. If they told him, he would have to share the info with his wife.  He would have been forced to take sides. With op and the other children from the first marriage out of the house, this means dad has no decision making power and doesn\u2019t have to take sides.", "Yeah... I really don't get how the stepmother thinks that she has any ground here... The money was gifted on behalf of their late mother, and she had never met the step mum or her children so why would she ever give money to them? It's just pure entitlement and greed on the stepmother's part.", "My stepsiblings dad is not involved in any way and has never contributed anything. His family isn't involved either.", "Well that honestly sucks, but just proves they should worked hard on saving for college as she said they would have if they had know all about the money your uncle set aside for you. Tbh you and your siblings have done nothing but the right thing by the poor way your dad and wife have acted, and I would consider going NC if they continue the way they are"]}
