I (30s F) come from a country where it is customary to wash your bottom after you go number two. It is a standard practice like in many other countries, and every household has bathrooms with bidets. I currently live in an european country where it is not that common, but you can still find a few houses that do have a bidet, and some people here wash, and others wipe, but neither choice is strange to the other group. I happen to live in a house with 2 bathooms: a small one with a toilet and a sink, and a large one that also has bathtub and a bidet. When I have guests, I usually point them to the small bathroom but only because is closer to the area we usually hang out.\n\n  \nLast weekend my wife (40s) and I had a bunch of friends over for a bbq since the weather is nice and we have a terrace. One of my friends brought Kelly (30s, not real name) who is from the US and I've never met before. Everything was going well and I thought Kelly was nice. I was grilling sausages and at one point I take one out to give it to someone and I drop it on Kelly's feet, who was wearing flip flops. I appologise profusely and handed Kelly a napkin, she said not to worry but she preferred to wash, so she leaves while I stay in the terrace cleaning the floor. \n\n  \nShe comes back a moment later and comments on \"how cute that our bathroom has a little feet washer\". My wife and I were like what? and when she repeats I say \"Oh you mean the bidet?\" Kelly did not know what a bidet was, and when I explained to her she was shocked, and asked if we actually use it to wash after going to the toilet, and I say that my wife doesn't (she's from a country where this is not common) but I do, and that's when she lost it. She got agitated and furious and asking how come we didn't tell her? To which I said I've never had to explain to anyone what a bidet was before. She said we should've warned her, that we need to warn our guests that I wash my behind there, that it is not \"normal\" and that I was an AH. I started naming some of the many, many countries that do wash as a cultural norm while also stating that here, even if people don't have one, everyone knows what it is, but she completely went nuts when she realized that the little towel hanging next to it is for drying my bottom. Seems like she used it to dry her feet and hands. \n\n  \nShe left shortly after, along with my friend. I don't think I did anything wrong, my wife thinks the same, but my friend said that I should've apologised and another friend said she understood Kelly's point. AITA??

I hope she apologizes to you.", "Her ignorant mind probably thought \u201coh you can poop and wash your feet simultaneously\u201d", "I'm not gonna lie I thought that until I was in probably my mid teens because I'm in the UK and bidets aren't very common so whenever I saw one in a hotel on holiday I thought they were foot washers. But as an adult I find it hilarious that someone wouldn't piece it together especially since OP is in a country that uses bidets.", "\"This contraption in the bathroom at asshole level must be for washing feet!\"", "Well, it can be used to wash feet, just not dry with the butt towel \ud83d\ude05", "That\u00b4s exactly what I thought! \n\nThe ASS washer is located next to the toilet not the FOOT washer\n\nKelly learned today haha", "Until recently, I had never seen a standalone bidet (I'm in my 30s) *however* I also don't touch things in other people's homes if I'm not 100% certain what the hell it is. I would have laughed at myself, said \"Oh shit!\", laughed at the double meaning, and then gone back to wash properly.", "I did say bidet attachments in our home. However, I think most of us have seen the standalone bidets either in fancy hotels, in the movies/tv, etc.", "I think they just meant that they have bidet attachments on all the toilets in their home, not that every toilet in their area has one.", "I mean the water is clean anyway and you use it to spray from a distance you don't touch it with your butt sooooo even using it to wash your feet (while weird) wouldn't be a bad thing, just cleaning a different body part\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUsing the butt towel to dry off is a different story though", "I've seen them in hotels in Europe.  \n\nAlways seemed more practical to me to just use toilet paper to dry after bidet, but it could work if you're willing to risk...incidents.", "Or, you know, wipe your feet with a paper towel or something.", "It might be one of those that is a hose attached to the wall near the toilet", "Not used a bidet since mate!", "Right, but you think an American would know more about a foot washing sink but not a bidet?", "I have never seen such a device. No thanks to that lol. Is it hand-held? Where does the water go?", "I had a  a foot washer in my mud room at my old place up north to wash feet/ shoes and such. It is like a floor sink.", "Yea I\u2019m kind of having trouble believing someone would assume a bidet is something to was your feet with?? Maybe this is a style of bidet I\u2019m not used to but seems kind of a weird conclusion to come to even if you didn\u2019t know what it was..very odd.", "Tbf I\u2019m from Ireland and the first time I was in Greece as a child I thought it was a foot wash for sand after the beach until my mother explained but I was like 6 but just saying it happens", "Jesus was a feet washer. \ud83e\udd23", "\nOne dunny, one bidet.\n\nBidday?It's for... after you... you know...You figure it out.- See you at seven.\n\nYeah.\n\n(LOUD WHISTLE)\n\nFor washing your backside, right? \ud83e\udd23", "Its sad for me to say that Bluey is the reason why I know what a dunny is \ud83e\udd23", "Also feet were on her mind as she needed to clean then. There is nothing wrong with her not knowing. She's the asshole for then lashing out.", "We have warm water for the bidet same as the sink, don't you??\n\nBTW here every house has one, we use it to wash feet too and even used to wash children when small LOL the trick is to keep it always clean and disinfected, that place is surely cleaner than my keyboard", "You'd be amazed how many people probably never wash their behinds properly.", "Ah, sorry I misread.", "yep.", "Yeah it was weird to use the towel there. I agree using the bidet itself isnt thst big a deal but now she has booty on her hands and feet.\n\nShes a dummy", "Yeah. I feel like continually using the same towel and just leaving it hanging there is unhygienic as fuck.

You can\u2019t mistake a bidet to that. Shes just ignorant and lashed out of embarrassment. NTA", "I highly doubt Kelly knew about those, either tbh.", "I thought it was a short sink for children. I then couldn't turn the taps on it off so had to go and get my aunt and uncle and explain. Still mortified", "I also thought that the Bidet was to wash your feet and was getting angry that it was at an inconvenient hight for me. I was 6 and it was at knee level. \nI wonder what that friend expected? A sign next to the mail box with \"we wash our asses here?\"\nAnd how rude of her to just enter the master bathroom.", "Lol you were a child, this was a grown adult. Even in the US I am surprised if someone does not know what a bidet is.", "I'm American and I looooove a bidet. I had one with a female wash. There's nothing like getting pounded into the mattress and that ice cold water after, or just blasting yourself on a hot summer day. Refreshing", "Lol even the sink water comes out cold af at first in winter. Some of the houses here just have ancient plumbing.", "English is not my first language, so this might have gotten lost in translation, but WTF is a poop knife??!", "Precisely. Was just letting them know it's a thing.", "I\u2019m guessing op had a bum gun style of bidet", "I was lucky to be well travelled not everyone is not saying it\u2019s an excuse for her outburst just understanding why she mightened be aware", "I can assure you that you don't really want to know about it.
