I (30s F) come from a country where it is customary to wash your bottom after you go number two. It is a standard practice like in many other countries, and every household has bathrooms with bidets. I currently live in an european country where it is not that common, but you can still find a few houses that do have a bidet, and some people here wash, and others wipe, but neither choice is strange to the other group. I happen to live in a house with 2 bathooms: a small one with a toilet and a sink, and a large one that also has bathtub and a bidet. When I have guests, I usually point them to the small bathroom but only because is closer to the area we usually hang out.\n\n  \nLast weekend my wife (40s) and I had a bunch of friends over for a bbq since the weather is nice and we have a terrace. One of my friends brought Kelly (30s, not real name) who is from the US and I've never met before. Everything was going well and I thought Kelly was nice. I was grilling sausages and at one point I take one out to give it to someone and I drop it on Kelly's feet, who was wearing flip flops. I appologise profusely and handed Kelly a napkin, she said not to worry but she preferred to wash, so she leaves while I stay in the terrace cleaning the floor. \n\n  \nShe comes back a moment later and comments on \"how cute that our bathroom has a little feet washer\". My wife and I were like what? and when she repeats I say \"Oh you mean the bidet?\" Kelly did not know what a bidet was, and when I explained to her she was shocked, and asked if we actually use it to wash after going to the toilet, and I say that my wife doesn't (she's from a country where this is not common) but I do, and that's when she lost it. She got agitated and furious and asking how come we didn't tell her? To which I said I've never had to explain to anyone what a bidet was before. She said we should've warned her, that we need to warn our guests that I wash my behind there, that it is not \"normal\" and that I was an AH. I started naming some of the many, many countries that do wash as a cultural norm while also stating that here, even if people don't have one, everyone knows what it is, but she completely went nuts when she realized that the little towel hanging next to it is for drying my bottom. Seems like she used it to dry her feet and hands. \n\n  \nShe left shortly after, along with my friend. I don't think I did anything wrong, my wife thinks the same, but my friend said that I should've apologised and another friend said she understood Kelly's point. AITA??

NTA", "NTA, just be glad that she didn't think it was a low drinking fountain.", "NTA I don't know anyone here in the US that would look at a bidet and think oh neat a little foot washer. Kelly is extremely ignorant.", "NTA\n\nSounds like ignorance on her part. Also, why assume that a thing you've never seen before (the bidet) is a feet washer?", "You're NTA and \"Kelly\" is a mahoosive weirdo!", "NTA, how in the world does washing one's behind come up in normal conversation?  \"Hi, Bob, how is your wife and kids, Oh by the way I wash my behind.\"?", "NTA. Your friend is a tad ignorant and turned her embarrassment at this into anger. If anyone should apologise it should be her. She made the decision to assume after all.", "> the little towel hanging next to it is for drying my bottom\n\nWhat...? A re-useable towel for ass-wiping? Even after rinsing your crack with water from the bidet, that seems dirty and disgusting. Is this a normal practice? I think I might be leaning toward Y T A because of the disgusting towel you have in your bathroom.\n\nI have a bidet attachment on my toilet but after I use it, I use regular toilet paper to dry/wipe myself off and then I discard it.", "NTA. What was she even angry about? It's just an honest mistake because she did not know... She could've gone back and washed her hands and feet with soap and moved on from it like an adult. She said that you should've told her first but that would be like going around and announcing about some branded toilet paper. It's just weird and why would anyone say that unless specifically asked?", "NTA\n\nMy first reaction: Hahaha XD\n\nMy second reaction: Enter a new culture and be angry at people that you were not informed of something that is obvious to that culture.\n\nPS I am sure the first time I saw w bidet was in the US.", "Lmaoooooo. You are NTA in any way. And at least you found out that you needed to change your towel since her sausage feet had been on it. \n\nReactions like hers is the reason that other countries don\u2019t like Americans, unfortunately. She was very rude to come in to your home and make you question yourself for her ignorance.", "As someone from the US who lives in a state that is behind the times... even I know what a bidet is and own one. You are NTA. She is just embarrassed. And that is hilarious, at least she didn't think it was a water fountain. \ud83e\udd23", "Very concise American screen name as well", "My canadian bottom is also squeaky clean.", "They are becoming so much more common in the US.  It\u2019s also a common joke in a lot of movies/tv shows where American folks travel abroad.  It\u2019s not OP\u2019s fault that Kelly didn\u2019t know about them.  NTA.", "I\u2019m from the US, never used a bidet, everyone knows what it is and what it looks like. She\u2019s honestly quite dumb to assume that it\u2019s for washing your feet. Never heard of a separate foot washing station in a restroom from any culture. It would make more sense to assume it\u2019s for your behind. She should\u2019ve just asked or used the sink. Angry because she looked/sounded ignorant and didn\u2019t want to admit her fault. Should\u2019ve laughed it off, gone back and washed her feet/hands and moved on.", "But bidets are meant to be used for multiple things, feet washing among the top of them. It's just a low mounted sink. I used to soak laundry in mine as well.", "I don\u2019t even know how you see a bidet and think \u201cwow, this contraption right next to the toilet *must* be for cleaning feet.\u201d", "They made a joke about this in Crocodile Dundee which was like 1984. Due to toilet paper shortages, a lot of Americans installed bidets.", "\u201cHey everybody! Welcome to my personal property. Please be advised that we have, in our private master bath, a device that is used for washing your ass. Please do not use it for activities other than washing your ass. Thanks, and enjoy the potato salad- as long as you don\u2019t use the towel next to the bidet as your napkin, LOL!\u201d", "this is the comment \ud83d\udc4f", "Just throw the one towel into the dirty clothes when people come over.  No need for a sign advertising your poop towel.", "It's very refreshing in winter when the water runs in cold no matter what lol", "And I would think a bidet would still be more common that a feet washer. I have never heard of a feet washer.", "There\u2019s a bidet joke in one of the Bring It on movies", "Yeah it\u2019s a weird thing not to know (which happens, I\u2019m often surprised by simple things people do not understand) and it was very rude to get mad at OP about *your* lack of understanding. It was a dumb mistake, just take the L and laugh it off.", "When I first heard of them I also thought that's what they're for... Probably because of the name - pedes means feet in latin and I only heard the name \"bidet\" spoken but not written. So I don't think the assumption that it has something to do with feet is that far fetched.", "[removed]", "I thought they were for washing your feet when I was a kid, but to still come to that conclusion as an adult, and then get mad at being corrected, is a bit dim", "Why would washing your feet in the bidet be any different from a hygiene perspective from washing them in the shower/tub where people clean their full bodies - including their behind? \n\nI have never used a bidet but as far as I know it\u2019s not like you shove the hose up anywhere or leave residue in the bowl?", "I used to think bidets were for feet. Then again I was in elementary school and visiting the UK for the first time. I asked my mother what the thing next to the toilet was for. She said it was for washing down there, which my elementary school mind decided that meant washing your feet. I think I was in high school or college before I learned the real use since bidets are not common in the US.", "You see, when you flush, particles splash out and if you stand there watching to make sure it flushes, the foot washing station is there to clean your feet.\n\nThat's the best I could come up with. The first part about the particles is true though. Close your lids when you flush.", "This made me lol a bit", "To be fair I have used my bidet to soak my feet in warm water after a long day.", "that's when we got ours! i love it, wouldn't go without one ever again. we even have one in our RV.", "What's a poop knife?", "I wish it was only winter.  Our water is ice cold even in the summer.  No one will use it except for me.  Need one that adds warm water.", "Lots of Muslim oriented places have them as it's required to wash your feet before you pray.", "When I was a kid and first saw one in a bathroom showroom that's what I thought it was lol I was asking my parents why someone would need a special sink to wash their feet", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

Like, I get being kinda geossed out at the idea of using toilet water to wash your feet, but not to the point that she did.", "I thought they usually used a bowl of water for that. But even if they have an actual feet washer, would it be in the bathroom next to the toilet? To me that would seem like a weird place for it.", "https://wudumate.com/wudu-foot-baths/\n\nhttps://images.app.goo.gl/HVTQs7m1JThMw9NCA"]}
