And I got more than I bargained for.\n\nBasically, the friend denied ever saying I was hitting on her and said my wife took it out of context/misheard her. My wife argued back saying the opposite, that friend said I was making moves on her and flirting. According to friend, her words were along the lines of \"your husband was very nice to me and had it been any other person, I would think they're flirting\". Honestly there was a lot of back and forth about what was actually said but it the end, it was established that I had infact not flirted with her friend.\n\nHowever, because of this argument, things were heated and things were said. What got me is when her friend revealed to me that my wife was very insecure and had been keeping tabs on me, checking my phone every now and then without my knowledge, and quote \"searching my car and laundry for any feminine products/scents that didn't belong to her every so often\". Apparently she's been confiding all this to her friends and at some point even considered having one of her friends flirt with me to see what I would do. \n\nNeedless to say, i'm speechless and very disappointed. It's only now that I realize there wasn't any trust ever in this marriage and I'm only going to continue suffering because her sister's failed marriage. She's tried apologizing and denying, synonymously, to the point where I'm confused what she's apologizing for and what she's denying. I was tempted to give her the same treatment she gave me based on an accusation but to be honest, I really don't have the energy. As of now, I've asked for some space to contemplate this entire marriage.\n\nThanks for everyone for the support and advice. It really means a lot. It seems like a lot of you were right. I think I'll take it from here. Again, thank you so much.

Take your time to figure out what is best for you. Good luck, OP.", "Wow OP! She's projected her insecurity so hard it contaminated her friends view of you and /or the friend decided to fake the 'loyalty test' for her?\n\nSounds like she needs a NC time out, for the health of your relationship and your wife needs a therapist to vent to instead of sh!t stirring friends.\n\nGood luck my dude, thanks for the update!", "OP I am so sorry it has come to this but this is good it came out now.   \nBest wishes with this new chapter", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour wife is a mess and a major AH. Consider a divorce.", "You should consider if it\u2019s still worth it t be married to her", "These are some disturbing behaviors and it may be a reaction of her sister\u2019s situation or her own insecurities. If you stay in the relationship you need to be very careful as these insecurities could lead her to cheat as a way of \u201cdoing it before it\u2019s done to her\u201d. It seems a lot of time people who cheat start projecting that onto the SO due to guilt.", "I'm really sorry you are going through all this.", "Talk about projecting! Damn\u2026 your wife could give a movie theater a run for there money! My advice OP in the words of one of my favorite movies \u201cRun Forrest, Run!\u201c When I read the first post my initial thought was \u201cDid the friend say that or is she projecting her Sister\u2019s situation onto herself?\u201d So not only does she accuse you of hitting on her friend \ud83d\udea9but she also twisted her friends words to make that accusation \ud83d\udea9. When you refused to take accountability for something you didn\u2019t do, she tried to \u201cpunish\u201d you by trying to make you sleep on the couch \ud83d\udea9. When you slept in the spare room, she was pissed it wasn\u2019t on the couch, implying she wanted you to be uncomfortable \ud83d\udea9. Her friend reveals she goes through your phone and keeps \u201ctabs\u201d on you\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "Damn, what a nightmare.  Trust is clearly the issue for her here and I see why you don't want to be in a marriage with someone who can't/won't trust you.\n\nI think she should see a therapist, she won't be able to just turn this off.  For the sake of your marriage I hope she agrees to try and get help to work on her trust issues.  Best of luck", "Tbh Im was waiting for the moment where you told her to go sleep on the couch to think about what she\u2019s done lol.\n\nShe\u2019s a walking timebomb,  everyone she knows is getting a dose of her disturbed behaviour and its not looking good for her.  You need to get more than space from her.  Be careful, she might be following you around and keeping tabs on you while your taking space.", "So what if your wife is. If you have nothing to hide and she finally figures That out, then eventually it won't bother her and she will trust you. My friend would do this to her husband only because she was cheated on by her ex. However, when I asked her current guy and how he felt, he made a valid point. \" I have nothing to hide and if it helps her to relax, so be it\". Now that is love.", "If you want to continue in the marriage you have to insist she gets some therapy for herself and maybe couples therapy for both wouldn't hurt. If this is the only major issue ya had in the marriage then there is no harm in trying to fix it.", "NTA your wife needs mental help. Your marriage is over...run run fast don't look hack. Your wife is crazy", ">it contaminated her friends view of you\n\nThe way I'm reading it, the friend didn't actually accuse OP of anything at all, but OP's wife is determined to find evidence of cheating somewhere because she's so worried about what happened to her sister happening to her.", "This.. shes a Major Red Flag", "What\u2019s worse is when they confront friend, and she tells wife she\u2019s wrong. The wife still can\u2019t accept it, so it devolves into the ending. Major red flags.", "No, that is called to be a doormat and accept controling behavior. It's harmful and did you see what his wife did to him when she was paranoid that he flirted with her friend? She never \"figure It out\", she'll keep acusing him of doing things he didn't do.It's harmful and no one needs to submit to that. Wifey can Go to theraphy for her issues or being single .", "Kind of a selffulfilling prophecy\u2026 pushing someone \u201cbecause they are going to hurt me or leave me or cheat on me\u201d until they actually do leave\u2026 \nOP, I am so sad to hear this is happening to you. Don\u2019t look for any blame by yourself. You did nothing wrong and this is a problem of your partner."]}
