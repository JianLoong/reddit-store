And I got more than I bargained for.\n\nBasically, the friend denied ever saying I was hitting on her and said my wife took it out of context/misheard her. My wife argued back saying the opposite, that friend said I was making moves on her and flirting. According to friend, her words were along the lines of \"your husband was very nice to me and had it been any other person, I would think they're flirting\". Honestly there was a lot of back and forth about what was actually said but it the end, it was established that I had infact not flirted with her friend.\n\nHowever, because of this argument, things were heated and things were said. What got me is when her friend revealed to me that my wife was very insecure and had been keeping tabs on me, checking my phone every now and then without my knowledge, and quote \"searching my car and laundry for any feminine products/scents that didn't belong to her every so often\". Apparently she's been confiding all this to her friends and at some point even considered having one of her friends flirt with me to see what I would do. \n\nNeedless to say, i'm speechless and very disappointed. It's only now that I realize there wasn't any trust ever in this marriage and I'm only going to continue suffering because her sister's failed marriage. She's tried apologizing and denying, synonymously, to the point where I'm confused what she's apologizing for and what she's denying. I was tempted to give her the same treatment she gave me based on an accusation but to be honest, I really don't have the energy. As of now, I've asked for some space to contemplate this entire marriage.\n\nThanks for everyone for the support and advice. It really means a lot. It seems like a lot of you were right. I think I'll take it from here. Again, thank you so much.

She's projecting her fears of being abandoned onto you, to force you into a situation where you will abandon her and validate her fears... My wife did similar, only she instead convinced her friends I was a worthless bum.  coles notes version: I was laid off, found a new better job a week later, didn't even miss a paycheque.  But to read her messages to her friends... 6 months later I wasn't even looking for a new job the entire 6 months, was lazing about at home doing nothing, not even helping clean the house etc among other things, we were behind on bills etc etc etc (anything to gain sympathy).  When I had been at my new job for 6 months and had gotten a $10k raise in that time... That never made it to her friends ears who she wanted sympathy from.

There were also many infidelity accusations, and \"I'd rather be with 'some random woman' I worked with than her\" (female coworkers were a particular sticking point with her)\n\nNow, I'm not saying this to scare you away, but there are methods to go through to help with this.  It wasn't until I was forced to a counselling session by my work for \"work-life balance issues\" (aka she'd call and yell at me at work randomly throughout the day for various perceived slights) that the psychologist after hearing my story, told me to look into Borderline Personality Disorder and read up on it.  it took some time for me to heed that advice, but once I did, I found a book, \"Stop walking on Eggshells\"  which was literally explaining my every day life, it provided tools to help my sanity, help our marriage, and tools to help her get the help she needs. because she wouldn't have gotten the help if I hadn't insisted.  \n\nFor what it's worth, the last 12 years have been mostly good.  we've been married for 17 years now, I was ready to leave multiple times in the first 5 years.

You will now be wondering if she went through your phone/laptop again, if she is tracking your car, etc. your wife is projecting too much onto the relationship that she is just damaging it to a point that now there is no trust between the two of you and she made her friendship more toxic than before. Just because it happened to her sister in the past doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s gonna happen to her but she went ahead and acted like you were cheating and look what came to head now.", "Probably because she saw the opportunity and took it. The wife has been insecure for a looooong time and doesnt trust op one bit, friend knew where the cracks were and aimed for them", "My first thought was what role do her \u201cfriends \u201c play in her insecurity. They sound like they are the type of people who are miserable and are doing their best to make everyone else feel miserable as well."]}
