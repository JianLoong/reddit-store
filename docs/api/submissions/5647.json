But you can help and be constructive and if that doesn\u2019t get you anywhere, I think couples counseling would make a lot of sense. \n\nThe crux of your problem is that you have expectations out of your husband that he\u2019s not meeting.

Although really, there's nowhere near enough info for you, me, or the best experts to diagnose him in this forum.

You should be happy.\" If they had called first to ask if they could come down, you would have told them \"no\" and saved them the trouble.\n\n\"My 12 year old is pretty upset about this too and said she wanted them to stay.\" Completely understandable. If your parents had called to discuss their idea before showing up unexpectedly, maybe you could have worked something out, such as them staying in a nearby hotel and you bringing your daughter to the hotel after your son went to bed.
