I didn\u2019t tell you to shut up, I called you out for being manipulative. How is that telling you that you can\u2019t have an opinion?", "Op said she did additional things with the other children after the son was taken care of. She said nothing to indicate that whatever his medical condition is will be chronic. She\u2019s doing her best.", "This. It was a purposeful breach of boundaries.", "They were just trying to help.", "Nah... I was simply pointing out that we should appreciate our parents whilst we have them. My parents lived to ripe old age. No trauma. But yeah...i certainly DID realise how old they were and knew they'd die...but I'd still give anything to have another day with them. \n\nThey were 85 & 97 when they died. Have to be grateful for that.", "And that changes my response how?", "Appreciating your parents doesn't mean not setting boundaries. Also your loss doesn't have anything to do with this situation, don't use your parents as a tool to convince OP they're wrong.", "Why change your response? You have your opinion and i have mine. Relax!", "Pl-ease. Get a grip.\n\nBut yeah. Rudely kicking your own parents out of your house on Christmas day? Is not something i would ever do.\nIf my 14 year old is having a panic attack because his grandparents are there? Id be taking him back to the hospital because unless he hates his grandparents? Or the family doesn't get on with grandparents or there is some other major issue? Then that is utterly bizzare and he needs to be with professionals", "Were they really trying to help, though? They showed up unannounced and made themselves at home, despite being told explicitly that the son couldn\u2019t be around people. It sounds more like they disregarded and disrespected their daughter.", "I'm not changing my response, you'd already said exactly those words in the comment I originally reasoned to so I was confused as to how repeating the statement I'd originally disagreed with changed anything. Why are you telling me to relax because I asked for clarification about your repetition?", "Hit a nerve, did I? Too bad.", "They trespassed. Waltzed in to her home uninvited. No one has the right to do that just because they\u2019re parents. You would be calling the cops if anyone else did that."]}
