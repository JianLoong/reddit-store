It's pretty much just enough room for my bed, dresser, and desk (I work from home). Not only is it tight for two people in the room together, but there is already no room for more stuff. They suggested that we move my desk into the available room and that becomes my office, and we share my room. The problem with that is now I'm paying for two rooms. They offered to pay half my rooms rent but can't afford to pay a whole room. So my rent would go up 1.5x, not double.\n\nI _can_ afford to do this. But then I wouldn't be saving any money towards possible home ownership in the future (I know, a pipe dream).\n\nThey are upset that I'm not into sharing the room.

Considering the fact that your partner would probably end up sleeping in your bed every night, it probably makes sense that you don't need a partner a, partner b room, but having the second room for your office, clothes storage etc is a good idea. Your partner does need to pay half however. If they can't pay for a single room, what else are they going to expect you to pay for. Unless their income is massively less than yours and you were combining finances, this is a red flag.", "NTA- why would you give UP some of your living space / privacy to pay more for someone to live with you (and they pay less than you are paying)? It makes no sense.", "NTA, but if your partner can\u2019t afford to pay the rent on just a bedroom I\u2019d expect more issues like this to pop up in the future.", "NTA, no way! Why should you have to make sacrifices to live with them, but they don't have to? It is absolutely normal to pay for your own residence. How are they justifying the desire to be cheap while costing you 1.5x your housing costs? (edit - removed gender)", "NTA \n\nThey can stay where they are at. You enjoy saving money!", "NTA It doesn't look like they're in a position to move in with you. If you two really do want to move in together, I suggest looking at alternative housing options", "INFO: If they move into your room, and you move your office to the extra room, why can't they still pay a full room's rent? Why should you have to up what you pay, because they want to share? *If* you did share, they should still pay a whole room's rent. Because if you *don't* share, you *don't* have to use the extra room as an office. Honestly, NTA.", "Tell them either pays for a whole room for themselves or you will have to find someone else to take it over and they doesn\u2019t get to move in with you. Give them those two options do not let them talk you into this arrangement where they gets a better deal which leaves you out of pocket.", "NTA\n\nIf you guys take two rooms, you pay half no matter the arrangements.", "NTA\n\nIn my experience it's rare for any relationship to work when one partner has to \"make sacrifices\". \n\nSuccessful relationships must be beneficial to *both* people. Or at the very least, not detrimental.", "NTA. Is your partner wanting to cut spending by living with you? It certainly looks that way. Start as you mean to go on.", "NTA, common situation, but two people, two rooms, is healthy.  Even if you take the biggest and smallest rooms between you (to be fair to the other housemates) you pay for two rooms for two people.  That's you each pay for a room each, no matter what your sleeping arrangements.", "If he\u2019s going to move in and wants to have you use the second room as an office (rather than have it for himself) he should still be paying for it. It sounds like it\u2019s super beneficial for him to move in with you and inky pay for half a room. But why are you going to have to pay for 1.5 rooms??? Why is him moving in costing you more money????\n\nNTA\n\nThis sounds like he\u2019s being a mooch. \n\nHe should be paying for the second room. And if you two need more space (since your room is tight) then the second room could be used as your office/extra space for his stuff. \n\nSo you both sleep in room 1, and you both share room 2 as an office/closet.", "NTA", "NTA.  We all need some area where we can be ourselves, by ourselves.  Not only not having your own place, but sharing a room, personally sounds claustrophobic.  You\u2019re not an asshole or an unloving partner for putting your sanity first.\n\nFurthermore, you\u2019re not an asshole for not agreeing to THEIR idea where YOU pay 1.5x as much rent.  It\u2019s a little tacky even suggesting this, and it\u2019s downright assholish being upset with you for saying no.  That\u2019s grounds for being called a mooch.\n\n(Edited to my reunderstanding of the math)", "NTA. It\u2019s not fair that your rent would increase and they\u2019d only pay for half a room.", "NTA\n\nIf your partner isn't willing to pay the full amount of the increased costs you would incur for their moving in with you, they aren't much of a partner.", "If your partner cannot negotiate a comfortable situation for the both of you, the relationship is doomed.

You wouldn't need the extra room if they weren't moving in so the fact that it would need to be your office doesn't matter when deciding how to split rent.  If they don't move in you need 1, if they do move in then you guys needs 2. They are just as responsible for creating a need for that room as you are.  If they can't help offset the increased cost of moving in and needing more space (and/or don't understand what \"partner\" means) then maybe it's not the right time for them to move in.", "NTA, your partner needs to be more fair about this. They are being unreasonable and selfish. Glad you can see it. Rescind the offer, they are no longer welcome to move in", "NTA. What sacrifices would *they* be making in this scenario? Or are you just expected to pay extra to subsidize their living situation? If you do end up sharing one bedroom and renting the other room out for an office and extra storage, it\u2019s only fair that you split it 50/50 because they\u2019re the only reason you need a whole second room.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

My recommendation is to look at both of your \u201ctake-home\u201d pay after loans, cars, etc. are paid for and use that to determine which percentage you each should pay split across the two rooms. Then you are paying the same percentage-wise of your net income and it is entirely fair. \n\nIf they can\u2019t afford that compromise, they can\u2019t afford to move out and it sucks but it is what it is.", "I went to college and have a good job, they did not.

Just curious, and completely unrelated, but what made you assume my partner was male? I often find the language of \"partner\" makes people think it's a gay relationship. I'm not mad at all just something that interests me that I'd like to explore :)", "They can't afford a whole room. They currently still live with their dad (late 20s) at a reduced rent compared to the area.", "Can I ask what made you think my partner is a male? I'm not mad or anything more just curious. It seems the word partner makes people assume it's a gay relationship. Is that the case?", "That's a great point. I do think there would be a huge benefit to them moving in around the food I eat. I'm not really a cook and do takeout a lot. They are a great cook and love to do it. I would probably save some money on food and be eating better, but I don't think that savings would offset the extra rent.", "No, they currently live with their dad so moving out would obviously be more expensive", "Thanks for the response! Just curious, why did you think my partner is male? I'm not upset or trying to start some gender dialogue. It just seems a few comments made this assumption and I'm curious why. Does partner imply a gay relationship? Or did you think I was female? Again - not mad or anything just trying to understand :)", "No they are paying half of 1 room.

No they don't live with me that's the whole point of the post - moving in together.", "I agree. And im totally down with the suggestion of having a bedroom and an office, but we should still both pay the same amount", "Be careful they are not using you to fund their lifestyle under the guise of love.

Being in your room or another is irrelevant.", "Sorry. I think it's because I've just read a series of posts with male \"offenders\" and was being lazy. I don't think there is anything in your post that specifically triggered \"male\" for me. Partner is neutral.", "You didn\u2019t clarify your gender either? The gender assumption has to do with the fact that guys (seemingly) tend to act like this more often\u2014 not the word partner.", "Do they have any plans to increase their income to be able to afford to move out?", "Then partner can stay home with dad. When partner gets a better job, then consider sharing an apartment.", "You did not include your gender.", "Sorry changed to not reflect any particular gender.", "Only here to offer advice on whether I think it\u2019s fair for your partner to expect you to pay for 1.5 rooms.

OP doesn't need an extra office space if the partner doesn't move in, they are fine in their current setup. Partner moving in requires an extra room: rent is split in half! Easy!", "It sounds like your partner wants to live beyond their means and expects you to foot the bill. This entitlement is likely to appear in other ways of your relationship. \n\nYour partner lives with their dad. How much does their dad subsidize your partner's lifestyle? Food, utilities, luxuries? I worry your partner expect you to be their ATM, especially if dad's undercharging them. If they move in, the next step will likely be \"I don't have money to pay for water, oh well OP can cover me\".\n\nI consider this a red flag, honestly. They already showed how they expect you to make sacrifices without giving anything in return."]}
