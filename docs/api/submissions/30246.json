I texted that my dad was very clear about what his money was for, and they wouldn't be allowed access to it.  After more angry calls I decided to block them. A few days later while I was showering they came through my back yard and got in my house and started screaming at me in the bathroom.  My kids are terrified and crying and I'm asking them to leave but they won't. Finally I say I'm calling the police and they go, but make sure to kick the walls and doors on the way out.

Her callousness to me and her grandchildren is unacceptable, and I want no further contact with any of them.

She sounds unhinged showing up and yelling at you like that, there's no excusing it, but the crux of the matter remains whether or not you are legally entitled to take the money and run.", "NTA - but remember, your kids aren't losing family, they're losing toxic people from their life.", "NTA", "YWNBTA.  \n\nIf you didn't call the cops when they literally broke in, that was a mistake.  At any rate, walk away, look into whatever sort of protection order you can get on your half sibling and his family.  I doubt you will have any real recourse to get any of that money back.  \n\nIf you really believe your mom is being manipulated, call her and give her one chance to back off if she wants to have any sort of relationship with you and your kids/her grandkids.  If she can't do that, no contact with her as well.  Figure out whatever legal ties you may have with her and shed them (I'm thinking even in terms of  her being an emergency contact, allowed to pick up the kids at school etc etc).  \n\nIts an awful situation you are in.

I do tend to cut people a lot of slack right after their spouse has died. That is a heavy duty trauma. But her behavior, showing up at your house and shouting, is over the top. \n\nCutting her off feels perfectly reasonable. That can be a permanent decision, of course, but if you find out later that she is back on her meds, and you think it would be good for your kids to have her in their life, then you can always change your mind. But for now it sounds like your kids aren't losing much in being cut off from her.", "\\>We have never had a funeral for my dad, and the only time she contacted me after he died was to badmouth him or complain that he didn't leave money to my half sibling\n\nI'm probably being an idiot here, but if it is your half sibling then presumably they aren't your dad's child? Why would he leave money to them?\n\nAnyway, NTA.

Good luck!", "On principle, absolutely NTA. Your mom and half sibling have proven that they are not acting rationally and cannot be trusted with the funds that were in the account.\n\nLegally, if this is a substantial amount, you probably need to see a lawyer. The account belonged to you and your dad and, when he died, your mom inherited his part (that's why she was given access to it) and so it then belonged to you and her.  She obviously took money out without your permission, but you did the same.  You may have legal claims against each other and, depending on the amounts taken, they could be serious.", "NTA", "Lose what family? They disowned you first.

Your children will benefit without the toxic behavior in their lives.", "NTA\n\nWhen someone shows you who they are, believe them.\n\nFamily like that isn\u2019t worth fighting for. Keep the money and move on.", "I really don't know how she got access.  She never told me she was doing anything, but she rarely tells me of her plans.  I never thought it would be an issue seeing as the money was supposed to be for her grand kids.  There was no will, or anything left in writing as his passing was very sudden.  I'm sure my mom and half sibling had heard him say that the money was for the kids education,  but I can see them not admitting that for financial gain.", "This is the right take. Even if OP should have gotten it, legal documents might trump the sentiment.", "This is not legal advice but if this the US then what he did is fine as long as his name was on the account, which it would have to be if the bank actually let him withdraw all the funds.", "Yeah, definitely talk to a lawyer. NTA.", "How much was taken?  That would really be the deciding factor on whether you pursue it legally.  If the legal costs would outweigh the amount that was taken and you're seeking return from your mother, then best to drop it, go NC, and move on.  But, if it's significant, then engage an attorney and take it from there.  Even with the absence of a will, the account was in his and your names only, so you should be the sole owner of the account.  The financial institution is responsible for granting your mother access to it.", "I will be speaking with a lawyer to hopefully clarify things.  I still feel better removing the money now before there's no money left to remove.  Kids won't be going to college for a while so everything should still be there later if the law decides we have to give it back.", "A few thousand,  so it would likely be a wash in the end.  I will contact the bank to see how this happened.  Thanks for the idea.", "As long as it\u2019s not touched and remains as is, then it can be given back if it\u2019s judged to be legally someone else\u2019s.\n\nThis is more of a CYA (cover your a**) moment and to make sure there are no ramifications on you in the future."]}
