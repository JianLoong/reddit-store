He might continue to cheat but the next time, he will hide his partner(s) from you. Great, well done. You missed a chance to have a genuine sit down with him and talk about your concerns, a chance to connect with him and and showing that you care.", "YTA. Yes he was in the wrong and not treating these people respectfully, but this was not a good way to teach him this lesson. In time, I guarantee this drama would have all unraveled on its own anyway, and in my opinion you should have just let it run its course and left him to face the social consequences naturally.

Heck you could of called either of them and told them yourself. Calling the gf over was just a bit too much.", "For me it's a soft YTA. He played stupid games, and won stupid prizes.

He's TA for what he did, now you need to own your AH title as well.", "YTA. Not your place at all. Regardless of whether he admits it or not, growing up non heterosexual is fucking hard and he may be trying to figure shit out and you\u2019ve now traumatised the kid.

What parent just invites their sons friends over?", "YTA , with the information I have right now. While I agree with not supporting him cheating the fact that you said \" I thought watching all his lies blow up was quite amusing\" is pretty shit. You're his mother and getting amusement out of destroying his relationships is not really a great thing to say. \n\nI know a lot of people are saying like he's 17 he's old enough etc. I understand 3 months is a long time but at the same time maybe genuinely he was just trying to figure things out in his head. Relationships are hard enough at 17 and figuring them out nevermind throwing in figuring out sexuality or what you might prefer. \n\nI'm not trying to defend the kid here though, cheating is wrong and he should have been upfront with his bf and been honest about it all. Perhaps even ask if he'd be okay to figure things out and see how he feels. \n\nWhile he may have been cheating, which again, very wrong, if you'd perhaps gave him an ultimatum before doing this, maybe he might have been able to go through this situation and kept both of these people in his life.

If he\u2019s 17 now I doubt this is the first time she\u2019s done something like this to humiliate and punish him.", "Not just feeling but lives. That is someone\u2019s life they could really hurt them self due to all of that. Better to find out early before it\u2019s years", "Your son is a cheater, enough said. You are a sadistic interfering AH.\n\nYou had no regard for your son's girlfriend or boyfriend feelings when \"teaching\" your son a lesson. You should be more direct with your life lessons and authority.", "Seriously my biggest beef with polyamory is just all the jerks misusing the label to justify cheating. \n\nTons of ethical non monogamous folks out there. But it\u2019s unfortunately one of the top sheep fashions for the wolves.", "Polyamory? He\u2019s 17. They\u2019re just kids. He was being selfish it\u2019s as simple as that.", "[deleted]", "Also, once a cheater, always a cheater. So maybe, just maybe, this may be what he needed to break that before he created a full cycle for himself and just might prevent him from doing it again.", "What does DL stand for in this context?", "Women who are HIV+ predominantly acquire the infection from bisexual men. It's serious stuff to not be honest. Let her decide if she wants to be on prEp or what but she needs to know", "Exactly\u2026 there MUST have been a way to intervene without setting up a show in the living room.", "Then OP should be an actual parent and *punish* him individually, in his own house. No cell phone, no having guests over or something. \n\nDon\u2019t set up teenagers to get their feelings hurt. OP is way too invested in this tbh.", "Yes, and when they inevitably found out of their own accord, he would have been burned and suffered the consequences.\n\nIt's honestly none of his parents business whatsoever who he is dating.", "I would disagree, morals evolve. (If I remember what my philosophy teacher taught me)", "So just let the STDs spread...", "\u201cI thought watching his lies blow up was quite amusing\u201d.\n\nI agree that stepping in was right, but the way he went about it was awful", "You\u2019re right, they didn\u2019t deserve a cheater. OP gave them a very direct way of explaining they are dating a cheater. Telling them would not have done that and given his son time to continue to manipulate the situation", "What a ridiculous over-exaggeration. They weren't in a crowded restaurant filled with friends and acquaintances, they were in a private home, and the only witnesses were OP and maybe their spouse.", "Public? It was the definition of a private setting?", "It's a valid concern. Bi and homosexual men have a higher rate of contracting STDs like syphilis, gonorrhea and HIV. Considering the fact that they're also teen boys with no risk of pregnancy they probably aren't using protection either. So it's more likely that they'll spread something to the girl than vice versa", "Even without violence OP did invite the girlfriend knowing she would end up humiliated and gave her no warning about the situation, as well as the boyfriend. OP didn\u2019t limit to themselves to expose the son, which would have been absolutely justified, but went further to create drama.", "He could have told them both without being an AH and making a drama out of it for his enjoyment. He apparently has their numbers. Idk how you can defend OPs behaviour in this situation.", "So the innocent parties deserved to continue to be deceived and their time wasted until the kid decided 6 months, a year to grow a conscious?", "\"But it\u2019s unfortunately one of the top sheep fashions for the wolves.\"\n\nOmg I've never heard this saying phrased quite like that so cool \ud83d\ude0e", "\"top sheep fashion for the wolves\" is brilliant phrasing, omg. I wish I had an award to give.", " You're the justified asshole", "You're the justified asshole\n\nHe gets what he deserves, quite frankly.", "Bot", "Lol that\u2019s not true", "Bot", "\u201cDown Low\u201d meaning having sex with men, but remaining closeted.", "Down Low, or on the Down Low.", "Down low, secret", "Is there a source for this stat?", "Biphobic myth.", "Endangering the emotional, mental and physical health of two other people isn\u2019t a \u201cno cell phone\u201d kind of thing. \n\nHe had 3 months to do the right thing.", "Then don't bring that kind of business home.\n\nWould they have found out? Maybe. Who knows. Could he have potentially given the other something cause he's such a sleaze? Definitely.", "He\u2019s not 18 yet, it is their business", "Nah cheaters deserve to get outed in the most embarrassing ways. OP is NTA.", "He was warned and given a chance to come clean he failed to do so.  This is a life lesson, people aren't you're playthings to use physically and emotionally.", "Yup. She's a 16 years old, OP could have handled it with more tact, gee ... This is definitely going to affect her future relationships. Hell, this might even be her first relationship too.", "?

If I was the other kids parents I would be pissed.", "But the OP traumatized the girlfriend and the boyfriend. If it were only the son that was harmed, that would be one thing. But this makes you a major asshole.", "Probably replied to you by mistake. (Intended for OP)", "That's from 2002, it's sample population is from New York and they don't even make the claim that women predominantly contract HIV from Bisexual men.", "Did you read the entire source before you sent that link? Because it states in the limitations section that their data \"cannot directly support the sexual network analysis needed to establish bisexual men as a bridge population\" and \"the HTIS sample of bisexual men who engaged in high risk sexual activity with men and women  was too small to adequately characterize.\" This study is also 20 years old at this point.\n\nThe idea that bisexual men commonly spread HIV to straight women is a horrible biphobic stereotype that needs to die.", ">But the OP traumatized the girlfriend and the boyfriend.\n\nActually OP's son did that with the lies...", "[deleted]", "Reddit either forgot or intentionally censors evidence of the aids epidemic.", "You are spreading dangerous misinformation. Unprotected anal sex is a very common and dangerous practice among gay and bisexual men. I\u2019ve never heard of women being big catchers. A women who has a sexual fetish to be infected by hiv. But it sure is a thing in the gay community. To say that bisexual men aren\u2019t more at risk for hiv is simply putting your head in the sand.", "True, but the OP should not have set that all up. Perhaps the OP should've banned the son from having any guests come over?", "In terms of HIV prevention, yes! Of course it has! But thanks for the getting the opportunity to spread misinformation about bisexual men, I really appreciate that one."]}
