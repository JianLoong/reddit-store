I am an only child and she wants me to hyphenate my last name and his instead. I haven\u2019t thought much about the comments because they are so few and far between, until fianc\u00e9 and I flew to visit them for the past weekend. While staying with them, my mom brought it up again with my dad and I in the room while my fianc\u00e9 was upstairs. She again expressed her wants for me to hyphenate, but I told her I feel that would be too long of a name and too complicated (it would be First Middle Last-Last). She said nobody would say the first last name anyway. But they already gave me a first name that is never pronounced correctly (even by people in my family), because it is a common name just spelled unusually. So I want to make things easier for myself and honestly my fianc\u00e9\u2019s last name is much more aesthetically appealing (but i didn\u2019t say that part). I told her I am considering making my maiden name my middle name and losing the one I have now, or just replace my last name with his. She hated the middle name idea because the one she gave me is also hers, so I would be \u201closing a part of her\u201d. But, I\u2019ve never been attached to this name because it is also a common name but spelled different (Renee spelled Rena). I said I\u2019m tired of people constantly saying my name wrong. But she went on that losing either my middle or last name would \u201cbreak my father\u2019s heart\u201d (while my dad stood there silently) and guilt tripped me. I couldn\u2019t make the point that she took my dad\u2019s last name when they married, because her maiden name wasn\u2019t actually her biological father\u2019s so she didn\u2019t feel attached to it. I eventually left the room when the discussion was clearly feeling \u201cmy way or no way\u201d.\n\nAfter coming back downstairs later with my fianc\u00e9, mom asked him if I told him about our discussion and he replied, \u201cabout making her name long?\u201d To which she said \u201cSo you\u2019re going to take our name right?\u201d which got her a quick \u201chahah no.\u201d and after a pause he explained he likes his last name and is the only son to carry it. After this, she let it go and we all left to go shopping like planned but my mother gave us the silent treatment the entire trip and car ride until the return home. \n\nAITA for \u201csymbolically crushing my dads heart\u201d?

In the early 70s I was in the Navy and worked in the personnel office. I was stationed in Okinawa Japan at the time. We had a young, female Ensign (most junior Navy officer) -- who probably should have never been in the Navy  --  in charge of our office. We had a young sailor transfer into our Command who brought along his newly married wife. As I was checking him in and taking care of the paperwork, along with creating an ID card for her, she notified me that she was keeping her maiden name. I didn't care one way or the other so I said sure, okay with me. I did up the paperwork and sent it off for the Ensign to sign. Well, she had a real fit. She came out of her office with an \"How dare you not take your husband's last name\" attitude. The sailor was a junior enlisted person who could not talk back to the Ensign, but that certainly did not apply to his wife. She stared down the Ensign, and told her that there was nothing in Massachusetts law that required her to take her husband's name, she respected her father too much to change from his name, and she had her Master's degree in chemical engineering and wasn't going to let some jumped up Navy officer tell her what she could or could not do. I was just sitting there behind my desk, enjoying the whole show. The panicked look on the Ensign's face was a delight to behold. The vast majority of the young wives in that position, married to such a junior enlisted person, were pretty much just out of high school themselves, and fairly meek and mild in such an stressful situation. It wound up going back to the Bureau of Naval Personnel in the United States for a final disposition. As a note, it was the Bureau of NAVAL personnel not \"civilian\" personnel. They sent back a response that it wasn't up to them what she did or didn't do with her last name, and that was pretty much the end of the story except for the massive amount of credibility that the Ensign lost with all of us in the office.", "NTA", "NTA   I've been the mother of the bride for 3 daughters. Never once did I say what name they should use. Heck my daughters were gifts to me not by birth and since I got them all right around 13-14 I didn't even name them.  If you're old enough to marry you're certainly old enough to choose your last name, middle name, first name or heck tell them you're going to go by Fred Catfish Laredo from now on. Give them something to truly worry about.    \n\n\nHere's something to think about concerning hyphened names.  I have a dear friend who had the last name   Smith-Carter  and she married a guy named  Hunnington-Smith.   In order to keep both mothers happy when they married they each kept their own last names.  But when they got pregnant the mothers went on rampage & to keep peace that poor little girl was going to be named Jennifer Estelle Esther Smith-Carter-Hunnington-Smith.  And then the highly intrusive & obnoxious godmother (ME) said \"OMG this child is going to absolutely be tortured at school & she will grow up to hate you both, run off with some unemployed tissue paper artist & live in a 1967 Volkswagon van down by the river. Just grow a pair, both of you & tell your mothers NO\"     \n\n\nThat lovely girl who is named Jennifer Maggie Hunnington & just passed the Texas bar.

If you\u2019re going to ignore that then you are really getting into this marriage without enough information. Neither your fianc\u00e9 nor your parents have any right to tell YOU what you need to be called. You are allowed to change your name for any reason that pleases you. But you definitely need to get into it deeper with your fianc\u00e9 before you get married. Does he expect you to take his name or would he be ok if you kept yours? And if not, why is it ok for him to keep his name as he\u2019s the only son and not you when you\u2019re the only daughter? Does he believe that a woman\u2019s last name doesn\u2019t matter as much?

(California)  \nOn my SSN card it looked funny though, because they removed the space in the middle name, but whatever.", "I had a hyphenated name that was super long and I hated it . I actually got divorced and decided to take off my old original name and keep my married last name as it was more interesting. no one knows how annoying it is to have a last name so long it doesn\u2019t fit on paperwork because the columns aren\u2019t long enough.", "NTA. The decision of course is yours.\n\nWhen I got married many years ago I did something that you mentioned. I dropped my middle name (which I never liked anyway), & my maiden name became my middle name. So I am now FirstName MaidenName HusbandsLastName. (Not hyphenated.) It has worked out perfectly for me.
