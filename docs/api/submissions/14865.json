Obviously we also live with our parents. We have 2 older brothers that are moved out already.\n\nSo this all started when my brothers friend (M18, we will call him Alex) parents were divorcing. Because they were fighting all the time my brother asked my parents if he could stay with us. They said yes and that he could stay for as long as needed.\n\nThis is where the issues start. I wear a sports bra and bagging sweatpants to bed usually. It was a Sunday night and I had cleaned my room that weekend. So, I brought my dishes from my snack downstairs to wash up before I went to bed so my room remained clean. I didn\u2019t put on a shirt or anything because the only ones up were my brother and Alex and they were sleeping soon. I hear my brothers door open and he comes down to get some water as I\u2019m on my way back to my room. We say goodnight to each other and keep walking. When I get to my room, Alex is sitting on my bed and he says \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for you. I dreamed about you in that bra last night.\u201d I immediately go back downstairs and tell my brother what happened. He lets me stay in his room that night with him and tells Alex that he needs to stop being creepy.\n\nMe and my brother share a bathroom so the next night while I\u2019m showering, he knocks to see if I\u2019m almost done. I realize I\u2019ve been in awhile and tell him I\u2019ll get him when I\u2019m done. I dry off and the bathroom is connected to my room so I just go right in. As I\u2019m getting dress Alex opens the door without knocking. He stands there and watched me scramble to cover myself before I scream at him to \u201cget the fuck out of my space\u201d before slamming the door.\n\nI told my parents the next morning that if Alex doesn\u2019t leave then I\u2019m going to go live with my aunt. They said I\u2019m being dramatic and rude to Alex and that he didn\u2019t mean to do any of that stuff. This pissed me off.\n\nSo people of reddit, WIBTA if i moved to my Aunts house if Alex didn\u2019t leave?", "created_utc": 1681572226, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12n7ami/wibta_if_i_left_my_parents_house_because_they/", "score": 104, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What he is doing is beyond being creepy and he knows what he is doing. No 18-year-old in their right mind would look at a 15-year-old that way. If your parents won't see reason, move.

You're not rude at all. Move in with your aunt immediately if your parents and your brother are not listening to you. Always trust your instinct - if you feel threatened by Alex, there's a reason your body and mind are reacting that way. Call your aunt, tell her what's happened, and get her to come pick you up immediately. And tell your teacher or counsellor at school as well. You need to be safe, and that comes first.", "YWNBTA  \nWhat is wrong with your parents? Are they waiting for him to physically assault you or would you be accused of being dramatic then also? I hope you go live with your aunt and do it soon. You're not safe in your parent's house.", "NTA. If i were in your parents shoes the kid would already be sleeping on a sidewalk.

Yes, that little tosser is sexually harassing you in your own home. \n\nSince you parents aren\u2019t prepared to protect you in this matter and because Alex will undoubtedly pick up on this - especially as your brother has already had a conversation with him to no avail, I suggest a conversation with this aunt you mention. Do not wait for a third occurrence. Alex is escalating. Physical contact will be next. \n\nAunt may be able to make your parents see some sense. But if they won\u2019t hear her, I think moving in with her would be good. You are *always* within your rights to protect yourself from harm. Indeed, I commend you for having the maturity to recognise this for what it is. Which again, is sexual harassment.
