We have a designated smoking area outside and I avoid it.  \n\nRecently there has been a problem at my job with employees taking excessive smoking breaks. It's really one employee in particular, Judy, who takes roughly 12 smoke breaks during the day, plus her lunch. Managers got annoyed when they couldn't find her and multiple times she was found outside smoking.  \n\nSo they changed the policy, employees were limited to two smoke breaks a day. You have the option of giving up your lunch break to take two additional smoke breaks. Cameras were installed in the smoking area to record when employees went out. In addition, we have to use our badge to open the door every time we go in or out of the building. This is recorded in an audit log.  \n\nOn a typical day, I badge in upon arrival, badge out for lunch, badge in to come back, and badge out to go home.  \n\nThe only door that is not badge activated is the fire door. It's close to my desk. The fire door can only be opened from the inside. The outside doesn't have a handle. There is no camera in this area.  \n\nJudy has recently taken to propping the fire door open, going right outside and having a cigarette. This wafts back into the office and stinks up the entire area. Judy works in another department so I don't see her that often and have to smell her disgusting smoke, but this has really started to be a problem.  \n\nI asked her to please not prop the door open because the smoke is coming in. She told me to mind my own business.  \n\nSo when she went out for a cigarette break, I pulled out her makeshift doorstop and closed the door, preventing the smoke from coming in and locking her out. She had to badge back into the front door and didn't say anything. An hour later she came back and did the same thing, so I once again closed the fire door and locked her out. This time she came storming back in and screamed that whatever idiot kept playing with the doorstop needed to stop touching things that don't belong to them.  \n\nI heard that Judy was recently written up because her badges in didn't match her badges out and they have told her that if she keeps taking unauthorized breaks, her pay will be docked.  \n\nOne of my coworkers told me I need to just let it go and stop getting her in trouble.

Though if you told any higher ups about her using the fire door wouldn't they just fire her and solve the problem for you?  \n\nAs a smoker myself, 2 breaks and a lunch is generous.  12 is just wanting to get paid for not working.", "NTA fuck that shit. If you can smell cigarettes that means you're breathing it in. Take the door stop out every goddamn time as far as I'm concerned. She's can find a different way to cheat that doesn't involve your health", "NTA.\nThere's a no smoking policy for a reason. She's TA for fudging rules.", "NTA. Most likely propping the fire door open is against the law, plus she is being inconsiderate letting her smoke blow back into the office. And then there\u2019s the time theft. It always bothered me when coworkers would go outside to smoke for 10 minutes every hour. That\u2019s an hour and 20 minutes of lost time every single day, not even including lunch and two regular 15 minute breaks.", "NTA. Keep doing it. She\u2019ll learn.", "NTA. You asked nicely, she was awful, even though she was the one breaking rules, being not only inconsiderate, but flat-out putting your health at risk, for her disgusting addiction. In fact, what she is doing is time theft and she should be fired. She shouldn't be given an exception because her addiction is out of control and she's incredibly selfish.", "nta. I don't know why smokers get special treatment. There should be no 'free' smoke breaks. Just your lunch and the 2 required 15 min breaks (at least in my state). Otherwise those free breaks should just be called 2 extra free breaks, why just smokers?", "NTA You have every right to protect your health. That is most definitely your business. The fact that she can't follow the rules is not your fault. Let your boss know your getting flack for keeping your area smoke free.", "NTA. You've got a medical problem and trying to save yourself from smoke. If anyone is getting reprimand for something they're doing it's their responsibility.", "NTA - a little passive aggressive, but she's clearly in the wrong. I'd probably tell her you're the one doing it (and why) and give her the chance to course-correct, but it sounds like she wouldn't be receptive anyways.", "NTA. Building security doesn't want fire doors propped open, the badge system and limited access exists for a reason. I don't like your reasoning for doing it, but it's irrelevant, because the act itself isn't wrong. \n\nI'm kind of surprised Judy is getting a second chance, she would not at most companies.", "NTA, good for you. That door is a safety issue and the smoke is making you sick. If Judy was a good employee pulling her weight, I wouldn't care if she took a dozen smoke breaks but it does not sound like the case", "NTA. Judy is digging her own grave by not following company policies and propping open the door, which is a security issue for an access-controlled workplace. I'm not sure what your company makes or does, but random open doors are not acceptable in most workplaces since they are protecting valuable goods, trade secrets, and/or trying to prevent workplace violence. Not to mention, smoke is a health hazard to you. I also think you need to report this to your manager, not just keep locking her out.", "Nta. You shouldn\u2019t have to breathe someone\u2019s secondhand smoke at work, unless you work somewhere smoking is allowed.", "NTA I can\u2019t believe this is even in question. Your coworker is extremely inconsiderate and good for you for finding a solution!", "NTA but you really should have some sort of manager involved. If she is ducking out like that to avoid badging and cameras then management should be made aware.", "NTA. They are very incosiderate.", "Tee Hee, I love this solution! Good for you. A definite and hearty NTA!", "I'd put up a sign saying. \n\nIf you jeep getting locked out for smoking instead of working, maybe you should take a hint and do it when and where you're supposed to.  \n\nAgain, time theft is still theft.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You're opening yourself up to a world of trouble by \"dealing\" with it yourself.  The next time you see it happening, inform a manager so they can remove the doorstop.  That way if Judy tries to get back at you, management will know why.", "NTA\n\nIf your building is controlled access, I would let a superior know that someone (you don't have to say who) is propping open the fire exit. You can go a few routes here: you can say it appears to be for smoking breaks, as you can smell it and this is dangerous for your health concerns. Or you can raise it as more of a security concern (\"is there a policy change I should be aware of?\") It all depends on how likely it is that someone will know it was you. I would try to avoid snitching outright, because office politics, but letting management know that the fire exit is an issue isn't a bad idea.\n\nAlso, fire exits are often tied to alarms. My other concern would be if the door is supposed to be alarmed but isn't.\n\nThe purpose behind this is that it will likely cause management to keep a closer eye on the door--especially if they know someone's access logs aren't matching up.", "As a a smoker, 100% NTA.", "ESH. what she's doing is shitty, but it's super duper not okay to be locking someone out of a fire exit. \n\nInstead of being passive aggressive, report her.

This is the kind of problem that solves itself", "I wouldn't tell her, who knows what she might do to her car and whatever. She's had a chance and just kept doing it.", "Really? so she should be subjected to that person's smoke? The smoker wouldn't be locked out if they went out the regular door. The fire door shouldn't be propped open.

She isnt in danger of being trapped if there is a fire. She is locked OUT of the building, not in.", "Fuck that. I would take that door stop out every time if it's my health that's being directly effected.", "OP isn't \"locking someone out of a fire exit\".  That exit is meant for people *leaving* the building.  People can still leave.  People can always leave a building via an emergency fire exit.  What people *can't* do is get back inside a building from that same fire exit.  It's not meant as an entrance to the building since it doesn't even have a handle, for goodness sake.\n\nJudy is causing a security issue by propping that door open.  All OP is doing is correcting the security issue.", "I never ONCE said she should have to be subjected to it. I said she should REPORT IT. Read my comment properly.
