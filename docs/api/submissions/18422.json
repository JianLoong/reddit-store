However, after the shower was done I received texts from my mom and sister asking when we had decided what to name our baby. I told them that we hadn\u2019t decided. They then asked why a giant banner was unravelled with the words BAMBI PLUM written on it in a grand name reveal, all without my knowledge. Sure enough, I check my wife\u2019s instagram, and there\u2019s a photo of her posing in front of this banner with the caption BAMBI PLUM \ud83d\udc96.\n\nNaturally, I confronted my wife about this and she flew into a rage.

I felt like I was in a losing battle at this point, and reluctantly agreed to call the baby Bambi Plum in order to get her to calm down. Our relationship seemed to improve immensely after this, and we were on the same page again. \n\nHowever, four days ago, our baby was born. My wife had to be rushed into an emergency C-Section, but is recovering well. Our daughter is healthy, and wonderful, and amazing. But I couldn\u2019t do it- I couldn\u2019t let her be named Bambi Plum.\n\nWhen the nurse came over to fill in the birth certificate, my wife was still pretty out of it due to all the pain relief medication she was on. She could barely answer any questions without giggling or doing a weird face, and was not really \u201cwith it.\u201d So when the nurse asked what we wanted to name the baby, I quietly said \u201cRenee Plum,\u201d instead of Bambi Plum (Renee is my wife\u2019s middle name, and she seems to like it well enough).\n\nWhen my wife found out, she had a massive meltdown.

Your wife is being selfish and immature by trying to use your child for a chance at making it as an influencer (not that I think it would\u2019ve even done anything more than maybe get her a headline so people can laugh at the name). That being said there must\u2019ve been a better way to deal with this in the ~9 months she was pregnant; otherwise you guys seem to not be on the same page and have a communication issue.
