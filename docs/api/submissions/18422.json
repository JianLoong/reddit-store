We have been trying for the last four years with a couple of fertility road bumps, so naturally we were both thrilled to learn that we would soon be parents. But we couldn\u2019t (and still can\u2019t) agree on what our daughter\u2019s name should be, or even what it is appropriate to name a human being.\n\nMy wife really likes wackadoodle, crazy names that just wouldn\u2019t fit an adult human being. I told her that I was willing to compromise with something unusual or unique (but still a real name), or a normal name with an unconventional middle name, but my wife said she didn\u2019t want our daughter to be \u201cbasic like all the other girls.\u201d\n\nWe still hadn\u2019t decided on a name by the time my wife had her baby shower. However, after the shower was done I received texts from my mom and sister asking when we had decided what to name our baby. I told them that we hadn\u2019t decided. They then asked why a giant banner was unravelled with the words BAMBI PLUM written on it in a grand name reveal, all without my knowledge. Sure enough, I check my wife\u2019s instagram, and there\u2019s a photo of her posing in front of this banner with the caption BAMBI PLUM \ud83d\udc96.\n\nNaturally, I confronted my wife about this and she flew into a rage. She claimed that I was ruining her influencer career and her brand by trying to suggest more conventional names, and that it would be embarrassing to change the baby\u2019s name now because \u201cBambi Plum\u201d had been announced to all her friends, family and followers (CONTEXT: my wife has been trying for the last couple years to become an influencer, but has not amassed a substantial following). I felt like I was in a losing battle at this point, and reluctantly agreed to call the baby Bambi Plum in order to get her to calm down. Our relationship seemed to improve immensely after this, and we were on the same page again.\n\nHowever, four days ago, our baby was born. My wife had to be rushed into an emergency C-Section, but is recovering well. Our daughter is healthy, and wonderful, and amazing. But I couldn\u2019t do it- I couldn\u2019t let her be named Bambi Plum.\n\nWhen the nurse came over to fill in the birth certificate, my wife was still pretty out of it due to all the pain relief medication she was on. She could barely answer any questions without giggling or doing a weird face, and was not really \u201cwith it.\u201d So when the nurse asked what we wanted to name the baby, I quietly said \u201cRenee Plum,\u201d instead of Bambi Plum (Renee is my wife\u2019s middle name, and she seems to like it well enough).\n\nWhen my wife found out, she had a massive meltdown. For the last couple of days I have been bombarded with text messages from her friends calling me abusive and toxic. But I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019ve done anything wrong. AITA?\n\nEDIT:\n\n\\-Some people have asked why I gave in to the name Bambi Plum in the first place. The reason why is that my wife has been in anger management therapy in the past as she will sometimes break things, has threatened to hurt herself and leaves long scratches on her arms with her nails when she gets too upset. I was scared she might hurt herself if the issue continued.\n\n\\-I had serious qualms about the name, but when the nurse asked us for it I realised that I actually physically could not say Bambi Plum. \"Renee Plum,\" is the first thing that came to mind, so I just went with that. I didn't mean to betray my wife's trust.\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1685327488, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13uifcm/aita_for_writing_a_different_name_on_my_daughters/", "score": 1540, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My uncle grew up thinking his name was what he's always been called (grandfather's name choice). \n\nNow because my uncle's and mom were born to horrible parents, they actually kind of raised themselves in the streets.

Their grandma lived in a TINY village, actually I don't even think it's large enough to be considered a village, in Illinois. Everyone knew everyone. The school never recorded birth certificates on any of the kids. Not quite sure if that was legal then, but their granny was the headmistress of the school. (Singular, one school for all ages).  Every human in that place knew, who every kid belonged to. Their aunt was the postmaster general. Their uncle was sheriff.  (Think Mayberry, Andy Griffith Show. Then cut half the population and replace it with corn, and replace another quarter with cows.)\n\nNow keep in mind grandma never told ANYONE, including granny my uncle's actual name. He was always known by this other name. So that's how he didn't learn through other methods like, the school calling him by a legal name, or the doctor, or whatever.\n\nThis is how my uncle never found out, until he went to get a driver's license and had to find his birth certificate, that he didn't even know his own name.

Figure out through photos, or simply a person sharing TMI what school kid goes to. Goes to the school at dismissal, sees kid, hey *kids name*, I'm a friend of your mom *mom's name* she sent me to get you. Yeah, some kids are too smart for it, or have a plan/password in place for pick ups by people other than a certain list..  but not all kids do, or they would doubt and weaver maybe. Seems easier to but reveal names. Your kid is less likely to respond to, \"hey cupcake\" and be like, of this person definitely knows my family when they cannot even say kids name. So if Bambi is the SM nickname the kids should not be used to being called Bambi irl. \n\nSo the whole point of the name effecting her influence status is dumb, because kids name shouldn't be known to her dozen followers who aren't known irl anyway.", "He's not an asshole lol\n\nLike, imagine your spouse wants your kid to get a face tattoo. You say no. Wife schedules the appointment with the tattoo artist anyway. When the time comes, the wife is out of town so you don't take your kid to the tattoo parlor.\n\nAnd you're here saying the guy not taking his kid to the tattoo parlor is an asshole.", "Why? He kept her middle name as Plum. So she can call her Bambi Plum now . The husband literally thought of the perfect compromise", "This, exactly.", "she also went behind his back with the whole name reveal on the banner for her baby shower. was it an asshole move from OP? towards the wife, yes. towards his newborn human being that's gonna someday thank her dad she doesn't have to write 'Bambi Plumb' on her official documents, no. wife was a major asshole for just deciding on a name on her own without any input or compromise because 'but my influencer career'. wanting to use your children for social media clout is peak asshole behaviour imho anyway.", "Yeah, she wasn\u2019t going to compromise. Saving the baby\u2019s future was more important that the wife at this point. If she wants to divorce at least was to save the girl from her stupidity", "Frankly after OP\u2019s edit about his wife\u2019s anger management problems, I\u2019d be concerned about the baby\u2019s safety.  She sounds unhinged and possibly dangerous.  Is she going to shake \u201cBambi\u201d when the baby isn\u2019t being a perfect, cheerful, doesn\u2019t cry at night instagram baby?  Is she going to focus on getting the perfect pictures and clip\u2019s rather than focusing on the child\u2019s needs?  Parents like her destroy children emotionally, mentally, and in many cases, physically.  Think about that OP.\n\nEdit:  huge NTA", "I mean, I guess that would then beg the question about why OP was even with this woman in the first place, let alone have a kid with her.", "Precisely. This is not an ESH. The wife had already done what the ESH folks are accusing him of, he did the objectively right thing.", "And the wife went behind his back with the big name reveal so him \u201cbreaking her trust\u201d is ridiculous to me", "How is it E S H?\n\nSeriously. He had no other choice.!", "Amen....", "she literally told OP he was ruining her life *by suggesting normal names*. This is not a woman who compromises", "No what they mean is OP chose a piece of work to have a baby with, and she should not have pulled any these stunts. \n\nThere are other ways he could have stopped the name, they just require a spine. She's going to be unhappy whether he puts his foot down or goes behind her back to do what he did, and he chose the cowardly way.", "You seem to know his wife really well based on a few paragraphs. Are you secretly banging her?\n\nThere\u2019s no way to conclude the the ONLY options were to either agree or go behind her back. \n\nMaybe they\u2019re the only options if you don\u2019t know how to communicate with your wife.", "This would fall under justified AH, but still an AH move.", "He caved to stop the fight when he should have stood his ground during the fight. I agree compromise isn't possible with a lunatic and I'm not saying nor suggesting compromise - he had an obligation to stand up for his child and he caved to shut her up knowing that doesn't solve anything. He made it worse by agreeing in the moment. She may have been raging but he should never have agreed to appease her. But she's an absolute fucking loon so who knows how that would have worked out.", "Well, maybe he's not an asshole but in my book he at last sucks a bit for choosing to have a child with someone who flies into such a rage they start to throw stuff and harm themselves when things don't go their way. That's really not the environment to bring up a child in. Then he pacified her with a lie instead of actually dealing with the situation. What's going to happen when the child gets older and decides not to play along with mom's influencer life? Is she going to throw stuff again? Will the child have to perform for her followers?", "OP is doing this to salvage something of this kid's life. But he is the AH to his kid?", "Sure, but his \"going behind her back\" involved signing legally enforceable documents, and hers was an Instagram post she could just delete.", "I don\u2019t know who the other 3 are, but Elon\u2019s kid is the child of a billionaire\u2026 life treats you much differently when you come from that kind of wealth and will be much more forgiving about a \u2018unique\u2019 name.", "But it\u2019s destiny! - No, Destiny strips in Vegas.", "Coming to the stage Bambi Plum", "Have to agree. I know a Bambi and have always thought it was a stripper name.", "I was thinking this exact same thing.", "I'm Asian... and have 2 friends named Bambi (nicknames).\n\nIt's the combo of Bambi + Plum that is just.... \n\nEDIT: NTA", "Yeah, but Bambi ain't that weird compared to our Asian name.\n\nI mean some Asian have western names, some have names in their local regional/tribal language, and some have names that are considered common there but sounded weird as fuck for foreigners.\n\nBambi seemed tame in comparison.\n\nAnd from my experience in school, we rarely bully each other over weird name. We usually bully each other based on looks and race instead.", "Wait, it's not based on the disney movie?", "Husband and I used that strategy - both of us could outright reject and ban a name suggested by the other.", "Faline sounds like a new MTG card race. \"We have Faeries and now introducing the Faline! A new theme pack similar to styles of Lorwyn or Morningtide.\"\n\nEDIT: Man I missed Friday night booster drafts!", "The book spells it Faline, I think. Feline is for cats.", "Plumbher", "Depending on their location, she can file that he was wrong and change the name without his consent.", "Yeah, by this logic they would say ESH because he shouldn't have had a baby with someone who would name their daughter Bambi. It's like, you can only control so much of this situation.", "I do not understand why people have children under these circumstances. Do they think that having children will just make everything else go away?", "What is ESH?", "...he said that he objected to the name and she responded by *flying into a rage* and accusing him of trying to sabotage her. \n\nI suppose I'm just too immature to recognize that as a sign of someone being super rational and open to compromise. My bad.", "You have some twisted mind.    \nThe wife is a cuckoo and you are the one that flew over the cuckoo\u2019s nest", "Wife is super crazy. She\u2019s got severe anger management issues and does NOT understand how to compromise. Hubby was stuck with making the best decision he could under the circumstances. He saved his daughter from having a stripper name. Wife wants to be an \u201cinfluencer\u201d which I feel is the most overrated and useless thing a person can be.", "She was threatening self injury and was known to self injure in the past when enraged. In those situations you don\u2019t stand your ground; the correct thing to do is deescalate.", "Honestly, if she's as bad as he says, if he had stood his ground then he likely would have had to call to get her admitted. Now that I think about it, it would have been better for everyone if he *had* done that.", "Look at the mother he chose for her.", "She is delusional. He should have communicated his veto better. I still think what he did is for the best interest of the child.", "She opens for Shadynasty.", "Truth. I saw Destinee's strip in Vegas.", "Nicknames are a different story. But yeah I agree the Plum part doesn't help. Why is he keeping Plum? Unless it's their real last name.", "Depends where in Asia I guess. Here Bambi is definitely super weird and kids do bully each other if their names are weird. We don't really bully each other based on races because almost everyone is the same race anyway.", "It is definitely Faline.", "She also picked it without his consent", "Really? What backwards ass country let's you do that??", "Who the hell would have imagined she would like to name their baby Bambi behind his back just to be an influencer?", "Everyone sucks here", "It's this kind of thing that makes me wonder why they're married in the place, let alone having a child together. They seem way too incompatible.", "But why impregnate someone OP has to basically treat like a bomb about to explode?", "He doesn't say any of that in the post unless he's made an edit.", "Well, what i meant by race is more our tribal differences or sub-race. \n\nCorrect me if im wrong, but don't we usually divide race by the geography of where they live, the cultural heritage, and tradition, etc.\n\nIm not really good at words, but basically this\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_(human_categorization)", "Exactly ESH.\n\nEdit to add:   She oxide but it wasn\u2019 put on legal documents.  He put it on a legal document. \n\nI\u2019m interested to see what the first two weeks were like.", "Let me guess the US?", "Good question\u2026 Sunk cost fallacy? Or maybe it\u2019s something that started due to hormones during fertility treatments, so he feels obligated/responsible? Straight up infatuation? Who knows!", "He did add an edit about his wife\u2019s anger issues."]}
