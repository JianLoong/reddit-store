You really thought that would go over well?  Why not focus on encouraging her to *keep* the weight off in healthy ways instead, or see a therapist if you\u2019re worried about the pattern?  Or at least encourage her to sell rather than donate the clothes, if you\u2019re worried about recouping costs?\n\nAlso:\n\n> she didn't even pack my lunch for work today\n\nHere\u2019s a thought: maybe give her fewer excuses to be in the kitchen around food, and make your own lunch?", "YTA \n\nThey're HER clothes and YOU should be packing your own lunches anyway.", "I get your point, but by being unsupportive, not having any faith in her, you'll just alienate her.

Dude.  Major YTA.  Not just for trying to control your wife and what she does, but for thinking your opinion = logic and hers is just \u201cbeing mad at me\u201d.  \n\n\u201cI tried to make her see my point\u201d did you try to see hers?  She doesn\u2019t have to do what you say, and she doesn\u2019t have to pack you a damm lunch.", "I'm sorry OP, but I think this is one of those rare instances where the exercise of common sense still makes you an AH.  There is no way for you to truly support your wife while still saying \"let's keep the big clothes just in case you put the weight back on.\" Yes, clothes are expensive, but so is divorce.   Enjoy your air sandwich and YTA."]}
