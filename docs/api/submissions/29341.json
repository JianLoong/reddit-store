I won't go over the specifics on how it ended but it was very messy. Due to the results of the divorce I had to move out of my husband's home and move in with my father. \n\nUnfortunately my father passed away a few years ago and I was now stuck paying two separate mortgages. One for my dad's house and one for my ex husband's. Since my name was also on the house along with his. I was stuck with a hard decision but I ultimately decided to sell my dad's house and move back in with my ex. He agreed. That was a terrible decision. I had not been back to the inside house for years but it had become trashed. No running water, the electricity was fried, rats, roaches, sewage etc. He basically only lived in one room of the house. \n\nI spent a year trying to fix it up with the remaining money I had from selling my dad's home. And it drained pretty quickly, thankfully my son was there to help fix it up with me. Finally when I looked at the home my expenses were absolutely drained. And it still was barely livable. Plus having to live with all his behaviors and the way he treated my son was not acceptable. I finally decided to put my foot down and move on my own for the first time, out of state. Which required me to remind my ex that he had to sell his house. Which was actually in our divorce settlement but I never had the heart to kick him out before. He agreed so we started the process. Now we've all moved out and our starting new lives. \n\nExcept for one little thing. His family. My ex decided to settle for a trailer and I bought it for him as an out. I even paid for his moving expenses to have all of his things stored while he looked for a new home. They're saying I'm cruel and a bitch for kicking him out of his father's home and that he's not capable enough to take care of himself. Now I've taken care of him as long as I've known him and even after our divorce. I brought him groceries, gave him old cars, paid his bills while still paying my own, and paying his mortgage with no help from him. Not to mention years and years of child support he never paid. I've heard the argument from him and his family that he had renters, which doesn't really matter. Considering he would give the renters money to me and I would use it to pay his bills.\n\nI'm just torn and not sure what I should do, my son tells me I'm not the asshole but everyone else in the family seems to think so. What do you think?\n\nEdit: I thought I should get some things out of the way I didn't address to begin with.\n\n1.) I had to move in with my father due to my ex filing a false restraining order against me.\n\n2.) Under the court order it was set that I was to give him time to \"fix up\" the house which obviously I should've forced the sale immediately but I felt bad and wanted to let him keep his space. Also for the sake of our child.\n \n3.) We were also suffering with a crazy neighbor at my dad's home. I didn't feel safe for me or my child so that's what ultimately led to the move. \n\n4.) A lot of court things i ultimately didn't have time off work for unfortunately. I worked and still do work 9-5 weekly under a private company that offered me no time off. And for my area I couldn't afford being fired by my anal boss to go to court.\n\nI'm happy to further edit to answer anything else.", "created_utc": 1697847110, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17cpk9t/aita_for_making_my_ex_husband_sell_his_childhood/", "score": 177, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You didn't make him do anything and the house should've been sold as per the divorce settlement.\n\nTwo, that house wasn't livable due to his negligence. His situation was one of his own making and you sunk a lot of money into trying to fix it, which I get since you were stuck there for a time. But you also said that he's just generally irresponsible and the only reason he has someplace livable is because you went above and beyond and brought him somewhere to stay. That's a kindness that he wouldn't have offered you based on how he behaved towards you and your son.\n\nThree, you continued to take care of him even after your divorce and I suggest you stop. His family is calling you an AH because even as an ex, you were still his caretaker (because doing everything you've been doing is not a wife's job - he's a grown man and fully capable of taking care of himself). That and because they themselves allowed him to behave like an AH and live in a home that should've been condemned. The only renters you have in a house like that are crackheads and squatters tbh.", "NTA", "I think he was capable enough to reproduce so he should be capable enough to do the bare minimum to stay alive.

You did more for him than he deserved.  He's a grown ass man and needs to figure his own shit out at this point. His family is more than free to take care of him if they like. Your responsibility for looking after him ended when you divorced.", "NTA Time to get rid of the deadweight that is called your ex-husband and MoveOn. He\u2019s a grown man and he needs to learn to manage on his own.", "NTA. Of course his family tells you you are an asshole- they don't want the responsibility of looking after him. Remind them that he is no longer family to you, but he is still theirs!", "NTA.  \n\nYou had to sell YOUR father\u2019s house too.\n\nTen years later, I cannot imagine putting up with the same behaviors that made you divorce him is any fun.", "NTA.. has everyone else paid everything for your ex and taken care of him.. did everyone else help pay the mortgage. Did they help work on the house..

Make sure you let child support enforcement know about the child support order that he won\u2019t pay.  \n\nThey should have been garnishing the funds from his pay years ago.  If he gets to a point where he draws his social security and he still owes, they will hold some of the social security funds and send them to you until the debt is paid. \n\nIm sorry you sold your father\u2019s home that you had been living in, only to have to used the funds to try to deal with the disaster your Ex couldn\u2019t be bothered to handle.", "INFO: Why not sell your half of the house with the ex back to him, or force a sale entirely, and use the proceeds to move into your own place? Were there truly no other options other than moving in with your father and then in with your ex? They money you spent supporting him could have been put to better use.

He didn't take care of his home, that's not on you. Move on with your life without him.", "Good Lord this is such a bad series of decisions.  How do you move in without seeing what condition the house was in first?  Why didn't you follow up and force the sale after giving time to fix up the house?
