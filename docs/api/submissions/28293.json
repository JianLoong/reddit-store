My usual workspace is a shared office with my managers and the laboratory, I also assist the technical team with supplier documentation due to my auditing background.\r  \n\r  \nwe have a lab technician, let's call her EM. Our first interaction was a bit peculiar as she questioned how I could speak fluent English, or if I might have learned it after coming to the UK. she generally comments how the previous NPD was a good fit and how he managed the place better. since i dint interact with her on a regular basis, I didn't think much of it at the time.\r  \n\r  \nHere's the issue: Fast forward to this week, we had a client visit for a product launch, and after conducting experiments and tests in the lab, it was messy. So, I approached EM and asked if I could return after lunch to clean up, to which she agreed without any apparent issues. I came back around 2:15 pm, tidied up the equipment, work surfaces, and followed standard procedures. Then, I went back to my office and left work as usual.\r  \n\r  \nThe next morning, I was surprised to find an email from EM in my inbox, which said, \"OP, Please make sure that you thoroughly clean all the equipment utilized in the laboratory, including work surfaces and balances. I already have a workload that is more than manageable and I appreciate not having additional tasks. I tried phoning you at 3.50, but it would appear that you had already left before your agreed finish time of 4 pm.

She complained about my lack of teamwork and presence in the lab, suggesting I should help out more. Very confused what she meant by it, i asked if the lab was in a bad condition other than the pots and beakers drying, to which she said no that was alright. \n\nShe also complained about me being in the office or on my phone too much. which I clarified  i am working with the technical team, audit paperwork are a priority at the moment. (Not that i need to justify my time to her , but felt guilt for all the accusations)   \n\n\nI insisted on having a manager present for any further discussion. Then she complained I do not have experience in the work culture so i dont understand . She said \" i tried to talk to you and thought you will be a grown up about this.\"  \n\n\nThis has been reported to my managers and they have advised me to not have any conversations with her until we hold a formal meeting to address this. \n\n\\~ we currently do not have a HR , but usually have all our managers and MD taking decision on matters together.", "NTA.\n\nEM is obviously biased against you (especially with the 'how come you speak fluent English?' comment) and is just trying to mess with you.\n\nIf she shows more signs of discrimination, better report her.", "NTA.  EM\u2019s behavior towards you is racist!  I would cover yourself by providing all the information you posted here to your managers.  Then I would encourage that you, your managers and EM to meet to discuss what the real issue is with EM.  Do you have Human Resources at your job?  Good luck!!  Hugs \ud83e\udd17", ">she questioned how I could speak fluent English\n\nIt's difficult to say who's in the wrong wrt to the cleaning of the lab, but she is clearly an AH and a bigot based on this. It sounds as though she was predisposed to find fault with you and based on that, I'm going with NTA until more info is provided.", "NTA\n\nBe very careful. EM may have some specific requirements for what clean means, EM may be a reasonable but fastidious human being. But it is also possible that they have a problem with you, it could be racism related, and your professional reputation is at risk.\n\nShe is prepared to escalate issues to your manager and make insinuations about your professionalism without first talking to you. This is a huge red flag.\n\nGo meet with her, take detailed notes, and be non-reactive. Interact with her by-the-book as much as possible. If she makes any comments at all about your spoken or written English, about your heritage or background, lodge a complaint about it with HR. Get something on the record about her any time she makes you uncomfortable. You don't need to raise a grievance, but you do need HR to have it on record.\n\nIf you get a detailed description of what was \"wrong\" with the lab after you had cleaned it, I'd suggest reply-all on her group email when you are back at your desk with the notes.\n\n\"I spoke directly with EM today about the issue she raised. I had considered the lab clean after I had followed standard procedures tidying it yesterday at 2:15 pm but EM has specified that the following standards need to be met beyond what I was aware of: <list> Going forward, I will make efforts to meet these requirements.\n\nI can generally be reached at my desk until 4pm, but in some instances I may be dealing with a work-related matter after leaving my desk on my way out of the office. I would not usually mention, but I want to make it clear, on record, that I work my full contracted hours and am almost always still in the building after 4, as I am sure my electronic fob record shows.\"\n\nGood luck my friend. Hope it goes well.", "This is unnecessarily aggressive.\n\nEM is the lab tech in charge of the lab you use. If she has issues with you not cleaning up after yourself properly, then \"I tried to call but got no answer, so here's an email\" is fine. It is normal to copy your line manager on these kinds of communications.\n\nWhat's not normal, and not OK, is her snide little line about \"I tried to call at 3.50 but you seemed to have left for the day before your agreed time of 4pm\". That's needlessly aggressive. \"I tried calling but you weren't at your desk\" would be factually correct without her unsupported allegations that you were leaving early.\n\nIt's quite likely that what you consider \"decently clean\" and what EM considers acceptable aren't quite the same. And perhaps in person she'd have just said \"hey, you can't leave the balance in that state\" or something.\n\nI think NAH so far.", "NTA. You might not have an HR department but I think your managers would have to take it very seriously if you imply or outright say her criticisms have a racial component to them and bring up her asking you about speaking English. You shouldn't have to put up with someone like that and bringing it up is fair game if you want to get rid of her", "NTA,\n\nBut be prepared to work to perfection from here on out. That person sounds racist, to point out your English. I\u2019d report her for that.", "INFO: Did you leave the place dirty while making an early exit? What's \"decent\" to you? It sounds like you left (approved), came back, cleaned, but didn't do a good job. You left things in the drying rack for her to put away and left early, so you didn't actually complete the clean.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Sounds like EM has a grudge against you for some reason", "Sounds like you\u2019re good. When with a manager be sure to be specific and to ask for as many specific examples to which EM complaining has none.", "Very glad you insisted on having a manager there going forward, and that you told them about this. EM is both clearly racist, and going out of her way to look for some sort of problem to pin on you, even if she has to make something up. Hopefully the managers will realise this and do something about it.", "What you could do is prepare a doc accounting for your time during a typical day. Like, from 8 to 9 I do this, from 9 to 12, I do this, etc. Then you sum it up saying that \"generally, in a day, I spend x hours doing this and x hours doing this,\" etc. The doc must be written and printed so you can give one to her and one to each manager.\n\nIf you have different type of work days prepare three parts in the doc, day type A, this is what I do, day type B, this is what I do, etc. \n\n\nAlso, about the lab being clean. She said in writing, copied to the highers up, that it was dirty, but she only said orally to you that it was fine, right? You have to write this interaction in an email, or at least mention it first during the meeting. \"I want to mention, about the lab being dirty, that I came back to check and the place was fine, and then we talked about it you told me orally that it was fine and I didn't do anything wrong, so can we consider this matter officially resolved?\" Your managers have to hear it.\n\nIf the meeting goes well, then great. If it doesn't, say that there were a few strange interactions, and repeat what she said about your English, etc, citing time and place. Then say, \"I am worried that there is some kind of racism at play here.\"\n\nGood luck!", "Before I saw the update I was going to urge you to have a third party there!  Now that is happening - good for you for having your manager present for further discussions.  Stick with that!  There is a problem manager where I work.  I had to redirect her to my manager after numerous overstepping on her part.  Now I do not answer the phone when she calls, and I reply to all voicemail with an email summarizing the voicemail.  If you can avoid one-on-one do so at all costs and good luck!  She sounds like the problem!", "Hi,   \nSo, by decent, i meant, standard clean up i.e - cleaning all the utensils we used and putting them on the drying rack, cleaning the worktops with IPA sprays and rubbing it down, disposing of all raw materials used.   \nAs for the drying racks, No, usually we leave them over night on the drying racks to come back the next day and put them back into place. These arent lab equipment but rather NPD beakers and such, which she isnt responsible for."]}
