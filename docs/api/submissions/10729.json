I think back thinking i was stupid but without that stupidity i would never have my kid and id never give them up for anything.   \n\n\nso what happened is that obviously they're curious about their dad and i decided it would be best not to tell them everything but once they're 12 i could tell them a bit of the story. so when they asked again yesterday i told them that well when i was 14 I met a bad man that took advantage of me but that i would go through that 100 times again just to be able to be their mom. i thought i handled it pretty well but my kid keeps apologising and even tho i have explained a lot that I love them no matter what they seem to be sad and idk what to do. i think they might have been too young to tell and im afraid i messed them up forever. \n\nmy gf says that i'm not in the wrong but i should've waited till they're a bit older. i think i messed. them up and now i'm so afraid they're going to be depressed like i was when i was their age and i just would do anything i wanted to break the cycle but i don't know how to deal with it. \n\nmy kid goes to a therapist once a month so i think they can talk with someone but I  probably should make it weekly. also english isn't my first language so sorry for any mistakes.", "created_utc": 1677148725, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/119undc/aita_for_telling_my_kid_who_their_dad_is/", "score": 80, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You\u2019re both doing your best. Nobody is in the wrong, and you\u2019re right about weekly therapy", "NAH except the guy who abused you. \n\nTelling the truth didn't mess up your kid. It probably did give your kid something they'll need to process, so it's good that they have a therapist to talk to, but kids are resilient and they'll learn to absorb it with time. They would have had to learn how to deal with the reality eventually; I don't think it's going to be worse for them at this age than a later one.", "NAH, it's a hard situation and with something like this I think it's impossible to know the right thing to do. It's also nearly impossible for anyone on here to tell you whether it's right or wrong without having been in a similar position. It's happened now don't beat yourself up over it. It's better coming from you than someone else letting it slip.", "NTA you did it in a very age appropriate way and you didn't give TMI. Since you mentioned a therapist give them a heads up to what is going on.", "I hate this kind of posts. Is there even a book, a manual or something that gives indications on what is the appropriate age for telling kids things like this? If you wait, \"why didn't you tell me earlier?\", If you tell them too soon, \"you traumatized me!\". NTA, please reassure them that it's not their fault", "NAH. It sounds like you told them an age appropriate version of what happened with their father. Hiding it from them would cause them to think of it as something shameful when they eventually find out, as they would almost certainly do.\n\nYour child\u2019s reaction is understandable too though. From their point of view, something that hurt their mother lead to their existence. If you continue to tell them that while it was a bad experience, you wouldn\u2019t change it for the world as it gave you the miracle of them and you wouldn\u2019t change them for all the universe, they will start to believe it. Reassure them as often as they need, and it will sink in. Seeing a therapist is a great idea, the therapist will help them understand their thoughts and process their feelings about it. You did the right thing, give them time and keep giving them love and reassurance. It sounds like you\u2019re an amazing mum.\n\nEdit: Obviously the guy who abused you is an AH. The only AH in this story. And the biggest imaginable. I\u2019m sorry you experienced something so awful \ud83d\udc94", "NTA. \n\nFirst, I'm sorry to hear that happened to you! Second:\n\nThis was always gonna be a tough situation no matter what. But you held off on sharing too much until they were a bit older and made sure to remind them that they are loved (no matter what)....You clued in their therapist to let them know...You took all the steps you could think of to make this easier and best for them.\n\nIt might take them some time to process, of course; to go through all the feelings and everything. And hopefully their therapist can help them manage and process everything. Until then, I know it's hard, but know that you didn't do anything wrong and that this is going to take time for them to come to terms with, just like it did for you.", "NAH!", "NTA. Your child is at an age where the curiosity about a parent cannot be ignored. I think you handled it well- by being honest but focusing on the bond with your child. All the best.", "NTA\nIt's not a situation that could have ended in happy music playing. If course there is a fall-out. Your kid has a support system and a great mum. It was your choice to have them and you should tell them that the next time they apologize.", "NTA. Your kid wanted the truth, and you gave it to them. I would definitely up the therapy appointments and continue to reassure your child that they are not their father and that you love them.", "NTA, but if you haven't told the therapist about it already maybe mention it?", "NTA", "NTA. \nFirst, i am so sorry for what you went through.\nI agree with your friend about your kid being too young, but from what I gathered from your post, you seem to have a mature and sensitive kid (good job mom !). \nI would revisit the subject with the kid with more explanation that it is not their fault, they do not carry \u201cbad genes \u201c and emphasize that this changes nothing. It is good they have a therapist as well.", "NAH, except the bio dad. I\u2019m NC with my own father due to abuse issues and lately my 5yo has been asking questions. Her dad has a mum and dad but I only have a mum, so where is my dad? What to tell her? I wish I could just say he\u2019s dead and leave it at that. But unfortunately he\u2019s still around. I wish I could tell her he\u2019s a lovely man and he loves her very much but I\u2019d be lying through my teeth. In the end I settled on an age appropriate explanation where I said he\u2019s not in our family because he\u2019s a bad person who hurt us. She would be a lot more hurt to know that someone she loves and trusts lied to her than being told the truth of a guy she doesn\u2019t even know. I\u2019m censoring it and not detailing the abuse until she\u2019s an adult and old enough to handle it if she ever asks. But i\u2019m not lying for that AH.", "NAH.

Bi weekly might be a good in between option. Therapy can obviously be great but it's not a cure all. The news was always going to be upsetting but they need to know the truth.

There were plenty of non-conforming people around, you just didn't know because they were forced to hide it. My mom (circa 1940) just realized there was such a thing as aromantic/asexual - she cried tears of relief to find that there were other people who felt like she did. She also cried tears of regret for having married my dad, who was too loyal to leave a loveless, sexless marriage.", "i knew i was nonbinary at 10. maybe it was different from you but in this day and age there\u2019s a lot of information out there", "It's more like a 'I wasn't sexual enough at 12' thing probably. When I was 12 internet was almost non existent. Telephones were landlines and phone booths.

Kids have gender identity long before they grow into having sexuality", "You\u2019re doing a great job", "I know but before the 2000s gender identity wasn't a central part of our children's identities. We didn't have chosen pronouns, lot of them didn't even exist back then. Source: I was born in 1983. Downvote me if you like, but that will not change the fact that the question of gender identity gained widespread prominence in the early 2000s and after. This is why lots of boomers like me don't understand how can somebody be NB before puberty.  I try hard but even the concept eludes me. Whatever, really.", "Gender identity has always been a prominent part of identity. Kids did have pronouns prior to 2000- he and she. If anything there was a greater emphasis on socializing kids to understand gender earlier than there is now. Pink for girls blue for boys- that is gender identity. If you understood yourself to be a boy or a girl in childhood then you had a gender identity. The difference is that now people lean more towards self-determination  and exploration rather than going entirely on genitals"]}
