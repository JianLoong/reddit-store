Does he stay up late with you in common areas? Is there a reason your parents are unable to control his bed time?\n\nEdit after response: NTA there is no reason your brother should be aware of how late you are up, and if he's up too late that's a failure on your parents. It may also just be that he is 11, going through puberty, starting to fight for independence, and your parents aren't ready for that and are choosing to blame you instead.", "NTA.

But your brother will probably look at the things you do and think it's ok or how one should behave. Just keep that in mind. Also I find it abhorrent that your dad brought this to you.", "NTA. Unless you're like forcing your brother to stay awake (which it really doesn't seem like you're doing) then this has nothing to do with you. You're not his parent.", "NTA\n\nBut, you might want to take some time to think about the fact that, whether you like it or not, your brother will likely look up to you and copy actions.", "NTA. Why can't your parents enforce a bed time? It falls on them not you.", "NTA, but consider that your brother may look up to you and copy your behavior. So your staying up late sets a poor example forr him. In addition it may have effects on your health because not getting enough sleep can effect your performance in school and other activities. My suggestion to solve this issue is for you to go to bed earlier.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Is your stepdad trying to tell you to adhere to your own bedtime? Tentatively, it sounds like your stepdad could be trying to explain to you why it\u2019s important for you to follow your bedtime too.", "NTA. It\u2019s not your job to parent. If your brother is staying up playing video games then your parents need to talk with him. You have nothing to do with it.", "NTA.", "NTA", "The step dad has to talk with mom about how much he parent her kids and then mom needs to talk to the kids. The op seems a bit defiant but he is her stepdad so there should be some clarity over his parenting role.", "People telling you your bro may be looking up to you as an example is absolutely ridiculous.  When you go to bed has no bearing on when an 11 year old goes to bed. Do not let these people make you feel in the wrong.  Every now and then I come across skips of paper saying unfair kid cause I had an older sibling - lol", "Nta and for all the commentary about but the brother will copy your behaivor... umm 15yr old girl with door closed how the heck can the 11m tell she is awake unless he is spying on his stepsister which is a whole creey other kettle of fish.", "You shouldnt be staying up that late. Your step dad and mom should be on both of your asses.\n\nThose downvoting me don\u2019t have kids.", "YTA\n\nYou're not responsible for your brother but it seems like the \"and it's a bad example for your brother\" is an additional point to \"you shouldn't be staying up so late you need sleep\" which is probably fair.\n\nEdit to be clear: just stop doing the thing you seem to admit is a problem, then the one of various reasons you objected to won't be a factor any more", "He usually stays up late playing videogames", "He told me that I was setting a bad example for him. However me staying up late never caused any problems. On schooldays im the first one to be awake in the house. We have separate rooms so I wouldn't say I'm stopping him from going to sleep", "Yeah, the \u201cyou\u2019re setting a bad example\u201d tactic is a real Hail Mary pass when you\u2019re dealing with teenagers, I can\u2019t believe this guy thought it was going to work. \n\nOP is NTA, stepdad had just lost control of the situation and was mad about it.", "Nope, why should she go to bed earlier then she needs to.  Setting a bad example is BS.\nShe doesn\u2019t need to parent her brother and it\u2019s not her responsibility to lay in bed awake while her bro is most likely playing video games in his room. Simple solution is take the gaming stuff out of his room.", "I dont have a set bedtime, just as long as I wake up early on a school day, which I do", "They should be parenting.

I was certainly doing far worse by 15 then just staying up until midnight or 2 am. Even still, I don't think a higschool aged teenager staying up late is enough to qualify them as TA, at worst I think NAH unless OP is somehow responsible for her brother's bedtime.", "Is he playing video games late at night in his room? If so, it seems that maybe the adults should remove things like that from his room.", "Sorry, another question \u2014 is it affecting his daily routine at all?", "Why don't your parents control his bed time?", "Definitely NTA. You are 100% correct that it is not your responsibility. Guarantee you that your stepfather knows that that is true but wasn't counting on you to know that as well so he got mad for being called out.", "I assume from the OP that brother is aware of what's going on (because telling that story with step Dad accusing her of setting a bad example and her not saying \"but I keep it secret from my little brother anyway\")", "I think a lot of 15 year olds were but that doesn't change that lack of sleep affects brain development, ability to focus is school etc. I guess my judgement isn't based on her initial act but the annoyance at her Step Dad raising it - you were doing something you shouldn't, you were called out in it, stop doing it instead of fussing that you don't like one of the (multiple) reasons you were given for it being an issue.", "Not really, throughout the day hes fine and running around the house with his friends", "They do on school nights, he gets his phone taken away.", "what are you genuinely smoking", "are we even reading the same post?

(we can guess the reasons) and also it's a bad influence for your brother.\nIf she's accepted at the first reasons the last one will be saved anyway so issue solved.", "Thats on the brother then, not her", "Not her problem.", "He is not her father. She has not to be a example. The mother of OP not him either should be parenting.", "NTA your brother is not your problem or your responsibility you hit the nail on the head with that one.", "My first question is why is he having this conversation with you instead of your mum? Step parents need some authority eg asking OP to do her chores. But I find it really odd that your stepfather has brought this up instead of your mum. My husband and I discussed our kids bedtime changes together and then gave our joint decision to our children. I notice that he presented it as \"OP a bad influence\" and not \"this is something your mother and I have agreed on\". I suspect stepdad has gone behind your mother's back to have this conversation with you. I am not sure if he has discussed it with her and your mother said no, or if he just decided to keep her out of this particular conversation. If he drops it, I would probably let this go. But if he keeps getting angry, you may want to have a chat with your mum. \n\nHaving said that, I doubt you are getting enough sleep if you are going to bed at 2am and getting up to go to school on time the next day. But that is your mothers call and your stepdad brought this up because your brother doesn't listen to him, not because he was concerned about your health.

Ignore the people telling you that you are your brothers keeper.", "Absolutely NTA\n\n11 is about the age both my kids transitioned to the \"Stay up late sleep in late\" stage of adolescence. This is a biological change, and not behaviour you pick up purely because of a \"bad example\" \n\nI do have a tiny bit of sympathy for your Step-Dad because for me, having the kids up later eats into my evening and my chance to have quiet evening time with my wife (their mum).\nBut, that's part of the deal of being a parent - I know I did the same to my parents. Your Step-Dad might not have realised it, but this is absolutely what he signed up for when he married a woman with children. If you and your brother are otherwise behaving yourselves, he needs to get over himself.", "\"Is her responsibility\" implies he's asking her to make sure her brother goes to bed, he isn't, he just pointed out she's setting a bad example for him (as well as all all the other reasons she needs to go to bed earlier)"]}
