But I can try to help you understand how ridiculous that guy is being.  \n\n\nFrom what I have heard and seen.  Many American hair schools don\u2019t have an extensive \u201ccurly hair\u201d class.  From my friends who are currently in school or went to school here.  The education on how to deal with black hair is lacking. it feels like \u201cstraight or wavy\u201d hair is the go-to style that is deemed beautiful.  And for the hair types that can achieve straight hair with out much damage, they didn\u2019t need stylist to be any more skilled than that.  But lately so many people of other races In Our country are beginning to follow \u201cnatural black girl\u201d curl routines.  Because it\u2019s GREAT for curly hair. And they are FLOURISHING. I have seen more natural hair salons now then I ever did when I was younger.  \n\n\nAlso! In some neighborhoods it\u2019s dangerous for a black person to get their hair done at a Hispanic or white salon because those places sometimes put chemicals in the hair to \u201cmake it easier\u201d to work with.  Causing permanent damage. \n\nsome people get super possessive over things they worked hard to develop. Natural hair salons were not really that common for us before the curly hair movement. So when they see \u201cothers\u201d use services we specifically developed because our hair was excluded in hair education\u2026 they get angry. Obviously this is on the perspective of an American.  You country sounds awesome! Salons based on hair type would be DOPE \n\nAmericans can be exhausting.

You usually are just praying that they dont mess your hair up because half the stylists out there dont have a clue how to manage curls. Curly hair needs special treatmeant, you need somebody who is experienced and knows what they are doing. As someone with a very thick head of curly hair, I would go to a stylist of absolutely ANY race as long as they knew what they were doing with curly hair. It's very hard to find someone good and I don't see why OP should not patronise somebody's business because of their race. It's racist and just a shit attitude if im being honest. \n\nIf the stylist had an issue, I am sure she wouldn't have accepted the business and could have said she had no vacancies. Small businesses need patronage and support.

He said it perfectly. It has nothing to do with him. Full stop. So why\u2019s he running his mouth?", "Well said.", "> There\u2019s literally nothing cultural about the way we take care of our hair.\n\nEhhhhh this is slightly caveated. There are definitely cultural aspects about certain hair styles to certain people (eg mud braids, dreadlocks both do have cultural meaning) but the bigger thing is that hair and culture do relate, and black hair is cultural because it's **not the same as white hair** and therefore needs to be treated differently. It's more about the hair, and the correlation/causation divide gets blurred (did the culture come before the hair styling, or the hair styling brought about the culture)", "Apropos of nothing, it probably is African hair.  Very usual for some Hispanic families to show African features.  The poor white settlers in New Spain and New Portugal never saw very much wrong with marrying a black woman if she was the best choice.  The aristocracy saw things a bit different but let's just say there's a reason that Brazillians and Colombians in particular as dark as they are.", "It never left!", "Latina is good enough for his dick but not for his... hairdresser? \ud83d\ude06\n\nStrange man.", "Not all Black people are African American. You're making assumptions.", "So do I - we have a selection from 2b -3b, & we've recently found a hairdresser who can sort of cope with it. It's worst for my husband - white guy with 3b hair, none of the barbers here have a clue, he ends up coming to the same women's hairdressers we do. Strangely, lots of products in shops aimed at caring for curly hair, so I wonder where all the curly people are getting their hair done....", "I don\u2019t know what a gobshite is, but I love that word.", "No, it is not true that black stylists only want black/curly clients.", "In this case, the stylist wanted the customer and a man wanted to tell her she shouldn't go there.  \n\nIn the US, some stylists do focus on one type of hair. Because 3b- 4c types of hair (kinky and curly) are usually associated with having African ancestry AND because of the history of white supremacy, slavery and racism in the US,  people with those hair types have sometimes been looked down on and mainstream hair services have not focused on them. Hair care products and salons were not able to provide for their needs. As a result, many black women and men go to specialized hair places, often owned by other black men and women.\n\nThey may be so specialized that the hairdresser is unfamiliar with thin straight hair but for the most part, I doubt it.  \n\nIn the US, hair salons are often cultural gathering places for African Americans, just as they can be for other groups. I suspect the man in OPs story felt that a safe space that was culturally \"his\"  was being invaded even though it wasn't his salon.  That wasn't his to decide, but I suspect it was simply emotional as a result of many years of African American hair being disvalued.  (For example,  black kids with dreads can be required to cut them off at school,  black women and men in the military have had unreasonable hair expectations put on them, black women in professional situations with natural hair have been told they are unprofessional.  These things are in the news here and leave a legacy )\n\nI'm sure your hairdresser is fine with whatever hair you have.  OP's host was in the wrong, and OP had every right to go to any hairdresser regardless of ancestry.   If you have interest in the subject,  though, there is a 2009 documentary called Good Hair and a docu series called  Hair Tales both of which get into the fraught history of black hair in America.", "&#x200B;\n\nThat is not the case in the USA, No barbershop would do that, on the contrary like op if i feel they didnt give me a good haircut i just go to another shop next time.", "Right I picked up on this too. He\u2019s gatekeeping black salons for black people but not for his marriage. Dudes running gymnastics is his mind", "really any country that has become part of Spanish America. We had a lot of mixing during the time of the Spanish government, and today we are still very mixed among ourselves. Large government entities still offer support to castes that have a large percentage of indigenous people, so we still have a caste system, just not very present or marked. No one really cares much about caste unless it serves them some purpose.", "That's a very broad brush you're painting an entire race with. Black people aren't a monolith with a hive mind. \n\nThis is very much a US problem and it's complicated. I can't speak for other white dominated countries.", "YTA for this comment. Why do you feel the need to generalize an entire group of people", "Youre not wrong that there is a problem with that, but you are wrong to generalize. The minority is often the loudest. Also theres probably more racist latinos than you realise, you just dont noticed it. And that applies to every race, because races arent a monolith.", "The opinions of 1 black person represent every black person in America?\ud83d\ude44", "My mother is a stylist, but she doesn't really know how to take care of my curls, (They are really thick. I say I'm 3c but there are people who tell me I could be 4a, idk) so I had to look for places specific to curly hair. And in my hometown there are several, I went through seven before deciding on one. The thing is that my hair is a mix of dry and oily and needs constant hydration and care, and none of the first salons I went to knew how to treat it. \nAnd again, I come from a country where we don't have such a strong race or race culture divide. I didn't see a problem in going to a salon run by a black woman, I just thought, hey, this place looks super nice and everyone here has curls like mine. I never thought about \"being disrespectful\" or \"invading.\"", "Ok, so, The caste issue is really not very important in my country. We have it in mind, of course, but is it because many times having ancestry from a vulnerable population is beneficial? We have between 20 and 30 castes, which refers to how \"mixed\" we are. My maternal great-grandmother is the daughter of a black man and an indigenous woman, and that alone provides her with economic and health benefits. My maternal grandfather is the son of Italians who came to my country during the wars, which gave him work benefits. My paternal grandfather was indigenous. That gave him economic benefits and (somewhat, due to his family and what community he belonged to) on land. My paternal grandmother was a Spanish woman. My mother is dark-skinned and my dad can't be whiter. My brothers have indigenous features with light and dark skin tones, and hair as straight as that of any indigenous person in my country. Incredibly straight and thin, which even the braids cannot hold. I, unlike my family nucleus, I have hair as curly (or more so) as my maternal grandmother had. I am also the darkest skinned person among my siblings and parents. I received college scholarship benefits due to my indigenous heritage, but again, I wouldn't know where I would qualify in the caste system other than \"indigenous ancestry\", I just know that I receive benefits, as well as physical features, from it. Latin America doesn't really emphasize skin color much. At least, not where I'm from. In just one family you can see light, dark skin tones, red, blonde, black, curly, wavy or straight hair.  \nI never knew the problems of race and color because I never lived them. I knew about racism in other countries, but it was always more of a concept or an idea, not something I had gone through.", "Why is the hair typing system problematic?", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).
