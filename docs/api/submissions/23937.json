I don\u2019t particularly like her friends, but that\u2019s irrelevant. Anyway, they were having fun. They bought some makeup and and tried on clothes, I bought them a couple outfits each but nothing super expensive. Then I noticed my daughter pocketing a lipgloss. I got really mad (usually I don\u2019t get mad) and I asked her In a pretty loud voice what she was doing. \n\nShe said nothing, and I made her turn out her pockets, and then I made her return it and apologize. A lot of people in the store were watching and so were her friends. Luckily the store people didn\u2019t make it a huge deal and we left. We went home straight away after that, and after we dropped off her friends my daughter was really angry with me. \n\nShe said i ruined her birthday and that i could have scolded her for stealing the lipgloss later, when we were alone. She said it didn\u2019t really matter that much and now her friends would tell everyone, and they\u2019d all look down on her. I remember middle school and how much it sucked.

And if she was that afraid of what her friends would say/think, she shouldn't have shoplifted while she was with them (which could have led to their getting in trouble too).\n\nYour daughter's behavior and response make me think that this probably wasn't her first time doing this and that you probably can't blame this on the influence of her friends.

Your kid was stealing so she\u2019s lucky it was you and not the store security that made a scene about it", "Nope, NTA.  This is something you handle immediately.  All of the embarrassment and shame were caused by her actions.

I remember when I was around five or six, I was with my mom at a store in the makeup section. I understood what stealing was, but I was a kid who didn\u2019t really get why it was bad. I also knew what lipstick was and that Mommy liked lipstick and I wanted to make Mommy happy. Mommy was not happy when we came home and I gave her a bright pink lipstick I had pocketed (it wasn\u2019t her color, IG?) So she drove me right back down while terrifying me with stories on how I was now a criminal and the police would take me to jail and I\u2019d never leave (I knew what jail was because I watched Cops with grandma). The store manager was laughing when she saw a six year old crying because she thought she was gonna go to prison for stealing a lipstick from Walgreens. But she accepted my apology and told me she wouldn\u2019t call the police on me. She explained why stealing is very wrong and why it\u2019s important to pay for things and that, while I may have just wanted my mom happy, she\u2019d be happier if I did good things like clean my room. My mom paid for the lipstick (I think she wanted me to start feeling better) and got me McDonald\u2019s on the way home. I never stole again. \n\nThe feelings I felt that day stayed with me and, while I laugh about it now (I guess my love of makeup was always with me), I knew it was an embarrassing and scary situation that taught me a valuable lesson. Man, I miss my mom. She was great.", "NTA she ruined her own birthday. \n\nMy parents probably would have taken it a step further and returned the clothes you actually bought her. Probably a little harsh but she is a teenager. \n\nYou were all there and you were obviously willing to spend money on her and her friends so it\u2019s clear she didn\u2019t have to steal.", "NTA\n\nIt's your job as a parent to guide your children and that's exactly what you did.

Your daughter was already being given lots of new clothes for her birthday, as were her friends. But she decided to shoplift, too. If she didn't want to get called out for stealing, great. DON'T STEAL. That was her choice and she gets to have the consequences of that choice. If her friends don't want to be friends with a thief, maybe they're better kids than you thought. The audacity to be pissed at YOU because she got caught stealing is nuts. She needs some real intervention now, before she gets herself in real trouble.", "NTA\n\nYour daughter though....wow. Such entitlement. I get that she was maybe trying to look cool to her friends, but *stealing*?? You did the right thing and called her out on it. Doing it in front of her friends will have a bigger impact on her (in a good way) than taking her aside to do it quietly. She won't steal again.", "NTA\n\nYou were being her parent rather than her friend. Kudos", "NTA, why the hell would you think YTA here??", "NTA- I stole something at 13. The store caught me and my friend.   My mom was so mad and told them to take me to jail (which they did not). I went and toured juvenile hall, and it was scary.  Never have stolen since. The point is that my mom was not worried about being my friend. She was worried about teaching me a lesson so I could be a successful adult.", "NTA. She ruined her own birthday.", "NTA, brat stole and thought it made her hot shit, a reality check was warranted, and the public shame of your peers is a proportional punishment from thievery. No one likes a thief, and that needs to be taught; if she didn\u2019t want to be ridiculed, should\u2019ve kept her sticky fingers to herself.", "NTA. You acted like a responsible parent.", "NTA.  The problem with many people today is their parents did not do what you did.  Good job, Mom.", "Of course she thinks you shouldn\u2019t have told her off and should of waited she\u2019s embarrassed that she got caught stealing and had to face consequences. 13 is more than old enough to know that stealing is illegal/wrong", "NTA your daughter is a thief! She needs to be outed!", "NTA -Good job Mom! If she loses friends for theft then that's the repercussions of her actions. She's lucky she didn't get caught and ALL of her friends be stopped by an employee and held until their parents and/or the police arrived. Her friends wouldn't be allowed to hangout with her...which is worse?", "NTA and good on you for immediately putting your daughter on the spot. Actions have consequences.\n\n\"Officer, I know I beat up this man but it's my birthday, you see?\" probably wouldn't fly either.", "NTA tell her what she did is called stealing and it's a crime. Better you nip this in the bud now before she continues. Honestly, you need to have a serious conversation with her about why she's doing this before she lands herself and you in trouble.\n\nAlso tell her that whats more embarrassing is being arrested for theft so she got a lucky break.", "NTA.  Perfect response and if it causes her to lose the friends you don't like all the better.\n\nMy guess is she'll think twice about shop lifting in the future.", "NTA. You are her parent, not her friend. You\u2019re job is to raise a good, productive member of society. If she loses friends that sucks for her but they were never her friends to begin with. Over the next 6 years you are not going to be a popular person. She will hate you, rage at you, want you to go away. But eventually she won\u2019t be a teenager anymore. Keep the course momma. You did the right thing.", "NTA. She did it. She might face the consequences.", "NTA. You don\u2019t have to accommodate her for something she did out there in public.

She deserved that and more if she's not contrite, and it sounds like she's not.", "NTA. She clearly knows the difference between right and wrong and is now angry at the prospect of suffering the consequences of her own bad decision, birthday notwithstanding. \n\nGood on you for holding her feet to the fire and holding her accountable.

My brother and his friend had a bad habit of stealing cards and Lego when they were in highschool, and they didn't stop until they were caught and got in trouble.

Honestly, I'd consider switching schools or making a big change if this current peer group is problematic.  That is a hard no way.\n\nMiddle school does suck.

Apparently if Reddit had been the judge they\u2019d have locked away a 13 yr old girl and thrown away the key.

I don\u2019t particularly like her friends, but that\u2019s irrelevant. Anyway, they were having fun. They bought some makeup and and tried on clothes, I bought them a couple outfits each but nothing super expensive. Then I noticed my daughter pocketing a lipgloss. I got really mad (usually I don\u2019t get mad) and I asked her In a pretty loud voice what she was doing. \n\nShe said nothing, and I made her turn out her pockets, and then I made her return it and apologize. A lot of people in the store were watching and so were her friends. Luckily the store people didn\u2019t make it a huge deal and we left. We went home straight away after that, and after we dropped off her friends my daughter was really angry with me. \n\nShe said she ruined her birthday and that she could have scolded me for stealing the lipgloss later, when we were alone. She said it didn\u2019t really matter that much and now her friends would tell everyone, and they\u2019d all look down on her. I remember middle school and how much it sucked. She might lose friends over this. Am I the asshole for not handling it in a quieter way?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "NTA. OP, she stole.

Sometimes that feels like being the asshole, but it's DEFINITELY not the same thing. \n\nMake her write a couple pages on the cumulative effects of theft on businesses. Or the effects of a police record on life outcomes in young people. Or the philosophy behind social contacts and the morality of what we owe each other in the name of common decency. Or the viral nature of behaviors within friend groups.", "NTA. guaranteed she was going to pass it off as really cool with her friends for stealing it. mad that she would even steal when you're buying her stuff?! she just needs to have more or steal for fun?!\n\nI absolutely stole as a child because my parents always said no and literally starved me otherwise. I don't think you're doing the same and you took her out for her birthday. I wonder if she steals more often than you know or if this is a first", "NTA like she made a bed she gets to sleep in it. \nQuestion though - why would she think that stealing is in any way okay?", "NTA. OP, as an additional punishment...might I suggest making her read some of these comments? Especially the top one about her parenting you. Maybe outside voices can make her understand why she was in the wrong. I'm sure you're a great parent, but it can be hard to reason with teenagers.", "Nta, well done, hopefully scared her straight.", "NTA.\n\nMiddle school does indeed suck, but it\u2019ll suck a lot more if she gets into the habit of committing petty crimes in order to maintain her place in the social pecking order.

It\u2019s how she\u2019ll learn where the boundaries are. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t be alarmed just yet, but keep an eye on this friend group of hers. If she\u2019s being pressured to do things she\u2019s uncomfortable with in order to avoid being ostracized, that\u2019s something you need to talk to her about, and not in a sit-down-while-I-talk-at-you way.

Period.\n\nKids find out? Kids are hard on her? YOU didn't do that. She did.  She made a choice to do an action, she learns through lipgloss that making bad choices have long lasting consequences that ripple. \nDon't protect her from her consequences,\nLet her learn that lesson. It's an important one. You make a bad choice, you can't take it back, and the cost is not usually worth it. (Thankfully it's theft of a lipgloss and nothing worse!)\n\nQuiet consequences? Really?

I feel she could have asked and before this incident the answer would have been yes, so there was no need to steal.\n\n2. Attention from her friends. She claims her firends will look down on her for stealing and tell everyone, so either she is guilt tripping you and that is a lie, or it's the truth and your daughter may have compulsive tendencies causing her to steal.

They actually told me i had escalated the situation by banning them. But they were 14yr olds smoking weed in the toilets in a youth club that accepts kids as young as 10!!! Like WTF!!

I wanted to tell the police everything i witnessed....My Mexican family cried and begged on there knees for me not to and to mind my own business. I understood and did as i was told.

It's a subreddit that discusses bad aquatic pet owners and why their tank is a bad setup. Someone cross-posted a large goldfish in a tiny aquarium that could barely turn around if it wanted to. What I'm assuming was Gen Z, came in and called OP a bunch of names, and how dare they. That's a goldfish that belongs to someone's grandmother, she doesn't know any better. These people were acting like OP personally insulted their own grandmas. I'm like okay? But it's still a shitty aquarium? \n\nIt seems Gen Z is so concerned about bullying that they go out and bully others way harder for even suggesting someone is doing something wrong. \n\nAnother one was a guy asking if he's an AH on AITAH. He was sharing a small air BnB with a bunch of guys on a trip. They had to share rooms, some sleeping on couches, others on floors, whatever.

OP had taken this guy's spot on the couch because the bed had a drunk guy in it, and he didn't want to be vomited on. There was a disagreement, and OP told the guy to kick rocks. People were calling OP an AH because he stole that guys spot on the couch, and the guy should be allowed to do whatever he pleases. It's not OP's business. But they're completely missing the point that the guy was planning on having sex in front of other non-consenting adults?

It\u2019s actually really had to care about nuance sometimes when you feel like the world, not just your parents or school but *everyone* and their mother walking the earth, is asking you to care about every tiny little event happening in every corner of the globe. It took me a long time to figure out that I wasn\u2019t responsible for making a decision about every hot issue or debate, and sometimes I could just say I don\u2019t really know yet, because the world doesn\u2019t really ask that of anyone, does it?

Of course, this may mean nothing but perhaps OP has a feeling her daughter is stealing to impress them? I don\u2019t know. I think parents have a sense though - if your kid is changing due to new friends, maybe the parent may not like these friends.", "That\u2019s what gets me. The talking back I don\u2019t think is all that unusual, but as a parent you shouldn\u2019t be phased by that. Kids NEED to feel discomfort sometimes in order to develop properly.", "It's not, though. It's only a nightmare if you let it be. Like coming on to reddit and asking us if they're the asshole after their daughter chewed them out for embarrassing her *for shoplifting*. The way to counter that is to remove any and all access to the Internet and ground her for the next 3 weeks, and make sure she knows good and well that A) her actions definitely caused this, B) it would've been 2 weeks but who the fuck is she to tell you how to parent, and C) you absolutely will not relent. People are overcorrecting with the sensitivity and consequently churning out a generation of snot nosed shitbags who think they're untouchable. I heard a kid (like an actual preteen) tell his mom to go fuck herself, seemingly with impunity, at the grocery store the other day, and I tell you I distinctly remember the sound of my mom breaking my CDs 1 by 1 the one time I said something like that to her in high school.", "\u201cthe way of the world\u201d you know kids don\u2019t parent themselves right?", "Yeah, 99% chance the friends shoplift. And if not, then maybe OP\u2019s kid will actually be shamed enough not to do it again.", "Telling a 6 year old she\u2019s going to jail is not great parenting. Wtf. Making her go back and apologize was the right thing to do, but letting your tiny kid believe you\u2019re going to let strangers take her away and lock her up is insane, mean-spirited, and shows a startlingly poor understanding of child psychology.", "Crazy power trip, the police part is specially out of pocket", "Not assuming anyone's race ofc but teenage white girls are probably the highest demographic for recreational stealing (idk how things like groceries factor in).

This is how you help them develop character and their own moral code. Kids under 5 will take whatever they see, like little gremlins,  but the older they get, the more they develop empathy, and not to just take things that don't belong to them.", "Nah cuz the embarrassment hadn't been punishment enough for her to see the consequences of her actions and wasn't learning from the experience. It truly depends on the kid as to what punishment is fit. But that's not a \"crazy\" power trip. Sometimes kids literally need *everything* taken away to learn something. As long as they have the basic necessities and a roof over their head, there is nothing wrong with taking away luxury items like gaming consoles, internet (unless for school assignment), television, etc. They're exactly that, a luxury item. A privilege.", "This lady sounds so toxic. Beating your kids is \"considered\" abuse?? No. How about it IS abuse. \"This generation\" comment, taking away \"friends...\" Toxic AF. I'm so glad my parents actually treated me like a real human being. You can punish your kid without doing this.", "Abso-freaking-lutely. Kids thinking they \"have the power\" is exactly the problem. Parents letting their kids think that way is why those kids are acting like little snots. And the police thing... please. Bro is a cop and do you want to know how many calls they get from entitled little snots thinking they \"have the power\" at the touch of a cell phone to put an end to their parent's \"power trips\" of very basic \"taking away your first-world privileges\" by calling the police and reporting it as \"child abuse\"? I didn't take away anything she is entitled to. She still had unlimited access to food, clean clothes, a bed, the ability to come in and out of her room as she pleases, plenty of toys, games, puzzles, and books, still went to school and to family members' houses. If you think taking away first world privileges is a power trip, then I wish you the best of luck with your kids and future grandkids.

There was so much emphasis on not hurting their feelings and not giving consequences, but sometimes consequences is how kids need to learn. \n\nI've had fellow teachers act like I'm a horrible disciplinarian for enforcing boundaries and letting kids experience consequences but they have very rarely connected the fact that my classes were well behaved and theirs were not to the fact that I enforce boundaries and have consequences.

Not just in real life, but I'm sure it can be incredibly difficult to enjoy your parenting groups. But agreed, I know the behavior of the younger generation is stemming from home.", "That reminds me of my days as a student teacher in a high school.. \n\nMy classroom (teaching AP history and English Lit) ((as a college senior with an education bachelors finishing my 2nd in liberal arts/law)) was right next door to the Spanish teachers.

I only heard that her classroom was full of assholes, and it made teaching impossible. \n\nThe scores were insanely low, and she always blamed it on the kids just not feeling comfortable. \n\nI was invited to sit in on one of her classes, as a ST intern who had taken Spanish for four years at the same HS. \n\nShe started to do a lesson about group tense in the language.

I was raised by Boomers who didn't understand anything about parenting, so maybe the amount of research I put in is what makes the difference, but so much of my time around other Millennials is spent explaining why my son is well-behaved. They can't figure out how to parent or what to do in even the most minor of inconveniences.   \n\n\nThe fact is, my son listens to me because I explain why he's being told no.
