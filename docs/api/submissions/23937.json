I don\u2019t particularly like her friends, but that\u2019s irrelevant. Anyway, they were having fun. They bought some makeup and and tried on clothes, I bought them a couple outfits each but nothing super expensive. Then I noticed my daughter pocketing a lipgloss. I got really mad (usually I don\u2019t get mad) and I asked her In a pretty loud voice what she was doing. \n\nShe said nothing, and I made her turn out her pockets, and then I made her return it and apologize. A lot of people in the store were watching and so were her friends. Luckily the store people didn\u2019t make it a huge deal and we left. We went home straight away after that, and after we dropped off her friends my daughter was really angry with me. \n\nShe said i ruined her birthday and that i could have scolded her for stealing the lipgloss later, when we were alone. She said it didn\u2019t really matter that much and now her friends would tell everyone, and they\u2019d all look down on her. I remember middle school and how much it sucked. She might lose friends over this. Am I the asshole for not handling it in a quieter way?", "created_utc": 1691246080, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15ix9up/aita_for_forcing_my_daughter_to_return_what_she/", "score": 776, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She has no one to blame but herself.", "NTA\n\nStore likely didn't kick up a fuss because you were a parent actually watching their kid who called them out when they stole. You did the hard part for them and public shaming is way more effective than anything they could do\n\nYour daughter got some nerve to not only steal, but to also do it in front of a parent", "NTA. Birthday girls don't get a free pass on shoplifting. And if she was that afraid of what her friends would say/think, she shouldn't have shoplifted while she was with them (which could have led to their getting in trouble too).\n\nYour daughter's behavior and response make me think that this probably wasn't her first time doing this and that you probably can't blame this on the influence of her friends. If I were you, I'd be scrutinizing what's going on with her.", "NTA you didn't ruin her Birthday - SHE ruined her own Birthday by stealing, her friends might tell everyone she is a thief and they might look down on her for that and she has learned a very important message DONT STEAL, if a security guard had caught her instead of you there would have been a different outcome, you handled this perfectly, you made a scene and made her return the item and appologise in front of her friends, sne might be angry and a bit   \nembarrassed right now but she has just found out that this behavour is unacceptable", "NTA. If she\u2019s angry at anyone it\u2019s herself. Actions have consequences.", "This was an amazing piece of parenting. I hope it traumatized her so much that she never does it again. NTA, and well done.", "NTA\n\nActions have consequences.", "NTA\nYour daughter was stealing and you took the appropriate action. The only person your daughter should be mad at or embarrassed by is herself. She\u2019s lucky it was you and not store security or police.", "NTA. You did exactly what a parent should do and taught her a valuable lesson. If she feels shame, she should. And it should serve as a lifelong reminder to her to not be a thief.", "NTA. Your kid was stealing so she\u2019s lucky it was you and not the store security that made a scene about it", "Nope, NTA.  This is something you handle immediately.  All of the embarrassment and shame were caused by her actions.  I would let her know that now she has to build your trust up again because you will not be taking her to the store or shopping again for a while.  She needs quite the grounding for this.", "NTA. She is lucky you saw her and not security. She would have gotten in real trouble.", "NTA\n\nShe was doing wrong, and got caught, so she faced the consequences.", "NTA, and great work on this one right in the moment!! Your daughter will be better off without those type of friends.  Especially at a very young and vulnerable age.", "NTA. You did good!  Don\u2019t think I\u2019d let her go shopping without you for awhile tho.", "She ruined her birthday by stealing. Does she seriously thinks it\u2019s acceptable to do that? And then also get mad at you!? Wow", "Better to be embarrassed at 13 than in jail at 33! Good job mom!", "Nta, kids need to learn that actions have consequences.", "NTA. I remember when I was around five or six, I was with my mom at a store in the makeup section. I understood what stealing was, but I was a kid who didn\u2019t really get why it was bad. I also knew what lipstick was and that Mommy liked lipstick and I wanted to make Mommy happy. Mommy was not happy when we came home and I gave her a bright pink lipstick I had pocketed (it wasn\u2019t her color, IG?) So she drove me right back down while terrifying me with stories on how I was now a criminal and the police would take me to jail and I\u2019d never leave (I knew what jail was because I watched Cops with grandma). The store manager was laughing when she saw a six year old crying because she thought she was gonna go to prison for stealing a lipstick from Walgreens. But she accepted my apology and told me she wouldn\u2019t call the police on me. She explained why stealing is very wrong and why it\u2019s important to pay for things and that, while I may have just wanted my mom happy, she\u2019d be happier if I did good things like clean my room. My mom paid for the lipstick (I think she wanted me to start feeling better) and got me McDonald\u2019s on the way home. I never stole again. \n\nThe feelings I felt that day stayed with me and, while I laugh about it now (I guess my love of makeup was always with me), I knew it was an embarrassing and scary situation that taught me a valuable lesson. Man, I miss my mom. She was great.", "NTA she ruined her own birthday. \n\nMy parents probably would have taken it a step further and returned the clothes you actually bought her. Probably a little harsh but she is a teenager. \n\nYou were all there and you were obviously willing to spend money on her and her friends so it\u2019s clear she didn\u2019t have to steal.", "NTA\n\nIt's your job as a parent to guide your children and that's exactly what you did. She might hate you in the moment, but in the long run she will be grateful for the lesson :)", "NTA - she has experienced the consequences of her actions. Not your fault.", "NTA it's good that you show her that actions have consequences", "NTA. If she\u2019s dumb enough to steal with you beside her, who knows who else would\u2019ve caught her. It\u2019s a good lesson to learn, albeit an unfortunately tragic event for a 13 year old, but isn\u2019t everything.", "NTA and I am guessing this isn't the first time she steals something", "NTA! Your daughter was already being given lots of new clothes for her birthday, as were her friends. But she decided to shoplift, too. If she didn't want to get called out for stealing, great. DON'T STEAL. That was her choice and she gets to have the consequences of that choice. If her friends don't want to be friends with a thief, maybe they're better kids than you thought. The audacity to be pissed at YOU because she got caught stealing is nuts. She needs some real intervention now, before she gets herself in real trouble.", "NTA\n\nYour daughter though....wow. Such entitlement. I get that she was maybe trying to look cool to her friends, but *stealing*?? You did the right thing and called her out on it. Doing it in front of her friends will have a bigger impact on her (in a good way) than taking her aside to do it quietly. She won't steal again.", "NTA\n\nYou were being her parent rather than her friend. Kudos", "NTA, why the hell would you think YTA here??", "NTA- I stole something at 13. The store caught me and my friend.   My mom was so mad and told them to take me to jail (which they did not). I went and toured juvenile hall, and it was scary.  Never have stolen since. The point is that my mom was not worried about being my friend. She was worried about teaching me a lesson so I could be a successful adult.", "NTA. She ruined her own birthday.", "NTA, brat stole and thought it made her hot shit, a reality check was warranted, and the public shame of your peers is a proportional punishment from thievery. No one likes a thief, and that needs to be taught; if she didn\u2019t want to be ridiculed, should\u2019ve kept her sticky fingers to herself.", "NTA. You acted like a responsible parent.", "NTA.  The problem with many people today is their parents did not do what you did.  Good job, Mom.", "Of course she thinks you shouldn\u2019t have told her off and should of waited she\u2019s embarrassed that she got caught stealing and had to face consequences. 13 is more than old enough to know that stealing is illegal/wrong", "NTA your daughter is a thief! She needs to be outed!", "NTA -Good job Mom! If she loses friends for theft then that's the repercussions of her actions. She's lucky she didn't get caught and ALL of her friends be stopped by an employee and held until their parents and/or the police arrived. Her friends wouldn't be allowed to hangout with her...which is worse?", "NTA and good on you for immediately putting your daughter on the spot. Actions have consequences.\n\n\"Officer, I know I beat up this man but it's my birthday, you see?\" probably wouldn't fly either.", "NTA tell her what she did is called stealing and it's a crime. Better you nip this in the bud now before she continues. Honestly, you need to have a serious conversation with her about why she's doing this before she lands herself and you in trouble.\n\nAlso tell her that whats more embarrassing is being arrested for theft so she got a lucky break.", "NTA.  Perfect response and if it causes her to lose the friends you don't like all the better.\n\nMy guess is she'll think twice about shop lifting in the future.", "NTA. You are her parent, not her friend. You\u2019re job is to raise a good, productive member of society. If she loses friends that sucks for her but they were never her friends to begin with. Over the next 6 years you are not going to be a popular person. She will hate you, rage at you, want you to go away. But eventually she won\u2019t be a teenager anymore. Keep the course momma. You did the right thing.", "NTA. She did it. She might face the consequences.", "NTA. You don\u2019t have to accommodate her for something she did out there in public. Everyone knowing about it is just a simple consequence and she has to learn how to deal with it.", "NTA \n\nGood mom, 13 is way old enough to learn FAFO. Maybe she'll think twice next time", "NTA.  Now she'll really think twice about being a thief.", "NTA, you handled this perfectly to teach her a lesson. I hope she did learn from this.", "NTA\n\nShe was stealing.", "Nta. She deserved that and more if she's not contrite, and it sounds like she's not.", "NTA. She clearly knows the difference between right and wrong and is now angry at the prospect of suffering the consequences of her own bad decision, birthday notwithstanding. \n\nGood on you for holding her feet to the fire and holding her accountable. She\u2019s learning a lesson about values and appropriate behaviour\u2026 a lesson I hope sticks with her. Her life is not ruined on account of this incident.", "NTA. My brother and his friend had a bad habit of stealing cards and Lego when they were in highschool, and they didn't stop until they were caught and got in trouble. My brother didn't steal a single thing after that point. Shoplifting needs to be nipped in the bud, it's addictive and harmful.", "Nta - she SHOULD lose friends. She's a teenager. She's a thief.

Honestly, I'd consider switching schools or making a big change if this current peer group is problematic.  That is a hard no way.\n\nMiddle school does suck.  Because kids think they need to do stupid crap like this to impress their peers. they all feel crappy about themselves so they lash out to those around them.  That does not remotely make it acceptable behavior.", "NTA Better she learns from you than from the police.", "Your daughter gave you the Captain Philips \"I am the captain now\" treatment when she told you how to parent. \n\nShe ruined her birthday, not you. She may lose friends over this, but if they are the kind of friends who encourage shoplifting and a bad attitude then your daughter will be better off without them.", "NDA and the world would be a much better place if bad behaviour was adressed immediately like you did. She ruined her birthday, you did not ask her to steal.\n\nA thief deserves more punishment than she got. If she loses friends over being so stupid thats a very valuable life lesson. Better at 13 than at 23 or 33.", "Uhm\u2026NTA - but your 13 year old is for writing this trying to get sympathy. Nice try kid, you stole and ruined your own birthday. Don\u2019t steal.", "You did the right thing. Your daughter needs punishment big time.", "NTA - If my daughter who happens to be 12 turning 13 scolded me for ruining her birthday after I caught her stealing from a store, not only would she be embarrassed, but her room would be stripped of any devices for the rest of summer.

Statistically most tweens try shoplifting at some point. I\u2019m just grateful that when my daughter was caught the judge was a compassionate person who told her that one poor choice didn\u2019t have to define who she was. Apparently if Reddit had been the judge they\u2019d have locked away a 13 yr old girl and thrown away the key. The shaming would have been tremendous and who knows if my daughter would have had the strength to redefine herself given how harsh all the redditors are. I thought the new generation didn\u2019t like labels but honestly Reddit makes me rethink that assumption every day.", "nta", "NTA. I would have instantly returned everything you got her. No rewards for being a thief.", "My son was a 7yr. old blubbering mess who picked-up a balloon off the floor. He was also a 7yr. old blubbering mess who handed it back to the store manager and apologized for taking something that didn\u2019t belong to him. The manager assured me that it was fine and I shouldn\u2019t have bothered. The reaction from his two brothers that just watched what their brother went through proved my point. Teachable moments are valuable. Good parents don\u2019t let them go by. Great Job. NTA", "Consequences of her own actions biting her in the rear end. Sucks to suck sometimes. Here\u2019s the thing, you write this like it\u2019s a common issue. How often is she stealing? Because tbh if it\u2019s regularly like it sounds, she\u2019s going to wind up in jail at some point. Discipline your kid before the legal system has to. \n\nNTA but you will be if you allow her to continue stealing and then \u201cscold\u201d her at home later.", "Hell no, your teaching her right from wrong.", "NTA\nShe doesn't get a pass on theft because it's her birthday. She ruined it for herself, and if her friends talk about it, oh well. Welcome to the teen years!", "NTA\n\nHer behavior was the cause of her ruined birthday.  If she had made a different choice, nothing would have happened.  Hopefully she has learned that her actions have consequences.", "NTA. I was your daughter once.  My mom literally peeled me away from my friends and brought me to the police station and told them to hold me (they did not. They told her they are not responsible for parenting children). \n\nI ended up getting charged & banned from the store. had to go to court as a juvie. Was given 80 hrs of community service & a court ordered anti theft class. \n\nMy friends??? Still in my life. I moved out of state so we don\u2019t keep in touch as often but I\u2019ll be seeing one of them in October. Friends either grow out of the rebellious stage or they don\u2019t. Bad friends will drag you down, good friends will lift you up and stand by your side. good friends will stay and not spread rumors. \n\nAlthough it sucks potentially losing friends, if they really were good to her, this wouldn\u2019t end her friendships.

I marched him back and had him return them.  Lol", "NTA - the embarrassment might make the lesson stick", "NTA. Immediate repercussions were warranted.

Hopefully she\u2019ll think twice before ever doing that again.", "NTA. Middle school sucks, I\u2019ve been an 8th grade teacher for 10 years, it\u2019s always shitty, and this behavior tracks.

Lucky the parent saw it first, hopefully she'll learn", "Fuck no, you are in no way, shape, or form the asshole for keeping your kid in line with laws. When you fuck around, you find out. Your daughter fucked around. She found out. Whatever friendships she loses and whatever words are said are on her actions.", "NTA. You parented your child in an appropriate way. Lucky for her you noticed, and not store security. She might have been trying to earn clout with her friends. (She needs new ones!) She should be embarrassed and feel shamed. Maybe it\u2019s time to get her into some kind of therapy and involved with mentoring, so she doesn\u2019t have time or energy for all that.", "NTA. Hopefully, she will learn her lesson because stealing is a great way to ruin her future. As for her friends, if you keep her busy with after-school activities, she won\u2019t have time to spend with them and pick up their bad habits.", "NTA! You have saved her from thinking she can FA without FO. Good parent!! You might consider a bit of punishment though. She made the decision, she doesn't get to whine about paying the consequences.", "NTA. My mom did something similar to me.

She said she sometimes tells girls \"Would you like \\[thing\\] to go with \\[thing\\] you put in your bag?\" lol So funny when they get caught.", "NTA. Sure you *could* have scolded her in private but that would mean letting her getting away with stealing the lipgloss.

You did her a huge favor. Your actions could quite possibly keep her out of prison. She\u2019ll remember this for the rest of her life. Hopefully, she will never do this again.  \n\nAdditionally, I don\u2019t think you would be out of line to impose some additional consequences.

You should probably talk to her about this and tell her that larceny is a crime and has  punishments that are far worse than being gossiped about in school. You actually saved her from being stopped by the store employees and having the police called because of her shoplifting, she probably doesn't see that or care because she's just a kid and still worried about what people think of her and can't see past that but she should be thanking you for what you did.", "NTA.

Notice how the mother throws subtle shade at the girl\u2019s friends, implying that they are influencing her to steal. Overindulging considering she\u2019s taking the girl and her friends shopping. \n\nThe stealing attacked the mother\u2019s values, but the consumerism the mother is promoting isn\u2019t a good value system and ultimately, the mother bares some blame instead of blaming everyone else.

I don\u2019t particularly like her friends, but that\u2019s irrelevant. Anyway, they were having fun. They bought some makeup and and tried on clothes, I bought them a couple outfits each but nothing super expensive. Then I noticed my daughter pocketing a lipgloss. I got really mad (usually I don\u2019t get mad) and I asked her In a pretty loud voice what she was doing. \n\nShe said nothing, and I made her turn out her pockets, and then I made her return it and apologize. A lot of people in the store were watching and so were her friends. Luckily the store people didn\u2019t make it a huge deal and we left. We went home straight away after that, and after we dropped off her friends my daughter was really angry with me. \n\nShe said she ruined her birthday and that she could have scolded me for stealing the lipgloss later, when we were alone. She said it didn\u2019t really matter that much and now her friends would tell everyone, and they\u2019d all look down on her. I remember middle school and how much it sucked. She might lose friends over this. Am I the asshole for not handling it in a quieter way?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "NTA. OP, she stole.

Sometimes that feels like being the asshole, but it's DEFINITELY not the same thing. \n\nMake her write a couple pages on the cumulative effects of theft on businesses. Or the effects of a police record on life outcomes in young people. Or the philosophy behind social contacts and the morality of what we owe each other in the name of common decency. Or the viral nature of behaviors within friend groups.", "NTA. guaranteed she was going to pass it off as really cool with her friends for stealing it. mad that she would even steal when you're buying her stuff?! she just needs to have more or steal for fun?!\n\nI absolutely stole as a child because my parents always said no and literally starved me otherwise. I don't think you're doing the same and you took her out for her birthday. I wonder if she steals more often than you know or if this is a first", "NTA like she made a bed she gets to sleep in it. \nQuestion though - why would she think that stealing is in any way okay?", "NTA. OP, as an additional punishment...might I suggest making her read some of these comments? Especially the top one about her parenting you. Maybe outside voices can make her understand why she was in the wrong. I'm sure you're a great parent, but it can be hard to reason with teenagers.", "Nta, well done, hopefully scared her straight.", "NTA.\n\nMiddle school does indeed suck, but it\u2019ll suck a lot more if she gets into the habit of committing petty crimes in order to maintain her place in the social pecking order.

It\u2019s how she\u2019ll learn where the boundaries are. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t be alarmed just yet, but keep an eye on this friend group of hers. If she\u2019s being pressured to do things she\u2019s uncomfortable with in order to avoid being ostracized, that\u2019s something you need to talk to her about, and not in a sit-down-while-I-talk-at-you way. Communication with your kid needs to be a *conversation*, not a lecture.

Period.\n\nKids find out? Kids are hard on her? YOU didn't do that. She did.  She made a choice to do an action, she learns through lipgloss that making bad choices have long lasting consequences that ripple. \nDon't protect her from her consequences,\nLet her learn that lesson. It's an important one. You make a bad choice, you can't take it back, and the cost is not usually worth it. (Thankfully it's theft of a lipgloss and nothing worse!)\n\nQuiet consequences? Really?

I feel she could have asked and before this incident the answer would have been yes, so there was no need to steal.\n\n2. Attention from her friends. She claims her firends will look down on her for stealing and tell everyone, so either she is guilt tripping you and that is a lie, or it's the truth and your daughter may have compulsive tendencies causing her to steal.

There has been a sustained campaign over the past 20 years or so to obliterate any notion of respect for adults/parents. \n\nIt\u2019s an incredibly damaging message- because actually children feel safe when they have boundaries and understand the rules.

There are special schools in this location for children with these problems where they have one on one learning and teachers who are trained to handle them. This wasn\u2019t one of those schools so the teachers were at a loss. The kids were absolutely wild, never seen anything like it. And nothing could be done because of a teacher even scolded them or put them in time out their parents would be in screaming about adhd and autism. I\u2019m autistic myself and understand the struggle but this was way way too far.

It isn\u2019t your fault at all (I doubt they trained you guys for this) but for a kid with anger management issues, his response was appropriate if really rude in how it was worded.

That kids test boundries because they WANT to know where they are? They do it first is places they feel safe, so they know what do to out in the world.

He\u2019s not the only person whose feelings/safety need consideration. There were younger children under him as he was hanging, should I not say anything and let them get injured if he falls on them? The world doesn\u2019t revolve around him and his anger issues. Do you think a cop is going to respect his \u201cgo away so I don\u2019t yell at you\u201d the second he hits 18? Come on now.\n\nI have trauma informed training. Hell, I have trauma myself that makes it hard for me to always regulate my emotions so I empathize. I didn\u2019t go scream at the kid, but a kid having anger issues isn\u2019t carte blanche for him to do whatever he wants. He still has to be able to participate healthily in society one day and this, \u201cwell he used his words\u201d isn\u2019t doing him any favors.

I tried once because it\u2019s annoying paying for things that you see your friends getting for free- but I had a moral conscience.\n\nIsn\u2019t that what parenting is at least partially about? Instilling a social/moral conscience?

It\u2019s not the norm, however.", "Yeah, he stopped and walked away to cool down. But he still needs to know why what he did was wrong.

My son was allowed to just be out of class half the time at the age of 6 instead of helping him learn appropriate behavior.\n\nHis next school they tried but they didn't have the ability to really discipline or even restrain him when he would try to leave the school.\n\nIt was extremely frustrating because it just means kids can do what they want, especially if they have emotional delays and act out.", "I just really highly, highly doubt the kid was gonna come back to have a discussion about what he did. As it is there\u2019s no mention of him doing so. The teacher in question also should be informed if this is how the child is being taught to deal with things because it is abnormal in most situations for a child and does need to be discussed between the parents and teachers.\n\nEdit: also the child was doing something he wasn\u2019t supposed to be doing. So I\u2019d still be of the opinion that it\u2019s not the best way to deal with things. It wasn\u2019t an argument or discussion where someone needs to cool off before making any judgements. The child was actively participating in an activity that was a danger or disallowed, and when caught he ceased the activity and walked away from the area. \n\nAs an adult, you can not (for example) spray paint someone\u2019s property and when you\u2019re seen, pack your things away and start leaving. That person would definitely follow you and you are not in the right to say \u201cI need to cool down before you confront me about what I just did\u201d"]}
