I also worked at a grocery store in a decent sized shopping plaza which is how I earned my portion of rent and utility money.\u00a0\n\n  \nIn the winter, snow wasn't uncommon, we're talking 2-6 inches. This definitely\u00a0isn't Chicago or New York, and again snow wasn't unmanageable\u00a0most\u00a0of the time. Going a season without much snow isn't odd either to give you an idea. My issue revolves around a blizzard though.\u00a0\n\n  \nThe county wasn't equipped\u00a0to deal with something\u00a0like that and I think we ended up with something like four feet of snow, so cars were not moving at all. As some of you might have guessed it didn't matter to my employer, we stayed open and I had to work. I was able to walk back and forth, so I wasn't that upset, and my shift was during the storm as opposed to trying to walk through the full amount of snow.\u00a0\n\n  \nWhen my shift ended it was dark, freezing, wendy, and low visibility. so I grabbed what I needed for a few days and prepared to walk home. Half way through the parking lot I noticed a woman\u00a0 walking in the same direction. I didn't say anything\u00a0but kept walking. When we got closer to the main road she turned around and asked me not to follow her. I told her I wasn't following her but I was walking in the same direction. I even told her the name of my complex, but she asked me to wait 5-10 minutes so she could get further ahead for safety reasons.\u00a0\n\n  \nI explained that I wasn't waiting there due to obvious reasons but she was free to wait as long as she felt I had put enough distance between us to feel safe. I kept walking and she just stood under a parking lot light. I turned around once when I was much further away and I think she was still there but honestly it was low visibility so I was never sure.\u00a0I did not want her to feel unsafe, but this was an not a normal time and standing out in that wouldn't have been safe for either of us. I didn't want to risk my health because I have different chromosomes.\n\n  \nRecently, I had several of my friends and their partners over before I closed my pool for the season and when I served one of my friends GF a drink she called me a gentleman. One of my friends said \"oh no he is not!\" and told the above story. This did not end up being a little thing to nearly half the group. Most of the women seemed shocked and one even said she couldn't look at me the same. My friend said he was joking and said that he knows I'm a stand up guy. I said I understand safety for women, but when it comes to weather related risks, I'm just as at risk then any other person and if they didn't respect or like me as a person then they could excuse themselves from my home. They called me a thoughtless jerk and left.

Like, if you were a criminal that would be the right way to get robbed or rped.\n\nIt sounds like some sort of power play or weird drama.", "NTA. Honestly, if it were me and I was that nervous I wouldn't have engaged with you at all. \n\nShe could easily have stayed back for even a minute or two till you were far ahead of her. That is the best defensive position to take anyway, so she could keep you in her sights. Instead, she made an unreasonable demand of a total stranger.\n\nShe wasn't afraid of you, she was entitled.", "NTA.\n\n\u201cExcuse me, I know I walk slow, but I need you to walk even slower. I don\u2019t feel safe being passed by a Y chromosome.\u201d\n\nI get that women (unfortunately) need to take extra precautions (it shouldn\u2019t be this way) when out and about, but you find a way to be safe without demanding the world inconvenience itself around you.\n\nLet\u2019s put it this way, if this was on the freeway and a timid driver insisted on going 5 under the speed limit and was too afraid to pass anyone, the logical (and legal) thing to do is get into the right lane, not camp in the passing lane and expect traffic to go no faster than you.", "NTA, and I say this as a woman who thinks men should be aware of their behavior like this and try to be considerate. But asking you to wait in a blizzard so she can feel better, after she\u2019s already made contact with you and you told her where you\u2019re going in the same direction, is totally unreasonable.", "NTA. You did what you could to reassure her that you meant no harm. Asking you to stand in a blizzard so she could get further ahead was ridiculous and entitled. It is up to the individual to see to their own comfort (in this case, putting distance between you) and, as such, she should have chosen to either walk faster or stand still herself instead of even asking you to to do it.", "NTA at all, you didn't dismiss her concerns - you offered to go ahead. It was unreasonable of her to expect **you** to stand around in a blizzard for 10 minutes but refuse to do that herself.", "That was ridiculous. You can just slow down and let the other person walk ahead. I cannot imagine asking someone to stand around and wait. What about other men she encounters on the way home? I have an image of loads of guys standing under streetlights, waiting for permission to walk.  NTA", "NTA.  Find new friends.", "NTA.  I am a woman and I understand the lady in the snow feeling wary; however, you have just as much a right to keep walking as she did in such a life threatening situation.", "Might be unpopular, but NTA. You had no obligation to suffer more time in the storm through no fault of your own. \nThere's a thin line between safety awareness and acting like an entitled a-hole and in my opinion she crossed it.", "NTA. Those were extreme circumstances, and neither of you should have been standing around in the cold.\n\nShe really wanted you walking behind her? I'd rather let the stranger pass and get in my line of sight so I could keep an eye on them!", "NTA and the friend who said she can't look at you the same is so dramatic. You were simply  walking home and explained that to the lady. She was being overly cautious. I would have rather walked part way with a stranger during a snowstorm in case something happened and I needed help.", "NTA, while I understand her apprehensiveness; she was also very presumptuous to automatically assume that you had any morsel of interest in her simply due to the fact that you\u2019re a man and she\u2019s a woman.", "NTA, she\u2019s the one who had a problem so she\u2019s the one who waited", "NTA\n\nHonestly, it could have been a sunny summer day and it still would not make you an AH.", "NTA. You get to walk in any direction you want.", "NTA. This woman felt uncomfortable having you near her on her trek home and your actions to go on ahead should have made her feel more that you were not a threat.  There is no way you could have forced anything on her as she obviously was not open to seeing your presence as a safe harbor.  Likely you walked faster too and could maybe have even helped open the path a bit.  Here in Alaska, we call that breaking the trail which is a harder effort than following.", "NTA. She\u2019s very presumptuous and kinda rude.", "NTA, you respected her boundaries, we're clear about where you were going and suggested an other option for her. I think you did the right thing by respecting your own boundaries too... She had a choice and you had one, you guys both chose right...", "NTA - if the person in question felt that unsafe they could have A: stayed home rather than venturing out in the first place or B: found a buddy to walk with them. Expecting others to roll over and tiptoe around you, especially in adverse weather is simply ludicrous", "NTA- if I was that scared of some rando during a blizzard, I would have waited longer in the store before leaving.", "WTF. \n\n>Most of the women seemed shocked and one even said she couldn't look at me the same.\n\nThey need to get off their pedestals. You were walking home, in which was probably one of the worst storms of the century (if it's the one I'm thinking of). This stranger wants you to wait 5-10 minutes to give her a head start while in a blizzard. Fuck that. And I am a woman. \n\nWhatever issue she has is hers to deal with, not yours. Honestly had it been myself, and you and I were headed in the same direction, I probably would've asked to walk alongside you; it's easy to get turned around in a blizzard. Every year, we hear of stories how someone had gotten turned around and died from exposure a mere 20-30 yards from shelter. No, her safety does not trump yours.\n\nAs far as your friends are concerned, get new ones. If they can't understand that this was a one time event and still have the balls to chastise you for your actions, they're not good friends nor are they very bright. \n\nNTA", "Nta", "NTA\n\nIf she was so scared she could follow your suggestion and choose to stand around in the inclement weather like she wanted you to. \"Safety\" isn't a magic word that suddenly entitles us to demand things from strangers. She is an AH. You are not.", "sounds like you need to find some different friends. fk them", "the stranger was insane and your friends too", "nta, what did she expect when walking around at night, for nobody else to walk too? crazy really. If anything she was more threatening toward you than you were toward her.", "NTA. I am a woman and this sounds crazy to me. If I felt uncomfortable I would have crossed the street or sped up but I would not have confronted you or asked you to stop walking.", "NTA. If she really felt unsafe she'd want you in front of her, not following. \n\nYour friend was a jerk for presenting you in that light. The other person was a jerk for the retro judgement when she's not standing in a blizzard with someone expecting them to stand still for an indefinite amount of time.", "NTA. She felt safe enough to discuss with you if you were following her or not, and to ask you stand in the storm for ten minutes. Quite frankly it's an irrational request to ask anyone to stand under an storm any amount of time. It doesn't have anything to do with you being a gentleman or not to follow such nonsense", "NTA - she didn\u2019t have to keep walking too. A blizzard squashes chivalry here 100%\n\nIf it was dark, in the middle of the night, on a clear street, without intense weather then YWBTA.\n\nBut as a women, I\u2019d prefer you walking in front with low visibility so you don\u2019t sneak up on me \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA, it is not about safety of women, she deserves   the Darwin Award for herself and is clearly an AH for others.", "NTA. Men should be aware and thoughtful that women justifiably feel unsafe around strange men. But you proposed an acceptable alternative. And, quite frankly, I'd prefer to have the strange man in front of me than behind me. If you were dangerous and said you'd wait, why would you actually wait? You'd let her go ahead and then come up behind her. Makes no sense to trust that you'd stay back long enough for her to get out of range.", "INFO: I want to say N T A, but I feel like there's backstory. If my older brother were telling this story, I'd be on his side because I know he's a good man and wouldn't have done anything that he really felt might put a woman in danger. If my younger brother were telling it, I'd get up and leave right along with your friends because my younger brother is an asshole and I am frankly tired of hearing about his feats of douchebaggery disguised as victimization narratives. Your friends' reaction to a pretty innocuous story makes me suspicious that there's more going on here than you've presented.", "YTA for telling your friends they could leave just because they didn\u2019t agree with what you did.", "You don\u2019t have to wait around in a storm, but she\u2019s entitled to ask if she feels unsafe. \n\nCouldn\u2019t you have crossed the street, or sped up and walked ahead of her?\n\nEdit: forgot to add NAH", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
