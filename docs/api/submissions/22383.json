And she creates a triple decker drama sandwich out of it, expecting you to shove it down your son's throat?\n\nI think you need a new, new girlfriend.", "Nta,\n\nIt was clearly a joke, not even a morbid one. She\u2019s just over dramatic and shouldn\u2019t even be daring to propose your discipline your kid for a joke.", "NTA. This wasn't even a morbid or unacceptable joke, and your son is just 7... I am hypersensitive and even I don't get upset over something like this. Your gf probably has some issues with your son or is trying to get out of the relationship and wants to blame it on him, or both (speculating bc I can't see into your lives, she might have just had a bad day or something, but it's still really weird to get upset bc of this).", "That isn't someone I'd choose to have in my kids life. Your kid was simply being a kid and she wants them punished? Naaaaaaah. Firstx who TF is she to tell you how and when to discipline your child? Second, all they're going to do in the long run is make your kid feel like shit. That's a big NOPE from me.\n\nI'd rip the band aid off now and end things since its early in the relationship. This small incident says a TON about them as a person.\n\nNTA", "Nta. Big oofs, if this is how she handles a light and affectionate ribbing from a CHILD, how will she deal with actual concerns that arise?", "NTA all that over candy?", "he's 7.", "OP, she\u2019s already giving off evil stepmother vibes, and it\u2019s only early days! Has she never been around children before? This sort of throwaway comment is par for the course, and in my experience there is a lot more morbid banter where this came from. Kids playing around and saying they will chop each others heads of, followed by maniacal laughter? \n\nAt most, a appropriate response from you might have been \u2018hey buddy, we don\u2019t say that to people. It\u2019s not kind\u2019. \n\nShe sounds like she\u2019s a bit precious, and you should proceed with caution. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. The kid has a sense of humour that your girlfriend doesn\u2019t like. That doesn\u2019t mean he did anything wrong. It\u2019s not a typical sense of humour for a 7 year old but maybe he\u2019s not a typical 7 year old? That\u2019s ok. People all the world have the same sense of humour, you don\u2019t have to teach him that it was wrong, maybe try and teach him the appropriate times and places to make those jokes out loud? As hard as that is and it is hard but it\u2019s a journey that could help him in the long run. He\u2019s on the spectrum so he might not be able to tell naturally and may have to be taught a bit more", "My kids say things that are awkward or rude from a neurological view when they are trying to be affectionate or funny quite often, and it doesn't warrant a punishment. It's part of autism for them. \n\nYour lady does not seem to be the right kind of partner for you or your son if she expects your child's behavior to always be \"polite\" by NT society's standards. She should be okay with knowing he may something that feels odd to an NT person but has no malicious intent. If she has expectations that your parenting and \"discipline\" is to be traditional or fit NT ideas of manners and etiquette, she's only going to make your son feel less than if you continue this relationship. She is not going to accept that it's different for you and him. She is going to expect you to punish your child for every misstep he makes due to not having the same social brain style she does. This kind of person has the philosophy that you need to mold your child into acting NT and hiding their own autism. \n\nYou can do better by your son. Find a woman who already understands parenting gently with autism. I guarantee you that single women with ND kids who are wonderful parents are out there. Imagine how hard it is for them to find a date. You could make each other feel accepted and understood!", "I have this joke stolen from an ex \u201cJohnson\u2019s funeral home, you stab \u2018em, we grab \u2018em\u201d whenever I answer the phone and I\u2019m in my mid 30\u2019s. Might be childish w/e she overreacted NTA", "Maybe she has an eating disorder and this was triggering ? I dont think your kid meant any harm though. NTA", "NTA. But you will be if you don't dump the girlfriend now. Keep crazy people away from your kids.", "You're NTA but your girlfriend might be.\n\nIf he made that joke at 14, I might agree that it's a little inappropriate and you should talk to him about it. But at 7, the joke was mostly harmless and not intentionally malicious.\n\nCan your GF honestly say that she never said something that got blown out of proportion by another party?", "Soft NAH. I'm going to assume she doesn't have any children of her own, and you said she's only met your son a few times. Yes, she overreacted, but I can see where she might be upset by it. Given that you've said she is a sensitive sort and has had a few bad days this week already, it seems likely that she is just taking this way harder than she ought to be. Y'all might do well to talk a bit about how your son jokes/teases people, and the fact that him being comfortable enough to do so with her is actually a good sign.", "NAH. I think I\u2019m missing something here because so far it\u2019s all N T As, but\u2026.this isn\u2019t a \u2018morbid joke about starving\u2019.  I think everyone including you have missed the point of what the girlfriend objected to.\n\nI THINK likely your girlfriend may have been commenting on the fact that your son wasn\u2019t sharing something in terms of manners.   Like, you said he \u2018was sharing with us\u2019 but then you say \u2018when it came time to share with her he \u2018jokingly said no\u2026\u2019.  But then didn\u2019t share.  I think maybe she thought well that\u2019s rude, dad should check that behavior.  Your son didn\u2019t make a morbid joke..he didn\u2019t \u2018share\u2019.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
