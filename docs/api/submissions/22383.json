She should be okay with knowing he may something that feels odd to an NT person but has no malicious intent. If she has expectations that your parenting and \"discipline\" is to be traditional or fit NT ideas of manners and etiquette, she's only going to make your son feel less than if you continue this relationship. She is not going to accept that it's different for you and him. She is going to expect you to punish your child for every misstep he makes due to not having the same social brain style she does. This kind of person has the philosophy that you need to mold your child into acting NT and hiding their own autism. \n\nYou can do better by your son. Find a woman who already understands parenting gently with autism. I guarantee you that single women with ND kids who are wonderful parents are out there.

She set a boundary, and you took it into consideration.", "This!!!", "Seriously, my brother is on the spectrum and nothing shuts him down faster than someone completely overreacting to an innocuous joke. If someone explains why they found it weird he\u2019s totally cool. He doesn\u2019t like making people feel uncomfortable. \n\nThe girlfriend is not the kind of person that can handle being around an ASD kid if she\u2019s gonna freak out whenever the kid acts like this. Or honestly any kid. Kids say weird shit!", "Honestly I don't even see this as a morbid joke but everyone has the right to what they feel. If it was me in that situation I probably would have joked back with a fake and playful gasp saying \"you really want me to starve? I'm wasting away!\". I don't know, it just seems like she made a big deal over nothing unless she has like food problems or something", "Never, ever stay with anyone hoping that they will change with time. It doesn't work and usually results in misery for everyone.", "This was mild joking, not disrespect.\n\n\nI am very strong on children respecting adults, but in this instance the child does not need to impress the adult. The adult should be impressing the child, if she wants to be stepmother material. The child is the priority in this situation.", "It's sarcastic hyperbole, exaggerated teasing - of course girlfriend will not actually starve if she doesn't get to have 1 snack, her ability to survive is not dependant on a 7 year old sharing a snack with her. And it is not a boy/girl thing. It's a silly play thing that OPs son has probably learnt from one of his parents/family members.", "100% I agree. The dad should be protecting his child at every turn from an adult wanting arbitrary obedience. That\u2019s stupid. I\u2019m just saying it\u2019s a good chance for a lesson on reading situations", "YWBTA if you keep this disgustingly manipulative woman around your child. Whatever ass you're getting isn't worth having someone around who wants to power trip on your kid. PUT YOUR CHILD FIRST.", "INFO \n\nHow long was \u201clater\u201d?", "NTA-- I have an ASD son who had similar issues, but is growing into being an amazing adult (albeit a few years later than his peers). Your son is probably going to have issues with making jokes that other people (peers, teachers, your girlfriend) find uncomfortable and inappropriate.  It's going to be a problem. It's going to make social situations difficult for a good long while.  He's going to learn very, very slowly.  But he's going to learn, and it's going to be OK.  \n\nYou are doing absolutely the right, very best thing you should be doing as a father! Don't exaggerate how bad things are, don't punish him for doing and saying things like this. He needs you on his side. Yes, it makes others uncomfortable, but he has to go through this stage in order to learn and grow.  It is *so very* valuable that he has a parent who values him for where he is at, and what he can do rather than putting him down for things he can't do yet.  \n\nIt sounds like you're getting serious with your girlfriend, and if she's going to become a permanent part of your son's life, she's going to need to learn a lot about ASD children's needs and development paths and timelines.  She needs to learn to appreciate when he is doing things to reach out and be more social.  She needs to not feel threatened by him when he's acting in a way that's not neurotypical, because he needs to be surrounded by people who love him for what he is now. If she's as a good of a person as you think she is, she'll be able to learn this, but she's going to need to spend some time learning about ASD, and learning what specifically ASD is like for your son.  Every child is different--I hope she can open her heart and mind to get to know your son well enough to love him for who he is.\n\nYou are doing the best, most amazing things by recognizing this as him learning and experimenting with how to play with humor. That safe space he has with you to be himself and make mistakes where he knows you will love him and not judge him is super valuable.  I realize that our ASD kids take more patience, so your love and support is so important for him to be able to grow into his best self.\n\nSuggestions (things I wish I'd done more of): I think it's really helpful to talk to our ASD kids about how other people act and think about things.  Don't make a big deal out of it, don't jump on the behavior every time you see it, don't feel like you need to do it in the moment (sometimes discussing the next day is better), but do discuss and educate. In this case I'd try explaining that sometimes people don't know if what you're saying is a joke: so when he said that he wasn't going to give her anything, she wasn't sure it was a joke and it made her feel bad.  Then go on to give him a description of what to do instead: if someone doesn't smile and laugh when you make a joke, you can tell them it was a joke, and give them the treat right away. It's sometimes helpful to give ASD kids explicit instructions about social norms: this is hard because it's hard to figure out how to explain the unspoken social norms.  If he's aware of his ASD diagnosis and likes big words, I'd frame this as: sometimes neurotypical people don't get our jokes/think we mean something different from what we really mean (this is how to talk to the aliens that are neurotypical people).\n\nASD is a spectrum, and I know every kid is different, but I'm going to share my/my child's success story--I hope it's helpful for you.  My kid has always been pretty fast at picking up new ideas, but way behind at picking up social cues, and it was hard to make and keep friends.  Things kept going and got more stressful socially (both peers and teachers and in-classroom expectations) until it finally hit a break-down state in middle/high school.  It took a few years past their expected graduation date, and the help of a lot of great caring school counsellors to get a HS diploma, but it happened.  They then spent a couple more years building a friend group online.  I was low-key worrying they would never get their act together, but (fortunately?) I was super busy with my own work (and COVID and everything), and I just kind of kicked the can down the road, and one day they said they wanted to start college--they were ready.  And they just finished their first year in college: great grades, has a summer internship, is going on study abroad--all of those things that I didn't know if they would ever have the bandwidth for, and it's amazing! Anyway, keep encouraging your kiddo.  Keep celebrating his successes, even though they don't look like successes to everyone else, and keep loving him.  He's going to be an awesome human being!\n\nGood luck! I wish you happiness and patience.  You're being a great dad--keep it up!", "ESH. It sounds like she was overreacting, but it also sounds like you didn't react at all. A 7 year old - with or without autism- need to learn what is, and what isn't appropriate.\n\nYou didn't need to 'discipline' him, but hearing someone say 'you need to starve' and not be given the food, might sound a bit hostile. It would be a good teachable moment to explain to him how it might make someone feel,  and it might be good to check if he was actually ok with her being there.", "Girlfriend is trouble. Over reacting and causing trouble between you and your son. Save yourself grief and get rid of her ASAP.", "NTA You handled it fine, I'm thinking that this is a sign that the new GF might not be a good fit for you guys. Even if this was a one off, I'd be paying attention from here on out.", "NTA your reaction seems appropriate.  You were willing to validate her feelings of hurt and you told kid that those sort of jokes aren't appropriate.\n\nHowever, How many people say:  I'm starving on a DAILY BASIS--few people in a developed/industrial country take that to mean they are at risk of malnutrition/death.  It simply means \"I'm Very Hungry.\"  \n\nSo your son said, \"*No, you can be very hungry*\" rather than eat his sweets(which of course he later mitigated by sharing).  \n\nThis is rather like someone who I asked to empty trash(Paid work) and she said No but then also took the bag and explained that's just her humor(I was not really amused but accepted it as not worth fussing about).\n\nSo answer is GF is AH for being Drama Llama.", "Eh...sounds like she is not ready/willing to be around him in any real way.  She may just not be the right one for you and your situation.", "Nah, NTA. But I would be worried, her reaction is way over the top. Please watch out for your kid!", "Lol it was just a joke, people without a good sense of humor belong to the streets.", "NTA im autistic and grew up with a sarcastic ass mother. I imitated that behavior alot and still do. \nHaving an advanced sense of humor around stupidity that you just say in the moment is perfectly fine and actually helps him socialize. If your gf is getting upset over his comment then she may need this explanation.", "NTA.  If he said that to me, I would\u2019ve clutched my stomach and dramatically yelled \u201coh no I\u2019m so hungry I\u2019m gonna die!\u201d Then collapse lol.  But I have a twisted sense of humor so there\u2019s that.  Maybe tell him it\u2019s not a nice thing to say around certain people but he shouldn\u2019t get in trouble over it.", "NTA but this has red flags all over it.", "I've taught 1st grade, 2nd grade, and third grade. Your son made a completely normal joke for a 7 year old. (I love kid humor. It's so dumb.)\n\n\nYour girlfriend's response to the joke is really weird. She had a very big response to a very small problem. \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\n\n\nYou're NTA.", "YTA. Not for not taking her seriously, because she was out of order.

Huckabee in Stripes ,'Lighten  up Francis'", "NTA", "NTA.\n\nWhat a pain in the a*. \u201cNo you have to starve\u201d, \u201cno you can\u2019t drink\u201d, \u201cyes, but it is 100\u20ac for a glass of tap water\u201d are joke that most of the people do between friends.", "NTA she needs to get real lol. I was expecting something horrible. He\u2019s a KID. And on the spectrum (I have 2). She\u2019s gonna have to learn to deal", "YTA, it's bare bones parenting to teach kids not to be rude to guests. And autistic folks often appreciate being told The Rules; we don't automatically pick up on them like most other people. Giving him a heads up that The Rule of guests is to be accommodating would be so loving and helpful. While I would also be taken aback by a child who said such a thing to an adult, I don't think I would bring it up later, but I would definitely be watchful for more lax parenting moments.", "NTA that was not even a mean joke. If he had made it personal like \"she's too fat\" I could see her being upset but it wasn't. Just wait until he gets to the \"I hate you.\" Age.", "NTA. He is 7 and on the spectrum. What is she, 9 and entitled? I can\u2019t imagine a grown woman taking this seriously. And yeah, if she doesn\u2019t \u201cget\u201d kids, this won\u2019t work.", "You are the asshole if you don't break up this woman", "NTA it was a joke", "NTA.\n\nJFC, he's SEVEN.  He is going to make poop and fart jokes and dead baby jokes and \"Yo Mama\" jokes and every other kind of grade-school humor that you can think of, most of which is in poor taste and almost all of which is just silly.\n\nIf she's this much of a princess around him, she is probably not appropriate to be a boy-parent (or quasi-parent) and you may want to think exposing your son to this.\n\nIncidentally, didn't you say he shared with her?  He obviously wasn't serious.\n\nNot an offense.  The most you might need to do is tell him that his joke might have hurt her feelings, and he ought to tell her that he didn't mean it.  Although in my experience, 7 year olds tend to have the memory of a goldfish about stuff like this and he's probably already forgotten.  Bringing it back up may create issues where none exist.", "Honestly, OP would be the AH if you disciplined him. It was obviously a joke that he made in the comfort of his own home and it was not hurtful in any way.

All of the above?", "She tries a lot to get along with him, reads books about autism, takes us to meet her horse because she read autists often connect to horses somewhere.\n\nShe is very very very careful and insecure around him though.
