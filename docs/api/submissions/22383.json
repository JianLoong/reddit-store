She should be okay with knowing he may something that feels odd to an NT person but has no malicious intent. If she has expectations that your parenting and \"discipline\" is to be traditional or fit NT ideas of manners and etiquette, she's only going to make your son feel less than if you continue this relationship. She is not going to accept that it's different for you and him. She is going to expect you to punish your child for every misstep he makes due to not having the same social brain style she does. This kind of person has the philosophy that you need to mold your child into acting NT and hiding their own autism. \n\nYou can do better by your son. Find a woman who already understands parenting gently with autism. I guarantee you that single women with ND kids who are wonderful parents are out there.

Her feelings can be hurt and she's communicated that and you have reacted accordingly and told your child - this should be more than enough. \n\nI do wonder, if this is how she reacts about a wee joke what she would be like about something that is a lot bigger? Like, does she expect your son to change and stop being who he is in his own home? \n\nNTA but your girlfriend is being a drama queen.", "In my opinion, NAH. She set a boundary, and you took it into consideration.", "This!!!", "Seriously, my brother is on the spectrum and nothing shuts him down faster than someone completely overreacting to an innocuous joke. If someone explains why they found it weird he\u2019s totally cool. He doesn\u2019t like making people feel uncomfortable. \n\nThe girlfriend is not the kind of person that can handle being around an ADS kid if she\u2019s gonna freak out whenever the kid acts like this. Or honestly any kid. Kids say weird shit!", "Honestly I don't even see this as a morbid joke but everyone has the right to what they feel. If it was me in that situation I probably would have joked back with a fake and playful gasp saying \"you really want me to starve? I'm wasting away!\". I don't know, it just seems like she made a big deal over nothing unless she has like food problems or something", "Never, ever stay with anyone hoping that they will change with time. It doesn't work and usually results in misery for everyone.", "This was mild joking, not disrespect.\n\n\nI am very strong on children respecting adults, but in this instance the child does not need to impress the adult. The adult should be impressing the child, if she wants to be stepmother material. The child is the priority in this situation.", "It's sarcastic hyperbole, exaggerated teasing - of course girlfriend will not actually starve if she doesn't get to have 1 snack, her ability to survive is not dependant on a 7 year old sharing a snack with her. And it is not a boy/girl thing. It's a silly play thing that OPs son has probably learnt from one of his parents/family members.", "100% I agree. The dad should be protecting his child at every turn from an adult wanting arbitrary obedience. That\u2019s stupid. I\u2019m just saying it\u2019s a good chance for a lesson on reading situations", "YWBTA if you keep this disgustingly manipulative woman around your child. Whatever ass you're getting isn't worth having someone around who wants to power trip on your kid. PUT YOUR CHILD FIRST."]}
