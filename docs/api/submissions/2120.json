It\u2019s a weekend thing, we stay Friday night through Sunday morning \n\nSo Saturday night, our last night at the casino, I\u2019m down $200 because my friends don\u2019t let me stop gambling until they\u2019re ready to stop gambling. I just want to lock my wallet in a safe at this point and leave the casino but we\u2019ve got this dinner at a fancy restaurant booked and then reservations at a nightclub VIP thing after. I just got the side salad and a water at dinner because I can\u2019t afford any of this. Then we go to the night club and I just get water again. My friend says \u201cwhy are you getting water here?\u201d I say I\u2019m just gonna stay on the cheap for the rest of the night because money is tight now. He says \u201chey don\u2019t worry about it\u201d. I say \u201creally?\u201d And he says again \u201cYeah, don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d\n\nI assume this phrase, when said in this context, means \u201cI\u2019m buying your next drink\u201d. So I order my favorite cocktail, tell the bartender to put it on my friend\u2019s tab, and go back to the dance floor. When the end of the night came and we were closing out our tabs, my one drink was on my friend\u2019s tab. He told the bartender there was a mistake because he didn\u2019t order that. I reminded him that he said he was buying it for me. He said \u201cI never said that. I just told you not to worry about it. Like, we\u2019re on vacation. Life is short. Don\u2019t worry about stuff like that.\u201d\n\nAt this point I\u2019m a little pissed because I would normally never buy that drink at that price given the current situation I\u2019m in. The only reason I didn\u2019t get water or soda was because I thought my friend was offering to paying for it. We got into a small argument there in the bar, but I dropped it because it was his birthday. Days later he\u2019s still joking about it in the group chat like \u201cI can\u2019t believe you thought I was buying your drink\u201d and I keep telling him it\u2019s a dick move to say what he said without realizing that most people mean that phrase to mean they\u2019re paying for it. My friend group is weirdly split, people who knew about it that night seem to side with me but people who found out later on are siding with my friend and saying I shouldn\u2019t be putting drinks on other people\u2019s tabs unless I\u2019m 100% they\u2019re OK with that. AITA?\n\nEdit: Getting a lot of questions about the \u201cmy friends don\u2019t let me stop gambling until they\u2019re ready to stop gambling\u201d kind so I thought I\u2019d add on to that part. We were there from Friday night until Sunday morning and the plan was to play blackjack and games like that most of the time we were there. Within a couple hours of showing up, I\u2019m UP about $100 from when I walked in and I was content with that because it would\u2019ve paid for my split of the hotel room. My friends then all started giving me shit for cashing out so early. The comment that got me was from a different friend was \u201cWhy would you even come on a casino weekend if you\u2019re going to stop playing on the first night? What are you even going to do for the next two days?\u201d and everyone seemed to agree with that statement so I went and got more chips to avoid bringing people down at what is supposed to be a celebration", "created_utc": 1668264160, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yt8wo0/aita_for_assuming_dont_worry_about_it_means_you/", "score": 5596, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I didn't always take them up on it, but sometimes I did. And when it was my turn to plan something I would pick something reasonable or just have them over to my house to cook and hang out.

If you have two six-sided dice, there are 36 possible combinations (6 x 6 = 36) and to get boxcars (two sixes) there is only one combination that works, which is a six showing on each die. The natural odds, then, are 36 to 1. But look at the center of any craps table (we call those the sucker bets) and check out the payout for boxcars. At our casino, it was 30 to 1.
