It\u2019s a weekend thing, we stay Friday night through Sunday morning \n\nSo Saturday night, our last night at the casino, I\u2019m down $200 because my friends don\u2019t let me stop gambling until they\u2019re ready to stop gambling. I just want to lock my wallet in a safe at this point and leave the casino but we\u2019ve got this dinner at a fancy restaurant booked and then reservations at a nightclub VIP thing after. I just got the side salad and a water at dinner because I can\u2019t afford any of this. Then we go to the night club and I just get water again. My friend says \u201cwhy are you getting water here?\u201d I say I\u2019m just gonna stay on the cheap for the rest of the night because money is tight now. He says \u201chey don\u2019t worry about it\u201d. I say \u201creally?\u201d And he says again \u201cYeah, don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d\n\nI assume this phrase, when said in this context, means \u201cI\u2019m buying your next drink\u201d. So I order my favorite cocktail, tell the bartender to put it on my friend\u2019s tab, and go back to the dance floor. When the end of the night came and we were closing out our tabs, my one drink was on my friend\u2019s tab. He told the bartender there was a mistake because he didn\u2019t order that. I reminded him that he said he was buying it for me. He said \u201cI never said that. I just told you not to worry about it. Like, we\u2019re on vacation. Life is short. Don\u2019t worry about stuff like that.\u201d\n\nAt this point I\u2019m a little pissed because I would normally never buy that drink at that price given the current situation I\u2019m in. The only reason I didn\u2019t get water or soda was because I thought my friend was offering to paying for it. We got into a small argument there in the bar, but I dropped it because it was his birthday. Days later he\u2019s still joking about it in the group chat like \u201cI can\u2019t believe you thought I was buying your drink\u201d and I keep telling him it\u2019s a dick move to say what he said without realizing that most people mean that phrase to mean they\u2019re paying for it. My friend group is weirdly split, people who knew about it that night seem to side with me but people who found out later on are siding with my friend and saying I shouldn\u2019t be putting drinks on other people\u2019s tabs unless I\u2019m 100% they\u2019re OK with that. AITA?\n\nEdit: Getting a lot of questions about the \u201cmy friends don\u2019t let me stop gambling until they\u2019re ready to stop gambling\u201d kind so I thought I\u2019d add on to that part. We were there from Friday night until Sunday morning and the plan was to play blackjack and games like that most of the time we were there. Within a couple hours of showing up, I\u2019m UP about $100 from when I walked in and I was content with that because it would\u2019ve paid for my split of the hotel room. My friends then all started giving me shit for cashing out so early. The comment that got me was from a different friend was \u201cWhy would you even come on a casino weekend if you\u2019re going to stop playing on the first night? What are you even going to do for the next two days?\u201d and everyone seemed to agree with that statement so I went and got more chips to avoid bringing people down at what is supposed to be a celebration", "created_utc": 1668264160, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yt8wo0/aita_for_assuming_dont_worry_about_it_means_you/", "score": 162, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your a grown man and need to learn to make your own decisions free from the opinions or pressure of others.

They don't pay your bills, and they don't pay for your drinks, clearly.", "Nta but honey please get some new friends. They completely pressured you and then belittled your feelings of content to make it seem like you were doing something wrong. Also it seems very almost villain like what your friend did - its very hard to believe that they are that social and drink but dont know that \u201cdont worry about it\u201d means \u201con me\u201d and if they did know that then its extremely toxic of them to then say they werent paying and essentially coerced (form of force) you (again just like casino) into spending money. Im so confused by their actions there and op id be weary if you continue your friendship with this group. But as others have noted: you have to have your identity secure and dont let others bend it to their wants- its only yours.", "ESH. I can see why you thought your friend meant he would get you a drink but if you don\u2019t feel comfortable paying for said drink with your own money, why would you order something so expensive with your friend\u2019s money?

I just got the vibe everyone thought I was being a downer. I was UP about $100 within a couple of hours of arriving about the casino and I was fine to stop there since that would\u2019ve paid for my share of the the hotel room we were all splitting. But my friends made it a point that they came here to gamble and it was going to be really boring for me if I stopped playing so early into the trip", "Agreed.

I'd take it as it was intended, more literally, meaning don't stress, relax enjoy yourself more.", "It's fair to say that his language was unclear, but unless that person then flagged down a server and said, \"Put her next drink on my tab,\" I would assume that my drinks were my responsibility.\n\nOP: YTA for putting it on his tab without being explicitly directed to do so.", "False. I do not see it as the friend offering to cover his drink. He's telling him to not worry about drinking water. The friend never said \"I'll buy your drink\" point blank.

He didn't even say \"I got you\".", "Not true", "i go sit in the sports book and watch away.", "I thought it was a common curiosity rule that you never buy food/drink more expensive than the person offering to buy. Which I don't think the friend was offering.", "This is not how I read that statement I read it as op was ordering water because they couldn\u2019t afford a drink. They thought their friend was offering to pay for a drink so they ordered one. They wouldn\u2019t have ordered a drink at all because they couldn\u2019t afford on in their current situation. This does not mean that they were taking advantage of their friend\u2019s perceived kindness or that they ordered something super expensive just that it was more than they could afford given what they could afford was nothing.  \nThey said \u201cI would never buy that drink at that price GIVEN THE SITUATION IM IN\u201d this is not the same as saying I ordered the most expensive thing on the menu because someone else was paying. It\u2019s their favorite cocktail clearly they are usually willing to pay for it, it\u2019s just a higher price at this place and they just lost a lot of money.\nWhat would the point be of their friend offering to buy their drink if she only drank what she could afford when what she could afford was water. The implication in this situation is that your friend wants you to be able to order a drink that costs money and join in.

I don\u2019t think it made a difference in the end result but I can see how I\u2019m an asshole for that part. \n\nAs for the peer pressure stuff, the dynamic of this friend group is one where if I push back against pressure like this they will just stop inviting me to stuff. I guess I let them pressure me because I don\u2019t want to lose them as long time friends but I honestly don\u2019t enjoy hanging out with them much anymore. I agree that I shouldn\u2019t be in a casino, but that was the only event of the weekend. It wasn\u2019t like casino one night and something else another night.

I shouldn\u2019t have pushed the envelope that much", "That part stuck out to me too, as well as the part where OP purposely orders a very expensive drink that they normally wouldn't buy for themselves when they thought their friend was picking up the tab.

Gambling is legal in our state, there\u2019s a small casino about one hour and 45 minutes away from where I live so this was just a drive to another county and a hotel plus food and drinks and whatever.

Also I would not have thought he meant that for a second given the timing of what he said.\n\nHe had just given OP crap for just drinking water, and he said don\u2019t worry about it right after OP expressed discomfort over his financial situation. I think it makes sense for OP to assume the best of his friend (that his friend meant he was covering OP\u2019s drink so just have fun). What he actually meant (don\u2019t worry about your financial situation OP, just let loose!) is a very AH thing to say.
