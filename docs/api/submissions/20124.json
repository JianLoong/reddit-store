I see people giving you shit for getting mad, and yeah maybe throwing money at her wasn't classy, but I'd NEVER treat a friend's vehicle like that much less expect them to pay for a trip I was fully capable of paying for on my own. Did she even suggest that she'd pay you back or anything?", "NTA. My car is a royal mess but I'd still be pissed if a friend was using my seats to wipe their hands or spilling soda without a care. It's called basic respect.", "NTA but I would've just taken her back home and continued the trip without her. She seems like a brat", "NTA. She changed plans to not pay and its simple, your car, your rules. She wasnt respecting your rules so she got the boot. You were at least nive enough to give her some cash to get a taxi or a ride home", "OP she treated you like an Uber and you treated her like an Uber passenger.  She refused to pay you, made a mess of the car and ignored the rules, and you promptly kicked her out because she deserved it since she disrespected the driver whose car she was a passenger in.  If she was an actual close friend then you wouldn't have made this post on AITA in the first place.  Next time get your money up front for any future trips with anyone else because it's obvious she had things planned out ahead of time and thought she could get away with being a user.", "NTA. Your friend didn\u2019t hold up any part of the plan you had, she didn\u2019t provide transportation or any of the trip essentials and then completely disregarded your requests when it came to your vehicle.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She has no respect for you and your property.  If she did, she wouldn\u2019t have \u201cforgot\u201d her wallet and would have stopped being a slob when you politely asked her to.", "Nta. She\u2019s a pig. Up to you if you want to be friends with a pig", "ESH \n\nShould have just turned around if it bothered you that much.", "NTA for kicking her out you did give her money to pay for a cab however yes the ah for throwing the money when she refused to take it you could have just put it down or something.", "Depends on where you dropped her. If you left her on the side of a highway I would say ESH. Personally, I would have pulled off to the nearest rest stop.", "NTA. Not a friend", "NTA, Sounds like a relationship ender to me. You guys scheduled and planned a trip and she 'forgot' to bring money? I would have ended the trip right there. Venmo her for the cleaning costs, if she doesn't pay consider the friendship over.\n\nEdit : Wait, was she riding in the back of your van?!", "NTA.  She doesn\u2019t respect you at all.

All I can remember is I left her at a block with restaurants and such", "How far from home did you leave her?", "That's deeply concerning, since normally people who care about their friends are kinder to them than they are to strangers. Why have you been \"good friends\" with this person for so long again?", "My mother lost her bf of 20+ years when they went on a road trip together for the first time.  It destroyed their friendship and they never spoke to each other again when they got back.  It happens.", "NTA regardless but I'm curious why she was sitting in the backseat? If I'm driving, I expect the other person to be a copilot. They help navigate, watch the road, get me snacks, scan the radio, etc., and I do the same when they're driving. Only exception is if we're driving through the night and the other person needs to sleep to be able to drive.", "While I recognize this is a far distance (by car) roughly thirteen minutes. Oh dang, I'm just now realizing I probably should've dropped her off independently like some other people are saying \ud83d\ude2c", "We've known each other for a while, but as our relationship progressed, she kinda just developed this personality. It's been roughly 3 years since I've known her, so I'm barely clinging on", "Meh. 13 minutes isn't the worst. Probably could have dropped her off though. \n\nIt's astounding to me that all of this happened in 13 minutes. I'd assumed you were at least in the next town over.", "We did have to stop for the materials, and the scenario escalated maybe 5 minutes after we'd picked the supplies up"]}
