Talk about being indignant for something completely unrelated to her even if she was a hairdresser. Tell her it's your body and your choice and she needs to back the ef off. Did she even think your hair looked bad before you said you did it yourself? Or did she mistake it for professional work and then got elitist about it?", "Ooooh, NTA. Pretty bold to hit you with this after just meeting you. It\u2019s your head, and your hair. I don\u2019t care if she was the dean of a cosmetology school trying to force her views on you. No means no.", "NTA. She thinks you\u2019re taking money out of hairdresser\u2019s pockets, but it\u2019s *your* hair. Are you supposed to throw away your emery boards next so that professional manicurists can tend to your nails?", "NTA. She is one for acting like that. Many people do their own hair. People have been doing it forever. She was trying to poach you from your hairdresser but it backfired on her so she got angry.", "NTA. If you had been going on about how cosmetology was a joke and you could learn everything you needed from YouTube, then I could see why she would be mad. But you just said that you did yours yourself and were willing to accept the consequences if it went wrong, and that's not her business. Are we no longer allowed to do anything ourselves if there's someone we could pay to do it instead?", "NTA I started cutting and coloring my own hair when the salons shut down in 2020. It\u2019s a great way to save money. It would cost her nothing to mind her own business.", "NTA.   People can do whatever  they want with their hair.", "NTA.  She sounds annoying.", "NTA You are allowed to dye your own hair yourself. A hairdresser doesn't have to like it, and surely has good reasons, but she must not force you to go to a hairdresser.", "NTA- My actual sister is a very very good hairstylist, she specializes in doing blonde hair dyes/bleaches whatever it's called when you go blonde lol and while she wouldn't suggest it, I've never heard her treat anyone like that, she also doesn't suggest box dyes but she doesn't shit on people for doing their own thing especially when they are happy with it. That's not how to get clients.", "NTA. She needed to back off.", "NTA \n\nBut your brother's GF is definitely the insecure AH.\n\nI'm a guy. I've been cutting my own hair since I was around 25. I'm 64 now. Doing my own hair with mirrors and a clipper and scissors wasn't easy at first, but since I always got a crappy haircut when I went to a salon, I decided (with trial and error, of course) to do my own. After about a year, I got pretty good at it and I have gotten compliments on my hair over the years. People ask who cuts it and try to get my stylist's number, etc., most don't believe that I am the one that does it. I've also cut other people's hair for years, both male and female, for free. Full cuts, trims, etc. \n\nHowever, every time I'd run into someone that does hair for a living, the same scenario as what you went through happens. First they give compliments and ask who does my hair and by the end of the conversation they get snippy (telling me it doesn't look good) and angry because they can't handle the fact that some people figure it out on their own.", "NTA. She sounds like a GREAT party guest.", "NTA. Explain it to her like this: Lots of people cook for themselves despite not being professional chefs. They can go out to eat at a nice restaurant, but they are also perfectly happy making their own meals. They aren\u2019t devaluing the work of chefs, but not everyone wants to go to a professional for every service. Sure, the food may be burned or under/overcooked, but if the person is ok with the occasion mishap, there's no need to stop experimenting and doing it themselves.", "NTA, she wants to do your hair for a premium price and high tip.", "She may be a professional but it sounds like all the bleach fumes have fried her brain a lil bit. \n\nYou wear your hair however makes you happy, and she needs to mind her own beeswax. \n\nNTA.", "NTA.

I had said in another reply (that I think got deleted) but when I first started going down the rabbit hole on trying to get some tips and tricks to do my own hair, I had stumbled across a few subreddits where other stylists had this same opinion. I brushed it off at the time but then this came up \"in real life\" so I guess I just wanted a reality check.", "I guess not. I do know a lot of hair salons and stylists were really hit hard from the last couple years but it's not like me not going was going to make or break her business.", "Yes like not everyone loves going to salons or even shelling out the dough. I cut my own hair. It's now buzzed because of chemo. I did that myself too \ud83d\ude02 that lady sounds a bit unhinged for being so upset over something as ridiculous as someones preference to not go to a salon. She's got some issues!!", "It is a money saver for sure! That wasn't why I originally started but I looked out of curiosity at prices recently and it would probably cost me a couple hundred dollars to go to a salon. Eeek. Not that it's not worth it but I guess I'm just pleased with what I have going at home.", "I\u2019ve been using a box dye for 30 years. But I have dishwater blond hair and a skin tone that makes red hair reasonable.\n\nI also don\u2019t care if people realize I dye, but I\u2019ve had hairdressers at least pretend to be surprised my hair is dyed.\n\nFrankly so many people dye these days that I think all that matters is if the end result is what the individual wants. It\u2019s no longer a social requirement that no one realize you dye.", "She may be *licensed* but she sure doesn't act like a professional", "When I was initially going through and looking at how to do my own hair, I actually came across a couple subreddits where I saw stylists with these same views.

I followed his instructions down to the products (will never use anything but BlondeMe powder + developer ever again) and have damn near perfect results! I get complements on my hair color / health every time I go out and always share the dye name and the video I followed.\n\nTBH she's probably insecure about how well it turned out and / or wanted to poach you as a client.", "If you think of it that way there's tonnes of service vendors in the world i could technically go to support the business but where does that end... Lol.", "As long as the owner of the hair is happy fuck everyone else lol if my sister didn't do my hair at cost plus whatever I feel like tipping her I'd still be doing it myself. I'm not a blonde though and wouldn't even attempt to go blonde on my own since my hair is dark but I love doing a red on my dark hair, it does last longer when she does it but I was always happy with it when I did it myself..", ">So I (28F) have been dying my own hair for about ten years.\n\n>I did a lot of research and through a lot of trial and error, I have been thrilled with the results I have.\n\nSo you've been practicing for 10 years and did lots of research but she still considers you absolutely untrained?

And not everybody could just do hair. \n\nHow does she think OP reached the results she likes? By some divine  hair goddess just sprinkling the results in her hair? \nIt took, oh gasp, practice. \n\nI've gone to high-end places with all their certificates, etc, hanging on the wall and left with such bad results.\nSo all that \"practice and education\" isn't equal being good.", "I bleached my own from dark brown (and grey) kept that for a bit. Then dyed it dark red (to fill the hair) before going back brown. I\u2019ll go to the salon to get it blonde from brown (when my grey gets worse) because it was a pita and I spread 3 bleaches out over months (I rocked chicken tikka coloured hair for a while) and I\u2019m too impatient to do that again. I\u2019d rather pay and get it done much quicker!"]}
