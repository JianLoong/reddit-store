Talk about being indignant for something completely unrelated to her even if she was a hairdresser. Tell her it's your body and your choice and she needs to back the ef off. Did she even think your hair looked bad before you said you did it yourself? Or did she mistake it for professional work and then got elitist about it?", "Ooooh, NTA. Pretty bold to hit you with this after just meeting you. It\u2019s your head, and your hair. I don\u2019t care if she was the dean of a cosmetology school trying to force her views on you. No means no.", "NTA. She thinks you\u2019re taking money out of hairdresser\u2019s pockets, but it\u2019s *your* hair. Are you supposed to throw away your emery boards next so that professional manicurists can tend to your nails?", "NTA. She is one for acting like that. Many people do their own hair. People have been doing it forever. She was trying to poach you from your hairdresser but it backfired on her so she got angry.", "NTA. If you had been going on about how cosmetology was a joke and you could learn everything you needed from YouTube, then I could see why she would be mad. But you just said that you did yours yourself and were willing to accept the consequences if it went wrong, and that's not her business. Are we no longer allowed to do anything ourselves if there's someone we could pay to do it instead?", "NTA I started cutting and coloring my own hair when the salons shut down in 2020. It\u2019s a great way to save money. It would cost her nothing to mind her own business.", "NTA.   People can do whatever  they want with their hair.", "NTA.  She sounds annoying.", "NTA You are allowed to dye your own hair yourself. A hairdresser doesn't have to like it, and surely has good reasons, but she must not force you to go to a hairdresser.", "NTA- My actual sister is a very very good hairstylist, she specializes in doing blonde hair dyes/bleaches whatever it's called when you go blonde lol and while she wouldn't suggest it, I've never heard her treat anyone like that, she also doesn't suggest box dyes but she doesn't shit on people for doing their own thing especially when they are happy with it. That's not how to get clients.", "NTA. She needed to back off.", "NTA \n\nBut your brother's GF is definitely the insecure AH.\n\nI'm a guy. I've been cutting my own hair since I was around 25. I'm 64 now. Doing my own hair with mirrors and a clipper and scissors wasn't easy at first, but since I always got a crappy haircut when I went to a salon, I decided (with trial and error, of course) to do my own. After about a year, I got pretty good at it and I have gotten compliments on my hair over the years. People ask who cuts it and try to get my stylist's number, etc., most don't believe that I am the one that does it. I've also cut other people's hair for years, both male and female, for free. Full cuts, trims, etc. \n\nHowever, every time I'd run into someone that does hair for a living, the same scenario as what you went through happens. First they give compliments and ask who does my hair and by the end of the conversation they get snippy (telling me it doesn't look good) and angry because they can't handle the fact that some people figure it out on their own.", "NTA. She sounds like a GREAT party guest.", "NTA. Explain it to her like this: Lots of people cook for themselves despite not being professional chefs. They can go out to eat at a nice restaurant, but they are also perfectly happy making their own meals. They aren\u2019t devaluing the work of chefs, but not everyone wants to go to a professional for every service. Sure, the food may be burned or under/overcooked, but if the person is ok with the occasion mishap, there's no need to stop experimenting and doing it themselves.", "NTA, she wants to do your hair for a premium price and high tip.", "She may be a professional but it sounds like all the bleach fumes have fried her brain a lil bit. \n\nYou wear your hair however makes you happy, and she needs to mind her own beeswax. \n\nNTA.", "NTA.

I had said in another reply (that I think got deleted) but when I first started going down the rabbit hole on trying to get some tips and tricks to do my own hair, I had stumbled across a few subreddits where other stylists had this same opinion.

I can tone my own hair, multiple times for $30 or less.  I can't justify the cost when it turns out just as well at home.", "Jeeeeze.

She obviously has baggage with people saying stuff like that to her. You haven't said that or thought it. You even indicated that you might damage it which shows you don't consider that you're just as good as a hair dresser. She clearly thought that your hair was done well enough if she thought another stylist did it.

There\u2019s a lot of hate, people who want their hair done to such high end standards, but don\u2019t care if you go homeless in the process. \nI\u2019ve had days in the beginning of my career where I was literally making less than minimum wage after product and overhead. And even then people (who loved their hair and still wanted me to continue doing their hair) complained about \u201covercharging\u201d. \nBut the thing is, ya can\u2019t let it get to you in such a way that you\u2019re offended at people just doing their own hair? That\u2019s ridiculous. I feel like there\u2019s a lot of stylists who\u2019ve taken that attitude and just thrown it right back at people, which doesn\u2019t make sense?

You don't think there is no training, you're not trying to do other people's hair. You haven't been happy with the results from trained people, so you have accepted the risks involved with doing your own hair.", "Some hairstylists go through the training and become convinced that they are now in possession of specialized arcane knowledge that could not possibly be acquired by the layperson.  My last stylist was quite sure he was a fully qualified chemist, to which I (with a ChemE doctorate) smiled politely and nodded and said, \"There's maybe a bit more to it than just your area of specialization.\"\n\nYes, it's easy to screw up bleaching at home and a professional will likely give you better results.  It's also very easy to do the research and avoid or mitigate the possible risks and do a great job yourself.  You're NTA.", "So does that mean you can\u2019t change a lightbulb without being a trained electrician?", "NTA wow, she has a lot of attitude about something that doesn't belong to her. Playing with crazy hair stuff at home is pretty common. Sometimes the only thing you can do in these situations is start what I call agressive active listening. Eg I'm sorry you feel that way, it sounds like this is  happening a lot for you lately, do you feel this undervalues you if someone without training can do something you feel skilled at, are you feeling concerned about the safety precautions involved in using chemicals etc. Put it back on them and remove it from you.", "Lol, nta, her insecurity is not your problem", "Wtf is this comment haha", "Haha that's a very regional thing I feel like. When we were growing up, my parents always sold their house without a realtor but then we moved to a different area of the country and it was very Not Done.", "Hey! Thank you so much for chiming in as a hair stylist. I appreciate the perspective. I totally understand how frustrating it must be to perform a service and then be told they were being overcharged. My best friend is a tattoo artist and I hear that a lot from her. I actually didn't even start doing this at home because of the cost; I was just unhappy with the results I was getting. The money saving is just a bonus.", "I buzzed mine too! I saw so much advice about getting gradually shorter haircuts so you can mentally adjust to losing your hair but I was like, really?
