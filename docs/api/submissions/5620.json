Before I met him, I started a small business which I eventually grew to a point of making a nice income, a really nice one. I\u2019m by no means rich but I\u2019m well off.\n\nMy husband on the other hand makes a minimum wages working at a shop. It never bothered me and we combine our finances.\nUnfortunately, he\u2019s been spending irresponsibly which has become a problem recently but this is not about that.\n\nHe invited his mates for a Christmas breakfast with her her girlfriends/wife and we saw them this morning. All his mates are from his job so earn at a similar level. I didn\u2019t even think about it until it hit me when they started commenting on our house and pointing things out. Some comment of the wives were not so nice (I don\u2019t think I was meant to hear them) such as \u201cI\u2019m showing off\u201d or \u201cit\u2019s too flashy\u201d or \u201cmoney don\u2019t buy you taste\u201d said when looking at my green couch which is perfectly tame and normal.\n\nDuring breakfast, some of his mates had a few drinks. And not even wine, they had some lager and got giddy. Started asking how much things cost, etc. i dodged the questions but my husband has been answering them truthfully. And eventually he told them exactly how much I make. I was furious. I am very private about my finances, not even my mum knows how much exactly I make. And here he is telling people I barely know my financial details.\n\nWhen they left, I blew up at him about that (and the lager I didn\u2019t know he had) served with breakfast and having drunk people over at 11am.\n\nHe\u2019s saying that I\u2019m uptight and should loosen up a hit, thag it\u2019s not a good look and I should stop looking down at them because they work in a supermarket (I\u2019m not). I asked if that\u2019s how he felt and he said that no but they felt that I was showing off with being all dressed up (one of the wives showed up in PJ pants). He started going off and I decided thag I\u2019ve had enough. He was drunk and we wouldn\u2019t have any discussion.\n\nI\u2019m still angry. I told him I\u2019m not going to his mum\u2019s Christmas dinner because k didn\u2019t want to \u201cshow off\u201d and stayed home. He\u2019s still at his moms, absolutely wasted and I\u2019m just getting more and more angry and need a reality check.

Spending irresponsibly when you have combined finances\n2. Letting people insult you inside your own home \n3. Getting drunk by 11 am\n4. Sharing your private information with people you barely know \n5. Ghosting you and running to his mommy\u2019s house \n\nNTA. It\u2019s only been a year, OP; this is going to get worse. Consider your boundaries, and then stick to them\u2026or you\u2019ll eventually start to feel guilty about being YOU. No one should have to deal with that from their life partner. \n\nAlso, FWIW, green couches are awesome.", "So, your husband had all his friends over for Christmas morning and they used it as an opportunity to get drunk, scoff at your house, harshly judge you because of your income and look down on you, then tried to make it seem as if *you* were the one judging *them?* \n\nWhat a lousy group of people. And it seems as if your husband is proving that the old saying is indeed true: *Birds of a feather flock together.* They all behaved terribly and owe you an apology, especially your (jealous?) husband. \n\nNTA.", "INFO does your husband have any aspirations in life besides being a drunk asshole, who looks on while his friends belittle you, and then going to his mother's and getting further shit faced when you understandably stand up for yourself?", "NTA. Though I think you are missing the forest for the trees. Your husband allowed people to disrespect you and your home. Him telling them how much you make was just the cherry on top of his fuckery.", "NTA. I\u2019d start limiting how much access he has to the money you are making.", ">Unfortunately, he\u2019s been spending irresponsibly which has become a problem recently but this is not about that.\n\nYou may think this isn't about that, but it totally *is* about that. No one should be looked down on for their job or how much they make ever. But you can look down on them for being irresponsible and inconsiderate, and for having shitty friends. These are all choices your husband is making, irrespective of his employment. \n\nI dunno what the story is there but judging from his other behavior I'm guessing he's not working that minimum wage job because he made all the right choices and just had a run of bad luck, which can happen to anyone.\n\nJudging by his behavior, he's one step away from quitting that minimum wage job and demanding you support him. This dude and his friends are classless and not in your league.\n\nYou are NTA, but your husband very much is, and that's something you need to think about in terms of your future.", "NTA -- he is.  I would be rethinking marriage, he seems like a jerk.  At least get a post nup", "Ooh boy I was in the same situation. My partner began spending money and talking about things we bought and how much I earned to randoms\u2026ended up getting robbed and every Tom, Dick and Harry tries to borrow money off me. It was his own resentment spilling over as well as a need to claim my success for himself. Get help early", "NTA. But if he is spending so much and your money is a topic amongst friends, to the point they criticize you openly in hour house, you have a huge problem already. Also, the way he was already drunk... yeah, I'd be reconsidering this whole relationship.\n\nDo you have a pre-nup?", "NTA and limit access to the money you are earning if he is spending irresponsibly. I don't understand the E S H here. It is entirely inappropriate to share personal financial information about a person if they don't want it shared. He is totally the AH here and so are his friends. This is not a small matter. I would be appalled if my SO shared information about what I spent, what I made, how much I had saved, etc. It is so inappropriate.", "NTA - he clearly has some major insecurities about not making enough money and he\u2019s being an AH about it. his mates and their wives/girlfriends were speaking out of jealousy and being rude and instead of your husband sticking up for you, he decided to join in on the bully gang. he sounds jealous of the money you make and it\u2019s all coming to light now", "NTA. \n\nEven if your husband is more comfortable talking about your finances with friends, he should still respect your boundaries when you tell him that you aren't. His friends also were being pretty disrespectful from the sounds of it, and he should have stood up for you. \n\nI would challenge you on the assertion that your husband spending irresponsibly has no bearing on this current situation, however. Honestly, it seems like he's developed some entitlement to your money/likes the things it can buy him and a nice dose of insecurity to go along with it.", "NTA. How much money you make is your own business, and it was extremely rude of your husband to just give that info out without your consent. That said, it is Christmas, so maybe the best course of action is just to put it out of your mind for today and have a discussion with him about this after the holidays have died down a bit. This is clearly something that needs to be discussed at some point, though, especially since his poor behavior extends beyond just this.", "NTA people should only ever talk about their money made and no one else's. Money is a privet matter and should only be discussed if wanted. Hell in some rules of etiquette it's one of the topics to avoid when in a party like setting because you could come off bad if someone is overly sensitive about it.", "NTA most things been said already, about the outfit, its actually quite normal to dress a little fancier for a xmas get together\n\nTo show up in pyjama bottoms, now THATS rude \n\nYou have a husband issue, dont let this kind of disrespect in your own home stand", "Runnnnnn NTA", "He\u2019s the AH.  And omg separate your finances now.  Hopefully you have a prenup.", "NTA your finances aren't anyone else's business but yours and your husbands (though I'm starting to think you should leave him out of the loop) he needs to keep his mouth shut about things that don't concern outside people.", "NTA - Ignoring the him overspending. If they were asking how much things cost like a couch, table etc I don't see a big deal with answering that since it can simply be googled however, telling them your personal finances makes him TA. I don't think there is anything wrong with talking about how much people make but it has to be them that makes that choice. I personally don't mind talking about what I make with people doesn't bother me but i would be annoyed if someone talked about what I make to others.", "NTA, however if.he is splurging to much I would move the funds to another account he doesn't have access to. Set up a budget for you both. \n\nPlace the budget money in that account only.\n\nEach person should have their own account for what they get to keep and use, save, etc.. \n\nThis doesn't have to be forever just until you both bring things back in line and under control.\n\nThis works well as I did this with my wife when she got out of control, but eventually we pretty much merged everything back into one account again after a couple years. Although she did keep a separate account on the side she could use for hiding birthday and Christmas gifts with.. \n\nGood luck.", "Nta may be a non issue but I think you should rethink your relation ship and split your finance before he cleans the bank out", "Nta....ur husband is mooching off you and did not even have the curtsy to defend you to his awful friends.....You are entitled to your privacy. You really need to rethink joint finances cause i truly think your husband and his co-workers would try to take advantage of you.... \n\nYou are not a prized pony to show off to ppl. He needs to respect that and apologize big time. This is truly a hill to die on op....", "NTA.  Your husband violated your trust and privacy.  He tolerated and then supported his co-workers\u2019 snarky comments, all of which were mean-spirited, envious, and petty attacks on you.  His attitude and behavior are huge red flags.  This does not bode well for your marriage.", "There are a bunch of bigger issues here to unwrap.  He sees money very differently than you do, and that\u2019s a fundamental issue that often has a negative impact on marriages and relationships. Trying to separate your finances now so that he\u2019s more responsible will lead to damage to the marriage that will be hard to recover from. \n\nA separate issue is the friends and talking about money. You\u2019re not really in line with his friends and there was a misunderstanding about what type of meet up it would be. How they reacted in trying to find out how much money you make, was more on them. \n\nYour husband\u2019s drinking: you brought it up multiple times. It does bother you. It bothers you that it\u2019s his go to when things go wrong. You\u2019re mature enough to not argue when his wasted and that\u2019s good, but you need to evaluate where you are with him.\n\nRegretfully- you have a lot of red flags and you\u2019re downplaying them. Given your husband\u2019s reckless spending, it\u2019ll be on you to fix your finances, every time. It might impact your business and your ability to provide for you as a family. What if you have kids and now you will be the responsible one financially for them too.\n\nYou might have to set your business into a trust of some sort and be careful not to mingle business cash with your household. If you separate, having your finances entangled will be an issue. I know your not there yet, but separating your finances is probably the best idea to protect you and also him from his poor decisions even if you stay together.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Keeping financial details private is a very common and reasonable boundary. I hope you clearly discussed that with him in the past.\n\nIt seems clear that your husband resents the difference in earning power between you. He may claim otherwise but his actions expose his insecurity. He projects that onto you. Also, he allowed his guests to repeatedly disrespect his wife in her own home. This is no small issue. \n\nMaybe a couple's therapist could help you navigate this brewing resentment before it destroys your relationship. But he is treating you, and enabling others to treat you, very poorly. His insecurities are his problem - not your's. Confront him. You deserve that dignity.", "NTA. \nSeparate your finances now, have a joint account for house bills and make sure he has no access to your business accounts.   \n  \nChange any and all passwords to your accounts, remove cards that he has that are tied to them as well.   \n  \nMost importantly, stop sharing financial information with him be the cannot be trusted with private information and let him know as much.   \n  \nIt\u2019s time to CYfinancialA and make sure to talk with your lawyer ias well about the security of your business and if you husband can make any claim of ownership to it.   \n  \nGood luck and ignore his friends, they wear an ugly color of jealousy.", "NTA but keep in mind now that they know how much you earn they'll ask your husband for \"loans\". And he'll probably give it to them to make himself feel important. You should watch your finances just in case.", "YTA for getting mad about that but he sounds like an awful person tbh why does he let his friends talk down on you and assume you're the one looking down on them", "Depends on whether your husband knew you didn't want to share that information.  If he did, NTA.  If he didn't, ESH.  You probably overreacted but that's very gauche either way.", "So how much do you make?", "NTA but I'm not going to a Christmas breakfast/brunch that doesn't have drinks either.", "Alrighty, technically gonna say ESH, but more heavily weighted towards your husband.  He should not have blurted that out.  That\u2019s not information you freely throw around without permission.\n\nBut, blowing up at him every time he does something that upsets you isn\u2019t going to do wonders for your relationship.  I suspect, if you\u2019re husband is a decent person, that talking to him like a grown human being after his friends left and saying it upset you probably would\u2019ve been received better and very much avoided today\u2019s pissing match.  Just sayin.", "ESH. Him and his mates for obvious reasons: being drunk and rude and talking about your finances. You for extending the argument and refusing to visit his mum for Christmas. Do you and she not get along, and you\u2019re using the argument as an excuse to stay away?", "For real - and if it's only been a year, I wonder if OP can get their marriage annulled.", "And he's not only *letting* his friends insult his wife, he is actually encouraging and fueling it. That's the real reason he told them how much money OP makes, if you ask me. He was enjoying his friends berating his wife and this was his way of giving them even more ammo to use against her, passive aggressive AH that he is.", "Exactly what I was going to say!  Definitely NTA.", "This is about money not behavior I think. Don\u2019t think you\u2019re financially compatible.", "OP has every right to get mad, though. Her husband purposely told his friends how much money she makes in order to add more fuel to their insults and judgements so they could continue looking down on her. He's an AH through and through.", "I agree he's AH but I don't think someone's earning should be a top secret and that getting upset over it seems really pointless and dumb", "I understand what you mean, and I don't think it should be a big secret either, but the husband's intentions behind sharing this information with his friends were not good and I think that's the real issue here, if that makes sense. The husband telling his friends about how much his wife makes wasn't just some innocent, passing comment, but rather he purposely did it to keep the insults directed at OP flowing, because he was enjoying his friends ganging up on her and judging her. That's the real reason why OP is so upset.", "I understood it more as he got tipsy by drinking beer and didn't pick up on OP avoiding answering the questions so he answered them", "That could very well be the case, but I guess I\u2019m not willing to give him the benefit of the doubt here because I have a hard time believing he could really be so oblivious. I mean his friends were clearly insulting his wife based solely on how much money she makes and him proceeding to then share that exact amount with them seems pointed and antagonistic towards OP. That was my take, anyway."]}
