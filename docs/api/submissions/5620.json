His friends also were being pretty disrespectful from the sounds of it, and he should have stood up for you. \n\nI would challenge you on the assertion that your husband spending irresponsibly has no bearing on this current situation, however.

How much money you make is your own business, and it was extremely rude of your husband to just give that info out without your consent. That said, it is Christmas, so maybe the best course of action is just to put it out of your mind for today and have a discussion with him about this after the holidays have died down a bit. This is clearly something that needs to be discussed at some point, though, especially since his poor behavior extends beyond just this.", "NTA people should only ever talk about their money made and no one else's.

If they were asking how much things cost like a couch, table etc I don't see a big deal with answering that since it can simply be googled however, telling them your personal finances makes him TA.

This does not bode well for your marriage.", "There are a bunch of bigger issues here to unwrap.  He sees money very differently than you do, and that\u2019s a fundamental issue that often has a negative impact on marriages and relationships. Trying to separate your finances now so that he\u2019s more responsible will lead to damage to the marriage that will be hard to recover from. \n\nA separate issue is the friends and talking about money. You\u2019re not really in line with his friends and there was a misunderstanding about what type of meet up it would be. How they reacted in trying to find out how much money you make, was more on them. \n\nYour husband\u2019s drinking: you brought it up multiple times. It does bother you. It bothers you that it\u2019s his go to when things go wrong. You\u2019re mature enough to not argue when his wasted and that\u2019s good, but you need to evaluate where you are with him.\n\nRegretfully- you have a lot of red flags and you\u2019re downplaying them. Given your husband\u2019s reckless spending, it\u2019ll be on you to fix your finances, every time. It might impact your business and your ability to provide for you as a family. What if you have kids and now you will be the responsible one financially for them too.\n\nYou might have to set your business into a trust of some sort and be careful not to mingle business cash with your household. If you separate, having your finances entangled will be an issue.
