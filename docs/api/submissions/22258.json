I spend my evenings watching things on YouTube, scrolling through my phone, attempting to read a book and end up giving up and going to bed at like 10pm. It\u2019s lonely and sometimes I cry myself to sleep. I asked him if he wanted to watch a movie with me, he said no. I said what about a tv show? No. Do you just wanna cuddle in bed with me for a bit? Sure. Sits there on his phone for a bit and then leaves. So I unplugged the WiFi, told him it wasn\u2019t working (we\u2019ve been having trouble with it recently so it wasn\u2019t too far fetched for it to be disconnecting) and forced him to spend some time with me. \n\nI was talking to my sister about it and she said that I was gaslighting him and I shouldn\u2019t have done that. I should\u2019ve just talked to him about how I feel. But I have spoken to him, it gets better for a day and then goes back to it again. I\u2019m just so so lonely. \n\nIn every other way he\u2019s a great boyfriend, but I just wonder if my life is going to be like this forever. \n\nAnyway AITA for unplugging the WiFi? \n\nTldr; my boyfriend games a lot and when I ask him to spend time with me he makes me feel like he doesn\u2019t want to be there, sits with me for 15 mins and goes back.

You need to sit down and have a very serious heart to heart instead of resorting to deception in order to make him do what you want.\n\nIf you have to force him to spend time with you, is that really a relationship you want to be in? As for his part, he sounds like he's with you right now because it's convenient, not because he actually likes being with you. You need to communicate, even though it might be scary, because otherwise nothing will change.", "This doesn't sound like a viable relationship but in any case I would never make my partner my whole social circle. I'd already be out there signing up for a social sports team, knitting club, pottery class, writing group or any kind of friendly meet up I can find with some people who share an interest with me. Your life and your happiness are your responsibility and if you stay with this partner I don't see how you will be anything but lonely unless you take charge and increase your circle. Good luck.", "ESH\n\nCan you clarify the statement \"In every other way he\u2019s a great boyfriend\" as it doesn't seem he's interacting with you at all?    It sounds as if your cross-country move has left you in a really bad and lonely situation.", "ESH but mostly him. Dump him, good grief. You shouldn't need to do something like lie about the wifi being out so that he will spend time with you.

You can do better. Gentle YTA for the manipulation though.", "ESH - don't gaslight, if you hadn't done that then it'd be NTA.\n\nI completely understand your frustration. My ex-wife would play WoW and watch YouTube videos and eat all day long.  She didn't work, care for the house, or provide me with companionship.  She did gain 100lbs while going on and on about her weight loss, she did dirty every dish in the house every day, she did scream at me for not having enough time after work to do the three loads of dishes she would generate everyday, she did scream at me because the dogs would defecate in the house because she wouldn't get up to let them out.\n\nWhen I filed for divorce she was shocked and refused to move out (I had the house before her and I paid the bills).  She still wouldn't move out so I cut off the Wi-Fi hoping that would free up enough of her time to pack her stuff and leave. It didn't, I eventually had to evict her.\n\nI'm only sharing that with you because I want to stress that I understand your frustration, you're just not going about it the right way.", "ESH\n\nYou for the manipulation, him for disregarding you to the point that you feel the need to manipulate him just to get his attention.\n\nYou need to sit down and have an adult conversation because things are not working out the way they currently are and will not resolve by itself.", "ESH. Youre both handling this terribly. It\u2019s sounds like you just want very different things. Talk to him about how you need more from him and if he won\u2019t do that, then you should break up. You work remotely which makes it very easy to go back to wherever you have a social circle", "You handled it childishly.  Go to him and point blank tell him...he needs to set reasonable hours for gaming or you're out of there.  Go...go and do it now.", "YTA for lying and trying to solve your problems through manipulation.\n\nYou need to address this situation at its roots if you want your relationship to work. What I'm seeing here is a boyfriend who isn't interested in spending time with you for some reason. You need to recognize that if he isn't interested in spending time with you, your relationship is unlikely to survive.\n\nWhen you cuddle, do you talk? Something weird about how you say he \"sits with me\" or is on his phone. Try engaging him in conversation?", "ESH. Your relationship has communication problems. He is being a neglectful partner, but your communication from your end is *also* inadequate and turning off the Wi-Fi is not a solution to that, it\u2019s just a road to a fight about Wi-Fi or him and you alternating turning it off and on. \n\nYou need to sit him down and have a Talk about how this pattern is not working for you and how you need him to be *emotionally present* with you, not just physically present, at least sometimes. If he doesn\u2019t care about your feelings of loneliness enough to adjust his evening habits or think of another solution, this relationship should not continue. \n\nAlso, I\u2019m curious what this relationship is like financially. Who supports who more? Is there a financial incentive for either of you to stay?", "Is the gaming something new?", "Info- what was your relationship like before you moved?", "ESH.\n\nYou shouldn't resort to living to him about the internet, but he should find a balance with you on spending time together.\n\nMe and my wife had a similar problem when we first moved in together. I worked more than her, so when I got home, i just wanted to escape into gaming. So, we set a limit. I would only game when she was not around and when she went to bed before me. We would share our  time in the evenings, and we instituted a date night every week where we do something together that it different than usual.\n\n10 years later, we still hold true to the deal we made with one another. I truly believe that a relationship without empathy and compromise will never last. Find the common ground and make a promise to each other to look at why you both want what you want. It'll work out if you communicate and listen to each other.", "NTA. I really don't see how he could be a \"great boyfriend\" unless your standards are ridiculously low. When he \"sits with you\" for 15 minutes he isn't even \"with\" you, he's with his phone. Would he even notice if you weren't there in the home you share?\n\nYou work remotely so you can work from anywhere. I suggest you take yourself someplace less lonely - take a road trip to visit friends or family. Take yourself to a nice vacation spot out of season so you can get an inexpensive room, etc. Just LEAVE.\n\nYou'll feel better and maybe you two can have a useful conversation by phone after he's thought about things for a while.", "ESH - but for you, you'll stop being an asshole once you dump him or at least put out a solid ultimatum that you will dump him if he doesn't start paying attention to you.\n\nSometimes someone else behaves in a way that leaves no good way of dealing with them - you only have 'Asshole' or 'doormat.'  Here, you asked nicely that he spend time with you, and he refused.  As such, you had no further nice option - just asshole or doormat.  Since you didn't want to be the doormat who accepts a life as a Gaming Widow whose partner never speaks to her, the only other option was Asshole who sabotaged the wifi.\n\nThe only way out is getting away from him.", "INFO\n\nHe has a *gaming* PC but it's not networked over *wired Ethernet*?", "NTA.

That's not gaslighting BTW.  Talk to him\n You two may not be a good match.", "It doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re engaging him. Give him reasons. Set up a date night (more people should do this).

That\u2019s sort of how it sounds by how you describe it.\n\nNTA about turning Wi-Fi off, that\u2019s just funny. But you can\u2019t do that all the time.
