It was my Dad when i arrived 15 mins late at 1.45pm said why didnt you arrive earlier at say 12.30pm\n\nIt was then i said why, i was busy then walking over and i thought i didnt have to be here until 2pm like agreed the previous day", "NTA they sound like total a holes", "NTA. They were the ones who didn\u2019t tell you about the time change.", "NTA, you weren't late, they just don't know how to organise or were willfully causing drama to make them feel important", "NTA, parents should have been clear when they wanted people to arrive.", "I get the sense that lunch was being served at 2, not that you were supposed to arrive at 2. This is pretty standard for meal-oriented gatherings that you arrive earlier to socialise. \nParticularly in this instance where the meal was pushed back to accommodate a late arrival. I expect the late arrival showed up earlier so they got the food started earlier, assuming you would arrive at any minute considering people know to show up before a meal is served as I said earlier. Doesn\u2019t sound like the plans actually changed, that was just your dad\u2019s wording. Soft yta because who shows up to a hosted lunch right when the meal is served?", "Because the meal is just part of the social interaction. Usually, you show up earlier to talk and socialise before you eat. So if someone told me the meal was at 2, I'd assume I should arrive by 12.30 at the latest. So soft YTA.", ".", "NTA\n\n  \nIf it gets to tedious, stop the tradition.", "I arrived at 1.40-1.45pm so felt this was enough time", "The implication of giving a time is that its when youre expected, not 2 hours beforehand\n\nIf OPs parents were adults they would just concede that and give a better time next time instead of being angry about it", "Then you should say to show up at 12:30", "If you\u2019re told \u201carrive around 2\u201d, then that\u2019s what you do and expect the meal to be served 1/2 an hour to an hour later, but if you\u2019re told \u201cthe meal will be served at 2\u201d, you should arrive at least 1/2 an hour before that, and I\u2019d say an hour would be better. \nIt appears rude to show up just for the meal, were you also going to leave right after? In future allow time for socialising beforehand and you will avoid situations like this.", "Yes, they could have been clearer. But OP didn't seem to understand why it was an issue. And I'm pretty sure this is why.", "No i stayed after the meal and all afternoon for socialising", "For what it's worth another family member was told the correct time of 1.30pm and told to arrive anytime after 1pm aslong as they're here before 1.30pm\n\nSo i dont think it was the socialising aspect that bothered them", "Has stuff like this happened before?", "Previously when a meal has been planned for say 2pm they just ask everyone to turn up 15-30 mins before.\n\nSo when they told me 2pm thats what i did, arrived 1.40-1.45pm. They didnt explicitly say \"arrive at x time\" but going on past experience of other family members i knew arriving 15-20 mins before would be ok\n\nOf course if they changed the time without me knowing, i couldnt do much about that", "Ok. But no gaslighting in other contexts? Nothing like that where plans change and you're made to feel like the AH.l?", "No nothing. If plans have changed ive been told so adjusted mine accordingly.\n\nMaybe they assumed i would arrive earlier so the 30 mins time change wasnt an issue and didnt feel the need to tell me"]}
