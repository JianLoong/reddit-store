They only dated for two months, but 2 weeks after they broke up, Dee said she was pregnant with twins. Dee was crazy. She is rude, manipulative, condescending, and lazy, which came out in the 2nd month they were together.\n\nBoth Ty and I grew up in poverty and w/o fathers, so he was adamant in being a good father to his daughters and providing for her. It was to the point that he was giving away half of his paycheck to Dee (about 3k out of his 6k monthly income). He also spent every weekend, a few lunch breaks a week, and various trips with his daughters, all without Dee, who was only interested in him bringing her back food or paying for a trip so she could leave and do her own thing without actually spending time with her kids. \n\nEveryone knows that Ty puts his kids first and is super proud of them. He's the one who takes them to school, helps with homework, Sets up b-day parties, goes to parent/teacher conferences, etc. All without Dee, who couldnt care less.\n\nDee and Ty got into an argument (during my birthday party) about changing the girls' school. Ty wanted to change to a better school out of the Dee's bad neighborhood and Dee wanted them to stay where they were. She argued that she has full custody so it's her decision. He said he takes them to school, goes to p/t conferences, does everything regarding school, etc so it should be his say. She said she's the mom and it's her decision and he said he's the father, so he gets a say too. Then she decided to be petty and dropped the bombshell. That neither child was his. \n\nShe admitted that she cheated on him while they were together and she \"decided\" Ty would be the dad because he made the most money. She even told him to get a paternity test. Turns out she was right. Neither was his. \n\nHe was devastated. He wouldnt talk to anyone for a month. Ty eventually went back to Dee and said that he loved his daughters and wanted to be in their lives anyway. Dee said no, that his \"attitude\" and \"overreaction\" to the news meant she had to do more work with the kids (everything he used to do) and that he was selfish. She threatened to get a restraining order if he tried to see the kids again (i dont think that's how restraining orders work, but he believed her). \n\nThis is where I may be the AH. When he talked to me about what he should do, I told him to at least stop paying child support (which he had not stopped doing yet). That she had been lying to him to steal half of his income for years. He listened and Dee got all shocked pikachu face and went online, blasting him online. She and the kids have to move to a smaller apt, live w/ fewer luxuries, etc. Everyone saw him as a great dad and now they see him as a deadbeat. The girls he loves are also suffering since Dee relies on a minimum wage job (her first ever job). And now Ty's family blames me. They claim that my advice ruined everhthing. I feel like i'm getting more hate than Dee.

This caused the kids he loved to have a worse quality of life and for him to be called a deadbeat by the community. \n\nHad I not told him to stop paying, the kids would be happy and people wouldnt hate him.

It would be hella traumatic to had the only guy they've known as a father ripped away from them.

Sounds like he\u2019s a good guy and if he gets to spend time with the kids and be a part of their lives then he can resume the payments, but he definitely needs this leverage and you were right to give the advice that you did.", "NTA.

Jmfc.", "NTA - You are giving sound advice to your friend who first of all is a Saint, because in this day and age I would encourage always for a paternity test. The fact that this thought never occurred to him shows that he's a good man, but obviously naive and now he's suffering consequences that he could have avoided or at least could have had the chance to make an informed decision. He deserves to keep all of his income and will probably need to use it for himself. He should break up with her and move on.\n\nUnfortunately, he has zero legal rights to these girls, and I think he should take her to court to see if he can sue her for his money or civil suit. (Disclaimer am not a lawyer but perhaps he should see one to see if he has any options at all). He should also see a therapist for himself because this is devastating news. He loved those kids and has been treating them as such, and now he finds out they're not his and he has zero paternal rights.\n\nThe HUGE ASSHOLE is EX GF. She made a cold and calculated decision and kept the truth hidden to benefit herself mostly in all honesty because your friends financial support is what helped her be able to have those girls in the first place, gave ex-gf stability, and his parenting of the girls gives ex-gf time to herself etc. \n\nI really hate hearing stories like these from good decent men losing trust in women in general due to these experiences. \n\nEx-gf is a coward, and the worst part is that two innocent kids will suffer consequences due to her horrible behavior and decisions.", "NTA\n\nI am devastated for your friend.

He should also contact the district attorney and pursue fraud charges criminally by handing all of this evidence to them.\n\nFinally, he should sue to recover every dime. Make it so that, if this thieving harpy wins the lottery, he wins the lottery.\n\nLastly, if he's on the birth certificate, he should consider suing for full custody. If this harpy has her hooks in so deep they lied on a government document (penalty of perjury) then he's legally those kids father. He should call her bluff and end the \"child support\" arrangement by taking custody. She's obviously a small time criminal playing horrible mind games with her children and an unfit parent. Go after her.", "So punish the kids, make them go hungry to win against one's ex.\n\nAlso, your friend will go to jail for not paying, as he should.

If he\u2019s been going to parent-teacher conferences then they are pretty old and have always known him as their dad. He could sue for visitation rights as this is in their best interest. But by not paying child support he looks like he may not care about what is in their best interest.", "NTA - You should also tell him to sue to recover the child support he has already paid.", "I can't tell honestly. \n\nYTA if you told him to stop paying child support without going through the legal process of challenging paternity and having the court throw out his child support order.

He won't be the first man to pay for kids that are not his because they are on the bc, it's past the time to question paternity, or he acted like a dad so he is the dad.", "Nta.

Let everyone know what garbage she is!", "Sad part is, even if his name isn't on the certificate, court might just decide that he has to keep paying because the kids see him as the father and the kids needs come first so he must pay despite not being the father", "That is not wholly true. 1. He is on the birth certificate and 2. Most likely  has in loco parentis rights due to fact one. \n\nHe is on the hook for taking care of those children until a judge says otherwise.", "This wasn't sound advice at all. This is the US, where if you're on the birth certificate, you're the legal father, and can be on the hook for child support even if you aren't.\n\nPlus, Ty was apparently interested in retaining a relationship with his kids, and OPs advice sure didn't help him with that.\n\nThe advice should have been \"Get yourself a  lawyer\".", "sadly paternity fraud is not a punishable crime.", "I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if there was no legal process involved\u2026they were together for like a month, hadn\u2019t been a DNA test - kids probably have her name\u2026", "Are we even sure this child support is court mandated? If it\u2019s not then, no lawyer necessary", "How are you drawing the conclusion that it's bad legal advice? If OP is in the US, Ty has no financial or otherwise obligation to the kids (I realize it is not this way in other countries). Ty didn't even care and wanted to raise the girls anyways but was denied. So he's just supposed to keep forking over cash but isn't even allowed to see the kids he considers his own? And now you're saying OP is an asshole for encouraging him to stand up for himself and not be a damn doormat. That's just crazy. There is nothing \"legally questionable\" about not paying child support for children that are not biologically your own.", "But once paternity is established through the courts he\u2019s not legally on the hook anymore. Acting like a dad because your were deceived into believing you were the dad and actually being the bio dad are two totally different situations. She lied. He paid. Should he have questioned the paternity sooner? Of course. Did he behave like a father and take care of them ? Yes. But he can definitely appeal any child support orders that were put in place.", "Depends, sounds like he was within the statute of limitations in his jurisdiction and is off quick and easy. Thank god for him to be honest, because thats the kind of situation that leads people down some dark paths, shame for the kids but the baby momma got what she was looking for... crazy how little love some moms can have for their kids...", "thats not justice thats infuckingsane", "But even if court would decide to keep him paying child support, this amount to pay will be definitely less than half of his income. So, going to court and asking to reconsider paternity and monetary obligations is the most useful advice.", "Although it's not fair to be on hook, he still can use it to request visitations and custody if he wants. Which means Dee is on hook too, she just cannot refuse him to be a part of kids' life while he has any legal obligations.", "As fucked up as this sounds depending on the state if his name is on the birth certificates it doesnt matter if hes not the biological father they could be still made to pay child support", "It is bad legal advice if OP is not an attorney. OP should have advised him to get an attorney, who would know the law in that jurisdiction. It\u2019s not about OP encouraging him to stand up for himself. It is a legal question. If he\u2019s in a jurisdiction where the name on the birth certificate establishes paternity, then he needs to go through the actions to remove himself. Or if he promised to pay support, in some jurisdictions that could establish paternity. Whatever it is, you clearly are not an attorney or if you are, you are a crappy one. /MonkeyPawWishes is absolutely correct. OP is TA for giving advice that could screw OP\u2019s friend if wrong.", "And this is why people who aren\u2019t legal professionals should give advise around issues like custody and child support. \n\nDo you go to your buddy to ask tax questions or do you take to a professional?", "I am not sure. If he believed he is dad, behaved like a dad and kids believed he is dad, than court might make him to continue paying child support and keep all obligations making kids' interests as a priority. Depends on country, local law and judge. In some countries, if you find out you are not biological dad and kid is already 1 year old - you'll be still legally dad because kid is thinking you are.", "I\u2019ve heard stories of men who had to keep paying child support even though they found out they weren\u2019t the bio dad. He\u2019s not off the hook until a court says he\u2019s off the hook.", "The justice that's sought is to provide for the children. It's not their fault their mother lied.", "I've heard the exact opposite! Even if the name is on the birth certificate, a DNA test would negate that. I thought this was pretty universal in the US, but perhaps it's more state by state than I realize.", "why would he have to pay for children that arent his, especially after a dna test? and she cut him off? madness", "Some courts will make you find the biological dad before making you stop payments and if the dude doesnt know who the other guy is can hold things up and sometimes also take whats best for the child into account  so the fact the dudes been giving the chick 3k a month and doing all the fatherly duties might still put him on the hook but like i said it literally depends on where they live.\n\nEdit: also depending where they live the dude could actually get the mother in trouble for fraud for saying he was the father when he wasnt."]}
