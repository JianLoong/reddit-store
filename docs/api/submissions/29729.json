What would go better for your marriage, respecting your partners (quite frankly valid) wishes in regards to this situation or abiding by someone who is guilt tripping you and using hypothetical children against you's wishes. \n\nYour partner should come first. They are so wrong to try to use you as a pawn.

The step and his father and your parents (I assume since they aren't mentioned) are present and don't need to be represented in this way so it's a ridiculous ask from that perspective too.   \nAnd I suppose if you wanted to offer them a chance to mend the bridge they're breaking you could try to approach the conversation from this perspective next time and see if they'll take the graceful way out of the request.

On his wedding day? You would be massively disrespecting your future husband by saying that you, who are not in his position, with his experiences, know better than him. You are not his guardian, you are his partner. The fact that his \"family\" is disrespecting his feelings shows that everything they portray is filtered through their own wants, their own desire for control. Even if your fianc\u00e9 has not explicitly said \"no\" to you, he wants you to respect *him* and *want what is best for him*, not follow appearances/the judgements of others.\n\nThe aunt is massively off the mark on this one - by inviting the step-mother, you are *already* giving the future in-laws something, as she is not who your fianc\u00e9 wants as family. He likely only invited her so his father attended - a concession. They, however, are knowingly pushing for more and belittling the deceased mother in the process when comparing who you could connect to better. That was an AH move, all part of manipulative and leading language. They put the onus on you to pressure you ... yet it is not your responsibility to build their relationship. They make it sound urgent that you do this lest you make sure that are not in any grandchild's life ... but that does not have to happen, that is up to their behaviour. The future in-laws phrase things to sound as if  you and your partner are the ones causing trouble ... when this is your wedding, they are the ones shoe-horning in and making it about them. All ultimatums are coming from them, to get their way - which is likely a facet to why you partner loathes the step-mother (and possibly father).\n\nIf you want to have a strong relationship with your partner, you do not belittle their feelings, taking the side of the biggest numbers to \"punch down\". You stand with them, keep your eyes open for building up your own opinion then voice it at the right time, in a safe conversation. Under duress, to please others at the expense of your partner, is not the time to be shaky in your support. Focus on him, your loving relationship and how you want to support him in an equivalent way to how you would want to be treated. Respect your partner, respect his mother who is not around to defend her role in her son's life, respect your relationship with him. Who do you want to be happy on your wedding day? Who would you not to make miserable the most?\n\nGood luck, stand your ground and enjoy your wedding! It is a time for congratulations, not manipulations and threats. Have fun the way you and your hubby planned before the in-laws positioned themselves where they are not wanted.

Wow the stepmom is a piece of work. I can see why your fianc\u00e9 doesn\u2019t like her. The Dad is something else too. Them trying to go behind your fianc\u00e9 back and undermine his feelings is also disrespectful. \n\nTo say that they would feel disrespected and your future children will suffer is another level of toxic.

This woman will be in your life in some capacity for likely another 25+ years. You have to decide if this is the hill you want to die on.\n2. Hold out and outright refuse. This is giving this woman MUCH more power and influence than she deserves. It allows your fiance's parents to control your wedding and your future as a family.\n\nI have to go with NTA. I do, however, hope you can find a way to be a kind person. It is pathetic that this woman is jealous of someone who has been dead for more than 20 years. I really get how she wants to be included and to feel special, etc. But this isn't her wedding or her event. My personal vote is to include her in a minimal way and just move on from it.

GoodLuck OP also congratulations to the both of you.", "NTA, you aren't comfortable with it, it seems. This is one of those things where I would stick by your fiance. What you guys are doing is basically a memorial tribute to his mom. Even if he had a healthy relationship with step mom, honoring her in this way while she is alive wouldn't make sense.", "NTA", "NTA.\n\nYou're wearing your fiance's mom's jewelry as a way to have her at your wedding. Your fiance's stepmother will be there in person, so why would you need to wear her jewelry, too?", "Definitely would not want my future children around that pair.", "NTA - you're wearing a piece of his mother jewellery because she isn't alive, it is a memorial to her.  FIL & Step-MIL will be at the wedding (unless they decide to behave like children & not go) so you don't need to wear anything in their memory.\n\nMay be your future children will be better off without them in their lives.  You husband seems to want to keep them at a distance.", "Agreed. It's all about appearances. They only want this so they can claim fianc\u00e9 accepts her in the motherly role.", "Hijacking the top post to say:  Block them on your phone.  And on all other social media. You've given them an answer, and now they're nagging you to change their mind.  Ignore them.", "Great comment.  Also, not Op\u2019s job to build \u201ca bridge\u201d between her husband and his father/stepmom.  That construction project is between the three of them.\n\nAs for the emotional blackmail around the future relationships\u2026who needs toxic blackmailers?  That\u2019s assholery.\n\nOp is NTA.", "Perfect", "Although the threat not to be in the future children's life sounds more like a blessing than a threat.", "But she will.point out the brooch OP is wearing to anyone who will listen... it's about her (FMIL)", "I just wonder, if their POV will change, when the babies'll come and they'll need someone for babysitting ;).", "Stepsmother decided to use denying unborn grandchildren their grandparents as a threat.  Stepsmother is damned lucky to be still in the wedding.", "This is an interesting compromise and worth thinking about. Especially if they\u2019re already invited to the ceremony then it could be presented as a way of making sure that there are good memories for everyone and no conflict to mark the day.

That's the part that makes them most definitely assholes.", "\"She suggested she had wanted to mention it to my fianc\u00e9 but knew he would not. But she thought I would not hold any hard feelings toward her.\"  \n\n\nYep. Her fianc\u00e9's step-mom is well aware of where she stands in her step-son's life. She knew he would reject her request, so she tried the stealth manoeuvre as her first move. It is not about sentiment, but is, as you said, absolutely about appearances.", ">not Op\u2019s job to build \u201ca bridge\u201d between her husband and his father/stepmom\n\nSomeone once said it's my duty as a wife to mend the relationship between my husband and his family. They are so lucky they didn't say it to me directly. But when I heard about it from a 3rd party, I laughed so hard I had tears running down my face."]}
