The tantrum and throwing stuff is not ok, neither is using you as his maid an not cleaning up after himself.", "Throwing things is definitely considered abuse, sounds like he needs some counselling.", "He's taking advantage of his mental state to use you as a maid, is not hard to throw garbage away... stop picking up his shit and make him responsible or you're going to pick up his garbage your whole life?", "Not cleaning up after yourself is considered mental illness? Your husband is an asshole.", "NTA. Sounds like a huge case of weaponized incompetence, not to mention using is mental health issues as an excuse for it. Anxiety and depression doesn't prevent you from throwing something out when the trash is *right there*. \n\n\\- someone with cptsd, anxiety, and depression", "Why are you married to this slob?", "NTA, tell him to seek help and do better or you'll dump him.", "So I have C-PTSD, Major Depressive Disorder, anxiety, and ADHD, and I too struggle with mess. So I get it. But. I don\u2019t leave trash or things like that. I\u2019m messy, not dirty, if that makes sense. \n\nIf he can make the effort to \u201cmake a joke\u201d by leaving his trash around, then he can also make the effort to throw away his trash. His reaction was very out of proportion as well. \n\nWhat gets me is the line about how it was less work for you to just throw it away. That says to me that it\u2019s a conscious choice to leave his trash because you\u2019ll clean up after him. If he was more open to it, I would suggest asking what can help him with cleaning up after himself, like more trash cans around the house or in key locations. But this guy threw a tantrum and threw things? Nope. \n\nBoth of you need individual therapy and probably couples counseling. And if he isn\u2019t already in therapy? Then his mental health issues are an excuse, not a reason. I have been disabled since 2012, and the reason my wife and I are still together despite her having to take a larger work load is because she sees me actively working to get better. Heck, I opened a business this year. If he\u2019s not putting in the work and trying to do better, then it\u2019s all lip service. \n\nNTA", "He doesn't realize how frustrating it is??? Of course he does, you did it to him ONCE and he lost the plot. The instant rage, throwing things, darvo behavior...massive red flags of abuse. NTA", "Who snacks THIS MUCH?

If you feel bad, it's better to take some distance.", "NTA. He\u2019s throwing things. He\u2019s a hypocrite who can dish it out but can\u2019t take it. \n\nDoes he do anything else that makes you feel unappreciated or messed with? How many other \u201cjokes\u201d does he pull?", "NTA and this isn\u2019t a small issue IMO \n\nHis \u201cjoke\u201d was designed to *put you in your place*.

I\u2019d get out and away from him.", "NTA and you should seriously reconsider the relationship. he uses the mental health issues as an excuse for his horrible behaviour. you are NOT his momma and he has zero reasons to throw tantrums and start throwing things around like a teenager whenever there is a slight inconvenience for him. \n\nhe is seriously using you as his bangmaid, shamelessly even. and you suck it up thinking that it's just his depression...  \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f please take some time to think of his behaviour in general. i already know this isn't the only red flag he shows you. this guy is definitely not husband material.", "I have PTSD, depression, and ADHD, as well as other non-mental health issues. I never expect my partner to clean up after me, and feel guilty when he even takes my dirty plate to the kitchen. I can\u2019t fathom making somebody else clean up after me and blaming it on my mental health. NTA.", "He\u2019s seeing what he can get away with.

Ew.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nare you getting anything possitive out of this relationship?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBecause, you could be single and foster troubled teens if this was the dynamic you were looking for...", "NTA honey, I feel so bad for you. You're one deeply brainwashed woman who trained to think that this is normal behavior from people with ptsd, depression and anxiety. Your husband actively taunts you and leaves a mess for you every day, then laughs at you as clean it up like a maid.  \n\nYou need to pack your clothes and leave.", "NTA-all this shit adds up.  He needs to start doing the basic shit he'd have to do in his parents' house. I'm not letting you leave trash all over if you're a grown ass person.", "NTA His joke shows he is aware of his messy behaviour, he recognises your frustration with his behaviour and rather than address either of these things positively, he chose to deliberately antagonise you, and then dismiss your very natural reaction to this provocation. He\u2019s not struggling to tidy up, he\u2019s not exerting himself in the slightest to tidy up. He\u2019s so certain you\u2019ll do it, he\u2019s not even trying to hide his complete disinclination to pick up after himself. Stop making excuses for him, he\u2019s a lazy manipulative AH.", "I think this emblematic of a larger issue. It\u2019s not that your husband has mental health struggles, it\u2019s that he doesn\u2019t put things in the trash after you clean. He\u2019s not being respectful of the work you have to do to clean up after him, like a little kid. Obviously, when it\u2019s his laptop, things change. I would suggest getting a housekeeper to come in every two weeks. Maybe also couples therapy. Since he\u2019s thrown things around, I would at least insist on him getting individual therapy. That would be the least he can do. \n\nNTA", "NTA I have serious psychological issues and I throw things in the trash can because it's easy and respectful.

Like for real? What do you all want?", "NTA. 30 years of marriage I quit taking and like it on his chair. Hint taken", "NTA but your husband is.  His disabilities are being used as an excuse to be disrespectful to you.  Couples counseling is a good idea if you want this marriage to continue.", "ESH. His anxiety and depression isn\u2019t an excuse to be untidy, especially since he knows it bothered you. Trying to get back at him by putting a box on his laptop is immature though.

One of my biggest pet peeves is people who pick at, makes jokes at the expense of, etc. and then lose their shit when someone does the same thing to them. \n\nIf he can\u2019t handle others making jokes at his expense, he needs to stop doing it to others.

Seriously?", "NTA, I have all of those same mental issues your husband has and likely also ADHD. I struggle with cleaning at times, but you know what, I still dont make my gf be my damn maid.

Throwing shit and yelling is abuse. And the rest of it is a horrendous sense of entitlement coupled with a belief that your time and feelings are less important than his. \n\nOnly you can know why you allow him to treat you that way.
