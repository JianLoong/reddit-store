Like the AC thing, why wake everyone up?  I would sneak sooo quietly over there and turn it off rather than make this whole production.  My ex thought nothing of waking me up for the smallest reasons.  Don't know why I accepted that sort of behavior, or thought it was normal at all. \n\nAnd the pinching -- \"*when I got mad, my reaction was the problem*.\" Oof I relate so hard.  There were so many *small* things my ex did consistently - give me odd nicknames, tickle my scalp in this weird way,  pick at my back, etc - that even though I expressed how I disliked it, they *continued doing all the time*.  If I dared get mad, or even pulled away too fast, all of a sudden I had anger issues and needed therapy.  What a crock of utter, gaslighting bullshit.  \n\nMy ex would get weird about small noises too, they also would've gotten mad at the sunglasses lol.  They would get irrationally angry when I made that soft gulping noise in my throat when I *drank water*. \n\nIt is so frustrating how much time I wasted being picked-on, bad-mouthed, and unhappy.  Lucky to have a wonderful SO now who would never even dream of doing any of this shit.", "I'm more knowledgeable about child psychology than adult, but in kids, creating messes is a pretty common trauma response. It gives them a way to exert control over their environment, even if they know it's going to get them in trouble because, like most mental health issues, it's not necessarily a rational impulse. I would be surprised if this kind of impulse doesn't translate to adults as well (Take hoarders as an example), the difference is in self control and rationalization. \n\nWhether the husband can recognize or start to control this behavior depends where he is in his mental health journey. The exact symptoms and coping mechanisms are different for everyone, even depression or ADHD are wildly different from person to person. And while I WANT to say \"The symptoms are understandable but being a jerk isn't\"... Unfortunately that tracks as well, could easily be anger and denial if he hasn't accepted his issues yet. We don't know how long this has been going on so it's hard to say if this dude is really struggling or just taking advantage of the situation to be awful.", "Why the hell do you all date such morons and keep up with their terrible behaviour?

How comes these ppl are always toooo depressed to do the \"bad\" tasks, but not too depressed for the stuff they like? What a happy coincident. I'm not too depressed to order a pizza and eat it, but i'm too depressed to pay for it or throwing away the garbage.. mhmmmm, sure. This ppl are weaponizing their mental health issues and their spouses just keep up with it? Ok, you do you, but i'm out of here.", ">The other day, he put a biscuit wrapper on the radiator where I would see it to see if I would say anything to him about it.\n\nDo you think PTSD makes you an AH?

Yes, he has mental health issues. No, it's not on you to fix them. But, If you want to stay with him you both need to figure out this together. It's like this: you feel frustrated about the trash, he has difficulty going all the way to the trash (for whatever reason). The solution could be something as simple as having more trash cans, having a trashcan on the way to somewhere etc.\n\nSomething I do feel is concerning and warrants therapy is his actions when he gets angry, throwing stuff is not normal. He needs help. If you don't have it in you to help him in his recovery or live with him while he struggles/helps himself, the best thing to do is leave.", "NTA \n\nYou are living with a child. \n\n> I also understand that having mental health issues can make it difficult to keep on top of things  \n>  \n>\"The other day, he put a biscuit wrapper on the radiator where I would see it to see if I would say anything to him about it.

It\u2019s really sad when something that\u2019s no fault of the person becomes a barrier to them being able to lead a normal life. \n\nImagine someone, through no fault of their own, lost their genitals.  It would really narrow their options for doing normal things like having romantic relationships and getting married. And nobody would blame the prospective spouse for not being able to overlook it. \n\nIt\u2019s also possible that if someone, through no fault of their own, has a nervous system condition that means they can\u2019t help but be threatening and violent (throwing things IS violence). Then sadly, that condition excludes them from being able to have normal relationships. \n\nYes it\u2019s sad and maybe unfair. But the injustice was caused by what/whoever wronged the person, not the person that is trying to have a loving relationship with them. \n\nMaybe it\u2019s not his fault that he\u2019s like this, but it is his responsibility to fix it if he wants to be able to lead a normal life and keep people like you in his life.

When I was a nanny after a year of arguments about bringing dirty dishes back to the kitchen, the mum found a pile of dirty plates in 13/14 yo bedroom and put them under their duvet/comforter. When the teen came back from school and found them, an argument kicked off etc but it forced the teen to think about consequences which is an important aspect, I think your partner needs to learn as well. I think the thing is if to back up your actions. Not be sorry, and be brave. He can do it, you can do it! If you can't do it, then nor can he. I'm talking about leaving mess in communal, shared spaces. You are allowed to take action after trying to talk to him if he doesn't change.  In many situations it might be a great area and you'd have to be careful about presuming you are right. But in this situation, he's not undoing your cleaning as if he wants to live in a messy house and you are running it! So therefore he's enjoying all the benefits of your labour. Now, that's not ok.\n\nOne thing I recommend for you, and your partner if he is willing, is to get a beginner book on non violent communication. It's unfortunately named that way but it's actually just about learning what words really mean and how we often don't realise what we are sending as mixed messages, or failing to say . It's a self help process that helps you listen to what is said to you and then ask the right questions to quickly get to the truth without upsetting each other. I'm learning it and I'm single. So it can't be used all day, it's really lovely. I wish it was just called Open Messages or something like that. But anyway it would be one way to let him know what's happening for you, and what is going to happen if this continues- which is going to become his problem. (Not a threat, but when you start looking after number one.... He's going to notice). Best of luck x", "NTA he sounds like a giant child, not like a ptsd anxiety sufferer.

He\u2019s capable of throwing trash away. I\u2019d collect it all routinely and dump it in his gaming chair because he\u2019s not a child and your aren\u2019t a maid. If he can\u2019t throw out trash then at least it can be kindly consolidated to his personal space. It reminds me of my one college roommate who got fed up with a third roommate (there were 4 of us) who never cleaned after cooking and let leftover food sit out in the pans, stinking and attracting bugs forever after promising to do better for months - one day she dumped it all on the offenders\u2019s bed, pans with 1/2 filled ramen/egg/sauce, etc. End of problem.", "NTA.
