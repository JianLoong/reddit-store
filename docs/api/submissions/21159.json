Yes mental health can affect daily life, that said, putting garbage in the garbage is a small step. He is using his illnesses as a smokescreen so he can get OP to do all 5e work.  NTA", "People throw stuff to show that they could be throwing stuff at you, but aren't. Yet.\n\nWhy are you with this guy?\n\nNTA", "NTA. He\u2019s using his mental illness as an excuse. Clutter is certainly a symptom of his illness but wilfully goading you, leaving rubbish ***that*** close to the bin (eta) and throwing things in a rage is entirely assholish.", "He's not depressed, he's a lazy slob. Sell his laptop and hire a maid.\n\nNTA.", "You are NTA but you should train your child to put his rubbish away.", "NTA. If he can\u2019t take the same joke then he shouldn\u2019t make the joke. You honestly deserve better. Massive red flags there", "NTA - throwing stuff is a red flag.  He needs consoling, you probably need it, and as a couple you probably need it.  That being said there is no guarantee he will except. I\u2019d protect yourself, throwing stuff can lead to worse violence.", "Throw away the man, marry the bin.", "**NTA**\n\nWTF?! I suffer acute Anxiety and Depression and live alone with 2 cats. No matter what, you still have to pick up ater yourself and clean up after yourself.\n\nThe fact that he chucked a tantrum because you didn't clean up after his mess is disgusting! I think, to start getting him to clean up after himself, you should just start putting his messes onto his gaming laptop. It should get the point across. If he throws a tantrum, put on headphones and play music, or wear earplugs and completely ignore him. He's giving you double the work. It's about time he put his big boy pants on and start cleaning up after himself.\n\nEdit: Added the 'F' to \"Fact\" as my f key isn't working each time I press it.", "NTA. He is absolutely using his depression and anxiety as an excuse. it doesn't make you incapable, it can leave you feeling overwhelmed and like not doing it. But in general people with depression/anxiety such that they struggle to clean up aren't proud of it and feel guilty and shitty about it. They don't force their partner to do it all then make a joke by intentionally leaving a mess when they didn't have to.\n\nThen when he reacts the same way to the same 'joke' when you made it suggests a lot. Sounds like he's basically just training you to clean up and making not cleaning up too unpleasant so you just do it for him and don't both complaining about it. \n\nEven if it's more genuine depression, then the key to working through it and getting better is him forcing himself to tidy up and you forcing yourself not to give in and always do it for him. You can't simply willpower yourself out of depression, but you can will yourself to tidy up even if you feel like shit but the more often you ignore it and the more often you get away with not doing it hte harder it gets to do each time.", "NTA. I have combined type ADHD, PTSD, generalized anxiety, and depression and I\u2019m fully capable of throwing away my trash. Thats no excuse, he\u2019s just lazy. People can have depressive episodes and struggle with executive dysfunction, sure, but this does not sound like that. Laughing and saying it\u2019s a joke proves he\u2019s just being a thoughtless asshole, and sometimes an intentional asshole!", "NTA karma \ud83d\ude0c", "NTA. He isn\u2019t leaving things around the house due to depression if he\u2019s able to test you and say he\u2019s making a joke out of it.  I fail to see where his joke is funny at all. Him throwing things is a big red flag, as well as his tantrum and reaction.  Is this common?", "NTA\u2026 my partner has PTSD, anxiety/depression and while I feel I nag at him to tidy up, cause he\u2019s forgetful and just won\u2019t\u2026 he never has thrown things or screamed at me for asking. He just apologizes and does it. He needs to be in therapy and/or medicated.", "NTA", "NTA if you have the control to actively make a mess when you fully finished cleaning just to annoy you, you have control to have a basic cleaning of a 7-year-old.\r  \n\r  \nHe does not respect your effort, your time and seems simply exhausting, or it is only justified or is so used to being treated well by you and pampered that he decides not to actively improve because it is simpler and more comfortable. It's your husband, not your son.", "He is 100% taking advantage of you. If he can\u2019t take a joke he shouldn\u2019t make it. \n\nMental health is not an excuse for his bullshit.", "As someone with diagnosed CPTSD, autism, adhd, depression and anxiety... he's using his mental health struggles as an excuse not to pay attention to yours. Your mental health is equally as important and if you can go get some counselling so you can support yourself, do it as soon as possible. \n\nTo deal with him leaving stuff everywhere, get a few cheap buckets and use them as rubbish bins. Put one in any area he can't help but leave trash and then when its full tell him to take it out. Say it once and then leave it there for him to deal with. You aren't his maid and it's time you start to give yourself more respect because you won't get it from him.", "NTA", "NTA. Experiencing mental health challenges doesn\u2019t mean you can be an asshole. Mental health shouldn\u2019t be blamed for a grown mans childish behaviour.", "ESH - his behavior is obviously not excusable but trying to \u201cget him back\u201d rather than have an adult conversation is childish behavior too", "Abusers only get better at abusing if given counseling.  OP needs to realize her situation and make a decision.", "Right, you can't just state \"I have ptsd\" and then do nothing for it and use it as an excuse to be a dick. I hope he actually is in therapy, but I doubt it. I just see a lazy oaf who expects his wife to be his maid", "Eh, I'll advocate to the depression from PTSD making you a bit of a slob. I have both and it's hard to clean up with a \"what's the point\" kind of attitude. \n\nThat being said, it's a bit easier to clean up in that state if it's something you're doing for someone else, because although you're depressed, the idea of letting someone down (and thus feeling worse) helps with some of it. \n\nEither way, the dude needs therapy, because it's clearly messing with his life and ability to do things. It's still his responsibility to be an active member of the household.", "And while I can sympathize with mental health issues, he\u2019s not going to get PTSD throwing out a wrapper. She\u2019s asking for the bare minimum and now he\u2019s making messes on purpose because he thinks it\u2019s funny??  Dude needs a swift kick in the ass, he\u2019s just taking advantage of having a \u201cmaid\u201d.", "I was wondering the same thing. PTSD gets thrown around a lot. This seems more like an abusive relationship to me. Definitely NTA.", "This is the \"shit bucket\" approach I believe, lol, I use it too! I'm trying to be less messy for my husband, and it's really helped.", "I do online therapy through MDLive and it's video both ways. Surely other telemeds have that same option.", "This is why I installed toilets in all the corners I kept pissing in.", "I have dealt with depression and ADHD, and have had issues with keeping my living space clean \u2013 but I have never once worked as hard as this guy apparently does to maximize the mess I create, taken joy in making someone else clean up that mess I maximized, or blown my top because the person I chose to burden (with cleaning up after me) and manipulate (by creating additional mess as a \"joke\" [read: test to see if OP is completely controlled yet, or still needs more breaking down]) dared to do *one small thing, one time* to make a point about how incredibly selfish, thoughtless, and lazy I was being.", "American here who tried Tunnocks when I was in Edinburgh, those things fuckin rule!  We have something similar here called Mallomars but they pale in comparison to Tunnocks.", "That's exactly it -- \"maximize the mess \\[he creates\\].\" That's what he's doing. Excellent phrase", "This is what I grew up with my mom making as sugar cookies - southern style tea cakes! It\u2019s the same recipe we\u2019d use to cutout Christmas cookies. I prefer soft cookies so they never were my favorite."]}
