He needs counseling.", "NTA. Tell your husband that you would like to go to counseling with him to find out from his therapist what you can do to handle this situation with him. I\u2019m willing to bet that he will refuse your request. I would then find a therapist for yourself to help with you find some coping skills. OP, you have a challenge on your hands and you need to ensure that your needs are met first otherwise you can help your husband.\n\nI would also suggest that you tell your husband that every time he leaves a mess you will continue to stack his mess on his gaming console. He will be furious but that is on him. I would tell him if he doesn\u2019t like it then he can do better because you will no longer enable his poor behavior. \n\nTake care of yourself and I wish you well!", "What a flaming AH.  Isn\u2019t he doing things to get a reaction out of you?  Maybe I\u2019m petty but I\u2019d escalate.  Dump a whole garbage can on his OC.  NTA", "You\u2019re in the UK. Anyway, leave him.  Not enough upside to the situation.  NTA.", "NTA. Amazing how not funny it is when suddenly it\u2019s a minor inconvenience to him", "NTA. If he's well enough to fetch snacks and play games, then he's well enough to clean up his crap. He's being disrespectful of your shared space.", "Nta - he's intentionally messing with you and then being rude when the \"joke\" is on him.  Let him live in his filfth. Stay with a friend for a while after you get back.", "NTA.  PTSD allows a person to be a messy and not take responsibility?    I am not an expert but this seems a bit of a stretch.  Especially after the manipulation disguised as a joke.  \n If he really has PTSD he should be in therapy.   There are better treatments.  If he refuses I would think twice about his maturity level and seek assistance with his attitude about treating you like a servant etc.", "NTA and if he thinks it\u2019s so funny I really don\u2019t think his mental health can be blamed for his habits, sounds more like he\u2019s made you his mother", "NTA\n\n>He\u2019s got PTSD and suffers from anxiety and depression, which means he often creates mess and struggles to tidy it up.\n\nAs someone with depression and anxiety, I fail to see how these things are connected. Sure, depression may make you pay less attention to your environment and make you exhausted, but it doesn't make you blind and incapable of caring about your partner's needs. He can carry a bin around with him if reaching for it is impossible. Or he can eat by the kitchen table so that all the mess is in one place. \n\nWe let men opt out from caring for the home at the slightest excuse. Mental health issues don't make you an inconsiderate, self-absorbed asshole \u2013 unless you were one to begin with.", "Nah this is just him being able to dish it out, but unable to take it. You should keep doing it when he doesn't clean up.\n\nNTA", "NTA, I, myself,  have PTSD, bipolar and high anxiety but I still try to keep things picked up. Does the house get messy? Yes. Does the house get totalled during a depressive episode? Yes. But with my partners help and understanding and a great deal of medication and effort in my part, things are getting better. I know everyone's trauma is different, but it does sould like he is using his mental issues as a crutch. It takes time to work through things, but he has to make some effort. And his little 'joke' means he knows it bothers you and doesn't seem to care. Having a tantrum and throwing things, major red flags, sis.", "NTA. What does PTSD have any with cleaning up after himself?   This guy is acting like a boy.", "NTA - He's using weaponized incompetence so he never has to do anything. Keep putting his garbage on his laptop until he learns where the garbage can is.", "NTA, why are you two still married? Also, why are you two not in counseling?", "NTA.", "I am not as understanding as you are.  I would not give him a pass on picking up his own stuff.  It seems as if he enjoys you doing his bidding - maybe a power thing?  Time for counseling to nip this in the bud and if he refuses to go, or is uncooperative, then it is time to leave.  You can do much better.", "Next time put the empty box in the cupboard.", "Yeah NTA here.  Mental illness does play a huge roll in how we keep our space.  Depression rooms and houses are definitely a thing that people have to deal with on a daily basis.  And OP, you are doing a wonderful job of trying to maintain a home and a safe space.  But at this point, your husband is no longer trying to help himself and he is purposely expecting you to clean up after him and that is not fair to anyone.  He is taunting you and baiting you and when you flipped the script on him, he freaked out.  Thats emotionally abusive and not acceptable.  I would stop cleaning up after him and maybe join him in a few of his therapy sessions to work some of these issues out.", "Two things can be true at the same time.  Your husband can legit have PTSD and struggle mightily with that, and he can also be using this condition to avoid taking on adult responsibility.  It sounds like he wants a mother more than a wife.  You are NTA.", "NTA\nHaving mental health issues can absolutely affect the motivation but \nthat\u2019s him being an asshole, not having a mental illness. He does it because you clean up after him. I have depression and anxiety and yet I can somehow see my way to throw wrappers in the bin especially after someone just cleaned the area.\nI also see my husband leave his garbage on the counter\u2026.ya know, right on top of where the garbage bin is under the counter! \nIt\u2019s men being fucking babies, not mentally ill.", "I'm going with NTA because he opened himself up to having the joke he played on you played on him. \n\nIf he hadn't played the joke first I would have said YTA for being inconsiderate of his mental health.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
