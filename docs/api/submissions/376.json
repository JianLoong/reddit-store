Could you have responded better to your mother\u2019s behavior?  Yes, but you are 17, you were high, and you were completely blindsided by what you were witnessing.  But you still managed to intervene and defend the brother who has been favored by your dad.  Outstanding.  I wish Jake had stayed to hear you being his shield.  \n\nYou mentioned favoritism from your dad but what about your mother?  Has she shown favoritism toward you and your younger brother?  Did she go to your concerts but not Jake\u2019s games?  Did she treat him differently at home?  \n\nThere seems to be more going on here with your parents, but especially with your mother.  Interestingly, she did not speak up for your younger brother but used you as the slighted example. This, added to the fact she wasn\u2019t confronting your father, is rather telling.  She used Jake as a proxy for your dad and you as a proxy for herself.  \n\nIt could be financial problem, like if she found out Jake had a college fund but you don\u2019t.  Perhaps Jake was getting SSI checks, and they stopped when he turned 18.  If she does not have her own income, she may be worried about her marriage failing (thus the week-long crying jag).  Or an age crisis: Jake is gone, and you are not that far behind him.  Or, she was simply hoping Jake would remain at college, and your dad would direct more attention to you and your little brother *(and her)* instead of asking Jake to come home because \u2018he missed him\u2019.\n\nThere are myriad possibilities.  Regardless, she was entirely wrong to attack Jake that way. You *could* try to sit down with your mother, apologize,  and ask frankly what is driving this uncharacteristic behavior - respectfully, of course.  But it is probably way beyond your pay grade.  She needs to talk to a professional.  And where the heck is your dad in all of this?\n\nYou need to focus on your grades, not driving while high, being a good influence on lil bro, and being awesome.

He\u2019s 18 and old enough to realize and acknowledge he\u2019s being treated differentlyand your father neglects you. And your dad is a huge asshole. Are your dad and mom married? If so, shame on her!", "I mean this sounds like an issue way above the paygrade of some judgemental people on the internet, and the best I can come up with is ESH with the exception of the youngest brother. Your dad takes the crown AH with your mom sitting by his side as the queen AH. But let me be very clear: it is not your faults that you three are in the states you are now because y'all are products of the environment you were raised in but make no mistake, you and your older brother (based on what is written in this post) can end up AHs yourselves here if you get lost in this sea of toxicity. Your family needs help, this is an unsustainable level of dysfunction.\n\n*Disregard this next part if you're not in a country that has similar laws to the US.* First of all, I get wanting to experiment with substances and have fun at your age, I did it all myself. But what you need to understand is that knowing your kid is doing drugs at a young age is a humongous fear factor for the vast majority of parents. Even if your mom gave you the impression that she doesn't care if you do drugs, I would bet money that she does care about this topic and the levels of dysfunction in her behavior and actions mask it from your awareness. And even without that interpretation, it is verging into AH territory on both your parts on thinking that coming home intoxicated while you're still under the legal limit would/should be a non issue. **If you think you're grown enough to do drugs and get high, then you are definitely grown enough to have some foresight on doing so in a manner that's responsible and doesn't cause unnecessary strain and conflict in your household.** Most kids when I was your age, unless they had really permissive parents, had the strategies of either timing their highs so they would sober up before going home or they would make overnight plans. It's also shocking to me that y'all are able to scream and swear at your parent/guardian like this when you're being called out for being inappropriately intoxicated and not experience any consequences for that behavior. That detail suggests to me that y'all aren't necessarily the most cooperative or compromising people yourselves here. An easy way to demonstrate that y'all are above the toxicity and dysfunction is to prepare better for your outings and to keep it more separate from the house.\n\nYour brother is also an AH because there is a kernel of truth buried deep in your mom's outpouring of insanity back there. If your brother cares about the two of you, and has a decent level of awareness, then there is literally no way that he hasn't noticed not once that his siblings aren't getting treated the same as him and vice versa. If he loves the two of you as an older brother, then he wouldn't be this ignorant to the situation and he wouldn't be silent on this matter, particularly with his siblings, so something isn't adding up here. I'm sorry but he does have a minor AH component in that. He is 18 now, and the contrast in your father's regard is obvious at home considering you wrote that he didn't acknowledge you and the youngest brother's existence when it wasn't to his benefit. If Jake somehow has been genuinely 100% unaware of this difference, then that too spells a problem with Jake to me. Something is wrong with this picture because while Jake is largely innocent in all of this, this particular detail bugs me and keeps him in AH territory. Not to mention the obvious truth that it would be far more effective in influencing a positive change in the house if Jake voiced concerns about the disparity in treatment versus if either you or your brother did. The responsibility for this change doesn't lie on Jake's shoulders and it isn't Jake's fault that this dynamic is so toxic, but **I don't like the fact that Jake has had so little to say on this matter that you aren't even sure if he's even aware of it or not.**\n\nYou are also an AH on a minor level for snapping the way you did, even if it is understandable how you got to that point. But you also aren't a little kid anymore, you're close to becoming an adult, and a big part of adulthood is learning how to not meet the toxic energy created by antagonistic people at their level.\n\nYour dad is the highest caliber of AH here for all of the obvious reasons. Had he not fostered this environment, none of you would be struggling in the ways y'all are.\n\nWhile your mother is in peak AH territory with your dad, I get the impression from your post that she has less power and say in this household than meets the eye. I think there's some serious issues in their relationship that have been translated in their respective treatments of the three of you. If my assumption there isn't off base, then it's entirely possible that she was projecting a lot of this onto Jake because she has no acknowledgement or say with her husband here. I wouldn't be surprised if mom did actually talk to dad many times about this behind closed doors, and was silenced in some manner of another. It doesn't excuse the fact that she didn't act on this issue and allowed it to fester and grow. She's one of the two primary adults and it was and still is her responsibility to take the reigns on addressing this issue and not yours or Jake's. But honestly, it doesn't sound like she has that much control or power in the household when two HIGH children are able to scream and swear at her to their heart's content and not face any consequences. Dad hasn't even *talked* to either of you about this issue even though she's isolated herself and has been crying for over a week? Yeah something's not right with this picture.\n\nBottom line, all of you NEED to find a way to get to family therapy.\n\nI am so sorry that you've endured this for so long. There is no good reason for you to have grown up with such dysfunction in your household. All three of you deserved and still deserve so much better than this.", "YTA. Your mum has clearly reached a breaking point. While she may have lashed out at the wrong person now because you yelled at her she feels even more alone. She's probably thinking I stuck up for my daughter but she yelled at me and broke my heart. Your father sounds awful.", "YTA. So let's get this straight. Both you and Jake are high as a kite, your mother defends you, you bloody well attack her for defending you, you call her names, and then wonder why she is so upset. On top of that, you were complaining about the inequity of your father' parenting. I feel so sorry for your mother.", "YTA there was no need for calling her insane", "So your mom took your side and you yelled at her? While she has been heartbroken for years seeing how your dad is treating you and your brother and she finally snapped? To protect you? \n\nYTA, OP. This is displacement. You cannot or you dare not yell at your dad. You cannot yell at your stepbrother because as you said he's more or less innocent in this. So you yelled at someone who has to take it, because she cannot disown you: your mom. \n\nNow, she displaced her anger too. She yelled at your brother while she should have yelled at your father. Your father is the bad guy here, not you, not your mom, not his three kids. You are all victims.

Mom should ground your dumb ass.", "In this case YTA. Your mom has been watching your brother being favorite for 17 years. She wanted your father to give equally attention to you and your brother. I admit it was mean of her to yell at your brother like that but think in her point of view how she must have been so furious that the favoritism was going on and on. Your mom is not insane, that is way she is showing how much she loves you and how much better you deserve in life.", "YTA.\nYou side with the brother you criticise in your own post.\nAnd you seem more angry at your mother because she didn't defend you before than you are at your father and brother.", "YTA.", "YTA.

You don't deserve a loving mother.", "YTA", "NAH. You acted out of shock at seeing your mom behaving that way. I can't blame you for that. Also, because you're still young, I'm not sure you knew how your mom would feel hearing you talk to her like that. Based on the comments you've made, you realize that now and intend to apologize. You just learned a valuable life lesson on that one.\n\nAs for your dad, well, he is the AH. He has hurt you, both your brothers, and your mom. There's a lot of hurt there. Telling you to get over it isn't helpful. It just teaches you that your feelings don't matter. Your emotions do matter. You matter.", "Nta", "ESH.\n\nThe mom went to far but the cynic in me wonders if Jake is really as oblivious as OP thinks he is.", "ESH (tough decision)\n\nI say this as someone with a reactive parent that I have had plenty of screaming matches with in the past. I\u2019ve always thought that they were the only AH, and that I was right to call them irrational, disrespectful, crazy, etc. I then realized that they are completely set in their ways. They will never change, and I\u2019m honestly an AH if I think my insults will change them. I\u2019ve accepted this about them, and in doing so, our relationship is so much more manageable. Sure, there\u2019s plenty of times I disagree with them, and I still tell them how I feel, but there\u2019s no longer rage underneath every conversation. I don\u2019t stoop to their level.

I would bet that even though this is the first time OP has heard something like this, its not the first time Jake has heard it from her or at the very least felt it. \n\nThe father \"prioritizing\" him more might be him trying to make up to Jake that he not only grew up with emotionally a single parent, but also with a stepmother that doesn't see him as a full part of the family and actively dislikes him. If this is the case, then the father is the real AH for letting Jake grow up with a stepmother that hates him.", "Possibly. I\u2019ll be honest, I never asked about how my mom and dad got together.

He\u2019s hardly ever home even before he left for college. \n\nI can agree that I didn\u2019t communicate properly but I don\u2019t agree that my brother deserved to be yelled at like that.

When it isn\u2019t even his fault? \n\nI\u2019m sorry if I sound upset, writing this post made me realize that my mom had 17 years yet she only cares now.

Sometimes being the \"favorite\" brings a ton of other pressures. You always have to perform to a certain standard, behave the \"right\" way, excel in your competitions. You don't always get to be who you are because you have to be the show pony on display.\n\nI think the best thing for you to do is talk to Jake. Apologize for your mom, and tell him that you are not mad at him, but at Dad. Ask him how he feels. Jake may have tried to talk to him or ask to include you in stuff. Jake may be acting out and getting high as a way to rebel and show his independence.\n\nYour dad really sucks, and mom picked the least helpful option from all the choices available to her.

Is your relationship with him actually mutually respectful and caring, or are you taking on the bulk of those aspects of the relationship? Is there any chance you are protecting your relationship with your brother at the expense of your relationship with your mom (though it seems that one isn't particularly awesome) out of a sense of obligation to the hierarchy your dad has created, or maybe because placing any responsibility for the continued favoritism might upset your father and increase the difference between the way you and older brother are treated by your father?\n\nDoes it at all seem fair to you that you were willing to yell at your mom to protect him, when he won't talk to your father after seeing how differently you and your younger brother are treated for his entire life, simply bc its not \"his business\"?
