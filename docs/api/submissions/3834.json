So I have tried to be there for her in my best abilities and parent her, tell her right and wrong, help her in school and empower her. Id like to think that we\u2019re pretty close.\n\nShe started uni in September, my bf(29M) and I are fully paying for her school. we gave her new laptop for school as well and keep on buying her whatever she wants and if it\u2019s in our capability. She started seeing someone in the past few months and then we even sat her down and talked to her and told her as this guy wasn\u2019t upto no good(we could tell). She told us she\u2019ll be careful but ended up getting her heart broken after two months when she found out that he is seeing two other girls as well. We have been there for her since she took it harshly. Giving her advice, providing support, letting her stay in my room with us as she doesn\u2019t wanna be alone.\n\nMy bf is about to get a big amount from his work soon, so we thought we will send my sister to weekly therapy,as she has expressed that she\u2019d like to go but doesn\u2019t have funds and set her a bank account and give her a good amount of money to kick start her savings. As we were never able to save money because of our financial problems.  \n\nBut my sister is very mean towards me, example; I always ask if she wants to go shopping or food with us but whenever she has to go somewhere, she never invites me but our cousin instead. My bf is from another country so we travel half the year to see his family, she says things like \u201cwell you roam around the world and live nice\u201d anytime tell her no from anything. Never wants to spend time with me. \n\nTbh I feel used, I do everything in capacity for her. I\u2019m trying to provided her with the support I never had growing up. Hence why, i have decided that i\u2019ll stop with the extra help such as gifts, helping with saving, helping with therapy and inviting her. I will only pay for her school as I\u2019m obliged to do that because of my culture but that\u2019s it. \n\nMy mom thinks im the AH for stopping. \n\n\n\nAlso English isn\u2019t my language, so please excuse my grammar.\n\nEdit; I have talked to her about this before. I told her how I feel and she said she understands and will correct her behaviour, be a more kinder towards me. She says she\u2019s thankful for me and my bf but then her actions are completely opposite. Anytime I need something small from her or her help, she would be very rude. When I wanna talk about something I\u2019m facing, she\u2019ll tell me get out of her room. Today my bf and I had planned date night but she asked us if she could come with us two days ago, we changed everything and said yes. Then she came to today and said oh please give me some money Im gonna go with our cousin(24F) instead. It was hurtful as I changed everything for her and then she just dumped me like that. When I told her this she said I was making a big deal out of this.\n\n\nTo clear a few things.\n\n- getting an education loan in my country is next to impossible, and without a degree here your chances for any career is literally zero. Hence why I\u2019m not stopping to pay for her college. \n- my bf and I are paying together because we work together, live together and share finances as well. We\u2019re partners in everything, we do. \n- the concept of part time job doesn\u2019t really exist in my country as well. The work from school is so much that there\u2019s no time left for anything. So she can\u2019t get a job.", "created_utc": 1670065046, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zbdqwl/aita_for_not_providing_extra_help_to_my_sister/", "score": 364, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Especially if she goes to college where they have therapists available for students usually (in the U.S., maybe not the same where you are).
