So I have tried to be there for her in my best abilities and parent her, tell her right and wrong, help her in school and empower her. Id like to think that we\u2019re pretty close.\n\nShe started uni in September, my bf(29M) and I are fully paying for her school. we gave her new laptop for school as well and keep on buying her whatever she wants and if it\u2019s in our capability. She started seeing someone in the past few months and then we even sat her down and talked to her and told her as this guy wasn\u2019t upto no good(we could tell). She told us she\u2019ll be careful but ended up getting her heart broken after two months when she found out that he is seeing two other girls as well. We have been there for her since she took it harshly. Giving her advice, providing support, letting her stay in my room with us as she doesn\u2019t wanna be alone.\n\nMy bf is about to get a big amount from his work soon, so we thought we will send my sister to weekly therapy,as she has expressed that she\u2019d like to go but doesn\u2019t have funds and set her a bank account and give her a good amount of money to kick start her savings. As we were never able to save money because of our financial problems.  \n\nBut my sister is very mean towards me, example; I always ask if she wants to go shopping or food with us but whenever she has to go somewhere, she never invites me but our cousin instead. My bf is from another country so we travel half the year to see his family, she says things like \u201cwell you roam around the world and live nice\u201d anytime tell her no from anything. Never wants to spend time with me. \n\nTbh I feel used, I do everything in capacity for her. I\u2019m trying to provided her with the support I never had growing up. Hence why, i have decided that i\u2019ll stop with the extra help such as gifts, helping with saving, helping with therapy and inviting her. I will only pay for her school as I\u2019m obliged to do that because of my culture but that\u2019s it. \n\nMy mom thinks im the AH for stopping. \n\n\n\nAlso English isn\u2019t my language, so please excuse my grammar.\n\nEdit; I have talked to her about this before. I told her how I feel and she said she understands and will correct her behaviour, be a more kinder towards me. She says she\u2019s thankful for me and my bf but then her actions are completely opposite. Anytime I need something small from her or her help, she would be very rude. When I wanna talk about something I\u2019m facing, she\u2019ll tell me get out of her room. Today my bf and I had planned date night but she asked us if she could come with us two days ago, we changed everything and said yes. Then she came to today and said oh please give me some money Im gonna go with our cousin(24F) instead. It was hurtful as I changed everything for her and then she just dumped me like that.

She's acting incredibly entitled.", "NAH Of course you feel used but she grew up thinking you providing is normal and something she doesn\u2019t have to be super grateful for. You took the role of her parent, which is admirable but to her that\u2019s just how it is. Generally teenagers take their friends out to do fun things and not their parent. That doesn\u2019t mean she doesn\u2019t care about you, she\u2019s just never thought about it from your perspective. If I was you I would first talk to her that you feel your relationship is a bit one sided and explain to her that you took your mom\u2019s role but that doesn\u2019t mean she is entitled to your money.

Welcome to parenthood. \n\nIf your goal is to punish your sister, and teach her that you're fragile and can't be trusted - then yes, you should take away all those things. \n\nIf your goal is to build your relationship with your sister, and help her in a way you weren't helped... You should tell her how you feel. That you've made serious sacrifices and expenditures for her, out of love more than obligation, and you feel unappreciated and used. If you do that, but make it clear that your continued support isn't at stake, she may respond honestly. Only through honesty can you build the relationship you clearly want with your sister. \n\nSo, YTA. Don't do it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

And it's much easier to leave in n anger than to leave just like that.", "NTA. You are her sister not her ATM. It appears that she has a sense of entitlement with regard to you because of the role you were forced into as a child yourself. Your sister needs to learn to respect and value you as a person and sister. She seems to think you owe her as a parent not a sister. She doesn\u2019t seem to recognize the sacrifices you had to make in order for her life to be better. This is unfortunate. You are right to want to pull back a bit of your financial support. Don\u2019t waiver if she has a tantrum. Try as best you can to communicate with her, without indulging her any longer. Perhaps with time she will see you are more than an ATM.", "NTA - Your sister become entitled, she needs to grown up", "NTA, don't even pay for her school or give her the extra funds.

There are some children struggling, they can\u2019t even find a sibling to help pay for even a snack. Your sister is 19 years old and getting everything handed to her.
