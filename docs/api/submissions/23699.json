Marco literally lives 2 houses down from us so he's over alot. Last Friday night Marco was over and I woke up to a loud noise. \n\nI rushed to check in with the boys and found them fell over on top of eachother in my son's gaming chair and there was a hickey on Marco's neck. It wasn't hard to guess what they were doing. My son came out to me a few months ago which was fine though I didn't know Marco was gay or that they were involved.  Marco pleaded with me not tell his parents cause he want out to them yet.  Marco's parents arent homophobic as far as I know ,but i told him no more sleepovers or being at the house by themselves  and that I wouldnt say anything to his parents. I told him to go home and I called his parents and let them know I sent him home and lied and said it was because I caught the boys trying to get into my liquor cabinet.\n\nThey believed it for a few days till they noticed the hickey he'd been trying to cover up and confronted him yesterday. He came out to them and I got an angry phone call while I was at work about not telling them immediately what actually happened and lying to them. I tried to explain it wasn't my place to say anything and that Marco asked me not too. They got mad and said they don't care that he's gay but they should've known as soon as I found out.

Nobody should out anybody, ever. And an adult out a child is extremely a power tripping, absolutely not move. Thank you for being a trusted adopt to both of these young men. Hopefully, his parents will calm down and return to their sense, eventually realizing that you were being protective of both minor children\u2019s privacy and confidence, rather than harming anybody.", "NTA - As a gay person, you 100% did the right thing and please don't let anyone else convince you otherwise. It's unfortunately a horrible world where outing him could have been worse than just ruining his moment to come out, and have put him in real danger, so thank you for not doing that. It's an awkward situation for you to be in, but you made the right choice.", "NTA. He's 15 and isn't harming himself, your son, or anyone else from what I can tell. Letting he choose how and when to tell his parents was the best move.", "NTA\n\nBut sweet fuck you had to say he was trying to steal out of your liquor cabinet?? Couldn't of said your son wasn't feeling well and wanted the night alone?", "NTA for not outing him.\n\nBut Y T A for the reason you gave, unless it was Marco\u2019s suggestion. You could have said almost anything else - someone in the house was sick, Marco had forgotten something important - or even just separated them for the rest of the night and said no more sleepovers from that date. They may have punished Marco for the dummy reason.", "NTA. It might not have been safe to \"out\" Marco to his parents. You weren't covering up for him, you were looking out for him. \n\nToo bad you couldn't just put them in separate rooms for the rest of the night so you didn't have to make up a lie, though. Have your son sleep in your room and leave Marco in your son's room or something.", "NAH. Coming out to your parents as a young boy is a very difficult thing to do, regardless of whether or not your parents are homophobic. Your parents could be the most understanding in the world, and coming out to them could still make you feel like your heart is going to burst out of your chest like some kind of extreme finisher from a fighting game. The fact that you didn't tell his parents is a really nice thing that you did for \"Marco,\" even if his parents later found out.  \n\n\nIn summary: NAH, you're being a bro for your son and his boyfriend.", "I'm sure it's just a knee jerk reaction to being the last to find out. If they're really OK with him being gay, surely they know deep down that it's not right to out someone. Hopefully they'll calm down and apologise to you soon because you're definitely NTA.", "NTA for not outing him but slight Y  T  A for lying about alcohol. That could've got him in lots of trouble. Why not say your son was sick? Or just got one of them to sleep in the living room? You had many options. You also need a better long term plan as your son is 14, he will be doing things,  it's part of growing up and by banning them from the house means you've taken away a safe space. Kids will do it anyway so consider how you want to proceed.", "Normally I'd say yes about covering for teens, but considering the climate around \"coming out\" it's completely understandable why you wouldn't want to out someone before they were ready. I vote NTA, since it was done with the best of intentions and it wasn't something that was horrifically dangerous.", "NTA. You tried to balance being a supportive parent with respecting Marco's wishes.", "NTA. \n\nHe didn't want them to know yet and he definitely didn't want someone else to tell them. You did the right thing.", "NTA. Their son didn't want to be outed. How is that so hard to understand for them??", "Nta. His parents are. Not your child. Not yoir place. Bounderies.", "NTA. Parents aren't entitled to know about their kids' sexuality - outing is outing, no matter how old the person involved is - you just \\*don't out someone, ever,\\* unless they have explicitly asked you to come out to someone for them. \n\nComing out is scary, even with people you feel like you know and trust. So, so many teenagers have found themselves suddenly homeless after coming out or being outed to their parents, and these people need to understand that the fear their son felt when he asked you not to say anything is not his fault, or probably even their fault, but the fault of every single one of those all-singing-all-dancing parade of assholes who cemented that story in his mind as a very real and very possible outcome. \n\nYou were also giving him the chance to come out to his own parents on his own time, in his own way, and once he's ready to do so and knows what he wants to say - instead of at 2am on a sleepover with everyone (very probably) yelling and/or having a lot of feelings.", "What an odd response from parents finding out their kid is dating someone.", "YTA for restricting get together in the first place and lying about a serious infraction that the boy didn't commit.

You didn't know their views or if it was unsafe for him to be out to his parents.  He could've ended up beaten, homeless, or dead.  You don't know.\n\nFrom their perspective you're lying about their son's activities and undermining them as parents.  Did they punish or talk to him in an appropriate way about the alcohol after it?  If so, that probably still useful point is now undermined to him.  Were he and your son going to be using protection?  They lost the opportunity to address that in a meaningful and timely manner. And now there's one less person they can trust with their son, because they don't know what you'll lie to them about next.\n\nI'm honestly not sure what the right answer is, but basically teenage stupidity created a situation in which nobody can come out a winner.", "NTA x 1000. You respected a child's request not to be outed so you did a stellar job. Tbh it sounds as though Marco's parents would have gone off at you in either scenario:\n\"How DARE you out our son!!!\"\n\"How DARE you NOT out our son!!!\"\nThey're just having a hard time dealing with his sexuality and you're an easier target. Don't stress man you did an excellent job respecting Marco.", "NAH I can understand why everyone reacted as they did.", "YTA.
