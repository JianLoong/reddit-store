She sewed it by hand and had her daughters photo taken. She saved the dress had her grand daughters photo taken in it. The granddaughter had her daughters photo taken in the same dress and so on. The dress is in really good condition. Each old the newborn daughter wears it once. After for a picture then it\u2019s immediately sealed in a special vintage dress plastic and stored away. My daughters each wore and and both are taking about in the future if they have daughters they want to have them wear it. I hope the tradition lives until the dress can\u2019t we worn anymore.\nAnyway my brother and his wife found out that they were pregnant with a little girl. His wife was excited to carry on the tradition of having her daughter wear the dress. Sadly at a little over 31 weeks she experienced a miscarriage. It was heartbreaking. They were in the hospital after the removal process. That\u2019s when my sister in law said \u201cI really want her to put the dress on\u201d. I had no problems with that. Then she said \u201cI also think that we should bury her in the dress. I think she should have the honor to be the last one to wear it.\u201d \nI understood what she meant but I said \u201cNo, it\u2019s an important part of the family. You can take a photo but you can not have the dress\u201d she began crying.\nI left the room. My bother followed me and called me an asshole saying that I need to let go of such a stupid tradition. I told him that she could use it for pictures but they couldn\u2019t keep it. My brother then said that once I gave it to them it\u2019s their property. \nAfterwards I refused to even let him take photos with it. My brother and his wife went zero contact with me afterwards. While some people agree with me others think that I should\u2019ve given the baby the honors. My sisters in laws family all think I\u2019m evil.\n\nWas this an asshole move?", "created_utc": 1693235422, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/163op3o/aita_for_refusing_to_let_my_sister_in_law_bury/", "score": 26, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Honestly, their feelings make perfect sense.\n\nAnd of course you were not an AH either to say no, or even to refuse to allow them the pictures when it became clear that in their grief they weren't going to listen to reason and might not give the dress back even after other family members asked them not to do this. You were protecting the tradition for more than just yourself, possibly even for their future children.\n\nBut they weren't AHs. Jesus. . . they didn't have a miscarriage, they had a stillborn child. Your SIL basically carried her baby almost to term only to lose her. I have a couple of friends who have been through that and over a decade later each of them still grieves those losses every day of their lives. It is one of the worst things a person can go through. They were wracked with grief and only wanted to lessen the pain, to honour their child somehow. Calling them AHs is awful and completely lacking in compassion.\n\nThere are NAH, only a heartbreaking situation and people trying to get through it the best you all can.", "YTA\n\nI get the fact that you're hurt about losing your niece... but honestly that's not your judgement to make. That's hers. It was **her** daughter who passed, not yours. You do not, under any circumstances, have the right to dictate to others how they should grieve. It's no surprise they've gone zero contact with you OP, that is seriously toxic for you to do.", "ESH.\n\nWhile it is kind of an unreasonable request of them seeing as how its a family tradition that they would be depriving everyone of, a miscarriage, especially one that late in the pregnancy is a very traumatic and monumental event for your family, one that might even call for a tradition like that to change/end to help your family move past the trauma.\n\nits certainly not just your brother/SILs call to make and they shouldn't demand it and they are the AH for not taking the rest of the family into consideration, and your Brother is also the AH for threatening to steal dress from the family as well. But it should be a discussion with the whole family about what is the best path forward, rather than you just denying them the dress outright, which makes the AH as well.\n\nTraditions change and evolve over the years as family grow and change, this one is no different and something as devastating as a late term miscarriage is as \"good\" of a reason to spur that change as any.", "[deleted]", "NTA.\n\nIt's your family tradition that you wish to carry on.  Your brother does not get to unilaterally decide to end the tradition.\n\nI understand that your brother and SIL are grieving the loss of their child and will give them some grace but do not under any circumstances give them the dress as you will then never see it again.  They need some time, and possibly therapy, to deal with their grief.", "What?\n\nNTA\n\nWhy TF do they think they get to be the last to use the dress?\n\nI'd be surprised if you _couldn't_ find other babies who had their picture taken in the dress that had either already passed or passed shortly after.\n\nIt's a _family_ dress. As far as anyone is concerned, it shouldn't stop getting used until the family ends. I'm sure someone could find a good seamstress to maintain it in the meantime.", "NTA\nWhile it's incredibly difficult to deal with grief,  it was unfair for your SIL  to try and take away a family tradition. Hopefully she and brother will see how they shouldn't have asked that at the time but emotions are running high right now. When my baby died the hospital was able to donate a dress to us for her to wear, there are many places worldwide that provide \"Angel dresses\" (including clothing for boys) for babies that will never go home. It would have been more appropriate for her family to look for something like that rather than try to take a historic dress from a family.  Let them grieve for now,  time may help them realise how selfish it was and if not then that's ok too.", "NTA- its weird that your brother expects you to let go of the same tradition they are so adamant about continuing and ending with their daughter.", "NTA\n\nYour brother pretty much went scorched earth here and stated that if you gave them the dress to take pictures with, they were going to use it however they wanted. If you lend something to someone for a particular reason, NO it does not become their property.  And you don't lend things to people who are entitled enough to SAY that out loud.", "NTA. If it's such a \"stupid tradition,\" it shouldn't bother them at all that you said no.", "NTA - heart breaking for the your brother and SIL, but no, they don't get to end a nearly 200yo tradition. Hopefully they'll calm down after they have time to process and grieve and realize you were just an outlet for their anguish. I'm sorry OP, that's a rough one.", "NTA. We have a family baptismal gown like that from the 1800s. We even put boys in it, including both my sons, and I would never let it be buried.", "NTA, your brother went nuclear on you, I don't blame you for not letting them do the photos after he made it clear you wouldn't get the dress back.\n\nIt doesn't really make sense for your niece to be the last wearer of the dress either. The dress is passed down from daughter to daughter; your brother isn't a daughter, so it would be odd for her to get the dress if she had survived. \n\nThe last wearer should be the last daughter in the line - so you, if you don't have a daughter or any sisters, or female maternal cousins.\n\nEdit: just realized you do have daughters, so yeah, the dress should obviously go to whichever of them has a daughter first.", "Nta oof, i hate to call a dude, who just had their baby die, an ahole but he literally told you that you wouldn't be getting the dress back.", "No one is. I understand why you said no and it\u2019s a family tradition, but it\u2019s only a dress. if that gave them some comfort whilst going through the worst thing possible for a parent to go through I would let them do it", "NTA. Maybe they can find (or have made) a very similar dress for the burial.\n\nLosing a child is difficult and unimaginable, so I can understand emotions being high. Hopefully, they'll realize later that it would be unfair to the future girls of the family (hopefully another one of their own) not to be able to participate in the tradition. I hope you all can reestablish your relationships as well once emotions are back to a more regular state.", "NTA  \nYour SIL family all think youre evil because its not their family's dress.\n\nThis dress is an heirloom, and a wonderful tradition over almost 200 years. It is the kind of thing that families do, they hand special things down through the generations.\n\nIt is extremely selfish of your brother and his wife to unilaterally decide that THEIR child should be the last one to wear it AND to lay claim to the dress 'once you give it to them'. \n\nThey dont own it, and you wouldnt be giving it to them, you would be loaning it to them for the traditional photo. \n\nThey are hurting, but that doesnt give them the right to take something away from future generations of your family.", "Nta, I can empathize with their grief but they want to stop a tradition to show how special their child was, that isn\u2019t fair to the rest of the family.  I get the thought process of how in their grief they don\u2019t want anyone else to celebrate and it puts a physical aspect to their sadness. Still doesn\u2019t make it right for everyone else. Life is for the living. \n\nYou made the right decision to not let your brother have the dress after his threat. Only time will see if they can understand why you said no and appreciate the dress is for celebration and not mourning", "NTA. This isn't a sutuatio where you're in the wrong. They were going to be allowed to photograph the baby in the dress, as is tradition before they threatened to steal it. This is not SIL's legacy. You are well within rights and reason to say they dont get to keep the dress and if they are going to force the issue they can't use it. They can be disappointed but they don't get to steal the dress because they want something special.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It has only been from mother to daughter. My female cousins from my uncle never wore it. My brother didn\u2019t care about the tradition but his wife was REALLY interested in it.

I\u2019m not sure if your parents are still alive but could your mom or another sibling/family member intervene and bring them the dress and explain the importance of keeping it for other female family members.
