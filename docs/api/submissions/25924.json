I think helping him is great, but you likely weren't dealing eith a drug user and mentally unstable teen for years so I think you're being incredibly hard on her. A parent should 100% support their kids, but often times adults and teen kids don't want help and they lash out. The 12 year old (now 17) is your sister's kid too.

She told stepniece to shut up and that she shouldn't have been there, since it was a meeting with nephew's parents.
