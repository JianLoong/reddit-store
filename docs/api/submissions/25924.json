I think the niece would know first hand what it was like being around her undiagnosed unmedicated brother.", "NTA, sounds like the step daughter is a chip of step mothers block. Block them all and never look back.", "Concentrate on your nephew and don\u2019t let them fuckers anywhere near him! What a shame on that poor boy, parents should never let a child be homeless! Good on you!", "ESH except the Nephew, the niece for saying awful things, your sister for enabling her at the expense of her other child, the ex BIL for caring so little about this meeting that he showed up high, and you for deciding that your step niece's biology is more important in that moment that the simple fact that your sister was enabling one of her kids to hurt the other", "NTA. The step daughter shouldn\u2019t have been there in the first place. Your sister should\u2019ve shut her down after her first remark. \n\nYour sister needs to grow tf up. I don\u2019t blame your nephew\u2019s father for being upset. He was being attacked by a random teenage girl who shouldn\u2019t have even been there & his ex allowed her to be disrespectful. \n\nThe daughter had no right to say anything & was completely out of line & her disrespect should\u2019ve been shut down. \n\nHonestly you should\u2019ve asked her to leave after her first remark especially when you noticed your sister was fine allowing her disrespect. \n\nI feel for your nephew his mother is so damn immature that she can\u2019t get her shit together to have a civil conversation & be in the same room as her ex for something important. \n\nI understand if it\u2019s important to him to tell his parents but they\u2019re childish & clearly aren\u2019t going to change. Have him meet with them separately to tell them. \n\nYour sister owes her son an apology for allowing her stepdaughter to ruin his important meeting.", "NTA.  Who gives a shit about the stepsister in this sad post? How is your nephew doing?  Sounds like he had a chaotic upbringing by a couple of narcissists, so maybe bipolar disorder or maybe PTSD? \n\nHe needed to tell his parents about his diagnosis, so you attempted to create the space and opportunity for him to do that, but they were not receiving it.  They made the meeting about themselves and offered no comfort or support to their son.  So now they know, and now he knows that they are incapable of being there for him. \n\nContinue to love and help him, he needs you.", "From the behavior of all the adults - you included -  I can understand why your nephew struggles. I hope he can eventually find some people who actually support him and offer healthy relationships, because none of you knows anything an how to do that. ESH (except the kid).", "Ah I see. Either way you are definitely NTA and your sister is a raging ah for being so callous towards her son. StepD should never have been present at all.", "Whoops!  Thanks for the clarification.", "If it was a discussion for the whole family, then why wasn't the step father they're? OP's nephew wanted a chance to talk to his parents and his mom couldn't be bothered to show up to support him", "You also don\u2019t know what she went through. You\u2019re only going hard because of what YOU went through/put others through. Your story isn\u2019t the same as hers. The post details her causing unnecessary issues when it was about the nephew, not her.  You know nothing about OP\u2019s family besides what OP wrote.  You\u2019re projecting your own story. OP is NTA for supporting nephew.", "I just want to say that seeing you here, in the posts and the comments, being so firm but also gentle, and never wavering in your staunch and unflinching support of your nephew, is healing a small corner of this formerly mentally ill child's heart. I survived it, and at 43 I have found a measure of peace and am content, but I would have considered having someone like you in my corner those many years ago to have been one of the biggest blessings of my life. You and your boyfriend are good people and are doing a wonderful job as your nephew's advocates and family, and this internet stranger is thrilled and proud. Thank you.", "And just because you know 1 bipolar person doesn't mean your the expert on all bipolar sibling relationships. My husband is bipolar and was around the same age as OP's nephew when he got diagnosed. I'm close with both of his younger sisters and neither of them have trauma stemming from his undiagnosed/unmedicated bipolar.", "Your step niece IS the bad guy because of her snarky commentary.  In fact, they all sucked. I'm so sorry for your nephew and I hope he gets the help he needs. \n\nNTA", "NTA and speaking as someone who is bipolar that may be a significant part of both why nephew has a hard time holding down a job and why he's high a lot (or was, maybe he's toned it down since moving in with you?). Self medicating is extremely common for people with untreated bipolar. I did it with alcohol all through my 20s (I'm 43 now).\n\nIt wasn't until my bipolar was treated and under control that I was able to hold a job for more than a few months. I've been at my current job for 2 years now and it's been mostly a good 2 years.\n\nIt's difficult for me to overstate how important it is that he gets proper treatment for his bipolar. Doing so has turned my life from practically a living hell mentally (I would regularly get so depressed I couldn't get out of bed and stay that way for MONTHS unless I was drinking) and now I'm here for my family and able to hold down my job (I'm a software engineer).", "This is legitimately making me tear up (and that\u2019s not common for me). Your bf sounds wonderful and I wish the best for your nephew. I have family and friends who are bipolar so I know secondhand how difficult it can be, and his parents seem to have only made it much more difficult. Best of luck and ty for showing up for him.", "NTA. Your step niece is 17, she should fucking know better. You, your boyfriend, and your nephew  are the only ones in this story that aren\u2019t TAs. I am so sorry for your nephew, I get how it is to get diagnosed with something like that at his age. It\u2019s hard. And it\u2019s even harder when you\u2019re the ignored child. You and your boyfriend are angels to that kid. Props to you for giving him that chance, and props to him for allowing y\u2019all to have him tested so he could better himself.", "Y'all crazy on this sub. \n\nYes, the step daughter was an AH and it's good that you stood up for your nephew. HOWEVER. Your question is whether you're TA for the insistence on blood relation vs her step relation, and for that,  YES YTA. Blood isn't everything. How many other questions on this sub do people get upset for parents treating their step kid as lesser than? And now here suddenly that's forgotten. \n\nLook, obviously your sister and her stepdaughter are AHs in general, but making this issue about the blood relation vs the actual issue makes you also TA, and that's specifically what you asked for judgement on.", "NTA Step kid is is an asshole, 17 is old enough to shut the hell up when people are talking about sensitive subjects.", "NTA.  I feel it\u2019s your moral obligation to explain to your nephew that going NC is an option and may be the best thing for his mental health and development as an individual.", "Well, I think they might truly both be related, they\u2019re both assholes, a common trait between the two.", "I mean, if an kid is being an asshole, some people are going to call them an asshole, it\u2019s simple and blunt.", "Shouldn't it be ESH, considering the niece's actions and the sister acting like she did nothing wrong?", "NTA, it was a \"fuck around and find out\" situation..... your sister and her brat step daughter suck", "NTA  - your sister, ex BIL and step child all sound like awful people. \n\nYour nephew didn't stand a chance with them. \n\nYou've quite likely saved his life by taking him in and getting him the help he needs. You and your boyfriend are good people. \n\nIt sounds like he'd be better off staying away from all of them, he's got a safe place to do so now and while it won't be easy, being abandoned by your parents, he's got you there for support. Keep him focused on getting well, keep him loved and supported and away from his shitty family.", "NTA Your step niece has an advocate in your sister. Your nephew has an advocate in you.", "Just like everyone else, I think NTA.\n\nThis situation is so fucked up and I got the urge to cry. I'm so sorry for your nephew. I hope he can find happiness. You are a great aunt, thank you for sticking for him.", "See I read it as \"well my actual kid is fucked beyond fixing, so this is my chance to prove it's not my fault and I'm a great mom!\"", "NTA but what did you expect. Obviously they\u2019ve washed their hands of him and are crappy or fed up people.", "NTA. But I really don't get the need to tell the parents together, when it was clear that they couldn't be in the same room together and clearly don't care that much about their son. Why couldn't he tell them separately?", "Or she wanted a daughter, not a son."]}
