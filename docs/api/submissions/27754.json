Reagan and Tanner go to daycare together, even though they have a live-in nanny.

Tagg is teaching Tanner how to be a baseball player like him. Tanner is just like Tagg when he was 3. As a result, Tagg spends a lot of time with Tanner and has taught him some skills like letters, words and some reading.

She said that teachers these days were just \u201cvery lazy\u201d. \r  \n\r  \nI was pressing her about this and she went on to complain about how teachers \u201calways complain\u201d and need to \u201cbabysit the kids more\u201d, and she told me \u201cto be honest, I look down on these teachers, they just want pity\u201d, she then asked me not to tell our youngest brother this.

I agree that your sister's attitude towards teachers leaves a lot to be desired. However, I do agree with her that a teacher's job is to teach (especially in preschool), not to sort kids into being advanced or behind. That's just simply ridiculous.  \n\nThree-year olds are expected to be all over the place as regards their development. Many will catch up and surpass their \"more advanced\" peers as soon as they hit school; sometimes, this happens as late as adulthood. Unlike her brother, your niece has no one interacting with her on her letters and numbers.
