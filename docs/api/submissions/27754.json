I agree that your sister's attitude towards teachers leaves a lot to be desired. However, I do agree with her that a teacher's job is to teach (especially in preschool), not to sort kids into being advanced or behind. That's just simply ridiculous.  \n\nThree-year olds are expected to be all over the place as regards their development. Many will catch up and surpass their \"more advanced\" peers as soon as they hit school; sometimes, this happens as late as adulthood. Unlike her brother, your niece has no one interacting with her on her letters and numbers.  What else would anyone expect but for her to not be as skilled as he is on those things that he's studying?\n\nYou stirred up a needless tempest by blabbing some ridiculous comment by your sister to your brother.

She can't educate 9 with a live-in nanny.", "Theyre mormon, so... sort of?", "How involved the parents are is often a very strong predictor of how well kids do in school. It's not because teachers aren't teaching, it's because being invited to engage with and to take interest and subject materials when you're out in the world doing things you like and having someone who you can talk through the things you're learning with is really really helpful to actually internalizing information. Teachers are going to notice when some kids pick up and retain information faster than others, it's just how it is. And while preschool is early enough that the differences don't have a lot of predictive power, the teacher is right to acknowledge that the two kids are not getting equal support and that it's the parent's job to make that even because the teacher literally can't. The teacher cannot play the role in the kid's life outside of school that would enable those changes. And the parents' willingness to put that effort in is going to matter a lot as the kids get older.\n\nAdditionally failing to sort kids by who's ahead and who's behind is actually doing kids something of a disservice. You want to teach kids where they are at. If you're teaching everyone at the same level, the kids who are behind are going to struggle and the kids who are ahead are going to be bored as hell. Take it from someone who's been on both sides of that problem in different subjects, you do not want the people who really struggle with the material and the people who pick it up incredibly fast in the same class doing the same medium difficulty work.", "It's all the MLM cash, hon \ud83d\udcb8\n\nSeriously tho, with over a billion in assets from forcing everyone in the cult to tithe, I guess there is plenty of cash floating around in the desert", "They also make machine guns lol.

Because if you play in college, you are generally too old for the draft (roll eyes!).\n\nBut getting a practical degree on someone else's dime is always a great plan :)", "Many college baseball players get drafted, and a lot are signed as free agents. The issue is a player at a 2 yr school can be drafted after his first or second year (this may have changed since I was playing). Players at a 4 yr school can't be drafted until after their 3rd year and then after their 4th yr. \n\nThe thing is now for younger players the number of year round leagues and \"travel\" teams are really risking overuse injuries for kids that have not finished growing. \n\nI haven't  seen the numbers for a while, but the drop off in number of players at each level really drops a lot from HS to college to minor leagues to the major league teams is really steep. \n\nEven for those that are drafted and get a signing bonus the pay at the lower pro levels is so low they all need jobs for the off season. \n\nI got my first 2 yrs paid for, had some eye problems and didn't get recruited by a 4 yr school or an offer to play in minors, but  my grades got me into a top tier engineering school for a degree. \n\nAlso, for most players I agree it's the knees and shoulders, for pitchers add the elbow."]}
