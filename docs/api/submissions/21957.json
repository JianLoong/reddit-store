I told her this was wrong and she shouldn\u2019t have had any bridal shower at all if this is how it was gonna be. \n\nMy husband reached out to her fianc\u00e9 the day of the wedding to apologize. I told me daughter he never responded and it takes a big man to apologize. She responded with I think he\u2019s blocked on his phone still. I told her she needed to tell him to read it. She never answered later telling me I should have just apologized in person if it meant that much because I was filling her big day with drama and she didn\u2019t want to deal with it.
