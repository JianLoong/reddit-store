With that amount of time things got somewhat serious. Although when college came around it became long distance and things quickly fell apart from there. After we broke off we cut off communication. Although she would routinely text me every now and then asking for favors or saying things I considered to be odd. \n\nShe would text me and say she was wearing the necklace I got her. Or ask for $100 to get her car out of impound a few things like that. (I didn\u2019t give her the money to get the car out). Which brings us around to where we are now a few months ago she asked me to pick her up from our local airport. It\u2019s maybe 30 mins away not a big deal. I did go through asking if literally anyone else could pick her up. \n\nEventually I reluctantly agreed to pick her up and drop her off if she gave me my hoodie back. She agreed. At the time I pick her up I find out she didn\u2019t bring my hoodie. I end up dropping her off at a friends house she thanked me and said she would Venmo me for gas money. Here\u2019s the twist no one was expecting she didn\u2019t pay my shocker. (Picking her up from the airport on the Friday before labor weekend) I didn\u2019t hear from here for a while. \n\nShe ended up adding me back on snap. We did snap back and forth for a while. We talked about everything that happened between us and I finally started to get a feeling of closure. Which was a relief. Anyways I got the impression she was kinda flirting a little through out this. Granted a lot of it was backhanded complements like wow you learned how to dress, and why did you have to get more attractive after we broke up. We do this for maybe a month or two then she ask me for another ride from the airport. Once again I told her I would if she brought my hoodie. \n\nAnyways I pick her up and once again no hoodie was returned. I drop her off again and she says thank you and such. She told me she would bring it back when she comes back during thanks giving break. This conversation was in late October maybe 5 days ago. Anyways I go home after dropping her off and a few hours later I noticed she removed me on snap. I texted her saying \u201cunadded me on snap?\u201d She ignored the text and hasn\u2019t responded. I\u2019ve been considering what to do. My main idea is just a paragraph saying you don\u2019t want to talk that\u2019s fine just drop my hoodie off at my house when ur back in town. I\u2019ve given her plenty of opportunities where I went to here to get the hoodie and I\u2019m not sure I want to see her again much less interact as it just bring back memories that would be easier to just forget. \n\nBut given how she has flaked on it twice part of me is contemplating texting her mom and ask her to remind her daughter. I got to know the parents Farley well and she said she missed having me around not to long ago. So I feel like it wouldn\u2019t be completely out of turn to do that.
