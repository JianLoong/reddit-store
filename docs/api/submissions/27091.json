To the mother.\n\nIt is extremely inappropriate for a parent to involve their teenager in these decades-old financial arrangements and family spites passed down through generations.\n\nYour mother is not too old to use Reddit for herself if she wants to. \n\nThis is a family dynamic called enmeshment - when the parent involves the child in too many details to further their own agenda. \n\nWatch out. Your mother's judgement and financial strings will surely impact your life too someday.", "NTA.

She subsidized all of this. \n\nThe kind of people they were was made thoroughly clear when they asked to be given a house.\n\nNot to mention, by that point OP's Mom had already been enabling the behavior for years.\n\nThey are takers and users and entitled as fuck.\n\nNonetheless, OP's Mom kept \"helping\" (in actuality, enabling). Until they grabbed grabbed grabbed even beyond her tolerance.\n\nKind of impressive, in a terrible way, how much they were able to drain from OP's Mom. They had her number for quite some time.", "\nINFO- Did your mother originally provide Sam and Mila with a monthly assistance at their request or her generosity?\n\nYes, people who keep having kids they can\u2019t afford and expect others to pay for them are AHs\u2026but so are people who use their money to control others, and who think they are better than others for it. \n\nReceiving financial assistance from a family member does not automatically make you selfish or entitled, just as having a wealthy/successful family member does not automatically make you poor or irresponsible.\n\nI don\u2019t think that a medical clerk and a teacher having four kids is automatically irresponsible in the eyes of an person who isn\u2019t wealthy or \u201cbetter than\u201d. Depending on where you live, this seems like an average blue-collar/middle class family. With both parents working respectable jobs, it doesn\u2019t sound like the kids are \u201cstarving to death\u201d, as your mother insinuated they\u2019d allow.\n\nTo play devils advocate\u2026 I can imagine Sam & Mila as just a normal hard working married couple who wanted to have a big family, which is their choice. They have a successful family member who helps them out financially (as many do), which is incredible. This family member also judges their personal choices, looks down on them, and shares this sentiment with them as well as others, which sucks. \n\nIf Sam & Mila demanded your mother buy them a house, that would make them AHs, but I have a feeling that isn\u2019t the full story. This is pure speculation, but you only know of this second-hand story as told by a biased party with an interest in embellishing her side.\n\n-Perhaps your mother was discussing her desire to invest in real estate and Mila expressed how she wishes that she too could afford a big house. Your mother suggested this idea that Sam & Mila live rent-free in her home, and they ultimately decided against it (because who wants to live in a house owned by an overbearing family member?), and your mother took offense to them \u201cwanting their own house\u201d (which is different than them demanding she buy them one.)\n\n-Perhaps Mila asked your mother if she could help them qualify for a mortgage or  give them a loan for a down payment so they could buy a bigger home, and your mother counter-offered to let them live in her property rent-free. They wouldn\u2019t be AHs for asking since your mother had established that she was willing to help them in general, your mother wouldn\u2019t have been an AH for saying no if she felt she\u2019d already helped enough , And they weren\u2019t AHs for declining her alternate suggestion either. Beggars can\u2019t be choosers, but asking a family member with money for something for your family that is within the scope of their ability and precedent does not automatically make you a beggar. \n\nMy husband was super offended when his little sister declined an offer to live for free in a condo that he\u2019d buy(in husbands name). He was outraged at the lack of gratitude and the audacity for someone who has less than him to want more for themselves than he offered to gift them. I told my husband he was being a total jerk. My cousin lives in a home I own rent-free, and I wouldn\u2019t dream of getting involved in his personal life\u2026it\u2019s not related to my real estate and none of my business.\n\nIf you are successful enough to help family, you can either be a godsend or a nightmare to them, depending on the way you handle it. It sounds like your mother used her position of power over her brother to justify thinking less of him, speaking poorly of him, and to control his life in inappropriate ways. Giving someone money doesn\u2019t make them entitled. Thinking you the right to decide how many kids they have because you have them money is entitled.\n\nIt sounds like Sam & Mila only took your mother up on her offer when it was a last resort after Covid, which devastated a lot of families. That couldn\u2019t have been easy for them. Your mom stepped up by providing shelter, but was a total asshole for giving the condition of how many kids he could have with his wife. This is not a family moving in to a spare bedroom in your house, this is a 6 bedroom mansion they will occupy all to themselves. It does not affect your mom if they have 2 more kids \u2026she didn\u2019t even know at first! Your mom was an AH for being so openly & unnecessarily opinionated about her brothers family decisions. It\u2019s not like he was demanding a raise in his monthly allowance per child!\n\nEntitled family members are AHs, but nothing compares to the assholery of a rich older sibling using their money to make you feel and look bad. This is using a superpower for evil.", "This was painful to read. Your parents are so rich they couldn't afford to educate you?", "Mila\u2019s mother had passed away, some months before the lease. She used her part of the estate for ivf. How do we know that ? The screaming match after the eviction notice, ensued this conversation.", "Mila\u2019s mother had passed away, some months before the lease. She used her part of the estate for ivf. How do we know that ? The screaming match after the eviction notice, ensued this conversation.", "She helped them because two of their kids had disability : a full physical disability since birth, and another was on the spectrum. \nThey ASKED for suppprt from the entire family and kin.\nThey were OFFENDED that my mother was keeping the house in her name, and not gifting it to them because she could AFFFORD to. \n\nIf you would have read correctly, it was 7 years ago. They lived in the Bay Area, where my mum was temporarily posted for 3 years, otherwise we lived in the D.C. . We had moved after her posting was over, but than she was put on another temporary posting in Cali. \n\nMy mothers basic and logical reasoning, why add more kids to the misery, when you can\u2019t take care of the first 4. They had children with disability, and with no substantial hike in income, they wanted more children. \nTo clear, my mum\u2019s assistance went in two ways - for support for the two kids and for helping their health insurance and some money for the other two kids.", "How well can you write in your second language?", "My bad, I read showdown as shutdown and thought it was a Covid reference. Regardless, my opinion stands that if you chose to help family financially you are an asshole for thinking that it entitles you to a say in their family planning choices"]}
