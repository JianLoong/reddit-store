If the consensus is that I'm an AH and I'm truly as entitled as the title sounds I'll call and apologize. \n\nI (36F) have a son (11M) In 6th grade we'll call \"Preston\" which a teacher we'll call \"Susan\"(50+F?) Some important background is that Preston is pretty skittish and jumpy, he easily gets startled by noises or voices he does not expect, especially if they are loud. I only have seen Susan in person like twice but she has a distinctly loud, almost thunderous voice, never heard her yell yet though, but Preston says it always makes him jump a little and apparently she's known for being ridiculously loud in general from other kids and parents. \n\nAnyway, I WFH And I got a voicemail on my phone from Preston using a school phone saying he got detention, because Susan yelled at some kids fooling around during worktime, he was startled, and she noticed so she made him leave the room, work in the hallway and call me to tell him he has to serve detention next week. I did not believe that was the reason he got detention at all because that sounds really dumb and assumed he was just minimizing his role(He does tend to do that when explaining his side when in trouble) so I thought I'd get Susan's side at recess while I went to lunch. I call her and I was completely caught off guard when what she said lined up with everything Preston said to a T. I wasn't sure what to say at first, but I ended up just laughing on the phone before any words could come out. Susan was irritated and asked what was so funny and I just responded that I was so sure that Preston was lying to me, because that was such a ridiculous reason to give anyone detention and that he is not serving detention just for being startled. \n\nShe tells me that this is not a suggestion and that I'm being obtuse. I stood firm and asked her if she'd think it appropriate if her boss yelled loudly at some fellow teachers, you were startled and then he proceeded to dock HER pay or some other form of punishment, following up with I bet she didn't even do jack squat to the kids she was INITIALLY yelling at after noticing Preston. She got quiet for a moment and I thought maybe I convinced her, but then she doubled down and said that  failing to serve detention would result in suspension or more, and I told her I'd gladly fight her and the school on this if it came to that before hanging up. I do not intend to punish Preston just for getting startled, we all do it and it's nothing worth making any issue out of. If I'm being honest the only reason chose to post is because I vented to my friend about this later and she actually did not side with me, saying that I was kind of being a dick to laugh at Susan and that teachers don't get paid enough to deal with the things I said, so I wanna hear what unbiased people think.

It's time to talk to the bosses boss.", "What a stupid reason for detention!!!\n\nI startle very easily and I tend to get angry when I'm startled. It's like a fight response.\n\nI have shouted obscenities at church for being startled by the organ. I have shouted at my manager for startling me when I was working.\n\nNo one, and I do mean no one, ever makes it a big deal.\n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nI had to read it twice and checked if I know what \u201cstartled\u201d means (not a native) just to be sure. Your son got detention *for being startled*. My mind is blown.", "NTA. What teacher did was way over the top. But ...\nNow I don't have a startle response at all, but I do purely hate loud noises, especially people yelling. Had this one professor, my very first semester in college, who sounded like a sonic boom every time he opened his mouth. So here I am, trapped in a small computer lab with a \"thunder storm\" in my ear, for almost 3 hours, 3 days a week. It was nerve wracking. I damn near quit college because of that guy! He was that obnoxious.\n\nCome to find out, he was partially deaf and couldn't help it. Which makes me wonder about your kids teacher. Food for thought.", "Our entire department is often startled (we somehow never expect the weekly fire alarm practise and one of our managers sneezes like he\u2019s auditioning for a West End show).

Just because teachers don't get paid enough, doesn't mean they get to be AHs to kids and give out arbitrary punishments to make themselves feel better. I'd definitely speak to the principle immediately about her methods cos they could be so detrimental to other kids. \n\nYou can't punish a kid for being startled. That's ridiculous. There can be legitimate trauma based reasons for kids being jumpy. Going straight to punishment is not an acceptable course of action for a teacher. Luckily, it sounds like that doesn't apply to OPs kid, but how would she know? And other kids might not be in the same boat.", "One of my colleagues is LEGENDARY for being easily startled, even if you think she should see or hear you coming. Even when we try not to! Heck, she even startled herself coming into my office to see me once! \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 If we docked her pay every time she was startled at work, she\u2019d be paying to work there!

It reminds me of the teacher I had as a kid that would send you to the principal for yawning. It's like, everyone yawns. You can't always control it. And I don't mean audibly yawning to be a dick, I would kind of get doing that, but kids would get sent to the principal for quietly yawning while covering their mouth to try and hide it. Getting startled is a natural human instinct, it's not exactly something he could do anything about. I'd absolutely fight this, too.", "I honestly doubt this is what happened.  The \u201cstudent\u201d gets startled and is forced to leave class.  This is unreal, due to the teacher shortage there are so many iep students and a student that gets startled at noises would be very high up their iep.", "Yeah NTA no one should be punished for an uncontrollable reaction to something like this, getting startled is absolutely not an acceptable thing to be punished for. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong in defending your son. Teachers don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with the trash they deal with but you were totally reasonable.", "Exactly. Especially kids in your care. Especially when you can't possibly know the root of those involuntary actions.", "Exactly this. I've mentioned this in my comments too.

That makes absolutely zero sense to punish him for that lol I wonder who's side the school will take", "Too many of them get a rush from power tripping.", "Idk, respect is earned. Sounds like she can't control her emotions/temper when working with kids (it's inappropriate to be yelling at work imo) but then is expecting more emotional regulation from the kids than she has herself. Maybe she was embarrassed that she yelled so loudly and OP's son basically \"called her out\" (unintentionally) by being so startled.", "Respect is earned.  I see nothing wrong with laughing at the complete ridiculousness of what the teacher chose to do.  I disagree any apology is due unless SHE apologizes for her wrongful act.", "I think you misread, he did not leave class because he was startled, the teacher kicked him out of the room. Literally all he did was jump a bit in his seat from a loud noise.", "Jrm, I normally agree with you on most judgements on posts we find but this time I gotta say this is a really awful take. Unless Preston was like, screaming or something, there\u2019s no reason he should have been forced out of the room let alone have to serve a detention.", "Lol, a startle response is not something to punish a kid for. Sometimes adults are the unreasonable ones in a situation, they're not always right. Sounds like the teacher is on a power trip.", "The teacher escalated the situation. True there is every chance she'll make his life hell, so Op might want to consider that.

The coworker is an easy target too, all you gotta do is walk into her blind spot, stand back and wait. She will jump every time.", "And no...NTA for laughing at stupidity!", "Anyone can startle easily but not have an iep.  I do not know where you live where ieps are so easily come by.   Neither of my 2 autistic children had ieps.

Well done for standing up for your kid.", "I was thinking what if a child had been abused or lived in a chaotic household and therefore would reflexively cower or protect themselves any time an arm or hand is raised or they catch that movement out of the corner of their eye.

My claim is she earned a little disrespect after acting in such a manner.  \"She's still the teacher\" doesn't give her a pass.  \n\nI do agree it would be reasonable to see if the son has an actual issue.", "Nobody was disturbed, if Susan is so offended that her yelling is so loud that it startles a student that was working that's her problem.", "If he was disruptive, the teacher would\u2019ve said that, no? OP called specifically because she thought there were additional details as to why Preston got in trouble. But the teacher corroborated the story. He just had a startled reflex response.", "Well sure, laughing was not smart in hindsight, but I dont think its an AH move exactly. She only called because she understandably assumed there was more to the story and was flabbergasted when it turned out to be as ridiculous as it sounded. Assuming OP gets to the principal about this ASAP I think she can recover the little fumble about laughing at the teacher.", "It\u2019s not and I completely agree.
