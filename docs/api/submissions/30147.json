If the consensus is that I'm an AH and I'm truly as entitled as the title sounds I'll call and apologize. \n\nI (36F) have a son (11M) In 6th grade we'll call \"Preston\" which a teacher we'll call \"Susan\"(50+F?) Some important background is that Preston is pretty skittish and jumpy, he easily gets startled by noises or voices he does not expect, especially if they are loud. I only have seen Susan in person like twice but she has a distinctly loud, almost thunderous voice, never heard her yell yet though, but Preston says it always makes him jump a little and apparently she's known for being ridiculously loud in general from other kids and parents. \n\nAnyway, I WFH And I got a voicemail on my phone from Preston using a school phone saying he got detention, because Susan yelled at some kids fooling around during worktime, he was startled, and she noticed so she made him leave the room, work in the hallway and call me to tell him he has to serve detention next week. I did not believe that was the reason he got detention at all because that sounds really dumb and assumed he was just minimizing his role(He does tend to do that when explaining his side when in trouble) so I thought I'd get Susan's side at recess while I went to lunch. I call her and I was completely caught off guard when what she said lined up with everything Preston said to a T. I wasn't sure what to say at first, but I ended up just laughing on the phone before any words could come out. Susan was irritated and asked what was so funny and I just responded that I was so sure that Preston was lying to me, because that was such a ridiculous reason to give anyone detention and that he is not serving detention just for being startled. \n\nShe tells me that this is not a suggestion and that I'm being obtuse. I stood firm and asked her if she'd think it appropriate if her boss yelled loudly at some fellow teachers, you were startled and then he proceeded to dock HER pay or some other form of punishment, following up with I bet she didn't even do jack squat to the kids she was INITIALLY yelling at after noticing Preston. She got quiet for a moment and I thought maybe I convinced her, but then she doubled down and said that  failing to serve detention would result in suspension or more, and I told her I'd gladly fight her and the school on this if it came to that before hanging up. I do not intend to punish Preston just for getting startled, we all do it and it's nothing worth making any issue out of. If I'm being honest the only reason chose to post is because I vented to my friend about this later and she actually did not side with me, saying that I was kind of being a dick to laugh at Susan and that teachers don't get paid enough to deal with the things I said, so I wanna hear what unbiased people think.

I could see if your son was truly acting up or disrupting her class but that doesn't appear to be the case at all. It's important for kids to face appropriate consequences if they act up but it's just as important for parents to show their children that they will have their back and stand up for them if their child is falsely accused or treated unfairly. You're not only teaching your son to stand up for what's right but you're also further building his trust in you as his mom and that's some great parenting in my book.

It's useful to have a term that encompasses a wide variety of diagnoses that people may have, which lead them to face similar challenges in school, the workplace, and life in general.", "While it appears that the term was originally developed with an intent to minimalize the disability aspects of things like ADHD (there are some issues with the person who coined it), I and many others with one of these issues like the term as there is often overlap between symptoms and comorbid issues.\n\nSo as someone with ADHD, I am happy for us to take ownership of the word and use it to simplify conversations, rather than try and start listing out issues like ADHD, autism, cerebral palsy, etc. We have some shared experiences coping with the world and difficulties in getting treatment.\n\nIf you don't care for the word, feel free to try and coin a new one that is catchy enough that others start using it.", "And that\u2019s really bad if you think about it bc they could hire sex offenders and violent offenders and without that background check they have no clue", "A lot of the boys who are bullies grow up to be cops", "you're correct, its like how a lot of the bully boys become cops. they want to keep their power trips up and get paid to be bullies. though i have to say i think the teachers are the worst, they choose to go after kids specifically.", "oh I didn't know that, I guess then it makes it ok when they abuse their power as they need to vent every now and then.", "I hope you\u2019re in a better place now \ud83e\udd70", "> It\u2019s not a diagnosis but auditory over stimulation is absolutely a normal feature of autism. \n\nYes, it is!\n\nHowever, that doesn't mean that having exactly *one thing* that is common among autistics *and other groups of people* is diagnostic of autism. It's really not.", "I get startled easily; if you're telling me that means i have autism then you are an idiot.\n\nThis comment is just bonkers. Sudden weight gain is a symptom of some cancers - do you go around saying that anybody who's put on weight might have cancer?", "Ah my mother who made me so terrified of teachers (and all adults) yelling or being mad at or near me as a child was a teacher by profession.\n\nWe are now estranged and I am certain she had kids and trained as a teacher entirely to make sure every day was a power trip for her because a) she hated teaching and b) didn\u2019t like mothering but turned down better paid trainer roles and took me out of boarding school to carry on being a power tripper.\n\nShe is divorced, friendless, estranged from at least one child and when I used to meet her students they would give a slow gasp and go \u2018shit, I thought nothing would be worse than being taught by her but she\u2019s your mum\u2026\u2019\n\nAs I got older people who had been taught by her used to buy me drinks, offer favours etc to show their commiserations and I repaid it by validating that yes she had likely utterly fucked their skills, grades or self esteem impacted their life for years while other people said \u2018we all had a teacher we didn\u2019t like!\u2019\n\nShe was an educational terrorist. Her school retired her early in the end. If they hadn\u2019t been able to their back up plan was just not telling her where their new campus was. I still meet former co workers who have a thousand yard stare from dealing with her. Everyone asks why she became a teacher and I reply \u2018because what other job pays you to hate kids and make it a \u2018valid\u2019 thing?\u2019 They look shocked but you can\u2019t sugarcoat it.", "Yes, that's exactly it. Or they go into nursing or social Work or policing- anywhere they'll have power over vulnerable people who are unlikely to be believed if they speak up.", "This is facts too. Cops and military.", "Thanks, that\u2019s very kind of you. And I am! I only surround myself with people I trust and make me happy, and I think I owe that to my early experiences with people that were turds lol.", "I know", "I always wonder if people like this ever realise what they are and regret it years later.\n\nMy stepmother was friendless, ended up with both my family and hers All going NC and ex work colleagues always laugh about her when they realise my relationship. Same story everytime, she'd act like she was their boss, when she was equal or even below them, get huffy when they didn't fear her and end up working by herself for the short time she'd last (before usually angering the boss and getting fired).", "Just in case you don\u2019t know: You\u2019re getting downvoted for saying \u201csounds like\u201d instead of \u201cit\u2019s also common with autism\u201d\n\nIt makes it prescriptive instead of just adding additional relevant information."]}
